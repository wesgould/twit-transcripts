Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  From SmarterWear.org and the author of The Complete Guide to Google Wave at CompleteWaveGuide.com.  Hi Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hi, great to be here today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good to see you.  You won't be bored today.  We're not going to talk about the iPad.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, well a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A little bit, but it'll be all negative, so that'll make you feel good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Awesome.  I need some affirmation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're going to have Jeff Jarvis's boxing video.  Jeff Jarvis from BuzzMachine.com, professor of journalism at the City University of New  York and former Claremont McKenna student.  Oh my, yeah.  I'm going down to Scripps tomorrow to visit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's the latest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we're waiting.  We've got four schools.  Has Jake decided?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We were at Rochester yesterday, and I think it's leading at the clubhouse turn.  Rochester, the city, didn't do itself any service.  It snowed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good.  You want him to know what he's in for.  Yeah.  One of the schools Abby's considering barred is also upper New York state.  Unfortunately, it's going to be gorgeous weather when she goes.  The good news is it's going to be like eight different flights she has to take to get there,  because she has to fly to Albany.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What are you rooting for, Dad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm rooting for Scripps.  But don't tell Abby that, because she won't go if she knows.  I got an email from the IT director at Scripps.  This is down in Claremont, California, down in LA County.  It's a five school consortium.  Scripps is one of the five, Claremont five.  He's a fan.  He's a listener.  He says, you know, we have gigabit to the pillow.  I said, what?  They have wired up all these students at Scripps for gigabit Ethernet in their dorm room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's it.  That's fantastic.  If it were me.  I'll do a sex change operation to go there, but I'll do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If it were me, I'd be like, you're done.  But Abby goes, yeah, so what?  Yeah.  OK, what else they got?  So it's her.  You know what?  She's going to have to be there for four years.  I write the checks, but she's going to have to be there for four years.  So I guess she should choose.  So we got a lot of stories to talk about, Jeff and Gina.  It's just the three of us.  We made some room for Howard Stern's IT guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He couldn't do it because he's coaching soccer, likely excuse.  Jeff Schick.  But I'm going to visit him on April 26th to get the full tour of what happens.  And this week, in fact, I called him to the Stern show twice.  Howard was going on again about us making fun of him for his OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He never just says something once, does he?  He's got to...  Oh, he recycles.  It's beat a dead horse.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And so I called back in and we had a discussion about the iPad, by the way.  And he said that he didn't see any use for it.  And that went on.  And the next day, Jeff Schick, the IBM guy for Lotus Notes, had to come into the studio,  I think sent by his corporate betters, because he had to defend Lotus Notes against me.  So of course I called in again and laughed at him.  And so we're getting together on the 26th and I'll see his full view.  And I think we'll get him on the show.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wonder if he gets gigabit to the schnoz.  If he doesn't, he's not a good IT guy.  So Jeff, Jeff, Jeff, you've posted a video or you will soon.  It's not up as we speak, but soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's up on YouTube, not on my blog yet.  I saved it for you, Leo and Jada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So go to budgemachine.com to see Jeff's boxing video.  What the...  Reboxing.  Reboxing.  You're reboxing.  You're not unboxing.  You're sending back the iPod.  Is this the usual reboxing of an Apple product?  Oh, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm taking my iPad back to the store.  It's not really out of dogma, though I do share some of Cory Doctorow's fears about the closed world that Steve Jobs is creating.  Nor is it out of the product's limitations that I've complained about on my blog.  It's going to get multitasking and other things.  It's really just because I don't see a need for it.  It's solving a problem that I don't think exists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He says, by the way, sitting in front of a desktop and a laptop computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually just a screen on my laptop.  Oh, that's the laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then of course you have in your pocket, I don't know what, a Nexus One.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I have my iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And an iPhone.  And I have my Apple Ops.  You're device rich.  You probably don't need...  Oh, I am.  I am.  You probably don't need anything more.  No.  This is disconcerting.  That's what my wife says.  To dissolve from Jeff to Jeff is very odd.  I don't know which I should watch.  So do you actually box it up in this video?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I've got a bigger, better TV right across there.  Why watch it here?  Is it Laptop Junior?  Well, no, without that USB port especially.  I can't do work on it.  Is it my iPhone on steroids?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, Jeff's wearing exactly the same outfit.  So that's what's really scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I just don't see...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could lip sync this, Jeff.  Just move your lips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'm taking it back.  Wow.  Here's the re-boxing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just love this.  I love the look.  I love the look back at the camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you play this backwards, it would look like an unboxing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Except I'd be more excited.  This is my favorite part.  Get rid of those, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's cleaning the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there it is.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  My iPad is re-boxed and ready to go back.  I'll pay a $50 restocking fee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I'll consider that my early adopters tax.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's great, Jeff.  You're taking a stand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Apple fanboys are already attacking me on Twitter and YouTube  before I even tweeted it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People take this stuff so seriously.  I think you're crazy.  But it's your craziness.  It doesn't hurt my feelings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll confess now.  Either day could happen that there are some magnificent apps that come out  that make me have to buy it back again.  And I'll do it and I'll admit it and be open about it.  I don't see a use.  I'm just trying to make Gina feel good.  Yeah, you guys, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm with Jeff, though.  If there are some killer, crazy iPad apps that I can't live without,  I'll buy one.  Sure.  It's less about politics.  I'm not necessarily waiting for the Android Pad.  Although that may be the case.  I think Android...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, at first I thought Android would not work very well with this.  And the more I think about it, I think an Android version of this  would be pretty compelling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm going to get my hands on the WePad in Germany next week.  And that's Android-based?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's Android-based.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Two USBs, camera, and similar size.  I think six hours battery versus 10 hours battery is what they say.  They're announcing it formally on the 12th.  And I'll have to give my speech in Berlin on the 13th.  And I hope to have one in my hands.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd love to hear what you think.  I have a feeling we're going to have the same thing happen that happened  with the iPhone, which is three years of iPad killers that are, you know,  death warmed over.  But we'll see.  The Juju has been very disappointing to people.  I think there's a reason not to have a file system, a camera,  and a lot of complexity.  Personally.  I got one for my 80-year-old father-in-law.  I think I'm going to give this one to my wife when my 3G comes.  And she's a perfect example of somebody who has a notebook.  But when she minimized email and saw the desktop, she said,  what's that?  And what are all those little pictures on there?  I said, honey, those are icons of files you've saved to the desktop.  What's the desktop?  She didn't know and didn't need to know.  She didn't need a file system.  You know, she just wanted the data to be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I tried to get my wife to use the iPad just so I could have an excuse to keep it.  And she would go nowhere near it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't unbox.  You can't rebox something you're keeping.  So that's good.  We wouldn't have had a reboxing.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Doesn't iPhone 4.0 involve folders and desktop wallpapers and that kind of thing?  It does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which I think means that Google pushed them in a few ways,  which was useful for the marketplace.  It pushed them to multitasking of a sort, though it's a weird kind of multitasking,  and pushed them to folders and organizations, small things.  But I think competition is, God bless America, a wonderful thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's very clear that a lot of, almost all of what Apple did,  at least the seven tent poles Steve Jobs talked about in iPhone 4.0,  all of them were in response to either Google or Amazon.  They're doing this iAd, which is basically ad mobs, right?  They're going to do their own ad network.  They're going to do multitasking.  I'm not convinced that either multitasking or folders are a good idea.  I think there is a lot to be said for a very simple platform in terms of ease of use.  And I think one of the problems Microsoft's had with its phones is that it's Windows.  Or it's tablets, that they're Windows.  You can't shrink down a desktop operating system and expect it to work well.  So we'll see. We'll see.  Time will tell.  In the words of the bad local TV news reporter, only time will tell.  What is the other big... I'm looking through all of our stories here.  We've got a ton of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nothing huge this week, I would say, but lots of little stuff.  I think Apple and ads is worth another second.  Let's talk about that. Yeah.  I've tried two shows now to get a conversation going on about this, and I've failed each time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Try one more time. Third time's a charm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The shift from a browser-based, web-based architecture of the net to an app-based architecture of the net,  I still have concerns about it. I think that it closes things in.  And content companies think they're an application when they're not, but they're closing things in.  And it cuts off search and discovery through search and discovery other ways.  To get access to whatever is in this app, you've got to download and install an app.  And that just, I think, balkanizes the web.  Well, Apple's doing the same thing to an extent with iAds, because the ads will appear inside the apps.  You will not click out. There will be app-like experiences in the apps.  And that's probably a good thing for the advertising.  But the bigger thing I see happening here is... I should have seen this before.  I have all people who should have seen this before, but it really is a frontal attack on Google.  With the control freak and the control addicts of jobs and media and advertising all in line,  they don't want to be discovered by search. They wish they weren't discovered by search.  They don't know what to do with people who come through search.  And so they still think in a brand-centered world where you come to them and install their thing,  buy their thing, stay in their world, and that's what this is.  And maybe it is a big attack on Google. Maybe Google could lose a lot here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. I'm not sure it's such a global thing.  I think Apple wants to support developers.  Developers say to Apple, we want to do free apps, but in order for us to do free apps,  we want to be able to play ads in the apps.  Apple doesn't want to leave that money on the table.  AdMobz, the company Google bought, really was created to put ads in iPhone apps.  So Apple's just saying, well, why should we let Google have that revenue?  Why don't we create it? And here's where Apple has the upper hand.  They've got the ecosystem for app developers for distribution.  If you add the third part, iAds, in, I think most developers just could say,  well, it all kind of goes together and it's a push of a button. Why not?  They also, by the way, announced a kind of a competitive Xbox Live or PlayStation Live,  a social gaming community. And I think it's the same thing.  It's not so much they want to disable these other companies,  it's just they don't want to leave the money on the table.  Same reason Twitter bought Tweety.  Actually, that to me is more of an example of what you were talking about, Jeff.  Because they're not going to charge for Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think Louis LeGour from Seismic was growling in Twitter or trying not to growl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Fred Davis kind of warned everybody a week ago.  Fred Davis, the venture capitalist, one of the early...  Fred Wilson.  Fred Wilson, I'm sorry. Fred Davis, an old friend of mine.  ABC.com, yeah.  An early investor in Twitter warned everybody.  He said, you know, don't start making money building stuff that Twitter could build.  Obviously, he knew what was coming because Twitter goes out and buys the,  probably the premier third party tweeting application and sends a signal to anybody  who's making a third party business on Twitter that maybe this isn't a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But right, I mean, and the way Jake, young son Jake explained it to me was that basically  if people search for Twitter on iTunes, they don't get Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's what it's about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I get that. But isn't it a terrible signal to developers, Gina, that whereas Facebook did the opposite,  Facebook killed its own applications like courses, which Jake rewrote then,  in the belief developers would do a better job and do encourage development,  now Twitter is doing precisely the opposite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I don't have a problem with them buying Tweety.  I think it makes a lot of sense for them as a business that people would search for the word Twitter  in the app store and get an app from them.  You know, I think the reality is that developers are going to work on applications  that do things that Twitter proper doesn't.  And I mean, sure, I mean, I think the expectation is that you build something that does something really cool,  the company is going to use it.  So Google this week released nested labels in Gmail as a labs feature.  Finally.  Yeah, which is which is fantastic.  But you know, there's a user script with Grease Monkey user script developer,  a REND VR, I'll just going to say VR because I'll massacre his last name otherwise,  who wrote this Grease Monkey user script folders for Gmail like two years ago.  And I've had it, excuse me, in my better Gmail Firefox extension for like two years now.  And it's one of the one of the one of the best features.  So Manu, I think that's how you pronounce his name,  who's the Google engineer who wrote the post came to me last August and said,  What do you think should be in Gmail labs?  And I said, Well, obviously folders for Gmail should be in it.  And now it is.  And so I mean, you could take that as kind of an affront to the developer like,  oh, you know, this, you know, Google just copied what this, you know, great developer did that, you know,  that users found really useful.  I see it as like, first of all, it's an honor, I think, for REND,  because, you know, what he what he wrote was was valuable enough for them to use.  And I also see it as a challenge to make more innovative things as a third party developer.  I don't I don't really have a problem with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think this is a little different, though, because for well, for one thing, Twitter,  you could totally ascribe all of Twitter's success because there are a lot of Twitter clones to its API  and the and the very quick adoption from third party developers.  Definitely. And the amazing variety that they created.  Some of these developers are making Twitter clients that they charge for.  Tweety was $299. If Twitter gives away one of the best clients for free,  don't you think that's kind of a little up yours to all of these third party developers  who put Twitter on the map in the first place?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It raises the bar. It raises the bar.  Your app has to do something better than Tweety does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But Tweety is going to have access to the APIs.  Well, this is this will be very interesting to watch.  You know, this is historically an issue with the operating systems.  If the if Microsoft, for instance, uses secret API calls that they don't document,  they tell others not to use to give their software an edge.  That's really anti-competitive. In fact, they can get in trouble for it.  It would be very interesting to see if Twitter gives Tweety access to information and data, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That other developers don't have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Twitter has a history of this, by the way.  Twitter's fire hose, which is the single most valuable thing Twitter has, which is all the updates.  It's very selective about who gets it.  And many people have asked for it legitimately.  We're not are not allowed to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I went to a conference called Foursquare, not related to Foursquare, where Foursquare appeared a few months ago.  It's run by a big quadrangle, a big big equity company in New York.  And the investment guy was sitting there with Reid Hoffman of LinkedIn,  Buzz, BizStone of Twitter and I think Chad Hurley.  And a subtle moment for me was when he asked them,  Well, what company would you want to do a big distribution deal with?  They looked at him like they were confused dogs.  Why would we do that?  And they all said,  They don't get it.  Well, we have our people distribute us.  And Biz was eloquent about how Twitter has become Twitter through its API and through the developers who've done it.  That's obvious.  And listen, they bought a search engine.  They bought it from BetaWorks early on because it was a function they didn't have and they just truly, absolutely needed.  And so, you know, in that sense, I agree with Gina.  I understand the need for the core company to have something.  But I do think that they could be hurting themselves with their key distributors, which is developers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, watch closely because if they do anything else along those lines, then that may end.  And Fred kind of implied they might.  He basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So why would you invest?  So there are there are adventure funds to work on apps for Facebook and iPad and iPod.  And as far as I know, Twitter, what happens to the security of that investment?  I think the other question I want to ask Fred is, OK, now if a company came to you making Twitter apps, knowing what you know, would you ever invest in them?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you're the developer, Gina.  I mean, it's really you that this this comes down to.  If if you were a developer of a third party tweet app, say TweetDeck or Loic Seismic,  would you feel would would this discourage you from further development?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Initially, it would make me sad and feel discouraged initially.  But but if you think it through, the fact is that if if users who don't know the name Seismic and TweetDeck and these casual users are able to find a Twitter app in the app store and get on Twitter using Tweety.  I mean, that just means more people are going to use Twitter.  And it also, like I said, sets the bar.  Tweety is a great app.  Your app just has to do something a little better.  If it means that more people are going to be using Twitter mobile and that they're going to say, this is great, but I wish that I had an app that did this other thing, then that's what you have to shoot for.  And and so yeah, initially I'd be discouraged.  But but really, I think it just it just makes a lot of sense.  It makes a lot of sense for Twitter as a business to offer to users.  I'm just I amming with Anil.  And he made a great point, which is like Twitter's audience is users.  It's not it's not developers.  I think this is a good thing for users.  And I think that's a good thing, a good thing for developers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I think that's really that's really the important point.  And also not to go back to Apple, but but I've been trying to ask myself whether the decisions, the jobs at all have made these last few weeks have really been for users or just control freakishness for business.  It's keeping flash off this platform.  A good thing.  You know, that's that's, you know, not to be Google fanboy, but that's what they say.  Their first consideration is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can make an argument.  And this is Apple smart enough to make sure this is the case.  In every case, you can make an argument that it's for the user, whether it is or not.  I don't know. It may just be a happy coincidence that what's good for the user is good for Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, listen, I'm a developer who's working on a Twitter project that threads your replies, you know, according to status.  That is a that is a feature that Twitter could launch any day.  They have the data. In fact, they promised it, you know, in some of the API docs, they've they've made the they've said that they may do that at some point.  You may be to click on a status and see all the replies directly related to that status.  That's what my app does.  Would I be bummed if they launched that and kind of obviated the need for my app a little bit at first?  But then I would say, OK, what can I do even better than they do by default?  Fred. And that's what every developer has to be doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fred Wilson in his blog.  I think if you're a Twitter developer, you read Fred carefully right now, because Fred is basically whether whether intentionally or not becoming the lighthouse, the beacon for.  Well, where do you go now?  And he wrote a recent post, very interesting post, he says the Twitter platform's inflection point in which he really likens Twitter to an operating system, to a platform like the Macintosh or like windows.  What do you invest in, Fred? Yeah.  Yeah. And he says if you know, it's clear if you can build large businesses on top of a social platform like Twitter, because Twitter is so open and lightweight.  And here's where you want to italicize.  If you're a developer, I'm surprised there aren't more new kinds of killer apps.  Here are some places where I might think we'd see these killer apps emerge.  I think Twitter is using Fred or maybe Fred's using Fred to send a message.  OK, well, don't write a desktop client, but you might want to write this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to be a chirp this week, so I'm going to talk to quite a few developers, I hope, and I'll be interested to hear what they think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the question is, do you do you trust Twitter now?  I mean, what's to stop them as soon as you create a social?  He's talked about social gaming, which, by the way, sucks on Twitter.  Nobody wants you to announce how many people you've killed an imob on Twitter.  Please, please.  War mayors.  I was recently made a super mayor on Foursquare.  I better take that tweet away.  Verticals like stock twits and flicks up enterprise and discovery.  I think discovery is obviously a very interesting thing.  But remember, Twitter bought the search tool and analytics.  And I think Twitter is in all of these spaces a little bit, or not in all of them, but last two for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got to push for it because some a few months ago when I complained about something that Twitter didn't do in terms of being able to put.  I think we talked about the show early on the hashtags together in new ways.  And Fred kind of slapped me around and said, that's what the developers are for.  Jeff, that's what the outside developers will do.  That's how this works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then if it's good, we'll take it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but we'll take one of them and everybody else gets flicked off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, one of you wins.  Now, maybe that's not a bad thing.  A lot of people build apps to get bought by Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, that's life.  I mean, right.  I mean, you know, there's always a group of people doing something and then there's like the one chosen one who out of luck or circumstance or knowing the right person, you know, gets.  I mean, that's kind of, I don't know.  That's kind of the reality.  Well, that's why I asked you because you're a developer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so you're saying as a developer, it's it's understood.  Yeah, it's understood.  I take it as a challenge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I take it as a personal challenge to do it better than the thing that they bought or built in.  Yeah, personally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, except you wouldn't, I think, build an iPhone app now because the chances of getting discovery and traffic reduced markedly.  You know, hell you'd build an iPhone app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of course you'd build an iPhone.  Well, you build an iPad app as well.  But don't you think you'd want to?  I don't think the gold rush for iPhone apps has died out at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, for no, I mean, for Twitter, for Twitter, for Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sorry.  I misunderstood.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I build an analytics app for Twitter.  I mean, I would do a different kind of app.  I wouldn't do just a regular client app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I still think, as my friend Steve Gilmore has always said, that search and tracking are the key uses of Twitter.  You've got this huge database of information that is not well mined.  I mean, that's what you do.  That's what your application does, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That is what I'm working on.  And in fact, I have a little plug for this week.  The Twitter project that I work on called Think Tank is going into action this week.  Everyone who's listening at Twig right now, please who's on Twitter, go on Twitter and follow White House at White House.  White House is going to put out a question this week about the nation's technological and scientific priorities, what they should be.  And if you reply to those questions on Twitter, my app is going to collate those replies and the White House is going to listen to you.  Basically, the White House is going to be watching and listening and keeping track of what people reply using my app.  So I hope everyone will follow White House right now.  And then in the next few days, Monday through Wednesday, there will be a question put out.  And if you reply to that question, I hope you break my database.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You got 1.7 million people who could respond to this.  So that's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, yes, we do.  Yes, we do.  I'm a little nervous.  I have to tell you, it's a pretty surreal feeling knowing that something that you started as a hobby is being used by the White House.  It's a little, I haven't gotten very much sleep last couple of nights.  How exciting, Gina.  This is so cool.  Yeah, it's really, really exciting.  So yeah, just kind of an example of something that you can do that Twitter doesn't do right now.  I mean, hey, but like I said, Twitter could launch threaded replies pretty easily any day now.  And I accept that, but my app does more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I also think that if I put myself in Ev and Biz's shoes, they actually played this pretty well.  So they created this really trivial idea, which is kind of group text messaging, I guess.  Right.  And with follows.  And who knew where it was going to go?  I don't think anybody knew it was going to go where it went.  But it became thanks to their very open API and the enthusiasm of third party developers, it became this great value and a huge growth, a valuable database of information.  And now the real fun and interesting thing to think about is how you can use this information.  And it seems to me that even if Twitter got very active in creating answers to that question, there's plenty more.  There is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The possibilities are endless.  They are endless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And only get better as the data gets richer and it's growing astronomically.  And what's very interesting is it's growing globally faster now than it is in the U.S.  So it's really I've really thought of this for the last year or so as as as analog to an Internet nervous system.  It really is.  It's it's all these connections.  And the more that you just as the brain is is is good because it's nonlinear, it's heavily parallel.  Twitter is like that.  It's these very rich interconnections that are much more than linear.  And there's so much information in there because of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So should you know, should Google have done buzz ever at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, yes, I wish they do it better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely. I think. Yeah.  I mean, I think buzz brings brings value to the table, too.  I mean, some people really love I mean, some people really love buzz and use it a lot.  I mean, I think it's I don't think that we want to have one single place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know why I'm glad they did buzz and I wish buzz were doing better is because Twitter is a silo.  Ultimately, even if they've got APIs and they encourage third party developers, acquiring Tweety just underscores the fact that  ultimately it is a single company and who controls the data as much or as little as they want.  Whereas if you have and Google could be the same, but what they did has open is open standards open.  It's federational, federal and could in theory and I hope it will in practice become something that is much bigger than any one company becomes in fact a standard.  That's what we want. Right. We want dial tone.  That's exactly right. So Twitter could never be quick.  Twitter wants to be the dial tone, but it's one company.  I don't want one company to control the Internet dial tone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely agree. Couldn't agree more. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if it's going to be the Internet nervous system, it's got to be in many hands.  It's got to be open to anybody who wants to play and you should.  And then if Twitter comes along and then if somebody but Google comes along and says, well, we anoint this as the definitive third party.  A buzzing tool.  In fact, Google did create a buzz widget.  It doesn't matter because that's just one view into a much larger universe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Have they announced that Buzz will become federated?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Federation was in theory part of the was part of the original thought.  Yeah, it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay. I knew I knew it wasn't wave.  I wasn't sure that Buzz that was true.  No, no, I believe it is the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, correct me if I'm wrong.  And we have a lot of very smart listeners who are paying attention to this.  But it's my understanding that while they you know, the API is very scant and they haven't even given enough enough information to write a third party app yet.  But that is that that because of salmon, because because of the various different, you know, rest and so forth, APIs that they plan to implement or will implement, you could write a buzz clone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's fantastic. That's huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That would interoperate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's part of the thing about wave that I love the fact that it's federated and that you don't necessarily ever have to go through Google servers to communicate using it.  That's huge.  Yeah, huge, huge, very important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Otherwise, it's a it's a it's it's, you know, one company and we've learned something.  Yeah, we I hope we look back on the 90s in a couple of decades as the the stupid time when there were two operating system companies and that you had to choose.  And that's dumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you love that things sort of come full circle.  Remember back in the day when there was like a mainframe computer and that was your one central point of failure.  And then, you know, the web and now and now we're kind of back to this point where we have these these cloud services, which are becoming the central point of failure and contact.  Yeah, we need to go back to that peer to peer data sharing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And to by the way, but somebody saying buzz is Google only.  That's true.  They're not going to have a buzz server that I could run as you could have a wave server that you could run.  OK, but the but the standards are there so that I could have a server that would interoperate as a peer with buzz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's what to me is federation.  I don't have to use the buzz server.  In fact, it's better than I don't have to use a bus or but I can use industry standard APIs.  To communicate as a peer with buzz.  OK, right.  OK, yes, I see what you mean.  And you know, one would hope that would happen with Twitter as well at some point.  But see, this is where the Twitter company is not exactly as open as I'd like.  They don't give you the fire hose.  They don't give you have limited API calls.  If you're Facebook, you know, you know, Facebook won't let you store the data for longer than 24 hours.  All these these companies are really nervous about letting go of their jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not to go back to him, but he's he's, you know, well, this gets back to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think jobs is any more is much more close than any of these.  I mean, you do have a full browser on here and you've got WebKit and the you know, OK, iPhone 4.0.  They announced you can't develop with anything but Apple tools, which I'm sure is developers up in arms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They are up in arms.  Yeah.  And adapting from Flash is verboten.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And and, you know, certainly it's it's in Apple's business interest.  They've decided that they don't want Flash and they're going to kill Flash.  But it's also for a user's point of view, because as everybody knows, these kind of, you know, these these  phony APIs or phony interfaces are never quite as good as the native interface.  You know, the Java swing is never quite as good as the native interface.  And that's basically what Apple's saying is, no, you got to use the native interface from us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Eric Schoenfeld wrote a piece of TechCrunch this week that is on it's on the feed.  Is Steve Jobs ignoring history or trying to rewrite it?  And he's arguing that that he sees ghosts of the 90s in in this effort that in this world now,  Google is Microsoft getting its operating system various stripes out everywhere.  And Apple is doing its quality shtick and controlling mightily and asking whether he's limiting himself too much again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been thinking about this a little bit because, you know, Apple did not believe in apps.  I don't think I think when the iPhone came out, remember, there was only web applications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  As Jake said to me this morning, remember that it was a really dull fall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was horrible. And everybody wanted apps.  And I think Apple is, you know, this it happens again and again in the industry.  Apple didn't know that apps was going to be the next big thing and just said, OK, well, we'll let you have apps.  And suddenly it's the next big thing. And so now they're capitalizing on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, Apple believes in whatever it offers at the time.  They didn't believe in copy and paste for a long time. Exactly.  I mean, let's, you know, let's be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but I'm not. But I'm saying you can't give them credit that they they knew about apps, they planned apps,  and then they came along and it just took a little while. I don't think so.  I think they didn't believe in apps. I think that they just as, you know,  Palm kind of wanted to push web apps as well.  And and and frankly, that's the open.  Isn't that the open thing that you were just talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the irony is the apps are what give him the control that he wants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But nobody. But but this is my point.  If all Steve Jobs wanted was control, he wouldn't be pushing web apps.  He would have pushed apps from day one.  He didn't know apps are going to take off.  He thought it was going to be web apps. The open standard.  He believed in the Google way. He supported the open web.  And this is why the market is very interesting.  The market doesn't have this political agenda that you and I we do.  It doesn't know open from not open.  It just uses what it likes. Happens to like apps.  So I don't know if you blame Steve Jobs for this.  Steve Jobs just goes, oh, you want apps? Great. Good for us.  We'll take 30 percent everything.  But I don't know if he planned that. I don't think he did.  I think he did. And boy, you can if again, we look back at the last few years in 10 years from now, we're going to say, what was the big development apps?  Or maybe not. Maybe we'll look back and say, God, wasn't that awful?  How do we go to like with CD-ROMs? How do we go down that road?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's that's what I'm trying to figure out the right way to ask the question.  Oh, yeah, I just I sense something bigger here in this whole app thing that is an architectural shift in the web.  Just as I was arguing that we're moving past a page based site based web and things get distributed in streams and flows.  The app movement is precisely 180 degrees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree with you. But would you disagree that this is what the market has asked for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In those devices? No, I absolutely agree.  So who do you blame? You blame Steve or the market?  I don't know that I blame anyone.  I just want to see what the implications are and figure out what both the opportunities and risks are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not too worried because, look, I don't think the open web is going to go away because everybody likes apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't either. I mean, there's room for both. Right. We want both.  I mean, I mean, the issue the issue that I have with the the clout, you know, the issue that I have is I can't navigate to a web page or a market and download an app that a developer has posted without Apple getting involved in the middle.  That's the issue. It's not really.  You're not against apps. I'm not against apps. No, I'm against the fact that I can't install whatever I want on my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the problem. That's one, Gina.  The other one is that inside that app is information and data that you can't get to that you can't search via Google.  You can't link to. Right. That's that's trapped in that app.  And that's in the interest of the app maker, it would seem.  But but if you think in a distributed web at the same time, you want to expose that data.  And how do you do that? So to defend maybe that's Google's failing that Google hasn't hasn't been searching the guts of apps for the last two years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But these are all abstractions that we're aware of, but that the end user couldn't care less about.  And I think one of the things that's going to appeal to end users about the iPad is they don't have to think about where their data is.  It's not it's not an issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But look at this with Leo. If I leave all my restaurant reviews and all my restaurant data and everything else in Foursquare versus Yelp.  In Yelp, I can become the new restaurant critic of the world in Foursquare, as I understand it.  I don't think it can be discoverable. Right. Right.  That's that's the kind of issue. So that so there's an implication of my actions.  I'm well, that's my effort into something into a space where I don't know what's necessarily going to mean to me and my value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So so again, I'm playing the pure pragmatist and not and not the not an intellectual purist here at all.  And I'm a completely Gina's role today. Well, I'm completely agree with you with with all you know, I agree with you about all this.  But from a purely pragmatic point of view, then it doesn't eventually doesn't the market force Foursquare to open this up because really the value of Foursquare is the network effect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hope so. And I think more to the point for not the market forces it, but Foursquare is the first to see the opportunity.  That's where the value is. That's where the value is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So ultimately, ultimately, as long as there's value in openness and you get the network effect, as long as there's value in federation,  Twitter is going to get moved towards federation. Unless they unless they have this monopolistic Rupert Murdoch, we got to play the Rupert Murdoch clip.  This monopolistic Rupert Murdoch attitude towards the world.  The trend is our friend. Is it not?  So in a way, maybe this is just the natural ecosystem.  You get a individual, an entrepreneur who's going to it's like the patent system you get for 16 years, you get to benefit.  But then eventually it's got to open because it can't grow beyond a certain point as long as one company is doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. So if you're Google, shouldn't Google have been seeing this coming more and trying to push app makers to say here's a standard by which you can make your app stuff discoverable and we can search it, we can do this and that.  They've been doing that with content companies, media companies, but not with these app makers that are the future media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The irony to me is, if I'm Google, I sit back and say, don't worry, they'll come around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe. Yes. Okay, fine. Because you're Google.  But that's part of what I'm saying is maybe Google's not Google anymore in this shift of the world.  Maybe Google does lose the path to stuff you'll hear Rupert Murdoch in a second.  You heard Steve Jobs more than anyone saying, search. People are just searching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know. It was so funny that he said that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Google came back and argued, well, yes, here's our numbers. Yes, they do.  And what's search? You know, is search Google goggles and all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to say, I think Google's getting a little into the weeds.  And by, for instance, they've made a big mistake by becoming so attached to the Nexus One and the Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think there's a risk for Google here. Here I am, Google fanboys saying, watch out, Google.  I think there's something going on here that's bigger than they necessarily see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They said the right thing when they said, oh, all we care about is you use the Internet more and we benefit.  If they would just stay there and say, we're just going to keep doing things that make you use the Internet more.  I think their model is great. As soon as they get in the weeds and say, yeah, but we really want to win the app war.  It's like, no, no, that's a mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because they're in there. They're in channel conflict with the whole web.  Yes. To me, the interesting thing is what media companies have done versus tech companies.  Media companies, content is not an application.  The only reason to do an application like Tang magazine is to put a wall around your content.  I agree. If you don't do anything more, it is not a frigging application, people. It's just a page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute. Now, play devil's advocate.  Popular Science did this great app and maybe they didn't do anything you couldn't do with HTML5.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually found it to be a bit bothersome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't even figure out how to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, I said I couldn't.  What? I heard the bomb sign.  It was C.E. Wongland, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay. It's kind of no UI.  Yeah.  It's like, what do I do?  And this is actually, if I would say there's a problem with the iPad, that's the problem.  Is that the UI is not particularly discoverable.  You got to keep swiping and doing things until something happens.  This sounds familiar.  That's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This sounds familiar.  You know what? I deleted the pop site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, you're right, Jen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think I deleted the pop site app because I got so frustrated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The dichotomy that we're talking about is Chrome OS versus Android, right?  Chrome OS is just web apps.  What's that, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I need help with that.  So when you talk about Chrome OS and Google seeing a web app-based world,  is that different from what Apple sees in essence?  I think it is different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I think that Google doesn't know what the answer is.  And I think that because Google has Android, which is apps plus a browser,  and they have also Chrome OS, which is just a netbook operating system, right,  that just accesses web apps,  but they're trying to figure out the answer to the question themselves.  I mean, don't you think that Chrome OS is going to look positively anemic  next to the iPad operating system?  I mean, it's like it's links to web apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what it is.  I installed Hexa's Chromium thing, and it's like, well, this is just a browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a browser, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where else? Where's the rest of it?  You know, I'm shaking.  So stay there for a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Then what we're saying here is that we're shifting.  Be granted, they'll both be around.  But in terms of where the sex is and where the attention is  and where the money is thought to be,  people think it's suddenly they're following the shiny object of the apps  rather than the browser.  And the browser was the standard that tied all information together  through a simple address and link.  And we're now losing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, by the way, there are apps that should be apps.  There are plenty of apps where you're not, you know, you're playing a game  or you're not creating data or you don't need to be searchable.  There are plenty of places for apps to exist.  So let's say that that's not what we're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or functions like writing your text.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But we're talking about content encapsulated in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. And that's the funny thing about this is that you look at brands like,  you know, Foursquare to Bank of America have made apps for Android,  but the New York Times and the Guardian haven't.  And I think that, you know, Android has a much bigger audience now than iPad,  but they followed the shiny view to saying, well, what apps really mean is control for content.  And so I guess I'm concerned not about apps as apps, apps, you know,  making me a good, cute word processor or maps or things like that.  God bless. Bravo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I guess that was my question is, I guess I shouldn't have mentioned  the popular science app, but what if you could do it in an app better  than you could do on the web?  Wouldn't that be a compelling...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Show it to me, boss. Show it to me.  Yeah, maybe. I haven't seen it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I thought the Popsci app was it.  That was the one regret I had about the iPad was like not,  it was not having the Popsci because everyone seemed to love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've deleted it. I didn't realize I had it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The hilarious thing about the Wall Street Journal app is that they want to,  they now take the same exact content that I pay for on the web.  They put little keys over half of it saying, no, no, no, you can have that.  You have to pay us double now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, here's an example. This is a free app called Big Oven.  Epicurious has one as well. It's a recipe app.  So I'm not sure it's any different than having,  I mean, you could have done all of this in a browser.  I don't think it's any different than a browser.  Back in the day, I helped create Epicurious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, wow. Nice. Thank you. I love Epicurious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't Epicurious great?  Yeah. Add two tablespoons of olive oil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So really all you're adding here is a UI on top of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're trying to tart up content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're tarting it up. That's a very good way to put it.  What about the book that Jenny Jardin wrote up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was a medical book with like 3D objects that you could...  I don't know if it was a medical book or...  No, no. It was this. It's The Elements. Let me show you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This was originally a coffee table book.  Talk about tarting up content.  I mean, really all you have here is the periodic table of the elements.  But they've just crashed on me too.  I had a lot of that going on, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, a lot of quitting out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know if that needs a restart. Yes, he's doing it again.  Oh, don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It happens a lot.  Anil is iming me and he just said to me,  not a single person who has the Popsci app can name a story they read in it.  Right. It's pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They play with it. They don't actually read anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is the same thing. So this is Zinc, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And if I could go to the next page, which I apparently can't  because it has too many elements on it and it's crashing,  it gives you rotating versions of this.  There's an interface to Wolfram Alpha.  So it's looking up Zinc on Wolfram Alpha.  But this is $14 and it's a coffee table book put into an app.  And you know what? It's eye candy.  I don't think it's particularly useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's expensive to do.  And none of that is searchable.  If you want to say, hey, kids, this is the best damn Zinc page I've ever seen,  you can't link to it.  Right. You can't share it.  That's the tragedy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's not the tragedy for the elements  because then you can say pay $13.99 and you can see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there's plenty of other elements pages.  Maybe they don't rotate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes, exactly.  Zinc hasn't changed, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The content is not better on this.  It's tarting it up.  It's a perfect way to phrase that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I think what we see here is media companies think suddenly that they are software companies.  And all they really want is, hello, Rupert Murdoch, is they want a fence  because they think that returns them to their old control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, here's the good news, though, Jeff.  It ain't going to work.  It ain't going to work.  You know that and I know that.  We laugh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We mock these people.  But it's actually going to kill some media companies along the way.  I really believe that.  As Richard Gingras, the CEO of Salon, said, it is a fatal distraction.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's well put.  Which companies?  That's their problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm accused of dancing on their graves.  I'm actually not.  I'm wishing they wouldn't kill themselves.  But if they do, they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, really, if there's a message to what you're saying is don't do this because it's bad for you.  Ultimately, it's not bad for us because, frankly, it ain't going to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what I actually try to say to Mr. Murdock, but he'll never listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we're going to find out what Rupert...  Let me see it one more time.  I restarted the iPad.  One more time.  Let's see if it'll do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is what you get when you buy first generation kids.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was a memory issue.  So now it's working.  And if you look at Gina, even as developer, you got to appreciate this.  All of these spin independently.  What does that teach me?  Nothing.  It's just cool.  And watch, they even degrade independently.  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Cool.  It ended in 2000, Neilio.  It's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like a CD-ROM.  It's all it is.  It is a CD-ROM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That is the CD-ROM analogy.  I get it now.  That's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I resisted buying this, then Jenny finally talked me into buying it.  Okay, nice.  Great.  Wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But...  I want to scream, Jane, stop this crazy thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Interesting.  A lot more cynicism about the iPad this week.  No, no, don't you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You tried this out of my cold dead fingers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gina, can we get him...  After last week, I tried to get you to buy one.  I admit, we tried to get Leo to return his.  Hell no.  Hypnotize him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How quickly things change in seven days.  Oh, no, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't misunderstand me.  This thing, I hardly used anything else this week.  I didn't use my laptop, but twice.  And that was for the kinds of things like Expedia, where you go online and you want  to buy something.  And it's a little hard to do all that in here.  But for consumption of content, for gaming, even for browsing, for email, I find this  far superior.  I hardly used a desktop or a laptop at all this year.  This week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to ask you again in like six or seven weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, everybody says, oh, Leo, tire of it.  It's just another gadget.  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My son predicted that it would gather dust on the shelf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's an interesting thought.  There's certainly a lot of people thinking that.  And I have a feeling that it's going to go the other way.  We'll see.  We shall see.  We're going to listen to what Rupert said about Google and how wrong he got it in just  a little bit.  But let me pay some bills and then we'll continue on.  You're listening to This Week in Google with Gina Trapani from SmarterWear.org and Jeff  Jarvis of BuzzMachine.com.  And brought to you this week by Goat2Meeting.  Goat2Meeting, those friends at Citrix have done it again.  They're the kings of remote access.  They did the enterprise level remote access that Windows uses.  If you're in a business, you know what Citrix means.  That's a big name.  They do consumer grade stuff, too, that's really fast, easy, simple, works on Macs and PCs,  like Go to My PC and Go to Assist and Go to Meeting.  Go to Meeting eliminates the need for business travel.  I mean, who can afford to fly across the country for an hour meeting or drive across town for  half an hour?  With Go to Meeting, you get more done.  You meet over the phone, but it's still visual.  You can still see the PowerPoint presentation, the product demo.  You can still see the spreadsheets collaborate together on documents.  It brings any conference call up.  Much more exciting, much more engaging, and it gets a lot more done with a lot less travel.  And talk about affordable.  It's $49 a month for as many meetings as you want, as long as you want, and that includes free voice  over internet and phone teleconferencing.  Go to GoToMeeting.com slash twig, G-O-T-O, meeting.com slash T-W-I-G.  You could try this free for 30 days, no obligation.  Unlimited meetings for the next 30 days.  You know, I know when a company does this, that's the stand-alone of product.  How do they sell this product?  They say try it.  Try it free for 30 days.  We think you're going to find a lot of ways to use it.  I know we do.  We use it all the time at Twitter.  Go to Meeting.  And by the way, we pay for our account.  We have several that we pay for because it's so great.  Go to meeting.com slash T-W-I-G.  Thank you so much for your support of this week in Google Citrix.  Shall I play this?  Now, explain first of all, Jeff, what this cut comes from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Rupert Murdoch, who's been saying much of this at the same time, but I just found it amusing.  It sounds like the old tubes and pipes discussion from our former senator.  Senator Stevens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And he was in Washington doing a talk.  He's been out there preaching more recently.  And it was at, I think, George Washington University with a journalist.  And so I just found it amusing.  Maybe you won't, but I thought it was amusing hearing Rupert discover the Internet.  And by the way, let's remember here as we listen to this, Michael Wolfe, his biographer, said that his last knowledge,  Rupert had never touched a computer or used Google.  Well, now you'll hear that he touches the iPad if you consider that computer.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is this, by the way, is Matt Wells and it is the Guardian.  It's their Media Talk podcast.  And 15 minutes in on the April 9th episode, this is what you'll hear.  Google taking his journalism for free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're going to stop people like Google or Microsoft or whoever taking our stories for nothing.  He's stopping what exactly?  Well, if you go to Google News and you see stories and it says Wall Street Journal, you tap on it and you suddenly get the page or the story as in the Wall Street Journal.  And it's for free.  Right.  And they take it for nothing.  And then they've got this very clever business model, which is and they've invented almost a new type of advertising, search advertising.  And so if they just pour out tens of millions of words a day, one way or another, they have key words in there which tie to advertising beside it.  And it's produced a river of gold.  And I think they ought to stop it.  The newspapers ought to stand up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, so I hope they do stop it, Rupert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Back in the earliest days of the Internet, I held focus groups in Cleveland and we had people there who sat in there in the earliest days.  And they said, you know, there's this amazing company that's bought all the content you can imagine.  Encyclopedias and medical stuff and news and everything.  It just has everything.  It's called Netscape.  Oh, that's what he thinks.  That the Google is the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So when I go to the Google and I search for my journal and I see my journal and I click on it, there's the page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's my stuff.  It's free.  Yes, you're serving it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Your page.  He doesn't.  He clearly doesn't know.  He's sat down with him and probably they're scared of him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't want to be the one to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, Rupert, let me explain this.  We spend millions of dollars a year to put that page on the Internet.  And if Google didn't point to it, no one would find it.  See, they're coming to our site.  Rupert, that's us.  He clearly doesn't.  I mean, I don't understand what he's even saying.  No.  It's like, is he implying that Google's putting ads on the Wall Street Journal page?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He thinks that Google is creating tons of content today by doing this.  He just doesn't know what this Internet is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In all charitableness, I'm really trying to, because I assume he's an intelligent person, he's been very successful,  that I'm trying to understand, you know, presuming that he knows that he paid for that page,  I'm trying to understand what he might be thinking.  He's probably thinking, well, there'd be no value to Google at all if it couldn't link to people.  So the value that Google has, the billions of dollars that Google is worth, comes from the fact that they link to our content.  So does he want money from Google or does he want them not to do it anymore?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, right now he's saying he doesn't want them to do it anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, that's where he's kind of cuckoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because he could do it right now, but obviously smarter minds in his company are ignoring the boss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody, Martin Sassenberger, who's a listener in Germany, Germany for some reason has decided,  as we've talked about before, that they don't like the Google Street View.  And he sent me an obviously photoshopped street sign from Germany.  It has a town name and then a No Robots text below it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Did you ever see?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is the humor I like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't that good? It's a very geeky humor. If I can find it, I'll show you. It's very funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hold on. You've got to see this one. And this is another one.  Search for Google Home View on Google. It's in German. It doesn't matter. It's worth the laugh.  You'll go to an LA Times page first off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep, I see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then click on that video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, thank you Google for that search.  And the LA Times should be thanking Google for that search because now I'm seeing an LA Times page  with ads for Verizon, California, Lutheran, and the University, all of which is monetized by, not Google, by the LA Times.  Oh my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And by the way, folks out there, if you really want the translation, the LA Times now, thanks to crowdsourcing has it.  Here's the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google Home View.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hello. We're from Google Home View. We want to take pictures of your apartment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love it that the subtitles on this are in French.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have to take pictures of your apartment.  You're being photographed now. It's the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you translate. You speak German, too.  So, a living room.  Can we come in? Yes, I have a living room.  Living room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kitchen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A bedroom.  Kitchen.  There's the Google man writing it all down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the veranda.  Just forced around, just for the both of them, maybe.  Just for them to look a little bit alive.  Nobody knows that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So he's leading them through the house. There they are.  And it says, are you going through all of Germany? Every house? Yeah.  Every house in Germany, every piece of furniture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Then everyone can look at my house from the inside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  First from the outside, then from the inside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We get the outside and the inside.  Would you like to sit on the sofa, please?  That's what he's saying.  Taking pictures of them sitting on the sofa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a lot of people. We just got home from work.  Don't worry, we've seen some real pigstyes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  At least the bed's made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  While?  Photo?  Photo of the bedroom.  Photo of the bedroom.  You know, because of the data protection, it has to be partially pixelated.  We have to have this partially pixelated because of privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not fully.  Wait, wait until you see this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So he's pulling out of his briefcase some pixels.  These are pixel boards.  They're holding them in front of their eyes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You might as well refer to your eyes as a punch.  Now it's a new house here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're not taking pictures of us.  I have your car. I'll take a picture.  No, no, no photos.  Listen to us.  If I were to take pictures of you privately,  you would have to take pictures of us.  I have your car.  You don't take pictures of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's our pixel board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, you're taking pictures of all the other people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're taking pictures of us.  So if you don't play along, we'll Google you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the greatest one.  If you don't play along with us, we're going to discontinue your Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So she lets him in.  By the way, I have a feeling these people are real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, oh yeah. As far as I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they don't know.  I mean, the photographers, the Google people are fake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the whole joke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's obviously a TV show.  What I want to see is I want to see the home view map now on Google.  They didn't do the last step there. That would have been fun.  It's from the Heute Show.  That's very funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And people believed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, the Google Street View car was sabotaged in Germany a week ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they really don't like it, do they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, they don't. They go wacky on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Street View doesn't bother me. Does it? I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's public. What's public is public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  If you restrict Google from taking pictures of people doing things in public,  Right. Which many have tried to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  But it's not going to be in Germany.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, we were talking a little bit about HTML5.  And one of the remaining debates over HTML5 is what video codec to use.  And this is actually a fairly important debate for open source advocates  and people who want an open Internet because the two choices seem to come down to H.264,  which is a very popular codec.  In fact, if you're watching our stream, it's in H.264.  In some cases, wrapped by Flash and some cases not.  But it is an encumbered codec. It's proprietary. There are patents.  There's an alternative called AugTheora.  And I don't know if it's as good as H.264, but it is open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And not used as much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hardly at all, as far as I can tell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Firefox won't support anything but AugTheora, correct?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, apparently, and I'm reading, this is Google's open source blog,  google-opensource.blogspot.com.  Google's written a little, there's a little post here, kind of putting some weight behind AugTheora.  And Google has given a grant.  They're funding Theorarm, which is a free optimized for ARM version of Theor.  And of course, that would be important for a lot of portable devices, including the iPad.  Hoping to, I think, get Theorarm a little bit farther along down the line.  I would love to see Google throw its weight behind Theorarm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then maybe people would actually use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Interesting.  We'd support it. I mean, we're tied to the formats that our streaming providers offer.  It's been very interesting because ever since Apple deprecated Flash,  both Ustream and Justin.tv, two of our providers, have started offering unwrapped,  flash-free versions of the video, H.264, which streamed beautifully on the iPhone.  And if Android supported it, would stream nicely on Nexus One.  Does stream on the iPad.  And that's all happened just lately.  Apple really is doing some damage to Flash.  But I would love, now we would be thrilled if we had a Theora version of our stream.  But you know, that requires, we can't do it.  We don't have the resources to do it. That requires our providers doing it.  Moving along. YouTube's testing a new video player.  This is, I guess, part of their redesign.  A video player with more elegant controls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So say they?  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, the video I just played had those new controls.  I was a little puzzled by it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I noticed that. I was like, what is that?  What is that?  It's a different red thing than usual.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And they're dimmed down a little bit too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. It's a big deal.  When you search for a show like Seinfeld, it gives you the opportunity to get just episodes from each year.  But interestingly, you do not have the option to play there.  You must go off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hmm. Go off to like Hulu?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To whatever site the video's from. So it's merely a search engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's fun.  That's the open web, my friend.  That's good.  That's a good thing.  Sometimes I worry that Google gives some sort of precedence to YouTube video versus video stored on other sites.  And I don't know if it's the case or not, but I have to say it definitely prejudices us towards storing our stuff on YouTube.  It wasn't enough to get us to use Google video, however.  No.  It does help that there's a community there.  But that's a way that Google could perhaps skew things a little bit.  Anything else of interest before we get to our tips and tools?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I returned my Nexus One this week.  What?  I swapped it, actually. I didn't return it.  I was really sad. I looked down at my phone a couple of weeks ago and I saw these little specks of dust.  Oh, you know, the dust issue is starting to crop up.  Under the screen, yeah.  And I was so sad. I mean, I was just like crushed.  I was cradling the handset.  I was like rubbing it against my jeans.  Is it on the outside? No, it's in the inside.  But I called. I called Google support.  They connected me to HTC.  It's an unsealed. You know, the phone seal isn't correct.  Actually, Leo, you probably know more about this, but it's a production mistake.  They connected me to HTC and they said, okay, we're going to put a $530 hold on your credit card and send you a new phone without dust.  If you send your phone back to us within 10 days, we release the hold and we don't charge you.  They swapped it.  Yeah. And the other option was that I could send them my phone and then be phoneless for like two weeks while they sent me another phone.  So I opted for the hold because they're not going to charge me. I'm going to send it back.  But it was really, really simple. So if you've dust under your Nexus One screen.  What did it look like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because after I saw your post, I went, where is it? Is there dust? I don't know.  It's apparent? It's obvious?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. If you look really closely, there's just tiny little specs under the screen itself. I don't think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People have gotten complaints about that with the iPad as well. I think it's in the nature of capacitance screens and the glass on top of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When I open up the back of my Nexus One, it has tons of dust in it that I can't figure out how it got there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, weird.  Dust is everywhere.  It's specs that you can't rub off. It's specs that are obviously trapped underneath.  And apparently this is an iPhone thing too. You can return your iPhone if it happens to your iPhone and they'll swap it out for you. Apple will swap it as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this is good news because Google has been getting a lot of heat for their bad support for the Nexus One. Their Python based support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Python. Answer.py. Yeah, no, no. It was a live human who picked up the phone instantly and connecting me to HTC was really pretty painless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When I almost returned mine, I had the same experience that they were very responsive, very good at trying to convince me not to, which they should do, but not in an AOL way.  And so far, the only time I've tried to do anything, I didn't end up doing it that time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, they asked me how I like the phone. I mean, the great thing is you take out the battery, you take out the SIM card.  And I know when I boot up my new phone, which I have, I actually just haven't started yet. All my Android settings are stored in the cloud.  I'll sign in and everything will be just as it was. I'm not sure actually if apps, but certainly my wallpaper and contacts. It restores apps.  It restores apps and widgets. I'm very excited about that. So then I just drop the other one.  I'm going to sign out of the one with the dusty one and drop it in the box and I'm done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That reminds me, a question. So I did an interview this week for AARP Magazine. No cracks, please.  About the iPad. And the reporter said, you know, this is being talked about as grandma's computer, which I think insults grandma.  Grandma's been online for 15 years. But anyway, he said, don't you have to own a PC or a Mac to sync to iTunes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, it's a peripheral. It is a peripheral. It is. And the next is, Android in general.  I mean, listen, the iPhone and the iPad does a lot of things better than Android does. But the one thing that Android does very, very well is just this idea of like sign in once, all your stuff's on your device instantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no syncing. When I moved from the Droid to the Nexus One, I was shocked because it was instantly had my wallpaper, all the applications started downloading. It was amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One thing I will do is if I can get my hands on the Wepad and stick a SIM in and do it there, right? It should just sync it basically, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It should. It should. Yeah. If you sign in with the same Google account. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't that neat? Oh, God, now I got to remember which Google account I use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's another problem. Here's one kind of cool story, just kind of a last story. Google Earth helps unearth new human species in South Africa.  Paleoanthropologists, Professor Lee Berger at the University of Wittwassestrand in Johannesburg used Google Earth over the last two years to locate more than 500 previously undiscovered caves and fossil sites.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's really cool how I guess you can just see the indentations and things. This was a very well discovered, well explored area. Even so, they found Petri.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And a new human species, Australopithecus sediba, an upright walker that shared many physical traits with the earliest known species of the genus Homo.  Who should be known as Homo googolus. I hope they do. There's anything right in the world.  Wouldn't that be great? And they've added some new features to Google Earth. I think it's Google Earth Oceans, which I think is, you know, they added outer space and now they've added the outer space.  Now inner space, Google has added layers of information and annotations for all the oceans. So if you've got Google Earth, you can start to look and see more about the oceans.  Last year, I didn't know this, all the oceans were 3D mapped and video and photos were added for good measure. Now they're adding the information as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow. So like there are Google's ocean submarines equipped with cameras going out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Robots.txt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's some coral reefs that have a robots.txt file prohibiting entry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I envision Flipper with something on his head now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I represent Google Ocean. I think this is really great.  Really great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's pretty cool. That's really cool.  Homo googolus. That would make Homo's everywhere happy.  Hey baby, we're all homos.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  We are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're all homos.  Let's move on. Tip, tool and number, starting with Gina Trapani's tip of the week.  My tip this week is a shameless Android plug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is for folks who have been thinking about switching to Android but aren't sure whether or not they want to because they don't know what apps are available.  I had a listener write me an email saying, hey, you know, I've got this iPhone and my nine-year-old has just been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and we're going to use a smartphone to kind of keep records and keep on top of his illness.  And I'm thinking about switching to Android, but I don't know if Android has any diabetes related apps because I need a handset to actually search the market.  There are a few featured apps on the site, but no apps that you can't search the market on the web.  But you actually can.  There's a site called Double Twist.  Double Twist is a great media manager.  You can sync with an Android device.  I use it.  I love it.  Yeah, me too.  A little slow, but I like it.  If you go to apps.doubletwist.com it's a web front end to search the Android market.  So you can check out what apps are available.  I mean, you know, you basically get the information that you would get in a single site.  So you can check out what apps are available.  I mean, you know, you basically get the information that you would get if you are looking in the Android market reviews and ratings, but everything's there.  So if you're wondering if Android has an app similar to something you're running on the iPhone or some other system, you can search there.  So apps.doubletwist.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is really great.  Thanks to a DVD, John, because that's his company, Double Twist.  Oh, I didn't realize that.  Yeah, the guy who cracked CSS.  Thanks, DVD John.  Thanks, DVD John, once again.  Right on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's a pretty cool guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you search for Twitter.  There's 1,222 results for Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But none of them say the Twitter app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  None of them say the Twitter app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And we come full circle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually, wait, there is an entry that just says Twitter, but the bird is looking kind of janky.  Yeah, it's clearly not.  It's clearly not the official Twitter app.  And the first review was, what a piece of crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to say there's one thing that is true about the Android marketplace is they're not all great apps.  Yeah, yeah, that's true.  Let a million crappy apps bloom.  Right.  I don't think that is Jeff's number.  No, it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is.  It leads directly to the number, Leo.  Like you planned it this way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I kind of did.  Okay.  I think I knew what your number was.  I stayed away from it.  You were nice enough to stay away.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  More than 9,000 Android apps were added in March.  That's just sort of double the 5,500 in February.  So there's a nice big upswing here.  Actually, 9308 in March.  And the total, which is what I'm interested in, is the 42,000 downloadable apps.  That's 100,000 shy of Apple's 140,000.  And of course, some of the Android ones are crappy.  But there's growth here.  So if you go back to June of 2008, there were 6,000 apps.  That's surprising.  Finally, the numbers here, according to androlib.com, are that 59.6% of Android applications are  free versus 27% of iPhone applications are free.  Huh.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the thing, the number I don't have that I really want to have is what's the installed

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  base of the two OSes now?  Of customers.  That's a good question.  Yeah.  I can't find it anywhere.  So chat room, chat room.  Hello, chat room.  I can give you the number for the iPod Touch and the iPhone because Steve quoted it on

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thursday.  It was I think 85 million.  I doubt very much there's 85 million Android.  Yeah, Android's got a way to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can pretty much assure you it's not close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's great.  There are more Android apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, of course, you don't care about quantity as much as you care about quality, but I think  the quantity sort of leads to quality.  For apps to really start to distinguish themselves and get really good.  So those are great growth numbers.  That, by the way, is an issue if you're going to do an Android tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One of the things that's really succeeded on the iPad is these native iPad apps, which  are, I mean, it's a big difference between doubling an app and actually making an app  for this screen size.  And I don't know if you're going to see Android developers step up in the same way.  Yeah.  Yeah, it'll be interesting to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because with all that extra real estate, you really can do a lot more.  It makes a big difference.  I mean, when I look at what Zagat has done or Zillow has done, and these are free upgrades.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Most of them are not.  But it really makes a big difference.  I use TweetDeck.  I love TweetDeck on the desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I imagine on the iPad, it's excellent.  It's similar to the desktop.  They finally have the room for those columns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you have enough room to do more columns, right?  Yeah, it's very similar.  It looks exactly like the desktop app.  And then there's nothing wrong with that.  My tip of the week comes from our good friend Matt Cutts.  And it's a little trick using Google's URL shortener, goo.gl.  If you append .QR after the goo.gl URL, you do goo.gl.QR, you will get a QR code.  It will generate one of those QR codes.  It will generate one of those 2D barcodes, which is kind of wild.  Now, the real problem is how do you use Google's URL shortener?  And there are not many ways to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You have to know where the bookmarklet is or run the toolbar, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, if you use Chrome, there's a Chrome extension that does it.  Still, I think it's kind of cool.  Apparently, though, not so difficult to generate QR codes.  And in fact, there's a lot of different ways to do this.  Here's one from a reader added to my friend feed post or Matt's friend feed post.  Snapmyinfo.com slash QR will do the same thing.  In fact, you can take any arbitrary text and make a QR code, maximum of 512 characters.  Now is the time for all good homos to come to the aid of their country.  This would be good to just put this on your URL.  I wonder how fast it is.  So there you go, a QR code just for you.  And of course, you can scan that in with your Droid phone.  Would you use a particular app, either of you, for your Nexus One to read QR codes and other codes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've put one in there, but I've never had the opportunity to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Barcode scanner. Does it come with it? I think it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I think I install a barcode scanner.  I can't remember, but anyway, it's easy to get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can search Double Twist and find it.  Gina Trapani is the author of The Complete Guide to Google Wave.  Any new wave stuff going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's see, what was the last wave thing that happened?  Oh, just the April Fool's prank about the notifications.  Otherwise, not too much.  Although I get the feeling that they're gearing up to launch some wave-related stuff at Google I.O. next month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They are due.  We were talking before the show. You're going to Google I.O.  Are you going to go, Jeff, to Google I.O.?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nope. I'm a pretend. I'm fake. I can't develop crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll inquire, but I wonder if we could cover it in some way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that'd be great. I'll be there, so I'd be happy to help out with that.  Of course, I'd love to have you there in the flesh, Leo, but if you're not, I'd be happy to do some coverage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to look into that and see if we can bring our patented camera staff.  Ooh, that'd be awesome.  And go around and cover Google I.O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's going to be fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the folks at Ustream have said, anytime you want to borrow the live Ustreamer live view, we can do that.  The live staff. The streaming staff.  The magic staff. The Gandalf staff.  You can read the book and buy your very own copy online at CompleteWaveGuide.com.  And of course, Gina's blog is a must-read.  Put it in your newsreader if you don't want to go to the site every single day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Even when she's bored by the discussion of the iPad, she's fascinated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wow, I'm impressed. Your filters are good, Leo. I didn't think you'd catch that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I catch it all. I see everywhere.  SmarterWear.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And follow White House this week on Twitter and answer the question, what should we do when it comes out this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you have an opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you have an opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't just make up something.  That never stopped anybody online.  Yeah, I know.  What does it George Burns said, it's too bad all the people know how to run the country are driving cabs and cutting hair?  Jeff Jarvis is the man at BuzzMachine.com and the author of What Would Google Do?  And your new book is out. Are you writing it now? Are you working on it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I got one page in. I think I'm going to change.  The talk I'm giving in Germany, I'm thinking I'm trying to convince my editor that's the topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's re-boxing his book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I am.  So no more beta? Wait, I was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's still beta, yes.  It's still beta. Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love the name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love the name. I love the whole idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The beauty of the name is you can make it anything you want.  It's true.  That's the problem.  You can make it about Aquaria.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's just the problem. I'll see. I'm going to see if I get some plain time and some Google time.  I'm going to sit in the sauna and think in Germany.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. You'll catch Jeff at BuzzMachine.com and What Would Google Do? is the book, available on Amazon and everywhere else as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For those German listeners, I'll be speaking at Repubblica in Berlin on Wednesday about the German paradox  about publicness and privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Will you be back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll be back, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In time for next week's episode.  Yes.  Man, you must be exhausted.  That's a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Driving to Rochester and back last night was exhausting.
