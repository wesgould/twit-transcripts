Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This Week in Google, the show that covers Google and the cloud and joining us now from not quite the cloud, but the very snowy environs of Davos, Switzerland.  No, Davos is not the town.  It's, or is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the town.  Jeff Jarvis.  You're there because you're the world famous Jeff Jarvis host of This Week in Google, right?  That's right, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How could they have?  I won the lottery among the three of us, didn't I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And for those of you watching on video, Jeff hasn't gone native on us.  This is some sort of costume party going on.  He's got face paint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's South Africa night here.  See the little things here?  And so you could go downstairs and get your face painted.  Oh, that's cool.  And you're wearing a suit.  I did it for you guys.  I did it for you.  It's quite a look.  I wear a tie.  And here's the official badge.  It gets you into things at Davos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's awesome.  That's what they say here is Davos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Clay Shirky was at another event before this last year.  And he said, people come up to me and say, are you going to Davos?  He said, why are they asking me if I'm going to get divorced?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you're in Davos.  Davos.  Davos.  Is it part of the German speaking area?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a kind of German that sounds like nothing on earth to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sounds like Davos.  Also with us, Ms. Gina Tripani from SmarterWear.org and Lifehacker and CompleteWaveGuide.com.  Hi Gina.  Yes, sir.  So we're a little later on.  We'll go downstairs with Jeff to see what's going on at South Africa night.  Is every night a different night of the week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, this is the soiree at the end when we're supposed to dress in tuxedos or native dress.  I saw Michael Larrington earlier and he was in the Native American dress called blue jeans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's valid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Surprising.  That's typical of Mike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's not going either or.  He's going his own way.  I have to send him your regards.  Please do.  I've got to send him one of these stickers.  So while you were in Switzerland, you got to talk to Marissa Meyer, Eric Schmidt, Chad Hurley was there from YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And David Drummond and Nikesh Arora.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I managed to luck into it.  They had a briefing for a certain select press and I whined and asked to get into it and so I did.  They had us meet at a cafe up the street from here and then we walked to the safe house.  It's an apartment that they do up in Google stuff.  And so we talked to them there for about a little over an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And how forthcoming were they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think fairly forthcoming.  It was on the record, though I heard there was some discussion about whether it should have been, but it was.  They said clearly.  And I think some news came out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You wrote a blog post about it, but here's your chance to talk about it in a little bit more detail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, for the rest of the world, I think China was probably the bigger news.  But for our end of the world, I thought it was big news that they said that they are now going to consider being transparent about the splits on AdSense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So why is that an issue?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I was in a conference before this in Munich called DLD where the head of Borda, which is the largest magazine publisher in Germany,  complained to Dave Drummond, the chief counsel of Google on a panel that the Germans are really going after Google.  They're filing suits for the government.  They're trying to go after copyright.  There are all kinds of stuff.  They're just whining like crazy.  And he said, we want a fair share.  And so I asked a fair share of what?  You know, AdSense?  And he said, yes, we want transparency and a fair share.  Well, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't understand.  Oh, because we don't I guess they just pay you what they pay you and you don't know how much of the total revenue that is.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Drummond was saying things like there are some people that are up to 80 percent and there was catcalling from the audience.  You know, who's that?  And so I think that he must have come back.  And they're saying that they've been talking about this for a while.  But it was convenient that it came right after this German confrontation.  It's a bit of peace there.  So I told the German publisher then last night that this had happened.  And there were big smiles.  So the Germans and the and Google are trying to meet with each other and trying to find some level of peace.  But what happened here that's important is that at least this one German publisher put a fence around it because there's this belief by some that Google owes publishers some of their revenue all around because you have our content.  That's rather absurd.  And Drummond said, I don't owe you anything for a search where someone comes in and searches for a camera, goes to the store and buys it.  You had nothing to do with that.  And so that's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why should they get credit for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the publishers are kind of acting like you use our content thus.  And of course, we all know that's dumb, but they don't know it's dumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's completely reasonable to say.  But as as as a blog publisher, publishers, the two of you, you probably would agree that if they pay you a buck for somebody visiting your page, you'd like to know that's a buck out of how much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  I mean, the two big complaints I had about Google in my fanboy book were China and lack of transparency about AdSense.  So, you know, they just ticked off two of them, which is which is kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So do they have a time frame for when they might say this?  No, it was very vague.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was we're going to consider it, but you're not going to say we're going to consider it and then say, you know what?  We thought about it.  We considered it.  And the answer is no.  No, they're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I understand, you know, I mean, I understand how well they might not want to tell you what they're getting paid for that ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I have one AdSense in years and years.  So if you're a web publisher, you run AdSense on your blog, you log into your AdSense dashboard or whatever, and you find out how much Google is paying you.  Right.  But they don't. So it doesn't show you what percentage of what they get paid for advertisers.  That's the issue.  So how did this other person know that someone was getting 80 percent?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because Drummond said that some get up to 80 percent and some complained about that.  And then I saw Drummond here in Davos and he said, you know, haven't you heard of volume discount?  And so I think that to me, I was talking with the publisher today and I think that if Google releases this, it also creates motivation to try to move up the ladder of share.  You get more traffic, more relevance, better performance.  Maybe you'll get a higher share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, definitely. I mean, like that's how Amazon Associates works.  Like if you the more you can go into a program that's tiered, right, and the more that you sell with your associate ID, the higher percentage that you get.  But but but the Germans have a problem with the ads that Google shows on its results page itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that was the thing.  This publisher at Berta said AdSense and I'm not sure he knew what he was talking about.  But those are ad words, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the difference.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And but but I then saw a colleague of mine at the Guardian still complains that Google takes our content and scrapes our content and we deserve a share of what they do.  Well, no, because then Google would have to pay every website in the world.  And you're getting the value, as Eric Schmidt has said more than once now, we send you four billion clicks a month.  It's up to you to do something about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He also said that we're going to try to do a better job of or you ought to do a better job of making your content sticky.  And we like to do a better job of having that work for you because that helps us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. So Marissa talked about I asked about what they're going to do about newspapers and the press.  And she said it focuses on two things.  One is make them money and find more ways to make them more money.  And I'll come back to that in one second.  And the second is trying to improve the form of news and make it more compelling and engaging because newspaper people aren't making it very engaging on the ad side.  And I frankly didn't fully understand this, but they what they said was that their next big push in in this world is going to be into display.  They're going to bring the science of Google, they said, to display.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I read that on your post.  I don't know what that means to mean the banner ads.  Yeah. And so what they're going to do is so funny to hear them say the next big thing is display when most of the rest of the world is saying, what do we do besides display?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's where so much money is, is branding as opposed to click through stuff.  And what they said was that advertisers now buy sites.  Yes.  Google's going to enable them to buy audiences.  And I said, well, they're going to aggregate.  Yeah, they're going to aggregate audience and then give you demographics and stuff.  But I said, doesn't that yet again disintermediate publishers and hurt their branding?  Well, basically, the answer was if they make more money, dot, dot, dot.  They won't mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  One of our German listeners in the chat room says Berta is kind of the Rupert Murdoch of Germany, kind of old and out of touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, actually he's...  Doesn't sound like it actually.  No, he tried to be rather hip.  They invested in Glam, Etsy, science blogs.  They're actually pretty cool.  He asked the right question.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He wanted to know what percentage am I getting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think transparency was a fair argument to make, but I'm not sure all fellow publishers agree.  But the point is we're seeing some movement here and it was neat to see it from one conference to the next.  And I asked Google people whether this was actually news.  They said, yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's great.  It seems very doable to me.  I mean, Amazon does it.  You see how much you get a report with everything that people bought, how much it costs, what percentage you got from that.  I mean, and it changes depending on how much you sell.  It doesn't seem...  And this aligns totally with Google's whole transparency, openness, Google dashboard thing, right?  I mean, it seems like presenting those numbers is a no-brainer.  I'm surprised they haven't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, you're right, Gina.  When they started talking about display and how this becomes a platform and network that anyone can use, any site can use, then as I think about it, you mentioned this, it becomes even more important for them to be transparent about that.  Because if you're going to hand over a big hunk of your ad inventory that you sell, then you'd better know what the business deal is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So now when we say display, are we talking about individual banner ads or are we talking about buying the entire page and filling every ad space with a particular campaign or even custom graphics on top of a logo?  Are we talking about branding a whole site or are we just talking about regular banner ads?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we're talking basically about regular banner ads and such, you know, big-ass ads, as we call them, or other forms.  There's a whole bunch of standard forms from the IAB, the Internet Advertising Bureau.  I'm sure Google will sell them all.  And so, you know, they'll be as creative as they can.  But basically, I think that might work for a site that says, I have no sales force, monetize me.  But for a big brand, they'll give Google their remnant unsold inventory, which all sites have plenty.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what happens at Lifehacker.  Lifehacker sells in all the Gawker sites, right?  The sales team sells custom campaigns, some of which includes branding for the whole site.  And then remnant are AdSense and other kind of programmatic banners.  But those are just banners or units, you know, versus like kind of big branding thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Great. More banner ads.  Yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We love banner ads. Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Before we get to China, some other news from the briefing here in Davos from Google was that they're very proud now of YouTube and say it's making money.  Yeah.  When pressed about the definition of what that means, Schmidt wouldn't say, well, it depends on the accounting rules you use.  But he would say, which accounting rules?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you make the point that it could be cash flow or it could be profit, either one.  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Right.  But he, you know, he praised Chad Hurley for finding the way to have YouTube make money.  He's very happy with it now that the distribution deals they're doing with big entertainment companies are working.  They did a big deal in the UK with channels four and five.  Hurley said they have double clicked now into YouTube, the ad serving platform, and they're selling ads on YouTube in 20 countries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hold on. Heather Gold. Gold is here.  Hello, Heather. Hey, Heather. Just joined us in the studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hi, Gina. Jeff, I barely recognize you because you look so African to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, it's amazing, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll start. The guys downstairs playing drums were incredible.  Oh, that's neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, Jeff, are those double click putting in video ads or static ads?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On YouTube, they're, uh...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they're just those slide up, slide under ads. I haven't seen any pre or post roll yet.  But, I mean, I'm sure that they would like to do that.  But double click does serve those ads that come up and sit there and annoy you until you click the X.  Those come from double click.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. And they're based on the tags with the video?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They seem to have some relationship to something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because there's a lot of porn stuff on YouTube.  I mean, it means that whoever's advertising there is getting a lot of stuff they may not.  For example, today I went to try to research some stuff, Gina, for the show.  And I went to my YouTube account.  And the latest comment on one of my videos is, you should have acid thrown in your face.  Great!  Which is awesome.  Yeah.  There happens to be no way to report that person.  And so, you know, you could be advertising on that. That's always fun.  Like a little homophobic terror.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I doubt it's comments. I would imagine that it's title, tags, caption.  And those things are all description. Those things are all required, right? When you upload a YouTube video.  But this is historic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't control what it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, just given the tenor of a lot of what's on YouTube, it seems like a bit of an...  Like, I can understand if they...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's historically the big problem with this kind of advertising, to be honest.  On YouTube in particular.  In YouTube, MySpace, it was a big problem.  Is that you just don't know where your ad... what your ad is going to be on.  And I think there's a lot of resistance from advertisers.  And the ones I've talked to say that these ads are not effective either.  That they're probably as ineffective as other display ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know how they're effective? People reach to close them and miss the X and click on them.  And then it looks like they got clicks. That's how effective they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You hit the nail on the head. That's exactly right.  You got it.  That's when it's happening, is there... as people are... click to close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like that flyover BS, which I can't stand. They're just like, they're so effective.  It's like, no, that's people trying to close them. That's people trying to... like not understanding what's happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We had Jacob Nielsen, the usability expert on Net at Night on Tuesday.  And they do the eye tracking stuff.  And he said the most effective advertising, his new book on eye tracking the web says,  the most effective advertising is text. Google AdSense style text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How is he judging effectiveness based on whether you like it or you click on it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Whether you notice it.  He said, well, to give him the full quote, text and cleavage.  But if you look on the... I'm not... hey, I'm sorry, but that's...  Text in the cleavage?  No, not text in the cleavage. Well, you know, I don't think they tested that.  So the idea is what they do is they test hotspots on the page where people are reading and looking.  And so they can see that you are reading the display ads get completely ignored.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you've just saved the ad industry and the media industry all at once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Text and cleavage, everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Hollywood's known about the latter for a long time.  I remember on the screensavers, we had a Hollywood producer come in and said, you know, it's missing on this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Cleavage. I brought cleavage today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you. You don't have to display it. You just have it.  That's the beauty of it.  Put an ad on, hey, Leo.  No. But if you look at Facebook, what do you see on the right?  Maybe you guys don't see it, but on my Facebook, that's what's always on the right is there's a text ad and there's cleavage.  Always. I'll go there right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Generally. Well, because you're a guy. If you're a woman, you don't get as much cleavage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that the case?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, because they're trying to give you things. I get crazy stuff that I would never be interested in.  But they try. They're trying.  That I want something pink.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You get more pink ads?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I totally get pink ads.  That's interesting.  And they try to pull you stuff that I guess people that you're really connected to somehow they've decided are endorsing companies, which I don't understand that.  I really hate that.  I can't believe some of the people I know, they're like, I want to call my friends and say, did you really?  What did you do that has Facebook saying you endorse this company or this ad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In any event, it's interesting that Google, after all of that, after all we know about what seems to work on the Internet, is saying display ads are the next big thing.  I wonder if that's a little disingenuous.  Isn't there a lot of pressure on them to say that YouTube is not draining the company dry, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. These are two separate things.  The display ad thing is them trying to give more money to publishers and get more inventory from publishers and more information.  I think on YouTube you're exactly right.  And you know what? If it's a stop of drainage, that's fine.  We had the discussion on the earlier show that maybe it doesn't actually cost them as much as we think.  Right.  And they didn't want anybody else to own video.  You know, what he's saying is there's profound progress at YouTube.  And I think that's something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Also, a word on the new Google Books settlement, the new one, because the first one got trashed, mostly because the DOJ said it's probably illegal.  And yesterday was the last day for comments on the new proposed settlement, according to an article in Ars Technica on their Law and Disorder blog.  Pretty much the same suspects filed pretty much the same objections to the new Google proposals.  Ursula K. Le Guin organized 350 authors who objected to the fact that the agreement would apply to anyone who didn't opt out.  She said it should be opt in, not opt out, and that it's a change in copyright policy.  The estate of Richard Wright weighed in as well in what Ars Technica called a diatribe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  An estate had a diatribe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The estate was diatribing.  It's like from the grave?  I don't know. Well, you know, maybe his heirs are very defensive of his stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the JD Salinger's lost book should now appear only on Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Rest in peace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of the changes, this is really goofy.  One of the changes Google proposed, Google will help set book prices by, this is an engineer, engineers figured this out, help set book prices by developing an algorithm that simulates what the prices would be if there were competitive market conditions.  Amazon said, well, that's price fixing by a computer instead of a human.  What's the difference?  The claim, Amazon says, that this is acceptable or well-intentioned price fixing because it will supposedly mimic the market does nothing to save the revised agreement.  It also argued that some of the changes only cover direct to consumer sales and keep exclusive arrangements in place for subscription and institutional services.  Basically the same Internet Archive had the same objections.  Public knowledge objected.  I don't know if this book deal is going to ever go.  I really don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So what Jeff, if you could orchestrate it the way you wanted it, what do you think it should be?  The book deal?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, geez, you're making me think it's late at night here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think this is, boy, greater minds than ours have attempted for years to figure this out and with no success.  So Jeff, if you can't figure it out in one minute at Davos, I don't blame you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the place for diplomacy and solutions to all the world's problems.  You know, I think what we've got to do is put the fence around the real issue, which is the orphan works, and leave those aside and give control to this, which basically already exists, to rights holders, whether that's the writer or the publisher, and get on with it.  And then we can, you know, it's like the health bill.  We can mop up the details later.  But stopping the digitization of books and the benefits that come from that, I think, is criminal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does seem to be that the orphan works are the chief area, although Google still would have, according to the ARS report, a significant degree of control over the future market for digitized works, essentially asserting that they're the ones who get to sell them once they digitize them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The orphan works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, is it only orphan works? I guess so. If they're not orphaned, then the owner, the rights holder has the rights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For some reason, this reminds me of a Hopi Goldberg movie I once saw, a really bad one, Jump and Jack Flash, where the evil person's plan was that they'd found a way to take everyone's half cents or somehow in their bank accounts and sucked all of them up.  Same plot point as used in Office Space and Superman 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really? I'm sure it's got to be in ten other films.  It's a great plot point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sorry, I'm making it fine, but someone said, I know, I'll build an internet company on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We will take the crumbs.  Well, anyway, so there's an update on the, I was asking this last week, what's the story with the Google Book deal?  And it is now, of course, in the hands of the judge, but it sounds like the same exact objections.  And the DOJ weighed in again saying this would change copyright law.  So you've got to think the judge is just going to say, well, I don't know.  What's the judge going to say? We asked you to go back.  They don't like to change things.  No, not copyright law, not in a civil suit. It's kind of anathema.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and it is a problem. In Germany, the publishers are hiding behind the skirts of Chancellor Angela Merkel asking to change copyright law for their benefit.  Copyright screwed up, but if we start mucking around with the law, you may need to do that, but bad things can happen.  Then it gets out of control. You never know what's going to happen in the legislative process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the YouTube page has been redesigned. Anybody notice that? I don't like it. I can't do full screen as easily as I used to be able to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why? Why can't you do it as easily?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it just me or is there no longer a full screen button on the darn thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a full screen button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think that's changed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You mean that thing with the four arrows?  The four arrows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You press the four arrows.  Okay, it is on some, I guess not on all videos then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did they add this little, what is this little two-way arrow thing? Is that new?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, that's what I saw. On some pages I only see that and then it's a pop out.  They added this middle deal.  Yeah, I don't like the middle deal. I don't see the four corner one on all my pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it only on HD or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have to say, yeah, I don't know what the difference is, but they don't all have it sometimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, I'm looking at a page right now.  Here, I'll put it up on the screen.  Let me play with the settings here briefly so I can get it up on the screen for you.  Take it out of double box.  And this is, I don't know why, for some reason this video, you see, is like a lot of them.  It doesn't have that pop out box anywhere.  It just has this arrow thing.  Watch this video in a new window.  And then when I do that, then I think usually I get the four corner pop out.  Yeah, see now I can go full screen, but I have to, it's two clicks now.  Two clicks.  But that's not on every page.  A lot of these pages don't have this, they just have this simplified player bar.  I can't figure it out.  And then I've got the HTML5 thing going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And how's that changing it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm no longer using Flash, so maybe that's what's changed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That might be it because I keep clicking and I can't find one video without.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You get it, okay.  So maybe it's because I went to HTML5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, is this camera on?  Do you have an option to do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, that's kind of a neat new thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It lets you set the preference.  Yeah.  Oh, I see.  I didn't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if you Google YouTube HTML5, then you'll go to youtube.com slash HTML5.  And then you can say, I want to enter the HTML5 beta.  And then I guess in some cases, maybe that's why I get a full screen is when you do a pop out  that it suddenly goes to Flash and now I go full screen because apparently HTML5 doesn't have full screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, if you had an iPad, it would just be full screen.  You're kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You said the I word and now we've got to talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've got to talk about it.  It was inevitable.  Did you notice that we've got a full half hour and we haven't mentioned it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I knew you had it because I liked the genus links.  I was like, she's trying to not go there.  Well, you know, let's go there.  But before we do, let's do an I keep her alternative and an I pawn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, sorry, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jeff's looking like what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What?  All the guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I pawn Jeff looks like he should be in twilight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can sleep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You look like you should be in twilight.  Avatar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Avatar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you blue?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, no, I'm happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

That's how I like to think of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Day pass.  Doesn't that make it sound nice?  It's like a spa.  You get a role.  So speaking of spas.  Yes.  How's that?  How's that for cool?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, very cool.  Is it super swing there?  I'm addicted to the saunas now.  Say again?  I'm addicted to the sauna.  And you're not even in Finland.  Saunas are awesome.  And down here in Davos, it's magnificent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's good when it's really cold.  It's a cabin outside the whole house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a cabin outside the whole house.  It's a cabin outside the whole house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to the sauna.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Jeff, is everything paved in gold?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that runs the world?  Here's the funny thing, Hannah.  The hotels are all sucky.  Really?  They're awful.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're terrible.  They're terrible.  It's a summer camp for moguls.  Wow.  Oh, yeah, I've noticed that about recent hotels.  I've noticed that about recent hotels.  But it's the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's a great point.  Yeah.  I mean, I think that's a great point.  You know, the hotels are way too expensive.  It's a lot of fun.  I mean, I think they're terrible.  They're terrible.  It's a summer camp for moguls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  Oh, yeah.  I've noticed that about rich people.  I went up to the Bohemian Grove for some of the richer...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You went to the Bohemian Grove.  Yeah, and somehow...  Now, we need to spend the rest of the show on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The richer they are, the more down market they like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Seriously?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I peed on a tree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You did?  Sure.  Do you feel closer to Kissinger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, he wasn't there at the time.  No, he didn't cross streams.  You know, it's funny.  No, I didn't.  But even at the Bohemian Grove, the George Shultz Kissinger types have a removed cabin  distant from the rest of the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And is their cabin really all that different?  No, and that's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like shat carpeting there.  No, it's rustic.  And that's the whole point of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is this kind of Burning Man for old farts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  When really, really rich and powerful guys get together, it's the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay.  That is proof that the really rich and powerful people are wasps.  They are wasps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're wasps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's exactly right.  I am Googling Bohemian Grove right now.  Oh, you never heard of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Bohemian Grove is this creepy little place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not old and rich and powerful, clearly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here's the deal, Gina.  They don't let women go, except prostitutes they bring up.  Just for the record, I saw no prostitutes.  A little bit north of San Francisco, it's connected to the Bohemian Club, which is in  San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very nice gentleman's club in San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Started years ago by journalists and artists, but it's not that Bohemian because it's mostly  George Schultz and Kissinger.  They all kind of get together.  Conspiracy theorists go bazooka with this thing like Gina.  If you start Googling, it'll be like there's a ritual with a giant owl, and the demons  come out at midnight, and they all have group sex with a twig.  People think that's how the world's getting run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not.  But it is a time where a lot of really powerful people from-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If there's a complaint about it, it's that they have access to each other in a way that  we don't because they get together, but they have that no matter what in their private  jets, at Davos, wherever they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's ritualized, and I think that creeps people out.  I know you dropped out, Leo, but I stayed at Yale long enough to witness the-  Skull and bones.  Skull and bones.  The boyfriend, yes, I had a boyfriend, was in Wolf's Head, and I went into one of the-  I've been in there too.  It's BS.  But they have some creepiness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, they make up stuff.  It's to totally give people the sense that they are somehow magical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're trying to feel safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're trying to feel special.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They need magic bones and stuff.  And it's the same BS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're just like you and me.  There's no power.  They're more scared.  They're just more scared.  They're more scared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's why they need the sarcophagus and the bones and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what I see here at Davos is what's here are the powerful who are all being disrupted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they're scared for real.  Really?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did a session yesterday.  I led one on transparency in international organizations, and that ain't coming soon.  Bankers, governments, whatever, media companies, the powerful are here, but they're not going  to be powerful for long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I think Apple chose the name iPad at one of these camp things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There were no girls, that's for sure.  I'm sure this is what happened.  There were no women.  There were no ladies there.  Maybe it happened at Bohemian Grove.  Could very well be.  Could very well be.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, you wanted to talk about the iPad or is it-  No, you were the one who dropped that.  Do we need to get rid of the-  I know that people are- I mean, it might not be technical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think iPad is appropriate because it's kind of a cloud device.  It's certainly aimed at the Kindle.  In my opinion-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, and the netbook?  No.  No?  You don't think it's aimed at netbooks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  I think it's very precisely not aimed at netbooks because if for half the money you could get  something that has a camera, flash, multitasking, all the things that people want, and a keyboard,  all the things people complained about.  Now I know that Steve mentioned the netbook, but I think really it's aimed at the Kindle.  It's a Kindle Plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is that because you think of the kind of person who wants a netbook as someone who  might really program or use it in a more serious way?  Because a lot of the netbooks are aimed at least from as far as I understand in Europe,  and this is mostly from Clive Thompson telling me this, that those devices are aimed at trying  to make the computer more like the phone so that the device costs very little so that  you're really sucked into the ongoing data play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if that's the case, then Apple did a better job than whoever's designing the netbooks.  The netbooks are just little laptops, underpowered laptops that are really cheap and they sell  because they're really cheap.  But I don't think that's what Apple should be going after.  To me, it's a content device, so having a camera doesn't make a lot of sense.  In fact, I don't even understand why they had a keyboard extension on it.  But I'm curious if in Davos people are talking about it, because I would think if I were  creating magazines or newspapers, I'd be very interested in this device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, a lot of publishers came by acting as if it was going to be the Messiah, and  the when it wasn't, they still had hope.  The publisher of the New York Times is here.  I talked to a lot of German publishers and UK and American publishers.  One of the publishers came by and said, oh yes, finally we can go like this again.  We can move the pages.  And I said, sorry, but serial media is over.  Serial media is gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The link is up to that.  Yeah, but there is something to be said for skimming.  You think skimming's dead?  No, but I think-  So this is a great skimming device.  This is a device-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you can skim most anything, but I think what they really want-  You can't skim on the Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You cannot skim on the Kindle.  Kindle is a crappy skimming device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But what they really want is something that regains their control over our experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well that's not going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And no, that's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although Apple's trying- you know, the fact that Apple has made this ecosystem where really  most of the time you don't look at stuff on web pages, the New York Times will have a  New York Times button, right?  A New York Times icon, a New York Times application where they control the interface and all of  that stuff.  Ultimately, you and I both know they're going to have to do it on a web page if they want  to make it.  But the iPad gives them a way to make it a button.  And I'll tell you, as Twitter, that's the only way we can do it because it doesn't support  flash, so what we will do is have an HTML5-style application that has video and audio in the  chat room.  And it's going to be an excellent experience for anybody who wants to consume our content  live or on demand.  And I think that a lot of content creators, if they're creative, will think of ways to  make this a very powerful platform for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's exciting for creators.  Yeah.  Definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the total penetration of this thing could possibly be?  How many units could it really-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, according to TechCrunch, and I don't know if Mike knows something or is BSing as  often as the case, but he says 3 million Kindles have been sold in two years.  That's not very many.  I think that- and how many iPhones?  75 million iPhones in three years.  I think you're much closer to the iPhone end of the scale than it is the Kindles end of  the scale.  If you could sell- I think they'll sell 5 million in the first year.  They'll sell 10 in the second, 30 in the third.  That's a pretty powerful platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's no salvation.  Well, yeah.  It's powerful, but it's not a salvation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, the thing is, Jeff, isn't there two things?  Is there actual business that could be in terms of wanting that saved, and then there's  the way life works as I know it being saved, and as you've been such an eloquent spokesperson  for it, that's been over a long time.  But in a way, I read a really nice little piece that Gruber linked off to.  I added it up there, Gina, by Fraser Spears.  The same thing is kind of happening for a lot of geeks too in the sense that the web  is hitting a place to some degree, not everywhere.  It's big enough to do everything.  Where the experience on this device is- I mean, it's not as geeky.  It doesn't give you all that control you talked about, Leo.  So in the same thing, post social media, there's going to be a way in which people will experience  it that talks about the touch points entertainment publishing business works on, emotion and  feeling and connection, and comes from that human experience down as opposed to from the  code experience up.  And I think that is disconcerting for a lot of geeks, and I agree with this piece by Spears  that that's one of the reasons people online have been a little wonky about the-  Oh, people are very upset about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's as if they- there's two groups of people.  There's people who had such high hopes for it that it couldn't live up to them.  They didn't get the unicorn and pixie dust that they were counting on.  And then there's people who hate Apple and just kind of hate the idea of a closed box,  which it is, and are saying, well, it's too closed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But Spears is saying it's people who are doing the opposite thing what Jeff's saying the  publishers are doing, which is they liked the world in a way the way it was.  Geeks feel like you got to go through us because we make this stuff work and we know how it  works and publishers getting got to go through us because I know how things really work.  And both of them losing that, essentially.  But you can't-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What I think it says too is that- and Mitchell Baker, the head of Firefox, the foundation,  said here at Davos that- or actually up at the DLD that the browser is out loaded now  just in the sense that we haven't seen any big changes in too long.  And so maybe one of the impact of the Apple product is that it makes us rethink the browser  and the webpage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and that happened when the iPod Touch came out.  Everything was application based.  But it does have a pretty full feature browser minus Flash, which frankly I don't mind losing  Flash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Eric Schmidt here, when we asked him about the tablet and asked him whether they were  going to have one, he said, somebody tell me the difference between a tablet and a big  iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there isn't.  And that's the whole point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm planning on making the tablet my new phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How?  Which I've been tunnel vision.  I've been on a big wave.  Oh, you want to hang it around your neck?  Totally.  It's bling.  And I'm going to get to have different images on it all the time.  I actually-  I handled it and I loved it.  You know, because then where I have Wi-Fi, I can just have Skype because I hate AT&T.  I'm trying to get away from them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I loved- I thought it was a beautiful device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you're buying one, Leo, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm the wrong person to ask because I have to buy everything.  But yeah, I'm actually- and I think if I were- well, I am a content creator, but I think  content creators are going to be very interested in this.  I think Amazon is going to have an interesting challenge.  But remember, Amazon is not really in the Kindle business.  They're in the book business.  So in the long run-  Right.  You know, it's interesting.  Macmillan all of a sudden disappeared from the Amazon store yesterday.  And the thinking is, oh, Macmillan's preparing to move to the iBook store.  But if I were Amazon, I'd be meeting with Steve Jobs like crazy right now saying, well,  let's work this out.  We want to sell books on the iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you- the night before the iPad was announced, I can't believe I said iPad.  It's as bad as a vlog and webinar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we're stuck with those two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Amazon announced that they reversed their split on share, on royalty share with publishers.  They went from 3070 to 7030.  And Paul Schreiber sent that to me.  Thanks, Paul.  And I did tweet it.  I can look for the link from him.  But it's like, well, you know, I always thought that share was wrong.  But-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Heather, is that after cost to AT&T?  That's an interesting point.  But I don't know-  More than half the money goes to AT&T.  And then Amazon was saying, well, we give you the publishers more than half of what's  left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, Amazon put out a press release on their site saying that not comparing themselves  to the iPad, I'm really saying I'm assuming they put the release out because of the iPad,  that they reversed their split from 7030 Amazon published, like, book holder to reverse 3070.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So maybe Amazon is trying to hold on to the business.  They also announced an SDK.  They're encouraging developers to write third party applications, which, well, Gina, as  a developer, surely the Kindle is not the platform you can't wait to write for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  I mean, come on.  I mean, it's a nice idea, but-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, you know, I think the only question that remains at all is, is it is comfortable to  read on the iPad?  We won't know this for two months on the iPad as it is to read on the Kindle.  Because if it can-  The ink is the difference.  Yeah.  I've never- ink isn't that high contrast.  It's solid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just, you know, I just hate looking at a bright screen, a backlit screen, it's just  hard on the eyes.  Okay.  So that's the real question.  I do think that the iPad with the Kindle app and Instapaper would be a much better browsing  experience.  And I can't, as much as I have a lot of problems with it, I can't wait to hold it and try it  as well.  And I'm sure it's a fantastic experience.  It's a beautiful thing to hold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's an amazing thing to hold.  I have to say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what about you two?  Are you going to buy it?  It won't be quite as comfortable to read on the eyes as the Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I don't know, but that's the question.  Don't you read on the LCD all day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And at the end of the day, I don't want to look at a screen anymore.  I want to pick up my Kindle or look at the paper because my eyes are done.  I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Jeff's question, would you buy it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not sure yet.  I don't think I'm going to buy it.  I'm going to go to the store and check it out.  I mean, to me, the iPad is just this, you know, it's just a giant iPod touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Would you buy it if it had Android on it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, I would.  Yes, I would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The trouble goes, too, is that Schmidt here in Davos emphasized that the strategy is entirely  to get as many devices out there as possible.  And then the audience for it will lead to application development.  And he said the phone is the applications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep.  Yep.  And that's true.  And, you know, and the reason why, you know, the reason why I would get it if it had Android  on it is because, you know, my issue with it is that Apple decides what you can run  on the device.  Very close to.  Apple decides that you can't get a porn app and Apple decides that you can't get Google  Voice on your iPhone.  And maybe Apple is going to decide that you can't run the Kindle app because they've got  their own bookstore.  They haven't done that.  But they could, you know, make Apple decides.  Right.  And it's a device that's just like not that customizable.  It's not OS 10.  You know, I don't know.  Maybe everyone was like, well, why is everybody surprised that it's so closed?  This is this thing is a computer.  And I thought that maybe there's a possibility that a run full on OS 10 versus this kind  of lockdown iPhone operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you think someone can make it run OS 10?  I'm not as.  Or Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How about running Android or running Android?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, with the with the custom chip that they developed in house, it will be much more  difficult.  That's probably why they do it.  I think I have a lot of faith in our in our in our hackers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It'll be jailbroken right away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It will be jailbroken.  Although I'm hearing that that custom chip will make jailbreaking difficult.  And it could it could be a while.  And, you know, Apple goes out of their way to un-jailbreak with every software update.  You know, your device gets un-jailbroken and that takes time and effort.  Like they they don't want people to jailbreak.  They make otherwise known as regailing.  I would do that.  Regailing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that what it's called?  I love that.  I like it.  I've been re-jailed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is this where the iPhone goes then?  Are they going to have the jailbreak proof chip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, well, you know, I feel like them developing a chip in house is a significant thing for  them to do.  I've heard a lot of a lot of reasons why they may have.  Maybe they needed a chip that was fast enough they could handle multitasking, right?  Because it's one of the big the big reasons, you know, that that Android one thing big  thing that Android can do the iPhone can't do.  Did they do it to prevent jailbreaking?  I mean, did they do it so that they can offer a different, you know, something different  than anybody else could possibly offer because it has Apple, you know, proprietary hardware?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Supposedly, it's ARM code.  It's an A9.  It's a custom ASIC part with the A9 cortex on it and or ARM chip on it and and custom  GPU on it.  But really, I think you hit the nail on.  I mean, it's not so very different than, say, a Snapdragon or the Tegra.  In fact, it's a lot like a Tegra 2.  But Apple controls what code can be run on it.  So I think it's really I think you probably hit the nail on the head that the real reason  for a custom chip is not performance, but control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Control.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This all said, I mean, I like you'd say everything, but he I mean, he's mostly writing about performances  first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We didn't know about the chip.  And it's only lately that that started to leak out.  And it's not coming from Apple.  And it may not be true even.  But it's OK.  But some but some bloggers are saying, oh, there's one blogger.  I'll see if I can find the link to it who says I talked to the foundry and he said and  that they said, yeah, this is the A9 in here.  So Apple's being very cagey.  Apple's not saying all they're saying is we designed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not this all said, I just want you all to know that I'm going to do my best to get  my book in the in the iBook store.  So you know, well, and think about this, think about this, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, not only is it a book, but it's a book that can have video and audio and multimedia.  It's a much richer experience.  It's a Harry Potter book.  It could come alive.  It can come alive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's the EPUB format.  But it's with lockdown.  So EPUB is an electronic book standard, right?  A pretty open standard, from what I understand.  I actually I've just gotten into this whole electronic book publishing thing.  So I don't know a whole lot.  But from what I understand, there will be DRM.  So you will only be able to read the book on your iPad.  Or I'm assuming there's going to be some sort of limit to the number of devices you can  read it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  EPUB doesn't require DRM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it doesn't.  But Apple is going to include DRM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you sell it in the iBook store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you sell it in the iBook store.  Right.  So does EPUB support multimedia then?  It supports video.  And that's fantastic.  Yeah.  So I'm excited about that.  So as much of a problem as I have with it being sort of a closed platform, and as much  as I don't want to have a device where Apple decides what I can run on it, what I can't,  as a publisher, I am going to put my book in the bookstore because people aren't going  to buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's so many more people to digital books.  I mean, maybe I'm the most pedestrian one, probably of the four of us, but I'm probably  going to get it.  But my thinking is, you know, I got the iPhone so early and I'm really hoping my contract's  done soon.  And once that happens, I might just go back to this other phone and use that for everything  else.  Because when I travel, for no other reason, it is like I travel a ton.  And the idea of carrying something that's one pound around is one and a half pounds  is nice.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you travel with a laptop too?  Yeah, I travel with this MacBook Pro and I love this computer.  But, you know, I really would like to limit my weight on me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you what if you have to do a long email or something?  I'd get that little docky thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I would. I mean, I'm pretty good on the phone.  Like I have teeny weeny hands, but it's pretty tight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's better than the phone. It's pretty tight.  I'm sure it would be better than the phone.  I mean, it's got the keys are almost the same size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I want to try the physical little thing where it stands on the little stand and I would  type because I can see and I write a lot in airplanes and I can see that as a really  nice little simple way to.  For me to do just basic writing.  I mean, I wouldn't, you know, I wouldn't be doing video editing on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's my guess that people who want a laptop out of it are going to be a little disappointed  that it's not quite there yet.  On the other hand, Apple clearly thinks so because they're offering pages, numbers and

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  people's use of a laptop.  I don't know what the ergonomic experience will be, but it'll be sufficient because I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  think most people don't use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They don't use much.  Not maybe, you know, probably people in the Twitter army, but I certainly can think of  lots of people who don't use it.  Slide deck.  Right.  I mean, unfortunately, I have more slide decks.  That's unfortunate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo, how does the file system work?  Like with iWork, if you launch it on the iPad and you create a file, then what?  Do you email it to yourself?  Do you sync it with iTunes?  What is that like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, this is, it's very unclear and it doesn't appear to have an accessible file  system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's no explore.  You can't look at your file system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But nor does the iPod touch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like the way iTunes, you'll control the sync.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's really, as far as I can tell, it's running iPhone 3.2.  It is an iPod touch with a big screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  So, but you're creating files in iWork.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you're clearly creating files somewhere.  Now, it may be, remember Apple has a cloud solution for its iWork already.  Does it?  Yeah.  And in fact, it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not MobileMe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it works quite well.  So, it's possible that they will support that.  I would expect them to support that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's not MobileMe.  They have a separate cloud solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, maybe it's linked to MobileMe.  But if you use iWork, you could just say, I want to save this up to the cloud and share  it.  And it works quite well.  You can share it.  You can have it accessible to yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ryan in the chat room says, when you connect iPad to Mac PC, you get a file system mount  point with shared docs.  How does he know that?  With iPad apps, it'd be a Gruber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder how Gruber knows that.  I mean, we got to play with it.  We didn't get to connect it to anything.  He just touched it in his mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I could tell.  He knew everything that was in the device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there are questions in that.  They're going to have to solve that.  And certainly, you could probably sink it.  To me, it seemed very odd that Apple released these three applications and a keyboard because  that seemed counter to me to what this device natively is, which is a content consumption  device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It sounds like it doesn't know what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Then that's a mistake.  If Apple...  I think Jobs made some mistakes.  He shouldn't have mentioned Netbooks because it's not where he's...  He should have mentioned the Kindle more than the Netbook.  He shouldn't have made these applications because that implies that it's a computer.  I don't even know if he should have had email.  It's really a content consumption device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But what about all the people who like really cheap computers, who use them unbelievably  simply for a little bit of word processing?  Maybe.  And most people think for those people, it is a less expensive laptop where Apple competes  with other companies that have less expensive laptops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the $499 price point is a key part of it because if any more than that, it's  too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're seriously in the content business in a big way to me.  That's to me.  They want to be in the content.  That's the sweet spot.  They're going to replace the interface for the television.  I've known they want to work...  I did some work with Tony Fidel who helped make the iPod happen at the startup before  he went to Apple.  It's one of the things I know he's been thinking about for an awfully long time.  I know he's left Apple, but I'd be very surprised if they weren't thinking about how do I get  the main interface to all this programming because that's going to be a tremendous point  of business control.  Just tremendous.  And frankly, the interface from Comcast and every other company is so horrible that it's  a big opportunity.  So that's my entertainment background sense of the device.  No, I'm with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think that that's when the device explodes is when all these content companies start  building.  Gina, you may not want to publish a book in the iBook store.  You might want to make a complete Google Wave application instead.  A lot of publishers do that, which would give you a lot more control.  And by the way, look at the kind of ecosystem Apple has built recently.  You can have in-store, rather in-application sales.  So games do that now.  They'll sell levels within the application.  You never have to exit the application to buy another level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, there's a lot of capability here that I think content creators are just going to  die to get involved in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it makes the form of content you work in more malleable because we've had, I mean,  you know, Jeff, the entertainment businesses traditionally had all these separate revenue  windows and they've done it by having it be a separate form.  And they've been very attached to the form.  It's a book.  It's a CD-ROM.  It's a whatever.  And now, because right away, even the publishing itself has multimedia within it, you're already  shifting your content experience past those static forms.  So I think it has, I think that might.  I think you're right, Heather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it also increases the cost of creating content.  It was no big deal to have a little something.  Well, wait a minute, wait a minute, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you don't, there's no dead trees and no trucks and no, doesn't it reduce the cost  of content?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you make a movie and you make it for DVD and you add some scenes.  You make a book and you.  Yeah, but.  But now you're going to be expected to add stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't 30, isn't the cost of the New York Times only 35 percent of the cost of the New  York Times is actual editorial?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's what I'm saying is, Leo, that when you add the need to create that content in  another format, you have increased the cost of the content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I can tell you New York Times does video online and they never did that before when  they were just a newspaper, that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  But they're going to save all this money on dead trees.  Doesn't that pay for it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a separate issue.  It's a British.  What I'm saying is that this doesn't eliminate the dead trees yet.  I think it'll happen, but it doesn't eliminate that.  But it does increase your cost of content.  So you make something for the paper, then you make it for the web.  And now there's this new richer experience and you have to make it for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now, what I'm saying, Jeff, is I think we change the production process, which I think has  slowly been happening, which is you don't iterate.  You make the stuff more all at once.  The production process shifts.  I don't think it's we made one item and then we shift everything into separate forms.  Well, you're right about that.  I think the creation process changes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All I'm saying is you're going to have to have new expertise and new thought through  this.  And I think that what we're going to see at first is shovelware so everybody will be  underwhelmed.  Right.  And then somebody will come along and do wow-y stuff, but then you've got to hire people  to do the wows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That might be the big risk for Apple here is shovelware because that's what killed CD-ROMs.  Right.  People were not willing as content creators to innovate.  Right.  And it completely killed the format.  And I could kill the iPad if content creators don't step up and say we're going to take  advantage of this medium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the difference is between CD-ROM and this is think of all the iPhone app makers.  There is a lot more room.  If you're letting all the independent filmmakers, all the people that whatever at IC, at South  by who are already making more transmedia kind of forms, who are making films that involve  gaming with the film, that involve book elements and you create.  Yeah, but your audience for all that stuff is much larger, Heather.  I'm just saying that the competition doesn't only come from HarperCollins and the other  big publisher.  It also comes from independent creators.  Yeah, yeah.  In a much, who have a much faster way to distribute than they ever did with CD-ROM right next  door, like on the same screen, the same shelf space as so-called shelf space is the next  publisher.  So, and with more of a sense of, I think that kind of linear model is still the mentality  of publishing better than me.  But from what I know, they entertain business.  They're still very slow to think.  They think across synergies in terms of objects.  Oh, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why they talk about this desire for the serial experience again, that they can  put out their magazine.  It's basically the new PDF in their minds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But if they were creating transmedia from the beginning, it would be a different process.  I'm not saying it's simple, but I know I spent five years on my own talk show trying to develop  a kind of shoot one to run anywhere model.  I mean, it's weak and it's small and it's indie.  But I think if you had a little more resource, and studios certainly do, there are ways to  do it.  There are ways to create.  If you put a little more time and money in front of the creation, then you've got it.  You can make the app piece of it that lets you upgrade.  And the social gaming possibilities to me of this device are pretty awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It'd be better if it had multitasking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's the only, no, it's the first thing I thought of too.  And it kind of bugs me because it's almost like going back to DOS where you can only  do one thing at a time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What if you make an app that puts multiple things in the app?  You'd have to do it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In fact, that's how we would, if we did a twit app for it, that's what we would do.  Because I'd like to have chat at the same time as you're watching or listening.  But in order to do that, you have to make an app that has it all built in.  You can't just kind of have one going in the background while the other is going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But then at least you'd see it all along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not ideal.  I wonder if the reason there's no multitasking is because it needed to be compatible with  the iPhone and the iPod touch and they don't, for good reasons, they don't support it.  I mean, when you have such a limited device, I can see, you know, I crashed my Nexus One  Gina today.  Really?  Well, I was trying to listen to a podcast and Listen hadn't downloaded it.  So I put Dogcatcher on there and it started downloading in the background and it used  up all the CPU cycles and I couldn't dial the phone.  I couldn't do anything to the phone.  I rebooted it and I had to kind of trick quickly before Dogcatcher launched its task,  get in there and uninstall.  I mean, it took me 45 minutes before the phone was functional again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really?  So when it crashed, it just froze completely and it only responded to the power button  or was there some sort of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you push the application button and the application slowly...  It was so tied up.  And this is the problem with multitasking is you've got these very limited processors  with very limited RAM and it's hard for them to do more than one thing at a time.  And when it's a phone, I think it's okay to say the phone has to be able to work as  a phone all the time.  It cannot be tied up.  But when it's a pad, then I think it's okay to have multitasking because, you know, first  you have a little more RAM, presumably you have a little more power and maybe you don't  need to be so concerned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But get out of mobile think.  So Heather is sitting there on her couch.  She's using this device and she's got Bluetooth headset on and it's her phone.  Well, that's...  Yeah, right on.  It's still a phone then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why do I need both?  I mean, I do for when I don't have Wi-Fi, but when I have Wi-Fi, I'd be really happy  for it to be my phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, presumably they'll allow Skype on it and it does have a microphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's why I want there to be a camera.  I do tons of video chat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'm sure version two will have a camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm sure version two will have it too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Heather will be doing podcasts with you, Leo, on her new pad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what?  It could be that we could rename it the padcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I'll be running around the neighborhood so you can get a tour while I do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you ready for padcasting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Padcasting?  I hated podcasting.  I can't even imagine calling it a padcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going with the iPone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  iPoned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, the question, the multitasking thing, I mean, this is a computer science problem,  which has existed since, you know, for decades at this point.  You know, this isn't a new issue.  We're just dealing with limited resources again.  It became less of an issue when you had really powerful desktop computers.  It seems like, I have to say, if your Nexus One froze like that and couldn't recover itself,  didn't know well enough to kill the process on its own or whatever, that's just bad design.  It should know that if it slowed down to that point, it took you 45 minutes to get it back into a functional state.  That's just unacceptable.  I agree.  Definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And, you know, the iPhone, when something crashes on the iPhone, it just shuts, you know, just closes, right?  Like the process, you know, just closes, which is also kind of weird because it doesn't give you an error message or whatever.  But at least it just closes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't lose phone functionality.  And that's the kind of the key to the whole thing.  And I can understand why it needs to be that way.  But I don't understand on a pad.  But unless you're starting to now use it for communications.  I would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I think once they put a video camera in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's going to be the MaxiPad.  That's the next generation.  MaxiPad. Oh, you've already named it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can we just go back to the name thing?  It's a little offensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, the offensive.  Not because.  Go ahead, Gina.  Take it away, Gina.  All the jokes have been made, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just I just want to make it really, really clear to all our male listeners.  I don't want there to be any doubt in anyone's mind.  Like when an American woman hears the word pad, she thinks MaxiPad and Crunchpad is OK and ThinkPad is OK because like the first word is the focus of the word.  But iPad is pretty much all pad.  The word pad with MaxiPad.  So so what amazes me is that there was this like meeting of like Apple's marketing department and they decided that they were going to take the risk of having 50 percent of their market associate this device with a MaxiPad.  And like some.  I had no idea.  You guys is never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this is true to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Most things that people call sexist or racist Washington's I speak for racism.  But it's not like the thing in of itself is that horrible.  It's that it's clear that you ignored all these people and you never considered them as though they were part of and they clearly weren't in the room or couldn't say anything in the room.  That's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the Barnes and Noble e-book they called again?  The Nook e-reader.  Nookie.  And so again, they didn't they didn't ask you in a teenager.  Right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And hey, the we.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the we.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the we.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But this is the thing.  Like the we is kind of a goofy name that maybe three year olds use to describe, you know, their private parts.  You know, the nook is kind of like also a teenager.  Pat, it's just it's just not it's not a good women just don't have good.  I have a hard time writing about it.  Like I don't want to I don't want to write it.  I feel kind of gross.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it's funny.  My wife and daughter said the same thing to me yesterday.  And it's true.  A guy doesn't really doesn't leap to mind.  It's funny because you'd think it would be a guy would be more offended by it than a woman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The defense is not that it's bad that you mention something.  Mesturation.  Mesturation.  I mean, I don't care about that.  It's the business.  It's the ignoring people in the process and acting as though you're not going to buy it, nor were you going to name it.  It's not the people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But women wouldn't wouldn't avoid it because of the name.  Right. You wouldn't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Women know.  But it lets you know that they ignored you and they thought you weren't really part of the whole thing.  It's like, well, can I say just in defense, it's not named for me to get well, maybe me.  But, you know, I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But can I say in their defense, it's not it wasn't it was they just didn't know.  We didn't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why were there no women in?  There are no women.  That's a bigger complaint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what I'm talking about.  But there are women in the marketing department.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Someone would have said someone would have put the brakes on it.  This is the thing that's so incredible to me is that I think it's one of the biggest marketing faux pas that Apple has ever made.  It's kind of amazing because they're so good at marketing there and they're pretty good at names.  I mean, I think it's getting a little old, but for the most part, it's worked.  And I think that their marketing is always just absolutely pristine and perfectly straight on.  But this was bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Steve Jobs when when Walt Mossberg asked him about it, Steve's response and some video.  Kara Schwisher was there with a flip camera and his response was, you know, people hated iPod, too.  They'll get over it. They'll get used to it. They'll incorporate it.  I think I think there's a real cluelessness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they will. But it also doesn't it doesn't relate to me.  It was a long time ago, said Apple, but it definitely wasn't that gender savvy back in the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So at some point it goes to a company being open and point as antithetical as it is to think so, to release the names beforehand and be clued in by their users.  Gina, you were right on it saying, are you nuts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Spider in our chat room says he's developing a stylus for the iPad called the Tempen.  Tempen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I hadn't heard that one anyway. That's a new one.  There aren't that many new jokes, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I said the pricing model was light, medium, heavy.  I mean, it's never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there's two issues here. One is that the other big bigger real issue is are there actually no women?  But do we know that there are no women? I know there's there women in the marketing department at Apple.  Maybe they don't have any clout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I haven't been there in a while long enough to know. I mean, Katie Cotton used to run the PR.  Katie Cotton is still there.  She's still there? I used to work with her. That's how long she's been there.  Yeah.  Yeah, but you know, it's one thing to work there. It's another to have any real input that someone listens to you.  That's the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Were there any women on stage at that event?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When is Apple? I ask you, everybody out there who loves Apple, including me, when have you seen a woman on stage for Apple? Never.  You never do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've seen her before Apple, but a partner was on stage.  Which partner?  Her name. She was terrible, by the way. That's why I remember her.  She was with Sprinter, one of the other people, and she was a partner when the iPhone announcement.  It's just sad. It's just sad.  But that's one woman in four years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's pathetic. I don't know if there's ever been a senior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Roz Ho. Thank you. It was Roz Ho.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When has there been a senior woman executive at the top?  She was with Microsoft business here.  At Apple. Other than, well, I guess PR. I mean, Katie's pretty high.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who will you see quite a few?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Marissa Meyer would never have allowed this.  Marissa Meyer, start with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It would have occurred to her.  Marissa Meyer would have stopped this dead, I'm sure.  She's probably laughing.  This is just my prediction. I would love to ask her about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's probably laughing. But it's just the name. Come on. Right? I mean, it's just the name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's just the name. I'll totally get over it. Yeah. And I'm not going to... We don't ever have to talk about it again.  But, Gina, you're going to call it your tablet or something else?  I mean, when I write about it, I call it the iPad because when people Google the iPad,  I want them to find the right things on my site.  But it's just one of those things where I just think it's important.  There are a lot of jokes and people are saying, well, it's not that bad. It looks like...  You made the right point, Gina. That is the point.  That's the point. And so I'm over it. And maybe we will get used to it.  Maybe I won't ever think about it again. But for right now, it really felt like, wow, this is a really big mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And my wife and daughter who are not in the tech industry and don't really care about it had that immediate reaction as well.  That's what they're trying to sell it to. Yeah. It's going to be a universal reaction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, pretty much. It's a pretty big strange thing.  What else? I could talk about the iPad forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Jeff doesn't have a number, but Jeff was. In lieu of a number,  Jeff was going to take us downstairs to see the party. You want to do that?  No way. Yeah, let's try it. He's on a laptop.  Jeff. The big gala is going on.  I keep talking while I'm walking. He's missing the big Davos gala right now.  Is Angelina Jolie down there? I'm sure she is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, there are no stars this year. No stars? Not even Robert Scoble?  No stars. No. Charlie Rose, I think, is probably the biggest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, he's a star. That's pretty much it. He's a star.  This is cool. There's an adjective that goes into that name.  This is... Yes. I know the word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I may have dropped out earlier at Yale, but I know the word.  You're smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we could do every show walking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know. I love this. It's really cool. I love that. Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is something you cannot do. This is what you're missing people

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  by not running a Fortune 100 company, if that's not what you're missing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or being a blogger. Jeff's here as a blogger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're so dressed up, Jeff. Okay, I'm going downstairs in a second.  I'm still adjusting to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I could take you by the YouTube booth.  Here is the South African Schwag we're going to get.  It's a 2GIG thumb drive.  I don't know what that has for South Africa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, there'll be press materials on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going down the stairs  into the main conference room,  trying not to fall on my ass doing so.  Okay, here we are  in the main party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  We're on the internet. Wow, we're on the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're from South Africa, yeah?  What's your name?  Tibisu. So you're on a podcast called

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This Week in Google. Jeff, you're going to have to hold the microphone up to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we can't hear him. Unfortunately, we can't really hear him.  Thank you very much. We're three of us to party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's an ice sculpture of an Ibex, I think.  How white is the party, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can't hear you.  She wants to know how white the party was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How white is the party?  Here's a gentleman painting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's pretty.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  You want me to go into the hip room where the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  rock music is? Yeah, let's see if you can find  Eric or Sergi or Larry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know what I want, Jeff? Let's have some fun.  Please find a venture capitalist or a very leading politician  and make them dance with you for us, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was video of Bill Gates dancing.  That's awesome. It was pretty funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I want to see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've danced with Bill Gates. He does the white man's underbite.  You've danced with Bill Gates?  Next to him. Parallel dancing.  I wasn't holding him.  You want too much manly affection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We just lost Jeff's connection.  Leo, I would have paid a lot of money to see you dancing  in parallel next to Bill Gates.  I'm getting such pleasure from thinking about that.  Can I show you? This is how he dances.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do it. No way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is totally the white guy's overbite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Totally.  You had his butt stuck out.  I think there's new video of him dancing.  I remember seeing this on the internet recently.  It was at Sundance.  He's a philanthropist now.  Probably couldn't get an invite to Davos.  I want to find Bill Gates dancing.  Gina, can I ask you a question?  How do you feel about how much people in this

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Twitter army like you?  They adore you.  It's not in this kind of gross, you're a pinup girl.  They have mad respect for you.  I feel like I can never measure up to you.  I know that.  That is very sweet.  I'm deeply, deeply honored and privileged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The feeling is mutual.  Everybody loves everybody here.  Let me ask you a question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If Twitter said, we're going to have you be in this,  Vanity Fair said we're going to do this article,  will you compose naked in a raincoat and high heels?  That's what you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Vanity Fair would never.  Nice. Bill Gates dancing on screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's fantastic.  It looks like he's playing air guitar.  I can assure you, Vanity Fair will never ask me

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to get naked into a raincoat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did they do that to somebody else recently?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I saw that in Tummelvision.  They did a piece a couple of weeks ago.  They picked a bunch of women with large follower numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a weight ceiling on that, which I am well above.  To be quite honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought that was completely horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It caused this big response in the social media blogging world.  I try not to dip into too much.  It was kind of weird.  It was a very disparaging piece about Twitter,  the platform in general.  People talk, you know, the same old thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's Vanity Fair.  What did you expect? Deep thought?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Then they had a larger piece on...  Oh, God, who was it the next week?  Let it not be Ashton Kutcher.  Kevin Rose?  I'm sure.  There we go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm back. I'm in the YouTube booth.  Sorry, the Wi-Fi ended on the way to the hit party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See any finger knot?  Yeah, we got a great view.  This is Jeff Jarvis in Davos, Switzerland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now I'm in a chair that swivels so I can make you all...  I'm getting sick!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is how James Cameron did Titanic, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is great.  You're taping something that's going to be on YouTube eventually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Jeff Jarvis dances.  Bite your lower lip and you got it made.  We're going to wrap this up with our usual tip of the week  and tool of the week.  We won't do number of the week because Jeff...  Got a party instead.  That's right.  Although I think I bookmarked something that I thought you might use for a number.  Let me see if I can find that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't remember off the top of my head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina, what's your tip of the week?  Okay, my tip this week...  I'm giving this a little blind because I haven't used an iPhone in a while,  but my tip this week is for Google Voice users who are using the new web app on the iPhone.  I had Greg from DC wrote me and said  that a really good thing to do with the Google Voice web app  is that you can actually bookmark contacts  and put them on your iPhone's home screen.  That gives you access if you want to search for a contact from your quick search box  or if there are certain people you call over and over with Google Voice.  Since it's a web app and not a native app,  it's not integrated with your contacts on your iPhone.  But if you bookmark a contact, each contact has a permalink.  You can just tap that person and initiate a call through Google Voice easily.  So thanks to Greg for sending that one in.  I hope someone will correct me if that doesn't work as advertised.  That's great though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That gives you like 90% of the functionality you'd want to get in a Google Voice app.  It'd be nice to have my voicemail and all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the Chrome extension?  No, it's for an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  On the iPhone, you can just add it to your home screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was it Google that did this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, this is just the Google.com slash Voice.  It's just the web app.  If you visited on the iPhone, it's a brand new overhauled interface that they just launched this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fantastic.  They're suggesting in the chat room that a number for Jeff would be 270.  That's how much it costs, according to one Wall Street analyst, to build an iPad.  Thank you, chat room.  That's a good number.  It's a profit built into each and every one.  I find that a little hard to believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll see the tear down soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't forget there's development money that went into the chip.  Right, good point.  All the money they spent coming up with the name, that was expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That branding guy, boy, he cost a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait until you find out that it was a woman who did it.  That would be a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  To be honest, there are always people who will work against their own interests.  I know in Hollywood I worked with plenty of women who were happy to advocate tarting stuff up in bizarre ways.  It's possible a woman theoretically could have done it in an odd way.  I think, by the way, the use of the word tarting is offensive to tarts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you cut that out?  Sorry, strawberries are green.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here's another number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One more number. This is from Eric Schmidt.  It comes from an article in the City Herald University of London.  The prospect that Google's business in China might not reach its fifth birthday must be particularly difficult for Eric Schmidt.  As Google's chief executive, he claimed to have, and here's our number, 5,000 years of patience for Google's business in China.  That's about as long as China's been around.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A couple of numbers there.  My tip is a Google Friend Connect tip.  I use Friend Connect on my blog. I think it's kind of cool.  In fact, I'll show you my blog at leoville.com.  It allows people to sign up and become your friends, I guess.  It adds some social to a blog.  It's a little widget you can put on your blog.  I have 1,100 members of the blog.  You can sign in and so forth and you get avatars.  But here's a new feature.  I should sign in because it'll show it on my blog.  It also now allows you...  Oh, don't look. I'm going to enter my password.  You didn't actually have to look away. That's okay.  Heather looked away. I thought that was very sweet of you.  So now, if you go to your blog and you have Google Friend Connect on it, it says,  Find out more about your visitors' interests.  Perhaps not the best language Google should have used,  but what it is is a poll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like that they didn't assume they're your friends. That's kind of nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can now add a poll gadget to your Google Friend Connect.  This is kind of nice.  Basically, just by embedding Google's Friend Connect into my blog,  I now have the ability to add polls.  I can ask them all sorts of stuff.  I can say, what's your gender? Do you like the name iPad?  They resell this data to everyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh. I'm sure they do.  Never mind. Forget I mentioned it.  I'm sorry. I spent some time with a friend who does all this SEO crap the other day.  You think they really use that?  They sell not only stuff based on what people purchase or click through on your site.  There's a lot of tracking the cookies of who comes through and then running crazy algorithms.  Who knows if it works? I don't know.  They think they're finding out trends of who goes where.  There's multiple levels of sales of so-called marketing traffic data.  I'm sorry. That's the first thing that came to my mind.  I like the poll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is what, for instance, if I just added that poll.  Congratulations, Leah. When they join you've just joined Leahville.  Let others know more about you. What's your gender?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you want to be PC, you add another dot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I should add a third.  Pick your own.  Your choice. Unknown.  Yeah. Take your choice. Self-destruct.  That's three, four, nine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There are so many genders at this point, Leah, when I perform in the alphabet community.  It's so confusing.  I just let everyone pick their own.  Pick your own. You know what?  You could be a Cylon. You could be whatever you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're postmodern here. We don't have gender.  You may not have one.  Who may? Genders.  You may have multiple.  Arcane concept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You may be trans-species.  Cylon is a good choice.  Cylon. I'm Cylon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why not?  Okay, you know what?  Put that as an option.  I'm adding Cylon to my poll. That's fantastic.  But of course, you know, when you do that, 99% pick Cylon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can they get to add their own option in there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sure. Sure. I can add all sorts of stuff.  Oh, you mean they add their own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, like, I like that in polls where you can give an option for people to input more descriptively.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. It's actually, I was very impressed.  It's a very sophisticated polling widget that actually gives you more capabilities than,  so you can add text, paragraph text, multiple choice, checks boxes, choose from a list.  It's a very flexible polling widget.  I really like it.  You know, it's nice.  So that's my tool of the week if you want to add polls and you're already using Google Friend Connect,  or if you're not using Google Friend Connect, you might want to take a look at it.  This way all your friends' information will be known by Google.  Why should they have any more privacy than you do?  Think about it.  Gina Trapani is the creator of SmarterWear.org.  That's her blog, but she also is seen in many other venues,  including, of course, the Harvard Business Review.  We won't hold that against her, Heather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She's the coolest thing on the Harvard Business Review.  Lifehacker. Yeah, she is.  Pretty much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And in a raincoat or out, we all love her.  Thank you, Leo.  CompleteWaveGuide.com is where the book is.  Jeff Jarvis did yeoman duty, taking us to Davos, Switzerland in the middle of the night.  Yeah, everybody's tired. Everybody's gone home.  The YouTube booth's empty.  Yep.  There's nobody there.  We'll go ahead and flip the switch and just do something funny.  Do something weird on YouTube.  They left the server up.  Thank you, Jeff.  Jeff's blog is BuzzMachine.com.  That's where you can see the full article on what he learned with his special,  exclusive, super duper meeting with Erica Schmidt and Marissa Meyer and the gang.  Heather Gold is a performer, a comic, and the host of Tummelvision here on the Twitter network.  Is that every Tuesday night?  Every Thursday at 7.  Thursday night.  At 7 p.m. Pacific.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Pacific Standard Time.  And I actually have some kind of, are we allowed to plug at this point?  I just plugged them.  I have a, I'm doing a couple of workshops, one here in San Francisco.  We've added a second one the 5th of February, and there's one March 27th in New York.  Unpresenting.com, Speaking Skills, how to tumble, how to engage the room,  how to be yourself in public and feel good about that.  Unpresenting, you call it.  Yes, because half of it's unlearning.  That's great.  The bad crap that people think they have to do to get listened to.  Don't try to be Steve Jobs.  Just be you in public, a little better.  It works really well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have, I've been reading a book called The Presentation Secrets of Steve Jobs,  and I realize I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I totally had an argument with that guy on Twitter.  I think it's a giant mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's got good information, but you can't be Steve Jobs.  No, you can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's a waste of time.  Be you.  He also cannot be you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why assume that you don't, you may have some massively important thing.  You certainly wouldn't have called your device the iPad, so you've got one up on him.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you, Heather.  Great to have you.  We'll catch you Thursday night on Tummel Vision on live.twit.tv.  Tummel with M's.  I know it's a new weird word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We explain it on the show.  It makes sense.  It's a Yiddish word.  I like it.  It's a Yiddish word.  It means the act of social engagement, someone who mixes things up.  Yeah, and that's your expertise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, and we have lots of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We had Kathy Sierra last week.  She was awesome.  She's great.  I think she's fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I have next week, I have to say, I'm pretty excited.

Transcript:  Allie Willis, who is an amazing songwriter.  She wrote Earth, Wind & Fire's Boogie Wonderland, September.  She wrote Patron Dance.  She wrote the Color Purple soundtrack.  She wrote the theme song to Friends, and she's an incredible artist in multiple levels  and has been doing online community stuff since super early days.  She's a super infamous party thrower.  I'm going to talk to her a lot about parties, and I think I'm going to go to one later this month.  So she's pretty cool.  I would tune in for her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All this Facebook stuff really is just throwing a party, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, how do you get everyone out to have a really good time?  Very much.  Very much that's what you want, right?  You want people involved and engaged.  Yeah, well, that'll be fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't wait to see that.  She's got a cool site, too.  She's got incredible stuff.
