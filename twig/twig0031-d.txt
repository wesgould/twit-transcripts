Transcript:  This Week in Google.  The show that covers the Google verse and all the cloud stuff that's all around us every day.  Joining us, I couldn't think of two better people to have on the show as regulars.  The one, the only Jeff Jarvis from BuzzMachine.com.  A great observer of all things Google.  The author of What Would Google Do?  But also of the new journalism, the new press.  He is a professor of journalism at the City University of New York.  And it's so good to have you here, Jeff, as always.  That's the boring stuff.  That's the boring stuff.  The good stuff is the book What Would Google Do?  What You Must All Buy Now.  Gina Trapani's book is The Complete Guide to Google Wave at completewaveguide.com.  She's also the creator of Life Hacker.  Still blogs there and on her own site, smarterware.org.  And is currently working to create transparency in government.  Right?  Yes, sir.  Is it Escape Labs?  What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Expert Labs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Expert Labs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  ExpertLabs.org.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know why.  Escape left to mind there, but it did, didn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the big...  Governor Patterson of New York has been using its services this week.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No kidding.  What's happening?  So he's decided not to run.  Even though all the rumors were false, he's decided not to run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  New York politics are beyond me.  I tell you.  Jersey's enough for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  By the way, Gina is a Jersey girl today.  And that's why she's so orange.  She's got the tan and a can.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  Asbury Park, baby.  She was born to run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Biggest story, I guess, of the week is this weird case in Italy where the Italian courts  said three or four Google executives were guilty of wrongdoing in a video that was posted  on YouTube, up on YouTube for two months of a...  Now, I've seen reports that the kid was Down syndrome, another one that he was autistic.  I don't know which, but of a kid being teased, taunted on this video.  The video was up for two months.  Google says the Italian police contacted us.  We pulled it down within two hours.  However, prosecutors still went after these executives and they're found guilty of not  pulling it down.  And the issue...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Of violating privacy.  It was a privacy law violation in Italy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And of course, the issue is, is Google responsible for the content posted as a publisher would  be or are they a common carrier and merely as they are in the States required to pull  it down if there's a complaint?  What does this mean, Jeff?  I mean, how can Google...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's dangerous for the internet.  Yeah.  I think we're going to find ourselves in a position of being ruled by the lowest common  denominator.  And in the case of Italy, it's this law.  In the case of China, it's their censorship.  In the case of the UK, it's their libel tourism.  Because you can be at risk.  An American executive is now at risk for what someone in Italy did on a service.  And it's patently absurd that Google should be expected to review all content before putting  it up.  Well, I did a little back of envelope calculation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I hope I'm not stealing your number, but 20 hours...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't have one yet.  20 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Good.  But before the show's over, I'm sure you will.  20 hours of video uploaded every minute to Google.  So, I calculated that you would have to have three shifts of 10,000 employees each looking  at video pretty much nonstop.  That's 30,000 new employees just right now.  And then, of course, next month it'll be more and more after that, more after that, just  to review every bit of video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And now add Blogger into that.  It's not doable.  Leo, the comments on your site and Buzz and anything that's public, it is absurd.  I mean, if I go to Buzz and say that Leo Laporte wears strange sweaters, then I'm now libel  in Italy.  Because that's a private matter, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Very.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What really happens here is that the internet itself is at risk.  This is an ignorant view.  These judges are not the only ones in the world to hold it.  They're thinking of the internet as a medium.  Right.  It was Doc Searles who taught me that the internet is not.  It's a place.  It's a place where people connect and do things, and it is public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But let me play a little bit of a devil's advocate here.  Unlike, say, the phone company, don't they benefit?  I mean, isn't YouTube making money on these posts?  So in some ways, aren't they more like a publisher in the sense that they put ads next to these  posts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I don't think that...  A, by the way, it was Google Video, not YouTube.  Oh, okay.  It wasn't YouTube.  And I don't think they have any ads there.  No.  So I think the answer to that essentially is no.  And the phone company makes money on our phone calls.  If I get a lot of people to call me by doing something scammy, then they're going to make  money along the way.  Right.  So I don't think that works.  The other argument is that Google...  This video went, unfortunately, for the sake of mankind, had a lot of traffic for those  two months before Google was notified and given a takedown notice.  And so some would argue that Google should have known that and should have just taken it down.  But that's a short step from that to having to monitor and vet all content that's put up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I thought...  But it was up for two months.  I thought that there were complaints about the video before the Italian police contact.  I thought that was the issue that Google has been contacted and they were asked to  take the video down, but they didn't for a while.  Isn't the two months really the issue?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a failure of...  Customer service.  Yeah, basically.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  That's a customer service issue.  I mean, let's...  I mean, I totally agree with what you're saying, Jeff.  I think everyone knows...  I don't know.  I'm going to assume that everyone knows that checking everything the minute that it goes  up is insane.  But I do think there may be an issue of responsiveness on their end.  If someone did contact them about this video, which it sounds like someone did, that they  should have responded sooner, unless they have a special, oh my God, it's the police  filter.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's such a chilling effect on a company that its executives could go to jail for something  like this.  That's the real problem here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that it can happen in another country.  And so do we all get to the point of saying...  Every company around now, lawyers and companies all around the world now are saying, no, more  liability.  Are you sure you want to allow communication with the masses?  The masses do dastardly things once in a while.  You'd better cut off all that communication, all that conversation, the entire benefit  of the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The title of your blog post is Italy Endangers the Web.  It's not a danger to Google.  It's not a danger to executives.  It's a danger to us, to the web, to an open web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In the UK, they have what's called libel tourism.  If you're a dastardly sheik somewhere in the world, and this has happened, and someone  writes about you, and just once it's read in the UK, you can be sued under the UK's  rather, I think, backward libel laws that you are presumed guilty until you prove yourself  innocent.  And it's a way to harass you, and it's a way to chill speech.  The Italian move is a way to chill speech.  You also have Berlusconi trying to control the internet and keep people from saying nasty  things about him, and there are a few nasty things to say.  Then you add in Iran and China, and it becomes a real problem for the internet around the  world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What do you have?  You have a Balkanized web where there's a little fiefdom everywhere, or do you have  just the lowest common denominator web?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's my fear, it's the lowest common denominator.  Some lawyer somewhere will say to some boss,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can't do that because it's illegal in Estonia.  Right, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  An executive who will go unnamed because he works somewhere near that company called it  the axis of medieval.  And I think that's what we're getting here is people who don't understand the essence  of the web.  This is the problem not just in this, it's a problem that I have with newspapers, that  they don't understand the economics and structure of the web, and they want to recreate their  old world here.  And this is a case where, I think you're right Leo, they're making a parallel to publishers  because they think that the internet is a medium and is controlled and can be controlled.  Instead, as you said, it's a common carrier or it's a public square.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You point out that we have section 230 in the US, which says,  Quote, no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher  or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.  It's the so-called safe haven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was incredibly forward thinking of Congress of all people to see that and to see that  if we did not have that protection, we wouldn't have speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It protects bloggers, it protects YouTube, it protects all of us, it protects me, it  protects me as a podcaster.  Well, wait a minute, no, it doesn't, I'm a publisher.  But it protects me in my forums.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the comments, the comments, no, the things that others put up on your site, you're  not liable for, or you have a safe haven regarding.  The Wikipedia page for section 230 is very good, it goes into the case law since, and  it's not perfect, but it's, and I argue that's the first amendment of the web.  Somebody came in, I forget who it was, to my comments and said, well, no, it protects  the service provider, it doesn't protect the speaker.  True, but without it, we'd have no speech.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You have to be able to be indemnified as a content provider or you're not going to put  any content up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're not going to allow others to do so, and there goes conversation.  And we're back to our medieval world of a centralized world where institutions and brands  control everything, which is exactly what Mr. Berlusconi wants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Mr. Murdoch.  Yes.  As long as we're talking.  You suggest that we have something like John Perry Barlow's declaration of independence  for cyberspace.  Which I think is a wonderful piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was 1999 written in Davos, there I did it again.  And I recommend it highly.  I think Leo, you should do a dramatic reading of it with full verve and vigor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually, John Perry Barlow should do it.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, could with musical background from the dead, though that would make it too mellow,  I think.  And Rebecca McKinnon, a really respected blogger and journalist about China, was arguing after  the Chinese situation with Google that we needed a constitution of the web.  And I fear that a little bit in that it could codify too much under law and treaty, which  is not what we want.  If you listen to Barlow, but I do think we need a statement of rights, a bill of rights  for the Internet.  And we need to use that as the standard and use that as the explanation of the law.  And use that as the explanation of what this is.  And it doesn't come from governments, doesn't come from institutions, it should come from  us, the users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I might do a dramatic read.  This is...  It's really quite amazing.  Barlow, who is a writer, lyricist for the Grateful Dead, really has a way with words.  Listen to the first paragraph.  Governments of the industrial world, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from cyberspace,  the new home of the mind.  On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone.  You're not welcome among us.  You have no sovereignty where we gather.  Boy, I wish it were true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's the expectation we have and we need to say it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, no, you're right.  Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed.  You have neither solicited nor received ours.  We didn't invite you.  You do not know us, nor do you know our world.  You know, I think it's really...  There is a divide, and I've observed this and I've talked about this with the friends of mine,  between...  It's even between people.  Sometimes, Amber MacArthur and I call the rest of the world the straights.  Where they just...  You know what I mean?  You know what I mean?  They're the weary giants of flesh and steel.  They're the old school folks who don't get what's going on in the new media,  in social media, in cyberspace, and kind of interpret it through their very limited perception from the past.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like straights as in normals or straights as in readers?  Well, not readers.  We're talking normals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're talking normals because there are plenty of gay straights in this case.  But no, I mean, yeah, there are people who...  But it's like that.  It's that same division of people who get it and don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I used to just say, they don't get it.  I tried to stop myself from using that phrase, don't get it.  And it's true.  They don't.  But in my little boring world of news and media, I came to see that we have a responsibility to educate them.  Because not knowing it is what is...  Not understanding this world, not getting it, is what is leading to the destruction of newspapers coast to coast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and frankly, I agree with you, but often I just want to throw up my hands and say,  you guys don't get it.  I have.  I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I talked to an editor, the former editor of a prestigious paper who left in December to do foundation work.  And so she's of the old world.  And she shocked me when she said, you know, I'm getting to think that we should just let the...  The sooner the old institutions die, the better.  Right.  I think I used to say that all the time, and I don't even talk that way.  But I think that part of the question we have here is, do we have the faith that the genus of the world,  the Zuckerbergs, the Larrys and Sergays, will take over the world soon enough?  And we shouldn't worry about the dinosaurs.  They'll huddle together against the cold wind of the Internet and perish?  Or do we, who get it, we think, have some obligation to try to shake them and make them understand it?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, and somebody's pointing out in the chat room, I think this is true, that geeks sometimes abrogate our rights  and our interests by not being political.  You know, we don't...  Larry Lesig's great because, you know, we were talking with Larry about, you know,  the fight over intellectual property and the commons and all of this and this horrible copyright,  infinite copyright law and stuff.  And the temptation for geeks is just break the law.  Say, screw it. We can get around it. We can break it.  And he says, no, you can't break the law. He says, you have to change the law.  The only tenable position is to say, look, you know, if you care, don't break it, change it.  And this is almost the debate between Gandhi and Malcolm X, you know.  Yeah.  Do you... Is it civil disobedience? Is it passive resistance? Do you get political?  What do you do? And I think we have to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do we recognize, as in the Google China case, that the Internet is a new land?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there is an effort to colonize it. And the King of Spain is trying to make it his.  Right. Get out of our cyberspace.  We're trying to make it hers. And we're trying to say, no, it's the people's.  Do we need a, you know, a meeting on a hot day in Philadelphia to hammer out our Bill of Rights?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is what John Perry Barlow says.  These increasingly hostile and colonial measures to place us in the same position  as those previous lovers of freedom and self-determination  who had to reject the authorities of distant, uninformed powers.  We must declare our virtual selves immune to your sovereignty  even as we continue to consent to your rule over our bodies.  We will spread ourselves across the planet so that no one can arrest our thoughts.  This is 1996. It's really prophetic.  1996? When? 96?  Wow.  It's totally prophetic.  Yeah.  We will create a civilization of the mind in cyberspace.  May it be more humane and fair than the world your governments have made before.  And you could say, well, it's a little Pollyanna-ish. It's a little...  But you know what? I also think it's true.  Yep.  And it's something we do need to fight for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a standard we need to hold up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you think that this is going to be gradual an evolution  and that, you know, the older people who don't get it, the norms kind of fade away?  Or is it going to come to conflict?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's going to come to conflict. That's what I've seen in the news business.  The way I describe it is the Internet is an avalanche.  It starts at the top of the hill closest to those things that are most like it.  And that's medium. That's why we think it's a medium, though it's not.  Because the business is similar, the interaction is similar.  So look at newspapers as the Canary in the coal mine.  That's what's happened here. And there's a lot of hostility.  There's a lot of argument. There's efforts to go change laws.  You know, in Europe we see the Germans trying to change copyright law.  We see that happening in the U.S. movements do that.  So there are others trying to change the law, by the way, and make them worse.  So what the hell are we doing? We're sitting by and we're not doing anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think we need a manifesto or something. We need to get off our dofs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You don't think doing shows like this and blogging and talking about these things  just the way that we do is doing something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it is. But is it enough?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are we reaching the right people? We're preaching to the choir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're preaching to the choir somewhat.  I mean, if you listen to this show, you must be somebody who gets it.  True.  I have to say, I talk on the radio, which reaches a much broader, more diverse audience,  all the time about this stuff. And you have to be a little subversive and subtle.  You can't exactly wave a pitchfork.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, but there you go. You're doing a radio show, a mainstream radio show.  I think it's important to have our little geek enclaves, like shows like this.  Yeah, because it's a refuge. It's a refuge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, it is.  This is where we conspire. This is the base.  Exactly. It is where we conspire.  This is our cell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo has been giving us the mimeograph machine.  But now we have to go to his morning show coming soon from New York and start to speak to a different audience.  Hey, chat room, chat room, does anybody here disagree with what we're saying right now?  Of course not.  Or are you all the choir?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're all the choir, aren't they?  Yeah.  I mean, they're in the chat room for crying out loud, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but they're going off into the world. They're all, you know, they're normal companies and they'll spread the word there. We're infecting them.  There you go. So that's exactly the message.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's give them the tools to better infect. Let's give them the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that was Larry's message is don't break the law, change the law.  And so, you know, geeks don't want to be political. We don't want to get involved, but we've got to.  Otherwise, that's I think probably the thing that is missing is a sense of urgency.  And maybe this Italian court decision will help a little bit in that sense of urgency.  It isn't a given that we will have an open Internet forever. It could be destroyed easily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it could be used to change other pieces of law, again, like copyright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it is. Look at this crazy Acta treaty. I mean, they're trying to get this stuff by us.  So you don't get it. You seem more optimistic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess I am. I think I think I just I don't know. Maybe I'm just too young. I don't know.  That just seems crazy. I'm like, that's never going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo and me, it's bringing out our old children of the 60s thing. We're going to grow our hair.  Right. It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it gives us it gives me hope anyway that the young person like Gina sees this transformation happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe I'm totally naive, though, and I feel you know, and I just haven't, you know, live.  I haven't seen. I just I don't know. That seems like it just it'll never happen.  But you're absolutely right. And I'm actually feeling a lot.  I'm sitting here feeling a lot of guilt for not working more to change the law and breaking it more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No guilt, no guilt, no guilt, no guilt.  It's an important point. It's an important point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's something I think that we should probably all take the heart, although it does seem hard to believe.  I mean, you know, I read Jeff's piece about Italy and I and I agree, but I guess I felt like I don't know.  Maybe I'm kind of a nerd about this, but I kind of felt like, well, maybe there just needs to be better procedures for,  you know, complaining about content and, you know, helping Google make that decision faster.  The two moms. I think that's true, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In fact, I think the way to do that is crowdsourcing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, absolutely. I agree.  I agree.  I'm sorry, Gina, go ahead.  No, I mean, I think Google's biggest mistake was just not being more responsive or not having the controls to bubble up the stuff  that's upsetting people that people are complaining about.  I'm sure people complained about that video and that video got a lot of views.  So Google should have just been more responsive to that stuff.  So that's the only thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If the standard is it offends someone, then we're in the same boat because everything will offend someone somewhere.  And so Google would prefer to have an official notice of takedown so that it can say to its audience,  that's why I took it down, not just because we didn't like it, because then they're in the boat of saying,  why did you take this down, not that down?  Gee, you took it down when it was the Down syndrome kid, but it wasn't when you had just the geeky kid.  You know, what gives here, Google?  And they're in a difficult position then.  I think that their audience could help, not in the sense of if just someone complains,  because then you're in Howard Sternland.  You're in the world of three people complaining about a show and the FCC dorks, giving it a big fine.  But I think you could have a trusted jury of Google users who could alert Google.  I think they're in the same boat when it comes to advertising problems.  When they decree a site, a spam site, and the site says, no, this is our service, we're an aggregator,  Google finds itself in a position, I think it's the one greatest weakness they have,  because they have to act like a monopolist then.  They just decide on their own.  And I think it'd be better off to have a jury of those advertisers' peers decide what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely, I think that's a good solution, you know, partially a solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is something we're going to be talking about a lot for a long time,  but I'm going to take a break right now.  We're going to come back and talk about more assaults on our freedom from our own people.  Facebook tries to patent the news feed, actually succeeds.  And apparently there's some additional patents coming down the pipe from Facebook that are even worse.  China...  What is up with that?  Yeah, what is? Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're going to patent getting laid from the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They might have a case there.  That's what they should be patenting, not the news feed.  Also, antitrust accusations against Google and Street View in trouble in Europe.  China widens its net censorship.  And now the number of companies who were hacked in that China Google hack has widened to a bigger number.  I don't want to say any numbers in case it's Jeff's.  I don't have an automatic use of this information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, you now have 60 seconds to get a number.  And Gina, you get a tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And who's going to be the first to get a number?  You get a tip. And who's going to help me get a tool?  I'll let the chat room do that.  But first I want to tell you about a great tool if you are in the support business.  It's GoToAssist Express from the folks at Citrix.  Now you know Citrix, it's the name in enterprise for remote access.  They licensed their remote access technology to Microsoft.  That was the beginning of RDP.  They've created really great consumer versions of their remote access with GoToMyPC and GoToMeeting.  And now GoToAssist.  GoToAssist is for the IT or support professional, the person who has to support software,  maybe even the alpha geek in a family or a group,  the person who gets called upon to fix her friends and relatives' computers.  This is a program that will make it so much easier for you.  If you've ever had to do this on the phone,  just the ability to reach out into somebody's computer,  however far away they are and fix it is just a blessing.  You don't have to have it pre-installed on Aunt Matilda's computer.  Uncle Bertie, you just send him an email saying,  Bert, click this link or go to gotoassist.com,  start a session and I can get into your system and I can fix it.  And not only that, I will know what operating system you're running,  what security software you're running, what's running in the background.  If you're a pro, you can have eight sessions at once.  That means you can start a scan and are installing one and move to the next, the next, the next, no wasted time.  You can do unattended sessions.  Once you get it set up, you know, then anytime you want to get in there,  if they give you permission, obviously, for security reasons, you can fix it.  Or even like if you've got like a malware bytes or a reg hack or whatever you want to copy it over, you can do that.  This thing is made for the support professional.  You could try it free for 30 days.  I want you to try it now by going to gotoassist.com slash twig.  That's G-O-T-O-Assist.com slash T-W-I-G.  Go to Assist from Citrix.  It is a great product.  We thank them for their support of this week in Google.  Hey, guys, I have to get you.  I got you something and you're going to get in the mail in the next couple of days.  But do you mind if I show you ahead of time?  Not at all.  I got to go over here and get it.  I hate surprises.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, this looks good, Jeff.  This looks really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I saved one for myself and I thought, you know, we're going to do this week in Google at South by Southwest.  And I thought that and so I sent you all of these and you have to bring it.  It is an official Google snuggly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nice.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  You all get one.  Very soft, very plush, very down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Couldn't bring myself to buy because I was embarrassed but always desperately wanted.  My wife is going to be thrilled about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I almost sent you two, Gina, then I thought, well, I should send then I have to send everybody two.  So if you want more.  Oh, my wife wouldn't wear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guarantee you, Leo.  You know, that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no, she's just going to make fun of me when I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Gina, it's big enough for two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, it's big enough for a house, frankly.  It's huge.  But there you go.  And it says Google right on it.  There it is on the pocket.  Special pocket.  Just the right size and even has a little just the right size for maybe an iPhone or an iPad right in there.  Or a Dexys wand.  Oh, yeah.  Wait a minute.  What am I saying?  That's your that's the Nexus one pocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So we have bonus points for walking around South by Southwest in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, you can't walk in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like it will look like Google Monks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK, OK, maybe we totally will, especially if you go, you put your because the sleeves.  Oh, Google, Larry and Sergey and every girl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is fantastic.  Shall be open to know even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Isn't it great?  Oh, I just so Google sells these.  I saw them online at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  More evidence of how they ruin society.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They don't call it a slanket or a what's the other slanket snuggly.  Right.  They don't call it that snuggie.  Whatever it is.  They just say it's a complete.  Yeah, I don't know.  I guess they don't want to infringe on anybody's trademarks, but it's so soft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I've never said it on fire.  I suspected poison you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Are you kidding?  No open flame near this thing.  You'll go up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And if you and if you wear it and have your laptop in your lap and you search Google,  your search results come across twice as fast.  Twice as fast.  I think we've got to rehearse the chant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gina's idea that we're amongst we got to we got to come up with a grand chance to do  it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, Larry, Larry, Harry.  We will.  We will come up with some.  I'll write some.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Italy is bad.  China is bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Algorithms first.  People later.  Oh, Python.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We love you.  So, yeah, I thought we'd have fun in South by Southwest.  We can all wear our Google slankets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thanks, Leo.  I'm excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, Gina, I'm going to give you a chance to retract your swipe recommendation from last  week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, I am.  I'm going to retract my swipe recommendation.  I know.  I know.  I like swipe very much.  And I posted about the the beta, the leaked copy.  It wasn't even a beta.  It was a leaked copy.  And I should have said this.  I should emphasize this a little more last week.  I should have said that it was a leaked copy that wasn't coming.  It wasn't.  It's not in the market because the swipe team contacted me and said, hey, you know, we don't  have a downloadable version of swipe and that's intentional.  Their business model is OEM deals.  Only certain phones will ship with swipe.  So forget I ever said the word swipe.  And instead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I took it off immediately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, you know, it was good to actually be going to an Italian jail any minute.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it's good that you did that because they had never said this and nobody knew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't, you know, whatever their business model.  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wish them the best.  It's a strange business model because as people in your blog pointed out, we all want to buy one.  Right.  And they won't sell it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  So go into the Android market and search for Shapewriter.  Shapewriter.  And it is fully supported, downloadable Android keyboard replacement that does exactly what  that other program does.  You can, you know, swipe your finger across the keyboard to type words.  It actually offers dictionary suggestions the way that Android's default keyboard does,  which is which is super useful.  And it works just as well.  It's fully supported.  There's no weird errors.  You'll get updates through the market as usual.  So Shapewriter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is it basically the same thing where you just draw the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly the same functionality.  Yep.  Works really well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sorry, swipe.  Yeah.  Whoops.  Sorry.  Whoops.  They said our model is to our business model is OEM licensing.  Okay.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.  Okay.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's cool to say.  I mean, you know, it's their business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They can choose a business model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But as somebody pointed out in your comments in the comments on your blog, you got a product  people want.  People are downloading it illegally.  They're offering to pay it.  Pay for it.  They're saying we will buy it.  Please.  Proven marketplace.  And you say, no, you can't have it.  I'm glad I'm not investing in swipe.  That's all I can say.  But anyway, we apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Very glad to go after you, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She did nothing wrong.  She did nothing wrong.  And it wasn't clear that that was a, you know, a pirated version or anything.  It just was, you know, it was floating around.  I had it too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Geeks trying things and giving them feedback, which would be very valuable to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So in a way you gave them a chance to tell people that that's not what we're, you know,  that's not a legitimate version.  So there you go.  Yeah, there you go.  There you go.  And to find a better and to find a better one.  Shapewriter.  Yep.  Which I immediately installed.  Good, good, good.  So Facebook, I can't even say it with a straight face, patents the newsfeed.  So this is the patent they got on Tuesday for, quote, dynamically providing a newsfeed  about a user of a social network.  I mean, I guess you could say that they copied it from Twitter, but Twitter neglected to  patent it.  Thank you, Twitter.  They applied for the application in 2006, which by the way is before Twitter existed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the feed existed before Twitter, didn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You'd think that, I mean, a newsfeed, well, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, isn't a newsfeed a blog?  I mean, what are they trying to patent brevity?  Like I don't, I mean, isn't a feed of updates or inverse chronological order?  I mean, really at this point?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can't blame a company for trying to patent something that they think they created, but  I actually blame the patent office for not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For approving it?  For approving it.  But what is the point?  So you file a patent, why?  So you can sue other people, right?  I blame the company for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or so you can keep others from using it.  From harassing you, but in which case say so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And a lot of patents are in fact applied for that reason.  We have no intent of forcing people to license it or keeping people from using it.  We just, we want to make sure that there's no issue about us using it.  So here's the patent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, in September 2006 was the Führer over it.  And when did Twitter launch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Twitter, I signed up for Twitter December 2006, but they were around in, I think, late  summer or even summer 2006.  So they were around before then.  Which might have been why Zuckerberg et al filed the patent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In March 2006.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know.  That's right about the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what it says here, yeah.  Wiki answers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Answers.com.  That's right about the same time.  So here's the diagram in the patent.  Start generating news items, attaching informational links, attaching active links, limiting number  of viewers, assigning an order, displaying news items.  That's the patent.  That's the process that's patented right there.  I guess, you know, if it's very specific and that's kind of what they've got a patent for,  I guess that's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I'm looking at this article and there's a last graph that says, it appears this patent  surrounds implicit actions.  Right.  This means status updates, which is what Twitter is based on, are not part of this patent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In other words, because Twitter is explicit, it's kind of somebody did it, said wrote it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is about stories about the actions of a user's friend, friends, excuse me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's automatically generated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  So automatically generated sort of, it even like metadata, right?  So if you, so Leo, you friend someone else, I'll see that in my newsfeed, that kind of  thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay.  Okay.  I can give them that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I still wish they'd say that they're not going to try to hold onto it, but they're a company  that kind of does do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, is there anybody else who does that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, if you see what your friend, I don't use Netflix, but do you see what your friends  there are reading?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  The Netflix feed, you can subscribe to a friend's feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And the argument I make is that the winner in social will not be a service we all sign  up to because the internet is the social network.  Right.  And the winner is he or she who brings organization to that.  Right.  And so that's the risk of this one, I think, is that what you want is something that pulls  together in some algorithmically clever way and prioritizes for you stuff your friends  are doing on Facebook and Twitter and Netflix and Buzz and wherever.  Right.  That's what we need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I felt very bad yesterday, not yesterday, last week, because the show had ended and  I brought up demand media.  And we started, it was an incredible conversation, but Jeff, I knew you had to go to pizza.  So I cut it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I cut it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I cut it off.  I got a lot of heated mail from people saying, well, they were really fascinated by it.  And they said, this great conversation starts and you stop it.  But the real mistake I made was that I started it.  So we can continue it now.  And in fact, there's a very interesting article in b2bmemes.com that actually quotes Matt  Cutts talking last week on this week at Google about these content farms.  And what they took from the conversation that we had last week is that Google might in fact  want to rein this in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, Matt was not cleverly, because Matt is very smart and he was not explicit about  that.  But what he said was that they're going to try to get more links to original content,  original creation and have signals of quality.  So that's what you do is rewrite the 87th page about how to fix your toilet.  You shouldn't even if you have great SEO, that's gaming Google.  You shouldn't rise up.  You know, Bob Veal is magnificent masterpiece about fixing toilets should rise up because  it's original and high quality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you actually then blogged on Monday about this a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A little bit.  I also full disclosure here, I think I mentioned on the show or after the show last week that  I was asked to join in a advisory board of demand and I declined.  Passing up stock that probably will be worth something when they go to the IPO.  But you know, other things matter here.  And I don't do it as a condemnation of demand because my real problem here is that I think  demand media has some key insights that matter for everybody.  And I point that out and what that scene is positive.  So I don't want people to think that I'm saying tolerant or positive things out of financial  interest.  Right.  And the key insights for demand media are number one, that they listen to what the audience  wants and that's what they create.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which is not a bad thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it was it was such a ding moment for me when I consulted for about.com.  I saw them do that.  They check their search queries.  And right.  If they if they if they people ask a question for which they didn't have an answer, they  wrote the answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a formalized way of doing what a lot of media does, which is serve its audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  But we didn't do that in old media.  We just said, I can decide what you want and what you need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's one of the reasons I like to talk radio and I like doing a call in radio show because  you answer the questions people are asking.  So in a sense, that's demand media too, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  And the other thing they did is that they cut up the task of creating a piece of content  into 11 discrete pieces and job that out in the marketplace.  So they'll pay you 20 bucks to write that toilet page or make that toilet video.  And somebody else will copy edit it.  Somebody else will fact check it and so on and so forth.  The copy editor, I think, will make about two dollars and fifty cents for doing that.  Wow.  And people are up in arms about that.  And I understand that it's harsh, but welcome to capitalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If that's what people.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If there are people willing to do it.  Yeah.  But where I think demand is going to get hit.  And there's plenty who are somewhat like this.  You have associated content and sweet one on one where the writer decides what to write  still.  You have about dot com that has dedicated guides.  You have the upcoming seed at AOL, which is trying to figure out what it wants to be.  And though I think I saw somebody tweeted this week that there was an assignment on seed  to name the prettiest news anchor in your market.  That's improving the world, but fine.  So these are all different models.  And demand really took it to a new level.  But I think that what Matt said on the show last week is really, really, really important  because it's Google saying it's recognizing that they've got to find signals of quality  and creation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the key.  It's not about how cheap it is.  It's not about how it's generated.  It's about whether the content has quality and you want to surface the best quality content

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and it is Google's interest to do so.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You don't want to be fooled by SEO.  You want to have the best quality content surface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the more search becomes...  Go ahead, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was going to say on their European public policy blog, Google posted their three main  elements of their search philosophy.  And the first one is not surprisingly algorithmically generated results.  The second one is no query left behind.  And the third one is keep it simple.  So the no query left behind means that when they get complaints about one query not returning  good results, they don't go in and edit the results for that one query.  They make a generalized improvement that's supposed to improve an entire class of queries.  So what Matt's saying is like, yes, we know that these content farms may not have the  best quality content.  It's up to us to refine the algorithm to the place where it can figure out regardless of  who created it or how much it cost.  And actually, I love the last graph of this post.  The author pointed out that if you search for the words search engine on Google, the  first results are altavista, dogpile, web search, Bing, and ask.com.  So I mean, that's pretty amazing.  I mean, that's certainly an algorithm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, that goes to another issue for Google this week is that there have been there were  three complaints of antitrust put up against them, arguing that Google is favoring its  own stuff.  Well, name me a media site that doesn't promote its own stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you think that's why you find altavista, dogpile, Bing, and ask on this search page  is because Google's trying to avoid accusations of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, they seem to be using that.  Yeah, I mean, they're using that to prove like, hey, our algorithm is not biased.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, come on, though.  No, in fact, if you look at this result, it's like the worst possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And actually, the last sentence of that of that post is I guess I'd better get back  to work.  I would say those are crappy results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Those are not good results.  It almost is like Google bent over backwards to show the worst possible results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. So maybe they were using, you know, if you if you're a cynic, you think, well,  they set that up just so they can make that point.  But I don't know. I don't know.  They go to that trouble. I don't think I don't think God editor is there.  Controlling search results, they take they take a lot of pains to make sure that everyone  understands that it is an algorithm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I remember talking with Larry and Sergey back when Google was actually reaching out to  journalists because they wanted coverage or something, because they needed coverage.  Yeah, it must have been very early.  I remember going to a dinner.  PR PR people invited us to dinner in San Francisco, South Park.  Very nice restaurant. Larry and Sergey were there.  They gave us all those Google Brio trains, you know, say G.O.O.  G.L.E. and and Larry and Sergey answered questions.  It was great. I remember talking to them.  And one of the things they said, which I thought was very interesting, I just can't  remember the exact details, is that I think was Larry every day would go would look at  he would look at the tail end of search like the the dregs at the end.  What was left? And it was always every day trying to improve that algorithm.  So, yeah, no search left behind and not doing it, as you say, by hand, but improving  the algorithms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the scales. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. And I just thought that I was I, to be honest, I was really impressed.  It was an engineering answer to the question that really made sense to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because we're all nerds. We're all loving that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we love that. We love the idea that there's a perfect algorithm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. Yes. And that's why we love Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There we go. Wait, let me write that down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like the idea that that could exist is just so appealing that it just makes me  love Google more. It's a trap.  It's a key PR trap.  And they fool me.  It's like I'm just going to keep working on my algorithm the rest of my life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It'll work out. It will.  It will. Just one rule to rule us all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a better algorithm, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So the Europeans are mad because Google.  OK, Wired reports the European Commission has acknowledged receipt of three  antitrust complaints against Google.  Google said not. We've done nothing wrong.  And disclosed that British price comparison site found them.  French legal search engine is justice that false and Microsoft owned  Chow from big were the complainants.  So the people complaining are other search engines.  They say Google abused its dominant position to promote its own services while  competing sites were penalized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're right back in the Microsoft land, aren't we?  You're using your dominant position with the operating system to promote your  browser. You're using your dominant position with search to show YouTube videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But this is what Google has consistently said.  And they said it again in their response.  Our algorithms aim to rank first what people are most likely to find useful.  And we have nothing against vertical search sites.  You mean indeed many vertical search engines like those three or money  supermarket dot com typically rank high in Google's results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's the problem. When you get to court and discovery is Google going to have to  hand over the algorithm.  Mm hmm.  Coke formula.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Can't they do just empirically and do some searches and say here's what we got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They've got to prove at some point that it is the algorithm that does it.  I mean, if it gets to court, you know, it's really a.  Well, I'm trying to use a podcast safe word.  Go ahead.  So saying for Microsoft to do B.S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  thing to do. Yeah, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is a good Microsoft uses MSN and MSNBC to wrote its stuff.  Yes, everybody does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm what do you think I do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is their home page from their stuff.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But but I guess if you're saying we are an agnostic search engine that's going to  produce the best results, you should.  You should do that, whether that's Google or not.  They say they do.  They say they do.  China has widened its censorship.  It's not going the right direction.  And I guess at some point, Google's going to have to make good on its problems.  Good on its promise and pull out the Chinese government is according to  Wired's threat level blog.  David Kravitz writing the Chinese government is imposing new internet  restrictions, demanding personal website operators to acquire government  permission to operate their sites.  This is for all dot CN domestic domains.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that ran killing Google Mail and requiring everyone to use the government.  See horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Horrible.  Of course, you know, Geeks, the first thing to do is get a proxy server running.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Well, that's obvious.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Obviously.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's why God created tour.  The government said the latest move, which also requires site owners to submit  a photograph and show identification.  You probably should have to hold up a newspaper with today's date on it was  targeted at tackling pornography.  That's what they always say in China.  Oh no, it's about pornography.  Critics say, of course, it's based on silencing, silencing dissent.  So since China does not seem to be moving forward in, uh, in opening, uh, itself,  when does Google, when does, when does Google, uh, when is the deadline?  When does Google pull the plug?  They didn't say it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was Steve, but nothing keeps on giving me crap and Twitter saying they haven't  done it yet.  But I said, well, they didn't say that when they were going to do it.  Uh, there's obviously, uh, you know, diplomacy takes time and Google's a  nation now.  Do they have to wear like those big sashes across the chest and, and, and

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  morning coats?  I'll bet Larry and Sergey would like that.  I would love it.  Or a sunlight too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There was, I don't know if this really happened or not, but, uh, Bill Gates or  not Bill Gates, Steve Jobs has supposedly went around to the wall street journal  and other New York newspapers, uh, to coerce them into creating content.  The times to creating content for the iPad, but the, the, the, the, the  scandal journal report of it said that he was wearing a strange top hat when  he was doing it.  They didn't mention a sash, however, I don't know what, I don't even know what  that could be.  I would like to see a picture of that.  Nexus one may be coming to Verizon March 23rd.  Um, isn't that the first day of spring?  First day.  That's what they said.  Spring.  This is according to a Neo in.net, which is a rumor site that would be, it would  be also the, the, uh, first day of the CTIA Congress, which is a big cell,  cell phone Congress conference.  So do we regret getting, um, the T-Mobile version?  No, I liked GSM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I agree, but I've got to tell you that T-Mobile is worse than, yeah.  It's just a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a,  it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a,  Florida was my parents and it's not, I'm getting some dropouts versus AT&T.  Gina, how's your experience with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My, my experience has been pretty good.  I tell myself it's because like San Diego is a second tier city, so things are not  too bad, so it's one of the advantages, but it's been, it's been okay even on the road.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um, you know, when the test will be, when we're in Austin for South by Southwest and  all those geeks with their iPhones are going, exactly.  And we're going, well, I've seemed to have three boys here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  Can I make a call for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Would you like me to do an internet search for you?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wouldn't that be nice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I've talked to my brother for about an hour today on my phone and he was on his iPhone  and the call dropped three times on his side and he was just like, Oh, sorry, I got an  iPhone.  Like he didn't even,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  anyway, of course you have an iPhone.  Well, we, of course we didn't expect that call to survive.  Lifehacker has a list of the top 10 Android apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  I wanted to, I bookmarked that especially for Jeff.  Kevin wrote this at Lifehacker.  Kevin is a twig listener and he is also my like Android guru.  Really?  We need to have Kevin on sometime.  Let's have him on next week.  Yeah.  He's got the goods.  I'm going to ask him.  I'm glad you said that publicly because now he can't say no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Come on, Kevin.  We're going to, here we'll give you a nice plug for your article on Lifehacker.  He recommends number 10 layer.  That's the augmented reality browser.  You know, this is cool.  Totally useless, but it's kind of cool.  I mean, it's totally useless.  Do you use it for anything?  I use it to show off the Nexus one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, it is kind of one of those novelty things.  Um, but worth it.  I mean, it's definitely a, Ooh, this is cool kind of app.  I can't say that I use it a lot, but I think, I think it was worth being on a list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Listen, which I do use and then it was just upgraded, which really made it  frankly a lot better, got rid of some of the things that's sinking into Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  reader.  Yep.  Um, key Anycut, which is a super, super charged shortcut manager.  You can add shortcuts to your desktop and that's just something that iPhone doesn't  do.  You just can't, there are just certain kind of shortcuts that you can't put on  your home screens on the iPhone.  Anycut is really great.  Uh, secrets, which is a, um, kind of password pin secure.  Ooh, it's keypass compatible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Cause I use keypass.  Yeah.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You use keypass, you can transfer your keypass database onto your phone and  secrets will open it.  Um, slide screen, which I tried out for a while and really, really like didn't wind  up using it, um, continuously because it didn't support my app, my Google apps  account, but if you're using just your Gmail account, slide screen is pretty,  pretty fantastic.  So what does it do?  Um, it replaces your home screen with a, with a kind of newsfeed-y like, um, uh,  um, view of your information, your, your most recent SMS messages, your most recent  email, your, um, you know, your Twitter, Twitter stream, and you can kind of slide  up and down, up and down the screen and expand different sections of the screen  to, to read more.  Um, and it's just beautiful.  And it looks really good.  Yeah.  Try it, try it out.  The free version has a little ad at the bottom.  There's a premium version.  Get rid of the ad.  Um, like I said, I had a little trouble with my Gmail versus my regular Google  account versus my Google apps account, but for someone going straight to it's,  it's, uh, it's fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I always buy the premium version.  Even if I don't think I'll use a program again or whatever, I just want to support  Android developers and it's a buck, it's two bucks.  I just want to give them money so that they know that there's a market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's just my little way of saying, come on, keep going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, keep going.  Keep going.  Uh, Google proper, which you talked about last week.  Great program.  PDA net, which we, yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's from you.  I got that.  Yep.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  PDA net we talked about for tethering for, you know, straight up tethering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I use a different, I use a different task killer.  So I'm gonna have to look at this new one, a task killer free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I haven't, I actually haven't used task killer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um, what do I use?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's, um, but I have gotten questions about how  do you GTD on your phone?  What's your, what's your tasks on your phone?  And, um,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  well, no, this is for killing a, not, not, not to do list.  This is for killing a running.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  For kill.  I use it.  I usually call it advanced task killer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what I use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Gotcha.  Gotcha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And so it, but it's, I think they're probably all the same.  This one has a little ad at the bottoms.  It's free also, but you just kill everything that's running.  Boom.  Boom.  Oh, nice.  It's very satisfying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And have you noticed, I'm noticing a little bit of lag sometimes on this and  sometimes I'll turn it on and, and, and, and it won't, you know,  it won't recognize my finger presses right away, which is very frustrating.  You can't get in.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have the same problem.  I don't even have, uh, I shouldn't say this, but I don't have a code on it.  I just gave mine away.  Just turn it on.  Has the same problem for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You just gave yours away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Anybody want to see that again?  Let me just do that again.  Jeez Louise.  It's that, you know, just so you know, what my password is.  I think, you know, it's so funny because I don't know our Google people more.  Um, cause the iPhone, it's a number, but on the Google  people, you draw a pattern and it, I'm not, I'm, I could remember the number easily.  I could, the patterns I had it like, I forgot it.  I had to try and try it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Couldn't remember the pattern.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Say, and also, I mean, the screen, it's like, if the screen is clean and you do  your pattern, like you can see, that's a good point.  I didn't even think of that.  I mean, you gave it away.  Well, you had to do it right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're right.  Oh, look, there's the, there's the smear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  The smear, the finger grease smear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you should change your pattern every day.  And then not clean the screen.  Speaking of smears.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I went to Best Buy who I love and full disclosure is that I've, I've, I've,  they've brought me out there and I got the screen protector that they have in the  store and it's kind of jelly-ish and I don't like it.  I don't want a gooey screen.  I love the one that I have for my iPhone, which is the crystal one they sell in the  store, which the store was nice enough to put on for me.  Um, any recommendations for anybody about, uh, do you guys use a screen protector  for this thing?  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's my phone is naked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Me too.  I even got rid of the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I went through a phase where I covered everything and a jealous skin and the whole  thing, and then finally I was like, you know what, like the whole point is that  you use it and so beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's exactly right.  You, the phone, look at in a year, this is going to be crapped up no  matter what you do, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  But now I feel like I'm just not being helpful at all to Jeff.  Um, but, but so that's all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The one that you got obviously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've got one of those, you know, keyboard protector things, like those little  rubber things are for my keyboard really for crumbs because, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  because you eat while you're typing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  But, but it always gives me, gets me looks when people see me on my

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  do you have a, like plastic on your sofa?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the keyboard condom.  No, no, it's not plastic on this, but I definitely has a keyboard condom.  Um, but, but, but no protector on my, on my phone.  So I guess it's, you know, we're all anal about something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I used to have the silicone case and everything because it is a little slippery  and thin, but it's just so beautiful and elegant the way it is.  I just like, I like to have it just plain and you know what?  I'm going to have another phone in a month anyway.  So what does it matter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know me.  But for people like Jeff and I, you commit to the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're committed.  Oh, no, no, no.  I'm a little butterfly that flits from phone to phone.  I don't ask me to commit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Fickle Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Fickle.  Uh, number two is waves secure, which I don't know.  It's free to March 31st though.  So get it.  What does this do?  This backs up all your data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Backs up your data and locks it down.  I didn't know about this one either.  Uh, but you can do remote wipe.  It backs up your, uh, your phone's data to,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have another program that I use.  It's similar to that, that also does an antivirus scan.  I don't know how useful, but it has an antivirus scan of everything.  Um, when I download it, it's called lookout and it's also free.  And it has a, it has a backup.  Um, you know, it has the antivirus data backup and it also  has a missing device.  It doesn't have to wipe now, but it has the, but maybe it does.  Let's see what the miss locate your device or make it scream from my lookout.  So my lookout.com.  Yeah.  So that if you like lost it in a sofa cushion, yeah, yeah.  You can make it go, ah, I'm over here.  So I use this.  I don't know.  I don't, you know, it has a virus scan and it scans new downloads.  And I don't know.  I have no idea if there's anything, any merit to that at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I, you know, I wonder how long is it going to take until  malware makes it into the market?  That's inevitable.  Right.  That's what we know that Android viable market, you know, that's like, it's  like a really, it has gotten market penetration when there's a, when there's  a virus or malware in the market.  I hope that doesn't happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  These things are such obvious targets because the, you know, all you have to do  is make a phone call to a special number for that costs you 40 bucks in the, in  the bag, I guess 30 bucks and it was worthwhile, let alone all the data you  got on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Number one, I also use this called Astro file manager.  And this is actually look at your files.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Just, just important to every geek.  One must be able to get access to the file system, even though a lot of  UI designers would say, ah, the file system should be abstracted away from  the user, you shouldn't have to look at it.  I don't know.  I like being able to browse my folders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  Yes.  Right to browse my folder.  It just seems like if it's got a file system, I should have access to it.  Yeah.  Bugs the heck out of me and my iPhone.  For some reason, I cannot get my photos off the iPhone.  Nothing will take them off.  And I just want to say, well, let me browse the file system and then get them  and figure out what's wrong with them.  But I can't.  So this is nice.  It's nice that they have it.  It exists.  So we'll get, we'll get Kevin on Kevin Purdy, lifehacker.com.  That was his article.  Did you get a number yet?  A tip, a tool.  Do you want to just take the day off?  Can we, can we talk about Gmail?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've got a number if you don't go to the news, you just took one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  323 was the first one I had, which was a cheat.  I know.  Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  What about the Gmail stuff?  Yeah, that's that's good.  What's the deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Gmail graduated a bunch of labs features and retired a few.  So I love the whole labs thing that they did so that, you know, they have these  experimental features, any Google employee can, can, can plug them in and  anybody, you can enable them or disable them.  And it comes with this disclaimer that they might, might just break.  And what I love about it is that Google is using usage numbers based on who's  enabled, you know, how many, you know, how many people have enabled each one to  decide which one of these features should get built into the email by default.  And which should we get rid of entirely?  So they use that feedback.  So I think, you know, when labs launched, I actually flew to Mountain Views one  time that I went to Google and they launched, I think with 13, the number  features grew to 60.  And so this past week, they graduated six, search auto complete, which you'll  see when you just start to search for your Gmail search box, you'll see an  auto complete drop down, go to label, which is a keyboard shortcut thing.  The forgotten attachment detector, which is brilliant.  If you type like, Hey, I've attached this file and hit send without actually  attaching the file, Gmail will pop up and say, Hey, did you mean to attach  something before you send YouTube previews, which is just, you know, embeds  a video in your, in your mail, custom label colors and vacation dates.  So those are now built into Gmail based on user on you in labs.  They're now built in Gmail and then they retired a bunch, uh, muzzle fixed  with font email, added location and signature random signature, presumably  cause folks just weren't using them.  So, so I'm excited about that.  So you'll see some new stuff in your default, default Gmail.  And I mean, the only way that I think that they can make lab better is if  regular people could contribute features.  Um, yeah, that would be nice, wouldn't it?  It would be nice.  So like, kind of like wave, like wave, like sent you wrote the better

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Gmail, a Firefox extension.  I mean, that's one way to do it is to kind of do it from the outside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do it from the outside.  But the thing that's crappy about that is that the day, you know, the  minute they changed HTML, it's all a JavaScript, the minute they changed  HTML or any of the user interface, it's not the, it's not an official API.  You know, it's like, then stuff breaks.  Um, so, so yeah, that's one way to do it, but certainly more efficient to do it.  You know, from the, from the inside out.  So that's what I really like about labs.  And also it's great because a lot of the labs feature, in fact, when I went to,  to, uh, the Gmail, when I went to the Google campus and they announced labs,  they actually had a printout of all the user scripts that I had included in the  better Gmail Firefox extension taped to a whiteboard and said, like, you started,  you started with your extension and tried to make a labs feature.  Which was a huge, like such a compliment for me.  And, and you know, someone said to me, well, will you, were you upset that  they were basically, you know, making your, you know, part to your extension,  you know, not, um, not necessary.  And I was like, absolutely not.  I mean, anything that I can take out of it, great.  You know, if I can simplify it further, you know, fantastic.  So, so yeah, so that's, that's, uh, I really think that the labs, the, uh,  the labs model, I really liked that they change, you know, that they're evolving  Gmail based on usage, um, with these experimental features.  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So if you go to Gmail, uh, and just click the little green lab, uh, flask in the  upper right-hand corner, uh, then that's where, that's how you get to the labs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My favorite labs feature did not graduate though.  It's canned responses.  Yeah.  Which probably, probably only people with like insane amounts of email, like I  get, would use, but love canned responses.  And a few others.  There's one I want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I, as somebody said that it existed, but I can't find it anywhere.  I want to be able to mark something just not just in a  filter to delete it from now on.  I want to send the signal back to these PR people.  And if the email has an unsubscribe option in it, do it automatically.  I wanted to do that.  If I, if I saw a request.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  At some point you just make them spam and that's not in there.  And that's what they don't want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They don't write.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  The problem is that they don't know that you've done that.  Like I want to be able to mark somebody's email spam and have to Google send them  a message and say, this user reported you as spam.  What are you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Just to get to them.  Cause it's satisfying to do that, but they don't know.  Um, so you want a canned response.  Um, Jeff, that's basically says please unsubscribe me from your list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no, that the clicks on the, that actually does the action clicks on the,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  oh, that clicks on that unsubscribe button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's that, by the way, hit to PR people who send me irrelevant stuff.  And when I sound like Michael Arrington for a moment here, but, but it's bad.  And I, you know, when I unsubscribe, I'm trying to shut you up.  Don't send me another email saying, okay, you're unsubscribed.  Just put salt on the wound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that's funny.  Somebody sent me a link in the chat room to an iPhone, uh, Explorer that allows  me to browse files on my iPhone.  Thank you.  iPhone dash Explorer.com.  And I just deleted all those pictures that I couldn't get rid of.  So thank you.  Chat room is very useful.  And I might as well mention to Jeff that there is a suggest a lab feature.  There's a link right at the bottom there where you can suggest that feature.  There's quite a few in here.  Actually 42,725 to be exact.  You might not be like on the top of the list, but it'll be in there.  Gina, I guess that could be your tip.  How about that?  That's your tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I actually do have a tip.  Okay.  Just launched this week.  Um, this is a, there's a new option in the side of your Google search results  location.  Uh, so I just searched for hamburgers cause I'm going to have dinner soon.  Cause I'm in the East coast.  And, uh, so if you click on, do a Google search, click on show options and, uh,  down on the left side under, you know, it says all results.  If you hit social, we've talked about this already.  That's results from your friends.  If you click on nearby, you'll get location based, uh, results.  There's a McDonald's in Asbury park, New Jersey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What a surprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Look at you even get image results.  Ooh, local image results.  Hey, this is great.  This, you know, it actually was one of the stories we were going to talk about is  they are slowly rolling out the new Google search UI.  And so there's a, there's a three column thing and you're going to, if you, if  you don't already see these, uh, extra features, you're going to start seeing  them soon.  This is really, uh, I think this is great.  Anyway, it only makes sense.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It only makes sense.  Much more useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And you could turn it on and off.  So it's not like you have to see it.  All right.  There's your nearby tip.  And now Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, well, all right.  The number is a bit of a cheat, but what the heck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's three to three though.  You said that.  What was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  March 23rd, uh, one of Verizon.  Got it.  It was a cheat.  I bet it was a cheater.  So I'll use a news story here and the number is a 100 plus, which is the number  of companies targeted by the Google hackers, according to a security vendor,  Isaac partners, uh, this from Robert Macmillan at computer world and, um,  that they've identified 34 hack companies after examining a single command and  control server used in the Google attack.  Then the discovery of another 68 servers could mean that many more companies  were compromised than previously thought.  So they think it's over a hundred companies.  Wow.  Which I wish that these companies would stand up and, uh, say so because they've  got to, you know, stand at Google, standing out there all alone and naked.  Yeah.  Fighting this.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My tip of the week comes from the Google page itself.  If you go to a Google.com and, uh, it's a timely one.  You want to know more about Chile and the magnitude 8.8 earthquake with those of us  who live in San Francisco and lived through a six, nine, uh, 20 years ago.  8.8 is unimaginable.  Google's got a crisis response page.  This is something they've done.  They've always done so well.  Uh, and they're doing it once again with donations to UNICEF, direct relief,  uh, resource updates, a link to the state department for friends, uh, Americans  with friends in Chile or family in Chile.  Um, a map mashup that includes a person finder, uh, where you can either say I'm  looking for someone or I have information about someone so useful and Google's  always Google does that because during Katrina there were a hundred people

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  finders, so you had to have a people finder to find the people finders.  And you've got to centralize this.  So it's a good thing.  Finders to find the people finders and you've got to centralize this.  Yep.  Centralize it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And it's built on Google app spot.  It's a, which, which is interesting as well.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, so they, so did they do this or did somebody, uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not sure who built this.  I, I imagine they did it if it's on their official kind of Chile page.  But several people Twittered this to me, this person finder, it's  chilepersonfinder.appspot.com.  Right.  Um, very cool.  I assume that this was an internal thing, but it need that they deployed  it on app spot so quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Boy, it's just really neat.  I mean, this is, this is where, you know, you can really step up and, uh,  and make a huge difference and they've really done that.  It's a creative commons, uh, licensed under Apache 2.0 license.  So, uh, yeah, yeah, it's a person finder at google groups.com for the mailing list.  That's neat.  I think that'll be used again and again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Facebook will be patented soon.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um, I'm sorry, I was sitting on the wrong screen.  There it is.  That's the screen I was going to show you.  Um, Jeff Jarvis is the man in charge of buzz machine.com.  It's always great to have you on Jeff.
