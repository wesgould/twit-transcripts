Start time: 273.16
End time: 299.59
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  I'd like to do that as well.  Join us coming up here soon at the beginning of August.  And hopefully my description doesn't confuse anybody.  I'm not just wanting to have coffee with people.  You don't have to have coffee to do it.  It is coffee time but it's based on coffee with your photography.  Nice.  The theme is coffee time.  Regardless of what camera you have, go take some pictures and let's do a critique, shall we?  Friday, August 4th.

Start time: 300.50

Start time: 307.50
End time: 313.10
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  What does coffee time mean to you?  Put that in a photograph. That's all.  I didn't think it'd be that difficult.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Stacey Higginbotham, host at stacey on iot.com,  at Giga Stacey on the Twitter,  and our IoT expert.  And actually the first story is right up your alley.  And I know you're ready to talk about this.  The Biden administration has announced  its new smart home cybersecurity label.  It's the US Cyber Trust Mark.

Start time: 381.11
End time: 383.97
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Really? You're going to use their story?  Yeah, you could show Stacey's.

Start time: 385.12
End time: 388.84
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  I have a story.  I put in the rundown.

Start time: 389.30
End time: 390.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I put Stacey's.

Start time: 391.00
End time: 396.01
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Their headline was,  Biden administration does a cybersecurity label  for smart TVs.

Start time: 397.63
End time: 408.38
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  How about this?  According to Stacey on IoT,  the White House details,  it's IoT Security Label Plan.  So what is it and how do it work?

Start time: 410.09
End time: 441.24
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  This, yeah, this is the US Cyber Trust Mark.  They introduced the concept of doing this back in October.  And the Biden administration is basically  creating a voluntary program,  kind of like the EPA's Energy Star thing.  And if you see this on a product,  and it won't be out until like 2024,  but if you see this mark on a product,  you can trust it.  This product has met cybersecurity standards.  And you might be like, what standards Stacey?  And the answer is,  we don't exactly know that.  But.

Start time: 443.94
End time: 452.67
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it's your article says they're leaning on a NIST document,  the National Institutes of Standards and Time.  Yes.  So what is it?

Start time: 454.46
End time: 508.96
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  The NIST 8524 document.  It's actually a really good document.  So this came out in 2022.  Y'all are like, Stacey, that's crazy.  It's too much.  It's 30 pages.  It's not.  Don't worry.  What NIST has done basically is they took a deep dive into IOT,  and they were like, well, crap,  IOT is really hard to secure for a couple of reasons.  One, you got hardware, software, cloud, all this stuff.  You got an ecosystem of devices talking to each other.  And then you've got devices that range from like really important things,  like medical devices, all the way down to like,  I used to have an egg counter, right?  They counted my eggs and all of those different levels of time.  Timed your eggs or counted them?  It was called the quirky egg counter.  Did it count how many eggs you have?  It literally only existed to let me know how many eggs were in my fridge.  It was a fun thing that I got.  Wait, what?

Start time: 509.16
End time: 511.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've heard of an egg timer, but an egg counter,

Start time: 512.50
End time: 514.90
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  it seems not as confusing as coffee time.

Start time: 515.75
End time: 520.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So useful and all that.  Anyway, good.  I hope it's secure.  God bless it.

Start time: 521.37
End time: 521.96
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Better be secure.

Start time: 523.01
End time: 526.94
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Don't want to let the Chinese know how many eggs you have.  The server went down.

Start time: 527.58
End time: 530.96
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  But the point is like that thing did not need like.  They went out of business.

Start time: 531.00
End time: 538.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  How do I count my eggs?  Not until they're hatched, young man.

Start time: 539.02
End time: 539.14
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Wow.

Start time: 540.51
End time: 540.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly.

Start time: 541.06
End time: 545.90
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is that a dozen?  Is it five?  I don't know.  Unbelievable.

Start time: 546.40
End time: 558.96
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  So that is an example of a device that you're like,  if someone can see how many eggs I have, I don't care.  But if someone can see like my blood glucose or maybe can hack my pacemaker,  that's very different.

Start time: 559.00
End time: 570.69
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Even more than that, it could be a gateway into your personal, into your network.  So even if it could be, you know, it's not merely that they could hack your egg counter,  it's that they could then get into your network and do other bad things.  That is true.

Start time: 571.41
End time: 678.91
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Right.  And that is why they're doing this.  That is that is one of the big reasons why the Biden administration has come out with this  labeling plan and everybody's on board.  And by everybody, I do mean everybody.  Like the CTA is on board, the CSA, which is doing the matter standard is on board.  Amazon, Google, Samsung, Best Buy, Logitech, like lots of companies are on board.  But the standards so far are really good.  There are things like no default passwords, you're going to need multifactor authentication,  encryption at rest on the device, encryption when it's going anyplace else.  And then encryption where it's stored in the cloud.  Nice.  There's a ton of there's actually a really interesting thing that we don't see on a lot of IOT devices,  which is data logging.  They want to.  Well, NIST calls the mirror prices.  NIST calls for things like data logging and monitoring.  So manufacturers and consumers should be able to see what's happening, who are their devices are  communicating with, how often they're communicating, logging changes to the systems.  So you can read the document.  You can read my blog post where I sum up like fairly quickly what the six items that NIST is kind of  looking for are.  But here's the here's here's the devil in the details that always happens with any legislative effort.  What the White House announced is like, we've got this label and they showed off the label.  Yay.  What they still need to do is build the program and actually set the security criteria.  So they're going to do that with the FCC and the FCC has they're going to start what they call it's called  a notice of proposed rulemaking.  But it's basically how the FCC sets rules.  And you'll get a chance to comment on all these rules.  Everybody else will.  And then the FCC is going to be like, here are the official criteria from on high.  Is this somewhere else?

Start time: 680.44
End time: 686.00
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  We see lobbyists coming in to play and saying, hey, well, we really like this because this stuff comes out

Start time: 686.00
End time: 704.09
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  because this stuff costs money.  You can't you know, the only reason they wouldn't build it is because it costs money to do it and to maintain it.  Can I ask one question?  Does it does the NIST document talk about update auto updating?  Because that's I think we agree the most important feature of all.

Start time: 706.00
End time: 712.37
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  It does talk about auto updates.  There's I think it's like the fourth section maybe you were scrolling through.  Good.

Start time: 713.00
End time: 719.79
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it suggests that these devices should be updated firmware, updatable in case of they have to be firmware, updatable.  Very important.

Start time: 721.10
End time: 748.98
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Good.  And they yeah, I will say the NIST rules are very comprehensive.  The one thing this label doesn't have that I'm really bummed about, but maybe it'll get it in the comments.  I don't know, is privacy.  So there's nothing in here talking about like how someone's data like what device what sensors are on a device, how your data from that device is actually used.  It's just all about.  So this is all security only, which is good.  But privacy is still a big part for most consumers.

Start time: 749.16
End time: 752.34
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They do talk a little bit about it should you know, the data should be.

Start time: 753.75
End time: 780.06
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  They don't talk about privacy at all.  So 2.2.2.  It's in documentation, but that is not actually one of the things you're going to need.  Like to get it's not one of their I don't remember the words they used to describe it, but the product capabilities.  So there are six product capabilities that need to be there.  And if you go into developer activities, 2.2.2 is documentation and that talks about like things you should have in there.  But.

Start time: 783.47
End time: 800.86
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, and also the Biden administration did not commit to fully supporting this document.  They said leaning, leaning on this NIST document.  Which is by the way, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, not Time.  I said time and they are responsible for time, but it's technologies.

Start time: 801.99
End time: 805.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  More than just time.  OK, this looks pretty good, though.

Start time: 805.59
End time: 811.04
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I mean, I mean, it's impressive.  What's the next step?  Do they have to go to Congress or can this be done by Fiat?

Start time: 812.90
End time: 852.00
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  The FCC is going to sometime soon ish within the next month or so.  I hope we'll issue what they call a notice of proposed rulemaking.  And then they'll be like it's usually like a 60 day comment period.  It can be anywhere from like 30 to 90 day comment period.  And that's when they're going to be like, hey, here's the NIST document.  Here are the rules we're thinking of.  What do you think?  And then people write that right in, tell them what they think.  And then the FCC will vote at a meeting to approve the program.  Good.  Now, open questions.  I mentioned privacy.  Second open question.  Hey, what happens if you don't like if you say you're secure and then you're not?  Yeah, what's the fine?

Start time: 852.10
End time: 853.57
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  That's more FTC than FCC in that case.

Start time: 855.00
End time: 858.56
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, no, because the FCC is responsible for this program.

Start time: 859.00
End time: 869.74
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  If you talk to people in Washington, the reason why is the FCC is like, we'll do it.  And the FTC is like, God, give it to them.  We are so busy.  FCC has more enforcement arms than the FTC.

Start time: 870.00
End time: 873.21
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  FTC has very limited enforcement capability.  FTC is busy losing cases these days, too.

Start time: 875.00
End time: 877.47
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Don't say that.  Cory Doctorow would spank you.

Start time: 879.16
End time: 882.38
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm going to get to that in a little bit.  So that's this.

Start time: 884.04
End time: 914.96
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  There's also a so the trust mark will be on the box, presumably sometime around 2024 is the hope.  And then there's also going to be a QR component, which is where you can look to see more fine tuned details, fine grade details about things.  And because security doesn't stay still, it's also where you'll be able to check and make sure it's still secure.  So if you're buying this box, you know, you're you're buying it off of a from a best buy.  In the middle of nowhere.  And it's been on the shelf for two years.  You can be like, hey, are you still legit with this announcement?

Start time: 915.72
End time: 917.05
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Have you seen any opposition?

Start time: 918.57
End time: 919.92
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No one's going to explicitly know it.

Start time: 920.10
End time: 921.68
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yeah, no one's not yet.

Start time: 922.08
End time: 928.74
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Anyway, they'd all be under the table and say, hey, as Senator Manchin, you know, this is a terrible idea.  Would you mind helping us?

Start time: 929.04
End time: 930.74
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  Yeah, that's like a lot of stuff.

Start time: 931.12
End time: 946.38
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  It just seems like so they'll come in to weaken some of the things.  You'll see their comments.  Yeah, you'll see them in the comments saying things like, all right, no default passwords is fine, but requiring multifactor authentication for some of this stuff is just too much.  It's too much.  Do they?

Start time: 948.33
End time: 948.98
Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Do they require MFA?

Start time: 949.36
End time: 950.05
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You would be surprised.

Start time: 951.36
End time: 955.00
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  So MFA is mentioned in there as one of the better ways to handle this.

Start time: 955.70
End time: 961.00
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But not required because that's a little that most consumers are not going to know how to do that.

Start time: 962.76
End time: 973.61
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Every device is actually so I talked to Ann Neuberger.  What's her title?  Ah, this is audio.  Ah, anyway, I talked to.

Start time: 975.72
End time: 986.01
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm not going to call Ann Neuberger, a national security official who serves as the deputy national security advisor for cyber immersing technologies for the Biden administration.  That Ann Neuberger?  Yes, that is Ann Neuberger.

Start time: 987.14
End time: 1026.66
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  That's Ann.  So she like it like with Energy Star, you know, every appliance has different criteria.  They have to meet different levels based on what they are, because like a washing to make an energy efficient washing machine is different than making an energy efficient refrigerator.  So there will be standards for different sets of devices, different IOT devices.  So you may not need MFA on your egg counter, but you might need it on your baby monitor.  OK, that's going to be part.  Yeah, so they're going to hide a lot of complexity behind this, which is good because most consumers, they don't want to understand all that and they shouldn't have to.

Start time: 1027.06
End time: 1039.73
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's an old joke about Silicon Valley companies, new startups releasing the T-shirt before they release the product.  And this is the Biden administration releasing the T-shirt.  This is indeed.

Start time: 1041.57
End time: 1043.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They got a label anyway.  Hey, we got a label.

Start time: 1045.93
End time: 1047.00
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There'll be a lot of space.

Start time: 1047.06
End time: 1049.57
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  You would always say discussion is good.  We need the discussion.

Start time: 1050.06
End time: 1055.45
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But I mean, really, seriously, they're announcing a label before they have a standard.  Good point.

Start time: 1056.00
End time: 1056.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I mean, come on.

Start time: 1057.00
End time: 1076.96
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Well, in October, I mean, so they announced this.  They actually announced that they wanted to create this label back in October.  OK, so we were all like, OK.  And then this got, you know, they were like, OK, here, let's here's what here's what we want this to do.  And this was supposed to be announced in April and it was not.  So, you know, these things take more time than we got a T-shirt.

Start time: 1077.28
End time: 1081.00
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm not complaining, but let's now let's finish the job.

Start time: 1081.12
End time: 1084.37
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  And we're going to get an NPRM.  It's going to be amazing.

Start time: 1085.47
End time: 1100.00
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Good.  So let the record also show I got CC on an email this morning from Craig Newmark.  All right.  Stacey responding to her newsletter saying what good news this is and how excited he is.  I think it's huge news about cybersecurity.

Start time: 1100.78
End time: 1107.90
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But remember, there's a presidential election in a year and who knows, you know, I knew Congress in two years.

Start time: 1108.56
End time: 1127.00
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  And well, OK, so and new members of the FCC have made their rules.  Yeah. Well, no, but you know, going to hurry up.  We'll have the criteria by the end of this year, presumably.  Good. And then so you would be able to see it before the election.  Twenty twenty four is when we're doing the election.

Start time: 1127.34
End time: 1142.56
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The other thing I really like is there's a kind of a nutrition label for IoT security, security and privacy facts that will be on the box.  So I think that's that's a really that's for I think for a consumer even more than the badge.

Start time: 1144.22
End time: 1145.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's going to be a value.

Start time: 1146.70
End time: 1150.80
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  So that's not necessarily what it's going to look like.  That's theoretical.

Start time: 1151.60
End time: 1153.96
Speaker: Leo Laporte

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's not actually. Well, this is from the FCC.  I mean, yeah, OK.  You know, I don't know.  I mean, obviously there will be opposition, although the good news is a lot of the IoT manufacturers that don't want this are Chinese no name brands that aren't probably going to have much lobbying clout in the halls of Washington, D.C.  And and in fact, the big companies like Amazon and Wise who are trying to compete against these no name companies will.  So let's hope that Amazon and Wise and Apple and all these other companies say here's an opportunity for us to distinguish our high quality products from these inexpensive Chinese knockoffs.

Start time: 1216.20
End time: 1232.60
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  I hope that is. Yeah, that is the hope.  Oh, that's a different level. OK.  So that might be the FCC's label because that's a that's a take from the side labs label, which has way too much information on it.  So can I ask a question, Stacey? Yeah.

Transcript:  It strikes me that when we talk about cybersecurity, there's two ends of this.  You've talked about the consumer end of this.  You want your baby monitor to be safe so somebody can't snoop in on it or whatever.  But then there's the larger national secure cybersecurity question about shutting down systems and wreaking havoc.  What is this really more about?

Start time: 1254.90
End time: 1336.80
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  So remember, Mariah, all the way back in 2015, December 2015.  Yeah, yeah.  Yeah. So that actually was taking over networked video cameras.  And they weren't actually true IOT devices.  They weren't modern. But what that did is that allowed hackers to take over and gather an enormous amount of bandwidth that was then used against U.S. companies or just companies.  So this is more so your there's two things.  The main thing is we don't want to give hackers access to bandwidth from consumer devices that they can then use to attack websites of whatever infrastructure, whatever.  Right. So to do those kind of DDoS attacks.  The other element is because and that's because consumers are dumb.  We don't we're not cybersecurity experts.  We shouldn't have to be right. So they want to lock that vector down.  And then the other part is they it's good for consumers.  I mean, if you can also benefit consumers by making it so I mean, we haven't seen anything like this yet, but it's not implausible to think of hackers getting a hold of popular like thermostats and doing a ransomware attack that, you know, locks everybody's thermostat locks everyone out in.

Start time: 1338.22
End time: 1373.86
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Right. But what I'm trying to what I'm trying to get to is this.  I wonder whether there's going to be much consumer interest or demand for labels on things beyond your standard moral panic.  The Chinese are watching, whereas the real import here is to not let their devices be taken over and bad things happen at a national level, at an infrastructural level.  So it's really the government that cares should care more about this than the consumer, whether the consumer cares or not may not matter so much as whether or not there's an agreement on the things that matter at the higher infrastructural level.

Start time: 1374.69
End time: 1402.94
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  There's there's two points there.  One is that we're bringing things into our home that are going to be ultimately connected back to our public infrastructure.  If you look at like demand response programs and this goal towards smarter energy management, and they mentioned in here they're going to work with the EPA for inverters and car chargers.  We're bringing things into our home that we're buying that are going to be connected back to the public grid in that case.  And the government does have a vested interest.  I agree with that. I think that's that's what I'm saying.

Start time: 1403.00
End time: 1404.72
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis

Start time: 1406.82
End time: 1422.94
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yeah, in stopping DDoS attacks and those things are very important.  But I do think there is also interest in making sure that a large swath of consumers doesn't suddenly see all of their door locks open at once.  Because we will.

Start time: 1423.04
End time: 1431.26
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Okay, okay. That's good. Right. All right.  You know, like a variety of things.  So yeah, I'm trying to understand the consumer demand for this.

Start time: 1432.32
End time: 1439.96
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You're going to hear people like us and other you know, the verge and everybody else say, make sure you get this.  You want this. You don't want to buy a device that doesn't have this.  I think that that's it just gives us a way to in a simple way.  I mean, we've been saying for ages, you've been saying for ages, Stacey, for instance, don't buy any IOT device.  It's not firmware updateable over OTA.  And we could say that door blew in the face, but most people don't even understand what we're saying.  That's what I was going to say.  You would have badger say it.

In fact, it's one of the reasons Apple with HomeKit has an advantage because people go, oh, Apple, they're going to do this more securely.  So I'm going to trust HomeKit devices over some no name Chinese smart plug.  Apple built that trust.  Yeah. And I think that this is, you know, look, it's our job to make this work.  It's their job to make sure that this happens.  And there are reasonable laws and the lobbyists don't take all this stuffing out of the Ottoman.  But I think it's our job also to tell consumers, make sure you look for the cyber trust mark.  Right.  Because that's important.

Like when I talk to people who are building connected devices, they're like, look, Stacy, I would love to like really go whole hog on this.  But I can't because I have to make my device as cheap as this no name thing from China because people don't know the difference.  With this, they've got something like everybody who cares about this will be working towards this standard.  And then everybody who doesn't.  Yeah, you could still buy a cheap no name sensor, but you know, you you won't know if it's a secure and there will be.  I mean, and people will still buy that. Don't get me wrong.

And so it's just a public health measure.  And if more people buy this than don't, then that's a good thing and it'll make a big difference, I think.  And I think that there's some incentive for the for business not to undermine this, but to make it a real standard.

He's great work in just a little bit.  First word from ACI Learning, our great sponsors, our listeners know.  I know you know the name IT Pro.  They've been one of our trusted, beloved sponsors for the last 20 years.  They've been one of our trusted, beloved sponsors for more than a decade since they started in Gainesville, Florida.  Now they're part of ACI Learning.  That's why you see ACI Learning all over our studios.  They are our studio name sponsor and a great company.  Together, ACI Learning and IT Pro have elevated their highly entertaining,  highly informative, bingeable video content with over 7200 hours of on demand IT training to choose from,  not just IT, but audit and cybersecurity too.  And it's all fresh and up to date because they've got those studios running out of Gainesville, Florida,  Monday through Friday, nine to five, create more great, bingeable, high quality IT training.  ACI Learning provides world class service from assisting you in choosing which learning path suits you best  all the way through helping you find the right career opportunity.  If you're beginning a new career in IT, this is the place to go.  You could fortify existing expertise if you're already in IT with self paced IT training videos,  interactive practice labs, practice tests so you can take the test before you take the final exam.  And it really works.  Felipe B was in public relations.  He just on the website shared his testimonial about and how much he loves ACI Learning's great edutainers, their instructors.  He talked about Wes who's been with IT Pro forever.  Wes is an awesome instructor, says Felipe.  I passed my 220-1101 on July 4th.  On the first try, he says, I'm coming from zero.  I was a PR guy, but I love it.  He manages to explain Wes he's talking about.  It manages to explain concepts in a way you understand it very well.  He says, Felipe says, I can't wait to start 220-1102 now.  That's a great story, isn't it?  No, you got to try ACI Learning's amazing instructors.  And then when you got the skills, practice them in the practice labs.  You can test, experiment, set up Windows Server, Windows clients, all in an HTML5 browser,  which means you can do it on anything, even a Chromebook.  And MSPs love it because they can actually test new apps and updates without compromising their live systems.  The practice exams, fantastic.  ACI Learning gives you practice exam questions from all the big certs, Microsoft, CompTIA, EC Council, PMI, many, many more.  I've always thought this, if you can take a practice exam over and over until you really got it down,  when you sit for the real exam, you're going to be so ready.  You're going to ace it just like Felipe did.  Access every vendor, every skill you need to advance your IT career in one place.  ACI Learning is the only official video training for CompTIA.  They've got Microsoft IT training.  They've got Cisco training, Linux training, Apple training, Security Cloud, and I can go on and on.

I'm not a shareholder in these like Linus is.  They're not an advertiser.  I just really think it's the answer to the right for repair and for reusability and sustainability.  These are upgradable laptops.  You can buy them assembled or assemble them yourself, but more importantly,  if a new processor comes out, you can get a new motherboard and put it in yourself.  They have keyboard modules.  Look, you can have a number pad or if you don't want a number pad,  you can take out the number pad and slide the keyboard over and make it central.  You can change where the trackpad... This thing is completely customizable.

I did that last time. I have the 13 inch.  In fact, at first I ordered an upgrade for the 13 inch.  You can upgrade it with an AMD processor and so forth.  Then I thought, well, or I could spend just a few thousand dollars more and get the 16 inch.  So guess what? That means that the next Leo's garage sale will have the 13 inch.  Woohoo!

Good friend, love Cory is a bit of a muckraker.  Some might think of him as a leftist, a progressive.

Transcript:  No, let me read to you. My God, writes Cory Doctorow, they sure hate Lena Kahn.  This once in a generation groundbreaking, brilliant legal scholar and fighter for the public interest.  This sounds like it could be the opening of Hamilton. Yes.  The slayer of Reaganomics has attracted more vitriol, mockery and dismissal than any of her predecessors in living memory.  She sure must be doing something right, huh?  A quick refresher in 2017, Kahn, then a law student published Amazon's antitrust paradox in the Yale Law Journal.  It was a brilliant blistering analysis showing how the Reagan era theory of antitrust, which celebrates monopolies as efficient, had failed in its own terms,  using Amazon as an exhibit A of the ways in which post-Reagan antitrust had left Americans vulnerable to corporate use or abuse.  The paper sent seismic shocks through both legal and economic circles and goosed the neo-Brandeisian movement, sneeringly dismissed as hipster antitrust.  This movement is a, I can skip the history lesson.  You just want the zings. Yeah, I like the zings.  History is good though, you should read the whole thing.  When Biden won the election. History is good.  Well, there's history calling right now.  Is that your landline calling?

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  When Biden won the election, he surprised everyone by appointing Kahn to the FTC.  She's the chairperson. It wasn't just that she had such a radical vision, it was also that she lacked the usual corporate law experience  that such an appointee would normally require experience that would ensure that the FTC was held by people whose default view of the world is it should be structured and regulated by powerful wealthy people in corporate boardrooms.  Even more surprising was that Kahn was made chair of the FTC.  And of course she got in because it just happened to be a moment in time where there were some Republicans who wanted to screw big tech, not because it was too big and powerful, but because tech leaders failed to wield that power in the ways these Republicans preferred.  So they got, they gave him some votes and he got her in.  But while tech leaders are 100% committed to the project of permanent oligarchic takeover of every sphere of American life, they're less full-throated in their support for hateful, cruel discrimination against disfavored minorities.  Biden's seating of antitrust policy to the left wing of the party combined with disaffected GOP senators viewing Kahn as their enemy's enemy led to Kahn's historic appointment as FTC chair, joined by Jonathan Cantor at DOJ in the antitrust division, Tim Wu in the White House,  Avaro Bedoya at FTC, Rebecca Slaughter, Rohit Chopra, really some big antitrust brains.  Crucially, these new employees weren't just principled, they were good at their jobs.  In 2021, Tim Wu, who brilliant professor wrote an executive, you don't like him so much, okay, wrote an executive order for Biden that laid out 72 concrete ways in which the administration could act with no further congressional authorization to blunt corporate power and insulate Americans from oligarchs' abusive and extractive practices.  Since then, the antitrust arm of the Biden administration have been effin' ninjas.  And getting expletives.  Getting stuff done in ways both large and small, working for the first time since Reagan to protect Americans from predatory businesses. You can gather from this that Corey is a fan.  Right, you think?  Yeah.  This in market contrast, this is interesting to the corporate Dems champions in the administration.  The corporate Dems champions, like Pete Buttigieg, heralded as competent technocrats, realists who are too principled to peddle hopium to the base writing checks they can't cash.  Hopium?  Hopium. Yeah, I like that.  That's nice. That's a coreism.  That's a coreism. I don't think that I've ever seen that word before.

Transcript:  Take the Wall Street Journal.  Since Khan took office, they've published 67 vicious editorials attacking her and their policies.  Khan is living rent-free in Rupert Murdoch's head.  One major subgenre of the attacks is that Khan shouldn't be bringing any action against Amazon  because her groundbreaking scholarship about the company means she has a conflict of interest.  Holy moly, says Cory Doctorow, is this a stupid thing to say.  The idea that the chair of an expert agency should recuse herself because she is an expert is what the physicists call not even wrong.  He is a very good writer.  In any event, he defends Khan.  He says the fact that people are saying she's losing means that she's actually winning.  Yes, she's lost some cases.  Stop there.

Start time: 2961.00

She didn't want them to buy a company that does a VR game.  Yes, she's lost in those two cases and I expect her to lose more.  That is not a reason not to file those cases.  I would submit A, the very fact that the FTC is finally doing something is enough to get corporate boardrooms to set up a pay attention.  Well, the only thing, so the FTC does a lot more than just cases.

Start time: 3011.40
End time: 3051.96
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  So they've actually revoked some of their merger guidelines for older merger guidelines that are no longer applicable.  They've also, so they're trying to modernize the industry.  They're also issuing rulemaking, new draft merger guidelines that are actually really good.  They're actually talking about what we talk about, Jeff, changing the fact that we only look at low prices for consumers as the only reason to prevent a merger.  So they actually this month issued their asking for comments on new merger guidelines.  So in addition to the cases that we're hearing a lot about, they're also doing a lot of stuff behind the scenes.  Yeah, they're very this is and they're doing a lot of smaller enforcement actions.

Start time: 3052.48
End time: 3087.90
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Here's more, Cory.  Before Khan, the FTC was a conflict of interest assembly line, moving through corporate lawyers and industry hangers on without resistance for decades.  Khan is the first FTC head with no conflicts.  This leaves her opponents in the sweaty, desperate position of inventing conflicts out of thin air.  For these corporate lick spittles, Khan's conflict is that she has a point of view.  Specifically, she thinks the FTC should do its job.  And yeah, you're going to lose a few. You're going to win a few. Maybe we're going to lose a few.

Start time: 3088.06
End time: 3111.00
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  OK, so here's here's here's the question, though.  If they had someone who was, pardon me, older and more experienced, would they have done a better job of picking the battles right and winning more and then making more actual progress rather than giving the right wing.  Cases are not Murdoch. The opportunity to say, Nia, Nia, we can do anything we want now because because because you keep losing.

Start time: 3112.39
End time: 3195.36
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  So cases are brought for a couple of reasons.  And yes, it does suck that she's taken on two big cases and lost at well at that moment.  Now, she's taking on a lot of other cases that they're either driving to settlement or actually winning on or being told, hey, you have a point, but you got to come back with this.  And what I think is worth celebrating is the fact that, A, there is a point of view and it is a very pro consumer and pro small business point of view.  And B, they're firing on not just the major cases, but all cylinders.  And a lot of times you see like activists kind of people say they're activists or Democratic people come in behind the scenes and try to like do a lot of fluffy stuff.  That's pretty low value and low risk.  And they can get like Jessica Rosenhorstl, bless her heart, is a good case of somebody who's going for low risk, low value kind of wins when it comes to policy enactment.  She's very liberal. She's she's making changes that are pretty small fry and not really consequential.  Lena's doing well and now actually going after big stuff.

Start time: 3196.16
End time: 3234.28
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's really important that she's there because we have this AI thing looming over our head.  She's announced the FTC is investigating, not suing, but investigating open AI for non-consensually harvesting a bunch of personal information that needs to be investigated.  That's an old trick. She's lost these two, but at least she's keeping everybody honest.  She's gone after Amazon Ring as a privacy dumpster fire.  This is Corey's words.  Khan has talked how her agency is protecting mom and pop grocers from giant price gouging, greed, flation, drunk national chains.

Transcript:  I'm sure that's kind of what the inspiration for Corey's and shitification article, which is similar.  Similar premise, I think.  Khan's opponents did manage to repeat a lot of smears against her, but not the bogus conflict for interest story.  This is where it's germane to Jeff's accusation.  They also accused her of being 0 and 4 in her actions to block mergers.  Now, here's the response, Jeff, ignoring the huge number of mergers that have been called off or not initiated because M&A professionals now understand they can no longer expect these mergers to be waved through.

Transcript:  I understand what you're saying is there might be a middle ground.  What you don't want is an FTC that says, come on everybody, just merge.  We don't care.  But you don't want somebody to pick fights they can't win.  And so the only argument would be is she picking fights that she can't win.  That's my point.

Start time: 3367.04
End time: 3400.98
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  That's my point.  Okay, that's fair.  And it's not just winning.  I mean, and also I think one can judge whether all the fights are the right fights.  I disagree with some of the fights.  You're going to agree with some.  We're going to disagree with some.  And that's okay.  But I think she came in on Alpaisio.  She came in as an ideologue.  And it's hard for an ideologue in Washington to make great victories.  And so at some point she's going to disappoint those.  At some point I'm surprised I don't see Corey at some point kind of saying, but I wish we'd win more cases.

I do say well, she the right wing is going after it all kinds of whole laundry list of things.  I'm not doing any of that.  I'm saying, A, she's lost important cases.

That's what normally happens.  If we back Con and her team, Corey writes, they will protect us from these scams.  Don't let them, him, convince you to give up hope.  This is the start of the fight, not the end.  We're trying to reverse 40 years of Reaganomics here.  It won't happen overnight.  There will be setbacks.  But keep your eyes on the prize.

But I think in the final analysis, if you look at the entire scope of what this very active FTC has done, it is absolutely positive.  And so I just want to caution people to be a little bit careful focusing on, well, she's lost four cases now.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by Brooklinen.  I must buy more so that I can have, because I change the sheets every week because I am a civilized human.  Brooklinen is the best linen ever from Brooklyn.  Brooklinen, B-R-O-O-K-L-I-N-E-N.  Sleeping during the hot summer months and we are getting the hot summer months to say the least.  Can be a little bit sweaty, a little bit difficult.  That's why you need Brooklinen's hotel quality luxury bedding delivered directly to you at your door for a fair price.  Because they have sheets for the cool sleeper.  Cool off with their crisp classic percale weave.  Now Lisa and I opted for the best selling buttery smooth Luke's Satin sheets.  Oh, those feel so good.  Brooklinen's mission is to provide you with hotel quality luxury bedding at a very fair price.  And I have to say having bought very expensive linens, I was so pleased to see the prices of Brooklinen.  Founded by husband and wife duo Rich and Vicky in 2014, about nine years ago.  Brooklinen has everything you need to live your most comfortable life.  Upgrade your home with quality products, curated designs that will leave your guests swooning.  Brooklinen has been making dream spaces a reality for almost a decade.  I could see Jeff saying, hey, you know those Brooklinen sheets sound pretty nice.  Mind if I come over and try them out?  I do mind. These are mine. These are mine.  By the way, they also have an organic collection now, which is really cool.  But the key with Brooklinen is they use the highest quality long staple cotton that makes such a difference.  And it's not just sheets, by the way.  They have, in fact, you'll save money if you bundle bed, bath or both together.  We got the sheets, we got the pillowcases, we got the duvet, we got the towels.  Oh, I love my Brooklinen towels.  Save up to 25% when you're bundling.  Wirecutter and Good Housekeeping both said Brooklinen is outstanding.  And it's not just those two.  They have over 100,000 five star customer reviews.  100,000. It truly, Brooklinen truly is the Internet's favorite sheets.  One reviewer said, I seem to get that wonderful sleeping temperature very quickly and stay there throughout the night versus with my older cotton sheet sets.  Another said, I look forward to going to bed every night, slipping in between those beautiful, buttery smooth look, sateen sheets.  Ah, it feels so good.  That reviewer's name, Leo Laporte.  So, who's that guy?  Best sheets in the world like butter, like butter, my friends.  That wasn't me.  Brooklinen uses only the highest quality materials for all of their products.  Everything will last and last and last.  It's made that way.  Shop in store.  Yes, there are Brooklinen stores.  Check for one near you.  But I think most of us are going to do it online at Brooklinen.com.  Give yourself the cooling sleep you deserve this hot summer.  Use Twig as the offer code.  $20 off your online purchase of $100 or more.  Plus free shipping.  Brooklinen.com.  And don't forget that promo code Twig.  Very important.  So they know you saw it here and you get the $20 off and free shipping.  Brooklinen.  Thank you, Brooklinen.  I slept on them last night, but you know, Wednesday's sheet change day.  So we're going to have to use some subpar sheet.  You could wash them the same day.  Oh, I could do that, couldn't I?  I didn't even think of that.  That's a good idea.  That's what we do.  That's what I do.  You take them off, wash them, and you only need one set, huh?

They are the preferred partner for Llama 2.

Start time: 4691.44
End time: 4716.12
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well the real, I think the real issue is, and we were talking about this on Windows  Weekly, Richard Campbell's been beating this drum.  It's surprisingly expensive to generate these models and then to support them.  And they need somebody like Microsoft with very big cloud infrastructure and Azure and  lots of Nvidia processors to do it.  So partnering with Microsoft makes, I think, a lot of sense.

Start time: 4716.34
End time: 4729.64
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Here's my question on the free part.  Is this an Android-like strategy?  Most of mine are.  Is this an Android-like strategy?  We're going to undercut everybody else and that's how Llama will become a dominant model?

Start time: 4730.88
End time: 4742.04

We move it over, as we move it over, all the white dots go to the left, all the black dots  go to the right.  We have the segregated vector machine boundary.  It's very simple.

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  That's inference.  That's different than training.  Oh.  So pre-training, you can do a model that is pre-trained.  So you feed it a whole bunch of stuff.  You get it pretty good.  And then you're going to like tweak it some more so it's even better.

Start time: 5039.48
End time: 5048.52
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, so I've actually wondered this for a long time.  So if I type into chat GPT a question, it is working on a static model though, right?

Start time: 5050.00
End time: 5065.65
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Yeah.  So, but you could pre-train a model with like basic rules.  So let's say for chat GPT, you pre-train it to kind of get a sense of what comes next  in English or how the English language works.  Right.  So then it can actually generate things.  But there's a feedback loop.

Start time: 5066.96
End time: 5071.28
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  But it doesn't need to go out on the internet again, does it?  I mean, it's got what it needs, doesn't it?

Start time: 5071.93
End time: 5110.58
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Hold on.  Hold on.  So you start there and then you take that pre-trained model and then you're going to  fine tune it with even more stuff.  And I don't know what they're doing for chat GPT to make it even better.  This is a very theoretical thing.  So now you're going to do it so you can do like Shakespeare maybe.  So it's pre-trained on English, the English language, and then you're going to train it  specifically for Shakespeare.  So then when someone gives you the prompt.  So now that's a model that can do that.  And then you've got the prompt.  The prompt is what you can put in and eventually the inference is how it's going to generate  the response based on the prompt that you've asked.  Did that make sense?

Start time: 5111.00
End time: 5129.42
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  And in fact, I asked chat GPT, it says it works by leveraging its pre-trained language understanding  and generation capabilities to process and respond to natural language inputs.  So it actually has this long eight step explanation.  It starts with training, which is what I asked.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, we make you do that and it's understandable.  You're provoked.  You're provoked.  We put you in that position.  With this part in the show.  Here we go.  While chat GPT is pre-trained in a vast data set, it can also be fine tuned on more specific  particular applications.  So that tailors it like Shakespeare, but it is essential to know chat GPT does have a  knowledge cutoff.  In my case, says chat GPT was September 2021.  So he doesn't have access to information beyond that date, but you could, you could add.  In fact, you can feed in information.  This is a new and fair, I think kind of interesting.  Times had a article today on how they've run out of stuff.  They've run out of cud to chew and they're looking for new ways to get new data into  these new models.  And I'm a little nervous about what they've, what they've come up with.  They call it.  Well, here's the FT.  Oh, darn you FT.

Start time: 5242.00
End time: 5249.70
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Oh, that's just synthetic data.  Yeah, that's just synthetic data.  So they do synthetic data, not because they've run out of stuff, but because it's cheaper  and easier to get.

Start time: 5250.04
End time: 5256.02
Speaker: Leo Laporte

Start time: 5256.12
End time: 5269.63
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  No synthetic data.  They don't use it because they're running out of it because like synthetic data is fake.  So you can't use it to train something to be understanding of like how humans are, whatever.  You use synthetic data because it's cheaper to get.

Start time: 5270.72
End time: 5372.88
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Here's what Aidan Gomez, who's the CEO of a startup cohere that's using this a lot.  If you could get all the data you needed off the web, that would be fantastic.  In reality, the web is so noisy and messy that it's not really representative of the  data you want.  The web just doesn't do everything we need.  So and Sam Altman talked about this, the founder of open AI.  He said he's pretty confident that soon all data will be synthetic data.  So get this, listen to how they do this.  Gomez says synthetic data is already huge, even if it's not broadcast widely.  For example, to train a model on advanced mathematics, cohere, which is one of the startup  that's doing this, might use two AI models talking to each other.  One is the tutor, one is the student.  Gomez says they're having a conversation about trigonometry.  It's all synthetic.  It's all just imagined by the model.  And then the human looks at this conversation, goes in and corrects it if the model said  something wrong.  That's the status quo today.  Two studies from Microsoft research showed that synthetic data could be used to train  models that were smaller and simpler than the current chat GPT-4 or Palm 2.  One paper described a synthetic data set of short stories generated by GTP-4, which only  contain words that a typical four-year-old might understand.  This data set is known as tiny stories, was then used to train a simple LLM that was able  to produce fluent and grammatically correct stories.  My concern is it's like mad cow disease, right?

Start time: 5373.18
End time: 5425.60
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Well, OK, so synthetic data isn't just for, I get it.  I get what you're saying.  It's not just for training language, large language models.  They use synthetic data for all kinds of things.  And in other cases, it works really well.  So like they use it to train drones on how to spot faults in pipelines instead of sending  over drones to take photos of millions of lines of millions of miles of pipelines.  They just generate what the flaws look like.  They show that to it.  They use that to train it instead of.  So synthetic data is actually highly useful for a lot of situations.  It could even be useful for teaching some teaching a computer about how a four-year-old  speaks because we don't have a lot of examples of four-year-olds and their language abilities  on the computer.  But you do have it.  You'd have to type it out to figure it out.

Start time: 5426.04
End time: 5476.12
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Chat GTP-4 can generate small words, tiny stories, and then you learn from that.  They give us an example of hedge funds, which are looking for black swan events.  There aren't a lot of black swan events.  So what they do is they create a hundred fake black swan events and then test against  that.  He says for banks where fraud constitutes less than a hundredth of a percent of total  data, the software generates thousands of edge case scenarios on fraud and then trains  AI models with this, just like your drones searching for pipeline breaks.  So that's not so bad.  It's learning from generated data to simulate the problem you're looking for.  So it's if you wanted to create a radiology analysis AI, you may not have enough scans  to show it to train it from the real world.

The tsunami of text swept into a self perpetuating cataract of content that makes it functionally  impossible to reliably communicate in any digital setting because there's so much bogus  content made up.  It's great.  And then there's a paper I also put in there where where researchers trained a model on  content created by AI models and they call it the cursive of the recursion.  It leads to what they say is model collapse.  Yeah.  It would be almost like junkier and junkier and junkier.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Garbage and garbage.  Yeah, we did.

Start time: 6275.74
End time: 6298.28
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  And you go to you forget AI.  You go to a startup called City Bureau that is doing brilliant work  training citizens to cover these kinds of things.  Know the limitations of that and pay them for it.  Darrell Holliday, the co-founder, just announced  he's going to move on to something else, which is interesting.  City Bureau is a great example of that.  At AI, it is empowered citizens.  That's how you're going to cover that stuff.

Start time: 6298.42
End time: 6316.74
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, but what if I mean, remember we talked last week  about how a conversation was recorded, fed to whisper  AI to transcribe, as you might do with a city council meeting  and then fed the chat GPT to summarize.  And it did a really good job.  Now, I guess you'd still need it or want a human to check it.

Start time: 6317.68
End time: 6335.42
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Well, no. And here's the thing.  If it's if it's about the sewer plat on Elm Street, OK.  But like the school board meeting that I went to, the last one I went to  was about the right wing trying to eliminate a sociology textbook  because it was a mean to white people.  No AI is going to get the nuance of that, babe.

Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  An editor. But it's also about going up and asking the right questions.  And it's about it's about more.  I mean, I have to sound like an old fart defending the human journalist.  What I'm really saying is, is that is that we in journalism  thought our value was in this thing called content.  And so a machine comes along that can make unlimited amounts of content.  That's not where our value has ever been.  Our value has been in asking the right questions, in challenging power,  representing communities and understanding their needs, giving them service.  That's where the value of journalism is.  But we see it in places like Go Media.  Now you see it as let's make more content to get more pages with more ads.

Start time: 6385.36
End time: 6389.34

End time: 6408.14
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  There's still a balance, though, because like we miss Higginbotham  was pointing out earlier, I agree.  There is still a place for some of those low hanging fruit pieces of,  you know, how do I connect to a Wi-Fi securely, you know, stuff like that.  That people, some people still don't know.

Transcript:  One of my students in  in our executive program was talking about this from Sweden  was talking about evergreen content.  Once you've written that once, you don't need to write it a hundred times.  You just link to it.  But people don't want to link to each other  because they want their own page with their own content, with their own ads,  with their own traffic, their own SEO.  Yeah, that's that's the ruin of journalism.  Did you see that?

Start time: 6430.60
End time: 6447.82
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  It's also how journalists learn.  I mean, the fastest way to get when you like, I mean, I'm sure you tell you,  well, you don't teach one on one, but in journalism, one on one, the fastest way.  OK, is to get on a beat, is start doing profiles.

Start time: 6447.90

Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  It's evergreen content.  Oh, profiles, it's how tos.  It's those kind of things.  And you do that so you can get so you can learn and build the expertise.  And I would argue that the one thing you left off isn't it isn't knowing  what your audience needs or wants.  Or is it just that it's the expertise that you build up over years of covering  yes, a place or a topic.

Doesn't he own a store right next door and right.  And then doing it, an investigative piece on it.  That's right.  You don't get that unless you actually go out and start doing reporting  and go out in the field.  And maybe that's doing reporting on something that's ostensibly pretty dull.  I wish we had local reporters who were going to those things  and looking for those stories.  But if you're sensible and smart, you're probably not going  into journalism anymore, right?

Yeah, I mean, I want to do this work that you're talking about,  but there hasn't been any pay in it. Right.  You know, no, it's five bucks a meeting.  There's been a there was some stat that was listed like two or three days ago  that talked about how those folks on those staffs are not even really  making a living. Actually, I should point out in Petaluma,

Start time: 6584.68
End time: 6608.14
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  the five bucks a meeting is what the city council members get paid.  Literally five bucks a meeting.  So they do that, I guess, because, you know, they want to be famous  or they want to support the community.  You can't expect people to try to make a living doing that.  But, you know, I feel sorry for anybody getting started these days.  I don't with the price of housing and the low wages.  I don't know how anybody's the guys in this economy.

Yeah, I guess I did when I was a kid.  Did you see Devendra Hardwar, who's what did he do?  He was putting into a South Park episode, not a real one.  Half a day.  Now, I have to say, South Park is probably something an AI could do.  This is this is a  I was thrust into an episode entirely produced by the show runner  AI model from the simulation,  which is the next iteration of the VR studio fable.  You want to see a little bit of Devendra?  He said all it took was some audio of my voice  literally recorded during a call with the simulation CEO,  a picture and a two sentence prompt to produce an entire South Park episode.  And while it wasn't the best I've ever seen, I was shocked by how watchable  it was, he writes.  That's all it takes. Yeah.  You want to see a lot?  I think I can play this.  I don't know. Is this actually that's a really interesting question.  Does this violate Trey Parker's?  So here we are.  And this is fair use. We're good.  Oh, this is them actually doing it with the showrunner system.  So they're choosing the South Park characters.  The hero is Devendra.  They're going to have Randy and Sharon in it.  It starts in the living room.  And here's the prompt.  Devendra, a tech journalist, is going from door to door  to warn people of the.  Coming AI apocalypse.  Sharon is annoyed while Randy wants to learn more.  And now we take you to South Park.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, he wasn't far wrong.  No, he was. Was it?  I feel like we've been here before with AI.  And it's I think the most important thing we can do at this point  is to see what it's to use it for the things it's good at summarizing documents.  We're using surprisingly large amount of AI now in our show production.  For instance, this surprises me.  There's an AI we use that goes through each show and picks out clips for highlights.  And I mean, you're not going to use them all, but it's narrows it down,  does the edit and then shows it to the editor.  And I'm not sure how it knows that this is a highlight.  Maybe people are jumping up and down or something.  Voice inflection. It could be a lot of different variables.  It does a good job.  And Anthony's telling me it does a good job.  And then we pick a handful of them and that's what we use for our promotion.  That's a huge amount of time saving.  Yep. And if an AI can do that, that's great.  So I do think there are things it can do and it's important to know what it can do.  But it's also just as important to know some things it's not going to do well  and may never do well, like drive a car.  And you really have to know where to.  I mean, maybe that's a bad example, but you really have to know where to draw the line.

Whether it was the introduction of cars, the rise of personal computers and the Internet,  people have managed through other transformative moments  and have, despite a lot of turbulence, come out better off in the end.  He says deep fakes and he says, I've been thinking about the longer term risks.  And he says they should not come at the expense of the more immediate ones.  And these are the more immediate risks.  Deep fakes and misinformation generated by AI could undermine elections and democracy.  Yes, yeah, yeah.  Um, he says to some degree, he thinks AI could solve that.  Two things make me guardedly optimistic.  One is that people are capable of learning not to take everything at face value.  We've had to do that, right?  But and that's a good skill.  Just got to keep raising awareness.  Just say, hey, that's clearly BS.  He says people, you know, for years, people fell for scams  with somebody posing as a Nigerian prince, but we've learned.  We need to build the same muscles for deep fakes.  The other thing that makes me hopeful is that, and I think you may be wrong on this,  AI can help identify deep fakes as well as create them.

I was almost going to put it in the rundown,  but I thought I would get hooted down for such a thing. So,  but it says that writing is a process, not just a product.  And that a lot of teaching about it is to get to that.  So there are useful things to do. Faculty support and learning this.  They're not against using it, but we don't use it in the obvious ways.

Oh no,  it was the category was words with two L's. Right.  Name a crisscross lattice work that is used to prop up plants in the  garden. And I know I knew what that was,  but I could not come up with the word Trellis and, uh, yeah,  you came up with.  Now Trellis is the fill in word when you can't come up with.

Transcript:  Well we agree governments lean to build expertise and I think Chuck Trellis is  right.  Political leaders will need to be equipped to have informed thoughtful dialogue  with their constituents. Oh, isn't that a thought?  Yeah.  They'll also have to decide how much to collaborate with other countries on  these issues versus going out alone. It builds right on that.  In the private sector,  AI companies need to pursue their work safely and responsibility,  protect privacy, make sure the models reflect basic human values,  minimize bias, spread the benefits to as many people as possible,  prevent technology from being used by criminals or terrorists. Yeah,  that's fair. Finally,  I encourage everyone you all to follow developments in AI as much as  possible. It's the most transformative innovation.  Any of us will see in our lifetimes.  So that answers the question of whether it's a parlor trick. He says no.  And a healthy public debate will depend on everyone.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, but okay.  And a healthy public debate will depend on everyone being knowledgeable about  its technology, its benefits and its risks.  The benefits will be massive and the best reason to believe we can manage the  risks is that we have done it before.  He liked Clara and the sun, if that's any help.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So if you are in the club and you want to input tomorrow at 1pm,  Jason's, they call it, he's calling it the AI playground,  cause it's not the show yet.  It's just a conversation about what that show can and will be,  which I think is really important.  And you know what?  I think what Bill Gates says is probably as good a charter as anything for  people.  No beef with that.  To prepare for the future.  Are there any other AI stories in our this week in AI?  Not really.  Hollywood, you know, the real,  the fight in the writers guild and the actors is about a lot of things,  the mini rooms and stuff, but there is this AI component.  Writers are worried about it. Actors are worried about it.  Studios who have proven themselves to be rapacious  capitalists are clearly going to look to whatever they can do to make this stuff  cheaper. And that means-

And she went to Netflix and I believe the deal was damn near a hundred million  dollars for Bridgerton and Queen Charlotte.  And I mean, she's really good at what she does.  It's unfortunate that now she's like, Hey, wait a minute.  Hey, I can't come in here and do this.  She's worth a quarter of a billion.

End time: 7495.64
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it's great if she steps up and says,  I want to protect the low paid writers and actors.  Even though I've made, you know, she was, she started a writer, I'm sure. So,  yeah, she was an unemployed script writer in Hollywood who had to work as an  office administrator, a counselor at a job center.

Transcript:  Oh, well this is another AI story that scares the hell out of me.  This is from Forbes. That was, that was a waffle side. Okay. Okay.  Real quick. Turns out they're putting in cameras everywhere. Right.  The police, well, for instance, uh,  in Westchester County up by where you live near the fancy people,  the police have put in cameras on the roads and cameras in the police cars,  uh, 434 stationary cameras,  46 mobile cameras and police cars scanning,  license plates and building a database of travel,  of people moving around.  They use this recently to bust a drug traveler.  It worked. Uh,  searching through a database of 1.6 billion license placed records collected  over the last two years from locations across New York state.  The AI determined this guy's car was on a,  it was typical drug trafficker driving.  You know, he was going short stops in a bunch of places.  He made nine trips from Massachusetts to different parts of New York,  following routes to be known to you, be used by narcotic.  It's very specific. Yeah. And for conspicuously short stays.  So the Westchester PD pulled him over,  searched his car. He was in fact a drug trafficker.

Start time: 7651.20
End time: 7655.72
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  They found a question there was there, was there,  was there a probable cause to do so? Well, yeah, wait.

Start time: 7656.64
End time: 7660.14
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  They found 112 grams of crack, a semi-automatic pistol, $34,000 in cash.

Start time: 7661.26
End time: 7663.56
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  What were they found? Did they have cause to pull him over?

Start time: 7663.86
End time: 7711.87
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  A year later he pled guilty to drug trafficking, but his lawyer  has now said, having found out about this system, the license,  the automatic license plate recognition system,  his lawyers said, uh,  this is the specter of modern surveillance that the fourth amendment must guard  against.  This is a systematic development and deployment of a vast surveillance network  that invades society's reasonable expectation of privacy with no judicial  oversight.  This type of system operates at the caprice of every author with access  to it. So we didn't know about this case. He pled guilty, pled out. Uh,  but I think you're exactly right. Who,  who says this data should be gathered?  I mean,

Start time: 7712.28
End time: 7718.90
Speaker: Jeff Jarvis
Transcript:  Colombo can sit there and look and see the pattern of how people crimes  and Colombo can then use that.

Start time: 7719.34
End time: 7751.74
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  But this has been an issue for years. Um, and the issue there,  there's two big issues. One, there's how to police,  how are the police and law enforcement using this data? Right.  So are they using it? Is it stored forever? For example,  because it is unequivocal that this data can be used  to track people at a personal level and monitor where they go the same way your  geo location data can be used to monitor you from your phone. Right.  So if you're driving, if you're not,

Start time: 7751.76
End time: 7762.04
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  which is another issue that information is widely collected and sold on not only  the law enforcement, so they don't have to do a warrant,  but to foreign governments like China.

Start time: 7763.16
End time: 7779.78
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Well, so the other issue, and this is a little bit more so  a, do what kind of due process things are there around this data and data  collection for police officers? The second issue is you're seeing things like HOA,  like HOA, what does HOA stand for? Home, you know,

Start time: 7780.30
End time: 7783.50
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  the homeowners association. Yeah. Homeowners associate.

Start time: 7783.94
End time: 7792.28
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  They're actually doing this and they're using it.  These are just normal citizens who are deploying this.  And then the president of the HOA uses this data to track all kinds of things.

Start time: 7793.04
End time: 7846.48
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I didn't know that. Oh God.  I have a friend who was constantly getting notes on her door.  You're parking in and around me.  You should use cars been parked here for more than 24 hours. I mean,  that was just some busy body watching. But imagine if you automated that.  It was, yeah, it was Kravitz. So there's, there are a number of companies doing  this. The one that the Westchester PD uses is RECOR.  R E K O R.  RECOR has sold its ALPR tech to at least 23 police departments and local  governments across America. And they, they're,  they say the benefit of our system is you can use it.  You're already installed cameras.  So you don't have to install any special cameras. And I remember about two years  ago, the city of Petaluma installed cameras on all the poles all around  town, not speeding cameras.  I'm thinking they're probably recording the license plates. Now it's great.  They caught this crack dealer.

Start time: 7846.54
End time: 7862.21
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  That's what I was going to say. I'm, I'm fine that this,  this offender was caught because they were in the wrong.  But my problem is when they went to pull them over,  what was the reasoning? I mean, was he speeding?  No, that's the thing. We've seen your pattern.

Start time: 7864.12
End time: 7870.58
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's exactly what Jeff was saying. Is there a probable cause? Well,  that's an interesting question for the courts. The other issue is,

Start time: 7870.86
End time: 7875.48
Speaker: Ant Pruitt
Transcript:  what if it was someone that borrowed my car doing all of that stuff and I happen  to be driving?

Start time: 7875.52
End time: 7907.28
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, also something that's illegal in some States may not be illegal in this  state. For instance, the Sacramento County Sheriff's office in Sacramento,  California, where abortion is not illegal,  was sharing license plate reader data with States that have banned abortion,  presumably trying to track people visiting abortion clinics in California from  States where it's illegal.  And there are legislators all over the country now that are trying to use this  information to prosecute people in their state who have gone to other States for  abortions. So this is a big issue.

Start time: 7907.58
End time: 7933.18
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  And Customs and Border Patrol also use it to track  immigrants. So like,  I stuck a link in there about my state and talking about what it can and can't  do with this and the concerns. But no, this has been a real,  like Electronic Frontier Foundation has been really active on this front for  probably before the pandemic. But I'm glad, yeah,  this isn't really an AI story as much as it is.

Start time: 7933.20
End time: 7967.26
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, it is because they've got this data and now they're using AI to  look at this data and look for patterns.  And that's where it really becomes even more problematic.  It's one thing if Colombo is looking at it,  the high shade-ish car has been going through the, that's one thing.  It's another thing if a machine with untold biases is looking at this  data and saying, you know,  well there's not a lot of bias around license plate readers.  And I know that people of color tend to drive that car.  So I think that adds three points to the likelihood that they're selling crack  and that kind of thing.

Start time: 7968.12
End time: 7971.32
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  Well, no, they're not using it quite that.

Start time: 7971.78
End time: 7973.86
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh yes, they are. Read the article.

Start time: 7973.88
End time: 7981.84
Speaker: Stacey Higginbotham
Transcript:  They're using it to profile based on the car.  Are they using it because they understand that this license plate.

Start time: 7982.28
End time: 8011.57
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It records not only the license plate, but the make, model, and color of the car.  You got to presume they're recording that because the AI wants to use it.  They say it's because of what if people change their license plate?  But I don't think that's the only thing they're checking.  No.  Okay.  Anyway, anyway, that's a good question.  If you were a reporter, you might want to ask them that question.  Go down to the Westchester County Sheriff's office and say, dude,  why do you need to know if it's a rambler?

Danny said it hasn't really worked well for some time, as in some cases the information  was dated.  The related search operator allowed you to type in the Google search box and Google would  return related websites to that URL.  Oh, so you'd actually type in a URL and that would give you some other URLs that are related.  Okay.  Hmm.  Anyway, not going to be not going to be around if you use it.  Google is testing AI generated meet video backgrounds.  I'll be using those because we have our Google meets.  I like that.  This is actually a little interesting.  Google's Bard is now going to respond to visual prompts.  But companies like Google are very concerned about using this for face recognition.

It is great because I grew up in New York.  So this is the guy who built the Cross Bronx Expressway Riverside Park.  He turned Long Island into a park for the poor tenement dwellers of New York City.  But he did it by raising homes, cutting right through neighborhoods.  I mean, it's a fascinating story.  And I have to say, I really am enjoying it.  It's better than I thought.  Maybe because I know that.  You know the history. I know that area.  I don't actually know the history.  So that's the thing. I'm learning the history of an area that I know pretty well.  He built twenty seven billion dollars worth of public works.

Transcript:  You've blown it on Stacey.  I'm using you. I'm using you, Stacey.  She's tired. I'll be used in this case.  That's fine. I thought so.  I thought it would be in your interest.  So I'm going to go up the up the rundown here to the fact that  Vox mentioned earlier,  which made a big deal of building its own CMS.  Oh, this is an interesting story.  Yes. Got rid of the CMS and it's going to was it going to WordPress?  The V.I.P. And I did a thread where I went through.  I installed my first editorial system with the Chicago Tribune.  I'm this old folks in 1974.  And everybody thought they had to have their own special system  with their own special.  And that was their secret sauce.  Exactly. Because they thought too much of their value was in their content.  And rather you have to manage it.  We have a system to manage this content rather than they're making paragraphs.  That's all they were doing.  And so, again, I got into fights with this in San Francisco.  I got a timing.  The fights between the S.I.I. system and the A-TECH system were horrendous.  When I started EW, I left all of them behind.  And my wife set up our Macintosh network and we left behind all of that computer  junk and Macintosh became the standard until the came along the Internet.  And we all needed our special content management systems  because we're going to do special things on the Internet.  And, you know, Vox and Trey Brandrette, who ran product at Vox, was brilliant.  And then Mr.  was a great system.  And then Washington Post has its own special system.  And everybody built their own damn systems.

Start time: 8692.52
End time: 8713.80
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, worse than that, Vox was licensing it.  They were. Yes, they were.  Our system is so good.  As is the Washington Post.  You could buy it and use it for your.  We use Drupal for our content management system, which is an old CMS,  but we keep it up to date.  But WordPress now is almost half of all the Internet.  It's really started to win it all.  So have you.

Transcript:  They made something, you know, that and they they they did update the paper a lot.  It was Bezos putting technology in where they updated it a lot.  And they did build some other things like ad systems.  And they're now going to bundle that stuff to big clients with WordPress.

No, but you can use it however you want.  And for me, this works as a nice little pouch to carry some stuff around  if I want to go a little bit lighter.  And I could take some stuff out.  I just packed it full just as an example.  But because I mean, I don't really need this in here right now.  Or my microphone in here.  Or, you know, I don't really need all of that.
