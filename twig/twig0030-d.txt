It's time for Twig This Week in Google with the panelists here gathered today to talk about Google and the cloud.  But really the way Google's on a roll, I think it's going to be mostly Google.  Starting with in the upper left hand corner, Googler himself, Matt Cutts.  Good to be here. Thank you.  MattCutts.com. Matt works on the website at Google blocking web spam.  And actually I have a question for you that was raised I think on Twitter last week.  We'll talk about it about, well maybe it was on this show about this new form of journalism.  We'll talk about it in a second. But let me introduce the rest of the panel.  Also with us, Jeff Jarvis of BuzzMachine.com.  Journalist, professor of journalism and the author of the book, What Would Google Do?  Hey Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Professor always makes me feel so old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Professor Jarvis. Calling Professor Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The fact that I look at two doesn't help.  Graber Chorley, Greg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly. You're a young, young man.  Also here I'm glad to see Anil Dash is with us from Expert Labs. Hi Anil.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Good to have you. Great to have you back.  Now are you still at Six Apart as well or is Expert Labs your first?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No. I left Six Apart a little while ago to do this Expert Labs project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're going to talk about that in just a second because your newest, I don't want to say hire,  your newest person is Gina Trapani from CompleteWaveGuide.com.  Founder of Life Hacker.  Star of O Magazine.  So happy to be back.  Yeah. Sorry about your grandpa and I'm glad you're back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you. Yes. I was having serious twig withdrawal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Aw. Well yeah. Poor Gina missed the Buzz episode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh it was killing me. I listened to it of course this week on my phone and I was just yelling at you guys in my car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now you know how the listeners feel Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What did we get wrong Gina? What did we get wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no. It was awesome. It was a great show. But I was yelling about agreeing and disagreeing.  I was thinking about all the things I would have said. So hopefully we'll get to recap a little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. I think we're going to talk a lot about Buzz but there's also,  gosh Google has been so busy. But before we do that, a couple of days ago I saw a tweet from Anil Dash and then an article.  You've gone to work for Expert Labs.  First Anil, tell us what Expert Labs is and then tell us what Gina's going to be up to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sure. The lofty description of Expert Labs is that our job is to help policymakers make better decisions by giving them the tools and the technology to crowd source questions.  The practical part of it is, and the reason that we brought Gina on board, is we're going to make a technology platform that lets folks from the White House to all the other government agencies do what all of us take for granted.  If you're looking to buy a new phone, you can ask on Twitter or on FriendFeed for 100 people to give you feedback about what phone you should get.  Well, the president should be able to do the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think the president would have somebody, but I guess, yeah, but you want tech experts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they don't have the tools. They don't have good tools for it.  Fortunately, Gina's been building something like that with her Think Tank app and so we're able to sponsor that.  The great thing about it is we're not a government agency. We don't work for the government.  One of the things we can demonstrate is you can be a hacker and you can be a coder and you don't have to work for the government to work for your country.  That's a pretty exciting idea.  I like that.  Nobody in the world is better than Gina to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Gina, what are you going to be doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm the project director of Think Tank, which is this open source project, which I've talked about on the show before. It used to be called Twitterlitic.  This is my Twitter archiver and data crawler.  Yeah, so I've been working on this kind of nights and weekends for almost a year now, but we changed the name because we're going to incorporate information for more services than just Twitter.  And it's up on GitHub. It's free for anyone to download and try out and contribute.  Please, please, please. I need good PHP programmers to help me out.  And yeah, I'm really excited.  So I'm coding and figuring out ways to make it pluggable so we can add other services like Buzz and blogs and to just be able to have a place to kind of collect, you know,  collect your interactions on these social networks and make decisions based on the replies you get.  I was saying to Anil last night, you know, it's like companies like Facebook and Google can collect all sorts of information about you to advertise to you really well.  Well, I think that you should have the right to collect your own data, the data from your friends as well to put it to use for your own purposes.  So hopefully Think Tank is going to help do that in a little way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the most amazing thing here is the first customer for it is the White House.  They've got a project called Grand Challenges, which is trying to find the big scientific technology challenges facing the country, right?  Whether that's the next moon landing or the next human genome sequence.  And they want it, you know, the public at large to be submitting their ideas as to what those challenges are going to be and the platform that's going to empower this Think Tank, which is just incredibly exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's really neat.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me ask you a question, you guys.  The challenge, obviously, so far in the government trying to use the MyStarbucksidea, Dell Ideastorm kind of ideas platform was that it got gamed by the marijuana crowd so quickly and everything is gameable.  How do you get to the right people?  How do you get to the quality of discussion?  What's the way you're going to have to have this more qualitative view of discussion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll do a kind of first stab and maybe Gina, you can do the real answer with the technology.  But I was going to say, you know, to some degree, there's going to be people saying legalize pot on any question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not against that, but it was gamed by that.  So the problem is the whole thing kind of gets dismissed because, oh, yeah, just stupid stuff.  It's just pot.  And there are good ideas in there that need to bubble up.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so philosophically, we're not building a voting system.  So we're not saying a policymaker has to go with whatever gets the most votes.  And that's how they choose the policy.  If they're trying to find out what a big scientific challenge is going to be and a bunch of people say, well, the challenge is what can we do with hemp?  What they can do is they can say, I hear you.  I see that there's a bunch of responses there.  We take that in good faith and we put that there with a number next to it and saying how many people felt that way.  But that doesn't mean we're subservient to that vote count.  So then you move on to the next thing.  Yeah. So it's really about like we assume policymakers have good judgment.  And we think so much about these kind of contentious issues or the silly distractions of whoever has an axe to grind about some minor issue.  But the reality is most of policymaking is actually really pragmatic, practical stuff that is common sense.  And they just need more info to make decisions.  I don't know, Gina, if you have more to add than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, on the tech side, in the web application itself, I mean, my plan is to kind of make a long list of thousands of replies.  Something that's very easily filtered and curated by the people who want to put that data to use.  So imagine kind of like an iTunes smart playlist interface for the replies.  You can say, OK, roll up all the responses about marijuana.  We acknowledge these and we're going to put these here and we're going to put the total and make all those sort of filtering rules transparent.  So everyone sees how are these replies ranked and filtered and curated and to use lists.  So, you know, expert labs is part of AAAS, which is the world's largest scientific organization.  If we have a list of member scientists who we know are affiliated with the organization, we know that the answers are coming from people who at least identified with that organization.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So one more here, because Buzz is better with discussion, with conversation.  Is Buzz potentially a better tool for you than Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, possibly.  I mean, I think Buzz is definitely one of the services that we want to plug into Think Tank.  Definitely the behavior is different, obviously, on Twitter and Buzz.  On Buzz, people respond to one another in line.  Where on Twitter, because you don't have threaded conversations, you just get this big mass of replies and people don't see the replies that other people have posted in response to a single tweet.  So, yeah, I mean, Buzz does offer that kind of back and forth.  But Twitter can be used as well.  I mean, if the platform is able to reply back to all the people who asked about a certain issue and engage them in further conversation, which is something I'd like to do, then you can have kind of that similar thing.  Although Buzz displays those conversations, those back and forths, by default much more clearly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think the technology hopefully works with all these systems.  All of the above is the best answer.  And I think one of the great things about this is if we build a system that connects to all these, if Think Tank gets plug-ins to support all these networks, we start to see what each of the networks is good at.  That's actually a pretty interesting learning, too.  We have a grant from the MacArthur Foundation supporting this.  We're part of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.  The mindset in both of those organizations is just publish your findings.  Tell us what you've learned.  And if one of the things we learn is this network's good for this kind of conversation and this other one is better for this other kind of conversation, here's what you need to do.  Here's what Twitter's better at versus Buzz and vice versa.  That's pretty cool to learn, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It also brings in the scientific culture of problem solving, which we need in government.  Yeah, very much so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're at AAAS right now, right?  The both of you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The meeting.  The meeting, we're both here.  Well, Gene is always here in San Diego, but I'm not here.  And it's mind-blowing.  Last night we got to go to this reception to meet some of the folks here.  And there were three Nobel Prize winners in the room.  And you just feel like the kid at the grown-ups table is.  It's pretty amazing that being a geek can get you access to that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Expertlabs.org, not .com.org.  That's right.  And you can follow it at Expertlabs on Twitter to see what's going on.  I think that's really, really, really exciting.  So, Gina, you didn't get to talk about Buzz.  Matt Cutts, you didn't either.  Actually, let me have a question for you first, Matt.  I know your job at Google is anti-spam, you know, kind of people trying to game the Google results.  Do you work on spam and Buzz as well, or is that a separate kind of a business?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We haven't historically.  There is a central group that takes care of spam within Google that's not web spam.  And so typically that group is going to tackle it.  But the nice thing is that we do consult back and forth.  Right.  I wouldn't be at all surprised if I see some spammers to report it to them.  Even sharing best practices on things like spam and Google Maps can be really, really helpful.  Sharing the same sorts of tools.  So I saw my first Google Buzz spammer a couple days ago.  So that adrenaline starts pounding.  It's an icky feeling, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I block immediately when I see it, and I presume that by blocking I'm kind of signaling.  There's also, I think there's a report spam button as there is on Gmail.  I'm loving Buzz.  I have to say I'm using it an awful lot.  I know you do too, Matt.  Gina, you've been using it a lot.  What did you want to tell us, because you weren't here last week, about Buzz, Gina?  What were you yelling at the radio?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is the thing.  I like Buzz.  There are a lot of things I like about it.  I think there are a lot of problems with it.  I think there are a lot of ways that it can evolve and should evolve.  I do think that the fundamental mistake though with the launch was launching it in Gmail.  I understand that it got them a lot of users immediately.  But as far as I'm concerned, they needed to launch Buzz as a standalone beta product where people could very clearly opt in or opt out.  And even if it was a really short beta period, like four to six weeks, and just let the early adopters jump in and invite one another like Wave or like Gmail originally.  And these privacy problems that happened would have surfaced a lot sooner and would have been a lot less severe.  And then at the end of the beta period, even if it's a short beta period, even if it's a short testing period, then bake it into Gmail.  It felt like, I think Yuri described it as a bold move to me.  It felt like a foolish one.  And it felt like a kind of like, oh, we have to ship this and we need to get 140 million users immediately.  And that felt that was hard.  I mean, whatever.  I'm not going to rehash all the privacy stuff.  It was an alarming thing that Google decided to test this in-house with only Google employees and not extend it to their trusted tester program and just have it out in beta as sort of just a kind of test preview like Wave thing first.  It felt like, I was like, did they have some sort of, were they late?  Did they have some sort of ship date?  Was there some kind of deadline that they had to push things ahead?  I don't know.  And I won't put Matt on the spot.  But that all said, and the privacy issues were very serious.  And what Eric Schmidt said about it made me very nervous.  Eric Schmidt makes me very nervous in general.  Really? Which one of what he said, you know?  He makes me nervous.  You know, well, the things he said about privacy before freaked me out.  The old quote, which was, you know, well, if you're doing something you shouldn't be doing, you know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it.  If you need that level of privacy, maybe you shouldn't be doing the thing you're doing.  And then I think this week he said, well, no one was hurt, which is true.  Is true.  You know, meaning the buzz, the buzz privacy issues.  No one was hurt, which is true.  But you know what I really would have liked to have heard from him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We don't even know that no one was hurt.  So it may not even be true.  It may not even be true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But what really what I wanted to hear from him is what Todd said.  I thought Todd Jackson, the product manager of Gmail, I mean, I mean, the fact that he just came straight out and said, we are really sorry and we're working really hard.  And I have to say, I've been super impressed with with Google's response to this.  I mean, I mean, I think that Google is becoming more and more human on the lower ranks anyway.  You know, you're getting a lot more communication and a lot.  I mean, for him to come out and just say, we really screwed up and we're trying to make it better.  And I have to tell you, I know this is embarrassing and I don't think it's going to happen again this way.  So that's good.  It was learning experience.  But now the fact that Schmidt said, well, you know, no one was hurt.  What I really wanted to hear from him was we screwed up and we're sorry and we're fixing it.  And I guess that was part of the message as well.  But that all said, buzz makes a lot of sense.  I agree with you, Leo makes a total lot of sense.  It's a missing puzzle piece.  It ties together a lot of different services.  I like it.  It's still, you know, still a little, you know, some problems here and there.  It suffers a little bit from the friend feed.  Like this is too complicated.  What's going on?  What's all this stuff?  How did people get this in here?  Feeling.  But but otherwise, yeah, I'm like it.  And I mean, it's not Google Apps is my main Gmail account.  So I have to go to my regular Gmail account to see it right now.  So I haven't been using it as much as usual.  I mean, I connected my sites and then and that was it pretty much.  I'm using it more like a broadcast mechanism than a discussion forum right now.  But I think that'll change once I see it in apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Matt, do you have anything you want to say?  I don't want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, definitely.  I can I can mount a soft defense, which is, you know, I'll take your side on a lot of stuff in that.  You know, I remember whenever I joined Google and the stock price was very, very low.  And I went home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Rub it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why don't you?  It's germane to the end.  I want it five.  I really does.  It really does make sense.  I went home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not your best sympathy building.  OK, you know, I joined.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was ten dollars a share.  I don't know.  Let me start that over again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I remember whenever Eric Schmidt joined, he came to a TGIF and he answered questions  for like an hour.  Wow.  And I went home and I told my wife the value of our stock just went up by like a factor  of 10 because he was he was he clearly got it.  And I think he absolutely does get it.  So, you know, last year I think he was a little bit taken out of context because the question  was, can Google be your best friend?  And just the mere fact that any major financial news reporter can ask a large CEO  corporation, you know, can your company be your best friend?  Right.  That's that's in some sense a good thing.  And I think he had to answer in in the fact that, you know, in his capacity as CEO, that  said, all the people who don't like, you know, that answer, the Patriot Act is coming up  for renewal in like March or February pretty soon.  So that's a good chance for people to start to say, well, I don't want things like the  Patriot Act.  But but taking it back to buzz for just a second, the thing that I found that is the  most the best indicator of whether a team is going to be successful.  There's really a couple, but the primary one is how fast they can iterate.  The second one I would say is how well they listen to outside feedback.  And I think Todd Jackson and that entire team has done an amazing job of saying, OK, you  know, Google has gotten scolded on both sides.  They say, well, Gmail was invaded for five years, you know.  And on the other hand, I take the point about launching with a little more testing.  And at the same time, if you can get it live, especially a social networking sort of product,  if you can get that live where everyone can play with it, it's not on an invite sort of  basis pretty early on, then that lets you try out a lot of different things.  I'm already getting more reactions on some of my buzzes than on my blog.  I did a question like, well, who do you guys use for your domain name registrar and got  something like one hundred and twenty comments in a day or so.  Which of course raises the number one complaint people have, which is actually two of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which is how do I come out of I collapse these damn comments and and and then how do I keep  Matt cuts from rising the top of the page every day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, it's it's it's the scopal problem.  We should just call it that. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's not let's not blame Matt for it, because frankly, I'm kind of party to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yuri, I just saw in buzz while we were talking that Yuri put up a Google moderator page with  suggestions on how to fix buzz and votes there.  It's a perfect use of Google moderator, I think.  Yes.  To, you know, become recursive here in using the Google tool to fix Google and help provide  that kind of input that Matt just talked about.  And so it's on it's on the should be on the front page momentarily.  Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it's pretty clear that the team's responsive.  They immediately responded to the privacy issues and fixed that.  I think fixed that.  Although Google is being sued, there's a class action lawsuit coming out of Florida.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's that's what drives me nuts.  The prime, sorry, the privacy advocates come out of the woodwork and go berserk.  And I just think we've got to get over that.  And and at some point, you don't want to use buzz.  Don't use buzz. Yeah, I'm kind of with you.  Just don't use it. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it wasn't clear how to turn off.  I mean, it really wasn't easy to see how to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, but at some point, the immediate rush to sue and and and to claim that Google is  ruining all of life and the Internet has ruined everything, then fine, turn it off.  Right. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I'm kind of with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do think the other side of it when there's a new service is there should be a little bit of an internal  checklist process on this.  And I think, Matt, you and I have had this conversation where almost I want people to see the Google  dashboard of all their services on the way into the new service.  And it's the first time it pops up and says, here's a new service you can try out.  It says, by the way, here's everything else that's connected to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A lot of people didn't even know that Google dashboard existed.  So, yeah, I'm with you on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was announced almost like a project, a product.  And then we forgot about it once it wasn't new anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you go to Google.com slash dashboard, I think that's it.  And then you have to be logged into your account.  Right. I don't have a Yahoo dashboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't have a Windows Live dashboard.  It's a great thing. Just let me see it more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. So it tells you, you know, what Google services you're using, what your logins are.  And if you go to the Buzz section, it tells you quite a bit.  In fact, somebody was complaining, oh, there's no way I could see what people have liked  or what they've commented on.  It actually gives you a link to all of that.  So you could see what people are saying and what their most recent posts are.  This is, is that visible to other people or is that only visible to me?  Like this most, my likes.  That would be, that maybe something needs to be exposed publicly.  I don't know.  And yeah, I'm sure that the collapsing thing will happen.  And they've already fixed.  They say that the Google Buzz blog says we've kind of waited against these noisy people  rising to the top quite so fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. If you can take care of the Scoble problem and sort of.  I love it that it's the Scoble problem, by the way.  He's such a corner case, you know, he's got so many thousands of people that follow him.  But if you can take care of that, then suddenly things get a lot cleaner.  And the fact that they can do two or three pushes a week if they have to  means they can iterate according to that feedback, which is really helpful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is what I said actually last week is that if Google maintains its commitment to this,  this should improve very rapidly and become very powerful.  And you have the network effect built in.  You know, so many sites like this start and can't, you know,  immediately get enough people to make them useful.  That's built in.  I can understand why they launched in Gmail as bad as that was  because you've got the network effect.  You're ready to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and personally, the thing that not a lot of people have mentioned is enterprise  because we've been using it internally at Google for months.  And the fact that you can share articles just within your company  and discuss it there and get feedback and have ideas.  Brainstorm is a really useful way to use Buzz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was everyone in Google using Buzz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know whether everyone was turned into the beta, but there was a large number of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's so incredible that a secret can be kept that way.  I know.  Nobody knew about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was like, I mean, even Arrington didn't have this.  It was amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It just came out of nowhere.  It is impressive how many services it's plugged into.  When I first saw it show up on mobile maps, I mean, that was almost the first place I saw it.  That was pretty impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And three cheers for APIs and open standards.  Definitely.  We're very happy about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It seems like they've intended from the beginning to be very open about getting the data in,  taking the data out, getting RSS feeds of everything.  That's the embrace that you want.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, enough about Buzz.  Unless anybody has anything else they want to say about Buzz, we're using Buzz.  I'm actually, I think we're probably going to migrate from FriendFeed to Buzz,  although there's some features that we have like the FriendFeed rooms that are really useful.  For instance, we pipe all the stories we're going to talk about into a room in FriendFeed where people can comment on it and so forth.  And I don't quite have that yet.  But I imagine since this looks so much like FriendFeed, any feature that I had said from FriendFeed I'd like.  And how many of you follow Mashable and are going to stop because they just own the...  We were talking about this, weren't we, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't want to lose Mashable because it's so good and it's a good feed.  But that's a success problem.  Google better figure out fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, because Mashable always is on the top.  And because they're using it, first of all, because they have 20,000 followers, there's a lot of commenting going on.  But also they're using it as a news feed.  It's turning Buzz into kind of into a news reader with commenting.  It's a little bit like a Google reader exposed into Buzz.  The other thing that Yuri said in his blog post, which I didn't really kind of highlight last week and I should have, was that this brings in a lot of things we've seen as we've been doing this show over the last year, like latitude.  A lot of these little launches now all make a lot more sense.  The way the groups work in context.  Oh, now I can use groups when I post.  All make more sense because we've got a context around it all.  I think it's working quite well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The business, and I don't think we've begun to see the impact this is going to have on maps.  And thus on local and advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I put the Buzz layer on immediately on the maps in my phone.  Now let me ask you, Jeff, because I'm getting the feeling you're liking your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I've been making myself use it pretty much full time.  And I carry both, belt and suspenders.  But no, I am liking the Android more and more.  And I just downloaded some more apps today that made me happy that they were there,  like WordPress is there and other things that make me happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In fact, we're going to talk about one that you tweeted towards the end of the show.  A visit from the guy who wrote it, Daniel Switkin.  He saw your tweet saying how much he loved Google Shopper and he's going to stop by and talk about it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just for a bit at the end of the show.  He'll be available in a few minutes and we'll get him on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just a note, no developer wants to hear from a user, I'm making myself use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm forcing myself to use this damn Nexus one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've been making myself use it and it's not so bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, actually, no, Gina, the truth is you made me use it.  Yes. Blame Gina.  When you say Gina, I listen to you.  Blame Gina, it's her fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, there's an interesting...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Gina, as I say to my wife often, you're right, honey.  Yes, dear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you remember the...  I mean, it's a phone, not a treadmill, right?  Like you want to be enjoying it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I feel like it's more like a treadmill. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love that there was a couple posts by Jason Kincaid on TechCrunch and then Danny Sullivan.  And I think Jason said, you have to use Android for a while and get used to it.  And Danny Sullivan replied, I didn't have to use the iPhone for a while to get used to it.  True.  And there's an interesting point, but I think with the iPhone, I was using a dumb sort of feature phone before that.  And the Delta was so huge, you were just, of course, you're going to switch to the iPhone.  Right.  And Android and the iPhone are different.  It does take a little more time to get used to the Android system, especially if you've been using an iPhone.  But then once you get used to it and you figure out all the different ways to get to the more information  and some of the nice sort of open features where you can write your own apps for free, that sort of stuff,  that's where it really starts to get addictive for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I want people to go from a dumb clamshell to an Android, they never have a problem.  It's the iPhone and the Android that's hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, because they want the iPhone capabilities.  It's a totally different paradigm.  It's a different interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the iPhone to Android transition is definitely a rocky one.  But the clamshell to Android, my brother got Android phone after having, you know, and he's like, I love it.  He has no idea what the iPhone does or is.  The angels are singing.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The one thing that still gets me is the need for that millisecond to think before I hit.  Now, what does the search button do in this case?  Right.  I hit that button and I got this that time and that year.  It's the soft key problem, which fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Have you guys had problems with the keyboard being either touchy or off?  Like the digitizers misplaced.  It's just been a little funky.  It's hard for me to type on it compared to the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just my space bar drives me nutty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Space bar. You'll hit it by accident.  I hit that all the time.  And it's a whole new word.  I hit send all the time.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When sometimes when I find that my touches are off a little bit, I just tap the off, sleep it and then awake it again.  And things seem to recenter.  I also I've been using Task killer.  Oh, you like swipe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's it.  I love swipe.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I've been putting up with it keeps popping this dialogue because it's like an alpha, you know,  SWYPE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I can't just install that, right?  You have to do a fancy thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You just you go to a website to install it.  Like it's not I don't believe it's in the market.  And it's a test build.  So it keeps popping this dialogue saying like we don't support this screen resolution.  I deal with the with the dialogue all the time to just deal with dismissing the dialogue just to get the to get the keyboard.  It's much better for me typing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I will say to their credit is interesting watching the Windows Phone thing come from Microsoft where they will probably avoid some of the comparison with iPhone that that Android has suffered from.  Because it's such a different user experience model.  It's much more data centric.  And so I think that was a pretty smart move because I think Android is similar enough to iPhone that you end up making those comparisons.  And it's like if you're coming out with a new phone, the thing to do is to not be that close to iPhone so you don't suffer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Windows Mobile and they call it Windows 7 phone series.  Nicely named Microsoft Windows Phone 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Windows 7 Windows Phone 7 anyway.  7 series.  There's no live in the name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  Come on.  It's terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's the worst.  But anyway, that's not the only thing.  Yeah, maybe there's two things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, not a native English speaker, whoever names.  It's like what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it also doesn't follow in sequence because, you know, it has been Windows Mobile and they just dropped it.  You know, it's like, no, it's not mobile anymore.  What?  But anyway, it looks good.  Looks on paper.  Looks really good.  Has great social networking.  It's based kind of on the Zune, to be honest.  It's the Zune paradigm.  But we won't see phones till the end of the year.  So it's not a player for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just went to the Swipe site, by the way, and on the 15th they announced they got a million from Docomo.  Oh, the Japanese telecom.  And that they're launching on the T-Mobile My Touch 3G on Feb 10.  So it's their first official, you know, get it on the phone launch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the thing that just so you know, if you go there that's different is you don't tip, tip, tip, tap.  You move your finger around and you spell the word by.  It's kind of takes a little while to get used to, but it does seem more accurate, I have to say, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's definitely more accurate.  I don't like touch.  I just haven't gotten used to the touch keyboard.  I never liked it.  I didn't like it on the iPhone either.  And that's why I got the G1 because I really liked the physical keyboard.  And I still struggle with the touch keyboard on the N1.  And but now it's why you have to walk through the tutorial.  Like at first, you know, there are a couple of tricks they have to know.  Like if you're spelling the word good and you need the O to show up twice, you twirl around on the O and it knows to double it up.  I couldn't figure out how to double.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You go like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You go, yeah, yeah, yeah.  You twirl around.  So you move across the keyboard and twirl.  Yeah.  But now I've gotten really good, good with it.  And I, and I can't, I can't go back to that.  I'm going to put it back on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have it on here.  I downloaded it and the bug, it bugged me because it's that the pop up bug me.  Do you turn it on or off at will?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or is.  Okay.  Yeah, you can.  The other thing I've been doing is I've been using voice for search.  I haven't used it to post.  I use voice all the time.  Oh, it's so good.  It occurred to me the other way.  So we always, how many years did it take?  We thought people looked like idiots walking down the street talking on their.  I'm always going.  Now they're going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm doing it all the time.  Here it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Simply.  And I do it and I go, I am now at the eye doctor period.  And it does very well if you talk like that, but you look like a weirdo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're going to see that on the street real soon.  I think it's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As geeks, we think it's a good thing when the software has trained us what to do as  a post device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hey, as long as it works, I don't care if I have to jump through hoops, just make it  work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, give it five years and everybody will be doing that.  It'll be the social norm.  And if you see someone not talking into their phone, you'll think they're kind of unusual  or quirky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There'll be whole quiet cars on Amtrak where you're not allowed to use voice search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They already think I'm unusual or quirky.  Now, wait until you see me at South by Southwest.  We built a rig.  I'm going to wear a helmet with a light and a camera on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're coming.  You're coming.  Yeah.  We're going to be in person finally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's going to be fantastic.  We've never met, Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We have never met in person.  I know.  I feel like you're my internet dad.  Dad?  Dad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My uncle.  Your uncle, maybe.  Dad?  My uncle.  No, I could be your dad.  It's true.  It's sad, but true.  Granddad.  Grandfather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So we're getting a helmet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Colleen's building.  Because I talked to Scoble and he said, well, you can't really.  We wanted to cover it.  And he said, you can't.  The sessions are all streamed, so there's nothing to cover there.  And there's no like lobby con because there's too many venues, I guess.  So there's nowhere to set up and say, oh, come over here.  So he said.  Well, the whole thing is a lobby con.  Why listen to Scoble?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that was maybe my mistake.  He was trying to get me to dress up in a Super Dave Osborne suit.  But anyway, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That guy ruined Buzz, I heard.  Oh, him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The guy who ruined Buzz.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What am I talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So he said really?  Well, actually got experts here.  You tell me he's because I've never been.  He said it's about the parties.  I guess.  I'm not going to set up.  And I'm going to walk around.  Well, you don't have to worry about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I might get tired.  I mean, it's about the serendipity of the party.  I mean, it's about the serendipity of the party.  I mean, it's about the serendipity of the party.  I mean, it's about the serendipity of the party.  Okay.  That's good to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Anyway, I can't take Jake to all the parties.  It's illegal to do because he's too young.  Right.  If you were me, it's going to be telepresence.  If you were me, it's going to be telepresence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I'm going to walk around.  Well, you don't have to worry about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I might get tired.  I mean, it's about the serendipitous running into people.  I wouldn't go so far as to say it's about the parties.  Okay.  But it is also probably not about the panels.  Anyway, I can't take Jake to all the parties.  It's illegal to do because he's too young.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are we going to do our show from there, Leo?  Yes.  Since you're all there.  Right.  Well, you got to come to our kickball game.  Oh, I'm definitely coming to the kickball game.  The kickball game is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's a great idea.  I'm going to go to the kickball game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm going to go to the kickball game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So now are you going to be broadcasting live?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I have to do the radio show from there.  So I'll 11 to 2 Saturday.  I'll do the radio show from our Austin affiliate, but they're going to be broadcasting from  South by Southwest on Sunday.  So Sunday I'll be doing the radio show live there.  We'll do a twig live.  We'll find I don't know you all.  Maybe we'll have to make helmets for you guys too.  We'll have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, please.  So think geek has these little $99 cameras that have pretty good sound and record at  640 by 480.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And the record it's because I'm wearing a backpack with a live streamer in it that you  streams going to give us a live streamer.  So it uses and you know, I know there's no EVDO there, but it uses all four carriers  at the same time, hoping that one of them one problem is AT&T was borked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know.  So we have T-Mobile, Verizon, AT&T and Sprint all in one box.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Jesus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, all the time.  You never had a backpack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's crazy.  I don't know what I'm doing anyway.  Thanks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just like to say people are tweeting the fact that I just called you my internet dad  and I feel bad.  Now I meant that as like the deepest compliment, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know I'm not hurting the least.  What do you think?  You think I don't know that I'm an old guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Internet big brother.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Big brother.  My internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, don't say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Creepy.  For you, it's a good connotation.  I really meant mentor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not your mentor.  You're my mentor.  You can't.  That would be crossing the streams.  You can't do that.  Anyway, so moving on.  Oh, I was going to do a commercial.  Let me do a commercial and then I'm going to come back and talk about the fact that  Google's getting into the power business.  First they want to be a gigabit internet service provider.  Now they've got the go ahead to sell power.  What is going on?  Before we get to that though, let me talk a little bit about our friends at Citrix and  their product go to meeting.  I'm sure you've heard me talk about go to meeting before.  It is a really fantabulous solution for people who are stuck in conference calls.  You'd think with all this marvelous technology we've got right now, we wouldn't have to  be doing conference calls, but still I would say 90% of business happens over the phone.  There's a good reason.  It's really expensive to travel anywhere.  You got airfare and it's stressful and all that.  The whole idea is with go to meeting, you get the benefits of staying in your office,  not traveling with the visual component of a conference call.  You're on that phone call and you want to show a spreadsheet or a picture.  You want to show buzz.  You want to show a graph.  We do it on our shows.  We have a couple of hosts now who use go to meeting to show their screenshots during the  show because they're remote.  People can see what you're talking about.  It's great for an online meeting.  You can schedule it in advance or on the fly.  Everyone sees your computer desktop on their screen.  You can even trade it around so they see, I'll see your computer, you'll see mine.  Back or PC, doesn't matter.  You can give control so it's great for training.  It's great for sales presentations, product demos, collaboration too.  You could say, okay, let's work on this together.  Try it free for 30 days.  I know I'm not doing a good job of describing it.  It's because it's really very amorphous.  It can do whatever you need it to do, it will do.  Go to meeting.  It just replaces the business trip.  That's the key for me.  In fact, if I could figure out a way to do South by Southwest Viagra, maybe I will, Mike,  go to meeting.  Go to meeting.com slash twig.  Try it free for 30 days.  Go to meeting.com slash twig.  Go to meeting.  We thank Citrix so much for supporting our show.  Our show.  What is going on?  What's the deal?  Google, is this for themselves or are they going to sell electricity to other people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they said this a while ago when they applied for this because they're doing so much in  power.  At some point, regulatory reasons you have to apply for this right and they have it now.  They may well have surplus power at some point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They could sell power like a utility.  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has granted Google energy.  I'm telling you, we're going to look back on this and say this was, at some point, there's  critical mass where Google just runs everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm proud that in my book, which I haven't plugged in a while, I speculate about Google  becoming a power company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What would Google do about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they'd go get the regulatory approval to be a power company.  This is the best case of enlightened self-interest I can think of in business.  If Google through Google.org can lower the cost of clean renewable energy, it is a huge  boon to the P&L of Google itself and the world too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think there is a tension here.  There's only a few businesses that require regulatory certification in order to get into  them, power banks, a couple other things.  Which of those businesses, if any, would Google not get into?  Would Google finance someday grow to where they'll be certified as a brokerage house  and a bank?  Is there anything that they wouldn't say we want to be certified as that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Prostitution in Nevada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I wouldn't.  Why rule anything out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a valuable AdWords market there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Larry and Sergey have always been interested in energy.  Even a few years ago they had this thing called renewable energy less than coal.  So if you can get to that point where RE less than coal, that really changes the equation  in lots of ways.  So forever Larry especially has been one of these guys where you ask about a particular  type of fuel cell or something and he knows how many BTUs of energy it puts out.  So these are people that really do care about this and pay a lot of attention to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They talk a lot about the grid being messed up and how the more we put our brains and  our cars all on the grid, it's going to be a mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I want smart grids, smart cars.  I'm sure Google will be in all of this.  Why not?  It sounds like basically Google goes into anything that Larry and Sergey are kind of  interested in, they'll do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well Larry and Sergey have very wide-ranging interests.  Larry is sort of a true scientist in that he's happy to talk about all sorts of stuff.  And Sergey of course is a really smart guy too, but sort of random things that you wouldn't  think that they would be interested in.  Sometimes they surprise you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Google Gears, RIP, finally the end to Google Gears.  Gina, what does that mean?  Is it HTML5 that's replacing Google Gears?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it looks that way.  It looks that way.  Yeah, this is interesting.  This is interesting.  Anil and I were just talking about this last night.  Right now Mac OS 10.6 users are kind of left in the lurch because we're in this limbo where  a few Google apps use Gears and need Gears to give you some nice functionality, but they're  not developing it anymore.  So it sounds like it's not going to come out for Mac users.  On Chrome?  Well, yeah.  Because we were using it on Firefox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But no, it doesn't work on the current Firefox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The current version of Firefox doesn't have Gears support.  Doesn't support it.  Right.  I think that's just that they haven't gotten it done yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well in the blog post at the Google code Gears API blog, the title of the post is, hello  HTML5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean moving HTML5 is a good thing.  It sounds like right now we're just in a little bit of a painful place where HTML5 doesn't  offer the same kind of functionality, but moving toward HTML5 is a good thing.  What functionality is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I always thought of Gears as kind of the ability to use Gmail without being online, that kind  of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it more than that?  There's that kind of thing.  There's that.  And the one thing that I miss the most, Wave, you can drag and drop files into a Wave with  Gears installed, which I don't know if HTML5 would allow for that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Gears is essentially a web applications platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean it is a link between the desktop and the browser and an offline data store.  So HTML5 provides an offline data store, but I don't know if HTML5 would allow for  the kind of drag and drop file upload type of thing that Gears does.  I don't know, maybe Matt knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm pretty sure it does.  I think the thing that's interesting about HTML5 kind of philosophically is it is, you  know, all the other HTML versions up to four were really about making better documents  and HTML5 is about making better applications.  And so you have the data store.  I do think you have some of the drag and drop stuff.  One of the most interesting things in HTML5 is called workers.  And what these are is kind of background tasks that can run in the background in your web  app and be doing little things in parallel instead of in serial while you're trying to  make an application do something similar to threads on a desktop application.  And it's a really interesting thing, a little bit geeky, but the potential of that is huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How does this tie into Google announcing this week that it's doing a cut and paste to the  cloud?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's, well, I think that's kind of separate.  I mean, basically, you know, Google Docs just, you know, you copy something to your Google  Docs clipboard and it just creates a document snippet that's saved in Google Docs that you  can paste into another Google Doc in another window.  That's more like syncing your Chrome bookmarks up to reader.  You know, it's just another way to store a piece of data in the web app.  There's no, I don't think there's any conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What I wonder is why it couldn't, if it's storing stuff for the cloud, why can't it  store stuff to my machine and let me use it on my machine when I'm on the plane?  Security.  Yeah, I know, but that's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, yeah, you need to have a local API, a local storage API if you want to have things  like offline Gmail.  But what's really handy, I like what I like about the copy and paste, storing the information  in the cloud, you know, in Google Docs is it can preserve the formatting.  So I don't know if you guys have tried in the developer versions of Chrome, you can  do copy and paste and you can paste and a lot of the times the formatting stays, the  tables and stuff like that.  In fact, there's a plain text paste if you do control shift V in Chrome.  So that gets rid of all the formatting and only paste the raw text.  But even given that some browsers might not support that.  So by putting it into the application itself, you can make sure that the cells are maintained,  the formatting stays the same and you don't have to worry quite as much about what it's  going to look like on the other side when you paste it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Matt, how much are you using your Chrome OS machine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm using it quite a bit.  There is a new version of Chromium OS that's unofficial from a hacker called Hexa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, are you using the Hexa raw?  I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, it's called Flow.  The newest version is Flow.  The previous one was zero and it boots really fast.  You know, it doesn't work on all hardware, but it works on more hardware and it's just  very tight, very nice and very fast.  Everything's getting polished off.  And this is still basically, I believe, a 17 year old kid, maybe in the UK.  This is not even the official release.  So amazing.  Especially given all the security stuff going on, the idea of having a machine where your  OS is locked down, where malware can't even get to it is really more appealing in the  last few weeks or months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't do anything offline on that machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, not right now.  As HTML5 gets better and the local storage APIs take off, then I can certainly imagine  you could do things like offline Gmail.  It's just going to be a matter of time to march through all that progression of what's  supported in HTML5 and then in Chrome and then in the hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We can't remember what we're supposed to see.  That copy and paste is the kind of thing where I'd love to see an API.  That's where, if every app on the web can use an API, push and pull, copy and paste,  then we would at least be equivalent to where we were with desktop apps 20 years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wonder if you could use Salmon for that because isn't that the idea of Salmon as  a two-way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think some combination of that are PubSub and Pubub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Salmon is a little more to pull comments from different places that they have around the  web and make sure that they swim the backup stream to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it's not as generalized as that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But if I had clipboard clients for my Google Docs account and I push out my copy and paste  there, that's where we'd be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What I really want too is, I used to have this in all editorial systems, I don't want  just one copy and paste.  I want to have a copy and paste for every key on the keyboard.  So I can move this and this and this and this and this and then compile something together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We've had that on the desktop, Microsoft Office stuff for 10 years or 15 years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I think you might be able to get that with the latest copy and paste stuff because  it says it will store this in the cloud for a month.  So after a month, if you don't use something, it'll eventually get erased.  But that sort of implies that there's a certain amount of that that's still around where you  can, okay, paste number one, paste number two, glom these two guys together.  Until I retrieve it, do I get a menu of cuts?  I believe you do.  I'll have to double check it in Docs myself to see exactly how it works.  But I think that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you, Gina, ever solve your Google Apps?  We talked a couple of weeks ago and I think you got a car.  Somebody, someone did you call him Clyde McGoogle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Helpful McGoogler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Helpful McGoogler contacted you because here's the issue.  If you have a Google Apps account and you would like to use that for Buzz and have it,  actually that's not a problem using it for Buzz, but it's having the common contact list,  things like that to become a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you can't use it for Buzz.  You can't use it for Buzz.  You can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh.  Right, right.  Buzz isn't for Google Apps.  So there's a Google account and then when you sign up for Gmail, you get a Google account  with Gmail as your email address and you can associate any email address with a Google  account.  This is what you brought up, Leo.  I have five addresses.  Yeah.  Right.  You can't associate any number of email addresses with a Google account.  A Google Apps account is a Google account, but it offers a subset of Google services.  So only certain services, Gmail, Docs, Calendar, but it doesn't offer analytics, Buzz, Reader,  Voice.  Voice.  So if you have a Google account and then you say, hey, I'm going to use Google Apps because  I like this idea of it being tied to my domain, which is what I did a while ago, you can't  sign into those other services as your Google Apps.  So now I've been using my Google Apps account for years, for four years.  So all my contacts are very well developed.  I have my groups.  I have my most contacted list is the most true.  That's the one that really reflects my activity in my Google Apps account.  So then when I signed up for Buzz, it was this old Gmail account that I don't use anymore.  So you have these two data stores.  You have contacts in both places.  If you have a regular Google account and a Google Apps account, you have Calendar in  both places.  You have Docs in both places.  So that's the issue.  Google is just slower.  Just doesn't roll out new services like Buzz.  Although, I mean, when they announced Buzz, they said this will be out for Google Apps.  So that was an improvement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they're going to sell Buzz to the enterprise.  They damn well better soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  And it sounds like that's on the roadmap.  I mean, they said that from the get go.  So that's good.  But things like Voice and Reader are things that I really love to sign in with my Google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apps account.  I'm now investing in the account I don't want to use.  Right.  So I'm going to build up my profile and building up Buzz.  And I don't want that to be my main one.  I'm going to move it.  I'm going to have to abandon that.  Voice, same way.  It really causes a switch problem, even within Google.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If it makes you feel better, Google also runs Google Apps.  We eat our own dog food.  So we feel this pain as well whenever you have, say, a work account and a personal Gmail  account.  That's the sort of thing where we see that happening as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So how do folks work around it?  I mean, do folks just like, a lot of people just said to me, hey, I just forward all my  Google Apps email to my vanilla Gmail account because that's first class citizen.  That's the one that's going to get all the good stuff.  So do people internally at Google use their Gmail account versus their apps account?  Or does it depend on the person?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It definitely depends on the person.  I do take my personal email and forward it to my work account.  That way I never have to remember to go and check it.  But if you want to keep something completely separate like your reader account, the incognito  mode of Chrome is really helpful.  So Control-Shift-N opens up a new incognito window and then you can log in with that on  your personal Gmail.  So you can have two windows open.  One would be work, one would be personal.  It's still not quite ideal, but at least that way you can handle most of your issues pretty  easily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Good.  Well, there's a long post on smarterware.org where Gina explains what you can and cannot  do and it's worth taking a look at.  Any other stories you guys want to cover before we move on to our tool tip and number?  Pew Research says, or asks...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, there's my number, Leo!  Okay!  I'm not going to say a word.  I'm not going to say a word.  Geez!  I'm just teasing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One thing I'd like to mention is that Google created this thing called Living Stories,  Google News did, which was really in my view trying to school newspaper editors in web  presentation that it's not all about your static article.  You have to put an envelope of relevance around the news and you have to have things that  live on more to gain more Google juice.  So they created Living Stories with the New York Times, the Washington Post, Full Disclosure,  Daylife, where I'm a partner, is working on something that will go beyond this called  Smart Stories.  But Google just open sourced the Living Stories code so that other papers could use it and  I really think this is part of the strategy of making papers smarter, making news people  smarter because they keep on trying to shoehorn their old models into the new world.  So I think it's a good gift to newspaper folks.  Leo, I think it's probably also worth mentioning that we're getting more information on the  hackers who did the dastardly thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought that was kind of interesting.  The story which you bookmarked says, diverse group of Chinese hackers wrote the code, not  just one, in the Google US companies attacks.  This is Ellen Nakashima writing in the Washington Post, some of the computer code used in the  recent attacks in the networks of Google and dozens of other US companies were developed  by a diverse group of hackers from China, including security professionals, consultants  and temporary contractors.  This is according to an industry source.  Source also said some of the contractors were based at Chinese and US tech companies in  China.  Two schools whose servers were used were Shanghai, Jiao Tong University, kind of the Caltech  of Shanghai and Longxian Vocational School.  It's interesting.  If you believe this, the Chinese government is using their best and their brightest in  this effort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love this vocational school.  Hey guys, stop making new carburetors and let's go read Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They made it sound like there was a class.  I was like, okay, class, now we're all going to try and hack Google.  That's today's project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if you cause an international incident, you get an A.  Extra credit if you can bring down Microsoft too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One takeaway from any of this seems to be that security on the web just gets more and  more important.  When Chrome came out, people were like, you're going to update all the time without letting  us choose whether to update.  And looking back, that clearly seems like the right decision going forward or Chrome  OS.  The idea of locking down the OS and the data gets stored on a different partition that's  writable, but the system is not writable.  We're starting to enter that era of the net where everybody that's on the net has to think  about are your web servers patched?  Is your OS patched?  And if it's not, you might get hacked.  So those are the sort of decisions people have to start thinking about these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was a horrible wording at Davos of a Microsoft executive, I'm suddenly forgetting  who, who talked about licensing internet users, which I think was a horrendous wording.  And I don't think that even he meant it, but I think it meant more like licensing the machines  and making sure that they are drivable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well the interesting thing about that is we have, I think a lot of people have the conversation  about the iPad in terms of control Apple has of what applications can run there.  But we are getting back to the vision of Microsoft Palladium back in 2002 of this is the certification  of which applications can run and what can be in this environment and what they called  trustworthy computing or trusted computing.  And back then everybody thought it was the devil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you now have Jonathan Zittrain talking about how you really ought to have a partition  on your machine that one doesn't talk to the other.  You can have your sandbox still, but I could come to your machine and say I don't want  to play in your sandbox.  I only want to play on the Chrome side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well it's interesting that I think in this case what it was was just that the research  was right, but too far ahead of what people understood about the market and presented  in such a scary, creepy Orwellian way that everybody said hell no, I don't trust Microsoft  to do this.  And interestingly, we're at this point where apparently we do trust Google or Apple to  do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do trust them more than Microsoft, frankly.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't.  Don't trust anyone.  Trust no one.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I have friends at all three companies and I think they're all doing good work and  I don't trust any of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  Well, you could trust them today, but you don't know what the board's going to be like  in a week or a month or a year or 10 years and they're going to have all that data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, or if they have a bad quarter and need to make some extra money or whatever it is.  Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You always want to have your own data under your own control.  I would totally agree with that.  Right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's do our tip and tool and because we have a tipster and actually a toolster and I really  should give the tool credit goes to you, Jeff, because you tweeted it and got an email from  the guy who wrote it and he wants to be on the show.  So we're going to get Daniel Switkin on in just a moment.  But before we do, though, let's let Gina kick things off with her tip of the week.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sure.  I'm going to skip the buzz tip for now.  There's a link to the official Google blog with a few tips in the front feed.  I'm going to do something a little more obscure.  The Listen app for Android, which Leo featured, I think a few shows back, got an update this  week, a really good update.  You can subscribe now to your podcast in Listen on Android and it syncs those subscriptions  up to Google Reader.  So if you do the update and you search for and subscribe to your show, like I did for  this week in Google to listen to last week's Miss Show that I wasn't on, you'll see a  new folder in Google Reader that says my Listen subscriptions.  So it's got some nice cloud backups.  You can manage your subscriptions in Reader and they are reflected in Listen.  So that's a nice update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm a big fan of Listen.  That's how I listen to all my podcasts now.  So that'll be very nice to have that feature around.  And Jeff, your number.  Now that I didn't steal it from me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Pew Project for the Internet, which just does constantly great research on, we're going  to look back at its historians and they really are the best at trying to track how we're  using the Internet, how we're using online.  So the Pew Internet and American Life Project did a survey of a bunch of so-called experts,  I say so-called because I was one of them, 895 technology stakeholders.  And they asked the question that Nick Carr asked in his Atlantic piece about a year ago,  is Google making us stupid?  And I'm glad to see that 76% of respondents said that Google will not make us stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hey, there you go.  What do the other people think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The other 24%.  Yeah.  Will it make us stupid?  They were stupid, I thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, the heck with them.  Too much Google for them.  So we're going to get...  Google for you.  You tweeted this, I guess it was today, didn't you?  No, it was a few days ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I tweeted that the...  Because I constantly check in my Google News, Leo, to update the friend feed or soon buzz  and saw that the Google Shopper app is out and it's really darn good.  So I got a response from Daniel, the tech lead, to say volunteering to be on Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's get the Daniel, the darn good Daniel on the line right now.  Daniel Switkin.  Where are you, Daniel?  I'm in New York.  Well thank you for joining us.  Hi, neighbor.  You bet.  Yeah, he's just down the road a piece.  So if you have any shopping problems, Jeff, you're ready to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I actually used it.  I used it just last night.  I went on and I used the voice command to find something.  I won't say what it is because it was my wife's birthday.  Ah.  And she gave me the places and I was able to go to the retailer and I showed them my  Android and I said, I want that and they walked me over.  There it was and I bought.  Google got no credit for that sale except in that salesperson's mind, but it was very  useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There are a number of programs that let you take pictures of barcodes.  Savvy Shopper's been around for a long time from Big in Japan and some others.  Daniel, how is Google Shopper different from those?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's based on a lot of that work.  So I was the co-creator of the Zebra Crossing open source library and the author of the  barcode scanner, capital B, capital S on Android.  So Sean Owen and I, co-workers, started those in 2007 prior to the Android release and then  we open sourced those.  To my knowledge, they are the basis of all of the Android scanning apps, all the third  party apps.  So it's the same engine.  That's right.  In terms of the actual image processing, the machine vision stuff.  So then this, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sorry, no, I wanted to ask, I was curious about why Shopper and Google, and Goggles,  excuse me, are separate apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, because they're related, aren't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sure.  We're getting that a lot.  And I think a good analogy is the difference between web search and product search.  Web search, like Goggles, tries to solve the general search problem.  You can learn about anything, whereas product search is a vertical.  And Shopper is very much that way too.  Although clearly the apps overlap because they can both search by image, Shopper is  really about products.  So we let you shop by voice and by text.  You have the full history, you have offline use, so anything you've seen before is saved  locally, comes back up instantly, starring, sharing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there any use of the long forgotten, but I still use it, Frugal in there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, Frugal is product search, and that is our source for all the prices, reviews, specs,  etc.  I'm glad to see that.  We are very much building on the shoulders of giants with product data, with voice search,  with the machine vision that powers Goggles.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it seems like you had all the pieces together to make this in fairly short order.  Was it a big project to make Shopper, or no, you used the platforms available?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was actually a pretty big effort.  One key difference between us and Shopper is that we're doing continuous image recognition,  and getting that to work and getting that fast has been, it's really one of the things  I'm most proud of.  We're able to do about an image a second, even on 3G, just by holding your phone up,  that means continuously sending an image to the server, trying to recognize it and returning  a response every second.  Whereas previously there are apps like this, we're certainly not the first one.  SnapTel has been doing product covers for a while, and they use a still photo and then  they upload it and then a few seconds later you get the answer.  So I had a coworker who said, there's no such thing as too fast, which I really liked.  That is one of the central themes at Google.  The push was make this as fast as humanly possible, and we think it will keep getting faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's really neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So when are we going to see Goggles and Shopper for the iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No comment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just checking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why bother?  Just buy a Nexus One for crying out loud and get it over with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What are you going to add local to this?  I think that the opportunities for local on this are obvious and huge.  The  Oh Jeff, here's a coupon you want to know about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think Shop Savvy does that already, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They do have local features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Find a cheaper nearby kind of a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah absolutely.  It's something we're looking into.  We've also heard a lot of requests for UK support and other countries.  All of those things are interrelated now because if we want this to work well in the UK, well  it has to understand British accents.  It has to recognize British editions of book covers, British barcodes.  It has to understand and find local stores in England.  So the more search modalities that you have and the more data you present, the more difficult  it is to launch in a new locale because you have to get most if not all of them working  well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's cool about this is it isn't just barcodes.  You can do book covers and other stuff.  Eric got the barcode right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  There's something kind of unique which is we scan the barcodes locally.  They're running the image recognition running on the phone and we're doing the cover art  remotely on the server.  And one of the advantages-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This changes retail so much.  Well and stores hate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There are stores that will throw you out if you whip out your phone and start taking pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those days are over.  The opacity of market pricing is not going to last anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, they have to give it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was talking with the CMO of Best Buy who tweets quite a bit and they're very, very,  very smart.  And the thing I keep realizing talking to Best Buy is that a store has to become and  Best Buy is becoming more of a media experience and the value it adds is going to be that  they have experts so they know what's going on and they find the best stuff.  But the back end buying of the boxes is going to change pretty radically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One thing that I didn't expect is it's not only for comparison price shopping.  Something I've been using it for on my Nexus One that I didn't expect to is just building  a shopping list.  You run out of paper plates or something, you take a picture of the barcode just to  remind yourself it can be even faster than writing something down in a pad of paper.  So, you're going through the refrigerator or your cupboard and you're like, oh I need  a little more of this, I need a little more of that.  And you just put-  So Daniel, that's shareable too, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that I can put that in my family list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Currently, right now you can share individual products and you can share your whole wish  list but you can't, it's not a bi-directional sync.  It's just a one-time share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well very cool.  Daniel, thank you for telling us about this.  When did you join Google?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  About three years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay.  So did you do the Zebra library before you were at Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I started that as a 20% project while I was working on Google Finance and then it  just grew from there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's one of the things that Google does that's so smart is it's 20% stuff.  It's nice to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what's your day gig now at Google?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Shopper is my full-time project.  I've been working on this for about a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Fun.  Well it's great.  It's a nice addition to the Nexus One.  Congrats.  Thank you Daniel.  I really appreciate your time.  Daniel Switkin, who is the developer of Google Shopper.  So I'm going to make that my tool even though Jeff it was yours.  I'm going to steal it from you.  You steal my numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You steal my tools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I almost stole your numbers.  I'm almost stole your numbers.  There are a lot of great tools though on the phone.  I'll give you another one.  What new apps have you all downloaded?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll give you one.  Are you on Android and Eel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am.  You are?  I'm on a miserable old G1.  So I actually I just asked partially because I wanted to know and partially as a test of  the Think Tank application what phone I should get and I've been collecting feedback from  everybody across Twitter and Buzz and Facebook.  I'm still reaching consensus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can everybody share an app that they've downloaded recently that they like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can I mention that at TED they were all given Nexus One phones?  Yeah that was nice.  A lot of high end Nexus One users out there now all of a sudden.  They react.  Unless they regift them.  Well I wonder if Bill Gates is going to use his.  I somehow doubt it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They did the same at DLD in Munich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did they give Nexus Ones out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They gave Nexus Ones out and I'm donating mine to my school because I already bought  mine because you guys made me.  I got in the car where we drive from Munich to Davos and the two people who were in the  car I said you know I got a tip for this effect.  I said I think if we wait about a half an hour you're going to get a Nexus One.  They waited.  It was so funny to see the crowd just like kids getting their graham crackers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's like when Oprah pulls a car out from under your seat.  Well yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Until we get Google Motors.  Yeah that will be the moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've got a bunch of apps but nothing to recommend on my Android yet.  But the one I guess my mini tip is the Google dashboard mentioned.  We're very fortunate as consumers that Google's made dashboard for us and I don't know if  there's a mobile version.  I would love a mobile version of Google dashboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wonder if you go in the browser if you go to google.com slash dashboard if you get you  must get a small version of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah no I'm sure I'm sure it renders I just think as an as an app that's kind of giving  me a lot of status of my relationship with this company that would be kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah I think it's great that they do that.  I've been using a featured an application that was featured called a loquat.  Have you seen this one?  A-L-O-Q-A.  I hate to do a featured app because I figure everybody probably already knows about it  because if you I mean I go to the market every day to see what's what's cool and new and  different.  Well yeah.  Farrokh Schmidt could not know about what was it he didn't know about.  He didn't know about Google Sky.  Google Sky.  No he didn't know about layer right.  No layers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry layers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're right.  Layers.  I hope he'd know about the Google.  Exactly.  So a loquat is a is a kind of a local application thing.  It puts up a punch up pumps up a bunch of icons onto the screen that are based on your  locale.  I've got what's hot in my area Yelp restaurant.  So it's kind of like all in one last FM music bars and clubs playing tonight in the area  housing Wikipedia entries in the area ATMs in the area pizza fast food but you can shopping  but you can add other channels.  There's additional channels on this.  It's a free app and it's kind of a great all in what's kind of like where.  Which I also use kind of great all in one.  It's taken a while to find the other ones but location based app.  I really I really enjoy it.  A L O Q A and hot will tell you what what there's a lot of activity going on.  So the hot pads dot com has a couple of great houses for rent.  Here's somebody playing at the Phoenix Theater in town and here's another one.  Kate Garibaldi is playing live somewhere nearby.  So it tells you it's I just it's exactly.  It's a very good application of local search that I think is very easy to use and very  intuitive.  A L O Q A.  What about you Gina.  You got something you like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well I swipe as I mentioned earlier is my favorite.  Yes that's a good one.  Yeah.  Yeah I'm not I have to say that I'm not a big.  I haven't looked I haven't got any really new apps lately although I've really been  enjoying the on the Google home page is a web app is it is an app in the market just  on the Google dot com home page that near me link is pretty pretty neat.  Just seeing stuff that's going on nearby.  But but but yeah no otherwise I've just got my kind of regular I've gotten into my groove  I've gotten into a rut.  I got to start looking in the market more I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well I told you about tune wiki I really like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like the Thomson Reuters news at Thompson Reuters news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yep that's a great one.  There is a Ustream broadcaster now so you can actually shoot Ustream live streams with  your phone and the camera is so good on this phone.  I have to say I really enjoy taking pictures with it.  Yeah if you've got buzz don't forget to open Google Maps and turn on the buzz layer because  then you can embed your pictures into the map and then when you've got the buzz layer  turned on doesn't not a lot of people buzzing in Petaluma but when I was in San Francisco  there's a little buzz things everywhere all around and that's kind of fun too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Matt cuts thank you so much.  You have you have a pic before you before we let you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh boy I'm such a you know Android a holic.  So there's an LED scroller.  I got to get that.  What's that.  That one's just LED scroller.  There's a really fun one called Tri Quarter which is just a way to see all the different  sensors on your phone.  So for example if I go like that you can actually see the shape accelerometer.  Doing stuff like that.  But I have to say my my favorite app lately is one called app referrer.  And all that does is it shows you a list of all your apps.  And if you press a given application it will display it as a barcode so that your friend  can scan it.  So now you can do peer to peer sharing like if someone were to take a picture of that  screen with their barcode scanner which Daniel Swift can you know wrote you were just had  him on the screen.  Now they can install that application without having to look in the market at all.  So I can give you you know if we want to trade LED scroller apps I just hold it up.  You take a picture with your phone and you're good to go.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's clever.  I hope people are writing all these down because I didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not writing them down I'm downloading them as we talk.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Sorry about that.  Me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know I didn't ask you and I meant to ask you Matt we had a big conversation on Twitter  this week about something called demand media which is a very you know about it I guess.  And it's a very interesting way it's really to me it seems the way to game Google by creating  with kind of you know barely adequate content in a niche area to drive traffic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  Demand media has been a very divisive polarizing thing because they had this article come up  in WIRED that sort of portrayed them as very low quality content.  And of course if you listen to demand media they say that no no we're very high quality  content and we're a way that freelancers can get you know a reliable source of income.  So yeah 20 bucks a pop.  Yeah you have to work pretty hard to get it.  So from our perspective we've tried very hard to reduce the amount of web spam which means  that the bar to do well on the web has gone up a little bit.  You always see people who will try to produce the bare minimum of work or the bare minimum  of content to try to do well.  The nice thing is that you know and your position on demand media depends on a lot of different  things about your opinion.  Within Google we have seen a lot of feedback about people saying yeah there's not as much  web spam but there is this sort of low quality mass generated content where you know it's  a bunch of people being paid a very small amount of money.  So we have started projects within the search quality group to sort of spot stuff that's  higher quality and rank it higher.  You know and that's the flip side of having stuff that's lower quality not rank as high.  So I think if your business model is solely based on mass generating huge amounts of nearly  worthless content that's not going to work as well in 2010.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So rather than just playing black and white with the bad stuff you're trying to curate  better the good stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah you definitely want to write algorithms that will find the signals of good sites.  You know the sorts of things like original content rather than just scraping someone  or rephrasing what someone else has said.  And if you can find enough of those signals and there are definitely a lot of them out  there then you can sort of say okay find the people who break the story or who produce  the original content or who produce you know the impact on the web and try to rank those  a little higher rather than just trying to push down everyone that's bad because news  alert there will always be more bad people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's a challenge for Google News as well and I argue that in the link economy  it becomes an ethical matter to link to content and journalism and news at its source so that  you can support it by links because that's how you get the support.  I've interviewed Stephen Kidd from Demand Media and Sean Kolo I ran a panel with him  in Munich at DLD.  I think it's important though Leo to recognize that Demand Media has a key insight that's  a lesson for the rest of media.  It's oneilearnitabout.com where they really look at their Google queries all the time  and say oh look people are asking for this, they're asking this question, we don't have  an answer, let's write it.  In my old days of media we decided what questions to ask and so Demand just does that algorithmically  and they look at the highest demand for content and the highest demand for advertising and  put it together and I don't blame them for that.  I think it's very smart.  My theory though and I want to see if Matt checks me on this, my theory is that the more  Google goes to personalized search that takes the signals as I talked about in Buzz to find  out where you are, who you are, what you do, the less SEO as a dark art can succeed in  making that kind of mass produced, cheaply produced stuff succeed because everybody's  search becomes different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Definitely personalization and things like local search results even by metro rather  than even by country sort of take a monolithic set of search results and break that down  into a bunch of different search results and that's a really good thing.  You don't want to be competing with every plumber in the world, you'd rather be competing  with the plumbers in your nearby area and then that's good for users because they get  local plumbers as well.  So I think that's the way that things are going.  There's always going to be a need for evergreen really useful content.  Some of the most red comments or red posts on my blog are things like how to hack the  iPhone was a post I did several years ago and what Firefox extensions do I use and that's  useful for people across the world not just in individual places but increasingly if you  go to Google and you type something like bank, if you're in the UK versus Australia versus  the United States you really don't want Bank of America in Australia and you really don't  want other countries banks if you're looking for something that's really relevant to you.  So personalization and all of those sorts of things means there's no longer one set  of search results you can bookmark and someone in Topeka or someone in Transylvania will  see the exact same thing as you.  Now it's much more diverse, it's much more useful for individual local searchers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm glad I brought up the subject.  I don't want to get too long a conversation.  We'll just have to have you back and we'll talk more about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Leo if you want to have the people from demand media on too they're very public  about it and open about it and willing to enter the debate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think you make some good points.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My full disclosure here too is I was asked to be an advisor and I turned it down just  so that I could maintain my independence in talking about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's where Sol Hansel ended up going right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, Sol Hansel is doing the equivalent at AOL called SEED.  The Paid Content had a conference in New York on Friday and they kind of had all these together  at one place which is AOL is doing this trying to find new quality ways to do it.  Associated Content does it, Suite 101 does it, Demand does it and About does it, each  with a different model but they're all trying to create content to be on the other side  of a search query.  Very interesting stuff.  But here's another important thing that happens too and then I'll stop is that we talked in  the past about the spheres of discovery.  The brand, the old media brand was a sphere, search was a sphere, algorithms were a sphere  and now the importance of Twitter, Buzz and Facebook, that is to say human recommendation  of content as a means of discovery I think is very important to get past this notion  of spam and content farms and if people are recommending things which is what's happening.  We're all going to Twitter and Buzz now asking a question, getting an answer.  The more you can capture that value, I think the less of this content farm, chaff is going  to be a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
