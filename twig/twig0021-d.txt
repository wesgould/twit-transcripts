Joining us right now, it's great to have him from his garden lair.  Kevin Marks of British Telecom, former Google and former Appler.  And I'm from now on going to introduce you as the father of podcasting.  I think you deserve that credit, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One of the many fathers, I think.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The first one to demonstrate a working podcast client.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, that's true.  Right?  So, I mean...  The first one to demonstrate one that got onto the iPod, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's pretty darn good.  So, we owe it.  By the way, the Electronic Frontier Foundation has decided to fight that bizarro podcast  patent.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I sent them a bunch of stuff for that as well.  And I know Dave and the others were too.  Yeah, I think that's...  Thank goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The person to whom you're trying to reach is currently unavailable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that would be Jeff Jarvis, who will be joining us a little bit later on.  Jeff.  Jeff switched from Wi-Fi to Ethernet and it seemed to work fine.  And of course, I said, well, at some point, it's not going to work.  Your Mac will suddenly decide, wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  He's pulled the rug out from under me.  And in fact, that's exactly what happened.  He was on here a minute ago.  There we go.  Now we've got him.  Right you were.  It always happens.  Always.  We were talking about the fact that Kevin is one of the fathers of podcasting, this  medium that we're using right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And plus Adam Curry plus Dave Weiner, we must be forgetting, true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, yeah.  Yeah.  But he predates both.  Well, actually, in a sense, Weiner gets credit because he put the enclosure in RSS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Weiner had it working inside radio and it would download the stuff for the hard drive.  The thing that I did was put it onto the iPod.  So that was the edition I made, which made it, which I think made a difference.  I think so.  Yeah, yeah.  Just a little.  We were also talking.  I now need a good one for the Android.  And what I'm doing now is downloading them and copying them over.  I think I need to write something for the Android.  You don't use listen?  It doesn't seem to do what I want.  Maybe I should play with it again.  What do you want?  What do you want?  Well, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, before we do that, I better bring in Gina here.  Yeah, bring in the others and then we'll get to find out what you want.  Jeff Jarvis is here from BuzzMachine.com.  Great to have you, Jeff, the author of What Would Google Do?  And Gina Trapani, who is the author of The Complete Guide to Google Wave.  Hello, hello.  And is waving from Brooklyn, where both she and Jeff are about to get snowed under by,  I think it's 20 inches of snow, you're expecting, almost two feet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  South of us, I think in Washington.  I think we're up here, Gina, we're more like what, 12?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  12, I think.  I don't know.  I feel like every time I look at the news, it gets higher or lower.  Who knows?  It's exciting, though.  Snow angels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Weather is snow angels.  Are you going to run out and do snow angels?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's been a few years for me with snow, so I'm excited about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to admit, I haven't been in snow in a long time.  That's always the first thing I do is fall back and go, wave my arms and wave my legs  and make an angel.  It's pretty pathetic, isn't it?  And people in California have no idea what we're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In Brooklyn, you have to do that right away because as soon as the snow is on the ground  for a couple of hours.  It's yellow soon, yes.  That's lovely.  It gets yellow pretty quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what is it?  We were talking about podcasting and Android and Listen, which is Google's application  for podcasting.  I've been using that, but do you think it's not adequate, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, maybe I knew I needed to give it another chance, but what I want is slightly more subtle,  which is I want it to give me stuff and to keep track of that and feed that back.  I think part of this is stuff offline while I was commuting and that kind of thing.  But now I want a bit more from it.  I want to have the ability to comment on it.  I think there's more to be done there, making it more interactive and more two-way, the  way Twitter and the other...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You mean you want it to be not just download stuff, but you want it to be kind of more  real time so it's getting the programs in real time.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, not quite real time.  No, I like being able to time shift, but I want to be able to react to them.  There's a nice thing called Huff Duffer.  Have you seen that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  This is a whole new way of thinking of podcasts to me.  To me, podcasting was, I thought, a way that you subscribe to a show so it appears on your  iPod at some time after the show comes out and you listen to it.  But you want something much more interactive.  So what is this?  iDuffer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What is it called?  Well, Huff Duffer.  Huff Duffer, H-U-F-F-D-U-F-F-E-R.  What it does is it gives you a bookmarklet, and every time you find an audio file you  like, you bookmark it, and it creates you a podcast of those files.  And then you subscribe to that and you listen to them later.  So that's quite nice.  So that means that as you wander around and find things, you can share them there.  So it's like a, it's kind of like a delicious audio.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't have to be a podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It doesn't have to be any MP3 or audio file.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It just has to be audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  So that, I think that's the beginnings of this.  I think when we started with the podcasting thing six years ago, there was always the  thought of how do we make it easier to make these?  That is a bit easier now.  We have tools that help that.  But I think there's also, there's still more we could do there to make them more interactive  and be able to respond to pieces of them and so on.  So I think there's space there.  And some of that plays with my thinking about voice stuff when I'm at BT and telephones  and voicemails and things like that.  I think from stuff that is coming at you and stuff that is two way to this, this partially  asynchronous conversations, I think that's going to start getting interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I would add a third piece to that, which I'd like them to be more discoverable, easier  to find.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If we get all three of those working, we might actually have something here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo, you've talked about saying podcasts are kind of over and videos, what's next?  Actually, I don't believe that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I believe that, far from it.  Far from it.  In fact, audio is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Over is strong, but you're changing your...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't by any means think that audio should be replaced by video.  I think I'm a big fan of audio and for most people, audio is a much easier thing to consume  because there's a lot of time in the car and places where you can't watch video.  But what I do think is that podcasting hit a glass ceiling about two years ago and I  think it was mostly an issue of discovery, although I think some real time stuff would  help as well.  But I think people just don't, can't find them and have stopped looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the same problem I'm having with apps now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there's so many apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a filter failure problem.  I argued last week in a post, we'll talk about it later probably about demand media and the  kerfuffle around that, but when you have overabundant content, the value of curation is what increases.  And solving what Clay Shirky calls filter failure is really the key challenge we have.  And it's been the case since the internet came out, so Yahoo tried to do what Google  does, but it's something you can never catch up with.  Whenever we have something new, you have too much of it too quickly.  Podcasts, Twitter, whatever.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's exactly what Huff Duffer does because you basically compile as a curator,  you compile a podcast of audio stuff that you find interesting.  So I would basically follow your Huff Duff, right, Kevin?  And I would hear what you think is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You get a bunch of audio that I like to look up, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love that.  I love that idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll put the show on it as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The problem with that, of course, is that podcasts are way too linear.  You can't skim them.  You can't find stuff in them.  You have to sit and listen to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There was an interesting day we had with NPR a month ago or so in San Francisco.  They got together a bunch of people to talk about these ideas.  And something they're doing very nicely is they're chopping their shows up into segments  and they're putting them in a show.  And I think that's interesting and important.  I think that will help a lot as people start doing that rather than saying,  OK, here's an hour-long package.  It's like, here's the five-minute story, the next five-minute story,  the next five-minute story, and you can skip over the ones you don't want.  And that creates a useful signal that you could then go back and share and say,  here are the stories I listened to this morning from Morning Edition.  And if Jeff does that and Gina does that in New York for me,  then by the time I listen to it in California, I can get the interesting ones from them.  I don't know where you put that.  You see the build, not just the story, but you also see the ability to link directly,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to deep link into audio and video.  And it becomes more possible now when you have the text coming on to the new automated  subscript coming on to YouTube videos.  But I hate to be a killjoy, but how am I going to make any money at this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because there go all the ads.  Right.  Well, I think it's a similar thing of blog discovery, right?  With blog discovery, you search something, you find something in the blog,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  you read the blog, and then eventually you subscribe to the blog.  I think it's the same idea that you'll subscribe to the people,  you'll subscribe to the story.  That was always the thing.  I think that's right too, Kevin.  I think it's the same with being able to search books,  and you find an interesting thought in a book,  and you're more likely to buy the book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think, Leo, the more your stuff is searchable,  our stuff is more likely to be more searchable.  And I think that's the same with the search of the book.  I think, Leo, the more your stuff is searchable,  our stuff, I should say,  the more people can go directly to a thought,  the more you have discovery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you're right, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It just goes to the argument, you don't want to sound like Rupert Murdoch.  Try the accent again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't link in deep linking to my podcast, mate.  Right.  You can deep link to my ads, but not my podcast.  Well, I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Eric Smith said last week, or two weeks ago in his Wall Street Journal op-ed,  that he's giving publishers 100,000 opportunities a minute  to establish a relationship with someone.  I guess the hard part, you can see that easier in a text page,  because you can have relevant stuff around it,  which is kind of the live story structure they're trying to go to.  In audio, it's going to be harder,  because you don't have a parallel stream of content in a way.  Someone's just hearing it.  You can't put an ad next to it or a link next to it.  Well, that's...  But making it...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can do a five-second intro.  Yeah.  Say Gina, go ahead.  Say Gina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could do a three-second or five-second intro,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  thanks to so-and-so, and then before you do the five-minute segment  or the ten-minute segment.  I mean, the nice thing about splitting up a show like this  into five- or ten-minute or fifteen-minute segments  is that people can embed them and comment on something  that we, you know, particular stories,  that we talked about.  And if they say embedded them on their blog,  you know, if there was some way to sort of automatically include  some sort of, you know, five-second intro.  I'm absolutely not adverse to that.  In fact, the only reason I don't do it is just the manpower issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's enough for us just to get these things out.  What I'd love is a tool that would make this possible  for end users to do that.  In fact, we inquired if there were a way for a Flash server to...  You could indicate in the Flash player, jump to this minute,  and it does really help.  Flash player jumped to this minute,  and it does require a special server to do that,  which we don't have access to.  But that would be a great solution where we could just give you a mark  and say, you know, here's where Gina starts her conversation about Wave,  here's where Kevin starts his conversation about Huff Duff,  and then people could go right there.  And I think that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Those permalinks allow people to gather around them.  Right.  And say, wow, that's a good argument about Wave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It depends how you're posting it.  There are chapter markers in MP4.  Yeah, and the reason I don't use that...  You skip to them.  Yeah, it takes your work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's AC, it's this enhanced thing,  and it's not only extra work, it doesn't work in a lot of players.  I'm totally up...  Believe me, I'm not against this at all.  I was being a little facetious in the ad thing.  I realize that our number one job is to get people to find  and listen and consume our content.  We can worry about the rest of it later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, YouTube allows for this, right?  I mean, you can chop out segments of a video on YouTube  and watch just that segment.  I know at least there's two...  I think it's called TubeChop.com that lets you single out  a particular segment within a video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's timely because we are now on YouTube  thanks to you, Jeff Jarvis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yay!  Awesome!  So you can link into a timestamp at YouTube.  Yeah, you can do that.  I'm not sure you can set an out point,  but you can certainly set an in point.  Yeah, it has to have a specific kind of Flash server,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and then you can say, jump to this position.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  YouTube, I think you put hash T equals and then a time,  and then it jumps to that or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I would encourage all of our viewers to start doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sorry, I was just going to the YouTube page, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, if you go to YouTube.com slash twit,  we have a twig channel, we have a twit channel,  a twiff and MacBreak Weekly and Windows Weekly,  and we'll soon all be there because Jeff Jarvis  called his friends at Google.  You're all going there now, okay?  That's fine.  Sorry.  I'm not going there.  Don't go there, man.  Jeff Jarvis called his friends at Google,  and we were awarded whatever this is,  this special account that allows you to upload full length stuff,  and it's fantastic.  This is awesome.  Yeah, it's in high quality,  so I hope you'll start embedding this on your website.  I'll go play with that.  It's cool.  Yeah, we're very happy.  No doubt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's the twig channel?  I don't see anything under slash twig.  No, slash twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's YouTube.com slash twit.  Okay.  So it's the whole network.  We're all there.  We're all in one, and then there's a twig playlist,  which I think is sufficiently granular.  Yeah, that's great.  Yeah, that's fantastic.  I'm totally going to embed this.  Yeah, and it's high quality, and so we're glad about that.  It's interesting.  When you first upload it, it's low quality,  and then I guess Google is, you know, choose on it,  and then it becomes high quality.  So yeah, it's pretty cool.  I'm very happy about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the high quality code takes longer.  Yeah, I would gather.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're not uploading in high def,  but boy, the high quality does look good.  So I'm just, you know, what I have to do is I have to do some work  on this page so that we can have an easier way  to find the playlist and stuff.  But this last week's show is up there on twig, and it goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And thanks for their due to Steve Grove at YouTube,  who's in charge of the news and politics channels.  Thank you, Steve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you.  Boy, that's great news, and thank you, Jeff, for pulling strings.  It's nice to have friends in high places.  So, but not live streaming yet, and, you know,  I think in some day we will have this ability to just say,  hey, here's the relevant issue, people for people to blog it  and so forth.  This is kind of the problem in general with audio and video  is that it's just non-linear.  I mean, it is linear, rather, and it's not easily searchable,  and it's not easily linkable to a small part of it.  Let's move on.  You like Charlie Strauss' 21st century phone pieces,  I see, Kevin Marks.  That's an interesting thing.  Yes, I thought that was very good.  Did you have a chance to read that?  I just saw your link just now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's from anti-pope.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google, I'm sorry, Gadget Patrol 21st century phone.  This is in a product review.  It's a big picture overview.  So what is, he's talking about the phone of the future,  or is that the idea?  Yes.  So his basic thesis is that the cell phone companies have

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  been trying really hard not to be commodity pipes,  whereas Apple and Google have an interest in them becoming  that, especially Google.  So that's the sort of overview of it,  but he's got some very good analysis there.  If you don't know Charlie, he's a brilliant science fiction  writer.  He's written a whole series of great ones,  some comedy ones, and he was at the Hugo this year.  He wrote a near future one called Halting State,  which was about the future of the future.  And he wrote a book called Halting State,  which was about five years' time in Scotland.  There's a bank crisis in an artificial bank  and a bunch of stuff like that.  So he said this is from the Halting State world.  This is his prediction that effectively what Google is  trying to do with the phone is turn the cell phone carriers  into a mere pipe so that they're a way to access the internet.  That's his analysis.  And I think there's a fair bit of truth in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He says, Apple is an experienced company, a high-end mark.  They destroy the telcos.  They just want to use them as a conduit to sell their user  experience.  Google is an advertising corporation.  Their whole business model is predicated on breaking down  barriers to access, barriers which stop the public from  accessing rich internet content plastered with Google's ads.  We've said that before.  That's all Google wants.  They just want a better internet because it's a better  delivery medium for their business.  So he says Google want, Google want, I want to say wants,  but he must be British.  Google want.  Oh yes, he's British.  I knew it because they just always get that.  Companies in Britain are collective nouns.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google want the mobile communications industry to  switch to version two pure bandwidth competition.  In fact, they'd be happiest.  I promise he switches back and forth because now Google is  they again.  In fact, they'd be happiest if the mobile networks would go  away, get out of the user's faces and hand out free data  terminals with unlimited free bandwidth.  But that's not going to happen.  And it's the same thing that's happened with cable and  television companies like Comcast.  They, of course, there's all this pressure for them to  become pure bandwidth companies.  And their response to this is there's not enough money in  selling bits.  We have to sell premium content.  Exactly the same position the telcos have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why do you think Google wants the white spaces to become  super Wi-Fi?  Right.  So we finally get, we get competition in that and we get  other opportunities to get bandwidth and when, or the idea  that bandwidth becomes a right in this country and that we,  you know, see what happens there.  What comes out of that?  If we just imagine a world of truly ubiquitous broadband, I  was talking with a consultant I'm going to blog about next  week about the postal service.  And you start to see a world where you really don't need one  and how much money do we all save in the economy from that?  There's all kinds of implications to having.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you guys, I mean, you're starting to sound like crazy  hippies because there are huge commercial forces in this  company pushing just as hard back in the other direction.  They don't want to go this way.  Do you think this will happen inevitably anyway?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think so at some point.  The value to Google is so great.  I can't find it.  I thought I had put up a link to a post going through the  economics about how Google could give away the Nexus One,  its alleged phone for free.  And it's not hard to get there.  It's easy to get there with advertising.  And it's not hard to get us bandwidth for free.  It's it's, you know, it's hermaphroditic economics.  You don't know who's doing what to whom these days.  So what's our consensus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is Nexus real?  Is Google starting in January going to sell a phone and  undermine its partnerships with Verizon and T-Mobile?  Oh, I hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It appears that that's what's going to happen.  It sounds like January 5th is the it's not confirmed,  but that seems to be the date coming from a few different sources.  But it sounds like Google, by the way, Google says, no,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  we're not going to do this.  We're not going to compete with our our channels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they're going to set it up to say, oh, you can you're going to have to use this on a channel and you can use it on a channel.  You just do so without a contract.  So you think they're playing language games?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they've been selling phones for over a year, right?  They sold the G1 as a developer, a developer tool.  And the Nexus one may be the may just be the next evolution of that.  People are jumping to conclusions or they may have some other plans.  Well, that's the question.  For over a year.  And there are other ones you can get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. But how many they've sold a few thousand.  I mean, it's it's de minimis.  I mean, T-Mobile doesn't care.  Verizon doesn't care because people aren't going to buy them from Google for 300 bucks when they can get us get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And if you need to put a statement that you've got to pay, you've got to buy that from the anyway.  So right. They make their money.  You can use them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now I can take my iPhone.  I wouldn't I wouldn't buy the the droid before because I'd have to commit to twenty four hundred dollars and then would I spend four hundred dollars, five hundred dollars even for Nexus one and swap out my SIM card for my iPhone?  You bet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Huge opportunity for T-Mobile here.  If they could get their high speed data network everywhere and say and they've already said this, they've already got the you know, you don't have to buy a phone from us.  You can go month to month.  We'll give you a flat rate.  This is a this is a chance for them to go to fifth from fifth to first, at least with the geeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But will they do it?  It's going to be interesting January.  And they do it.  So, yeah, that's you know, I have to say looking at the Nexus one.  Have you played with one, Kevin?  It looks like a really nice phone.  I haven't seen one yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Looks spectacular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, anyone who's actually seen one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have talked to we talked to somebody who's played with one who is very impressed.  He said it's in fact the general response from people who've played with them is surprisingly snappy.  I think it's a nine processor cortex a nine in there, which is the fact also the report of the quote weirdly large camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And my theory on this is that it will improve Google Goggles.  Is that is that true?  That is a big camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I saw that weirdly large.  That was from TechCrunch.  Nobody else has confirmed that.  And my friend who played with one said it was completely just like a droid camera.  So, you know, five megapixels.  It's five megapixels.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And it has flash.  I think Google Goggles works fine with a dry camera.  I think that's what you need.  What the key is not megapixels.  It's autofocus.  Apple showed that with this three two is that autofocus is a key for things like reading, you know, these barcodes, these shortcodes and for scanning and text and and logos.  I wasn't that impressed with goggles after playing with for a while.  Really?  It doesn't.  Oh, really?  Yeah, it does.  It's not very.  It's not very.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I wanted to work on faces.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the need I have.  So do I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Badly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is coming.  Really?  You think so, Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was at an event that was supposed to be off the record.  I won't say who said it, but it was a certain high level executive from a certain company said, yeah, basically it's almost there.  It's just a ticklish thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I got an email.  I got an email, a very angry email, because I said the same thing.  And I said, look, the government already has this technology.  You know, let's put it back in the hands of people because, you know, the feds got it.  Of course.  And I got a very angry email from a person who raised a very good point said, I have a family member who was assaulted because a stalker was able to find information about her on the Internet, including her home.  Do you really think it's such a good idea for strangers to have a device that they can say, oh, that girl's cute and find out everything about her?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the problem is, Leo, we always come back to this.  Can you take any given device and say that it could be used to do harm?  And then we live to the lowest common denominator.  There is a risk at anything.  There's a risk to kitchen knives at some point.  But the power of visual search is incredible.  Yeah, it's huge.  Absolutely incredible.  And the power of search around an annotated world.  Do you tell me about this place where I am?  Tell me about this thing I'm holding.  Tell me about this person I'm seeing.  And also let me comment on any of those things and add information to the world about those things is so damn powerful that, yes, I understand the risk.  There is risk.  There's risk to privacy.  There's risk to a lot of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the thing is, you know, we're already doing this, right?  We're already doing this with Picasso and Facebook and iPhoto.  We're already annotating all our photos of our friends.  If you just search that, that will be useful to me.  If you just said, OK, this is that person you met last week in Paris, that would be really handy.  Love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I love that feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe that's what they do.  Maybe they don't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe they don't do it in real time.  You have to snap a photo.  I mean, I think there's a firestorm, however, facing Google if they do this.  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's why they haven't done it.  Oh, definitely.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They know that.  I think that there's some way you're going to find the power of it.  I wrote a post this week about trying to put together, Gina wrote a wonderful post about 2009 and all of Google,  and I did my bad version of it, trying to just put together all these things we talked about last week and see where this heads.  And you start to see the idea that the search becomes visual and oral, right?  Google gets better and better and better at sound search.  The fact that Yelp and such, we'll talk about soon, I'm sure, becomes an effort to get social around something local.  It becomes really powerful in ways that I don't think we can even imagine yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But, Gina, you're the sole woman here.  I mean...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It creeps me out.  It creeps me out, the idea that somebody can take a picture of me and get Google search results for my name, because it's scary.  I bookmarked this last week and we never got around to talking about it, but Eric Schmidt was quoted,  I think it was in that Google special that we all missed that aired on CNBC or MSNBC.  I guess he was asked about privacy.  What about people who feel like they want privacy and they don't want any company to have so much information about them?  And he was quoted as saying something along the lines of, if you need that kind of privacy, then you probably shouldn't be doing the thing that you're doing.  And that just, that really...  Yeah, that was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, by the way, I know we didn't talk about it on Twig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know we didn't talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, exactly.  We didn't talk about this on Twig, but we did talk about it on Twitter the next day.  And in fact, the name of that show is Schmidt Happens.  And I think appropriately, and that's exactly the point I brought up, Kevin Marks.  We had Jason Howell from CNET on it.  I said, wait a minute, didn't Eric Schmidt embargo CNET for a year because they published details that they had found on Google about Eric Schmidt?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  That was three years ago, right?  Yeah.  When that kind of attitude is going on, it scares me a little bit.  And as someone who has had trouble with harassment online, I don't want...  I have a private mailbox that I use because I don't want anyone to be able to find my address.  I use a Google voice number so to mask my actual phone number.  I'm, like most people, kind of a freak about where I enter in, kind of identifiable information.  But more and more, I do it and we all do it, right?  Because the balance between risk and convenience, the convenience you get for the risk is often outweighs it.  But still, the idea that someone can take a photo of me from wherever without my knowledge, which you can do in public very easily,  and do a Google search result and get my name back and whatever search results there are, it freaks me out.  Then again, I mean, if someone has my name, which isn't a stretch, they can Google me just by typing it in.  So I guess it's not that much of a leap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They can go to Facebook and see you standing in a crowd and have no connection to you, but see you annotated, have your name, and then go.  I mean, I agree about the creepiness level, but I think that there's also...  What you end up with at some point is you have the law of the land works across any medium and any technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we know how well that works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have to worry about that more. I think there needs to be more stalking laws and things like that to enable us to be...  Because the issue to me, I always say, is in privacy, it's control.  I need to be able to control my information, control how it's used, control the connections I have with people, and give me control over that.  And if I don't, that's the problem.  You know, you go to other issues like what I've talked about here before, the theory of mutually assured humiliation,  that we all have embarrassing things, which I think is what Schmidt's really saying.  If you really have something embarrassing online, then that's probably the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but if you're the guy who has the least embarrassing things online, then you win, right?  Well, that's not the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're supposed to become the dullest person on earth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe. I don't know.  And nobody cares about you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I heard a story I listened this morning to this week's on the media, the public radio show,  and they had a segment from a guy who was giving a funeral for his name.  He had written a story, I think, in the Harvard paper about picking up closeted college jocks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it was very popular and it rises to the first of search.  But now he wants to be a fourth grade teacher.  Too late.  So, nope, he's legally changing his name.  And so his mother is there crying about not being able to use his name,  but hoping that sometime this won't matter as much so he can start to do it again.  But he held a funeral party awake for his name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe he shouldn't have done that.  Yeah.  I mean, look, in a couple of weeks, we'll be arguing whether Google should have cross references to previous names.  I mean, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  They didn't use his real name on the piece.  Let's call him Peter, they said.  Yeah. That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you change your name and change your history?  Not with face recognition.  Face recognition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but the other issue about that is that in blogs and now in news, we argue that you don't erase your mistakes.  You cross them out and show they were there.  And that that's the ethical thing to do.  To try to change history, we don't consider ethical in the blog world, right?  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody in the chat room said, you know, you could always just ask somebody their name.  It's called socializing.  No, no, no.  No.  No, we don't want to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Line letter 2601.  But who are you really?  I find it interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've had two subjects here.  In both cases, there is a lot of pressure from one group that wants this, which is either cell phone carriers or cable companies becoming pure bit purveyors.  The other being Google giving us face recognition.  There's this force in one direction and there's this force in the other direction.  It's very interesting how these tensions arise in this new in this new world where you have very and I think very reasonably these are really tough things to solve.  And I'm not sure how I would go on this face recognition thing.  I mean, I think they're both good arguments in both cases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's what's the next step here?  Right.  You can if you have a photo that exists of someone.  And the first step is the annotation of it.  So if I don't know Gina at all, she's among some people.  I think who the hell is that?  Somebody says that Gina Tripani, I can search that created a connection that wasn't there.  Gina could have tried to be very private.  That's the issue of Facebook photos and annotation.  Right.  The next step is whether or not with that photo that already exists, I could do face recognition to find out who that is.  I can do that today.  There have been services for the last couple of years been promising that the next step that we're talking about here is only that I can snap you in person and find out who that is.  At least there you can see me doing it.  Right.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The thing is, you can.  There's something comforting though that you'd have to ask someone else who I knew or who was in the photo with me who I was.  Or one of those people would have to.  Not necessarily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, the thing is your face is well known now.  So you could you could mechanical Turk it.  We could put the photo up to the Amazon thing and say, who is this?  And someone could go around and say, oh, that's Gina.  I recognize that.  Jonathan Zittrain was talking about this at Supernova.  He says there are police are doing this.  They had a big photo of a bunch of student protesters and they were putting the faces up on Mechanical Turk saying, do you know who this is?  We'll pay you 10 cents to go identify the people in this photograph so that we can serve them with a with a arrest warrant.  So, you know, this is this is the difficulty is that you can now use these other tools, these distributed human based tools to do this stuff that the machine based stuff can have a go at, too.  I mean, the machine based face recognition isn't that good.  I mean, we've all played with the car and and and the the photo one and so on.  And mostly it's sort of it'll get some of them.  It'll get the ones that you say, OK, this is Kevin.  It'll find the ones that look very similar to that.  But half the time it'll say my son is me or my other son is me or something as well.  Yeah, that's true.  Whereas the human based stuff on Facebook is much more like, no, that's Kevin.  Even if it's me with a funny hat on or something, people will be tagging me with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess you're right. In some ways, this is not this is a genie that's going to get out of the bottle one way or the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So we have to deal with our education.  We have to deal with our laws and our cultural views of this.  And rethink publicness and privacy.  I think it'd be a mistake to go to a complete lockdown on privacy because as Lenin 2601 just said, we do want to socialize and we want these connections to happen.  We can't be ruled by the one possibility that something goes wrong.  We have to be cautious about that instead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, the other thing I think.  Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sorry. Go ahead, Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Dana Boyd spoke at both Supernova and La Web about this, which is that we are now publishing more and more of their lives online, but we're still not using that to do good, using that to find people and help them.  And that was that I thought that was that was a really strong point.  I disagree with you saying she said there were powerless, you know, there are powerless people who put stuff up online and nobody pays attention to them until they do something bad.  And then suddenly that all over them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I disagree with that.  And I unfortunately will raise the specter of my penis again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At least it's going up.  OK, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Incredible things happen. Wonderful things happen.  I couldn't that couldn't have gotten the support and the information that I got back if I had not chosen to put myself out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's certainly benefits to living in public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Her point was that there are people who who aren't as sort of privileged as us, right, who who who don't feel safe doing this because they don't have the ability to hide from the bad people effectively.  And that that was I think that that if you had a chance, watch Dana's talk from Supernova, La Web, I think both of them are up online.  Really recommend that as a as a corrective.  It certainly made me stop and think about what we're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I mean, that's no reason to say, well, stop putting stuff online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, no, no, I mean, I think Jeff Jeff made the point originally is that the thing is that the authorities already have it.  They have the ability. I suppose that's potentially what Schmidt was saying, too.  He says they're the government. They have nuclear weapons.  They can get the data from us if they force us to write.  That's that's the bottom line. It comes down to that.  And the challenge is, can we then give that data to ourselves and use that for good as well?  Can we if we can get the information ourselves and use it, we can probably make more sense of it than than a random stranger can because we have some idea of who our friends are and what's going on.  There's an interesting related issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to there's a thing called the Personal Genome Project and Harvard geneticist George Church is doing this.  They want to collect 100,000 genomes and match it to phenotype information, weight, height, baldness, medical history, that kind of thing.  So it's a very valuable database so that they can figure out perhaps what gene expression has to do with some medical history and that kind of thing.  And they say they do an interest. I've volunteered to that. I'm going to do this.  Esther Dyson has done a number of people have done it.  And what they say in this is we're not going to protect your privacy.  We can't. So you should know that you're forever more your genotype will be in public along with your complete medical history and your name.  We could have make an attempt to protect this, but we know that we're not going to be able to do it.  So we're just going to not even try.  And so when you volunteer, you say, yeah, OK, fine.  And maybe that'll make it hard for me to get insurance down the road or whatever.  And one of the reasons I'm doing this, not only to publicize it, but because I don't have much to fear from that.  And I think people need to know such a valuable database.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you create value with it. I argue in my book that we get to the point where not sharing data becomes seen as antisocial, quite literally.  23andMe has a survey out about your reaction to H1N1.  And at some point by sharing more of this data publicly, we're going to find correlations that we couldn't have found before.  But we can only do that if people are generous with their data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe that's what Schmidt was saying is we need to get over this stigma.  We're stigmatizing information.  And now some of us, like you, Jeff, are kind of pioneers in this area or obnoxious about it.  Whatever. Well, I think some of us have less to risk than others.  You know, if I were Gina, I wouldn't do this.  If I were a woman of any stripe, I wouldn't do this.  That's why the issue is control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  You don't need everyone to do this. It's the Wikipedia rule.  You don't need every human on earth to give their experience here.  You need a statistical number who are generous enough to share it to get them out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or exhibitionistic enough. Yeah.  So let's talk about Yelp, because this is the big rumor now that Google is planning or offering or thinking about, and it's not confirmed by Google,  to spend half a billion dollars to acquire Yelp, although in conjunction with Google Goggles, it makes a lot of sense.  Jeff, do you have any knowledge about this? Is this going to happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No knowledge. I mean, Michael Larian, Reading Tech Crunch is where I start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mike, by the way, has a history of rumors like this that never pan out.  So I'm always a little bit skeptical. I love Mike, but I'm always a little, you know, like, OK, well, that's one data point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's interesting to me because what I said was watch out or put it another way, newspapers and phone companies lost this opportunity.  They could have owned this level of information that Yelp has. They should have. They had it.  It's like communities. And so there's great power there.  And I think that the next frontier for Google, besides the things we talked about last week, like more intent and search, is local mobile.  And that Yelp gives them an incredible amount of data for local venues.  It improves the place page, which improves maps, which improves navigation, which improves local advertising.  And they bought AdMob. Yelp is also potentially a back door to social.  I'll be curious to hear what Kevin and Gina say about this, because it's an opportunity to say that you're I saw one post that I think I put up on the friend feed.  That wondered whether this was a side way to get to Foursquare and that you're talking about places and you're gathering around places and giving that data and people are doing it.  And that it's a social thing as well. So I think that's less important.  I think this is a huge opportunity for Google in terms of local and it and it has been newspapers and phone companies and yellow pages to lose.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Any thoughts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the yellow pages have lost it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's amazing to even know that people are still chopping down trees to print these ridiculous books that nobody can use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does anybody use the yellow pages?  Or maybe we're just early in the, you know, there's still people using it.  But considering how well Donnelly is doing, the other publishers are doing, no, you're right, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody's, somebody's.  Gina, you're the youngest one here.  Oh, yeah, she's the youngest one here.  This sounds kind of sad, but yellow pages were part of of how we found information.  Were they ever for you?  Do you even know what they are, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, they're part of like, they're part of like how I reached the really tall shelf in the kitchen.  I mean, you know, I really never remember using the yellow pages in earnest.  Even when I first started to use the phone when I was like eight or nine, maybe, I mean, but not not very much now.  Or even a phone book.  Anybody use a phone book?  Like a paper address book.  I had one of those for a while.  Remember they put it in white pages, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, white pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, me and my friends would go through the white pages and try and find like funny names, you know.  Yeah, that's what it's good for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When prank calling was kind of, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do they still print the white pages?  Yes or no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Am I wrong?  They still print white pages, right?  I guess they have to.  There's got to be a set of the population that's not online.  Boy, that really shows you why, in fact, being online is a human right.  Because it's not long before you're not going to get that stuff.  That's why France did Minitel, right, in the 80s.  Was so that they didn't have to print, you know, yellow or white pages.  They saved money and brought more people.  They gave everybody a free terminal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's where I think, Leo, that's where I think if you really go to the full extent of the rumor mill  and go beyond Nexus One to the latest rumor that also comes back that Google's going to do a Chrome OS machine themselves,  at some point it's worth it to give everyone in the country a machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why does Google need to do hardware?  Because they can? Because they can give it away?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because I think it changes the economics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They could just say, we're just going to give it away.  Talk about disruptive.  At some point, the federal, the US federal government is going to just say, you're breaking too many businesses.  You know, you're not a monopoly.  But I mean, is there a societal consequence to a company like Google that is so disruptive to everything we know?  I mean, they are putting everything on its head.  Or is this another case of...  It's not Google, it's the internet.  It's the internet.  Well, that's my question.  Or is this just a case of inevitable and we just better...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There are already, you know, companies that give away devices, right?  In the UK, you can get a netbook that you don't pay for.  You're just paying the subscription fee for the connectivity.  That's been out for a couple of years.  Yeah.  These exist.  And I'm not sure anyone's doing that in the US, but that may just be because the carriers haven't really come up with it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Most of the time you get these onerous two-year contracts and that is enough.  People have quickly realized that that's actually a huge cost of thousands of dollars.  And I don't think it's...  You know, you can get a netbook for 50 bucks, but you have a two-year deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google would say, do we really want government to come in and set these rules?  Right.  Sorry, Gina, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was going to say, this is what I want to see.  I want to see Google just stop this stupid contract madness and, you know, make this actually work for users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With one stroke of the pen, they could disintermediate the phone companies.  They could put the netbook manufacturers out of business.  I mean, they could change the landscape.  You see, Leo, you're operating...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You are playing back what we hear so often about, well, Google destroys something.  Well, that's the economics of entitlement at a corporate level.  That's the sociopath.  It's the sociopath thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Aaron Schwartz calls them sociopaths.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This thing, in Craig's list, stole from them.  Right.  Craig is the grandest philanthropist who left money in the pockets of the trans actors and took it away from the middlemen.  So who's to say that we should suddenly protect some old industry from Google or the internet and make life worse for consumers?  That's absurd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Aaron Schwartz says, naturally, the sociopaths are outraged that their control is being taken away.  Newspapers, book publishers, television companies, ad agencies, their businesses are all failing.  While Google's is on the rise, the sociopaths may be outraged, but this is exactly what's supposed to happen.  Most people don't have a vested interest in whether ABC does well or even continues to exist.  What they want are good television shows at a reasonable price.  And if they can get those from Apple and Google instead of their local cable company, bully for Apple and Google.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, Gina, you're rooting for this to happen.  And if government stepped in to stop it from happening, you'd be enraged, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but definitely.  So really, though, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It would be protecting businesses and screwing up consumers.  But wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Government represents businesses in the same way it represents individuals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to bet that Kevin Marks studied that at Oxford or Cambridge or somewhere.  Tell us.  Physics.  Physics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Physics.  It's not going to help you.  Your physics is no use here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, companies are legal persons in the US and to some extent in the U.S.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And government protects property.  Let's be very clear.  Government really doesn't protect individuals.  It protects property.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Except that we have a political will.  The problem is we don't have the lobbyists.  And so that's why the political structure is broken is because we don't have the people,  common cause aside, don't have the lobbyists to fight for that against revolution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're talking about revolution.  This is a revolution.  This is an economic revolution.  Yes.  The question is whether it'll be a Velvet Revolution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the problem is this.  It's about things getting smaller, right?  It's about a deflation that occurs when everything gets cheaper.  And that's innovation and Moore's law makes everything cheaper today.  And that's not the way the economy was built.  The company was built on centralized control and making things more expensive and what the market would bear.  And you charge as little as you can bear now to be as big as you can be.  And it changes the fundamentals of economics.  And I did horribly in economics class.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  George Gilder wins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, Umair Haq.  Have you been reading his recent stuff?  No, tell us about that.  So he was he's saying basically a lot of the businesses that exist are not creating value.  They're just moving it around and extracting some of it.  And he says his bet for the future is on businesses that are creating actual value by returning it to the people who are using it.  So that is the craziest example is a good one there rather than charge, extract the most money from from brokering it.  Craig made sure that most of the money went to the people using it.  The other thing that that sort of leads to this was John Hagel stuff at Supernova, where he was looking at return on assets for companies since the 60s.  And he basically said it's been going down.  What's happened is they're not making money from being large anymore.  And any money they do make is either extracted by the customers as better value or by the individuals within the company who extract it as wages.  The corporations themselves aren't keeping it anymore.  And in order to effectively the sort of old, cozy and theory of the firm where a firm exists because its transaction costs are lower is no longer true in this age.  And it's easier for us as individuals to lower transaction costs collectively than it is for a company to do it bureaucratically.  That's a big change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if Google does something that, yes, destroys an industry, but the benefits all of us in huge ways, the industries are going to scream like pigs.  Stuck pigs as they are.  But do they really have a right to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  But I but I and I think if they only did it one Z to Z, probably they could get away with it.  They're about to do it.  Got a wholesale.  And I just I have to you know, the only thing that's going to save them is that Congress and the federal government is completely clueless.  And by the time they catch on and of course, the sociopaths don't believe it's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So by the time where the problem here, Leo, is I asked Eric Schmidt about this at the Aspen Ideas Festival this summer.  And what he said was the change isn't going to happen as fast as you want Jarvis because the resources of government in terms of money and regulation are favoring the incumbents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's kind of what I was saying.  Yeah.  But I think that's disinformation that Eric Schmidt is handing you, Jeff Jarvis, because I think I think Eric Schmidt knows exactly how quickly it's going to happen.  And his sole goal at this point is to stay as stealth as he can for as long as he can so that it will be too late by the time the vested interests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what I made a genius post this week about 2009 and about our discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What a year this has been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You start to add it up.  It's all inspiring.  Each one is rather stealthy.  Each one is rather stealthy, is rather small.  Okay, so they did this, they did that.  You add it together and it starts to show to me, maybe it's just my scales on my eyes, I start to see the strategy come into clearer focus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I'm with you.  And I think if you don't listen to this show, you may not, it may not become clear.  But when you, just from doing this show, and we've done 21 episodes, and I guess Gina, you knew all along, but it's become extremely clear that we are in, this has been a transformative year.  And it is accelerating rapidly.  Was that your point, Gina?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's unbelievable when you look, yeah, I mean, when you look at what everything that Google has done in aggregate in 2009, it's really crazy.  I mean, I think the three main launches of the year.  It's happened faster in the last month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What were your main points, Jenna?  I mean, the end of the year, they were busier, it seemed, than the beginning.  Yes.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.  Continue on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off.  No, no, that's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, the three big launches of the year, which from where I sat were Wave, Chrome, ChromeMOS, and Android, you know, the Droid, Android 2.0, were actually, you know, for the regular consumer, not exactly, you know, earth shattering.  A lot of people still aren't on Wave, and ChromeMOS was just a demo.  I mean, that's not even out, you know, and the Google Experience release build isn't even out.  The Droid is still very, you know, not very widely used.  And it's interesting to me, and I love it as a developer, that these are all open source products that are out earlier, you know, that are out for developers to play with and for people to try out, you know, before the actual final release with the exception of Android.  ChromeMOS and Wave are still really preview.  But I think that they, you know, lay this groundwork for the next few years.  That's going to be pretty incredible, pretty incredible stuff.  I mean, we're moving really entirely into the cloud, entirely into real time, entirely into having these powerful computers in our pocket that can do so many things on, you know, on a fast network.  I mean, it's this this year was a big one, even though, you know, regular Joe Schmoe isn't going like, oh, Google blew my mind this year.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, Joe Schmoe has no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, except that's where I picked up from where Gina was and tried to patch together the discussion we had last week.  And I looked at it in two ways.  The first is Google getting closer and closer to intent on search.  And that's why goggles and visual search matter.  And voice search matters.  It's why the thing that last week amazed me, the search for weather in CH and you get the weather in the search box before you even ask the question, they give you the answer.  So that's one area.  That's their core area.  But then they've got to move past search bit.  Bitly, you know, it grows by the minute because human links grow by the minute.  I'll get to my number of the week in a minute.  But then you look at mobile and local.  And that's where, you know, I wrote this before the Yelp thing even came up to start to see where they they get to the idea of knowing we're going to have a constantly connected device and what all they can anticipate and give us in there.  And then as a result, target the hell out of us for advertising.  And it's a beautiful thing for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Essentially, I think where we're headed is a heads up display.  Somehow that that basically, you know, it's augmented reality that is at every moment giving.  I mean, we're very close to that.  Google's very close to be a full time connection to Google.  And just look around you.  Google says, what do you want to know about?  Yeah, I could tell you anything you want to know about any of these things.  And Wikipedia feeds into that.  And where are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who are you?  What are you doing now?  Plus add in Google DNS and a Google OS so it really can know us as it goes along.  Are we sheep being led to the slaughter, though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, is this are we willing to Google give?  I mean, when when it does this, it's incredibly compelling, compelling offer.  And no one is going to say no.  Everyone is going to opt in.  And and Google then becomes the arbiter of all information.  They become Skynet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is when you use time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the time we realize there won't be any more yellow pages that we can fall back on.  It's too late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was interesting for me going to Paris because I'm so used to using my phone to tell me where to go now.  And I didn't work there.  I've got a droid.  I could use it for Wi Fi.  I can use it anywhere else.  It was like, oh, right.  There are these things in them called maps that I can look at to find where I get to the destination.  I remember this from the 80s.  You know, it was like a trip back in time for me.  I know just on the walls of the metro, right?  There's a map.  Then you get to the destination.  There's a local map.  You know, it is a system that's been there 100 years that works.  But I'm so used to carrying this thing around.  It's saying turn left here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think there's going to be a nostalgia movement, just as there is with vinyl records of people who want yellow pages and paper maps.  And they're going to be seen as very retro and bizarre.  They're going to wear Edwardian clothes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Secret society of yellow pages.  It's just steampunk, yeah.  Oh, let me pull out my map.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow, that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Should we talk about the Twitter hack this weekend and security a little bit?  Yes, please do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What happened?  This was the Iranian thing?  Yeah, the Iranian thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the Twitter homepage, I think it was Friday night or Thursday night.  I think for an hour.  Was it Thursday night?  For an hour was redirected to, I forget what it's called.  It was called the Iranian cyber hacker squad or something.  That should not happen.  That should not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They should.  What the hell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, after all Twitter has been through, you would think at this point.  But TechCrunch wrote up how it happened.  And basically the attackers had been able to take over the email address that Twitter had registered with their DNS service.  So they went and sent a password reset email and had gotten into the account.  And then it was just a DNS redirect.  So they didn't actually hack into the Twitter servers.  They just said this IP address should go down to our page.  They said we own Twitter.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just out of curiosity, did we know who the domain registrar was that was so blithely said, oh, Twitter's moved to Iran.  I mean, what the hell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the service is called DynDyn.  I hadn't heard of it before.  DynDyns.  DynDyns.  No, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's right.  I think it's just Dyn.  It's the same company.  It's not the same thing.  It's the same company.  Yes, it is.  Because we were talking about some security issues with DynDyns and their parent company runs Twitter's servers.  I forgot about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I mean, it really wasn't their fault because they got into the account because they sent the password.  You know, the Twitter's email address wasn't set up.  No, I know.  They just set up passwords.  So the December reminder to everyone is to double check your secondary email accounts, make sure that your passwords are secure, that your Webmail accounts are all active, that no one can just go set up, reset up that Hotmail account you used and send to Google account password reset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And by the way, Apple is not moving to Vladivostok.  So if you get any email saying Apple is moving, that's not true.  Geez.  You would think there'd be some sanity check, but I guess maybe it's fully automated.  Yeah, it seems that way.  It does seem that way.  That's got to really hurt.  I want to get to our tool tip and number of the week in just a bit before we before we do anything in that direction.  Anybody have another story that you want us to cover before we move on?  Going going.  This is a great conversation, by the way, just fascinating conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The other interesting Twitter one this week was the WordPress and and posters implementing the Twitter API.  I thought that that was interesting.  I was interested to see what Gina thought of that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love that idea because it it disintermediates Twitter.  And this was this was Twitter's Achilles heel, right?  Because they have this great API.  And you can you copyright an API?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So so actually, I missed the story.  So what happened?  So they implemented the API so that you can make requests to the blogging services versus Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can use your Twitter third party tools to post to post or WordPress.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So explain that to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it means that the because the API is published and well known, anybody could say, OK, just this happened with Blogger Kevin, right?  The Blogger API, the Blogger RPC became the de facto way to post to a blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  And, you know, there's a bunch of us be going around saying we should come up with some standards for this stuff for a while.  This is the activity streams thing and all that stuff.  That's going OK.  But Twitter was like, oh, we like what we've done.  And so the others have now said, oh, well, if people are using your API, why don't we just clone it?  So Matt and Co at WordPress did this first.  And the posters guys did it later in the week where you could now use some Twitter clients where you can actually set the end point to read and write to those as well.  By passing Twitter.  That's fantastic.  Isn't that great?  Got it.  So it's it's emulating the Twitter API.  Yeah.  So that's that's interesting.  I'm not sure it's necessarily the best thing because the Twitter API isn't as rich as as all the other APIs.  It would be nice if we had a nice open API that was designed for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's what Dave Weiner was saying this week.  It doesn't happen that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That doesn't happen that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or are emergent and they come out often or standards are emergent and they come out of people's behavior and somebody says, good idea.  I'll do that too.  And boom, you're all there.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Unfortunately, that's to some extent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, you know, there are standards that are designed as well.  Yeah.  But the good ones are based on practice.  The bad ones are made up from scratch by somebody in a, you know, in an ivory tower somewhere, somewhere in Massachusetts.  And the good ones tend to be put together by, oh, we're doing this thing.  Why don't we get together and see if we can agree it?  If you look at our orphan, those those standards, they come through that process.  It's interesting to see.  And it was, you know, I've been as someone who's been poking the Twitter guys about it would be nice if you came to more standards meetings.  This is sort of interesting twist on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They kind of won.  What's what's wrong with the Twitter API?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nothing.  Nothing's wrong for its purpose for Twitter.  It doesn't actually is it's like my analogy is the difference between a T-shirt and a suit.  If the Twitter API is like Facebook API is really well fitted for the purpose there, what you need for a general case is something that's slightly looser fitting that'll that'll map to more places.  So, you know, the Twitter API isn't a perfect fit for a blog, but it's similar enough that you can make it work.  But you'll find that something is something's don't quite make sense in that world because you have to map.  So if I'm retweeting, what does that mean?  With posters, it means I'm reblogging with WordPress.  Not clear what it means.  If I'm if I'm replying, is that a comment on the blog or is that a post to my own blog?  The mapping isn't perfectly exact.  You've got to decide what it means.  But it's close enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But then, Kevin, isn't the sense isn't the old mapping of the blog world what's the suit and limited when you put it that way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, Twitter was a was was a blog service to begin with.  You can argue that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the point is, you know, what you can argue that, but if Twitter is not going to implement that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  Just let it happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If Twitter, you know, if to give an example, Twitter won't do enclosures.  This is Dave Winer's crusade for Twitter.  Give me a way to attach MP3 files to Twitter.  The blogs have ways of doing that.  So how do we do that now?  Well, we would have to work out a mapping that sort of degrades down to something that works for Twitter to post it as a link.  And then we have to reverse the short link and decide it's an MP3 into a whole bunch of extra code to deal with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't that what Twitpick does?  You know, it's a brand and the clients tend to know that it's a photo and displays the photo in the client.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. But it has to.  But it knows it's Twitpick.  It doesn't.  Some of them work with Flickr.  Some of them don't.  Some of them work with Wifrog.  Some of them don't.  For each URL, you actually have to go there and sit there and fetch it and then sniff it and say, was that a JPEG?  Was that a page that contains a JPEG?  How do I know if this is a photo service?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or you know that the URL always has JPEGs.  So Dave Winer tomorrow could start and you, oh, fathers of podcasting, could start a new enclosure brand tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  And then have to go and talk to every client and say, by the way, you know, KevinFansPhoto.com  is a photo service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the beautiful thing about the client world is the client is like a federation because the clients are keeping up on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's a weak way to do it because how many, I mean, you're going to have a hundred of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Compared to putting an image tag in there that says this is an image, it's a fairly clunky way of doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I also can see it's a world where you throw out a feature and if there's critical mass behind it, it will get adoption.  If there isn't, it won't.  Sure.  It's not unlike, you know, the fact that a hashtag became a hashtag only because it gained critical mass.  Yeah.  So I kind of like that emergent sense of it rather than the committee sense of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But technologists hate it because it's so disorderly and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why I like it. I like to make them nervous and give them congestion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're making Kevin very nervous.  I know I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've been advocating for empirical standards, emergent standards.  What we do is we say, okay, clearly six of us are trying to do something that is really similar here.  How about we agree on how to do it rather than doing it in slum?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Eventually you want a standard. You don't want it all ad hoc because it gets crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But then you don't have to sort of do it through business relationships.  You can do it through reading the spec and that's the thing that helps in the end.  Right.  Gina, you've worked with this API.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have and I have a whole block of code that says if this is twitpic.com, do this.  If this is WireFrog, do this.  So I mean, if a leader came out and said, okay, I'm going to publish an XML file and keep it updated of all the mapping,  what photo services do their method calls and then so my client has to query that every time.  That's cool. But I would rather it was just an enclosure standard.  That says this is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't that kind of a meta DNS then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what it would be.  It's just that, you know, and then if someone launched, you know, Kevin launches his photo service,  he has to let the intermediary organization know they have to update and then my client has to.  But then like my client's making all these other and it's complicated.  It's a more complex way to do it than if you just, you know, supported enclosures in a standard.  But that being said, if the Twitter API has been implemented in a wide number of really great clients on a lot of different platforms.  So the fact that you can post to other services using it means that if all the clients make configurable endpoints,  meaning that you can say, hey, when I post a status update, you know, post it to my blog here, post it to Twitter here,  post it to these rest the rest of these places.  It's great for everyone. It's great for developers because you don't have to rewrite code.  It's great for users because you can access many platforms from one single interface.  And it's great for the clients because suddenly they become multi tools and they're not just Twitter tools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, if that happens and if I used the Twitter API to never update Twitter to only update WordPress, which I could do right.  Yeah. Then what control does Twitter still have over the API if everybody agrees to an enclosure and Twitter doesn't do it, but everybody else is doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So if everyone else agrees to enclosures and Twitter doesn't, that means that you that that your client, I mean, could should should be able to do those,  have that extra feature if you're just posting to your blog and not Twitter and Twitter wouldn't.  So no, I mean, Twitter wouldn't, you know, be able to wouldn't have any control over that.  I don't believe that you can trademark method, you know, method calls and interfaces.  I don't think that you can you can take you can copyright an API, although I'm not I'm not positive.  But I'm pretty sure that you could say we support the Twitter API plus all this other stuff as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Could Twitter do anything about that? If they if they I'm not sure that they would necessarily have to dislike it.  But if they did, is there any way they could torpedo it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't I don't believe so. I don't think so.  But I'm not well, there's a real risk there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you change the API out from under stuff like this, there's the real risk that you'll leave behind all the people who are running to the API.  You can't you can't just kind of say, oh, we're going to that's deprecated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you would overload the API versus change it.  Right. Right. So you would all of it should work.  You know, and match and parallel Twitter's.  But you'd overload them for the other services that can do the extra stuff.  And Twitter just couldn't do that. So that's how you'd have to handle it, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if your Twitter go the other way, if Twitter is smart and they are, how do they take advantage of this?  There's no defense. There's no defense.  So do they do they, you know, convene committees to agree to all these other things that even they never thought of?  Is there a way that they can embrace this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, potentially, but they'd have to, you know, basically set up a say.  They've already got a discussion forum for we want new things in our API.  Can you add them so they could make that less of a please up?  Please do this for me, Twitter, you know, the Microsoft approach to APIs and make it more like an open source model where people can submit patches and things.  But they've had that would that change for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, if the most popular Twitter client supports enclosures and lots of people using it to to to post to their blog, I think that's a very compelling reason for Twitter to consider that addition to the API versus, you know, a couple of forum posts when people saying, hey, we'd really like to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But isn't that what's happening already with Twitpick and YFrog and all of these? It's de facto enclosures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They operate differently with it.  I specialize in ignorant questions.  So is there an open source API, their open source code bases?  But is there an open source API like what you just described, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Open social was a good example.  Open social is an API that's designed for a whole bunch of different social networks to do this kind of thing and includes, you know, identity.  It includes activity streams and a few bits and pieces like that.  And the way changes happen to it is people propose them to the standards group.  They debate it and then they issue a new version of the standard with code.  And that's if the IETF is an organization that's built on this model, right, the IETF that does the Internet standards is designed to let you create new standards by reference to old standards.  And you debate them and you create interoperating interoperating implementations and post them to that and extend them over time.  So there is there is history here.  But the difference here could be that Twitter could become that body.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If Twitter embraced this, they would become like the IETF and say, OK, we're going to help everybody do this in a more sane way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They could do that over everybody else's dead body.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  I mean, the IETF is, yeah, I mean, it's yeah.  A standards committee is by definition not a single corporate interest, right?  I mean, it wouldn't be.  Yeah.  It wouldn't be the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that's what the Open Web Foundation was set up to try and make it easy for people to do this kind of thing.  What we've seen over the last couple of years is that the new standards end up having to set up some governing body that you can agree to changes to it and deal with.  And the point of the Open Web Foundation was to provide a template so people could do that.  So that would be one answer.  OK, is the Open Web Foundation template would administer this?  But it still it still comes out of having the will to say, yes, we're handing over control of this to a third party.  We're not going to make it ourselves.  That's that's that's a difficult thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm delaying my own pizza.  But one more question.  You are.  You're delaying my pizza now.  Go ahead.  Sorry.  So the fact that two things happened this week.  Google announced its own URL shortening service.  Meanwhile, Bitly came out with a pro version and also some neat stuff like Bitly video where they can tear apart the URLs and find out what's most popular videos are.  So does the shortening service become kind of a parallel API to all this?  And you find different features with different shortening services.  And what happens if people use Google's versus Bitly's or the New York Times's or Bitly's private labeled ones?  Does that complicate our world again, too?  Or am I just being dumb?  No, it does complicate things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Because like because some photo services, for example, I think like tweet photo lets you do things that maybe why frog doesn't let you do like comment or star or have friends.  And and so Bitly offers statistics on clicks that maybe other shortening services don't.  Right.  So so and that's part of the reason why some people like to use some of the other over the others.  I like Bitly because it gives me stats.  I'm not even really sure if Google's new shortening services service does that.  So so no, it complicates things right.  Because then it becomes is is the stats and the extra stuff that you can do with the shortening or with the enclosure.  Is that part of the API as well?  I mean, is it in order to be a shortener or an image host for Twitter?  Do you have to support?  You know, should you support these extra things?  It's you know, it's a good question.  Everyone's kind of overloading things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you sign up for pro?  The Bitly pro.  Did you sign up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have not.  I have not yet, but I very well may.  Yeah, a lot of people try that.  Is it fantastic?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why I'm asking you.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It lets you do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It becomes a private label service, right?  You have, you know, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not sure what you make.  You make it.  Yeah.  So I can have.  It slash whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I tried to get to that IT, but you have to be Italian, unfortunately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ah, that's the other thing I wonder, by the way, all these two tin horn dictators that own these suffixes.  If one of them pulled out, if I don't know what dot L Y is Libya, don't you love Libya?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, Gaddafi.  Hello, Gaddafi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We've just, you know, put our necks on the line with Libya.  Yeah.  And they could pull out and they could hold us up now and say, all that data you have is now useless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's an interesting point.  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That happened to Twitter by Fiat because of the government.  Yeah, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We owned that in L.I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Every bit of the URL to Gaddafi fan page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that would be dastardly.  Dastardly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not that I want to give anybody any ideas.  Sorry.  Once again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Come back.  When Tuvalu sinks, what are we going to do?  There'll be no dot TV.  Then I'm in trouble.  We're going to take a break.  Come back in just a bit with your tip of the week.  Gina Trapani, your number of the week, Jeff Jarvis, and I have a tool of the week.  And we'll just let you say anything you want, Kevin Marks.  Anything at all.  I have to think of something.  Think of something clever to say.  It could be, what about your epigram of the week?  I think that's what Kevin should have an epigram of the week.  Epigram of the week.  Wow.  You have a minute.  I have a minute to think about that one.  Start spinning.  But first I want to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, about my life.  Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, about my great Ford SYNC.  I think this is absolutely a transformational technology in cars.  And in fact, I understand some major announcements coming from Ford at CES.  We'll be there and we will cover it.  Ford SYNC is the hands-free Bluetooth phone capability in all Ford, Lincoln and new Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles.  But it's more than that because it's also a way that you control your media player.  When my iPhone is connected, it starts playing back audio from the Bluetooth.  I can listen to music.  If I connect it up via USB, because every Ford SYNC vehicle has a USB port, you can then index all the stuff on your Ford SYNC.  And you can say, play this week in Google episode 21.  And it starts playing.  You can say, play The Beatles.  You can play Next.  Play Previous.  Play Similar.  I mean, it is just incredible.  And I have a feeling that we're going to see some very interesting developments.  I think Ford SYNC is the iPhone of car computers.  I want you to try it.  You can do a couple of things.  Go to syncmyridepodcast.com for a tour of what Ford SYNC can do to learn more about it.  Or just go to your local Ford, Lincoln and Mercury dealer.  You don't have to say, I want to drive the car.  Say, I'd like to test drive the SYNC.  See what they say.  Ford SYNC.  It is incredible.  And if you're in the market for a new auto, I highly encourage you to take a look at Ford, Lincoln or Mercury vehicles just for the SYNC alone.  Syncmyridepodcast.com is the URL.  It's time for your tip of the week, my dear.  I sound like WC Field.  So, my dear, it's your tip of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this week, Google launched a useful little addition to your Gmail contacts list, which is your contacts for your entire Google account.  If you go into your contacts, you can.  There's now a new button that says find duplicates.  Hallelujah.  It will do just that.  It will show you names that appear twice.  So, you know, if you have a friend who emails you from one address and then emails you from another address later, that person appears twice in your contacts.  But you hit that find duplicates button.  It will show you a list of the names that appear to be dupes.  And then you can in one shot, you can check off the ones that are indeed dupes and hit a merge button.  And it'll just, it'll just merge them all together and clean up your contacts list in one shot.  Much needed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does it do a good job?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It does a great job.  Yeah, that's great.  It shrunk my contacts list by like 50 people who I had doubles of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hallelujah.  Well, you get doubles also because of Gmail copying addresses of people you send mail to and not knowing that it's in that contact.  And so you get all these extra little, I look forward to that.  That's great.  I will try it immediately.  Jeff Jarvis.  Really glad to ship that.  Pardon me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Really glad to ship that.  Remember, they were building that when I was there.  So that's been coming for a while.  So that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  So now that you have synchronization, you've got to have deduplification.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that a word?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It made sense to us, but no one.  In my world, it definitely is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think there's a F in there.  But anyway, deduplification sounds right somehow.  Jeff Jarvis, what's your number of the week?  Two billion.  Two billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've been crowing about how Google News does one billion clicks a month and Bitly had matched that.  Well, now Bitly has doubled that.  And the Bitly blog says that they're now at two billion clicks a month.  That's a lump caused, which is awe-inspiring and amazing.  But it also, I think, does raise the concern that we've spoken about a minute ago, is that we've lost the transparency of addresses on the web.  And so it's very hard for us to gather around addresses and find the heat.  And there are intermediaries who now we have to go to to decode addresses again.  It becomes, as we said a minute ago in another context, a kind of shadow meta DNS.  And in a way, that's troubling, I think, that we've made addresses opaque again.  Nonetheless, give credit to Bitly.  And also note, I think, the importance of this, that if you add up Bitly plus all its competitors, you have the growth of the human link and the power of the human link again versus just the search and the algorithmic means of discovery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Amazing.  Bitly, I think, is an amazing service.  I have to say, I'm really looking forward to trying these things.  And I don't care what more.  I'm our Gaddafi once.  Now, this actually ties very well into I'm going to do two tools because one, of course, is the one Gina mentioned, these Google shortening, GOO.GL.  And I don't know who runs Greenland, but we can hope that they will be a benign superpower protecting us with our shortened links via Google.  Now, it doesn't seem like it has a whole lot of features.  There's no Bitly, let's put it that way.  But I wouldn't put the guys in Mountain View out of the picture.  I'm sure at some point it will have a lot of features.  And certainly there's a pretty clear roadmap of where you go with a URL shortening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, let's start the rumor right now that Google is going to buy Bitly.  It's not true.  I know nothing.  But what the heck?  Let's make a rumor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's how Mike works.  That's fine.  Oh, GOO.GL.  And there is a Chrome extension if you want to do it automatically in there.  I really don't know why anybody would, to be honest, would use this as opposed to Bitly.  But there's a reason.  There's certainly a reason why Google is doing it.  And they say the core goals of the service are stability, security, and speed.  And I think I'd have to add a fourth, Greenland.  Also, this is the tool I was going to start with.  It's Google browser size.  This is kind of an oddball tool.  But you can...  But it's bizarre.  But it's bizarre.  You can see how much of your page, as a web designer, people can see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that's such a stupid tool.  Can I run about this for a minute?  Yes, please.  It's like, first of all, if my screen's only that wide, the layout changes because I've done my page properly.  Secondly, my little screen is zooming in and out now.  And thirdly, guess what?  People scroll.  This whole above-the-fold crap...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's kind of antiquated, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  ...for 10 years.  And people actually scroll down and look at stuff.  I just think it looks cool.  Let me be honest with you.  It looks cool, but it's propagating the wrong thing.  It's one of those...  The top of the bank corner matters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's one of those great informatics that makes you really think you're learning something when in fact you're learning nothing at all.  People don't read the top inch, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  People don't read the top inch because they expect a banner ad to be there.  They put stuff in that top inch, nobody sees it because they look down an inch below it.  So there's a whole science of eye-tracking here.  There's a whole set of actually observing people's behavior and what they do.  And this is doing this in the crudest, stupidest way possible.  I expect better from Google, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you guys see thereisnopagefold.com, which I think launched on the same day?  I love it.  Matt Hawley said that he loved the irony.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is no page fold.  This is the internet.  Plus, I think the whole notion of homepages goes away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The notion of homepages is silly.  That's where you package the world and most traffic doesn't come in through the homepage.  And so I say there should be no homepages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Welcome to the World Wide Web, an interactive medium in which screen resolution statistics are trivial, browser view reports are variable, and scrolling behavior is a standard.  Keep going.  Go down, go down, go down, go down, go down.  There is no page fold.  There's more.  Keep going.  Keep going.  Go all the way to the bottom.  You can tell because you get a little scrolling.  Love your scroll bar.  Okay, so my tool sucked, but it did give us a great conversation.  And that's all I really care about.  It's been really good having you all on.  Kevin Marks, thanks for joining us.  It's always a pleasure.  Nice to be back.  Of course, Kevin's blog is apeyas.blogspot.com.  But is there anywhere else you'd like to plug, anything else you'd like to let us know about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I think you could look at Ribbit Mobile.  I think that's interesting.  Ribbit, yeah.  Go sign up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  R-I-B-B-I-T Mobile from the Service of British Telecom.  And is it just for Wave or is it for anybody?  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is a service.  It transcribes it well and sends it to you as an SMS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, and I hope that whatever he said will come to me as an SMS soon.  That's some clever stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ribbit, R-I-B-B-I-T.com.  Thank you, Kevin.  It's great to talk to you.  Mr. Jeff Jarvis is always available at buzzmachine.com.  His great blog, which is a must read, is one of the best bloggers out there.  I really enjoy it.  And don't forget the book, What Would Google Do?  Edition 29 or whatever it is.  How many editions?  We have 11 printings.  11 printings.  Amazing.  Gina Trapani's blog is SmarterWear.org.  She's also the author of The Complete Guide to Google Wave at CompleteWaveGuide.com.  And she's in the snowstorm now.  Yes, sir.  She will never come back to San Diego again.  She's buried in avalanche.  At least not until next year.  You and Jeff stay warm and enjoy your holidays.  We will be back here on Boxing Day if you guys wish to continue to do a show.  The day after Christmas, you up for it?  I'm up for it.
