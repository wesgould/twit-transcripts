[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.480]   To the twisted world of journalism.
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.240]   Hello Jeff.
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.240]   Happy holidays.
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.240]   Same back.
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.440]   You have a pleasure at work.
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.440]   I am still.
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.440]   I have meetings all day today.
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.920]   The kids are almost a jam, everything.
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.960]   Oh my God, if we don't do it by the end of the year, it'll be next year.
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.960]   Next week.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:53.960]   But the kids have gone.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:54.960]   They're gone.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:55.960]   Yeah.
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:56.960]   You had a graduation.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:57.960]   I wore my...
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:58.960]   Your gown?
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:59.960]   Love tea.
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:00.960]   Yeah.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:01.960]   Yeah.
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:02.960]   Do you...
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:03.960]   Now I remember when...
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.760]   Because my dad was a professor at commencement, you'd wear the gown of the college from which
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.960]   you graduated or got your graduate degree.
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.600]   Yes, but don't forget, I only have a bachelor's, so I don't have any hash for it.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.600]   You have no gown.
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.600]   I have a gown.
[00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.600]   I have a cheap gown.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.600]   It's a nylon thing that they rent.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.040]   Yeah, dad had Columbia from a PhD Columbia.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.120]   He had a blue velvet and stripes and it wasn't a mortar board.
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.120]   It was like a...
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:29.120]   A thing.
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.120]   Yeah.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.120]   Oh yeah, that was a great thing.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.120]   A bonnet.
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.120]   I get jealous of those.
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.880]   It's not worth it to go get a degree just to get the dress.
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.840]   That's a long way to go, just for the dress.
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.920]   Anyway, welcome and it's good to see you.
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.520]   We should mention once again Gina Trippani's taking the month of December off to relocate.
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.520]   We miss her.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.600]   Yay, she'll be in New York.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.200]   Baratunde just got his Brooklyn apartment.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.200]   Oh wow.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.200]   There's a massive tilt to the east.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.120]   Yeah, you think Silicon Valley's all hip is not.
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.120]   Brooklyn is the...
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.640]   Oh god yeah.
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.200]   I interviewed Alexis O'Haney on triangulation on Wednesday and you found her read it.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.920]   And of course, probably the King hipster.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.480]   And people were coming over.
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.080]   They had people in the house.
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.840]   He actually gone into the bathroom to do the interview so that the people in the house,
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.160]   because they were all going to dinner afterwards, probably some, you know, polenta crust pizza
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.160]   parlor.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.160]   I hate you.
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.720]   Oh, you make fun.
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.720]   You make fun of you.
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.720]   I'm just jealous.
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:24.720]   Hey, look who else is here.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.720]   We got Kevin Marks.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.520]   He is visiting us under his umbrella out in his garden as usual.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.520]   Hello there.
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.720]   Nice to see you all.
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.000]   I'm going to resist the temptation to say the out of works Kevin Marks.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.880]   I will say the consulting engineer Kevin Marks.
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:40.880]   There we go.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.520]   The CEO of Google, Apple, Salesforce, British Telecom.
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.200]   This guy has left more jobs.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.200]   Which one?
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.200]   BBC.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.200]   That's right.
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.200]   He started at the beeb.
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.200]   Yep.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.200]   That's where he gets up.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.720]   He's on a good accent.
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.840]   And also with us Mike Elgin, who was soon to take the helm as news director here at...
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.040]   Oh, he's wearing Google glass glass.
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.040]   Yep.
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:05.040]   He brought me...
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.280]   You brought me burgundy of Twiff.
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.280]   Exactly.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.280]   Stay classy.
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.280]   Jeff Jarvis.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.280]   Growinger mustache now.
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.280]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.640]   Set up on head detection.
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.400]   Enable this feature to consume less power when you're not wearing glass.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.480]   This is your son's glass.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.480]   When is anybody not going to be wearing glass?
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.040]   You can wear it 24/7.
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.040]   This is the one that's...
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.760]   This is a 2.0, right?
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.760]   That's right.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.920]   And supposedly I can wink, take off glass, put it back on and tap touchpad.
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.680]   And then they have a lovely lady doing it.
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.680]   And it is it.
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.680]   Okay.
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.960]   Done.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.600]   You just did something.
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.600]   You heard the little click, right?
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.600]   Something happened.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.600]   Now I just see the Google logo.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.600]   Is it rebooting?
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.600]   No, that's just to program the Google logo into your brain.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.600]   That's what that means to us.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.600]   Burned me in the eye-ris.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.600]   Do you have glass, Kevin?
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.600]   You're the only one here who...
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.600]   No.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.600]   It's not a glass hole.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.600]   I wear glasses all the time, so it was practical.
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.600]   No.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.600]   They will be now, though.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.600]   You can add prescription lenses to this.
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.000]   Glass hole is now a term of endearment.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.400]   And so now we use glass wipe.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.400]   Glass wipe.
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.200]   Stay glassy, Petaluma.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:15.600]   I'll be sending my back in January, first week of January.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.600]   I get my exchange.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.600]   Ah, good.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.960]   So you already got your 2.0s.
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.400]   This is my son's.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.400]   He got it later.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.360]   So he got his first start of 2.0.
[00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:25.800]   And I have 2.0 on the way.
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.800]   This is the old one.
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.800]   That's the new one.
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.800]   They look identical.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.360]   But the 2.0 has faster speeds and additional capabilities.
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.440]   Have you found it to be fragile at all?
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.440]   I actually broke my first pair.
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.080]   Put it in my backpack in the case that they give you.
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.560]   And I bent it in half.
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.240]   And it's happened to a lot of people.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.880]   They just replaced it, no questions.
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.040]   Scobles like on his third.
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.320]   Well, I think there's a little margin.
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.880]   Well, he showers with the thing, so.
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:50.880]   Yeah.
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.280]   Yeah, they should have refused Scoble on that basis.
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.400]   So one of the things, and this is, I think, a little controversial, that they have now
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.520]   enabled is blink to snap a picture.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:05.160]   So in the past with glass, you had to touch the temple and then say, "Okay, glass.
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.400]   Take a picture."
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.400]   So it was.
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.400]   Or bring your head up and down and say, "Okay, glass."
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.400]   Yeah.
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.400]   Oh, you could do that, right?
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.400]   And that was way too.
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:12.400]   That was way too inconvenient.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.320]   Well, it was a warning to those abouts that you were about to take a picture of them.
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.880]   Now you just wink and it takes a picture.
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.320]   Well, no, you always had the ability just to hit the little switch there.
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.320]   Yeah.
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.320]   And take a picture.
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.320]   Just the most subtle way.
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:27.320]   Or voice.
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.320]   Oh, so you could do this until it would take a picture?
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.680]   No, there's a little button right there on the top.
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:32.840]   On the top right there.
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:33.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:34.840]   That's it.
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.120]   Even that's more obvious than just blinking.
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.120]   And blinking also has a little bit of...
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.160]   Yeah, winking is a little creepy.
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.120]   Yeah, if you're taking pictures of strangers, winking doesn't help.
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.040]   And if you get a piece of dust in your eye, as Dr. Mom says, you could end up taking a
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.040]   lot of pictures.
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.040]   You don't know.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.040]   I don't know.
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.440]   I think that this...
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.440]   I'm surprised.
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.240]   I remember it was a hack in the first class.
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.720]   I'm surprised Google actually enables this.
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.720]   Well, it's a...
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.200]   I think it's a speed thing.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:06.480]   They've really tried hard to make it really fast to take a picture because that's really
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.480]   the only benefit.
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:11.240]   If you have to take out your phone and take a picture, that takes a while.
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.240]   But if you suddenly there's something crazy happening right in front of you, you can
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.640]   just wink and you've got the picture.
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.520]   Even if it's off, it'll work.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.680]   It's actually kind of amazing.
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:25.560]   It's just a little creepy to take pictures of strangers because they think you're the
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.120]   one who is stranger.
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.120]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:29.520]   They're winking at people.
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.520]   Microsoft...
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:36.400]   Sorry, Google is very focused on photography, the additions to Google+, and now people are
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:41.080]   putting snow in their pictures by shaking their phone.
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.080]   That's their holiday.
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.080]   I've had enough of that.
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:44.080]   Yeah.
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.800]   I'm a big fan of the photo stuff, but the twinkling and the snowing, they're just...
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.680]   So you take an existing picture that's on your phone and all you do is you shake it and
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.640]   then it will generate snow like this.
[00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.640]   You can share that.
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:08:00.080]   And then yeah, it doesn't automatically share it, but if you save it, then you have a copy
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.080]   just like that.
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.080]   The other thing...
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.200]   It might be that it's one on mine, but except you'd manage to turn it upside down while
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:08.200]   it was doing it, so it's smooth for the ground options.
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.080]   You thought that's worth something.
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.880]   That's an error at the printing plant.
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.560]   Is this like a misprinted stamp?
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.560]   Is this a...
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.080]   I've got a collectable Google+, for that.
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.560]   I think so.
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.920]   But I guess it shows their capability.
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:22.920]   I don't know what it shows.
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:24.720]   They seem obsessed with snow globes.
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:29.840]   They had the temporary mall demo thing with the snow globes.
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:30.840]   You go inside the snow globes.
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:31.840]   Oh yeah, yeah.
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.080]   It's just snow globes.
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.080]   That's right.
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.480]   Anyway, it's a strange upset.
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.480]   Jeff?
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:42.400]   Just saying that one more glass story that just came out was that I think in a week or
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:47.360]   so, an independent facial recognition app was coming.
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:49.880]   Oh, well Google block it, right?
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:50.880]   They have to approve it, right?
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.880]   It doesn't just appear.
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:53.880]   Yeah.
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:54.880]   Unless you...
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:55.880]   Can you sideload unglass?
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:56.880]   You can't...
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.080]   Well, I mean, it won't be listed among the normal apps that are generally given...
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.080]   But it can be out there.
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.320]   They're kind of our rated apps and things like that.
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.800]   They don't approve that people can still...
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.560]   The world's tiniest porn.
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:07.560]   Yeah.
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.560]   Like I'd want to...
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:09.560]   That's ridiculous.
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:10.560]   I think that's a breast.
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:14.560]   I don't know what this is, but it's flesh color, and I like it.
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.560]   So they're gonna...
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.560]   See, that's the...
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:17.560]   See, this is...
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:20.240]   Okay, so there's two issues of privacy.
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.120]   One is that you're surrepticulously taking pictures.
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:26.480]   That's why I'm surprised that they approved the winking, but the other is this facial recognition,
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.560]   which I think is very, very valuable.
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.560]   Yeah, I think that's great.
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:36.240]   But Google has declined to do it, even though they can, because of the issue of stalkers,
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.240]   right?
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:40.000]   No, it's just because they think it sounded creepy.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.480]   This was a directly a Schmidt thing, wasn't it?
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.480]   Cross is the creepy line.
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:49.120]   Because they built this years ago with Google Goggles.
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:53.920]   There was a version of that that would identify people that they tested and then said, "No,
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.080]   we don't want to do that.
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.080]   That's too creepy."
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.080]   Right.
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.080]   Let's be honest.
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.800]   Either find Google's not gonna do it.
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:00.880]   They're gonna wait for others to do it.
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:01.960]   It's gonna become popular.
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:02.960]   It's gonna work.
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:03.960]   You can't stop it.
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:04.960]   It's just knowledge.
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.200]   Knowledge is not dangerous.
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.600]   Being creepy is what's creepy.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.600]   Right.
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.600]   Yep.
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.000]   The other thing is that it's just a convenience.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.200]   You can already take a picture surreptitiously.
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.280]   Upload it to Google+, and Google+, will tell you who it is.
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.480]   So why not...
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.080]   Why wait?
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:23.080]   And as I've pointed out, I'm pointing out with back in the Goggles days, the government
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:24.080]   already does it?
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.080]   So shouldn't we?
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.080]   Yeah.
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.080]   Shouldn't we be able to?
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.080]   I'm not sure.
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.960]   One of my students, I think I told you a year ago, is trying to use class with people without
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:32.960]   timers.
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:36.480]   There'll be therapeutic uses of it that are valuable for people.
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:40.040]   Well, for all of us above a certain age, Jeff...
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.040]   Well yes.
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.760]   I'm Kaleo.
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.440]   I don't remember people's names.
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.680]   Oh god, no.
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.800]   I get introduced to people in five minutes later who they are.
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:53.040]   So having glass would be great.
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.720]   Face recognition glass anyway.
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:58.200]   There's also the problem of Phantom Glass Syndrome, which I've suffered from.
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:02.080]   I've actually looked up to get information and there was nothing there.
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.600]   I've also touched the side of my head and there was just nothing.
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.600]   Phantom Glass Syndrome.
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.760]   Or my Gell-Ginnam.
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:14.840]   He was a normal man until he got struck with Phantom Glass Syndrome.
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:18.320]   Google apparently is moving ahead with its photographic stuff.
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:25.360]   They just hired Blaze Aguirá Iárquez, who is the guy who did photosynthes for Microsoft,
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:29.840]   which is an amazing, wonderful technology.
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:34.360]   I think that was one that Robert Scobel said he was in tears when he saw.
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:39.880]   I may be wrong, but if he wasn't crying, he should have been.
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.680]   Photosynthes is really, really beautiful.
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:46.360]   He just helped Microsoft with the newest version of Photosynthes, which ironically appeared
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:49.840]   on iOS first, not on Microsoft's Windows phones.
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:55.680]   He's going to work on machine learning at Google according to the New York Times who,
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:59.720]   quote, "people with knowledge of his plans who has to remain anonymous because news of
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.760]   his hiring had not been publicly announced."
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:07.320]   Mr. Aguirá Iárquez has confirmed that he has left Microsoft to join Google but wouldn't
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.760]   say what he was going to do.
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.520]   Microsoft says we wish him well in his future endeavors.
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.880]   He's an amazing engineer because he's been involved.
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:20.000]   Well, he's been involved in a very wide variety of projects, including augmented reality, wearable
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   computing.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.520]   He was deeply involved in Bing, development of Bing.
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:32.240]   These are disparate, unrelated areas, and he's been involved in all of them.
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.240]   Which that makes sense.
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.680]   He is kind of an AI guy then.
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.680]   He's kind of a machine intelligence guy.
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:38.680]   Right.
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.560]   Who knows what he's going to do at Google, but it's a big blow to Microsoft.
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.520]   You know, this is the problem with Microsoft.
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:46.320]   They have such good research.
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.720]   They develop so much good technology.
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:49.720]   And then where is it?
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.120]   It reminds me of another company.
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:55.280]   It began with an X Xerox, I think was the name of it.
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.280]   Same thing, right?
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:13:02.560]   In fact, somebody once wrote a book on how Xerox invented the world and then lost it,
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.520]   never made it happen.
[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:10.440]   The difference is, Microsoft is a company that rightly or wrongly, for various reasons,
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:11.720]   some people don't trust as much.
[00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:12.720]   It became more the Borg.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.160]   Xerox was never a Borg company.
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.720]   It was just kind of, yeah, didn't go on and do its own stuff.
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:22.480]   I think some things that Microsoft tried to develop didn't develop because it was Microsoft.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.480]   Right.
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:24.480]   Yeah.
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:29.120]   Photosynthesis really need technology, but it doesn't really fit the Windows Office Nexus.
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.120]   Yeah.
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:33.920]   And some of the content things they've done and when they try to do their version of the
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:35.720]   wallet, way, way, way back when.
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:38.040]   And people just didn't want to do it with Microsoft.
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:43.600]   Microsoft had a certain, it was limited itself to what it was envisioned to be.
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:49.040]   But I've seen things in Microsoft research that are the kinds of things that are becoming
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.040]   just now coming online.
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.880]   And I saw them a decade ago at Microsoft.
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:52.880]   Right.
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:53.880]   Things like voice recognition.
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:54.880]   Right.
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:14:00.000]   And they made a big point to say that all of these things were using off the shelf laptops
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.520]   and computers, nothing fancy.
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.760]   And this is old stuff by today's standards.
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.000]   And they were doing amazing things.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.960]   They had this voice recognition thing that could give you a computer voice in any celebrity's
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:10.960]   voice.
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:11.960]   They had JFK, Marilyn Monroe.
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:14.680]   This was like 12 years ago.
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:17.360]   And you never even heard about it outside of their own.
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.680]   Maybe the computer voice sounded like Marilyn Monroe.
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:20.680]   Yes.
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:21.680]   Yes.
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:22.680]   Almost indistinguishable.
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:23.680]   That's kind of intriguing.
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:24.680]   It was fascinating.
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:25.680]   Yeah.
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.480]   It would also learn your voice and would speak in your voice.
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.480]   What?
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:29.480]   Yeah.
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.480]   And they were doing this kind of stuff.
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:34.440]   They also had this fascinating project they were working on which was 3D Avatar Chat
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.320]   where they had two cameras, kind of like connect actually.
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.320]   On you.
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.680]   And it would 3D map your face.
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:40.680]   Wow.
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:42.920]   And then you would chat with people by looking at the Avatar.
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:46.320]   They found that the reason people don't like video conferencing is that they can't make
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.320]   eye contact.
[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:50.040]   One person's looking over here and the other person's looking over there.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:55.280]   But with an Avatar, everybody, each person can look at the make eye contact with the computer
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:57.520]   generated Avatar.
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:02.200]   Fascinating technology using off the shelf parts and nothing fancy and it went nowhere.
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.200]   Is that where Google, is that the difference with Google?
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:07.440]   It seems like it's R&D almost always ends up in a product of some kind.
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.920]   Even if it's a moon shot like a self-referencing.
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.680]   Even if they kill it later, they play with it.
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:13.680]   It's part of the openness.
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:16.040]   They open it up to the public and say, "What do you think of this?"
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.040]   We're not sure.
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:21.240]   Speaking of which, have you met Google's newest employee?
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:22.840]   They call him Big Dog.
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:28.080]   Yes, he's a little noisy.
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:29.080]   But it's...
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.080]   But it...
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.080]   Imagine seeing this coming at you through the woods.
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:35.320]   It's boss of Dynamics, the robotics company, making these robots for the US Department
[00:15:35.320 --> 00:15:40.880]   of Defense just acquired the eighth robotics company purchased by Google, presumably for
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:43.960]   whatever robotics project Andy Rubin is working on.
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:47.200]   Although Andy said, "I'm working on business to business."
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:50.720]   I don't know what business this is.
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:51.720]   The courier service.
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.720]   Well, you know what it could be.
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.720]   I'm not sure you want Google War weekly.
[00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:56.720]   It's going to try to kick it over.
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:57.720]   That is uncanny.
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.400]   That looks like there's a man in there.
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:00.400]   Yeah.
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:01.400]   It's creepy.
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.400]   Yeah.
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:07.120]   Boss of Dynamics specialized in robots that locomote using human-like or animal-like capabilities.
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:11.760]   This is a four-legged creature that can walk over uneven terrain and keep its balance.
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:14.360]   I mean, that guy kicked it and it did not fall over.
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.760]   And it really looks like a human.
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:16.960]   It would look better than I can.
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:17.960]   I'll tell you that.
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:18.960]   Yeah.
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:22.720]   Well, it was not smart enough to get off the snow and into the road.
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:26.400]   Go to the road, Big Dog.
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:27.640]   So Andy Rubin is...
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.240]   Obviously, he's got a big checkbook.
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:32.160]   They're giving him their question by anything he wants.
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.160]   Unbelievable.
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.960]   This to me is a little creepy.
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.360]   But here's what I fear about this.
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:39.080]   So it's not very far.
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:43.560]   This thing is, because it's done for DOD, this thing carries guns and weapons and it becomes
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:45.960]   the bland, the lumber drone.
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:50.360]   They want to use it instead of mules, although, as Mike pointed out on Sunday, a mule is a
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:51.360]   lot cheaper.
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.360]   It was lovely.
[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:54.280]   It does exactly the same thing.
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:59.280]   So the government should Google really be doing, especially right now, the bidding of
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.800]   the government for these kinds of secret projects.
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:07.320]   Well, Google said that they are going to honor the existing contracts, but except no additional
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:09.080]   future contract they did.
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:13.480]   So this is actually one of the most interesting aspects of this story.
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:18.400]   The Pentagon now needs to go find a robotic donkey supplier because these guys are out
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.400]   of it.
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.400]   Out of the robotic donkey.
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.400]   Mike, I just know that that's very interesting.
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:25.080]   And yet they are still doing government work.
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:27.320]   We don't know for how long.
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:30.600]   So a big dog can handle 225 pound payload.
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:31.600]   It can dance.
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:32.800]   It can dance.
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:41.280]   Actually, Cheetah, this is another one of them, it can run faster than Usain Bolt.
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:42.560]   Look at this.
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:46.120]   I mean, I don't know what if this is a package.
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:47.280]   It's pretty impressive.
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:55.720]   Well, my feeling is that this, the founder of Boss & Dynamics has always specialized,
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:18:01.720]   I think his name is Mark Raybert in duplicating animal locomotion.
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.040]   And the reason for that is it's more efficient.
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:06.560]   Nature has already come up with the best forms of locomotion.
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:07.560]   Is that true?
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:10.720]   Because sometimes I feel like nature came up with like the least clue.
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:11.720]   Clueges.
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:14.720]   Yeah, the least unacceptable clue, which as opposed to the most efficient means.
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:15.720]   I feel like a clue.
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:16.720]   Many days.
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:17.720]   No.
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:18.720]   Look at this.
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:21.360]   This is the big dog, the Cheetah running.
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.600]   It could go to the gym for you.
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:27.080]   Think about that and just send this thing to the gym and work out for you.
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:29.280]   But notice that there's a massive tether.
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:33.200]   I mean, a big dog was gas-powered.
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.640]   That's why it was so noisy.
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.440]   But yeah, I don't know.
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:43.360]   Yeah, and of course Google purchased eight robotics companies in the last six months.
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:44.360]   Right.
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:45.360]   Busy busy.
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:50.000]   There's one company that specializes in robotic hands.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.040]   There's robotic eyes, these kinds of things.
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:54.360]   So they're body parts.
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:58.520]   I don't think they've purchased, to the best of my knowledge, any companies that specialize
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:03.000]   in robotics, computer, machine intelligence.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.520]   I guess Google will do that part.
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:09.960]   This is a walking man, a pet man, who was able to walk over sprint ads in a single
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:10.960]   bounce.
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.800]   You can't look at that without thinking of Skynet.
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:13.800]   It's very...
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:15.800]   It's very terminator-like.
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:16.800]   I mean, you know...
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:20.920]   Or come with me if you want to save your life.
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:22.080]   If you want to live.
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.080]   What?
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.920]   That would be a good celebrity voice.
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.320]   Microsoft should collaborate.
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:27.320]   Yeah.
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:28.320]   Wow.
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:30.720]   It's pretty spooky.
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:31.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:32.720]   It's a bit bad about Starkalatska.
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:33.720]   What was that series?
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:34.720]   Oh, yes.
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:35.720]   Silence, yeah.
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:38.320]   Caprica, where they've had the guy making these in the lab.
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.320]   Right.
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:41.160]   Okay, Kevin, you win the Northern War of the day.
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.400]   Yes, Caprica.
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:43.400]   No, should we be...
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:45.160]   I mean, but that's the problem with science fiction.
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.360]   It's just fiction.
[00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:53.880]   So you can't let that stop you because, you know, Frankenstein.
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.880]   Somebody in the chat, Castle Bravo says in the chat, "The future is both interesting
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:57.880]   and scary."
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:58.880]   Yeah.
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:19:59.880]   Did the same time.
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:00.880]   Yeah.
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:01.880]   Yep.
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:03.400]   Well, I just wrote a column about this concept.
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.360]   What is it that's scary about this kind of technology?
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.280]   What is it that's creepy?
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:13.440]   And I have come to believe that it's the combination of the fear of the unknown combined with a
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:16.200]   fear of being out of control.
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:20.000]   So people don't know what these things are going to be capable of and they have a strong
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:23.760]   feeling that they won't have any control over it coming into our lives.
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.480]   And that creeps us out.
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:26.480]   That's...
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:29.160]   Well, I've told the story many, many times in the show, but that's the case with many
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:32.680]   technologies starting, you know, the Kodak camera, the BRIC, the press.
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:36.400]   Yeah, but the Kodak camera couldn't run 28.3 miles an hour.
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.920]   But it could take your picture and steal your soul.
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:39.920]   Yeah.
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:43.040]   I feel like it's also uncanny valley.
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.040]   Yeah.
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.040]   That was about to say that.
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:46.040]   Yeah.
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:47.040]   Yeah.
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.040]   Where you don't want to make...
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:51.880]   It's very hard to do animations that look just like humans because they're just off enough
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.720]   that the human brain goes, "Ooh, that's something wrong with that."
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:55.720]   Yeah.
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:56.720]   And we're programmed for disgust.
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:01.200]   In fact, one of our regular listeners does research in disgust.
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.120]   I think he's at Cornell.
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:09.600]   And disgust is a very valuable evolutionary trait because it keeps you from eating rotten
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.160]   food.
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:14.240]   And we also have disgust at malformed creatures.
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.240]   Yeah.
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.960]   And, you know, those are potentially dangerous situations.
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:17.960]   So I think it's partly that.
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:22.520]   But having the opposite too, Leon, where there's a wonderful researcher at MIT with wonderfully
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:28.800]   named Kate Darlene, who does cute little robot things to make you cuddle with, right?
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:29.800]   Yeah.
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.320]   It's the cybercat.
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:34.040]   And then she tries to get people to destroy it.
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:35.040]   And they can't.
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:36.720]   They can't, right?
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:39.320]   Logically, it's just a machine.
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:42.920]   I can, you know, I can destroy this computer.
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:44.280]   Well, no, yeah, I'll destroy the Mac.
[00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:45.440]   I won't destroy my...
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:48.440]   So Boston Dynamics blew it.
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.600]   They should have made Big Dog look like an e-walk.
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:55.400]   Well, it's an interesting fact that Mark Raybert, who founded this company in 1992, was actually
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.400]   a consultant.
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.200]   He was a consultant on the Sony IBO.
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.200]   Remember that?
[00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.200]   IBO.
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.200]   That was a cute and cuddle robot.
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:07.840]   So apparently the pet man can actually do the John DeVolta impression.
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:10.480]   Just exactly the right kids.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:11.480]   Right.
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.960]   I can do it.
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:19.720]   It's also scary because it looks like, okay, here's what's the most scary thing you can
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:20.720]   think of.
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.520]   A human being with no conscience.
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:23.520]   Yeah.
[00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:25.520]   A killing machine that doesn't care.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:26.520]   Yeah.
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:29.200]   Better, more powerful than being a flying movie.
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:30.200]   Yeah, many of them.
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:36.240]   And it can be replicated in factories like iPhones, just cranking these things out.
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.240]   Aren't we doing...
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.240]   Aren't we...
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:39.240]   Isn't Google making all that?
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.240]   Yeah.
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.440]   We're pushing us in that direction.
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:42.440]   Yeah.
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:44.440]   I mean, just saying.
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:47.200]   So Larry gets his Google Island and we're not allowed there.
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.200]   Right.
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.200]   I'm sorry.
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.200]   You must have died.
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:51.200]   That's the robots.
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:57.280]   You know, it would be great if you could use technology like that to make more money.
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:58.280]   Somehow.
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:00.280]   You can't do it.
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:01.280]   It's the track of your financial status.
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:02.440]   Wait, you can with personal capital.
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:07.000]   I'll be back in just a minute with this week in Google our sponsor this week is personal
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   capital.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.200]   I talked to Bill Harris, the founder of personal capital and a triangulation about a year ago.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.000]   In fact, that's when I first got my first personal capital account.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.360]   He was the CEO of PayPal and Intuit and really done a lot of, I think, profound thinking
[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:25.000]   about finance, about money, about our relationship to money.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.160]   One of the things, of course, he learned at Intuit is that people want to keep track
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.000]   of their financial life.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.480]   They want better tools for doing that.
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:33.120]   And that's what personal capital is.
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.800]   It's a dashboard for your financial life.
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:39.320]   You give it your accounts, all of your accounts in a single spot.
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:43.640]   And you know, it's true, is that the more money you have, the more successful you are,
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:47.360]   the more you got to keep track of, the more complicated it becomes.
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:52.160]   You've got checking and savings accounts, retirement accounts, credit cards, investments.
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.160]   You've got mortgages.
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.160]   You've got loans.
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:56.120]   Well, this is what personal capital does.
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:24:01.280]   It puts it all in one place so you can look at it, gives you information that helps you
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:07.080]   make the most of it and investment advice so that you can do the right thing and then
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:08.080]   reap the benefits.
[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:11.920]   I think this is a, I've been very, very happy with personal capital.
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:12.920]   I want you to try it.

[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.160]   So it is a final exam time.
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:46.760]   I know Henry just finished his exams.
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:47.760]   He's coming home.
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:48.760]   Happy finished her exams today.
[00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:52.480]   Our students have headed for home, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:58.520]   There was a kid at Harvard didn't really want to take his exams.
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:03.720]   And what we know now was a kid because there was a bomb threat thrown into Harvard and
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:06.640]   he actually emailed bomb threat to Harvard.
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:15.240]   And the suspect, when Bruce Schnire on security, did everything he could to be anonymous.
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:17.180]   He used an anonymous email account.
[00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:20.480]   He used Tor, the onion router.
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:27.920]   And nevertheless, the FBI was able to identify the suspect, we got to say the suspect, and
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:31.000]   make an arrest.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.880]   Turns out, according to the criminal complaint, Bruce Schnire read it, the FBI got itself
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:42.340]   a list of Harvard users that had accessed Tor and went through them one by one to figure
[00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:44.600]   out who it was sent the threat.
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:47.600]   Oof, ow.
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:50.980]   When you think on their network, right, which meant they actually had the packets going
[00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:51.980]   out.
[00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:52.980]   Yeah.
[00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:56.580]   So he did what you would say would think would be a smart thing created in the corner
[00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:59.300]   of gone to the town library to do that.
[00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:01.280]   That would have been better.
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:02.280]   That would be better.
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:03.280]   Yeah.
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:04.620]   Yeah, but I guess he did it from his dorm room.
[00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:06.260]   Hey, he was behind on his exams.
[00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:07.860]   He didn't have time to go to the library.
[00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:09.020]   If he had, he could have studied.
[00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:13.820]   You know, the famous story of Zuckerberg and his art final?
[00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:14.820]   No.
[00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:20.520]   That I heard him tell the story that he had not, he was too busy starting a hundred
[00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:21.760]   billion dollar company.
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:24.920]   He had the state for his art final at all.
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:29.520]   And he put up all of the pictures that they were supposed to analyze and set everybody
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.680]   an email saying I put up a study guide.
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:36.400]   And Harvard students, being Harvard students, fell over themselves to get the best essential
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.120]   descriptions.
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:43.760]   And the professor said that the class got better grades than ever, according to Mark.
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:47.260]   And this, I think, is an example of wonderful crowdsourcing and platform making.
[00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:52.300]   But of course, in the movie about marketing presented as if it was cheating.
[00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:57.620]   Just as the NSA portrayed Edward Snowden as a cheater on its 60 minutes piece.
[00:26:57.620 --> 00:26:59.540]   Oh, that was most dreadful.
[00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:02.980]   The fall of 60 minutes, 60 minutes.
[00:27:02.980 --> 00:27:05.820]   The last Tiffany Gem has gone.
[00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:08.980]   It's a bad Kubrick, Zircona, a piece of CVS now.
[00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:11.820]   It was just an absolute dreadful date.
[00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:18.600]   After having gotten in trouble for assigning a military fan to do a story on the military.
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:22.060]   X, X, X, employee of the director of national intelligence.
[00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:25.360]   He put a security fan to do the security story in John Miller.
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:26.360]   Yeah.
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:32.160]   Who's who at the same time was trying to come back to the New York NYPD to work for Bratton.
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.400]   So I mean, it's to be, yeah, he's going to quit.
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:39.520]   Now that now he's done his duty, he's going to quit and go to work for the NYPD.
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:40.980]   He is to be fair.
[00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:43.200]   He's done television news reporting for a long time.
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:48.600]   He's a senior correspondent at CBS, but has a lot of connections.
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.200]   And it was a, it was a law enforcement.
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:52.600]   His ass piece to the NSA.
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:55.100]   Well, okay.
[00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:58.800]   Could I, could, could you reasonably position it as it was giving the NSA the chance to
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.440]   tell their side?
[00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:04.240]   But even a reporter who does that should then throw a tough question.
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:07.320]   Other side is to them and ask them tough questions and not do it and not.
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:10.120]   Well, they showed us the door to the secret room.
[00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:11.120]   Yeah.
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:13.940]   You know, I was, it was, it was absolutely dreadful and shameful.
[00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:15.040]   So this is the third strike.
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:16.040]   You got Laura Logan.
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.900]   You got Charlie Rose.
[00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:20.500]   And now you got John Miller.
[00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:22.780]   And let's go back to Dan Rather.
[00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:23.780]   Yeah.
[00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:25.820]   It's, it's, it's the fall of one's.
[00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:28.580]   So what was wrong with this piece?
[00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:31.420]   What was wrong with it?
[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:32.420]   Yeah.
[00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:34.740]   Just that it was not challenging at all.
[00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:35.740]   It was a blacker.
[00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:36.740]   It was flakery.
[00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:45.020]   And just look at like the, the description of Snowden as a, they even used some ad hominem
[00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:50.320]   attack that seemed completely not germane that he, when he was at home, computing, put
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:52.060]   a hood over himself.
[00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:55.860]   And his girlfriend thought that was weird.
[00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:59.000]   It's like that was, that seemed like a completely ad hominem.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.400]   Well, no, I mean, but actually it was only a smart thing.
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:03.780]   The Guardian and this has now been made public.
[00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:09.140]   The Guardian was warned that they shouldn't have anything and say anything in offices.
[00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:12.900]   Their offices are very windowed on, on, on next to a canal in London.
[00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:17.740]   And that other agents could come and use lasers bouncing off of plastic cups on their
[00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:19.860]   desks to hear and see what they said.
[00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:21.540]   They can do that, by the way.
[00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:22.540]   Yes.
[00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:24.860]   So, so that's why he used a hood, obviously.
[00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:25.860]   Right.
[00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:30.780]   To me, the problem was that they presented a very strong side of the story, which there
[00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:33.100]   isn't necessarily anything wrong with that.
[00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:36.500]   But then they pretended as if it were not controversial.
[00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:41.820]   They didn't bring out, doesn't collect phone information on American citizens, just metadata,
[00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:44.660]   which adjudged the next day, ruled unconstitutional.
[00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:45.660]   Exactly.
[00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:46.660]   Exactly.
[00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:49.060]   And so, and so that just looks foolish.
[00:29:49.060 --> 00:29:50.060]   Yep.
[00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:52.100]   I mean, obviously I'm a fan of the Guardian.
[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:53.620]   I work with the Guardian full disclosure.
[00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:55.780]   I'm a fan of what Snowden is doing.
[00:29:55.780 --> 00:30:00.140]   That's my view of the story and fine, but then present that view of the story and hear
[00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:02.220]   the NSA's best arguments against it.
[00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:07.220]   I moderated a panel with Bob Kerry, in which he went after me about just these topics with
[00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:13.260]   Yochai Bekler and Bob Kerry going after a lot.
[00:30:13.260 --> 00:30:17.900]   And my position was clear, but Bob Kerry was there to present the best that he could
[00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:19.820]   for that side.
[00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:20.820]   That's what that's what's going on.
[00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:21.820]   We've even done that on this show.
[00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:24.060]   I've tried to represent the NSA side.
[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:26.060]   You were the Stuart Baker character.
[00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:27.060]   Back to Stuart.
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:28.540]   Stuart did email us.
[00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:30.820]   And I apologize to if we're not getting back to you.
[00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:33.420]   We'll get them on the show, I think that would be very interesting.
[00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:34.420]   Yeah.
[00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:37.860]   Because there are two sides to this.
[00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:42.060]   I don't, but that was a fairly self-serving piece for the NSA.
[00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:49.100]   By the way, the NSA report, the committee, I would say, dubiously appointed committee
[00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:53.820]   just released its report minutes ago, 46 major recommendations.
[00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:55.900]   It's 300 pages.
[00:30:55.900 --> 00:31:00.340]   The funny thing is they didn't invite the Guardian to the announcement.
[00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:03.340]   The joke on Twitter as well, of course the Guardian already had it.
[00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:06.020]   Somebody leaked it to him.
[00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:11.380]   What about this contention that Snowden has millions or at least a million more documents,
[00:31:11.380 --> 00:31:13.820]   some of which could be very detrimental to the US.
[00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:17.660]   I think there was a misinterpretation of what Allen Rosperger, the editor of the Guardian,
[00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:21.140]   said in Parliament because he said that 1% of the documents were out.
[00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:24.540]   And I don't know this from Allen, I mean to ask them, but I think that my interpretation
[00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:30.060]   of what he said was he was talking about actual physical views of the documents.
[00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:35.460]   And whereas I think that they've used a tremendous number of documents already in the reporting.
[00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:38.420]   And yes, there is more stuff that's there.
[00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:42.620]   The shocking thing is that they can't find out how much he has because the monitoring
[00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:46.980]   software wasn't existent, wasn't turned on in the office where he wasn't Hawaii.
[00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:49.020]   And the Snowden knew that.
[00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:52.900]   And so he was able to get more in a short time.
[00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:57.540]   But I come back to the argument that nothing bad has happened from Snowden's revelations.
[00:31:57.540 --> 00:31:58.620]   They have been responsible.
[00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:03.140]   They have brought things into the public discussion that needed to be brought in the public discussion,
[00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:07.420]   witness that decision about metadata and phone metadata, witness the fact that there's a
[00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:11.660]   report today from a committee reviewing what the NSA is doing, witness the fact that our
[00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:14.140]   allies are also questioning what happens with surveillance.
[00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:17.900]   This is important to have a discussion of a democracy and it was here only because of
[00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:20.020]   whatever the Snowden did.
[00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:21.340]   He shouldn't have had to do.
[00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:24.300]   The system should be better.
[00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:26.100]   But that's where it is.
[00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:30.980]   Meanwhile, the heads of many of the big technology companies, including Eric Schmidt of Google
[00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:37.580]   Marissa Meyer at Yahoo LinkedIn AOL, all of the big companies met with President Obama
[00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:39.140]   yesterday.
[00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:43.980]   Schmidt began the meeting by going over those five principles we talked about in the full
[00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:55.620]   page ad and the website begging the president to change government surveillance programs.
[00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:58.860]   And I think that's a very important thing to do.
[00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:01.860]   I think that's a very important thing to do.
[00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:04.700]   I think that's a very important thing to do.
[00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:07.180]   I think that's a very important thing to do.
[00:33:07.180 --> 00:33:10.140]   I think that's a very important thing to do.
[00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:12.740]   I think that's a very important thing to do.
[00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:15.740]   I think that's a very important thing to do.
[00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:18.780]   I think that's a very important thing to do.
[00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:21.140]   I think that's a very important thing to do.
[00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:26.140]   I also gave more than $1 million to the Obama campaign.
[00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:28.020]   All of the two of them contributed to Obama.
[00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:29.020]   That's interesting.
[00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:31.020]   AT&T didn't and Eric Schmidt didn't.
[00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:33.500]   AT&T's Randall Stevenson, I think his name is.
[00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:34.500]   He was there.
[00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:35.500]   He was the CEO of AT&T.
[00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:37.500]   He made a huge contribution to Romney.
[00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:43.260]   He's there because AT&T is, I believe, the number one contributed to political campaigns
[00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:47.940]   and political parties in the world, in the US.
[00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:51.420]   AT&T drops a lot of money in Washington.
[00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:58.580]   Is this just a photo op or do you think there really were, there was any intent on the part
[00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:00.580]   of the administration to listen to these guys?
[00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:03.460]   This is the economic engine that drives the United States.
[00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:10.740]   It's not an industrial, but in terms of the information age, these are the big names,
[00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:11.740]   the big companies.
[00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:15.020]   Obviously, nothing's going to happen to this me.
[00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:21.380]   But in optics, as they like to say, the fact that eight major companies took out that full
[00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:27.060]   page ad directly to the president and Congress, giving them principles to live by that they
[00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:34.660]   have not created, and that this meeting then occurs, says that it didn't fall on deaf ears.
[00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:39.380]   It may have felt on obstinate ears, but not deaf ears, and that there is something that
[00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:40.380]   we're talking about here.
[00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:41.780]   Again, we're having the debate.
[00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:42.780]   Thanks to Edward Snowden.
[00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:44.780]   We're having it.
[00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:45.780]   Yes, so there it is.
[00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:50.420]   And so there's an obvious political pressure that's here, and it had to be dealt with, and
[00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:52.180]   still has to be dealt with.
[00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:58.500]   Marissa Mayer, CEO at Yahoo warned the president of Balkanization of the Internet as international
[00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:03.140]   companies, international governments, don't stop dealing with American companies for fear
[00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:04.140]   of spying.
[00:35:04.140 --> 00:35:09.500]   Dick Costolo was there from Twitter, Brad Smith, General Counsel at Microsoft, Vice President,
[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:15.500]   General Counsel at LinkedIn, CEO of Etsy, CEO of Netflix, Reed Hastings was there.
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:22.460]   Drew Houston of Dropbox was there at Zynga, Shervan Pishivar, Brian Roberts of Comcast.
[00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:24.740]   It's kind of an odd list if you think about it.
[00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:29.780]   Well, it's not an odd list when you think that all but two contributed to the Obama campaign.
[00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:34.300]   The other thing is that this whole NSA thing is taking off the table a whole bunch of other
[00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:37.180]   issues that I think should be on the table as well.
[00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:43.220]   I mean, this NSA scandal is really screwing American technology companies.
[00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:50.100]   Yeah, but we, Congress issued a warning last year that we shouldn't be buying phones from
[00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:53.940]   Huawei and ZTE because they were partly owned by the Chinese government.
[00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:55.940]   I mean, it's a two-way...
[00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:57.620]   Well, but don't we trust anybody anymore?
[00:35:57.620 --> 00:36:06.380]   But the NSA, one of their highest priorities should be protecting Silicon Valley from the
[00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:07.380]   Chinese.
[00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:08.380]   They even say that's their agenda.
[00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:10.580]   And they fail completely to do that.
[00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:15.500]   There are some recent reports coming out demonstrating that the Chinese government just
[00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:19.780]   pretty much gets every secret they want, every military and technology secret and they're
[00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:21.900]   into industrial espionage and all these other things.
[00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:23.340]   And what does the NSA doing about that?
[00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:24.980]   What is the federal government doing about that?
[00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:27.340]   No, instead of doing the opposite.
[00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:31.060]   You're giving a corollary argument to the one that, well, everybody else spies so we
[00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:32.060]   should too.
[00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:33.420]   Well, the Chinese do bad stuff.
[00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:36.060]   That doesn't, any means justify us doing it as well.
[00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:43.500]   No, but I have a feeling that Chinese government was loath to buy American goods before.
[00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:44.500]   Yes.
[00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:45.500]   Right.
[00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:46.500]   I mean, this is...
[00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:48.100]   I mean, maybe the Germans now.
[00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:51.100]   Except Cisco goods they use to make the Great Firewall.
[00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:52.100]   Right.
[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:53.100]   Right.
[00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:55.460]   Well, that's part of the problem is if you don't get it from the US, there's a lot of stuff
[00:36:55.460 --> 00:36:57.820]   you can't get.
[00:36:57.820 --> 00:36:58.820]   Yeah.
[00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:01.060]   What do you think of this, Kevin Marks?
[00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:02.380]   You're an international terror.
[00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:03.380]   I'm a person.
[00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:04.380]   International traveler.
[00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:05.380]   Traveler.
[00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:06.380]   Man of mystery.
[00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:08.900]   Have you ever been cavity searched at the border?
[00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:13.660]   I hope you pay your maid well.
[00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:17.340]   I did get searched on my way out of the country for having too many wires in my bag.
[00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:18.340]   Oh, yeah.
[00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:20.340]   Well, I feel I'll have that problem.
[00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:22.980]   Actually, no, that was going from London to Paris.
[00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:26.220]   That's when I got searched there.
[00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:30.620]   You know, there's something I went addressing with the more meeting with the president, but
[00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:33.180]   at least that's useful when addressing.
[00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:37.740]   It's changed for being called before Congress testified because they've done, they've eventually
[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:42.820]   done something wrong, which was the previous pattern.
[00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:46.140]   I think the other subjects of that meeting was they said, "Oh, we're asking them to help
[00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:48.780]   us sort out the healthcare website."
[00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:49.780]   Yeah.
[00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:50.780]   That was kind of a...
[00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:51.780]   Yeah.
[00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:53.300]   But then they appointed someone for Microsoft to do that.
[00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:54.300]   Right.
[00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:55.620]   It was also kind of odd.
[00:37:55.620 --> 00:38:00.220]   So, you know, there's a bunch of structural bits and pieces there.
[00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:05.140]   You know, there's kind of a recognition that these companies are doing useful things and
[00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:06.140]   they should...
[00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:07.140]   The government should listen to them all.
[00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:12.840]   And certainly, I know that they've got some smart people who are working at the White
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:15.420]   House now who come from the valley.
[00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:20.580]   Again, there was a sort of wave of that when the first Obama administration came in.
[00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:24.860]   There's another wave that going on now where people are moving there in the office of
[00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:26.220]   the CTO and things.
[00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:29.180]   So hopefully, they'll be paying a bit more attention.
[00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:37.540]   One of the UK angle on this is that they've invested very heavily in building up expertise
[00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:40.660]   in open source and open standards within government.
[00:38:40.660 --> 00:38:44.780]   And the Cabinet Office has the government data services team that is explicitly trying
[00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:49.180]   to reinvent government websites so that they don't cost millions of dollars and get farmed
[00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:53.500]   out to ridiculously expensive contractors but are able to build on open source technologies
[00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:55.620]   and reuse things where they need to.
[00:38:55.620 --> 00:39:01.180]   That's definitely a trend that's welcome and starting to bear some fruit in the UK.
[00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:04.900]   Something that's been going on for maybe three years, three or four years there.
[00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:12.140]   Angela Merkel, we are learning now after hearing from Der Spiegel that the Americans were listening
[00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:17.700]   to her personal cell phone called President Obama and said, "This is like the Stazie,
[00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:20.180]   the East German secret police that she...
[00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:21.180]   She was an East German."
[00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:25.300]   So she had some experience with.
[00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:30.940]   She was particularly angry, according to The New York Times, that the NSA "couldn't be
[00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:35.460]   trusted with private information because they let Snowden clean them out."
[00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:41.660]   So A, she pissed off that we're spying on her and B, that damn Snowden guy, cleaned
[00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:42.660]   you out.
[00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:45.220]   Well, same with your Senator Feinstein.
[00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:49.340]   She, you know, NSA was fine and wonderful and glorious until one of her own, that is
[00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:53.100]   to say Angela Merkel, one of that level got hacked and then that's when she got mad.
[00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:54.100]   Yeah.
[00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:59.460]   And now Feinstein, after the court decision about the metadata, Feinstein said, "Well,
[00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:01.580]   it's good to have, but not all that credit."
[00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:04.460]   Well, not long ago she was saying it was vital to have that to stop terror.
[00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:09.020]   The metadata, well, see, this is the thing and I think this is why the 60-minute piece
[00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:14.580]   tells you a lot about what the NSA thinks the American people will tolerate, what the
[00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:16.860]   American people understand.
[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:21.060]   And I think that they're very clear that the American people don't think metadata is
[00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:22.060]   an issue.
[00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:24.660]   It's a big deal, they know what calls I made to whom, when.
[00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:25.660]   Right.
[00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:28.020]   So what, they're not listening to the calls, that's what I'm worried about.
[00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:33.780]   But those of us who follow this stuff, and that includes all of you watching and listening,
[00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:38.220]   know that big data, this is precisely the kind of data that you can use to find out
[00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:39.220]   all sorts of stuff.
[00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:40.740]   You don't really need the call content.
[00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:41.740]   Right.
[00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:47.220]   The metadata process that they're using is precisely the thing that makes it unconstitutional.
[00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:52.180]   They want this data so that they can go fishing for crimes or terrorism acts or things like
[00:40:52.180 --> 00:40:55.660]   that because actually what they're trying to do is solve pre-crime.
[00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:57.500]   That's, this is a minority report stuff here.
[00:40:57.500 --> 00:40:59.220]   They're not trying to solve crimes.
[00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:01.380]   They're trying to stop crimes before they happen.
[00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:03.020]   And so they feel that they need this tool.
[00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:08.060]   But essentially metadata just enables them to go on these phishing expeditions and all
[00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:09.380]   these things have slippery slopes.
[00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:10.380]   Let's say-
[00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:11.380]   Well, I think that's exactly right.
[00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:14.620]   And let's, by the way, the review panel, the NSA review panel is releasing its findings
[00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:15.620]   right now.
[00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:17.620]   And right up front, one of the first things they said-
[00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:18.820]   I was just going to read that.
[00:41:18.820 --> 00:41:20.220]   This is fascinating.
[00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:22.220]   This is from the report.
[00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:27.420]   Finally, the report says, "We cannot discount the risk in light of the lessons of our own
[00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:32.580]   history that at some point in the future high level government officials will decide that
[00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:38.420]   this massive database of extraordinarily sensitive private information is there for the plucking."
[00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:43.620]   And here's the big quote, the pull quote, "Americans must never make the mistake of
[00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:46.660]   wholly trusting our public officials."
[00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:49.420]   This is from the government review panel.
[00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:51.460]   Yeah, this is from the rubber stamp.
[00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:52.460]   So it's so strong.
[00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:53.460]   Holy cow.
[00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:58.140]   The next post there, it says that metadata can reveal, quote, "calls to the psychiatrists,
[00:41:58.140 --> 00:42:01.620]   the plastic surgeon, the abortion clinic, the AIDS treatment," and so on.
[00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:04.700]   Knowing that the government has ready access to one's phone call records can seriously
[00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:09.380]   chill associational and expressive freedoms and knowing that the government is one flick
[00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:13.780]   of a switch away from such information can profoundly quote alter the relationship between
[00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:18.220]   citizen and government in a way that is in nimical to society.
[00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:19.220]   Boom!
[00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:24.140]   So, Edward Snowden should be banned from this country forever because he causes debate.
[00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:27.180]   Yeah, we were- he revealed that horrible secret.
[00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:31.260]   So that was to me the big takeaway of the 60-minute piece.
[00:42:31.260 --> 00:42:34.220]   The NSA did in fact say, "Yes, we're hoovering up all call records.
[00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:35.220]   Yes, we are.
[00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:37.060]   And we're saving them for years."
[00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:39.580]   That's just the metadata, folks.
[00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:40.580]   Tells you two things.
[00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:41.580]   One, they admit it.
[00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:44.300]   Two, they think you're too stupid to know what the implications of that.
[00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:50.820]   And also, this is the problem of regulating to technologies rather than principles.
[00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:51.820]   Right?
[00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:53.900]   So let's move this back to mail.
[00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:58.140]   The first example you're using the show many times is that your contents of a first-class
[00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:03.460]   letter or package can be searched only with warrant.
[00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:04.780]   We agree with that as a society.
[00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:06.620]   That's what should happen.
[00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:10.660]   And of course, that didn't extend over to email itself because of all the reasons we've
[00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:11.660]   discussed.
[00:43:11.660 --> 00:43:15.740]   Now, when we get to the metadata side, the presumption about metadata is that, well,
[00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:18.620]   it can be seen by the Postman, it can be seen by anybody, so it's okay.
[00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:24.340]   So to this day, the USPS now photographs the cover of every single letter that is mailed.
[00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:29.140]   Now, the argument might still be made that, well, that's just- that's just, you know,
[00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:30.140]   who sent to whom?
[00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:31.140]   What's the big deal?
[00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:35.660]   But now what the Monday decision said about metadata is that, sorry, the NSA turned off
[00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:43.940]   my lights, is that now there's that much more data that lets you put together a very complex
[00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:46.380]   mosaic of life around this metadata.
[00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:51.940]   So there's a continuum here that either says that our communication is syncrosanct or not,
[00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:55.860]   regardless of technology, and it either says that metadata is presumed to be public or
[00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:57.300]   not.
[00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:59.220]   And they got it both ways, right?
[00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:04.420]   They said, well, no, our communication is not protected, but metadata is always okay.
[00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:08.260]   And we have to regulate this to principles, which is what the technology companies, at
[00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:11.740]   least, are starting to go with the White House on.
[00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:16.900]   And what they're saying is, technology companies don't Hoover everything, go after specific
[00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:18.620]   cases in specific matters.
[00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:23.820]   And that is what the law was until 9/11.
[00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:27.700]   The three major telecoms, this is fascinating.
[00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:33.180]   So what's happening is they released the report, which is very long and very dense, hundreds
[00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:35.820]   of very dense pages.
[00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:40.260]   And now people at the Guardian and elsewhere are parsing through it, and they're live
[00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:44.060]   blocking it as they as they read it, which is which is great.
[00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:49.220]   Yeah, watching the live the live blog of the Guardian, Glenn Greenwald tweeting, wouldn't
[00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:54.340]   it be increasingly hard to say Snowden is a felon deserving decades in prison when the
[00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:59.340]   courts and the White House's own panel are saying all of this.
[00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:04.300]   Some business correspondent Dominic Rush is one of the people looking at it, finds some
[00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:09.420]   interesting ambivalence in the telecom industry about new restrictions on NSA access to customer
[00:45:09.420 --> 00:45:10.420]   data.
[00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:15.180]   AT&T Verizon has sprint declined to comment on the new proposal to have them hold customer
[00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:16.700]   data on NSA's behalf.
[00:45:16.700 --> 00:45:20.780]   But one executive warned it could create as many problems as it solved.
[00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:22.460]   Quote, it would be costly for us.
[00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:27.220]   And more than that, it would potentially open access to consumer data to other government
[00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:28.740]   agencies.
[00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:33.300]   Once we know once they know that we are holding the information, what's to stop the IRS for
[00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:34.980]   asking for our segment?
[00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:35.980]   Exactly.
[00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:39.180]   It wouldn't just be the NSA anymore.
[00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:42.780]   But also the telcos have a liquid of business in billing the government.
[00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:44.620]   They make good money on it.
[00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:49.940]   That's one of the reasons that the AT&T lot wouldn't sign on to the thing the other companies
[00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:52.580]   said was they didn't want to talk about this.
[00:45:52.580 --> 00:45:56.900]   But they've already had the retroactive immunity thing written into the law.
[00:45:56.900 --> 00:46:01.020]   But also they have this, they basically say, yeah, sure, you can have that data that'll
[00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:02.420]   cost you this much.
[00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:05.220]   And they've turned it into a revenue stream.
[00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:06.220]   Right.
[00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:08.460]   And one question of why didn't Amazon sign the letter?
[00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:10.380]   Oh, you know, one speculation.
[00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:14.300]   It's just speculation that I hear around as Amazon has CIA contracts.
[00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:15.300]   I don't know.
[00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:20.060]   I don't mean to smirk, but you have a lot of data about us Amazon.
[00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:21.740]   You are the library of today.
[00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:28.500]   Companies have a ethical view that they should never release the card of what you read.
[00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:31.500]   So Amazon, are you a library or not?
[00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:32.500]   Right.
[00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:35.340]   Well, there'll be lots more.
[00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:41.940]   And the good news is Patrick Leahy has asked for a January test of money on this report,
[00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:47.100]   which means it'll keep it in the news cycle because this is actually a great time from
[00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:48.100]   the NSA.
[00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:50.740]   It's going to release this information because nobody's paying any attention to the position.
[00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:51.740]   It'll be nice of green walled.
[00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:52.740]   Yeah, it's right before Christmas.
[00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:55.740]   It'll be nice of green walled and snowed and could justify as well.
[00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:57.700]   Yeah, by a Skype.
[00:46:57.700 --> 00:47:06.380]   Of course, Google and Facebook, according to the Wall Street Journal, are expanding their
[00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:09.620]   efforts to control the world's internet backbone.
[00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:15.380]   It's currently controlled, at least in the US, by the telecoms, Sprint, AT&T, Sprint's,
[00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:17.980]   I think the biggest.
[00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:23.620]   Google has spent years piecing together its own network of private fiber optic cables,
[00:47:23.620 --> 00:47:27.300]   now has more than 100,000 miles of backbone route throughout the world.
[00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:31.580]   That's bigger than Sprint, which is 40,000 miles.
[00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:38.500]   And to reduce costs and probably also to increase privacy, Google and Facebook are starting
[00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:43.660]   to light these dark fiber cables to provide their own backbone.
[00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:44.660]   This is amazing.
[00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:48.100]   Google and Facebook have undersea cables to Asia.
[00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:53.460]   Yeah, all the way from California to Japan.
[00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:55.980]   That is a big C, the Pacific Ocean.
[00:47:55.980 --> 00:47:56.980]   Wow.
[00:47:56.980 --> 00:48:03.740]   Yeah, I mean, this actually hints of this began about nine years ago when a technology publication
[00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:08.660]   called Light Reading noticed a job listing for somebody whose job was essentially to go
[00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:10.500]   shopping for dark fiber.
[00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:14.780]   And by the way, for people who don't know what dark fiber is, dark fiber is fiber optic cable
[00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:16.860]   that has been laid but isn't being used.
[00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:17.860]   It's not lit up.
[00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:18.860]   Right.
[00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:23.380]   Because what happened in the tech boom in the 90s, all the irrational exuberance caused
[00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:26.060]   the telcos to just invest massively in fiber.
[00:48:26.060 --> 00:48:28.900]   They thought it was all going to be used up and then nobody used it.
[00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:30.500]   So it's been sitting there all this time.
[00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:34.820]   And so wealthy companies like Google can come along and buy it.
[00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:35.820]   That's one thing they're doing.
[00:48:35.820 --> 00:48:37.140]   They're also laying their own.
[00:48:37.140 --> 00:48:38.540]   And they're all doing it for different reasons.
[00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:43.940]   For example, Facebook is either doing dark fiber or they're laying their own cables so
[00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:47.940]   that they can have this massive data center near the Arctic Circle.
[00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:48.940]   Whoa.
[00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:51.980]   Because they're cooling cheap because they're cooling cheap cheap up there just open the
[00:48:51.980 --> 00:48:54.580]   window and the end of the laws are somewhat better too.
[00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:55.580]   Yeah.
[00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:58.940]   And Microsoft is using it for a similar purpose, which is that they're going to super inexpensive
[00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:00.980]   areas for their data centers to operate.
[00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:04.420]   Google just wants massively high speed internet at low cost.
[00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:11.500]   And in fact, I've encountered this myself in Istanbul earlier this year.
[00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:15.740]   I got a chance to go to the Google office and use their internet and wow.
[00:49:15.740 --> 00:49:16.740]   Wow.
[00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:18.980]   In Istanbul, this was a blistering fast.
[00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:20.540]   That's the internet connection.
[00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:21.540]   Yeah.
[00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:28.020]   So they, their Google offices have fiber to the nearest hub or something because it's
[00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:29.660]   just blisteringly fast.
[00:49:29.660 --> 00:49:31.260]   And it's a fascinating thing.
[00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:36.300]   And it turns out actually that when Google goes to telcos to make these deals for Google
[00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:38.180]   fiber, they, the telcos have a contract.
[00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:41.340]   So we like to assign this and Google says, get rid of it.
[00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:42.340]   Here's our contract.
[00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:43.340]   Yeah.
[00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:44.500]   Take it or leave it.
[00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:46.020]   And they have all the power now.
[00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:50.420]   Well, but also they have to do deals with the Department of Homeland Security as they
[00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:54.660]   lay these cables to, to protect US interests.
[00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:57.780]   It must be a, it must be a hell of a negotiation.
[00:49:57.780 --> 00:49:58.780]   Yeah.
[00:49:58.780 --> 00:49:59.780]   But why should the telcos own this?
[00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:00.780]   Right.
[00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:02.380]   You know, that's just, that's for historic reasons.
[00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:04.540]   Well, but there's, there's some conspiracy to do.
[00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:06.220]   Oh, no, the big companies are running it bigger.
[00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:08.460]   Well, the telcos, no, we're on that letter.
[00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:11.780]   We're in that, in that group, the telcos are not protecting your interests and your rights.
[00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:13.900]   You're better off in the hands of Google and the us Facebook.
[00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:14.900]   Right.
[00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:16.060]   They have opposite incentives.
[00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:17.060]   Yes.
[00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:21.180]   The Google's in the Facebook's have an incentive to make the internet as fast and cheap as possible.
[00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:23.420]   And the telcos have it the opposite.
[00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:27.820]   And so that's why I'm on the side of, yeah.
[00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:30.900]   But don't, don't Google and Facebook also spy on us in order.
[00:50:30.900 --> 00:50:33.020]   That's their finite, that's their business model.
[00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:34.020]   Sure.
[00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:35.020]   That's not spying.
[00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:36.020]   Oh, Leo, that's not spying.
[00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:39.500]   That's a transaction of information for in return for relevance.
[00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:41.260]   But faster than explicit.
[00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:43.060]   Yes, it's explicit.
[00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:44.060]   You better this.
[00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:45.060]   I told Google where I am.
[00:50:45.060 --> 00:50:46.060]   Why not?
[00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:48.260]   Google, I would argue is probably more explicit than Facebook.
[00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:49.260]   Yeah.
[00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:52.860]   Does Facebook make it explicit?
[00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:54.700]   Facebook, Facebook does not make it very explicit.
[00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:59.740]   But they, when they talk about making the world more open and available, they do say
[00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:00.740]   that stuff.
[00:51:00.740 --> 00:51:03.180]   Open and available to us so we can sell more ads.
[00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:04.180]   Right.
[00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:10.380]   But they, you know, this week they, they were somebody pointed out that Facebook is indexing
[00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:15.100]   the text you type but don't send as part of their trying to make more sense of what you're
[00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:16.100]   doing.
[00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:17.100]   Yeah, I like that.
[00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:18.100]   That's a good one.
[00:51:18.100 --> 00:51:19.100]   Yeah.
[00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:24.540]   So if you said, if you decide to send a status update, man am I drunk?
[00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:26.300]   And then go, I better not send that.
[00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:27.580]   Don't worry, Facebook's already got it.
[00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:28.580]   It's okay.
[00:51:28.580 --> 00:51:29.580]   Yeah.
[00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:30.580]   Yeah.
[00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:35.740]   I think, I think the question of privacy and all that kind of stuff is separate from the
[00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:36.740]   issue of bandwidth.
[00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:42.540]   I mean, half the bandwidth in the US is, or maybe even in the world is used up by YouTube.
[00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:45.380]   That's actually one of the big problems that Google has.
[00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:46.380]   Right, exactly.
[00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:48.660]   And a third in the US is used up by Netflix.
[00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:49.660]   Netflix.
[00:51:49.660 --> 00:51:52.660]   And so, you know, if they're going to, if they're going to harvest, I personal information,
[00:51:52.660 --> 00:51:54.660]   at least they'll do it faster.
[00:51:54.660 --> 00:51:56.660]   Get it over with.
[00:51:56.660 --> 00:52:02.300]   Yeah, I mean, I trust Google more than I trust government, or at least that's not true.
[00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:06.540]   I trust Google actually about the same, but at least I'm less worried with what they might
[00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:07.540]   do with that information.
[00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:09.780]   They're going to sell ads versus send a tax.
[00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:11.500]   Always the key is government.
[00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:16.220]   That's my argument in my book is that government, fancy self-attector of privacy and across Europe,
[00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:19.700]   in this case, is the worst enemy of privacy because it can gather and use our information
[00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:21.860]   against us in ways no one else can.
[00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:24.300]   But there's another point, yeah, there's another point too.
[00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:26.380]   There are governments and then there are governments.
[00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:30.020]   There's the government that can't put together a healthcare website, completely inept, and
[00:52:30.020 --> 00:52:32.740]   which cannot keep secrets, especially over the long term.
[00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:35.580]   And then there's the NSA, which can keep secrets and does.
[00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:37.940]   And, you know, that's an entirely different thing.
[00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:42.500]   That's why we can't trust the NSA because they are a secret organization and they do
[00:52:42.500 --> 00:52:45.340]   stuff and they expect to get away with stealing.
[00:52:45.340 --> 00:52:47.540]   I mean, they're in the stealing information business.
[00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:49.420]   That's what they do.
[00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:53.300]   And so without oversight, who knows what they're doing?
[00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:54.300]   Rest of the government.
[00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:55.300]   Yeah, I mean, all the facts are going to happen.
[00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:57.260]   There's no oversight on private industry at all.
[00:52:57.260 --> 00:52:59.380]   Oh, yes, there is the world.
[00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:00.380]   Who watches Google?
[00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:03.020]   Well, they'll depend on the market.
[00:53:03.020 --> 00:53:04.020]   The market?
[00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:07.620]   There is legal oversight in different countries.
[00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:10.220]   It varies a bit as well.
[00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:12.460]   There are privacy laws in Europe that are strict to them.
[00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:15.940]   They are here, but here there are data breach laws that are different from Europe.
[00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:19.100]   So you can integrate between them and get something out of it.
[00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:23.060]   And then there's the SEC and the European Union and everybody's always trying to go
[00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:26.460]   after them to reveal what they're doing and all that kind of stuff.
[00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:27.460]   Right.
[00:53:27.460 --> 00:53:32.500]   And media, you know, the idiocy, I still think it was idiotic, that Google getting accused
[00:53:32.500 --> 00:53:37.580]   of stealing data that was on open airway, that's what happened to bride by certain houses.
[00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:42.580]   Look at the who-how about that that certainly acted as a check on Google.
[00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:46.140]   I think it was a stupid check, but it was a check that less.
[00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:47.140]   I agree.
[00:53:47.140 --> 00:53:54.340]   If people are broadcasting passwords into the public, you know, unencrypted passwords into
[00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:59.220]   the street, it's not up to, you know, it's not up to, it's like putting a billboard in
[00:53:59.220 --> 00:54:03.180]   front of your house and then blaming people for reading it.
[00:54:03.180 --> 00:54:05.300]   That's really an important point, Mike.
[00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:06.300]   Important point, Mike, I think.
[00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:11.260]   I think that in this entire discussion, again and again and again, I see efforts to say,
[00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:12.500]   you can't know that.
[00:54:12.500 --> 00:54:13.900]   You can't have that knowledge.
[00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:17.580]   That is a very dangerous thing for society to ever say.
[00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:23.500]   Whether it's you can't know about your prostate or you can't know some information that passes
[00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:24.500]   in the public airway.
[00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:26.180]   You're not allowed to know that.
[00:54:26.180 --> 00:54:27.180]   That's dangerous.
[00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:30.620]   You're not allowed to use it in this way or that.
[00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:31.620]   That's appropriate.
[00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:36.580]   And it is part of what we should be talking about in legislation and regulation and more
[00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:43.460]   ways and norms, but not knowing something, never tell me what I can't know, never.
[00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:46.620]   And somebody in the chat room did point out and a good point that of course, if Google
[00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:50.660]   and Facebook collect data, there's nothing as we can, as far as we can tell, that keeps
[00:54:50.660 --> 00:54:52.020]   them from giving it to the government.
[00:54:52.020 --> 00:54:55.580]   So anybody's collecting data on you is collecting data on you.
[00:54:55.580 --> 00:54:57.180]   Well, what stops you?
[00:54:57.180 --> 00:54:58.660]   Is the market the pressure?
[00:54:58.660 --> 00:54:59.660]   Yeah.
[00:54:59.660 --> 00:55:00.660]   Well, so they keep it secret.
[00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:04.340]   Market pressure only works if we know it.
[00:55:04.340 --> 00:55:05.660]   Yeah, we don't know.
[00:55:05.660 --> 00:55:10.580]   That's why that's why the companies in the third of their five principles demand transparency.
[00:55:10.580 --> 00:55:15.180]   Yeah, but do they really want to experience or they just want to demand it?
[00:55:15.180 --> 00:55:16.420]   No, I think they want it.
[00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:17.420]   I think they want it.
[00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:20.300]   When it comes to government demanding things, yeah, they want it.
[00:55:20.300 --> 00:55:22.580]   They cost themselves less so, yeah.
[00:55:22.580 --> 00:55:23.580]   Yeah.
[00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:27.300]   Well, yeah, but I always go back to the example of Amazon and I'm criticizing Amazon for
[00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:29.220]   not showing up to this party.
[00:55:29.220 --> 00:55:35.220]   But I think the transactional value of I'm recommending this to you because you bought
[00:55:35.220 --> 00:55:38.380]   that and you can see it and you can change it.
[00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:40.260]   That is the model for where the data goes.
[00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:44.100]   I was dealing with a startup today that's going to get a lot of neat data on people.
[00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:48.620]   And I said the thing to do is to go is to think from day one to be aggressively open
[00:55:48.620 --> 00:55:54.340]   about that to give people the value value from that, give them control over it, and
[00:55:54.340 --> 00:55:57.860]   they'll give you more data in return as long as they trust you and see that there's value
[00:55:57.860 --> 00:55:58.860]   in it.
[00:55:58.860 --> 00:56:00.700]   That's exactly, exactly right.
[00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:07.100]   We have to remember that the alternative to contextual advertising is mass advertising
[00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:11.580]   where they have to essentially program your brain to want certain things because they
[00:56:11.580 --> 00:56:13.940]   want everybody to want the same things on television, for example.
[00:56:13.940 --> 00:56:14.940]   Right.
[00:56:14.940 --> 00:56:15.940]   Makes it easier.
[00:56:15.940 --> 00:56:20.340]   In a world in which they are trying to figure out what you really want to determine your
[00:56:20.340 --> 00:56:21.740]   desires.
[00:56:21.740 --> 00:56:24.460]   That's a much better world and that's worth having.
[00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:27.580]   But again, as Jeff said, as long as they're transparent about it and give you control
[00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:28.580]   over it.
[00:56:28.580 --> 00:56:30.660]   I said you and me, Mike on Google plus said an interesting thing.
[00:56:30.660 --> 00:56:33.540]   He said he'd been working in web advertising for 15 years.
[00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:36.980]   And really the most valuable signal was not what people wanted, but what people didn't
[00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:37.980]   want.
[00:56:37.980 --> 00:56:41.660]   That knowing that they were wasting money on an ad to somebody who was not interested
[00:56:41.660 --> 00:56:43.940]   in that product was actually the most valuable kind of target.
[00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:46.180]   Really, really important.
[00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:50.340]   That's why you see dig pioneered, but a lot of companies, Facebook does this, have a
[00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:52.020]   thumbs down in the ad.
[00:56:52.020 --> 00:56:53.020]   Is this ad useful?
[00:56:53.020 --> 00:56:54.020]   Do you know?
[00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:55.020]   You won't see that again.
[00:56:55.020 --> 00:56:57.260]   Not because they want to be nice to you, but because the company that bought the ad
[00:56:57.260 --> 00:56:59.260]   doesn't want to waste its money.
[00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:05.940]   Google may be designing its own server processors, maybe not designing, just building.
[00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:08.140]   This Google just gets more and more.
[00:57:08.140 --> 00:57:11.820]   Apparently they have plenty of their Intel's fifth largest customer.
[00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:16.180]   They spend hundreds of millions of dollars on server processors every year.
[00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:19.460]   And they've got the manpower and the brain power to design their own server processors.
[00:57:19.460 --> 00:57:22.140]   They'd be based on ARM designs.
[00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:27.380]   So they wouldn't be completely their own thing, but they'd probably be some sort of large-scale
[00:57:27.380 --> 00:57:32.500]   integration based on ARM cores.
[00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:33.900]   They're building their own servers.
[00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:34.900]   Why not?
[00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:39.100]   They've been building their own networks, which is as well for quite a long time.
[00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:40.100]   Really?
[00:57:40.100 --> 00:57:42.540]   Because they wanted throughput that nobody else could do.
[00:57:42.540 --> 00:57:46.460]   So they had to do their own chip design and switch design for that.
[00:57:46.460 --> 00:57:52.100]   Google has always been very smart and very innovative when it comes to building servers
[00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:58.020]   and dealing with servers in the very early years, at least as I learned from In The Plex,
[00:57:58.020 --> 00:57:59.820]   which is a great book.
[00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:00.820]   Stephen Levy's.
[00:58:00.820 --> 00:58:01.820]   Exactly.
[00:58:01.820 --> 00:58:03.580]   And they bought cheap.
[00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:06.020]   They were scrounging together the cheapest computers.
[00:58:06.020 --> 00:58:11.900]   Instead of having the fail-proof servers, they went after the go ahead and let it fail
[00:58:11.900 --> 00:58:13.900]   servers, which were much cheaper.
[00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:18.660]   And then they did a good job with failover technology.
[00:58:18.660 --> 00:58:24.660]   And they were able to build data centers for pennies on the dollar, meaning that they could
[00:58:24.660 --> 00:58:27.460]   be much more powerful for the same amount of money.
[00:58:27.460 --> 00:58:32.100]   They've always been super innovative and super out of the box thinking about this kind
[00:58:32.100 --> 00:58:33.100]   of thing.
[00:58:33.100 --> 00:58:34.900]   And so I'm not surprised at all that they want to do this.
[00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:38.660]   They probably like to build every aspect of their data centers, because that's after
[00:58:38.660 --> 00:58:40.380]   all what Google is.
[00:58:40.380 --> 00:58:46.340]   Is there any PR damage to that that you can't rely on Google to make business?
[00:58:46.340 --> 00:58:48.860]   They're going to ruin companies that they should be more open.
[00:58:48.860 --> 00:58:50.620]   Or is this, yeah, it's understandable business.
[00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:51.620]   Surely.
[00:58:51.620 --> 00:58:52.940]   Well, as long as they just do it in-house, right?
[00:58:52.940 --> 00:58:54.100]   It's only for their own personal use.
[00:58:54.100 --> 00:58:57.660]   If they started selling chips, that might be an issue, right?
[00:58:57.660 --> 00:58:58.660]   But Apple sells chips.
[00:58:58.660 --> 00:59:01.780]   You know, Apple makes their own eight certain chips and chips and their products.
[00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:02.780]   That's not.
[00:59:02.780 --> 00:59:04.980]   But they don't sell chips to write or a lot.
[00:59:04.980 --> 00:59:06.460]   They don't sell chips to write, right?
[00:59:06.460 --> 00:59:07.460]   Google.
[00:59:07.460 --> 00:59:09.460]   Just the point about the arm design.
[00:59:09.460 --> 00:59:13.860]   The arm design is you buy a specification for it and build your own chips the way you
[00:59:13.860 --> 00:59:14.860]   want to do it.
[00:59:14.860 --> 00:59:16.740]   They're not even that great of an asset.
[00:59:16.740 --> 00:59:18.540]   Yeah, they're not even that big of an Intel customer.
[00:59:18.540 --> 00:59:23.260]   They're the fifth biggest customer that they account for only 4.3% of that company's revenue.
[00:59:23.260 --> 00:59:25.860]   So it's even interesting at all went away immediately.
[00:59:25.860 --> 00:59:29.180]   It would be kind of a bad quarter for Intel, but not the end of it.
[00:59:29.180 --> 00:59:30.980]   Who's the number one customer right now?
[00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:31.980]   I don't know.
[00:59:31.980 --> 00:59:32.980]   I don't know.
[00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:38.740]   Who would be the number one customer for Intel processors?
[00:59:38.740 --> 00:59:39.740]   Chatram.
[00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:41.580]   That's your assignment.
[00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:42.580]   We let you go.
[00:59:42.580 --> 00:59:45.180]   Go ahead and be back to us.
[00:59:45.180 --> 00:59:47.180]   Chatram is smarter than Watson.
[00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:49.060]   Forget Watson.
[00:59:49.060 --> 00:59:53.540]   If you've tried to play Jeopardy against the chatroom, you would lose.
[00:59:53.540 --> 00:59:55.620]   You should patent the chatroom.
[00:59:55.620 --> 00:59:59.780]   Well, in a sense, have you heard of local motors?
[00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:01.340]   Local motors have essentially done that.
[01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:04.980]   They have big car companies now coming to them to ask them to take their smarts to use
[01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:07.460]   their chatroom to redesign cars.
[01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:08.460]   Wow.
[01:00:08.460 --> 01:00:09.460]   Wow.
[01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:10.460]   Chatroom.
[01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:13.260]   If it doesn't have knowledge, it gives us a punchline.
[01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:14.660]   Who's the number one customer?
[01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:15.660]   The NSA.
[01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:18.940]   Or guesses, they're doing a lot of that right now, too.
[01:00:18.940 --> 01:00:23.500]   We thought you might want to actually research that, but that's okay.
[01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:26.820]   Google give us and Google take us away.
[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:35.220]   In a 4.3, Android 4.3, really nice feature that allowed you to install apps on Android,
[01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:39.660]   but switch little switches that said the app doesn't get to collect this data or that
[01:00:39.660 --> 01:00:41.500]   data.
[01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:47.660]   The feature removed in Android 4.4.2, Google says it was put in by accident.
[01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:53.460]   The apps, apps, privacy feature is now gone.
[01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:57.580]   So the idea of you putting in an apps but saying, hey, you can't have that app can't
[01:00:57.580 --> 01:01:02.460]   have location information or it can't look at my contacts or so forth.
[01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:04.020]   Now, obviously, that's going to break apps.
[01:01:04.020 --> 01:01:06.380]   If the app expects that information, it could.
[01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:12.500]   No, you can fake them out and give them like always say, yes, I'm going to do it.
[01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:14.780]   You can give them dummy data.
[01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:18.020]   And then they could learn to recognize that only data, I suppose.
[01:01:18.020 --> 01:01:19.020]   This is cool.
[01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:20.020]   I never saw this.
[01:01:20.020 --> 01:01:21.020]   The apps, the apps, they're this.
[01:01:21.020 --> 01:01:23.420]   It's a way of doing the idea.
[01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:26.580]   It's usually all or nothing.
[01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:31.900]   You either accept the apps requests for all, or you just don't install the app, but the
[01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:35.740]   idea that you could give it granular permissions is just great.
[01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:36.740]   Yeah.
[01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:40.700]   And this is one of these trade-offs that we've been training on for a while.
[01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:45.340]   So Facebook now gives you more granular choice for admissions for apps than it used to.
[01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:48.420]   And this is like an education process for users too.
[01:01:48.420 --> 01:01:52.180]   When we first started doing these kinds of auth things, you had to make them all or nothing.
[01:01:52.180 --> 01:01:53.660]   Otherwise, people would just ignore them.
[01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:55.900]   Or if they were giving too many choices, they just click away.
[01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:57.740]   So I don't want to do that.
[01:01:57.740 --> 01:02:01.420]   Now, people want used to it understand the principle, then that's good.
[01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:05.700]   But the challenge is still, how do you understand this contextually?
[01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:11.980]   What's better is with certain kinds of these APIs, if at the point where the app makes
[01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:16.140]   the request and you can understand the context for making the request, you can then give
[01:02:16.140 --> 01:02:18.340]   permission with and understanding what it's trying to do.
[01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:19.340]   iOS does that.
[01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:23.420]   So if you install an app that needs location information, the first time it asks for location
[01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:28.420]   information on iOS, it will pop up things saying, "Do you want this app to be able to do that?"
[01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:30.020]   And you can say no.
[01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:31.180]   Right.
[01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:33.820]   So iOS does have sort of this kind of granularity.
[01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:36.940]   And there are bits and pieces that are a bit like that.
[01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:40.260]   But the challenge is always explaining to the user what it is and not putting too many
[01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:41.260]   of them.
[01:02:41.260 --> 01:02:45.460]   That was the Windows, which was it, Vista, that did this where every time you drive you
[01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:46.460]   anything you can pick up on.
[01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:47.460]   Yeah, use your access control.
[01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:48.460]   Yeah.
[01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:49.460]   We're going to pop up every 30 seconds.
[01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:50.460]   Yeah.
[01:02:50.460 --> 01:02:51.460]   Are you sure you want to do that?
[01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:56.420]   So the balance is, you've got to understand what it's trying to do and say, "This thing
[01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:57.860]   is asking to read your address book."
[01:02:57.860 --> 01:03:00.580]   You're like, "Okay, why is it asking me to read my address book?
[01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:01.580]   What's going on there?"
[01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:04.900]   Or, "This is asking to send a message as you.
[01:03:04.900 --> 01:03:07.220]   It's like, "Show me the message it's going to send.
[01:03:07.220 --> 01:03:10.140]   Show me the messages other people have sent with this app."
[01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:11.940]   Wait a minute, they're all the same.
[01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:13.460]   This app is playing me.
[01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:17.100]   So there are situations like that where it starts getting interesting.
[01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:23.220]   But to say we can't do this in principle is just, that's wrong.
[01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:24.220]   You can do this.
[01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:25.500]   There's lots of ways of doing it.
[01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:30.900]   You can either make the APIs return errors or we can make the APIs return, null data or
[01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:39.420]   minimal data that doesn't mean they can impersonate you or track where you are.
[01:03:39.420 --> 01:03:42.100]   That's very doable and to say it's not, it's kind of silly.
[01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:45.820]   And there are third party ROMs that do this.
[01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:47.300]   Yeah.
[01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:50.740]   And by the way, speaking of ads, Google now only charged for ads that people actually
[01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:51.740]   see.
[01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:52.740]   What?
[01:03:52.740 --> 01:03:54.460]   They were charging for ads that you couldn't see?
[01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:56.340]   Well, almost every media site was.
[01:03:56.340 --> 01:04:00.860]   Actually, I'm going to see this above two years ago where they were alone in the industry
[01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:03.060]   where only if the ads scroll up to your eyesight.
[01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:04.060]   Oh, I see.
[01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:06.260]   So if it's below the fold, that's the goal.
[01:04:06.260 --> 01:04:07.260]   Right, you still pay.
[01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:08.260]   You still pay for it.
[01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:09.260]   That's a page load.
[01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:10.260]   Oh.
[01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:14.180]   And Chartbeat did some very interesting work about three months ago.
[01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:21.940]   A beta works company started where they track your use of a page pixel by pixel.
[01:04:21.940 --> 01:04:25.820]   And so what they found was very interestingly, so advertisers for just that reason would
[01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:28.140]   presume that the ads that were down the page were less valuable.
[01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:30.980]   The most valuable thing you wanted, of course, was the banner across the top.
[01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:34.460]   What Chartbeat found was basically that's a bunch of lettuce that people just scroll
[01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:36.900]   right by because they know it's always junk.
[01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:38.700]   And they then get to the text and start reading down.
[01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:42.380]   And so the ad that gets the most exposure is the ad that's in the middle of the text
[01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:46.540]   of a long story, not a slideshow business insider.
[01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:49.460]   Hey, Reagan, those slides shows.
[01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:50.460]   Yeah.
[01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:51.460]   Don't look too slow.
[01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:55.300]   And down here and an ad even at the bottom, if you've gotten there and read it and been
[01:04:55.300 --> 01:05:00.980]   engaged in the story is more valuable than they had at the top.
[01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:03.620]   Because it's at the point where you want to know what to do next.
[01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:04.620]   Yes.
[01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:07.060]   So what you've got with these sites, these sites now have this.
[01:05:07.060 --> 01:05:09.620]   Now you've finished reading that article, which of these six things you want to go to?
[01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:12.140]   And there's a services that inject those in there.
[01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:15.700]   Well, and that's, that's fairly yucky stuff often.
[01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:18.060]   I regret clicking on those links usually.
[01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:19.060]   Yes.
[01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:20.780]   With the outside, the outbrain stuff.
[01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:24.580]   The outbrain stuff particularly because it's like, go to this, go to this click bait link.
[01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:28.860]   The ones that are actually more stories from the same site are actually, if those are
[01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:30.620]   done sensibly or often very useful.
[01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:34.340]   Yeah, the outbrain stuff is like, oh, God, did I really mean to click on that?
[01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:36.260]   I'm so sorry.
[01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:41.620]   I just met a fascinating company called Mythum Today, an impact called Infinite Analytics,
[01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:43.820]   recommended to be by Tim Berners Lee.
[01:05:43.820 --> 01:05:47.540]   You know, if he'd said, listen, I found an olive oil company I'll talk to.
[01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:48.700]   I talked to them.
[01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:50.700]   Yeah, right.
[01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:55.740]   And so very smart guys where they're looking at your social activity to use that as the
[01:05:55.740 --> 01:05:59.060]   basis for making recommendations to you in smart ways.
[01:05:59.060 --> 01:06:02.500]   Recommendations and relevance are great.
[01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:09.700]   But you know, the outbrain, upworthy, which we talked about last week, obviously Buzzfeed,
[01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:15.140]   the cynicism of them all, the click bait cynicism is just really gotten disgusting and depressing
[01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:16.140]   and fiery.
[01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:20.180]   You know, it's also bad because it incents people to use ad blockers and that kind of
[01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:25.420]   technology just as you know, punch the monkey ads did the same thing.
[01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:27.300]   And that's really bad for everybody.
[01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:33.420]   It's bad for people who rely on advertising for revenue because you know, if you're obnoxious
[01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:37.620]   enough and you piss people off enough, then people will end around it and then nobody
[01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:39.180]   gets paid.
[01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:45.020]   And that means a lot of journals and blogs and services won't no longer monetize and
[01:06:45.020 --> 01:06:46.380]   then they're gone.
[01:06:46.380 --> 01:06:47.380]   Yeah.
[01:06:47.380 --> 01:06:48.940]   Hey, thanks to Linton in our chatroom.
[01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:54.260]   Linton looked at the SEC documents for Intel and that's that's the best.
[01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:58.860]   He looked at the 10Q and said that HP is 18% of Intel's revenue.
[01:06:58.860 --> 01:07:02.700]   Dell 14% Lenovo 11% lots more than the five.
[01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:06.260]   They are still stuck in the PC world.
[01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:07.260]   Yes.
[01:07:07.260 --> 01:07:10.100]   Yeah, because no tablet uses an Intel chip or very few.
[01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:11.540]   Oh, scale over to us.
[01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:13.900]   Well, the big old services do, don't they?
[01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:17.100]   The which say the surface is do the biggest surface does.
[01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:18.100]   Yes.
[01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:20.580]   And of course, that's a laptop by any other name.
[01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:23.100]   A laptop with an attachable keyboard is still a laptop.
[01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:26.100]   And these companies, especially HP make a lot of servers.
[01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:27.100]   Yeah.
[01:07:27.100 --> 01:07:28.100]   Yeah.
[01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:29.100]   Yeah.

[01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:41.420]   My.
[01:07:41.420 --> 01:07:43.100]   Moto X, which I can talk to.
[01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:45.820]   I say, okay, Google, let's go.
[01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:46.820]   Caroling.

[01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:54.540]   Will it work?
[01:07:54.540 --> 01:07:55.540]   It's searching.
[01:07:55.540 --> 01:07:58.100]   It takes a while sometimes.
[01:07:58.100 --> 01:07:59.100]   No.
[01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:00.100]   Okay.
[01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:01.100]   Well, here's what we got.
[01:08:01.100 --> 01:08:02.100]   Wait a minute.
[01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:03.100]   No, no, wait a minute.
[01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:04.100]   No, no, no, no, wait.
[01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:05.100]   It says, which carol would you like to say?
[01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:06.100]   There you go.
[01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:07.100]   That's what you want.
[01:08:07.100 --> 01:08:08.100]   Yep.
[01:08:08.100 --> 01:08:09.100]   Okay.
[01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:10.100]   So, so which would you like?
[01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:11.100]   Jingle Bells up on the house top deck, the halls, oh, Christmas tree.
[01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:12.100]   Oh, there's one that's out of copyright.
[01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:13.100]   Yeah.
[01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:14.100]   Yeah.
[01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:15.100]   Which one's out of copyright?
[01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:16.100]   Oh, here we go.
[01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:17.100]   Cariote.
[01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:18.100]   Ready?
[01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:19.100]   Everybody now.
[01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:20.100]   Oh, Christmas tree.
[01:08:20.100 --> 01:08:21.100]   Oh, Christmas tree.
[01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:24.100]   That leaves us all on.
[01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:26.100]   In German, Jeff.
[01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:36.060]   That is just a weirdest Google search ever.
[01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:39.100]   And I want to know why they didn't do that for Ramadan.
[01:08:39.100 --> 01:08:41.100]   Or, Hanukkah.
[01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:43.100]   Where's your Dratle song?
[01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:45.100]   Yeah, because they don't like Christmas carols.
[01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:46.100]   That's right.
[01:08:46.100 --> 01:08:50.620]   If anybody thinks this is pro-Christian, they don't think they're coming.
[01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:53.860]   So if you say, okay, Google now, let's go carol.
[01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:54.860]   Let's go caroling.
[01:08:54.860 --> 01:08:56.620]   It'll do that for you.
[01:08:56.620 --> 01:09:01.020]   They should have a Ramadan Google app that watches you and make sure you don't eat during
[01:09:01.020 --> 01:09:02.020]   the day.
[01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:03.020]   Yeah.
[01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:04.020]   Yeah.
[01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:05.020]   Stop eating.
[01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:06.020]   Yes.
[01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:07.020]   You're eating.
[01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:08.020]   Put down that cheeseburger.
[01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:09.020]   Ramadan.
[01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:10.020]   I'm sorry.
[01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:11.020]   We should have the cookies.
[01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:12.020]   We should have the cookies.
[01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:13.020]   We should have the cookies.
[01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:15.320]   dark cartoon a mom and then
[01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:19.480]   uh... google is reading its own smart thermostat just like
[01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:21.240]   nest
[01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:23.440]   this is of course more signals
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:26.660]   how how how how hot is your house
[01:09:26.660 --> 01:09:27.560]   uh...
[01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:30.620]   this is from the information Jessica lessons new blog
[01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:33.680]   i i paid for so i can report on it
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:37.840]   the uh... it's called energy sense googles collecting volunteers to check test
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:39.180]   them
[01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:40.840]   uh... an
[01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:44.440]   paralea is a did power meter before which was
[01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:46.720]   a uh... web dashboard
[01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:50.960]   so i remember power me actually does does the chat room no where
[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:56.520]   google is finding these volunteers where do you go sign up how can we sign up yeah
[01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:59.120]   anybody chattor again what's in
[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:02.240]   what is the sound what's in makes when it's a thinking
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:03.240]   thinking
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:04.920]   working
[01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:07.000]   you i've seen ads now i'd be doing ads
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:10.560]   what's it was helping the n_s_a_ for a while now at now uh... they've got ads for
[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:12.960]   what what other stuff what's doing
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:15.040]   is it is what's in one thing or is it a
[01:10:15.040 --> 01:10:20.800]   platform what is what is what's in is it's kind of what's seems very busy
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:22.680]   student a lot of research
[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:25.600]   it's a it's a talk it is basically a is a toolkit
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:28.120]   can run it on different computers
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:29.320]   i would like to see
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:33.400]   is a hoodie based framework that that tries to man work out what's going on
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:35.960]   what's in his hoodoo
[01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:39.200]   well i know how to do
[01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:43.660]   i'd like to see what's in combined with one of these new google boston dynamics
[01:10:43.660 --> 01:10:44.600]   robots
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:47.800]   where what's in has to actually hit the button
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:49.040]   in jeopardy
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:52.200]   and i don't think that's that i don't think what's in would do as well as it
[01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:55.080]   had to compete for speed for that's right
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:58.960]   that's right on it i want to re-match is he those poor schmuck's with the button
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:00.840]   like crazy and never get it
[01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:05.680]   so apparently the google play store has some apps these are called energy sense
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:07.120]   apps
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:09.160]   that uh...
[01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:13.360]   sense energy efficiency create awareness among users and raise events
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:16.440]   these are not from google but they are in the app store
[01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:21.760]   uh... i'm not sure if this is related to what google is up to
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:23.600]   but uh...
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:29.360]   amira friday writing for the uh... information uh... refers to them
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:33.880]   i think i think this thermostat is just a tip of the iceberg for a larger push by
[01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:37.880]   google and lots of companies into both home home automation and the internet of
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:38.960]   things
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:43.920]   where it's not just thermostats and and and nest for example has this incredible
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:45.800]   credibly great actually
[01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:48.220]   smoke detectors by i took my nests out
[01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:49.200]   yeah did you
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:50.200]   yeah
[01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:53.800]   yet kept turning on the heat
[01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:56.160]   you know sometimes smart things are not
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:59.400]   there's a right i just want to dumb thermostat when it's cold i turn the heat
[01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:00.640]   on
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:02.680]   i don't need to save you any money
[01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:06.960]   it says it save me money but i have a wino
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:09.160]   it's smarter than me
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:11.840]   yeah i didn't put it in the new house but the you know what you know where the
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:14.720]   uh... you know where the camels knows that of the tennis is my uh...
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:16.640]   microsoft xbox one yeah
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:20.480]   which really can is pretty damn smart guy talk to it and
[01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:23.360]   i wouldn't you know the key of the thing that's missing
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:25.720]   uh... is the connection
[01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:29.280]   there's no standard for how these things talk to one's right that's right and
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:32.920]   there's a the home automation market is an enormous market very fraction everything
[01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:36.120]   is moving right there's the there's the big like the big bein
[01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:39.000]   like companies have to come install it for you or you have to be a right at
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.440]   home automation genius or you gotta buy those five you know there's expensive
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:46.120]   plugs exactly every damn appliance right and then there's the smartphone
[01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:50.160]   controlled world which on kickstarter is just an amazing thriving we should do
[01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:51.680]   a show we are going to do a home
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:53.680]   automatically yes yes
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:55.080]   you choose yes
[01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:57.000]   you can use my house as an example
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:01.400]   there you can have a nice and will show me locked out in the middle of the
[01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:06.360]   night it's raining and i can house open house open
[01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:08.480]   house open
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:11.440]   that's the problem everybody was any experience of these things that was that
[01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:14.520]   you know even the hue lights which i like a lot the idea of the controlling
[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:15.960]   lights via wifi
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:19.360]   have a little flaw with the power goes out they turn on full bright as soon as
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:21.120]   it comes back in the middle of the night
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:23.080]   i wake up in the lights are on
[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:28.200]   and i was and i it's like what it's like suddenly blaring bright my better
[01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:31.480]   and i'm reaching for my phone trying to find the he who have to turn off the
[01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:32.060]   lights
[01:13:32.060 --> 01:13:36.600]   the least has a good sense just to flip the switch
[01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:38.080]   all
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:40.520]   didn't think of that
[01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:46.080]   zigby uh... is he uses zigby z_i_g_ b double e
[01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:49.600]   uh... and there are a lot of things that do zigby but there's other standards
[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:53.000]   to and it doesn't seem like there's any standard for any of this
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.240]   and i have the feeling that i'd be can apples i'd be can they're indoor so
[01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:59.360]   out here i think that's going to be a home automation
[01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:03.800]   play eventually because every apple device uh... of a certain vintages
[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:07.240]   and i'd be can transmitter and so you can walk around the house and all know
[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:10.480]   where you are so goes for sure doing this because they've got the speech
[01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:11.200]   recognition
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:13.680]   but also remember when they were showing the queue
[01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:18.440]   at that uh... google i_o_ and they showed you waving your cd over it
[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:20.680]   and they would know all the songs you had there was
[01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:23.920]   right it seems like google's got a lot of the pieces of this puzzle the other
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:28.400]   signals you have to have a friend of mine who's a professor v_e_ of rutgers
[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:31.280]   talks about how every appliance this is well-known
[01:14:31.280 --> 01:14:33.640]   a reply and says signature
[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:37.320]   so looking at your power pattern you can see what appliances are on for how
[01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:38.800]   long what time of the day
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:41.920]   right now that's already that's already data that's there and available for the
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:44.720]   grabbing
[01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:46.880]   it's a it's an incredible i really think
[01:14:46.880 --> 01:14:50.240]   we should do a show on that that i want to do a little talk let's talk about
[01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:53.720]   how much fun i think i was a little bit of a
[01:14:53.720 --> 01:14:55.040]   world's fair
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:56.920]   hahahaha
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:00.160]   someday all your phone calls will be video calls
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:04.120]   chromecast gets smarter in fact it may get ultimately get completely open right
[01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:05.760]   now googles the gatekeeper
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:08.600]   uh... we mentioned last week all the new apps now the latest word is that there
[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:11.600]   will be an s_d_k_ early next year that will allow anybody who wants to grow
[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:12.400]   an able
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:17.880]   crumbcast enable an app to do so without googles permission so stand back
[01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:20.760]   as i was that was the because i played with the old s_d_k_ in the problem was you
[01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:21.800]   had to
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:25.040]   if the press was very come to the rescue app google
[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:28.880]   uh... and then you have to do some degree pokary to the each crumbcast you
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:30.160]   wanted to play on
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:32.040]   to authorize that app as well
[01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:37.320]   and so to actually get it working was was was quite annoying and made it
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:40.280]   not worth doing to distribute anything because you should agree pokary was the
[01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:41.720]   dance they were doing as fizzy wigs
[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:47.560]   and i've heard it stops or there will be a few people
[01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:50.720]   it's dispelled jiggery pokary
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:54.480]   is this this is obviously when i get from going to the london for a week from
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:58.600]   my public schools that's the public schools it's all it is and that's an it's
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:01.400]   and that's in indian is a minute jiggery pokary
[01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:05.720]   yeah that's that that seems to be pokary then it makes sense
[01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:08.400]   uh... you've said you have you had to like
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:12.120]   register a thing with google that would take a day and you have to register
[01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:16.080]   a domain and a u_r_l_ with them to for you to put your page on
[01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:17.800]   and then you have to
[01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:21.400]   do some complicated thing where you log into each crumbcast and bless that
[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:22.760]   europeas well
[01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:26.840]   to bless it on the service of the club is on the client side to play back
[01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:30.680]   but then then you could write and crumbcast stuff
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:33.480]   uh... having a little s_k_ will be a would be a big win for that i think
[01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:35.920]   because i think it's a bit it's very you know
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:39.680]   the actual idea is it is actually very well thought out it is basically it's
[01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:41.120]   running a web browser
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:44.360]   you send it a web page and then there's a protocol for you to talk back and
[01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:47.280]   forth from the device you're holding to the web page
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:50.320]   this being displayed on the crime cost is dial right this is this is an open
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:52.200]   standard dial
[01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:53.160]   uh...
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:56.080]   it's kind of it's got some of a little stuff that there's on it as well yes
[01:16:56.080 --> 01:16:58.840]   discovery and launch
[01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:02.000]   but also and you know they've they've they've they were using bit
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.080]   bits of web rt c in it
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:06.720]   but also they had their own wrap around that as well so if they're smart they'll
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:07.840]   make it more
[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:10.960]   uh... you know to just use the web i_d_c_ stuff as that gets more mature and
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:12.280]   use that directly
[01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:14.720]   but part of the part of the family of it was that
[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:15.960]   and said that that
[01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:18.000]   use case i was using it for was
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.720]   uh... i had a web slideshow
[01:17:20.720 --> 01:17:22.080]   uh... you know presentation
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:24.980]   app and i was used sending that to the uh...
[01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:27.240]   crumbcast so i can advance the slides from
[01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:28.960]   from the the phone or whatever
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:30.480]   so you can
[01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:32.480]   get get around that that whole issue
[01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:33.480]   and then
[01:17:33.480 --> 01:17:36.160]   in rather so rather than send saying
[01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:39.320]   clone my screen from whatever i'm holding to this thing
[01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:42.760]   you can say go to this page and let me manipulate that page from the thing i'm
[01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:43.480]   holding
[01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:46.200]   which i think is is actually more useful than the
[01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:48.440]   uh... the broadcast your screen what
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:52.680]   that a little bit harder to understand
[01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:57.640]   uh... google give it a google take it away the gallery app the stock gallery
[01:17:57.640 --> 01:17:59.440]   app is no longer
[01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:02.200]   uh... play edition devices
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:03.840]   good written up
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:07.440]   good read well what is that what i think that is that is this stuff
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:11.360]   so photos is the replacement of photos is more like a google plus interface
[01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:14.840]   exactly but it is confusing because on my on many of my phones i have photos
[01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:16.200]   in gallery
[01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:19.440]   and then of course if you have a samsung or h_c_ you have your own gallery the
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:21.400]   a_s_a_s_ p gallery
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:22.720]   and photos
[01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:24.920]   uh... so galleries the odd man out
[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:28.680]   uh... however the find my i phone uh... or find my
[01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:31.200]   pieces like for my i find for my android phone
[01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:34.920]   uh... device manager is now available in the place or you can start any uh...
[01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:36.720]   and right device
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:37.600]   uh...
[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:39.520]   i can say i i don't do the work like this
[01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:44.000]   okay google now find my phone
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:47.320]   the idea being that you would uh... you do that and you would walk around the
[01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:48.640]   house saying that
[01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:51.560]   looking like an idiot all the cats looking at you
[01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:53.520]   going what is he saying and then
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:55.560]   well when it when it triggers
[01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:58.960]   up to see it heard all the other stuff i said but not find my phone
[01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:02.800]   find my phone
[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:05.760]   and it makes us really loud annoying
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:08.240]   great but it didn't
[01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:09.840]   so you have your phone
[01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:13.000]   your phone can't i know the one time i left my phone
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:16.040]   in a place where this would actually work in a seat cushion in my sofa it
[01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:17.800]   didn't work so
[01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:20.640]   well they've had that thing that i've had the android device manager this you
[01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:23.880]   do that is just a bit of a skill to find right right you can use that now to
[01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:26.280]   make them chirp and jump up and down
[01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:27.680]   and
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:30.480]   in and here they tell you where they are and they will be to make the make
[01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:31.960]   noises so you can find them too
[01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:34.720]   and also show you a map of where your phone
[01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:37.160]   all of these are all of course i didn't set up my
[01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:39.400]   next seven got stolen for you
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:41.400]   what
[01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:43.200]   you're you're not working
[01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:45.560]   for eyes and other one
[01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:49.560]   uh... now has four four haven't heard any of the rise and rise and by the way
[01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:52.960]   meanwhile is looking at the delay the cell it's only open spectrum the lt
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:56.240]   spectrum of dot because it can't bear to be open
[01:19:56.240 --> 01:19:59.920]   so that it gets them off the hook they don't have to adhere to the office of
[01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:04.640]   the fcc they've been still violated my rights by agent
[01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:08.240]   they should be grandfathered in
[01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:11.920]   a my glass companion after google vise briefly appeared
[01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:14.640]   in the app store for i_o_s_
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:17.360]   and android realized what it i mean apple realize what it was in the
[01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:18.840]   acted i don't know what happened to it
[01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:20.320]   weird
[01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:24.680]   google says that my glass will return to the app store later this week
[01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:27.880]   uh... it's going to go inside with the latest monthly updates of the finally
[01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:30.240]   you'll be able to use you've had to use it with an android device right
[01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:33.440]   yet you'll now be able to use it with i_o_s_
[01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:35.760]   aren't you lucky is going to be nice
[01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:37.640]   going to be nice
[01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:38.640]   uh...
[01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:40.520]   google
[01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:43.920]   uh... now shows images in your google mail
[01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:46.360]   if you were here this would all be change log stuff but i'm just gonna kind
[01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:47.680]   of roll it all up
[01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:52.080]   uh... but don't worry they're safe because it's proxying those images or
[01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:55.880]   there was so much confusion about this this week uh... wired thought that this
[01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:59.120]   meant that every advertiser could read you could see where you are when in fact
[01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:03.240]   it was the opposite of the city's people's cash in the images right
[01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:05.160]   that was a strange article
[01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:07.880]   misunderstanding that was right
[01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:11.880]   so i'll tell you what's going on here in my humble opinion
[01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:16.080]   so up to now uh... if you use gmail there would be a button that said load
[01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:19.040]   images from the center you can say always load images from the center
[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:21.800]   but by default they would just be a box with an accident
[01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:24.720]   that probably confused people so one argument the google could make is
[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:27.560]   hey we're gonna it's not going to confuse people anymore
[01:21:27.560 --> 01:21:30.920]   of the c images but we've sanitized them so what happens is google
[01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:34.360]   reencodes them to remove any potential uh... malware
[01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:37.200]   but it also uh... proxies them so
[01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:40.560]   the loading of those images no longer notifies the center that you're looking
[01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:43.400]   at the email or gives that center information about you
[01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:46.280]   however i asked all i've also have to point out
[01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:50.040]   it means that news letters and other kind of junk email that you get with
[01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:50.880]   images and i
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:53.320]   is much more valuable to people sending it
[01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:55.920]   uh... in the sense that you're going to see the images now
[01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:57.680]   you can turn this off
[01:21:57.680 --> 01:21:59.080]   in the settings
[01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:02.360]   uh... but if you all the sudden i i don't i don't want to see those images and
[01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:04.600]   there is the security risk that's gone
[01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:06.440]   but there is also the issue of
[01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:09.760]   i think googles probably doing this 'cause
[01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:12.840]   you know people who sent email newsletters were complaining right
[01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:16.240]   and and they also like features that they can do that a lot of other companies
[01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:20.960]   can do who can cash a lot of data gazillions of photographs uh... like that
[01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:23.960]   but people you know i think it's kind of i think it's a good move because the
[01:22:23.960 --> 01:22:27.800]   vast majority of gmail users probably didn't know
[01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:31.000]   that the existence of pictures in email can show
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:35.200]   the sender your IP address uh... they can find out all kinds of other information
[01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:36.120]   about you
[01:22:36.120 --> 01:22:39.760]   i i'm just like you're loading their web page exactly exactly and i i'm not
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:41.280]   clear weather
[01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:44.520]   you know if this thing if it's still possible for the center to find out
[01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:48.280]   when you open i think it is their banana tag type i read something that it is
[01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:51.680]   it is the case that they still can there is a way to do that so the proxy
[01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:54.520]   several fetching so you see the first time you see the proxy server get it
[01:22:54.520 --> 01:22:57.680]   as you said so google will know you see google do it
[01:22:57.680 --> 01:23:01.280]   but i think it is not on your behalf just on behalf of everybody who gets that
[01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:04.280]   no because the point is you put us you need your offer each set each one you
[01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:06.880]   said uh... clever which is the classic way you do
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:09.800]   and you know right and you said an image with the your offer each or even
[01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:13.440]   not an image of one by one pixel
[01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:17.360]   now people should think is that they uh... when they read the images
[01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:19.160]   they just cash them as is
[01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:22.320]   they pass them re-write the re-encoder
[01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:24.520]   to make sure they're not they're not malicious so they can protect them out
[01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:25.460]   where ones
[01:23:25.460 --> 01:23:28.280]   and replace them with stuff doesn't offer over runs and things like that
[01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:30.800]   they can replace the ones that that fail on their
[01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:33.640]   you know their sandbox and gift bars or whatever
[01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:37.120]   and with one that is next so that you he doesn't like crash lots of machines
[01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:40.160]   just crushes one but they've been doing that for a while as part of the the
[01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:41.920]   google rule architecture
[01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:45.600]   so one one criticism of this is that google is in the advertising business
[01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:48.680]   and they're not in the email marketing business
[01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:51.720]   and this is uh... seen as a move against email marketing
[01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:56.600]   uh... and and therefore against a competitive type of advertising
[01:23:56.600 --> 01:24:00.240]   um... everyone should know that that's part of the controversy here and and
[01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:03.640]   people should also know that this won't hit mobile devices until sometime next
[01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:04.520]   year
[01:24:04.520 --> 01:24:07.800]   uh... i believe it's already been enabled on desktop
[01:24:07.800 --> 01:24:08.960]   universally
[01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:11.520]   but not on mobile to next to us or on the st
[01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:12.520]   mobile
[01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:15.520]   so mail chimp says this is better for them
[01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:16.520]   uh...
[01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:17.880]   because
[01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:21.760]   when images are turned off effectively google hides
[01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:24.680]   everything a bit of information so they're getting more information than they
[01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:26.840]   were not only information they'd like
[01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:30.760]   or that they get if you use apples male client might might be left at this
[01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:32.760]   point is that marketers get
[01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:34.000]   uh...
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.400]   less
[01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:37.560]   information about each user
[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:41.720]   more information from more users so they know when everybody opens it for
[01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:43.400]   example instead of before
[01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:45.680]   bunch of people opened it and they don't know
[01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:49.600]   if the non-opners we never saw it or whether they never turned on the picture
[01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:51.120]   or whatever so
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:54.680]   now there's more clarity at least about a smaller set of data
[01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:58.800]   and youtubers changes copyright policy so that every single video we've ever
[01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:01.520]   put up there is now uh... blocked
[01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:03.400]   thank you you
[01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:08.120]   not as bad as that but we did very much increase the number of copyright uh...
[01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:10.280]   emails we got we've got a number of uh...
[01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:12.120]   videos that are now blocked
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:14.480]   permanently
[01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:19.160]   uh... the company at google i guess has changed how the automatic content i_d_
[01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:21.400]   uh... works in fact in some cases
[01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:25.240]   uh... companies have blocked themselves
[01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:29.560]   it's really hammering the you know people do game reviews by showing a game
[01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:33.280]   and and the game companies don't want
[01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:36.760]   videos blocked these through fantastic marketing for them so it's you know who
[01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:38.840]   are they helping here with this
[01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:42.320]   well it's this is all the content is into the game ones was it the person who
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:45.120]   composed the background is in the game
[01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:50.440]   is then causing content i_d_ claim against people showing the game
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:54.280]   well i i've just seen lots more take downs and i think there's a lot of
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:55.840]   fraudulent takedowns
[01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:59.840]   the fact that this what that a company was able to block itself shows us
[01:25:59.840 --> 01:26:03.080]   that the content i_d_ system does nothing to validate any content claim
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:03.640]   right
[01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:08.400]   so it's just a stupid system and it just to me my reaction to it is this is why
[01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:11.960]   i don't count on google as a platform it's not a good platform for serious
[01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:13.600]   content creators is
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:15.680]   still the crotch shot channel
[01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:17.120]   and uh...
[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:20.480]   and uh... really i mean google if you want to get serious about content this is
[01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:22.280]   not how you do it
[01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:25.800]   that you're right you mean i'm a serious content creator and
[01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:29.720]   we cannot count on any video staying up on google period
[01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:31.360]   ever
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:34.200]   and i can imagine we're the only ones
[01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:35.960]   or let's take a break when we come back

[01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:24.640]   off less
[01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:29.080]   um... slightly something the university does to try to not so
[01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:33.360]   it's hard to get rid of a tenured professor these days
[01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:34.720]   you
[01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:39.160]   do you have a tip you would like to give us uh... mr kevin marks
[01:34:39.160 --> 01:34:40.480]   um...
[01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:42.680]   i'd not sure i have a tip
[01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:46.160]   um... anything you'd like to talk about it so it's so i've
[01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:50.960]   the thing that the amused me this week was was dogecoin if you've seen that
[01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:54.560]   is that is that is this related to bitcoin
[01:34:54.560 --> 01:34:58.040]   this is the new krypto currency based on
[01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:01.680]   the internet meme doge
[01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:06.960]   what does the mayor of venice doge no does that the dog that says stupid
[01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:09.360]   things in income in coming since
[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:10.320]   uh...
[01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:14.960]   i don't know that doge don't know that mean i am so out of it
[01:35:14.960 --> 01:35:19.480]   you're two means behind i'm two means behind the cute dog and it says you know
[01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:22.320]   much currency and and has this little you know like
[01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:25.980]   you don't with saying nonsense thing is it's the success of all cuts as
[01:35:25.980 --> 01:35:29.480]   but there's no doge coins as someone has actually made a cryptocurrency based on
[01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:30.520]   on this
[01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:31.920]   there's a doge
[01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:34.080]   uh...
[01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:35.520]   so is doge like
[01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:38.520]   the the cat that's that says things funny
[01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:41.600]   yes it's like it's like a lot of things but is it the different is the dog response
[01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:45.560]   to the funny cat different idiom it's a cute dog that has a shebo is a sheba
[01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:46.600]   inu
[01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:47.000]   yes
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.600]   uh... you know you know you're me as your friend here
[01:35:49.600 --> 01:35:50.600]   um... yeah
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:54.920]   so it's been a it's been an interesting week for cryptocurrencies because bit
[01:35:54.920 --> 01:35:57.640]   coin had a crash yesterday again
[01:35:57.640 --> 01:35:59.240]   is that the five hundred thousand
[01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:01.760]   shot down is all kinds of stuff going like that
[01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:02.240]   uh...
[01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:06.280]   but also someone or stosh coin and you can mind those coins and
[01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:09.720]   uh... i've got ten doesch coins because i was i was messing around with that so
[01:36:09.720 --> 01:36:10.640]   that's
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:12.760]   and somebody those doge coins will be
[01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:14.240]   worth nothing
[01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:16.960]   i think that's actually have an exchange i think someone's got an exchange rate for
[01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:20.440]   them to bitcoin which is like a really we're mining doge coins here at
[01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:21.560]   twit
[01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:25.840]   the engineering department is decided to mind them with our spare cycles on
[01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:27.720]   our encoding machines
[01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:29.280]   uh...
[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:33.040]   well i mean i i i i i was playing with this because it
[01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:35.240]   the point is that this is this is
[01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:37.960]   light bitcoin was three years ago you can actually mind it on your own machine and
[01:36:37.960 --> 01:36:39.280]   see something happen
[01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:42.600]   but is it a bit kind of serious or is it a joke
[01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:46.760]   it's both it's a it's a joke that but it's a joke it's a fork of light coin it's
[01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:50.400]   based on the script staff it's all it's like it is like coins uh... technology
[01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:53.760]   yeah uh... interesting it's just called doge coin is got a different pool and
[01:36:53.760 --> 01:36:57.400]   different are we actually mining doge coin
[01:36:57.400 --> 01:36:59.920]   uh...
[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:00.960]   so this is this is like
[01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:04.640]   you know the the cryptos thing i mean the other the other ones this week was
[01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:07.200]   in that area was was coin base
[01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:08.840]   which is uh...
[01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:10.440]   they got venture funding for
[01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:14.000]   uh... for being a bit coin exchange that no people can use
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:16.480]   and so i thought i would give that a try it is basically
[01:37:16.480 --> 01:37:19.880]   instead of being like you said it like using p_g_p_ it's now like using
[01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:23.240]   e-trade so you have to still have to do lots of feeling about to configure
[01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:24.120]   things
[01:37:24.120 --> 01:37:26.680]   but then you can buy bitcoins and then they'll deliver them to you like
[01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:29.240]   several days later just like each rate does the stocks
[01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:32.600]   so that they're they're trying hard to be
[01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:34.360]   the e-trade of bitcoins
[01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:36.680]   which makes it a certain amount of sense things is people basically use
[01:37:36.680 --> 01:37:37.880]   them to speculate with
[01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:41.160]   is just that's this is nuts
[01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:42.960]   talking dog
[01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:46.040]   and i'm not going to not currency
[01:37:46.040 --> 01:37:48.480]   it was always his idea
[01:37:48.480 --> 01:37:51.880]   do you have anything you'd like to tell us about my idea i have a combination
[01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:52.920]   tip
[01:37:52.920 --> 01:37:54.200]   and pick
[01:37:54.200 --> 01:37:56.720]   and you don't recall the
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:38:00.840]   secret launch that didn't take place at google for the moto acts that which
[01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:03.680]   didn't happen and you weren't there i wasn't there you weren't there none of us
[01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:05.800]   was there and what they announced that this non-existent
[01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:09.560]   and we can get bamboo that's exactly the pick and tip
[01:38:09.560 --> 01:38:13.240]   now they told us or they did they didn't tell us they showed us
[01:38:13.240 --> 01:38:15.600]   uh... i kawasaki had a wooden back
[01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:20.280]   but but they said that they were going to have an unconditional return and
[01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:21.800]   replace policy right
[01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:24.880]   they said if you order a yellow phone and you don't like yellow
[01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:28.280]   then send it back will get sent you whatever color so can i send my moto
[01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:32.880]   expect and get them that that is a question if you have a hundred bucks
[01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:36.360]   i thought there was a two-week limit uh... i don't know what the limit is if it is
[01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:40.280]   now it is now it says within within i think fourteen days so i think that's
[01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:43.600]   they they backed down on that as the statute of limitations
[01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:46.600]   but if you've ordered one hundred bucks to get wood
[01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:51.080]   i would because look at it's beautiful but it's white on the front you can only
[01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:54.600]   get a white front and it's only bamboo they originally show that he can all
[01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:55.600]   kids and things
[01:38:55.600 --> 01:38:58.960]   but uh... it's only bamboo bamboo is probably the best wood for this year
[01:38:58.960 --> 01:39:00.480]   it's flexible it's yeah
[01:39:00.480 --> 01:39:02.600]   uh... it's also used a cutting board
[01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:05.640]   uh... it's anti-bacterial right
[01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:07.960]   uh... but i'm just curious for
[01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:10.960]   okay so there's a two-week thing for people who've ordered a moto acts for
[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:14.280]   the last two weeks and want a bamboo and you have a hundred bucks want to spend
[01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:15.120]   on it
[01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:18.040]   send it back and tell them you want the bamboo one and see if they'll do it if
[01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:19.320]   they won't
[01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:22.320]   let us know because they told us that this is going to be an unconditional
[01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:26.400]   policy i want i would be i would pay a hundred bucks to get a bamboo on this
[01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:29.320]   although i finally gave up in order to know three cuz i want to really be
[01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:31.120]   phone
[01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:34.600]   uh... and now you can get a uh... they're back with the uh... writing on the back
[01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:36.280]   you get a signature
[01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:38.920]   yeah they use a branding iron aid
[01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:40.400]   in
[01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:42.880]   california

[01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:03.840]   thanks is i'm surrounded by nexus fibers
[01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:06.680]   but i just i just had to buy a new nixon seven so i drop mine in the
[01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:09.800]   toilet in england which was a bit of a no
[01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:12.920]   we have a we have a return to that my take the week is don't drop in excess
[01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:14.960]   do not it gets wet
[01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:16.920]   and and i don't remember that commercial
[01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:19.240]   where every punchline is really
[01:40:19.240 --> 01:40:21.760]   the guy who's out of the earl really
[01:40:21.760 --> 01:40:22.600]   really
[01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:26.280]   try to retrieve the nexus seven i know i would you know i retrieved it but
[01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:29.320]   and i tried to try it out but
[01:40:29.320 --> 01:40:31.480]   i was not enough rice in the world yeah
[01:40:31.480 --> 01:40:35.680]   but it was um it was a polish supermarket and what i thought was what was actually
[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:38.600]   a stir disguised as rice
[01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:41.320]   sir no it will not work with spetzle
[01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:43.480]   it will not work with pastina like
[01:40:43.480 --> 01:40:44.880]   looks more like
[01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:46.440]   i sleep
[01:40:46.440 --> 01:40:48.120]   and i was going to virus
[01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:51.080]   it's actually really sad because it rebooted itself and then it died and
[01:40:51.080 --> 01:40:52.200]   it was up again
[01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:54.480]   and then the little light at the bottom came on
[01:40:54.480 --> 01:40:57.680]   and it's like stayed on the faded out over a bit about an hour of a season
[01:40:57.680 --> 01:41:00.760]   i was trying to come back
[01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:05.200]   and he and germany says bamboo is less moist as less humidity
[01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:07.080]   so it's good for the antenna
[01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:10.000]   and of course it's easy to manufacture as tough
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:11.800]   think that was a sustainable
[01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:12.840]   yeah sustainable
[01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:17.040]   god knows you grow bamboo about four minutes sustainable these days
[01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:20.360]   ladies and gentlemen that concludes this week in google kevin kelly's coming up
[01:41:20.360 --> 01:41:22.600]   for triangulation we're gonna talk about as cool tools
