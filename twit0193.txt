[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   >> Hello everybody, this is Twit, episode 193.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   Some great people joining us today to talk about the weeks.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Text stories in a informal and happy-go-lucky fashion,
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   starting with the happy-go-lucky Dwight Silverman from the
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   Houston Chronicle.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   >> Hello.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   >> Is it K-Dwight? Is it kron.com/blog? Is that right?
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   >> It's blogs.kron.com/techblog.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   >> I'm going to change your lower third right now.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   And I just want to let you know that all of the stories
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   we're doing today, I stole from Dwight.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   >> Yay!
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   >> He has a link list.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   >> He has a link list that is -- well, I'd like to include
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   stories that the panelists have already been thinking about
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   and writing about.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   So I also stole stories from Veronica Belmont of
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Texilla High Veronica.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   >> That's not true. You didn't steal any stories from me.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   >> You guys do tech news every day now though, don't you?
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   >> We do want a daily tip show. It's not tech news.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   >> Do you know cover tech news? Yeah, you do a little bit,
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   don't you?
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   >> On the weekly show, usually.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   And then also with us, Harry McCracken of the Technologizer
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   blog. Hi, Harry.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   >> Hey, Leo.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   >> How are you?
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   >> Great. Great to have you back.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   >> Nice to be here.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   >> I was watching -- I was on, I think, the history channel
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   the other day watching a history of computing in the '80s.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   >> They must show that 100 times a week, because I did that
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   five years ago, and everywhere I go, people see that.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   >> It's a good thing.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   >> I've never seen that, but it's the most played thing
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   I ever did by far.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   >> That's really funny.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   They're talking about Atari and stuff.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   And actually, I thought there was something I got out of it,
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   frankly, was they were talking about how Atari, the failure
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   of Atari in the 2600, because it was an open platform.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Atari did what we would today think was the right thing,
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   which was to allow anybody to develop software for the Atari
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   platform.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   And of course, a lot of crap games were developed, and it
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   killed the 2600.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   And I thought, well, that kind of applies a little bit to today
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   to the iPhone.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   I mean, that's what Apple does with the iPhone.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   >> That's actually, Atari 2600 and iPhone is a pretty
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   interesting comparison in a lot of ways.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   >> Well, I mean, it's odd to compare the two, but Apple has
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   an absolutely closed environment.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   And they're doing it for the same reason that Atari didn't do it.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   The same reason that Nintendo, looking at Atari, said, "Oh,
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   we really can't let that happen.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   We better license everything."
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   And as a result, you know, Apple has full control, but they get
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   a lot of heat from people who say it's not an open platform.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   >> Certainly none of the none of today's gaming consoles or
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   anywhere here is open as the early ones were.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   >> No, they learned their lesson.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   >> Ah, they all want to make money selling the games, even if
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   they lose money on the consoles.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   >> Right.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Yeah, you know, some of the, some of the games that started on
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   the Atari 2600 are now starting to show up on the iPhone.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   You've seen crazy a lot of these classic games.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   >> What goes around comes around.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   >> I love that.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   I want to see more Coleco vision games on the iPhone
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   person.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   >> The Adam.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   >> You know what they, you know what they just released?
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   If you're an old Mac person, you'll recognize it.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Mist is available for the iPhone.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   The full, this shows you how much the platform, how powerful
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   the iPhone platform, the full game, hundred-something megabytes.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   >> It's a huge download.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   >> Did you get it already?
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   >> I didn't get it yet, but I saw the story today actually when
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   I was going through the delicious links.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   I said, "Oh my gosh, I got to get that.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   That's so fun."
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   >> That's so cool.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   You must have been pretty little when, when Mist came out.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   >> Yeah, wait, here was it.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   >> I don't know.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   >> You know, 1995 or so, I think, mid-90s.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   >> Oh, okay.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   >> Okay, I was like 13.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   >> It was actually the perfect game for a 13-year-old.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   You know, that was exactly right for a 13-year-old.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   >> That was the golden age of games on CD-ROM.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   >> That's right.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   >> Which lasted about a minute.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   >> Well, and, you know, as a corollary to that, this is the week
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   that in Carta died.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   >> Oh.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   >> Talk about it.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   >> It was sad, actually, because I used that all the time.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   >> That was sad.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   >> I think my kids grew up going through elementary school using
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   in Carta on a CD-ROM as a way to study.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   And so when it went away, it was kind of like sad for all of us.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   >> And it was a great program.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   And if you were to do a list to the top 10 best things Microsoft
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   ever did, I think in Carta would be on that because for the mid-90s,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   it was really well done.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   >> I used it all the time for schoolwork, definitely.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   >> You're making us feel old now.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   >> Sorry.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   >> I reviewed it back then.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   >> I've got that perspective, right?
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   >> I used it for schoolwork.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Yeah, I mean, what did they start with like funk and wagmills?
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   They started with like the worst encyclopedia, the one that they
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   gave away in the grocery store.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   And everybody--
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   >> That was the only one they could license.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   >> They licensed everything.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   >> They wanted to just everything.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   >> They got to go down and--
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   >> They got to go down.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   >> They licensed that and Compton's and a bunch of others,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   and they had it on to it.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   >> They had a great user interface, though, and they were, you know,
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   the multimedia aspect was great.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   Even Wikipedia today does not really do multimedia in the way
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   that Encarta did 15 years ago.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   >> You know, I remember using it a lot like Wikipedia the way I
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   used Wikipedia now, which was going to an article and then
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   continuing to browse through related articles and just spending
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   hours and hours just learning about totally random stuff because
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   it was, you know, relevant to my interests or just, you know,
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   something that was cool to see.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   >> At the time it came out, there was encyclopedic Britannica
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   on CD-ROM, but it cost $1,000.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   It had no artwork of any type.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   >> That was a smart move on their part.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Where are they now?
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   I guess they're where Encarta is.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   It actually didn't really matter.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Nobody needs encyclopedia.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   I have a world book encyclopedia right here,
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   printed world book encyclopedia that I got because I thought
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   the kids would use it.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   No, they never used it.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   They use Wikipedia.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   What happened, you know, the whole CD-ROM thing was a big flop.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   >> Well, not at the time.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   >> Well, I don't know.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Was it?
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Do I?
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   I mean, yeah, I mean, we bought, particularly for kids, and
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   obviously, you know, a lot of games came on.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   A lot of the early games, you know, shooters and popular PC
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   games would not run unless the disc was in.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   So I guess that counts as a CD-ROM.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   But particularly for kids, a lot of educational software and so
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   forth.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   >> Well, that's what I'm thinking of.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   >> I'm thinking of like, oh, I remember there were tours of
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   museums.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   There were games like Myst.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   There was Encarta.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   I mean, some of those, I remember reading later that some of
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   those titles sold dozens of copies.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   I mean, they put millions of dollars into production and
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   they just nobody would buy them.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   The internet completely superseded and it happened within
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   a few.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   I mean, look, it was '95.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   >> Yeah, I mean, the CD-ROM thing started about 1993 maybe by
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   '95 that Webb was taking off.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   And so 680 megabytes or whatever a CD-ROM held went from
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   being a huge amount of data to being nothing.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   >> Yeah, it's pretty amazing.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   >> I remember going to Staples.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Go ahead.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   >> Say again, the Webb was generally free and CD-ROMs cost
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   money.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   What were you saying Veronica?
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   >> I was saying how I used to go to Staples and they would have
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   these bargain bins just full of CD-ROM educational titles and
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   games and you could pick up a whole arm load for like, you know,
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   50 bucks.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   >> But education, the educational market just died.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   I mean, that I feel sad about.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   My kids did the Broderbund living books.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   Remember those?
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   Did your kids do those Dwight?
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   The living books series?
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   >> Yes.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   >> Yeah, they loved it.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   >> They were great and they're gone.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   It was one generation got those and now they're gone and I don't
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   know why that is.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   >> That would be a perfect addition for the iPhone.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   If whoever holds the rights is listening, hey,
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   let's make a great iPhone out.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   >> It's pretty funny that you could get all of missed.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   Now on my phone and the graphics are good.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   I mean, it looks pretty much, you know, it looks just the same.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   >> Did you download it already?
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Did you get it?
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   >> No, no, I was going to wait a little after the show.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   I don't want to kill my bandwidth.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   >> It's like a hundred, what is it?
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   A hundred 43 megabytes something like that.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   >> How much does it cost?
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   >> 599.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   >> It's not expensive.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   >> And what the original one was like $39.95 or something on CD-ROM.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   >> Yeah, I just think that's kind of a neat story.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   >> You know, Dvorak is not on and here we are already going down memory lane.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   >> Yeah, yeah.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   What's wrong with us?
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   We all got the old guy on and we're still doing it.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   All right, let's talk about the present.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   Disney buys into, this was a very interesting story, 30% some say of Hulu
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   and Disney's put all of the ABC shows on there, lost, I mean, just a ton of
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   shows on there.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   I mean, this is a huge victory for Hulu.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   This is a real proof that Hulu is the future of television, don't you think?
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   Why did ABC see this as something they wanted to be part of?
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   >> Well, I think it was probably in the works before this, but this was also about
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   the same time that there was a report that Hulu had a huge increase in traffic.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   And I know that almost everybody I know has at least sampled Hulu.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   I hear from a lot of readers who started asking about Boxy even though they don't
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   have a Mac or Linux.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   Boxy being the kind of the interface that can sit on top of the Mac or Linux
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   or Apple TV and make it easier to look at Internet video and Hulu,
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   they keep trying to block them and they keep coming through.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   >> Yeah, Boxy.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   >> I think there's just a lot more buzz and people are kind of getting the idea
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   of doing it over the web.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   And the commercial has commercials just like regular television,
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   but they're not as intrusive and they're not as long.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   >> Do you watch, are you a Hulu watch your Veronica?
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   >> Oh yeah, I use Hulu all the time.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   I was really bummed out by the whole situation with Boxy in particular because
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   when I miss shows on TV, I like to watch them on Hulu, but I also like to still
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   do it in the comfort of my own living room.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   I mean, my computer is great and all, but it's a lot better to be able to sit on
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   the couch and control it that way.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   So this makes me even a little more angry because now it's got all the ABC content
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   on there and NBC rather is ABC or NBC that just signed up.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   >> ABC.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   >> ABC.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   >> And I'm a big lost fan and I've wanted to watch it on Hulu for a long time.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   Yeah, so it's kind of a disappointment for me actually.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   >> I use Hulu primarily when I travel, you know, when you're in a hotel room and
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   you just don't want to, you know, you just kind of want to chill out for the evening.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   Hulu is how I watch television.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   I don't even turn on the television in the hotel room anymore.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   I just fire it up and catch up on stuff.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   >> I love Hulu.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   I watch people like Veronica and Colleen, younger people in their 20s.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   And to the, you know, I think a lot of times, I think the reason Hulu got pulled off
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   of Boxy is because some of the content creators somehow thought that
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   displaying it on a screen, on a computer screen was different than displaying it on a TV.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   They didn't want it displayed on the TV, right, for some crazy reason.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   >> Yeah, they definitely complained directly to Boxy about that.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   And they tried to come up with some kind of work around.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   Boxy worked very, very hard with them in order to keep that content on there.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   But at the end of the day, they wanted to pull it.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   >> You know, the downloads of our shows are on Boxy, O-D-T-V.me.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   I bet Texil is on Boxy, right?
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   >> It's stupid of somebody like NBC to say, or Foxy.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   We don't want to be on Boxy because if you're not on Boxy, others will be, you know?
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   >> I think it's a huge problem for broadcast TV because Hulu Unboxy is so good.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   It's such a good experience.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   But, you know, they're not making millions of dollars on ads on Hulu.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   If you look at the ads on Hulu, a lot of the time, they're public service messages.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   And I think they're all afraid of the notion that they might be giving up those expensive
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   Super Bowl type ad campaigns for whatever they can get for Hulu.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   And I think it's really regrettable that they're being obnoxious and stringing up Boxy.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   But I also, on some level, sort of understand why they're terrified of it catching on.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   >> This is, I think- >> But don't you think it's short-sighted?
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   I mean- >> Yes, it's very short-sighted.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   >> Very short-sighted. >> Because eventually, all TV will be that basic metaphor.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   It'll all come over to the Internet.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   It's going to happen fairly soon.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   >> I just think people like Veronica and Collin, the younger people, a screen is a screen.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   It doesn't make a distinction between it being on your screen in your living room of Veronica
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   and your computer, or does it?
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   >> Well, like I said, it is nice to be able to watch it in my living room.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   >> You like to sit at the couch.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   >> At the end of the day, I'm going to go where the content is.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   >> Right.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   I think it's very good for people like you, for independent content creators.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   See, the big guys have, and this has always been the case, when you have an existing business,
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   whether you're the record industry, the television business, the movie industry, and you don't
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   want to cannibalize it.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   So you stay away or the New York Times.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   So you stay away from these new distribution media because you go, "Oh gosh, you know,
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   it's going to cannibalize our TV viewing."
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   That is an opening for everybody who doesn't have all that existing relationships.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   >> We don't have all the baggage. >> Yeah.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   >> Right.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   >> Right.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   The other thing is that, you know, Harry mentioned that they don't have a lot of ads on there,
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   but when they do have ads on Hulu, you don't have the choice to not watch them.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   When they play, you can't fast forward them.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   >> Oh, that's interesting.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   >> You can mute them.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   That's about as much control as you have.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:39.500]   If I was an advertiser looking at the way people deal with ads, say, on a DVR now, where they
[00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:45.000]   can fast forward through them and skip them and certainly mute them, I would look at Hulu
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   as more of an opportunity.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.800]   Probably more people are actually sitting and watching the ads rather than, say, on a
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:52.800]   DVR.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:53.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.800]   >> That's a really totally great comment because it's true.
[00:14:55.800 --> 00:15:00.800]   I mean, I've sat through tons of commercials on Hulu and not even thought twice about it,
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:04.800]   but if I'm on my TV watching it over Tivo, I fast forward through those suckers as fast
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.800]   as my thumb can hit the button.
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.800]   So it's a captive audience when you've got them on Hulu there.
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.800]   They don't really have a way of not watching it unless they, you know, switch tabs, I guess,
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.800]   and their browser and mute it.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:20.400]   >> It does seem like Hulu is harder than the right place and that it's the content owners
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.400]   who are preventing them from doing things like Boxse.
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:26.800]   My sense is that if we were to hold that stuff, they'd be moving a lot more aggressively.
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:31.520]   You have to give Hulu his own by old Hollywood, but they really do a great job.
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:32.520]   The interface is great.
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:36.160]   >> They did a deal with the devil and now the devil's wants is due.
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.160]   >> Yeah.
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:41.320]   So they have to get those guys to understand and sooner or later they will, but I hope it's
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.320]   sooner rather than later.
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:47.200]   >> I'm also curious as to the number of people who watch Boxse on a computer, use Boxse
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.200]   on a computer.
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.200]   >> I do.
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:51.200]   >> So I have a TV.
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:56.080]   If you're doing it that way, it just presents it in a really nice, wide screen version.
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:59.800]   I'll use it on my 24-inch iMac.
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:03.600]   And in that case, it's just the same as watching it on Hulu.
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:07.920]   I don't know how many people are actually using it, say, through Apple TV or some other
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:12.400]   hack where they're getting it on their big screen TV, which is what they're afraid of.
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.320]   So I'd love to see some numbers as to how people are actually using Boxse.
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.720]   >> Yeah, and they're dumb to be afraid.
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:21.120]   And I think the ABC deal proves it because ABC has its own website.
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:25.440]   You could watch those shows on the ABC website, but they saw the value of being on Hulu.
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:28.800]   And some of the value of Hulu is not just that it's another website.
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.160]   I think it has to be that it offers more opportunities.
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:38.280]   I bet you ABC with a third of that company pushes them back towards things like Boxse.
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:39.280]   They must.
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.040]   Otherwise, what if they gain by going to Hulu except I guess there's more eyeballs.
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:45.600]   But I mean, they put this stuff on ABC.
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:49.240]   Why would you buy Hulu if you've already got a website?
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:54.120]   >> Disney historically has been fairly progressive in terms of adopting new technologies and
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.400]   being open-minded.
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:58.360]   And Robert Eiger seems to be fairly smart about this stuff.
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.680]   So I would hope he wouldn't push them in the right direction.
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:04.480]   >> And there's still a connection between ABC and Apple, right?
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:06.920]   >> Well, that's actually the interesting thing.
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:10.040]   Yeah, I mean, Steve Jobs is on the board of both.
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:12.560]   Pixar is owned by Disney.
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:20.040]   But Business Week supposes that it actually hurts Apple because Apple doesn't create content,
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.000]   distribute it for free online.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.640]   Hulu is going right up against Apple's model.
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:29.160]   Hulu is saying, yeah, not only do we own the content, we're going to offer it to you for
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:30.160]   free.
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.360]   Yeah, you could buy it on the iTunes store.
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.200]   But wouldn't you want to get a free-
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:37.920]   >> But I guess the advantage that Apple has in this scenario is that it's very easy for
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:41.280]   you to download an episode of Lost, even though you are paying for it without commercials
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:45.160]   though, and put it on your iPhone or iPod Touch and taking it with you on the go.
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:46.160]   >> So which do you prefer?
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.680]   >> It just depends on how you want to consume the content.
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:51.920]   I mean, at the end of the day, I travel enough that it makes sense for me to want to have
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:54.480]   it on my iPhone there so I can take it with me.
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:58.920]   But when I'm home, I'd rather just sit through the 15, 30-second commercials on Hulu and
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.080]   watch it that way now.
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.640]   >> You know, I have an opinion on this stuff.
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:08.280]   One of the reasons we're doing live streaming video is because our bread and butter is still
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:12.240]   downloadable content, whether it's audio or start doing downloadable video.
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.520]   I think it's too hard for people.
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:20.600]   And I think the generation that grew up with turning on the TV and watching prefers to watch
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:26.280]   on Hulu or live.twit.tv because you just go to a website and there it is.
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:27.840]   You don't have to figure out how to download it.
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:31.160]   You have to find the content, download it, put it on a device.
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.840]   So I- >> I think there's something about having
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:36.600]   a tangible copy of what you want to watch.
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:41.560]   I think people like having a copy on their hard drive for watching later or using on different
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:42.560]   devices.
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:46.040]   I think there's still that feeling that goes way back to when we had everything on CDs
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:49.240]   and VHS and DVD.
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:52.560]   Streaming video is all well and good, but unless there's some kind of copy that you can refer
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:55.280]   to later, people feel like they're not getting that sense of value.
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:56.280]   >> Well, you have to do both.
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.360]   I mean, I know that people want to Tivo it, right?
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:02.680]   I mean, we've offered streaming video and all that did was increase the drumbeat for downloadable
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:03.680]   video.
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:07.320]   But I think streaming is the future just because it's so easy.
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:11.040]   And if you want to download a copy, fine.
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:12.040]   But it's the starting point.
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:15.920]   And I think it's why Hulu is really, really, really important for these networks.
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:18.280]   >> I think streaming is the impulse.
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.280]   >> Right.
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:22.040]   >> And downloading is kind of the planning.
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:24.920]   So when you sit down to Hulu, it's kind of like resetting.
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:26.640]   I think I'll watch some Hulu now.
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:30.520]   I don't think anybody says, "I'm going to go home and then after dinner I'll sit down
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:31.520]   and watch Hulu."
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.320]   I think they do it on impulse.
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:34.920]   >> Well, they do it on the road.
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:37.720]   >> They do that with their TV, though, right?
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:38.720]   How many people?
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:39.720]   This is how we watch TV.
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:40.920]   Is it down and you watch TV?
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:41.920]   >> Right.
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:47.720]   But I'm saying in terms of if you're planning it, you download a copy to watch later, you
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:49.760]   save it to your DVR.
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:54.080]   I think that's kind of the planning, the forethought, and streaming is more of an impulse.
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.840]   >> So you don't think it's that it's so hard, you think that it's just that the--
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:58.160]   >> It's easy.
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.160]   It's actually easy.
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.160]   Streaming is easy.
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.160]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.160]   >> Yeah.
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.160]   >> So it's really planning.
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:05.200]   It's hard to figure out.
[00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:09.560]   I think the early adopters are going to figure this out.
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:10.720]   The four of us have figured it.
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:13.680]   Anybody listening to Twits figure this out.
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:18.160]   But if you're going to get the mass audience, which Hulu and Disney want, you've got to
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:21.160]   make it really easy for them.
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:24.600]   And right now getting a podcast, video or audio is not that easy.
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.840]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:35.040]   >> You can watch it on the site and you can also download it.
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:36.040]   >> That's it.
[00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:37.280]   You have it on the site and it's playable.
[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:41.800]   What do you know of percentage of people watching on the site versus downloading it?
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:42.800]   >> You know, I don't.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.840]   I have a feeling that it's more downloads and streams, but don't quote me on that.
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:46.840]   I'm really not sure.
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:52.800]   >> Oh, for us it's more downloads for sure, but it's a surprise, like 40% come to our
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:55.400]   site and listen to the audio, which to me seems inconvenient.
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:21:00.240]   >> I mean, but as far as our stream is far more, you know, maybe maybe I don't know
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:04.360]   how to check four or 5,000 people are watching this compared to the 180,000 that will download
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:05.360]   it.
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:06.960]   >> I suspect they listen to it while they work.
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:07.960]   >> Yeah.
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:10.240]   >> That's just runs over the line.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:14.120]   >> That's kind of the new model, I think, is yeah, you got to go in all the time.
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:17.480]   It only works if you, you know, that's what I think.
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:18.480]   That's why we're doing this stream.
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:19.680]   I mean, I might be crazy.
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:20.680]   I don't know.
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:22.320]   But that's why we're doing the stream is that people will just go there and they leave
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:23.760]   it running all day.
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.560]   It's like a race, like having the radio in the back.
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:26.560]   >> Like having radio.
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:29.680]   In fact, it's, for some businesses, it's an issue.
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:30.680]   >> Yes.
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.680]   >> We haven't done it in a while.
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:35.800]   >> We're blocked in a lot of businesses, right, because of the bandwidth.
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:36.800]   >> Yeah.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:41.040]   >> So I think that that's, you know, it becomes a, but a lot of people do use internet radio
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:45.560]   and streaming audio and video is kind of the way they used to have a clock radio next
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:46.960]   to their desk all day.
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.120]   >> Well, get this.
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:49.640]   Talk about bandwidth.
[00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:52.920]   Cable vision, which has always been kind of the most forward looking cable company, I
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:53.920]   think.
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:59.880]   They pretty much serve, it's mostly New York City, Long Island, a little bit of New Jersey,
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:01.440]   a little bit of Connecticut.
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:05.160]   They have announced that they are going to offer uncapped.
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:08.880]   This is a response to Time Warner and Comcast, right?
[00:22:08.880 --> 00:22:18.200]   Uncapped 101 megabit service starting next week in their tire service area for 99 bucks
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.400]   a month.
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:22.480]   I'd buy it.
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:23.480]   >> I'd buy it.
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:28.400]   >> I wonder how fast it will really be given that any broadband I've ever had has never
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:32.000]   come anywhere close to what they claim on a reliable basis.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.120]   Well, but if they claim 100, you might actually get 50, right?
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:36.120]   >> True.
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:37.120]   That would be fabulous.
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:39.800]   >> It's Docsis III, which is capable of that.
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:43.320]   >> And it depends on what, you know, the server you're talking to is capable of giving
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:46.000]   you two and what the rest of the pipes between here and there.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   >> Yeah, really.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.320]   No, none of my servers are 100 megabit.
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:54.280]   If you came to our server, if 10 people with 100 megabit connections came to our server,
[00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:55.280]   that'd be saturated.
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:56.280]   That'd be over.
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:57.280]   >> Right.
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:58.280]   >> No, I mean, that's a gigabit right there.
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:22:59.280]   We can't do that.
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:04.040]   However, I think the more important word in there is uncapped.
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:08.400]   That's really what, this is a, and I, you know, this is why competition is so important.
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:12.960]   There is no competition in the cable industry, but I just love the idea that when Time Warner
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:17.120]   has, you know, they've gone back and forth the latest is, well, all right, maybe we won't
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:21.880]   do cap service, but they were talking really low caps.
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:26.080]   Even Comcast with this 250 gigabyte cap was bothering some people.
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:30.880]   It bothers me because if you watched all of our content, it could easily eat up to 250
[00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:32.640]   gigabytes a month.
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:35.800]   So I like this, but what it's also saying, I remember talking to these cable vision guys
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:39.720]   at CES about five or six years ago.
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:43.560]   And I said, well, I said, why don't you guys just think of yourself as a internet company
[00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:47.840]   is just provide bits and they said, that's not our business model.
[00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:48.840]   We can't do that.
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:50.040]   We would, we would go bankrupt.
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:51.640]   There's not enough value in bits.
[00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:53.800]   We have to sell premium content.
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:58.880]   And I think that's why Comcast and Time Warner are saying we're going to do caps.
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:03.160]   Is there afraid of people using this high speed internet to get all their video to watch
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:05.200]   everything on Hulu?
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:09.040]   So this is almost cable vision capitulating saying, okay, if we can get a hundred bucks
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:13.240]   out of you, I guess you can get all your content on the internet.
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:19.760]   Well, you know, and as you watch AT&T, which has not gone into this yet, but keeps talking
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:24.360]   that they as though they might start capping things as they get more and more involved
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:28.920]   and sell more and more subscriptions to Uvers, they're starting to pay more attention to
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:29.920]   it.
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:33.680]   And I wouldn't be surprised if because they have to sell premium content too, that you
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:35.720]   don't see AT&T getting capped.
[00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:41.400]   I think when one company like cable vision comes along, it might cause a shift.
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:46.280]   I would love it if all these companies would say, and I think, you know what?
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:47.280]   What do they need to make?
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:49.400]   I mean, a hundred bucks is a lot of money.
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:53.000]   If they could get all their customers to pay them a hundred bucks, wouldn't they be
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   happy?
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.200]   I mean, how much, what's your cable bill, Dwight?
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:25:01.080]   My cable bill, I have unused unbundled Comcast.
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:07.160]   I think it's eight megabits for about close to 70 bucks.
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:14.120]   If I bundled it with Comcast cable, it would be about 50.
[00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:15.920]   So you don't get any TV on your Comcast?
[00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:19.320]   No, I use Uvers television and Comcast internet.
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:22.360]   So if you combine the television and the internet, what are you spending?
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:24.960]   Probably 150, right?
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:31.600]   Probably about 120 bucks altogether, but it's less actually than when we were using Tivo
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:36.760]   and Comcast and television and internet.
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:37.760]   So it's actually less.
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.560]   You're what scares these companies because you're spending less and less money as you
[00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:41.560]   get more money.
[00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:42.560]   Right, I'm breaking it up.
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:43.560]   I've got bundled it.
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:44.560]   How about you, Veronica?
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:45.960]   I mean, you're somebody who watches a lot of internet television.
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:48.680]   Do you have a big cable bill for TV?
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:52.760]   I think our cable bill total, oh geez, I paid automatically, so I don't even remember
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:53.760]   what the charge is.
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:57.120]   I think it's like 140 bucks for TV and internet.
[00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:58.120]   That's a lot.
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.240]   I'm guessing it's up there.
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:05.120]   So if you were smart enough to get all your TV via this 101 megabit connection, you'd
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:07.120]   be saving money at 100 bucks.
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:08.120]   Yeah.
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:09.120]   And they'd be saving a customer.
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:12.280]   They may be happy to get your 100 bucks instead of your 150 just because at least they keep
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:13.280]   you.
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:14.280]   How about you, Harry?
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:15.280]   What do you think?
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:20.880]   You know, for me, I also paid automatically, I believe it's 140 for TV, internet access
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:24.120]   and a phone line, which I don't really use.
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:25.120]   Oh, phone line.
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:26.880]   I don't have a phone line.
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:27.880]   That's fancy.
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:28.880]   Oh, are you a white?
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:29.880]   Are you all white, though?
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:33.120]   So I'm going to give Comcast less money and if Comcast gave me incentives to give them
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:35.320]   more money, it would be a good thing for them.
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:36.320]   Right.
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:38.560]   Sounds like we have the same Comcast deal.
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:42.880]   And of course, I signed up for the triple play at some absurdly low rate and then discovered
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.680]   it didn't include HD.
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:49.160]   It didn't include even really basic TV channels like MSNBC.
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:54.360]   So the moment I actually started to get it, it jumped from $50 for triple play or whatever
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:55.360]   to 140.
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:59.280]   I'm going to go out on a limb and say that this could be the first domino.
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:02.760]   The cable vision may have finally said, you know, this is the way it is.
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:05.720]   It's at least get the hundred bucks.
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:08.520]   And when people start looking at their cable bill, as soon as they get smart enough to
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:13.160]   figure out that they can watch everything for free using the internet, this is going
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:17.280]   to be the, this may be the beginning of the end for this whole mass.
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:19.360]   It's a huge conflict of interest right now.
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:22.880]   You know, for Comcast to say, well, we don't want you to use VoIP.
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:25.120]   We don't want you to download files.
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:29.880]   We don't want you to watch streaming video because you're undermining our business model.
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:30.960]   They're not going to get away with that.
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:35.800]   And I think the new FCC commissioner, Julian, Jenna Kowski is not going to go for Julius.
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:37.080]   Jenna Kowski is not going to go for that.
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:40.640]   I think that this is, they're seeing the writing on the wall, the regulatory environments,
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:41.800]   not in their favor anymore.
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:45.200]   And I think they might be saying, all right.
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.360]   But it's a hundred bucks.
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:47.360]   It's a hundred bucks.
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:48.360]   Too much cable vision.
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:49.360]   Cable vision is not that big.
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:52.240]   They're small, but they, but they're very, they're very technologically sophisticated.
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:54.680]   I would say they're the most sophisticated cable company.
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:58.200]   Their optimum online is very, is always been very fast and good.
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:00.600]   And they are in a very dense metro.
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:04.200]   I mean, they are in the most dense metro of all.
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:05.600]   So that makes them, I'm sure, very profitable.
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:08.200]   They don't have to string as much cable to get to the customers.
[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:15.860]   But in the, in the, in the ecosystem of cable television and cable internet providers,
[00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:16.860]   how influential are they?
[00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:21.520]   In other words, for example, if Comcast were to do this, that would be, I would say that
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:26.400]   you may have a point that it could be the domino, but cable vision is a relatively small
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:30.760]   player to Comcast and charter and, and time Warner.
[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:36.080]   And so I'm not sure that, you know, I'll, I'll, I'll play the John de Vorac role here.
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:37.200]   I don't think so.
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:41.240]   I may be, I may be, it's a little wishful thinking on my part.
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:45.160]   It might be a little wishful thing on my part, but, but what I do believe is cable vision
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:48.520]   is a, is a kind of at the forefront of all this.
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:49.520]   They're very advanced thinking.
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:52.240]   So that's why I think they might be a bellwether for this.
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:58.640]   Well, in, in looking at the statements that time Warner made, when it backed away from
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:05.200]   its tiered and multiple cap service, which it was testing right down the road here in
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:10.080]   Beaumont, when they backed away from that, you know, kind of their closing word was,
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.400]   this is, this is what we want to do.
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:13.880]   And we're going to figure out a way to do it.
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:14.880]   We want to do it.
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:15.880]   Yeah.
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:16.880]   Right.
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:19.360]   And, but I was really intrigued by your comment about the regulatory environment.
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:24.520]   I wonder if, you know, granted they had a consumer uprising, but I also wonder if they
[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:30.200]   didn't look at what was happening at the FCC and said, uh, we got two fronts against
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:31.200]   us here.
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:36.360]   Jenna Casky is, is big on internet net neutrality, huge net neutrality guy.
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:40.200]   Uh, in fact, we're, we got to get Debbie Jones wants to come on the show and I'll get
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.360]   her on maybe next week.
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:46.800]   She's, uh, big on this, uh, broadband access, universal broadband access.
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.440]   Jenna Casky, very big on that too.
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:53.720]   I think those are two important initiatives already that are in the forefront.
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:54.760]   And I think this impacts them.
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:59.320]   I think that they're, this is not the friendly FCC and it wasn't so friendly in the last
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:02.600]   eight years, but this is not the friendly FCC that they might have had.
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:07.560]   Comcast had their own, you know, tussles with the FCC for the last few years, but I think
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.800]   you're going to, I think there's some push in that direction.
[00:30:09.800 --> 00:30:10.880]   I'd love to see that.
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:11.960]   I hope you're right.
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:12.960]   I hope I'm right too.
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:13.960]   And I hope you're wrong.
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:16.120]   I'd be happy to be wrong.
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:17.280]   I hope you're wrong.
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:19.200]   Please make me wrong.
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:23.560]   Um, let's talk about, I'll tell you what, when we come back, I want to, I do, there are
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:28.640]   a few other things we might want to talk about, the Palm pre and the Pixie, uh, say,
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:31.640]   you know, there's a little trouble in paradise.
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:34.200]   We'll talk about that.
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:37.480]   Time Warner is going to spin off America online.
[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:39.800]   Could be good for both.
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:44.360]   Apple says they might want to design their own chips and 60% of Twitters are Quitters
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:48.600]   within the first month, all of that coming up in just a little bit.
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:50.720]   I do want to mention audible.com.
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:55.280]   You use sometimes, uh, on a sword and laser, you're a science fiction podcast for Monica.
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:57.520]   Don't you use audible?
[00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:59.440]   Listen to science fiction on audible.
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:00.440]   I do.
[00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:02.800]   I'm actually listening to the eye of the world series right now in audible.
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:05.520]   I was hoping I was going to, sorry, the wheel of time series.
[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:06.520]   Wheel of toe.
[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:07.520]   That sounds familiar.
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:08.520]   Who does that?
[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:10.640]   Um, that is, uh, Robert Jordan.
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:11.640]   Is it good?
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:12.640]   Is that right?
[00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:13.640]   Did I, is that right?
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:14.640]   My author is confused.
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:15.640]   Yeah, it's really good.
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:20.680]   I'm right now I'm on the, uh, the dragon reborn, which is book three and I listened to the
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:21.680]   second.
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:22.680]   Oh my God.
[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:23.680]   There's like a dozen of them.
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:24.680]   There is literally a dozen.
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:25.680]   Oh my God.
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:28.360]   I think they're working on book 12 right now.
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:34.320]   Um, and, and do they go one or the other or are they, uh, tell me, tell me a little
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:35.480]   bit about these stories.
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:40.080]   Um, it's a one continuous story and we've read, I read the first one in, in regular book
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:43.600]   form and then I was reading so many other books at the time that I was like, I want
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:46.600]   something to take with me to go during my commute.
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:50.960]   So I download the second and third book and listen to them while traveling and also, uh,
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:53.640]   during my commute just sometimes at home also.
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:57.480]   And there, there's two different voice actors that read all the parts and they do a really
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:58.480]   great job.
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:02.320]   Well, if you are, uh, in a book club, that's what got great reason to join Audible.
[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:04.600]   It's a great way to read your books.
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:08.920]   They have beefed up their science fiction, uh, uh, uh, section immensely with their audible
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:10.560]   frontiers and so forth.
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:15.160]   And I think I'm just going to make this a recommendation, the eye of the world book one,
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:16.880]   uh, the, the wheel of time.
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:18.120]   There you go.
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:20.920]   And, uh, there are 11 wheel of time.
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:21.920]   See, I love it.
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:26.320]   If you find something you're really into book one, by the way, 30 hours.
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:27.880]   It's a long, long book.
[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:28.880]   Yeah.
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:29.880]   They're all pretty long.
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:30.880]   Are they all that long?
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:32.440]   Yep.
[00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:33.440]   Is it fantasy?
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:34.440]   What is it?
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:35.440]   Um, it's fantasy.
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:36.440]   Yeah.
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:39.240]   And actually Robert Jordan passed away this past year.
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:43.520]   And so his, uh, they're getting another author to finish the series on book 12.
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:44.520]   Yeah.
[00:32:44.520 --> 00:32:45.520]   Awful when that happens, you know, you can.
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:46.520]   I know.
[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:47.520]   Can you believe it?
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:49.000]   It was going to be the last book.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.280]   And so it's, it's someone who's really familiar with the storyline and the characters though,
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:54.200]   and who writes in a similar tone.
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:56.800]   Uh, so hopefully it'll be as good as all the other ones have been.
[00:32:56.800 --> 00:32:59.440]   Let me, this is Kate reading and Michael Kramer.
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:00.440]   Yes.
[00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:03.640]   Let me play a little bit of this just so you can hear kind of what it sounds like.
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:06.480]   Have you the voice stranger?
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:11.280]   It will soon be time for the singing and here all are welcome to take part.
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:12.480]   Ileana my love.
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:13.480]   We have a guest.
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:14.480]   Ileana.
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:17.360]   Is this going to be one of those books where they got like 8,000 names you have to keep
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:18.360]   track of?
[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:19.880]   Um, a little bit.
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:21.200]   They stick with the same characters.
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:22.920]   So they, so you get used to them.
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:27.360]   And it's funny because the male voice actor does female voices in the book.
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:30.920]   And vice versa, there's a female voice actress who does the male parts.
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:33.280]   Um, but you get used to it so quickly.
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:34.280]   Oh yeah.
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:38.480]   You know, there's two different styles of audio books, one where the guy like Jim Dale does
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:41.400]   every voice and everyone's a distinct character.
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:44.760]   In fact, it's funny because the Harry Potter books in the US were recorded by Jim Dale
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:46.520]   in Audible, England.
[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:50.840]   It's Steven Fry and Fry is much more of the thing where he gets my slight differences,
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:53.440]   but he's not trying to act out every voice.
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:54.440]   And it's just a different style.
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:57.720]   I kind of like the Fry style of, you know, I don't mind it at all.
[00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:58.720]   All right.
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:00.720]   Well, it's just a slight difference between the different voices.
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:01.720]   Yeah.
[00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:05.960]   It's subtle enough that you can tell who's talking, but at the same time, you know, it's not too
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:06.960]   distracting.
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:10.800]   Sometimes it takes me out of it when all of a sudden he's talking like this, you know,
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:15.320]   and it just kind of, it sounds, it's like the guy's kind of a little crazy to be honest
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:16.680]   with you.
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:17.680]   So I kind of like that.
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:20.120]   I like a little bit more subtle in my, in my book.
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:26.840]   Have you read, I'm reading, um, talk about another long, uh, series.
[00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:29.240]   It's, uh, what's his name?
[00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:30.240]   I think he would like this.
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:33.360]   It's another fantasy series I'm reading on audible.com.
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:34.560]   Seeing if I can find it here.
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:36.560]   So you say you're reading on audible.
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:37.560]   Yeah.
[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:38.560]   I say it.
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:39.560]   I say listening.
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:40.560]   I get in trouble.
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:41.560]   People say you're not reading.
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:42.560]   You're listening.
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:43.560]   But I am reading.
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:44.560]   It's every word of the book.
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:47.680]   What's the difference whether it comes through your eyeballs or your ear hole?
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:48.680]   Your ear hole.
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:49.680]   Good point.
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:50.680]   What's the difference?
[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:51.680]   It's reading.
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:52.680]   It's reading a book.
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:53.680]   I think it counts.
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:56.200]   I'm going to anyway, you can call it whatever you want.
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:59.360]   Go to audible.com right now.
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:02.240]   If you actually go to audible.com/twit2, you get the platinum plane.
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:05.400]   You're going to need it if you're going to read the wheel of time.
[00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:08.920]   The platinum plane gives you two books a month and your first two books are free.
[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:10.600]   See you want this.
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:12.920]   I have the regular standard plan, the one book a month.
[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:13.920]   You're a gold.
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:16.160]   That's all I need because it takes so long to get through these.
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:17.360]   You don't have a long commute.
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:18.360]   You don't have a long commute.
[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:22.240]   If you had a long, if you had a two hour, I used to, I'd go through three books a month.
[00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:25.200]   I know people have two platinum plants because they do four books a month.
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:26.400]   You're a fast listener.
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:27.400]   Yes.
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:29.280]   I've, you know you can, by the way.
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:31.640]   You can't turn the speed up on these.
[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:32.640]   I don't.
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:35.560]   How fast can you go but while you still understand it?
[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:38.640]   The iPod only lets you go slow, medium, fast.
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:40.040]   It doesn't, so I don't know.
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:41.040]   It's like 30%.
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.600]   It doesn't, it's, you know what?
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:43.960]   Your brain's very good at absorbing.
[00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:47.560]   In fact, it turns out it's better at hearing stuff if people talk quickly.
[00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:50.400]   So it doesn't sound like all of them that chipmunks?
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:51.400]   No, no, no.
[00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:54.280]   They're doing, it's the iPod to some sort of pitch shifting.
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:58.360]   Anyway, this plays on the iPod, the Kindle, the Zoom, pretty much every portable device.
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:02.760]   I'm told that the GPS devices are big for Audible because people have them in their car.
[00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:04.520]   They often have memory and they all play Audible.
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:05.520]   So give it a try.
[00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:06.520]   Audible.com/twit2.
[00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:12.760]   I'm going to let Veronica pick our book this week, book one of the Wheel of Time, 30 Hours
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:15.760]   of the Eye of the World by Robert Jordan.
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:19.000]   And then you can go to sortinlaser.com and talk about it.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.160]   Yeah, we had our, that was one of our recent books.
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:23.200]   So we actually had a whole podcast on that one as well.
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:27.000]   So you do a podcast and then is it like a book group where you have like forums and people
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.600]   come and talk and that kind of thing?
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:29.600]   Or how does that work?
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:34.160]   Yeah, we have Ning forums at sortinlaser.ting.com where we do all our discussions about the books
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:35.160]   that we're reading.
[00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:37.200]   And then once a month, Tom and I get together.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:41.520]   Tom Merritt from CNET, of course, and discuss the book a little bit and talk about readers'
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:44.600]   comments and just, you know, regular books, club stuff.
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:45.600]   Did Tom like this book?
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:46.600]   Just give us a little.
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:47.600]   Yeah, he liked it.
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:48.600]   Oh, good.
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:50.000]   Alright, then I'll read it.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.160]   It's not a checkbook.
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:53.960]   It's not a checkbook, don't worry.
[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:56.920]   Well, there are fantasy books.
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:59.520]   That are just really romance novels, right?
[00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:02.720]   Yeah, you might not like the Jacqueline Carey novels.
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:03.720]   Right.
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:05.280]   Some of them are kind of romancy.
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:08.240]   And then there's, but there's some, like, sword fighting in this, right?
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:12.360]   Yeah, there's a good amount of sword fighting and magic.
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:14.600]   Explosions, don't forget explosions.
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:19.120]   As long as they're magical explosions.
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:21.240]   Apple has decided this is a very interesting story.
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:24.080]   I don't know what to make of it that they're, they've been hiring.
[00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:30.280]   You remember they bought PA Semi, so they have engineers in house like a design chips.
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:31.960]   It's not clear whether these are armed.
[00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:38.640]   They're basically arm chips for, I would assume, the iPhone, but maybe other portable devices,
[00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:43.000]   including the rumored tablet iPhone.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:49.560]   And now there are more than a hundred job listings for Apple looking for chip designers,
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:52.280]   chip engineers, quality control engineers.
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:57.080]   It's pretty clear Apple has decided to design and build its own chips.
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:02.680]   So they would be taking that away from like Samsung, for example, to make sure it's in
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:03.680]   the past.
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:06.680]   Yeah, if it's armed, but you know, what if they decided to do this for desktops too?
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:08.800]   And well, here's one conspiracy theory.
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:09.800]   It would be a way.
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:13.760]   One of the problems Apple has is it's really easy to build a hackintosh, right?
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:15.480]   It's trivial.
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:20.400]   You could put a, you could put OS 10 on a, I have it on an MSI wind.
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:22.040]   It's easy.
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:24.240]   They haven't been able to shut that down.
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:28.840]   If you made your own chips that only you sold, you wouldn't have that problem.
[00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:31.520]   You'd have absolute control of hardware and software.
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:34.000]   But haven't they been down that road before?
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.440]   I mean, to a certain extent, their early processors were-
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:41.040]   No, they were always used in their machines.
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:52.000]   No, the power PC processor was a joint development between IBM and them and Motorola.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.120]   And it seems like they've kind of have done that before.
[00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:58.120]   And then they moved to Intel because of performance and heat and battery.
[00:38:58.120 --> 00:38:59.760]   So you think it would be a bad idea?
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:04.600]   Well, I think I could see them doing it for a handheld device.
[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:06.760]   I think that makes a lot of sense.
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:12.160]   And increasingly, things like the iPhone are becoming more and more a part of what they
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:13.160]   do.
[00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:17.680]   And I can see them wanting to get some kind of an edge and hold it in that area.
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:23.040]   But for desktops, at this point, I think there's a benefit for them using a relatively open
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:24.040]   platform.
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:28.800]   I think the percentage of people who are actually doing hack and tosses aren't enough to really
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:29.800]   impact their sale.
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:34.160]   Well, I feel like it's more of them trying to control their supply line because I mean,
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:37.400]   wasn't it back in the day when the iPhone first started coming out that Samsung couldn't
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:41.840]   meet up with the demands for the chips and that kind of restricted how many iPhones were
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:42.840]   coming out at first?
[00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:43.840]   Am I-
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:44.840]   That's a right.
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:45.840]   No, that's a good point.
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:48.160]   They control their own manufacturing line with the chips.
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:50.280]   They might not have to worry about that kind of situation.
[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:54.360]   And also, Samsung is technically a competing company and they have to worry about less
[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:57.520]   leaks that way if they aren't putting in orders for new products.
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:58.520]   That's exactly-
[00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:01.960]   Oh, presumably somebody other than Apple will be manufacturing these chips, so they'll
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:02.960]   still have that issue.
[00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:03.960]   They don't have tabs.
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:10.160]   They don't really feel like the operating system, which is currently on the iPhone,
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:16.400]   is going to be around after they're no longer Macintosh's as we know them now.
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:19.800]   And I don't know whether Apple is thinking the way I am, but I think they could be preparing
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:24.480]   themselves for that because I think we're at the beginning of the end of desktop.
[00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:25.480]   You think-
[00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:26.480]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:27.480]   Now, this is interesting.
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:29.480]   You think desktop PCs are going away?
[00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:30.480]   Eventually.
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:35.320]   I mean, I really believe that the phone is going to be the new PC over time or at the
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:40.400]   beginning of the end of Windows and Windtell, and I don't know whether Apple is thinking
[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:46.240]   that way, but I feel fairly confident that the descendants of the iPhone will be around
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:50.520]   after they're no longer descendants of today's MacBooks or iMacs.
[00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:53.120]   And they'll probably be a little bit more proprietary than today's Macs.
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:58.800]   There'd be a wise thing for them to plan for an era, a post-PC era.
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:00.920]   I sure would be if I were them.
[00:41:00.920 --> 00:41:01.920]   That's really interesting.
[00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:03.840]   It's the kind of thing Apple would do.
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:08.240]   They do think ahead like that in a way that a lot of manufacturers don't.
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:09.240]   Huh.
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:10.680]   What do you think of that, Dwight?
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:12.240]   Do you think that's a good-
[00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:13.840]   That's a reasonable scenario.
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:14.940]   Is it PC?
[00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:15.940]   How soon?
[00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:17.560]   What's your time frame for that, Harry?
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:21.400]   You know, I always feel like it's better to guess that things will happen more quickly
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:23.200]   than you expected.
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:31.200]   So I feel like a decade from now will be well into sort of a primarily past post-PC era.
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:32.200]   Not completely.
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:34.200]   There's also main frames out there.
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:35.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:40.080]   But I think that most of the things that people do on traditional computers today, they will
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:43.520]   be doing on something which is a descendant of a phone at some point.
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:44.520]   There's so much-
[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:48.320]   There's so much large streams and large keyboards, but there's no reason why you can't use them
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:50.320]   with phones too.
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:51.480]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:57.520]   I heard somebody describe the iPhone as being the multimedia server that everybody-
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:58.760]   Maybe that was you, Harry.
[00:41:58.760 --> 00:41:59.760]   Did you write that?
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:06.600]   That the iPhone was a- Everybody was talking about the multimedia server controller in the
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:10.160]   home and that the iPhone is turning into that?
[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:14.480]   Well, I mean, people have written about the idea that maybe the iPhone is going to turn
[00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:16.480]   into the next Apple TV.
[00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:19.200]   You won't even really need the Apple TV.
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:25.440]   If you have a TV with an internet connection or Wi-Fi and an Apple and an iPhone, it might
[00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:28.720]   be how you get media onto the TV directly.
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:29.720]   And maybe so.
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:34.160]   There's no technological reason why you can't do it, particularly as you get faster access
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:35.160]   to stuff in the cloud.
[00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:40.040]   I feel like the cloud and the phone will replace the PC sooner or later.
[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:43.440]   You're just looking for an interface into the cloud, basically.
[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:44.440]   Yeah.
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:48.080]   Something that's user-friendly and easy to get online with.
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:49.080]   Well, that's what I'm going to-
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:50.480]   You can take it with you on the go.
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:52.280]   That's what Steve Perlman is trying to do with online.
[00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:56.720]   He's saying you don't need a graphics chip to play high-end video games.
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:58.360]   We'll do it all for you on our servers.
[00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:01.800]   Well, you need- In fact, it's ironic because the on-live controller looks a little bit
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:02.800]   like an iPhone.
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:05.000]   Have you talked about that a lot on the show?
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   No, what do you-
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.360]   You're the gamer expert.
[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:08.360]   What do you think of that?
[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:11.880]   I'll just- For people who didn't hear about this, we talked a little bit about it after
[00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:14.720]   GDC, the Game Developers Conference.
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:15.720]   Steve Perlman announced this.
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:19.240]   He has big partners, Electronic Arts, Atari.
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:21.760]   I mean, it looks pretty real.
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:24.680]   The idea being you'd sign up for the service.
[00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:31.920]   You could use an old, low-cheap PC or buy one of their interface devices and attach it
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:36.320]   to your big-screen TV and now play games even as high in as crisis.
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:40.320]   They do the rendering on their servers and with some proprietary technology.
[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:42.120]   I'd be worried about the latency.
[00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:46.880]   Yeah, I think that's probably the biggest worry is the latency issues, lag issues, especially
[00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:47.880]   with bandwidth caps.
[00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:49.960]   Is that going to be a major problem sometime in the future?
[00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:52.320]   Well, I'll tell you my conspiracy theory.
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:53.680]   This is the cable company.
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:57.400]   This relies on a deal with the ISPs because that's who you're going to end up buying this
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:59.080]   service from is you're going to buy.
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:00.080]   You're going to go to Comcast.
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:04.320]   Comcast, so you want our gaming package 10 bucks a month to play any game, then they prioritize.
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:07.360]   They do QoS stuff with online.
[00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:11.160]   On live in other words, I think on live's whole business model relies on partnership
[00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:12.920]   with the internet service providers.
[00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:14.480]   I absolutely agree with you.
[00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:17.360]   I think this is something you're going to see on Comcast boxes.
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:21.080]   I think that's probably where they're planning on going with this in the near future because
[00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:22.080]   that makes total sense.
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:26.360]   If you don't need to have a separate console or a separate PC, you want it just on your
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:27.360]   TV right there.
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:30.040]   If it's on your cable box already, you don't need to have to worry about it.
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:32.000]   You just need a controller to play it on.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.360]   It introduces, I mean, from Atari and EA's point of view, it introduces a whole new group
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:42.240]   of casual gamers who don't own PS3s and Xbox 360s as customers.
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:44.360]   The broadens their base, no piracy.
[00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:46.080]   Makes a lot of sense for all the players.
[00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:49.520]   It's a technical problem, but I think the ISPs can solve that one.
[00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:53.880]   I mean, then you have to make sure that everyone has the same kind of level of connection or
[00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:58.520]   I guess you'd have to make sure that the host at least has a very high speed connection
[00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:02.560]   because when you get 16 people playing on the same game, there's going to be some problems.
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:06.440]   I mean, there's problems now with the systems that we already have set up.
[00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:10.440]   When this happens, though, not only does cloud computing become capable of, you know, word
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:14.680]   processing and spreadsheets and calendaring and email, cloud computing becomes capable
[00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:19.880]   of high end computing, video editing, I mean, gaming is just the beginning of all this.
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:22.080]   So I think you might be right.
[00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:27.160]   The cloud, though, has to get a lot more reliable and you do have to have the bandwidth issues.
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:32.360]   Before people, I think, Veronica mentioned earlier, people want to have a physical copy
[00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:37.440]   and I think that before you get to the point where people trust that and that's where their
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:41.640]   primary computing is done, it's got to get a lot faster and a lot more reliable and you
[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:43.880]   don't have to worry about bandwidth caps.
[00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:44.880]   That is serious.
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:45.880]   Definitely.
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:48.160]   I mean, even Gmail as cool as it is.
[00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:54.560]   I mean, I'd say about 15% of the time I have minor to major problems getting my email
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:59.080]   off of Gmail and there's no big news for the system.
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:00.080]   Always beta.
[00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:05.640]   I'm going to change the name of the company from Google to beta.
[00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:08.080]   We actually Google can't scale this stuff.
[00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:09.960]   Nobody is going to has it figured out yet.
[00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:13.400]   So it does have to get way more reliable.
[00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:19.800]   You've painted an interesting picture, though, Harry, of a world with very simple devices
[00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:23.720]   that aren't PCs connected to very powerful devices on the cloud.
[00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:24.720]   That's my guess.
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:28.360]   I worked at PC World for years and who knows?
[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:32.680]   Maybe I'm overreacting the ship in the opposite direction and think about the future.
[00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:38.280]   But so often in the past, stuff has happened more quickly once it's got going and you would
[00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:39.280]   have expected.
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:42.400]   I mean, the whole thing with digital music is only about 11 years old.
[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:46.000]   And that's not much 11 years old.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.640]   Well, and here's a prediction beyond the cloud.
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:55.640]   At some point, as these cycles go, because essentially the cloud is a return to mainframes
[00:46:55.640 --> 00:47:02.640]   and terminals, we're going to start talking about the personal cloud where you have your
[00:47:02.640 --> 00:47:09.640]   own server at your house that ultimately other people will be able to play on.
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:13.640]   And remotely, you'll be able to connect up to your own system that you rely on.
[00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:15.640]   It'll come back to that eventually.
[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:20.640]   Some of those there are pre-PCS-PX or verbs, is that now?
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:21.640]   Right.
[00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:22.640]   Yeah.
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:29.200]   This also relies on ubiquitous internet because we're not talking about just a direct connect
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:30.200]   in the house now.
[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:34.840]   I'm going to go out the door and I want this device to also work there, right?
[00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:36.480]   Everywhere.
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:37.480]   But I think we're getting close to that.
[00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:41.320]   I mean, all of these pieces seem to be falling in place.
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:44.760]   I hadn't really thought about this, Harry, but I think we might be heading quickly to
[00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:45.760]   the post-PC era.
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:47.680]   And it might be faster than we think.
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:53.040]   But I mean, we're having so much trouble even just trying to get blanketed Wi-Fi in major
[00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:57.480]   cities that would seemingly support it like San Francisco.
[00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:58.480]   That's a major hurdle too.
[00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:01.480]   I mean, if you're not blanketed in Wi-Fi, wherever you go, how are you going to access
[00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:02.480]   your content?
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:07.080]   I mean, 3G is one thing, but I was in a restaurant today that didn't even have edge connection.
[00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:08.080]   And so it's...
[00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:09.080]   Ooh, how did you survive?
[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:10.080]   I know, I couldn't even...
[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:11.080]   Ew.
[00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:14.080]   I couldn't do the Twitter on my phone while I was eating.
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:15.080]   What a shit.
[00:48:15.080 --> 00:48:16.080]   Damn.
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:17.080]   Damn.
[00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:18.080]   Damn.
[00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:20.320]   You know, they should put a sign up on a restaurant that says, "You can't Twitter here."
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:21.640]   I mean, that's terrible.
[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:27.880]   But there's still major hurdles to the whole cloud situation, especially on the go.
[00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:29.680]   Zagat has to add a new thing.
[00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:32.280]   Food quality, service, decor, Twitter capability.
[00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:33.680]   It'll be a whole new...
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:34.680]   Cell phone reception.
[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:36.400]   Cell phone reception, yeah.
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:37.400]   There should be...
[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:40.400]   There's Wi-Fi and Zagat now.
[00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:42.400]   Don't they have Wi-Fi listing in the...
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:43.400]   Do they really?
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:44.400]   I think so.
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:50.080]   I was at a restaurant last night, a fairly fancy one in Houston called Choroscos, which
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:55.920]   if you're ever in Houston, it's the place to go for South American steaks.
[00:48:55.920 --> 00:48:57.400]   And I'm buying.
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:58.400]   Let's go.
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:00.400]   We'll be right there.
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:01.920]   And I'm buying.
[00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:02.920]   Okay.
[00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:05.000]   They had a... and I just...
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:08.720]   I had my iPhone with me and I happened to check it.
[00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:12.360]   And they had a free Wi-Fi, their own Wi-Fi.
[00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:15.280]   Now, this is the kind of place where...
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:17.240]   This is a really nice place to eat.
[00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:21.880]   And almost the kind of place where if someone whips out an iPhone, it's semi-frowned upon.
[00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:24.840]   But they had free Wi-Fi for their customers.
[00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:27.920]   And I was pretty surprised and pleased.
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:28.920]   Well, fancy...
[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:31.240]   It is odd in a fancy restaurant to have...
[00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:32.240]   Yeah.
[00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:33.720]   But everybody does it now.
[00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:35.560]   In fact, it's almost the bane of modern life.
[00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:37.240]   Is it everybody's not looking at...
[00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:39.440]   They're all looking at their iPhone.
[00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:42.320]   Both my daughter and I now have iPhones.
[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:44.360]   We got my daughter one a while back.
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:49.080]   And we sit in the living room, you know, while my wife watches television or whatever.
[00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:51.240]   And we're both like going on our screens.
[00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:52.240]   Yeah.
[00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:55.360]   And we can't watch TV without a screen in my lap anymore.
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:56.360]   That's right.
[00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:57.360]   But what's interesting is...
[00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:58.360]   It's a picture.
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:49:59.360]   Yeah.
[00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:00.360]   Exactly.
[00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:01.520]   I no longer sit there with my laptop.
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:04.520]   I use the iPhone instead of the laptop I used to have.
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:07.320]   This is going to sound really bad.
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:11.680]   Ryan and I actually have a touch that we keep in the living room for exactly that purpose.
[00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:13.400]   It's the living room I put touch.
[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:19.600]   If you need to look up like a cheat in a game or something about an actor on a TV show,
[00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:21.080]   you've got the iPod touch there.
[00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:23.960]   See, what an Apple does is tablet.
[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:24.960]   It's a legend tablet.
[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:26.920]   This is going to have a next month.
[00:50:26.920 --> 00:50:29.320]   This is going to have a next month.
[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:32.360]   You will have that on your coffee table instead, Veronica.
[00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:36.280]   I think Veronica and Ryan are the couple of the future.
[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:37.960]   We need to watch them.
[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:39.560]   They need to be glass.
[00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:41.120]   One way glass put into your apartment.
[00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:42.120]   Oh, no, no.
[00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:43.120]   Reality TV.
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:44.120]   Yeah.
[00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:45.520]   And we will see what the future is going to be like.
[00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:46.520]   The future is now.
[00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:47.520]   That's a great one.
[00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:53.720]   Ryan, by the way, is Ryan Block, who is the host of GDGT and a former founder of Engadget,
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:57.560]   who was between the two of you, you must be completely wired.
[00:50:57.560 --> 00:50:58.560]   I mean...
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:00.320]   It gets a little scary sometimes.
[00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:01.320]   Yeah.
[00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:04.960]   You're not one of those couples that goes to a restaurant and sits across from each other
[00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:06.880]   and talks via IAM, are you?
[00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:08.360]   No, we're not that bad.
[00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:12.200]   There's actually kind of an unspoken rule that you can take out the iPhone after the
[00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:13.200]   check has arrived.
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:14.200]   Oh, that's good.
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:15.960]   No iPhone until the check has arrived.
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:16.960]   Oh, I like that.
[00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:17.960]   I like that.
[00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:19.920]   You're some etiquette here.
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:22.320]   You have to make some kind of etiquette because we're all...
[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:23.840]   This is like the final frontier.
[00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:26.880]   You have to make some ground rules early in the game.
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:28.720]   It's the etiquette for the New World.
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:29.720]   Yeah.
[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:31.440]   I love that.
[00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:35.200]   So the pre, you were talking about how Apple struggled with supply problems.
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:39.400]   Apparently, at least one analyst says, "POM's going to have some problems."
[00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:43.040]   They cut back their initial order for the pre from 1 million to just a few hundred thousand
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:48.320]   not as some thought to create an artificial scarcity, but because they cannot make enough
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:50.280]   of them.
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:54.120]   Mike Harrington, a tech crunch, told me that he thought that he heard that the pre was kind
[00:51:54.120 --> 00:51:56.800]   of cheesy feeling in the hand.
[00:51:56.800 --> 00:52:01.920]   And he and others now in gadget also have broken the story that there's a pixie device,
[00:52:01.920 --> 00:52:06.520]   which is a much smaller pre that will come out just a few months later with an actual
[00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:08.080]   keyboard instead of a soft...
[00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:11.160]   Oh, no, I guess the pre has a slide out keyboard, but it'll have a...
[00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:15.800]   It'll be more like the centro where it's a smaller screen and a keyboard right on like
[00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:17.600]   a candy bar phone.
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:19.320]   And some say that's the one you want.
[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:21.120]   Both will run the new POM WebOS.
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:23.160]   POM's betting the farm on this one.
[00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:28.840]   Would it be disastrous if they couldn't get enough to market?
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:30.800]   It seems like...
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:31.800]   Yes.
[00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:32.800]   Have you played with...
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:33.800]   Anybody played with a pre here?
[00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:34.800]   I've...
[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:39.040]   You know, they don't really let people touch them hardly ever even in demos.
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:41.880]   I've seen it close up in terms of software.
[00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:42.880]   It does look terrific.
[00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:45.880]   Yeah, I've seen it in a guy's hand, but they won't.
[00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:46.880]   They didn't let us touch it.
[00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:47.880]   Oh, there's a cat behind you.
[00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:48.880]   Watch out.
[00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:49.880]   He may leave.
[00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:50.880]   Oh, I know.
[00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:51.880]   He got in.
[00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:52.880]   That's Mr. Little jeans.
[00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:59.040]   Or @Mr. Little jeans on Twitter if you're interested.
[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:03.080]   I would laugh at you, but my dog has a Twitter account.
[00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:04.080]   I did not create it.
[00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:05.520]   You don't let our cat near the Twitter.
[00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:06.520]   No.
[00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:10.400]   I had a caller on the radio show today saying, "My cat was sleeping on my Lenovo keyboard
[00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:15.040]   and now the backspace delete and enter key won't work."
[00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:18.440]   I said, "You didn't sit on the cat while I was on the keyboard.
[00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:19.440]   Did you?
[00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:20.440]   A little something came out there?
[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:21.440]   What happened?"
[00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:25.160]   Anyway, we don't know what the story is on that one.
[00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:26.840]   I think we agree.
[00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:30.280]   The pre is very important for Palms' continued survival.
[00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:34.720]   There's a huge amount of anticipation with this device.
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:39.160]   I think if they don't deliver big very early, people are going to start calling it as a
[00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:40.160]   failure.
[00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:45.000]   That's really depressing to me because it could do well over time, but people are so
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:48.760]   looking forward to seeing how it does right away, right off the bat and comparing it to
[00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:52.400]   the success of the iPhone when it first came out.
[00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:54.040]   There's a lot of anticipation there.
[00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:55.040]   A lot of...
[00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:57.040]   I don't know.
[00:53:57.040 --> 00:54:00.920]   Palms definitely went on a limb with this and the reception so far at least when we
[00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:04.200]   saw it at CES for the first time was very good.
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:09.120]   I hope if they can meet up with demands, it'll continue to go along on that positive
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:10.120]   route.
[00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:11.120]   I'm going to get in line.
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:12.360]   I'll go to the sprint store and buy one.
[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:14.280]   I'm going to get in line.
[00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:20.840]   Is it similar to what happened with the G1, which had a huge amount of hype and a lot
[00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:22.960]   of anticipation for it?
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:25.360]   They've sold a decent amount of it.
[00:54:25.360 --> 00:54:26.360]   It has not been the game changer.
[00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:27.360]   Team level says 1 million.
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:29.360]   Yeah, it definitely hasn't been the game changer.
[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:36.920]   It's going to be hard for either team mobile or sprint to change any game given that they're
[00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:39.800]   the weakest of the big carriers.
[00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:45.640]   If the crew came out on Verizon, say it would have a bigger chance at being huge instantly.
[00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:46.640]   Did you credit it?
[00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:51.560]   I said that somebody was very excited about the pre-I might switch to sprint to get a...
[00:54:51.560 --> 00:54:56.840]   I mean, sprint has really great data, but they just don't have the numbers there.
[00:54:56.840 --> 00:55:00.360]   There's not enough people on sprint and I don't know if sprint has a big enough draw
[00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:04.560]   to get people to switch over for this one device.
[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:05.560]   That's the real problem right now.
[00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:09.760]   If you want an iPhone, you have to go to AT&T, you want a G1, you have to go to T-Mobile.
[00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:11.040]   This is not good for consumers.
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:13.960]   I wish they wouldn't do this, but I guess it's good for the companies.
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:17.520]   Do you credit the rumor that Apple might be doing a deal with Verizon, putting in the
[00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:22.720]   iPhone or something like it, or maybe an iPhone light on the Verizon network?
[00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:25.000]   It makes some sense in one...
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.640]   In some ways, it doesn't make any in another.
[00:55:27.640 --> 00:55:34.240]   For one thing, if Apple were to do it now, they'd have to do it with CDMA, which doesn't
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:37.600]   have a long shelf life.
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:43.920]   But on the other hand, with LTE coming along and them swapping out phones every year like
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:49.400]   it seems that they're on that cycle, it would give them a foothold with Verizon and would
[00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:51.960]   expand their market share quite a bit.
[00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:57.280]   It's probably good for a short-term play, and then if they keep up with the technology,
[00:55:57.280 --> 00:56:00.800]   it'll do good in the long-term.
[00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:01.800]   I like Android.
[00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:06.720]   Now we're seeing a lot of news that Android's going to show up on other devices that Google
[00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:12.520]   will offer the Android operating system on some netbooks.
[00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:18.080]   I think the problem with the G1 is that it's just a little too geeky for the average consumer.
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:19.080]   Are you think that's a...
[00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:20.080]   Yeah.
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:21.080]   I don't...
[00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:23.040]   You know, that's the only thing I can think of because it's a cool device.
[00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:26.120]   It's a little bit on the large side compared to most of the cell phones that are out there
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:27.120]   these days.
[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:30.120]   Well, not once with sliding keyboards, I guess.
[00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:35.160]   But I just feel like it hasn't caught on with that regular consumer set for one reason
[00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:36.160]   or another.
[00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:37.160]   What do you think we have to do with Android?
[00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:38.160]   I don't know.
[00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:41.520]   Well, Android Cupcake with a version 1.5 is now being pushed out to the T-Mobile.
[00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:45.520]   I keep waiting for it to show up on mine.
[00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:50.640]   Rumors are really improves performance, adds nice features, including a soft keyboard.
[00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:52.640]   Maybe that's all the G1 needs.
[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:54.360]   I mean, a million phones is respectable.
[00:56:54.360 --> 00:56:59.240]   So, you know, it's a third of Apple's sales in the same time period, but it's respectable.
[00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:00.880]   It doesn't have the apps though.
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:04.800]   The development developer crowd has not come to it.
[00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:12.040]   If you go and look through the store that is available for the G1, there's not a lot there.
[00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:16.280]   Certainly, not as what's compared to the iPhone.
[00:57:16.280 --> 00:57:19.760]   And I think that that's the big deal with the iPhone is the apps.
[00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:21.680]   Developers, developers, developers.
[00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:23.720]   They've got 35,000 apps.
[00:57:23.720 --> 00:57:25.200]   They've sold a billion of them.
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:26.200]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:31.760]   I read a great article recently about a done by an iPhone developer, and he was responding
[00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:36.640]   to a lot of criticism about why developers haven't been creating more apps for Android.
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:40.320]   And the reason being is there's just not the amount of people there that are buying these
[00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:41.320]   applications.
[00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:46.200]   I mean, so many rabid fans of iPhone applications were just downloading apps constantly from
[00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:47.800]   the iTunes app store.
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:51.200]   They're not getting that same kind of response with Android and with the G1.
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:55.400]   So, obviously, it makes more sense for them to focus their attentions on something like
[00:57:55.400 --> 00:57:58.680]   the iPhone apps as opposed to doing it for Android.
[00:57:58.680 --> 00:57:59.680]   Yeah.
[00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:00.680]   Yeah.
[00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:03.760]   So, whatever platform gets the most apps is going to win.
[00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:06.480]   And that's why Windows for so long beat Macintosh.
[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:13.320]   If you get the developers behind you, you're going to have an advantage in the marketplace.
[00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:18.000]   Let's talk about Amazon just bought Stanza speaking of iPhone.
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:24.080]   And Stanza is the best e-reader, much better than Amazon's own Kindle e-reader on the iPhone.
[00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:29.280]   And it's an interesting choice to buy Lex cycle, which is the company that makes Stanza.
[00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:30.880]   Do you use Stanza of Veronica?
[00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:32.040]   It's a really good e-book.
[00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:36.760]   No, I didn't actually, but I just bought a Kindle this week and I got it in the mail on
[00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:37.760]   Thursday.
[00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:38.760]   How do you like it?
[00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:39.760]   So, I love it.
[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:40.760]   I freaking love it.
[00:58:40.760 --> 00:58:45.800]   But I downloaded the Kindle app for the iPhone and I haven't used it yet.
[00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:49.480]   But I didn't use Stanza before because I've always had a hard time with e-book readers
[00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:50.480]   on the iPhone.
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:51.480]   Stanza is pretty good.
[00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:52.480]   Yeah.
[00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:53.480]   It's a good, it's my eyes.
[00:58:53.480 --> 00:58:56.920]   You know, my eyes just get so strained after reading on the tiny screen for too long.
[00:58:56.920 --> 00:59:01.600]   You can pinch the text to make it bigger or smaller so you can get big fonts.
[00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:02.600]   But you're right.
[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:03.600]   I mean, it's not as good as the Kindle.
[00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:04.600]   So you like the Kindle.
[00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:05.600]   I absolutely.
[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:06.600]   You're so happy with it.
[00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:07.600]   You freaking like it.
[00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:08.600]   I freaking love it.
[00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:09.600]   You know, it's funny.
[00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:10.600]   We're escalating.
[00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:11.600]   I don't know.
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:12.600]   It's Frank Worsenfrit.
[00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:21.520]   I saw some stats that said that more than half of the Kindle buyers are over 50 and a
[00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:23.920]   third of them are over 60.
[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:25.440]   And I wasn't surprised at all.
[00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:31.680]   I showed my 75 year old mom my Kindle and she said, I've got to have this because the
[00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:34.080]   font, the text size, you can get it big enough.
[00:59:34.080 --> 00:59:35.080]   And she can read.
[00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:36.520]   She said, I'd stopped reading because I couldn't.
[00:59:36.520 --> 00:59:41.320]   The text was too small on printed books and she loves the Kindle.
[00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:44.320]   She loves it that she can order a book and it appears there.
[00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:45.320]   She loves the formfishes.
[00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:46.320]   She's getting one.
[00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:47.320]   I won't.
[00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:48.320]   I hope she's not listening.
[00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:49.320]   She's getting one for Mother's Day.
[00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:50.800]   Oh, what a guy.
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:52.360]   That's a good gift for Mother's Day.
[00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:54.240]   Yeah, she really likes it.
[00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:55.240]   So that's interesting.
[00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:59.920]   The Kindle's audience is not the young hip kids.
[00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:01.320]   It's pretty expensive.
[01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:03.280]   That's for a young hip kid.
[01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:04.440]   I guess so, yeah.
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:07.320]   It's the cost of entry level laptop.
[01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:08.640]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:11.480]   But hey, look, Veronica Balm.
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:12.960]   And she freaking loves it.
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:15.960]   I had to sell part of my kidney.
[01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:16.960]   But you're young.
[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:17.960]   You can afford that.
[01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:19.560]   You got an excellent.
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:26.440]   Has there been any word if Amazon is going to replace its Kindle app for the iPhone with
[01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:27.440]   the Stanza app?
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:28.760]   No, but you've got a thing to add.
[01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:31.200]   I'm sure they'll probably integrate it, huh?
[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:32.200]   It probably is.
[01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:35.320]   I like the iPhone app for Kindle.
[01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:40.840]   I've read a couple of books with it and it doesn't bother my eyes that much.
[01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:42.520]   But the font is very nice.
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:47.840]   It's the same font that the New York Times uses on its app, which is also very readable.
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:48.840]   And I like it.
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:52.000]   I don't have a Kindle, but I've bought a couple of books.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.640]   Download Stanza and see what you think.
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:59.160]   What do you think is it stands at a blog post saying they had no plans to make any change
[01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:02.280]   to the app or add new sources of content.
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:07.880]   And if they're owned by Amazon, how can Amazon not essentially replace Kindle for the iPhone,
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:11.000]   which is not that great with Stanza, which is so much better?
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:12.000]   Interesting.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.000]   Yeah.
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.000]   I think they must.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.000]   That must be the plan.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:16.000]   The other advantage is Stanza's worldwide, right?
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.440]   You could buy Stanza anywhere.
[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:20.480]   It would let Amazon, it would open up a mark.
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:25.840]   Well, maybe they don't want that global market because of the publishing rights issues.
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:29.200]   But it would open up, you know, everybody could use it.
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:30.200]   It's a much better reader.
[01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:33.440]   The big thing about the Kindle app, the only advantage the Kindle app has is that when
[01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:36.960]   you read on the Kindle app, it updates your Kindle and vice versa.
[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:41.920]   So when you get to page 69 on the Kindle, it's suddenly page 69 on the Kindle app.
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:45.520]   That's all I'd have to add to Stanza and that and one more source, Amazon.
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:47.080]   It wouldn't be a big change.
[01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:49.600]   So what do they say that, Erid?
[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:51.040]   They say that after the sale?
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:55.160]   Yeah, after the sale, there's a blog post saying essentially they have no plans for changes,
[01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:56.160]   but who knows?
[01:01:56.160 --> 01:02:01.760]   Maybe Stanza will stay the same, but they'll be a new version of the iPhone app.
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:03.480]   I'm reading Confessions of a Shopaholic.
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:05.400]   Oh, that's a great book.
[01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:06.400]   That's a great book.
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:10.200]   But to have you read it like a lot on the iPhone, are you read a lot of pages?
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:13.640]   No, I just downloaded it just a second from my Kindle.
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:16.560]   Well, I just downloaded Mist, but you don't see me playing it.
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:19.160]   By the way, I just wanted to show you what it looked like.
[01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:23.600]   But yeah, well, I'm sure you're not reading during the show.
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:25.360]   No, I wouldn't do that ever.
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:29.520]   I am playing Mist, however, nor have I ever played a lot of Warcraft while on the show.
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:31.240]   I've never done that.
[01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:32.240]   Really?
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:34.880]   The way you say it makes me think you have.
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:36.520]   Are you playing World of Warcraft?
[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:39.600]   No, no.
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:42.080]   You got the 71 I saw.
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:43.920]   No, I'm at 80 now.
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:44.920]   You got to 80?
[01:02:44.920 --> 01:02:45.920]   I got to 80.
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:47.520]   That's as high as you can go, right?
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:48.520]   You can go.
[01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:49.520]   Yup.
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:50.520]   Leveled out.
[01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:51.520]   Yeah, I'm sad.
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:54.520]   I don't want to talk about it anymore.
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:56.320]   It's just depressing.
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:58.320]   Level 80 Vixen Warrior.
[01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:02.360]   Ooh, no, I am a Torin shaman for the Horde.
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:04.120]   Torin shaman for the Horde.
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:05.120]   For the Horde.
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:06.120]   Such nerds.
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:07.520]   Moving on.
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:09.000]   So sad.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.960]   Just two losers sitting here.
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:13.720]   I just totally rathold us, didn't I?
[01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:14.720]   No, I love it.
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:19.360]   First of all, I love ratholds, but I love talking about World of Warcraft.
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:22.200]   It's completely appropriate since I'm now going to play Mist.
[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:24.360]   773 megabytes.
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:25.360]   Was that done?
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:26.360]   Wow.
[01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:30.360]   It only takes, I say, 100 megabytes on the phone, but you need a free 773 to install it,
[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:31.360]   I guess.
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:34.200]   I wonder how long this is.
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:36.200]   This sink will take.
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:37.200]   Oh, boy.
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:40.160]   But then you have Mist on your phone, so that's awesome.
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:42.080]   Yeah, I can't wait.
[01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:45.280]   Before the show's over, I'll boot it up and we'll take a look at it.
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:47.960]   We're going to take a break, come back.
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:50.960]   I would like your impressions of the DVD copying trial.
[01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:54.480]   This is a big, big story which we have not yet covered.
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:57.280]   It's happening in San Francisco right now in the Ninth Circuit Court.
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:01.600]   It's Judge Marilyn Patel back to her old tricks.
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:04.560]   Go Daddy says, don't buy dot TV.
[01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:11.880]   The island is sinking and Windows 7 comes out Tuesday and release candidate 1.
[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:14.720]   Supposedly, the only release candidate.
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:19.760]   Before we do all of that, though, I do want to mention our friends at Citrix and go to
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:22.520]   meeting.
[01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:24.000]   Is anybody here used go to meeting?
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   Just you can be honest.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000]   You don't have to.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000]   Yes.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.560]   What do you think, Dwight?
[01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:29.880]   I liked it.
[01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:30.880]   I wasn't driving.
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:34.200]   It was for a meeting at work, but it worked quite well.
[01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:35.200]   I'm using it more and more.
[01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:39.120]   We just asked for a few accounts for some of our hosts who are using it actually during
[01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:42.800]   the show to show screens, which is very cool.
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:45.080]   You said you've used it too, Harry?
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:50.680]   No, a fairly significant percentage of the demos people do for me these days are done.
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:51.680]   Yes.
[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:53.160]   Everybody's moving to go to meeting.
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:54.880]   Go to meeting from Citrix.
[01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:58.800]   They're the company that does go to my PC as well.
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:02.160]   They really know the ins and outs of Windows and how to do remote access.
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:08.760]   I don't think there's anybody better, frankly, at remote access than the Citrix folks.
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:09.760]   Go to meeting.
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:11.760]   Basically, here's the problem.
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:13.680]   You're on a conference call.
[01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:18.000]   You're talking to somebody and you're showing them something visual.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:22.720]   You're talking about something visual, a PowerPoint or a keynote presentation or a drawing or
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:23.720]   a slide.
[01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:27.240]   You're describing it and it's just frustrating as heck.
[01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:31.320]   What you can do if you've got go to meeting install to say, "Hey, well, let me show you."
[01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:32.560]   This is wild.
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:34.520]   You go to meeting.com.
[01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:37.960]   It takes you about a click of the mouse to get it started.
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:40.000]   You tell them, "Go to go to meeting.com."
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.480]   Here's the meeting ID.
[01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:43.360]   It's cool because they go, "Wow."
[01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:46.160]   They're looking at your computer on their screen no matter where they are.
[01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:47.320]   They see the presentation.
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:51.720]   It's great for sales, great for product demos, for training, for collaboration too.
[01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:54.800]   You can both work on a document together.
[01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:59.920]   Very affordable and right now free for 30 days when you use this special URL.
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:03.160]   Go to meeting.com/twit.
[01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:09.440]   These guys, I have known these guys going back to Ed Yacobucci who founded Citrix many moons
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:11.120]   ago.
[01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:15.800]   I've always thought the world of them and their technology, it's secure, it's affordable,
[01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:16.800]   it's effective.
[01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:18.080]   Go to meeting.com/twit.
[01:06:18.080 --> 01:06:22.320]   I invite you to give it a try.
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:26.640]   Microsoft is going to Windows 7.
[01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:34.440]   And Acer, Acer will have a Windows 7 PC available for sale October 23rd.
[01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:38.600]   Somebody's going to get spanked at Acer for that one.
[01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:40.480]   But it may even be sooner, who knows?
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:43.280]   Maybe it'll be September and then Acer's just saying, "But we're going to have our computer
[01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:45.520]   by October."
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:49.240]   You using Windows 7, Harry?
[01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:51.160]   As we speak, I'm installing it on a network.
[01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:53.760]   I installed it on a larger laptop yesterday.
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:58.160]   I'm gearing up for Tuesday so I can have my hands on experience with the release candidate.
[01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:03.960]   But I've been using the early preview version since last October, whenever it was it was
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:04.960]   released.
[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:08.880]   I have 7,000, which is the preview version on a number of PCs.
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:11.360]   And then the 7100 comes...
[01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:15.480]   I'm not a member of TechNet or MSDN, so I'm going to have to wait with the unwashed masses
[01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:17.480]   to Tuesday.
[01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:20.160]   I look forward to trying it on Tuesday.
[01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:21.160]   It's excellent.
[01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:27.840]   It's in a lot of ways, and even the beta was a better product than the 4.0.
[01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:30.120]   That's got to be depressing, but that's true.
[01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:32.040]   It's way better than Vista in a lot of ways.
[01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:37.760]   My main concern is PC manufacturers don't have a great track record of making Windows
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:42.680]   look good on their machines because they load it up with demoware and junk and they replace
[01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:45.360]   the Windows utilities with Windows 7.0.
[01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:52.360]   And I hope they might do that to 7.2, and I'm hoping that because 7 is all about making
[01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:53.360]   Windows less annoying.
[01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:58.040]   I hope the PC companies move in that spirit and don't mess it up because they totally
[01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:00.720]   could if they wanted to.
[01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:07.280]   Microsoft was on top of the manufacturers when Vista came out.
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:12.000]   I remember talking to product managers who were working on Vista at the time, and they
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:16.560]   were telling me they were leaning on the HPs and Dell's and Sony's of the world not to
[01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:19.440]   crap it up as they had done with XP.
[01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:20.440]   And that's a good slogan.
[01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:22.200]   Don't crap it up.
[01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:23.640]   Don't crap it up.
[01:08:23.640 --> 01:08:25.720]   It's freaking fast.
[01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:27.360]   Don't mess with it.
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:31.640]   But Microsoft isn't in a much better position today to lecture people about not being annoying
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:33.720]   than they were even with Vista.
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:35.400]   That's a good point.
[01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:41.800]   And a lot of companies already offer ways to yank out the crapware.
[01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:42.800]   Right.
[01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:47.320]   Sony and Dell both have ways when you configure a machine bottom line to remove it.
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:49.560]   You have to pay Sony extra for that.
[01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:50.560]   Yeah, that's a bug.
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:52.760]   I think they were saying that.
[01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:53.760]   Did they change that?
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:54.760]   I believe so.
[01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:56.760]   That's like, oh, I remember that.
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:58.600]   Yeah, we were real worked out about that.
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:02.840]   We would be glad to sell you a computer that runs fine, but you would have to give us an
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:03.840]   extra hundred dollars.
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:05.840]   It was like 50 bucks.
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:08.280]   I think it was 50 dollars.
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:09.280]   Right.
[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:10.280]   If I remember correctly.
[01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:15.880]   I think that they'll end up doing the same thing they did before.
[01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:20.960]   I think that that's one of the ways that they subsidize the cost of PCs.
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:25.640]   And one of the reasons why Microsoft can run the laptop hunter's ads and people are buying
[01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:28.400]   $800 computers in them.
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:29.400]   Totally.
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:33.800]   Although, I mean, I'm worried of short-term thinking about a few.
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:38.680]   If you make somebody now, would it but annoy your customers enough eventually they will
[01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:39.680]   move elsewhere?
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:40.680]   Hopefully.
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:44.680]   I love Windows 7.
[01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:48.680]   I think this is the best Windows in a long time and I do hope they don't frack it up.
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:51.160]   Yeah, I've been using the beta on my HP Mini 1000.
[01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:53.680]   And I've really enjoyed it.
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:55.120]   It runs on a netbook fun.
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:56.120]   Yeah, it runs great.
[01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:57.120]   It runs as well as it was.
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:09:59.880]   It left me with only four gigs of space total, but you know.
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:02.800]   Well, you have the SSD drive in your mini.
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:03.800]   Yeah.
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:09.360]   By the way, I bought a Corsair SSD 128 gig SSD.
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:10.360]   Very pricey.
[01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:12.920]   They're 330 bucks for only 128 gigs.
[01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:14.560]   Put it in my MacBook Pro.
[01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:18.960]   I am loving this.
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:20.920]   Does your mini seem speedy because it's using an SSD?
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:24.160]   I don't know if they put a very, if they put it, they can't put a very good one in there.
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:25.160]   No, it's pretty fast.
[01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:26.920]   I mean, I haven't had trouble with it.
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:32.400]   Your mini costs less than the whole than the hard drive I bought.
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:36.880]   I have to say, it speeds up the MacBook, especially boot time is like very, very quick.
[01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:38.960]   An application launch very, very quick.
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:40.160]   Which SSDs did you buy?
[01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:41.160]   The Corsair.
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:42.240]   Oh, the Corsair.
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:47.440]   We have a show with Ryan Shroud of PC perspective and Alan Malvin Tonneau.
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:49.400]   And Alan is like the king of SSDs.
[01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:50.840]   He's tested them all.
[01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:51.840]   And they took they talked me into it.
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:56.280]   I said, well, I don't want to spend 800 bucks for 64 gigs for the Intel X 25.
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:58.040]   And they said, no, no, no, you don't need to.
[01:10:58.040 --> 01:10:59.840]   You could buy the cheaper Corsair.
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:01.680]   You get more space, less money.
[01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:02.840]   And it's just as fast.
[01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:05.040]   And I have to say, I've been I've been blown away.
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:06.440]   I think this is the future.
[01:11:06.440 --> 01:11:10.720]   I think what you're going to see in PC is going forward is solid state drives for the
[01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:12.680]   boot and the applications.
[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:17.960]   And then a, you know, terabyte or two terabyte spinning drive for the extra storage for media
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:19.920]   and all the other stuff you use.
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:24.240]   You don't think eventually that the price of SSDs will come down to the point that you
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:25.560]   can have that terabyte.
[01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:26.560]   Yeah.
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:27.560]   Wouldn't that be great?
[01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:32.760]   Promise, you know, they've got the price on on mechanical drives.
[01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:36.280]   I'm buying terabyte drives for 80 bucks now, right?
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:40.600]   150 bucks for two terabyte drives.
[01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:41.760]   It's just mind boggling.
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:44.480]   I would never have a hairy, you know, PC world.
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:48.560]   If I had told you six years ago, oh, you'll be able to get two terabytes for 150 bucks.
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:52.280]   You would have, you would have left at me left in their face.
[01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:53.280]   Yeah.
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:55.240]   I mean, it's, you know, it's unbelievable.
[01:11:55.240 --> 01:12:00.080]   The one dependably popular story we ever did at PC world was always hard drives reach
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:02.760]   X for X amount of dollars.
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:08.640]   And even when it was like them reaching a hundred megabytes for God knows how much that
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:09.640]   was a big story.
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:12.160]   And if you like 10 years from now, it'll still be a big story.
[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:13.160]   I just can't.
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:14.440]   I mean, yeah, 10 years from now, what is it going to be?
[01:12:14.440 --> 01:12:19.960]   You know, oh, yeah, I got a couple of petabytes running, you know, on solid state.
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:21.480]   That's amazing.
[01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:26.360]   So I don't know, go, I don't know if GoDaddy was just looking for headlines or what.
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:35.160]   But when you go to GoDaddy and try to buy a dot TV domain now, a pop up comes up that
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:37.200]   says don't buy this.
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:38.680]   The island is sinking.
[01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:43.840]   I can't believe GoDaddy would ever do anything solely for a couple of a sudden.
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:44.840]   I never.
[01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:46.840]   How dare they?
[01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:48.640]   The sink and island.
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:49.640]   Island.
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:52.440]   And what the heck it says, why choose dot TV?
[01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:56.880]   Note, but dot TV, by the way, is a Tuvalu, the island of the island of Tuvalu, which
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:12:57.960]   is in fact sinking.
[01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:00.000]   I mean, it's not a joke.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.880]   They say, no, the island of Tuvalu is sinking.
[01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:07.800]   Recommended alternatives are dot com dot net dot info.
[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:09.560]   If it goes away, does the domain go away?
[01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:10.560]   Well, that's a good question.
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:13.000]   What's the difference does it make?
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.400]   Makes a difference to me.
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:17.760]   All my domains are not TV.
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:18.760]   What do I do?
[01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:19.760]   I don't have twitter.com.
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:20.760]   I have twitter.tv.
[01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:25.560]   If twitter.tv goes away, if it sinks, I'm sunk.
[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:28.680]   It kind of sounds like a, like just a publicity.
[01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:31.120]   Yeah, publicity stunt.
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:35.680]   You could switch to twitter.at, which is for Atlantis.
[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:41.200]   Yeah, they'll give Tuvalu the Atlantis designation.
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:43.200]   That's right.
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:44.200]   Yeah.
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:46.120]   FM is federated Micronesia.
[01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:48.800]   I use AM because that's Armenia.
[01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:53.040]   But yeah, TV is Tuvalu.
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:56.640]   And it is in fact, it's just a little volcanic island that's slowly sinking.
[01:13:56.640 --> 01:14:00.640]   By the way, somebody said, boy, that's for you to worry about that is pretty coarse because
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:02.480]   I mean, what about the people who live there?
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:06.920]   No, I'm pretty sure the people have been steadily moving off for the past few years, actually.
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:08.920]   There's only a few hundred of them.
[01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:09.920]   Yeah.
[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:10.920]   That's sad though.
[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:13.560]   And I've been spending a lot of money on their TV domain.
[01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:16.240]   They got a lot of my money.
[01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:18.080]   They should be rebuilding with your money.
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:22.520]   Yeah, get some floats.
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:25.320]   Maybe they'll have their own little state in Australia and it'll survive.
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:29.560]   I just want to, I'm going to call I can and say, please, can you assign it to somebody
[01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:33.680]   else so I can buy it?
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:34.680]   They're Royal Anthem.
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:42.000]   I'm looking at the Tuvalu, I guess, I'm looking at the Tuvalu website and their anthem is
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.000]   God Save the Queen.
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.600]   Well, yeah, they're probably a British.
[01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:45.600]   Part of the Commonwealth.
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:51.200]   It's weird when you go to Canada and you're in Canada, they play God Save the Queen.
[01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:52.200]   The Queen's on their money?
[01:14:52.200 --> 01:14:53.600]   Yeah, they're part of the Commonwealth.
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:55.320]   Yeah, they don't really do anything.
[01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:58.760]   I actually had a big discussion about this with our Canadian crew because we were just
[01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:02.960]   up in Vancouver shooting and we were asked, well, we were just in England.
[01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:08.440]   So what's the real relationship between Canada and the UK and with England especially?
[01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:10.800]   And they're like, well, it's just kind of symbolic.
[01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:11.800]   We have our own parallel.
[01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:12.800]   It's not.
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:13.800]   It's not.
[01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:14.800]   You know why it's not?
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:17.280]   It's not because there's a Canadian that told me this.
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:18.280]   So I'm interested in it.
[01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:21.640]   But they know and they just weren't thinking, but there's a Canadian, the Queen appoints
[01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:23.040]   a governor general.
[01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:30.080]   There's a governor and she's got some power because when there's a term for it, I can't
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:36.440]   remember what it is, but during this recent battle between the conservatives and labor
[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:41.160]   with Stephen Harper and there was a whole thing going on.
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:45.280]   But what is the governor general or general can dissolve the government and then there's
[01:15:45.280 --> 01:15:47.040]   this weird thing that she can do.
[01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:49.440]   There's a huge argument going on in the chat room now.
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:50.440]   No, she doesn't.
[01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:51.440]   She doesn't.
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:52.440]   She doesn't.
[01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:53.440]   But there is.
[01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:55.600]   And I remember I read a whole article about this.
[01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:56.840]   Prorogue.
[01:15:56.840 --> 01:15:59.520]   She can prorogue parliament.
[01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:01.040]   She's not an elected official.
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:08.080]   She's a representative of the Queen's government in Canada and I presume appointed by the Queen
[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:12.720]   and she has this power, considerable power with the government.
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:13.720]   She can.
[01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:14.720]   That's very interesting.
[01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:15.720]   Is that weird?
[01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:16.720]   Yeah.
[01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:19.360]   But it has to be a very, well, the prime minister points to governor general or I never might
[01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:22.360]   not take it all.
[01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:26.440]   She's frackin' useless.
[01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:29.000]   Sixty percent of this is we're going to end with this story.
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:31.240]   There is a guy who wrote, by the way, a program.
[01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:36.200]   I love this that will eliminate the mentions of Twitter from this show.
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:37.200]   I encourage you all to get it.
[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:41.960]   It's a little Python program that actually goes through the whole show and redacts any
[01:16:41.960 --> 01:16:42.960]   sentence that has the word.
[01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:44.520]   Through the audio show.
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:45.520]   Yes.
[01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:46.520]   Wow.
[01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:50.000]   It redacts the words and the sentence that has the word Twitter in it throughout the entire
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.000]   show.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:52.000]   It's brilliant.
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.480]   And it works?
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:55.640]   Well, I didn't actually try it.
[01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:58.480]   It's called Twitter killer.
[01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:04.440]   And well, it's from dingoskidneys.com.
[01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:05.760]   I'm thinking he's Australian.
[01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:07.600]   I might be wrong.
[01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:11.960]   It says it's a Twitter killer, a Twitter podcast improver.
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:16.600]   Like many of you, I grew tired of listening to this week's attack and a panel blabbering
[01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:20.280]   on and on about how amazing Twitter is.
[01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:25.880]   I enjoy the rest of the show, but they have to ruin it with their incessant fawning.
[01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:26.880]   Not anymore.
[01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:30.600]   Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you, you know, he's going to do another one.
[01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:32.280]   Kill Leo's bad accents.
[01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:34.440]   That's what we really need.
[01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:36.120]   I present to you Twitter killer.
[01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:40.880]   This fabulous program uses pockets, thanks to detect mark and edit out sentences containing
[01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:41.880]   the word Twitter.
[01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:46.680]   Can you do one for scoble that deletes friend feed?
[01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:47.680]   Ooh.
[01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:48.680]   Hey, snap.
[01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:49.680]   I like friend feed.
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:50.760]   We're using friend feed now.
[01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:55.880]   In fact, we have a Twitter conversations room and we get a lot of, you know, really interesting
[01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:57.600]   comments by a friend feed.
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:00.680]   We were good in this episode with not talking about Twitter.
[01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:03.760]   Well, that's why I mentioned this that you may want this program because I'm going to
[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:07.160]   give you one last story that actually mentions Twitter.
[01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:10.240]   You know, I do that because there's a Twitter drinking game for people who are listening
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:17.800]   to the show and they're parched and I want them to have a little beverage here.
[01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:23.240]   60% according to Nielsen, 60% of Twitter users are Twitter quitters.
[01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:26.400]   They don't return the following month.
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:29.200]   No, I believe that.
[01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:30.520]   I think that's right.
[01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:35.920]   I think, you know, Twitter is a problem because it's very easy to sign up for and use, but
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:37.920]   it's a lot harder to get any value out of it.
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:39.640]   It takes you a while to figure it out.
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:43.320]   It's kind of like you either get it or you don't and then you figure that out pretty
[01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:45.640]   quickly if this is something that's going to be interesting to you.
[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:46.640]   I don't know.
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:51.880]   I think it took, I think if I look at my usage, I signed up in December 2006 and it took me
[01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:54.560]   about four or five months before I used it again.
[01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:55.560]   And then I.
[01:18:55.560 --> 01:19:02.080]   I think for a lot of people not signing up trying it, not understanding it, going away
[01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:06.440]   is part of the process of eventually getting it because I certainly tried it and did not
[01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:09.440]   know what I was doing and came back after a while.
[01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:13.480]   So I would bet even other people who love Twitter are fairly high percentage abandoned
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:14.480]   it for a while.
[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:18.560]   And Twitter is trying to make it easier to get going because originally, you know, you
[01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:22.920]   had no friends when you signed up and they are now looking for some folks.
[01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:28.120]   Yeah, that's what the suggested friends are about and why with, you know, if they're
[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:31.200]   going for the mainstream, that's why there are so many celebrities in it is that they're
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:33.080]   trying to hook you that way.
[01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:35.680]   But yeah, when you first get there, it's like an empty room.
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:38.640]   And I think most people look around and go, okay, now what do I do?
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:40.280]   And they don't come back.
[01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:44.840]   But then once they do come back and if they kind of work it and look through their friends
[01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:49.400]   and look through their friends followers, they end up kind of figuring out what to do.
[01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:52.560]   But initially, yeah, it's like an echo chamber.
[01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:53.560]   There's nothing there.
[01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:56.880]   Dave, why do you just finally had a search for everybody this week?
[01:19:56.880 --> 01:19:57.880]   Yeah, that helps.
[01:19:57.880 --> 01:19:59.800]   That's a huge, that's a huge help.
[01:19:59.800 --> 01:20:03.680]   Yeah, because you could search for swine flu and get a lot of content.
[01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:04.680]   And then you can follow up.
[01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:08.080]   I think that's actually better and more important than the suggested users because if you search
[01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:10.840]   for something you're interested in, you can see who's talking about it.
[01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:12.680]   Add them as friends.
[01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:13.920]   That's how you build a friends list.
[01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:15.200]   Well, another thing too.
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:19.320]   I don't think they're taking into account with the study is people using desktop applications,
[01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:23.200]   which may not reflect the numbers in the same way that web users do.
[01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:24.640]   Yeah, but only counting websites.
[01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:25.640]   You're right.
[01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:26.640]   Yeah.
[01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:27.640]   Right.
[01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:30.040]   So that probably does have an effect on this study.
[01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:35.080]   Facebook this week announced that an open stream initiative, which I thought was kind
[01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:37.360]   of interesting.
[01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:38.640]   Facebook's looking more and more like Twitter.
[01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:41.400]   I don't know if you've noticed.
[01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:42.560]   And I would love to see.
[01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:46.880]   I think, in fact, I think Facebook missed a bet a little bit.
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:50.960]   Especially what they announced only meant that it was easier for third party developers
[01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:54.880]   to create Twitter style applications to access Facebook.
[01:20:54.880 --> 01:20:59.120]   And Microsoft was there and Adobe was there and Cismic was there.
[01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:03.480]   What I'd love to see though is for Facebook to open up much more completely so that you
[01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:06.160]   could, for instance, follow people on Facebook.
[01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:11.880]   They say, "Well, we'd like to do that, but our privacy commitments don't allow us to
[01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:12.880]   do so."
[01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:16.560]   But wouldn't it be, don't you think that's one way Facebook could suddenly overtake
[01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:17.560]   and beat them overtake?
[01:21:17.560 --> 01:21:21.640]   They've got 200 million users, but they could completely put Twitter out of business by
[01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:26.840]   just saying, "Well, follow the people you're interested in at Facebook.
[01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:28.720]   Would you do that?
[01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:30.520]   I mean, would you?"
[01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:36.720]   I guess if they make better use of pages, as opposed to just having private profiles,
[01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:41.240]   if you could follow pages or got more people into interested in following pages as opposed
[01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:42.640]   to just friending people.
[01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:43.640]   That's why they're doing the job.
[01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:46.480]   That's why they're trying to do is make them landing pages where you can get all the
[01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:50.320]   information about the people you're interested in and then still be able to have a dialogue
[01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:51.480]   with them.
[01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:55.680]   So it's a little bit, there's a lot more information there than maybe you would get from following
[01:21:55.680 --> 01:21:56.680]   someone on Twitter.
[01:21:56.680 --> 01:22:01.080]   But you just have to get the eyeballs there to use that trite term.
[01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:04.000]   If they do it in the portal 180.
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.440]   Go ahead, Aaron.
[01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:10.480]   It's a total 180 because I think at least until recently, maybe even now, Mark Zuckerberg
[01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:21.600]   said that Facebook is not even from meeting new people.
[01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:25.120]   Twitter is for meeting new people and even following people you'll never meet.
[01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:31.000]   And I think Facebook has to get their head around whether they want to be about that.
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.000]   I use them differently.
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:33.000]   I use Facebook.
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:37.080]   Well, I don't use them appropriately, but I would use Facebook to keep track of friends
[01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:38.080]   and family.
[01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:41.360]   And I think it's more an informational tool where you follow people who say things that
[01:22:41.360 --> 01:22:42.360]   are interesting.
[01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:51.640]   Yeah, Twitter is increasingly for me used with search and increasingly used for both
[01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:59.720]   direct interaction with people who read me and who I'm interested in following.
[01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:06.600]   But when I go over to Facebook, I'm looking at my coworkers, my family, my friends.
[01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:08.240]   And it's a completely different culture.
[01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:13.720]   And it's kind of odd that Facebook, almost in terms of the features it's trying to bring
[01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:19.000]   in and the design that it's moving towards, is almost obsessed with Twitter.
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:24.120]   It wants to be Twitter, but it's like you said, it's already bigger.
[01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:25.200]   And it's a completely different thing.
[01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:30.760]   I think to paraphrase that 80s phrase, you ought to let Facebook be Facebook.
[01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:31.760]   Yeah.
[01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:32.760]   I like that.
[01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:37.560]   But I think they definitely have a little bit of an identity crisis right now.
[01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:42.240]   Because like we mentioned earlier, it's meant to organize the people in the real world,
[01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:46.240]   yet they see the success that Twitter is having and they want to implement some of those features,
[01:23:46.240 --> 01:23:49.000]   but that doesn't work with the way they're set up.
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:53.160]   So it's becoming a clash of ideals there a little bit.
[01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:56.440]   It's irritated a lot of users too with that set up.
[01:23:56.440 --> 01:24:00.200]   I'll be careful about the irritating the users.
[01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:04.440]   You could lose, I mean, it all comes down to the fact that none of these services are meaningful
[01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:08.240]   at all unless users pour content into it.
[01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:10.600]   They live on us, right?
[01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:15.320]   It's interesting because these are sites that are created not because it's completely
[01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:19.000]   the opposite of the Houston Chronicle or the New York Times where you go to the site because
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.400]   the site creates content.
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:28.040]   There is no content on Facebook or Twitter or dig or a lot of these sites without us.
[01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:32.560]   It's not Facebook is a weird thing too because it's really hard to take anywhere with you.
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:37.720]   It's hard to, like if I leave a video comment on someone's page, I can't tag myself within
[01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:38.720]   that comment.
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:42.000]   That video doesn't then show up in my video section of Facebook.
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:43.720]   It's like a total separate entity.
[01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:47.600]   There's not a lot of usefulness there for me in that kind of sense.
[01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:50.680]   That's why I don't create a lot of content for Facebook in particular.
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:51.680]   Right.
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:54.680]   Yeah, it's a different group of people that uses it, that's for sure.
[01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:56.360]   Hey, we're going to wrap this up.
[01:24:56.360 --> 01:25:00.760]   I just wanted to put the Twitter story at the end so that we could test this program.
[01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:04.840]   Let's see how much shorter the show is with that.
[01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:07.320]   By the way, he has a setting.
[01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:11.840]   You can also reverse it and cut out everything except the Twitter mentions for those.
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:14.320]   That's a view of what a really short show this week.
[01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:16.200]   Hey, Veronica, I'm so glad you could be here.
[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:19.240]   Veronica Belmont is the host of Techzilla.
[01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:24.160]   She does that with my buddy Patrick Norton and also on Core for Sony, which brings her
[01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:26.040]   all around the world.
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:27.040]   Q-O-R-E.
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:29.680]   You could subscribe to it on your PlayStation 3.
[01:25:29.680 --> 01:25:32.680]   Do you have to have a PlayStation 3?
[01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:33.680]   Yes.
[01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:35.960]   It's on your, it's a PlayStation 3.
[01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:37.880]   Sometimes it's on YouTube too.
[01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:38.880]   Shh.
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:39.880]   Don't tell.
[01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:41.960]   Is that illegal or is that right?
[01:25:41.960 --> 01:25:43.480]   We don't do that.
[01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:45.080]   We don't agree with that at all.
[01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:48.920]   No, bad idea.
[01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:49.920]   And I thank you.
[01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:50.920]   It's great to see you Veronica.
[01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:51.920]   Thank you for being here.
[01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:52.920]   Harry McCracken is the tech.
[01:25:52.920 --> 01:25:53.920]   Thank you.
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:59.360]   It's very, it's very a good one of you to technology.
[01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:00.360]   How's that going?
[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:03.440]   We first talked to you when you had left PC World and started it up.
[01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:04.600]   It's been about what?
[01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:05.600]   It's eight months now, something like that?
[01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:06.600]   Yeah, it's a little over that.
[01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:09.760]   I guess I like the site turns one in June.
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:13.080]   So it's almost there and it's been great.
[01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:16.160]   This is the best job ever had and I've had some pretty cool jobs in the past.
[01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:18.000]   So it's saying a lot.
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:23.000]   It's really encouraging that you, somebody can strike out on their own and I think there's
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:28.160]   a lot of reporters working for a newspaper center slowly pulling a Tuvaloo who are saying,
[01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:29.160]   this is good.
[01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:30.160]   This is good news.
[01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:33.600]   We can go out, strike out on our own, create content and make a living.
[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:34.600]   It's doable.
[01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:38.960]   I don't need to make millions of dollars for anybody to be a success.
[01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:43.440]   So the bar for being a success is fairly low and it's doable.
[01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:46.440]   It's kind of like, I mean, it's kind of what I'm doing too, right?
[01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:48.520]   We're an inspiration.
[01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:53.680]   The TV left me, so I started my own little TV station.
[01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:56.000]   I love it.
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:01.440]   Dwight Silverman is still an sustained wretch at the Houston Chronicle.
[01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:04.760]   I'm mostly on the web, so I don't have as much ink on me as I used to.
[01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:06.640]   There's no ink from the web, huh?
[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:13.240]   No, there's a little grease and a few leftover bits, but other than that, I love it.
[01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:15.720]   And you and Harry are my heroes.
[01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:20.040]   I love that people can strike out on their own and make it and someday I may end up doing
[01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:21.040]   that.
[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:22.240]   We all do it, really.
[01:27:22.240 --> 01:27:29.080]   I think that ultimately that's the future is you have this brand around yourself and
[01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:30.800]   you come and you offer that.
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:31.800]   That's what you offer of value.
[01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:34.720]   It's always been what you've offered of value, but now I think the individual is a little
[01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:36.760]   bit more valued than that used to be thanks to the internet.
[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:38.760]   I think that's really great.
[01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:39.760]   It's really great.
[01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:41.560]   Well, thanks all of you for being here, folks.
[01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:44.560]   I want to mention a concert that I'm going to go to on Memorial Day.
[01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:46.320]   It's a charitable event.
[01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:48.240]   It's May 25th in San Francisco.
[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:51.320]   It's called Let the Sunshine In.
[01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:55.640]   It benefits Christopher Rodriguez and the scholarship fund of the San Francisco Conservatory of Music.
[01:27:55.640 --> 01:27:57.440]   And I wanted to give him a plug because it's really cool.
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:27:59.160]   Christopher, it's very sad.
[01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:02.240]   He was 11 years old, was hit by a stray bullet while he was at a piano lesson.
[01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:04.280]   He's paralyzed from the waist down.
[01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:05.280]   You can read about it.
[01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:08.640]   We've made a tiny URL for you at www.tinyurl.com/crystopherradriguez.
[01:28:08.640 --> 01:28:13.800]   There's a link to buy tickets if there are any left at the city box office.
[01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:14.800]   I am so excited.
[01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:20.040]   I'm going to see Sting, Bob Weir, Mary Wilson of the Supremes, Marilyn Coo, and Billy Davis,
[01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:21.040]   Jr.
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:22.040]   The fifth dimension.
[01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:26.000]   Of course, Michael Narada Walden, because it's his foundation that's doing this.
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:29.880]   It's all at Davey Symphony Hall, Monday, May 25th, 7pm, and I invite you to find out more
[01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:35.400]   about it at cityboxoffice.com or tinyurl.com/crystopherradriguez.
[01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:37.800]   You and Ryan should come to this.
[01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:40.000]   Veronica, it's going to be really, really cool.
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:41.240]   Yeah, that sounds great.
[01:28:41.240 --> 01:28:42.240]   Yeah.
[01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:43.720]   I get to meet Sting.
[01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:44.720]   So excited.
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:45.720]   So excited.
[01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:47.360]   Well, thank you, everybody.
[01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:48.360]   We appreciate your being here.
[01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:53.920]   If you like Twit or even if you don't, make sure you go to the iTunes store and look for
[01:28:53.920 --> 01:28:56.600]   the podcast section and then search for Twit.
[01:28:56.600 --> 01:29:00.240]   There are many shows in there in the Twit family of shows, including this one.
[01:29:00.240 --> 01:29:03.000]   You can subscribe to them, download them, and listen to them automatically.
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:10.680]   We also broadcast our taping session every Sunday afternoon at 6pm Eastern, 3pm Pacific.
[01:29:10.680 --> 01:29:14.720]   It's 2,000 UTC at live.twit.tv and you can watch.
[01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:19.300]   It's actually becoming more and more of a video show, thanks to Colleen and Skype
[01:29:19.300 --> 01:29:20.300]   asaurus back here.
[01:29:20.300 --> 01:29:22.040]   We got all three of you on video.
[01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:23.040]   Look at that.
[01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:25.040]   Look at those shiny smiling faces.
[01:29:25.040 --> 01:29:26.040]   Hey, everybody.
[01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:27.040]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:28.040]   We'll see you next time.
[01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:29.040]   Another Twit.
[01:29:29.040 --> 01:29:30.040]   This is amazing.
[01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:31.040]   It's in the can.
[01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:47.160]   [Music]
