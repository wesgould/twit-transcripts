[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.600]   has dained to grace our presence. Normally you're at Mac Break Weekly on Hello Hello
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.760]   on Tuesdays but I'm so glad to see you. And I won't be here Tuesday. So you're here now
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.640]   as we move it Wednesday. That's right Mac Break Weekly you'll be on a different day.
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.360]   We'll explain why that is. And just a bit also here Alex Wilhelm from TechCrunch sitting
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.440]   in his hall. Hello Alex. The part of the matter you know your your apartment looks like George
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.520]   Clooney's apartment and up in the air. Like you do spend 12 days a year there is that it?
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.760]   No this is actually not even my house. I'm down in Sunnyvale with my family. And I'm like
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.520]   just doing two things in one second. Nice. Well thank you. I know it's Labor Day weekend and I
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.360]   appreciate you're doing this. Oh thanks for the. And we are so thrilled after I think a two-year
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:04.720]   absence to welcome back Jenny Jardin from Boing Boing Jenny. And she's sitting with Chappie her
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.400]   rescue poodle who is so happy to be there. Is that happy Chappie? We're having a good Sunday.
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.480]   Yeah look you recognize your name don't you? Thanks for being here. Anybody out in the audience?
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.880]   On Labor Day. We all followed with interest. You're you're and you were I don't think I'm saying
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:27.280]   anything out of school here. You were very public with your diagnosis of breast cancer. And and
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:36.160]   how's your health now? It's great. Yeah I was diagnosed with with breast cancer in 2011.
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:43.760]   On December 1st 2011 I went in to get my first mammogram. And you tweeted that you didn't know
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:50.480]   it was going to be anything? No no a couple of friends of mine close friends of mine had recently
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:58.400]   been diagnosed. And I was going through some big upheaval in my life and had only recently
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.280]   acquired health coverage. Wow. And thought that health coverage would be good because I love to
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:09.600]   bike and bike to my yoga classes and on the beach. And I thought well if you're gonna be on a bike
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:16.320]   in Los Angeles bicyclist you should have health insurance because people are very irresponsible
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:23.840]   about driving in LA with cyclists. Yes. And you know I thought here I am vegan. I you know run
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:30.720]   and swim and do all this stuff. People like me get cancer. So I went for my first mammogram. I was
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:39.280]   41. Just turned 41. And live tweeted it because I was more of an oversharer than I am now I guess.
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:47.920]   And you know I thought that maybe by demystifying the process I could help somebody else who like
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:57.120]   me thought that it was too scary or something. And at the end of the day I could kind of give
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:04.080]   you a blow by blow but at the end of the day I had a diagnosis of breast cancer. And my life
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:10.960]   changed a lot. And we could you know I love talking about myself especially my tragedies. So I could
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:19.520]   fill up this entire show with my tales of whoa but yeah I got I developed a real
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:26.320]   face in a power greater than myself which is called science and evidence-based medicine.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:34.160]   Right on. And you know my doctors aren't gods and there are no guarantees in our treatment.
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:40.720]   Sorry for my bad camera work I'm sitting on my phone. I'm enjoying it. It's very naturalistic.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:46.640]   I don't believe very strongly that if you're not having fun you know if you're not enjoying
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:52.560]   the fullness of life every day you know you're you're living life wrong because there are no
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:58.880]   there are no guarantees. But yeah currently I'm I'm my health status is very very good today
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:04.080]   and I'm doing both things that are fun and things that are not fun to help ensure that I'm
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:11.840]   a Romanian treatment. But my status is great right now and it's not holding me back from
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:17.440]   anything I want to do including forming complete sentences on a Sunday afternoon
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:24.320]   more or less complete with you Leo and and the handsome Alex and Alex.
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.680]   They're both. They're both. It's so great to have you Jenny and I think you're so beloved on
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:35.360]   the internet and everybody uh you know everybody forgot what a bitch I was. Ah you see you see
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:42.640]   that's what happens. Yeah so uh I'm not your friend here I'm just still the same internet bitch.
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:48.000]   Well we're all glad to have you back in in in good form. It's really it's really great news.
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:52.960]   I can't wait to talk to you about my sauerkraut. You are I see okay so I follow you on Instagram so
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:57.520]   I have been keeping up with you over the last few years and I have been watching the strange
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:04.960]   fermented objects you are making in your home. Um but but good good. We'll get into that later.
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:12.720]   It's a threat. We'll get into that crowd. We'll talk about a crowd later. You know I was in um uh
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:18.800]   where was I? I was in uh Budapest where apparently I guess Hungarians loved their sauerkraut.
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:25.040]   They don't like migrants much but they loved the sauerkraut and we went to a market and there were
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:31.600]   and there were many booze many vendors selling sauerkraut big giant bowls of fermenting cabbage
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:38.480]   and it was quite pungent but apparently it's beloved that sausages. Good good sauerkraut is
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.560]   yeah. Listen if you're gonna have sausages you've got to have some real crowd. You have something
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:47.520]   to cut the grease. Yeah. All right. Enough of that. We got a more important things to talk about.
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:53.280]   Um what could be more important? I know many many many things are more important sauerkraut in my
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:08:02.640]   humble bit. I guess we should start with Wednesday because that is of course uh you know the big
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:06.400]   event. I don't know how Apple they're so brilliant. I don't know how they make this the big event
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:12.160]   every year. You can have EFA you can have CES you can have all sorts of announcements and
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:17.840]   events and products but boy the day Apple announces the new iPhones each year that's the tech event
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:22.800]   of the year. And I think it's also the day when for all the other manufacturers they all know what
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.480]   they all try to beat it right. All the announcements predate the Apple announcement because they know
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:31.200]   once Apple announces it's I and yet I don't feel like the iPhones are technologically way ahead of
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:35.200]   anything else. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. People love them. I think that again I you
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:39.920]   know and I have a couple iPhones and a couple of Androids and the issue is I think still the
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:44.160]   iPhone is still simpler to use than the Android. I think there's a lot of features on the
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:48.720]   Android that I really like better than the iPhone and there's things that I use them for specifically
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:52.560]   but it's but it's not again it's not something that I would necessarily you know hand at my
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:57.760]   parents and say here's a you know my parents are have enough they work hard enough on the iPhone.
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:02.160]   So this segment will be the Apple segment and then we'll get it out of the way and we'll move on
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:09.280]   okay. Might as well you can't ignore it. This is so Apple has become the Brussels sprouts before
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:14.000]   a chocolate pudding. Some might say it's the choice. Some might say it's let's you know life's short
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.840]   let's have dessert first. I don't you know it's up to your up to your point of view.
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:26.560]   It's certainly true that if Apple does something it it impacts the tech community and impacts users.
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:31.280]   It's a big deal. For instance when we've talked about this a lot of the last few weeks Apple's
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:37.520]   iOS 9 when it comes out will allow ad blockers and there are a number of companies already
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:43.360]   positioning themselves to be the ad blocker for mobile Safari and a lot of people very worried
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:50.560]   publishers and so forth about it. Jenny on Boing Boing you were one of the first you used
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:54.320]   the Federated ad network. I think when you first started running ads is that right?
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:10:04.800]   One could say that Federated Media was developed around Boing Boing as a proof of concept John
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:11.440]   Patel. We invited John Patel to come in and help us figure out if maybe selling some ads might help
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:19.120]   us offset our server costs and we found out that the answer was yes and John went on to build a
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:24.240]   service that would answer that same business problem for lots and lots of different blogs that
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:31.280]   were popping up and that's what became Federated. Currently we're with another company and
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:36.320]   the business is changing a lot. The business is changing a lot and it's
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:44.560]   I don't think I'm sharing anything exclusive in saying that a lot of independent publishers are
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:51.360]   really having to rethink what they do and what matters and what kinds of possibilities are out
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:57.200]   there for doing things other than banner ad based businesses. You could argue that Boing Boing does
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:01.280]   it right? I mean if we look at Boing Boing right now there's a banner ad at the top.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:08.480]   There's a couple of block ads. There's three or four units on the whole page. It's not annoying,
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:15.120]   it doesn't there's not a takeover, there's not pop-ups and then pop-unders. It's exactly what a
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:22.240]   reasonable ad supported page should have. Unfortunately very few pages anymore do it as
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:28.160]   in unobtrusively and as simply as simply. And who knows? You know the wildest coincidence could
[00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:36.480]   happen and you know mere days after this show we might launch a slight upgrade to our design.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:40.400]   Who knows what could happen on the internet? Are you hinting something?
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:49.120]   You never know what's going to happen on boingboing.net on a day soon this week. I actually like this
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:54.320]   that this is a relatively recent redesign. It's already isn't it? Yeah. And you're going to
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:12:01.040]   okay well see what happens. Some have said that if add block ellipse happens which is what I'm
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:06.880]   calling and it's not it's not very felicitous but it's if it does in fact seem that people are
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:12.400]   as they are I think starting to widely use ad blockers. That one way to completely defeat that
[00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:17.360]   would be to take these simple banner ads. It's an ad for vodka that I'm seeing at the top of Boing Boing
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:22.080]   making an image served by Boing Boing. It wouldn't be blocked by an ad blocker. It'd be part of the
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:29.120]   pages content. Right. The problem is that this that as almost all ads come from third party ad
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:36.960]   ad services. And I think that what what makes it hard is the kind of trajectory based advertising
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:41.520]   which is just that you know we have a profile of the user and we're going to put in whatever
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:47.040]   they last saw on B&H or Amazon or whatever. When I buy something I'd say around it. I see
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:52.000]   it's for it. And I already bought that mixer. I don't need that again. Right. But the but you know
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   so so those types of ads I think may have a lot of trouble which of course is more of an issue for
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.080]   Google. I think the I think when you have a specific sponsor for a specific blog or or for or the
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:06.400]   kind of things that you have here you know it's what I think that that those there's lots of ways
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:11.840]   of embedding that into the you know into what's going on. It's it's kind of the the random stuff.
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:15.520]   I think that's harder to maybe what ends up getting fixed. Now the reason that these are served by
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:21.520]   ad networks is because the ad network wants to know well at the very minimum how many people saw it.
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:26.800]   Yep. But they probably would also like to know more about who saw it as much as they can determine
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:33.520]   age demographics. You know income that kind of thing. And by combining information from a variety
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:39.360]   of sites plus information provided by users unwittingly. Well you get much more personalized.
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:43.600]   I mean like every ad I see now every display ad I see is something that I'm definitely interested
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:48.080]   in. But it's but it's stuff that it's it's a little I almost like the last I almost don't
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:51.760]   want to know anything about me. I don't want to see an ad and don't oh I like that. That feels
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:55.200]   dirty. I almost like when they're random that I can ignore them more easily and just move on.
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:14:01.040]   You know. I have to do anything to encourage this vodka ad. So I'm assuming that one point
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:08.160]   does not know who I am. However I don't find it obtrusive. I'm going back and forth on this.
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:15.680]   I look we're at we're free ad supported media. I think this is really important that ad supported
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:21.520]   free media exists. It's democratic. It allows anybody to look at it. If it's done tastefully and
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:26.000]   unobtrusively I don't think there's any problem with it. I can also see why a lot of people are
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.680]   becoming very perturbed. These pages are tripling in size. They're slowing down by a matter of
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:37.440]   tens and sometimes half a minute. Tens of seconds. I get annoyed by the just I mean I get the the
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:41.040]   you have to be imaginative to keep people's attention. But what really has me want to have
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:45.440]   an ad blocker is when it takes over the page and it's going to hold me there or you know I'm going
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:48.640]   to have to you know those types of things really become like okay now I want a blocker.
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:53.200]   There are sites you really cannot read. I mean they're just they're overwhelming with that.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:57.280]   And then there's the third part of problem which is malware injection because these
[00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:01.600]   networks add networks are very often automated and it's possible for a bad guy to buy an ad and
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:07.280]   jet flash malware before the ad network can catch them. Yeah we have that problem at Techroom
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:10.720]   sometimes we do a lot of our own ad sales but we do use some networks and occasionally we'll
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:15.600]   just get served an ad on the site that's an autoplay video or really noisy ad and then we have to kill
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:20.560]   it and they just become so annoying. People are still doing this work you know.
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:25.360]   So in some ways the advertisers have brought on this ad block ellipse.
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:31.440]   But having Apple kind of Apple's by the way Apple is just allowing it.
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:36.000]   They're not they're not putting one on your system. They're not even encouraging presumably you
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.920]   to use it but they're just making it possible. Yeah and I don't think it'll happen overnight but
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:44.080]   I definitely think that it's going to they have a couple of years before everything's blocked.
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:48.880]   That is not the big announcement however of course the big announcement will be new hardware.
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:55.840]   New iPhone probably an iPhone 6 plus an iPhone 6s 6s plus
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:02.720]   the latest the rumor mill has been pretty accurate I think as we get this close to
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:07.120]   announcements like this last few Apple announcements there's been nothing surprising.
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:11.280]   rumor mill says the new camera be 12 megapixels 4k video capable.
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:17.520]   That's a catch up pretty much most of the other companies phones are doing that.
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:21.280]   It'll be interesting to see what the resolutions are for stuff like high frame rate you know whether
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:25.680]   it's 4k at 120 frames a second or maybe it's probably all those high frame rates will probably be the
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:32.800]   same same 1080p or 720p. Do HDR video I think actually my note 5 HDR. There is HDR video I don't
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:38.720]   know if I'd be surprised if they're doing it for for this but yeah you can do HDR video.
[00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:44.480]   It takes it's a bit of it's a bit of work. They also the latest rumor is that there will be
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:48.960]   not only force touch in the new high funds but three levels of touch.
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:52.720]   Worries me a little bit.
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:58.320]   That's too much touch bad touch.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:08.160]   9 to 5 Mac of course Mark Gurman is the best of this stuff says that there will be the
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:16.560]   basic touch which is a tap. There'll be the medium touch which is a press and they'll be the
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:19.840]   heavy touch the deeper press each week.
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:27.120]   I've already see the parody video. I hope Jonathan Songaday man writes a song even before this
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:35.040]   announcement comes out. It's like the this porridge is too hot.
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:39.920]   This is just right touch. This is bad touch.
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:45.280]   Show me on the iPhone where the bad man touched you in the interface.
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:50.160]   The thing that worries me is I of course we have force touch on the Apple Watch some of the Apple
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.320]   laptops have forced touch. I never know what's going to happen if I have three levels of touch
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:18:00.160]   which isn't new. I'm not now going to know twice as much what's not going to happen and how am I
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:06.560]   going to distinguish between a medium and a hard touch and what did I just do and so for instance
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:12.480]   Mark says you could look up a point of interest in the maps application by pressing it and then
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:17.600]   force touch on the destination to give start turn by turn. But do you know that's going to happen
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:22.560]   and how would you know and I mean do you just keep pushing things harder and harder and harder
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:27.520]   to figure out what happens. I guess that's going to be a lot of learning curve for people.
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:31.840]   Well we'll see. I mean I think typically what happens is that you don't use it very much and then
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:36.640]   and then it I turned it off in the laptops because it just bothered me.
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:40.240]   Do you use it? Yeah I use it on the laptop. I find it I just don't know what's going to happen.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:44.000]   Right. I still keep on tapping the laptop just going I cannot believe this isn't moving.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:52.320]   Give me screen touch a touch screen I'd be interested. Right. Rose gold would be a new color. Of course
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:56.400]   that'll be the one that you can't get because everybody who wants to show off that they have
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:02.560]   the newest iPhone will order rose gold. So everyone will order rose gold so that I can get my
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:05.440]   black one. You don't want rose gold. No. All right.
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:12.960]   Apple will have a new TV too an Apple TV not a TV set but the Apple TV
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:19.760]   streaming box will be upgraded for that. And I'm not sure because I've read conflicting stories.
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:24.240]   Some say it'll be 150 bucks. Some say it'll be 200 bucks. Some say there are two different
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:28.560]   Apple TV boxes. It sounds like the rumor is they're going to have a cheap they're going to keep
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:32.080]   selling the one that they have cheaper so that you can always get an Apple TV. Yeah they dropped
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:35.760]   that to 69 earlier this year. They're going to they're going to soup up the one that they have.
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:41.040]   And by adding things like I think that I think that it's interesting a lot of the rumors are that
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:45.440]   they're not going to go for 4k which seems odd to have a phone that shoots 4k and an Apple TV that
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:50.960]   won't play it. They even have computers they have iMacs that will do 5k. Right. So it just seems it
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:56.560]   seems like that's an odd rumor if it turns out to be the case. I think that the the I think the game
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:20:00.560]   changer with the with the Apple TV is going to be opening up for app development. There are
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:09.600]   not just for games but but for also for education for enterprise. There are so many possibilities
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:16.240]   for what you can develop with a little puck that you can you know add a lot of features to.
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:19.280]   So I think that's going to be very interesting. Is this finally the Apple TV that we're going to
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:25.040]   care about? No. I still just don't care about it. I think the only reason you want an Apple TV,
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:30.320]   there's only two reasons you'd want an Apple TV one because you buy stuff on iTunes. Movies and TV
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:36.560]   shows or because you want to do the AirPlay from an Apple device to your screen and that's the only
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:42.240]   thing that Apple TV has to itself. Everything else can be done on a Roku or an Amazon Fire TV or
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:47.600]   an Android TV. So Apple owns that market and I guess that's why you'd I have an Apple TV because
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:54.000]   I I do buy stuff or I have bought stuff on iTunes. Leo what do you think of Apple music in its
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.720]   current state? Actually I was going to ask you what you think of Apple. But I asked you first.
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:04.800]   Okay. I don't see this is an example of something where I don't see that Apple innovated in any way.
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:08.160]   It just and they could innovate. There's ways that they can innovate and there's not doing it yet.
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:13.120]   Maybe you know we're actually all going to have to make a decision because if you turned on the
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:17.840]   three day three month trial it will expire in a few weeks at the end of September.
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:24.640]   So I turned it on on June 29th when IOSA came out and or 8.4 came out. So that means at the end
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:28.400]   of the month I'm going to decide if I want to spend 10 bucks a month to keep this. I already
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:33.040]   have Spotify. I already have Pandora pay for both of those pay for Google music. I probably
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:37.600]   shouldn't pay for all of those. I don't see any reason to keep playing for Apple TV if you're
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:41.840]   Apple music if you go into that. I don't think they've added. I mean the guys in the other in my
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:47.680]   studio and listening to the whatever it is. Beats one and uh. Beats one. Beats one. That would be
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:54.400]   worth it for me. The the I think that I still use Spotify and I'm I like spot. You know I might
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:58.160]   probably have been better into it. I don't see I don't see anything that Apple TV is giving me
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:01.200]   that I really want. There are things that I would love to see from both of these things like
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:06.240]   cross fades between songs like you know it's always a bit. So it's like Spotify do a cross
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:10.960]   phase. No it does automatic cross phase. What I want is I just want a little curve. Just give me
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:15.440]   let me let me do a little mix between the two seconds. I know but what you want is to be able
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:19.360]   to when you know your playlist on me. You know come on you're nuts. Nobody's going to want to do
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:23.440]   that. Do you mean for each individual and then you would never leave that service because you built
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:28.560]   your bill you know like you I'm just telling you that we're an ex DJ. I know but once you have that
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:32.160]   control you never give it up. I'm just telling you. So Jenny I'm going to turn the tables on you.
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:37.760]   What do you think? What do I think? Apple music. Are you going to keep it?
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:46.560]   You know I love so much of what Apple does. I absolutely love my iPhone and I've done work that
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:53.440]   I'm so proud of that wouldn't have been possible like news work with this device that I feel like
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:57.360]   the quality wouldn't have been possible with any other device and I feel like the exact opposite
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:06.960]   is true with Apple music. It's just blow chasing a product instead of something that was really
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:13.840]   designed with the user's experience in mind. Spotify does it well they don't do it perfectly.
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:18.640]   But hell I still miss WinApp so don't ask me.
[00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:26.160]   It really whips the Adlama's butt. Yeah. How about you Alex are you an Apple music user at this point?
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:31.920]   Sorry no I didn't slightly I'm actually a big Spotify fan and I'm really curious about how much
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:38.080]   room there is in the market for Beats One, Spotify, Pandora, Apple Music, Deezer and everyone else.
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:43.040]   I mean how many how many of these are going to survive? Well there's a big question because of
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:48.160]   course they really only survive at the pleasure of the music industry and any point in the music
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:53.280]   industry could just say to all any or all of these yeah. Right. It was a nice nice experiment we
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:57.360]   don't really think we're making enough money. I mean we've seen it already happened I mean with
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:01.520]   some artists pulling their music from these. Well I mean Taylor Swift I mean. But the whole
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:06.080]   industry there's no reason that there's only three labels now right is it is it down from five?
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:10.160]   Well they there's been lots of labels but there's only three that they're like they own the wall.
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:15.120]   85%. So these guys could say you know what do you think should we get rid of this stuff? Yeah I don't
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:19.680]   like it. Okay we're going to pull the plug on all streaming music services and then they use
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:22.800]   the music industry. Yeah but then where do they grow for new revenue? I mean like if you do that
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:26.800]   with declining iTunes sales and then following you know physical sales already where do you turn
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:30.480]   you know what's the third option if you don't allow for students. I don't really know if there's a
[00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:35.200]   pathway out for that even though they have all the power. I think it's no accident that Spotify
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:39.840]   and others are doing this now too has turned to podcasts and other kinds of content that are not
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:45.520]   owned by the music industry because they need stuff in case the music industry they don't have to
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:50.320]   turn off the the the spigot they can just say you know it's good we've decided to make the royalty
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:57.840]   rate 8%. That's all they have to do and most of these companies are so close to the edge anyway
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:02.720]   of not I mean Apple could keep it going just because they just say well okay we're gonna lose
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:07.600]   money but it's important to us to have the service. Well it would be to it would be to Apple's
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:11.520]   advantage if the if the industry increased their their rap. Absolutely because Apple paid everybody
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:14.400]   else out and Apple would just be you know and then there'd be another lawsuit and there'd be
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:18.000]   they'd be super something. Apple kind of didn't Apple kind of do that when it went and lobbied all
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.360]   the the record labels to say you know you shouldn't let Spotify have a free tier you shouldn't let
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:29.600]   these services have a free tier that's a bad thing. You know every musician I know hates Spotify.
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:38.640]   Yeah. Most of all of these services. Why? They the amount that the artists get back is is minimal.
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:45.120]   Less than other services? You know I I'm an art major I'm not very.
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:51.040]   Every time we see the the numbers we see the numbers with Pandora and the reason that they all
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:56.160]   pick Pandora is because Pandora pays almost nothing. Spotify is about a half a cent a play
[00:25:56.880 --> 00:26:00.800]   and if you look at an album that you might have bought that you listen to a lot you ended up
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:05.440]   paying about a half a cent. If you listen to it a lot but they got nothing for radio play.
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:09.360]   The only people who got money for radio play were the song writers performance there was no
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:14.960]   performance royalty right and they accepted that because it was of promotional value they figured
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:18.720]   well if we get airplay we could sell records that was how it used to be done and really the
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:22.560]   bands that are making money now are really focusing on tours. I mean that's you know the money the
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:27.680]   money is made by performing you're not not necessarily by selling and they do make a lot of money doing
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:33.920]   that. So I think the problem for Apple is that unless Apple music is significantly hidden shoulders
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:40.160]   above whatever you're using today it's a it's a hard sell. I'm not going to make a lateral move
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:45.120]   it's the same price if it's roughly the same service as Spotify I'm not going to make that
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:49.840]   why would add a loyalty to Apple I'll make the move. They've also kind of missed the boat I think
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:54.240]   they missed the boat on Android users who are I know Apple you don't love Android users but that's
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:59.040]   a significant number of people. There is still no Apple music for Android here we are one month
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:04.960]   left in the trial offer and they still haven't released Apple music for Android. I don't know if
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:08.960]   they're that's maybe they won't at all they said they would. Well you know it'll happen eventually
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:13.760]   and I think that there's a certain inertia that Apple has. I mean you look at like the top apps
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:20.240]   that anyone uses no matter how much fun we make of Apple Maps it's still the 12th most popular app
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:23.920]   ever. You just stand right now. Just right on the screen. Because when you click on anything on your
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:27.840]   phone you end up in Apple Maps. So there's a certain level of inertia that Apple's going to get out
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:33.920]   of this that I think that they can take advantage of and probably grow it into a medium business but
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:38.640]   I don't unless they do something really transformative I don't know how they what they have now is not
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:43.200]   transformative. It's not enough to pull people away from Spotify. Fortune Magazine publishes a
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:52.240]   survey from Adobe that some have said have called foul play on. The cable industry calls TV everywhere
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:59.760]   that's their term for internet television and according to this Adobe survey Apple dominates
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:06.960]   internet television with 62 percent of the market share on iOS Mac and Apple TV. 18 percent the next
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:14.080]   largest chunk for Windows PCs only 9 percent Android 7 percent Roku and down down down after
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:21.520]   that. In other words according to this study from Adobe it has paid authenticated streaming
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:29.920]   not clear. I mean that would be HBO go HBO now show time not clear if that includes Netflix.
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:35.200]   It's definitely not YouTube. I'm assuming this is not ad supported this is people actually paid.
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:38.560]   Right. So it's kind of hard I don't think that's Apple's to apples because I mean there's a lot
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:44.480]   of revenue being generated by the ad supported networks but but I think Apple always has the
[00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:49.600]   majority of paid users. It just shows you that Apple TV is despite its applications as well.
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:53.440]   Right. I mean it's a true for apps and all sorts of content so that it's this big of a disparity.
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:58.720]   I don't think it's surprising the slightest. It's just that Apple TV is not is I mean it's
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:04.960]   still a hobby I think and yet because but between it and iOS total dominance for Apple in the
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:12.080]   paid streams. Well I buy I mean I I have a lot of movies on on my iOS yeah on my iOS slash whatever
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:17.360]   and a lot of it has to do with the fact that I fly a lot and so you know all the download them
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:21.040]   you don't want to stream. Yeah I just buy them and I and I don't rent because every time I rent
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:25.920]   I never watch them in the in the window. Right. Like always the worst thing is what's half a
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:33.920]   movie than it expired yeah so so I never know. So I just I just buy them. I don't go to the
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:38.720]   theater anymore. That's my argument. Well we'll do our we'll start our live coverage at 9.30
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:45.200]   9.45 there about Wednesday morning September 9th. I will not be here. I'm flying back East on
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:51.760]   Tuesday night for the IAB up fronts. We're I guess pitch. I don't know what it is some advertising
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:59.680]   but some I don't know what it is. Actually it's a big deal for podcasting and it really is kind of a
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:06.720]   kind of a watershed moment for podcasts up fronts. The networks have had up fronts for years. They
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:11.440]   get all the new shows together. They get the stars and the new shows together. They get them in the
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:18.160]   room with the big advertisers and they say okay you want to buy a year worth of ads on heroes it's
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:26.320]   going to be huge. They sell a year ahead of time a year up front in effect. I this isn't you
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:31.200]   there were the new fronts that happened with YouTube not so long ago. Same idea. I don't know how
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:37.040]   successful those were. This is as far as I know the first podcast up fronts. So I'll be there
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:42.320]   instead of at the Apple event but we'll be covering it live at 9.45 and then right after
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:47.520]   a Mac break weekly. Will you be here for that? I'll be here for both good. Thank goodness somebody
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:54.160]   will be. And it's always interesting. It's a well how does Apple do that? What do you think Alex?
[00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:59.520]   How does Apple get all that attention? I think the proper point is that the devices are just
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:03.760]   better. I mean Apple hardware isn't in my experience just such a more superior product that we all
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:08.480]   get excited. Is that still true? I don't think Samsung I think it is. I mean I think Samsung feels
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:12.880]   every Apple event they just have to watch Apple beat them. You know again. I know. And so I think
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:17.360]   it's going to be dispiriting for the larger industry but I mean fundamentally if you look at the media
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:21.520]   and you talk to them they're nearly all on iPhones still. And so I think that mind share that Apple
[00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:27.280]   controls. You know guides coverage and therefore they just get more total attention paid to them.
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:31.280]   How much of that is inertia though? I mean I know I'll grant you that was true for so many years.
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:36.160]   Okay. I'm sure that is inertia. I think some of it's inertia but I also think that it
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:41.040]   that Apple has a lot of discipline. I mean I think the issue that you have with a lot of the other
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:44.320]   manufacturers they're releasing phones year round. I mean and there's a thousand phones and there
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:47.840]   are a thousand different sizes and they've released four at the same time and they're all slightly
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:52.640]   different. And you can't I you I don't understand how anyone could pick an Android phone in a Verizon
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:56.240]   store because or you know T-Mobile's or because it's just so many of these you have to go you
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:32:00.240]   have to take you hours to figure out which one is the one if you're not really you have to really
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:04.080]   be an expert to figure out exactly the one that you want or you just give up and buy something
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:07.040]   you know just buy something. And so I think that's the trouble that they have is that there's nothing
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:12.240]   stands out. Apple only does it once a year. Shana you're a self-proclaimed Apple fan is that is the
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:22.080]   attention Apple gets at these events merited. Well you know I it's so fun covering them.
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:26.400]   Like it's just always been kind of fun. You know what that's that's the truth isn't it.
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:35.040]   There's the there's a truth. It's a fun spectacle and look I I use Apple products because they don't
[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:43.040]   get in the way of my work. And they for so long placed usability and good design
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:51.440]   above all else. And I think you can't fake good design. And I think there's a reason that a lot of
[00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:59.120]   designers find themselves oriented towards Apple hardware. Yeah it's it's beautifully made.
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:08.080]   And it tends to just work. You know and like the events are just they're beautifully staged
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:14.160]   they're beautiful theater. It's it's a it's the gold standard of corporate theater. And I don't say
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:21.200]   that in a mocking way. No I think you're right. And you're just phones man. Like yeah they're
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:27.600]   phones. Why not. And we use them every day all the time and they become our interface with the
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:33.280]   world and with everything that we love. The design of your phone matters. What other thing
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:38.880]   are you going to hold that much and use for that many fun things. Important things.
[00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:43.520]   Mundane things. It's it's maybe the most importantly designed thing that you have.
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:51.040]   And I actually think that the the events have gotten better since really. Yeah I mean I
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:55.280]   they're a lot shorter. They're a lot shorter and a lot less BS at the beginning and they've
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:34:00.000]   actually I feel like they they move from one thing to the other in the last couple years. And
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.520]   you know we stream a lot of corporate you know large corporate events.
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:08.480]   Got dreamers coming up. Next yeah a couple weeks. And so you we sit in the back and I don't think
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:12.240]   anybody has any idea of how much work it takes to do something like what Apple does.
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:16.320]   Apple's been rehearsing in all likelihoods. The last two weeks already. At least.
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:21.440]   At least. Two weeks are you kidding? Yeah once. And and so they they have you know they'll be
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:26.480]   I you know I were not involved in that one but but the but in the ones that we have though a lot
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:31.120]   of the ones we work on they'll be rehearsing for months when they get up there there once they're
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:36.560]   on stage with all the gear up there they're going over and over for days you know you know
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:40.800]   rehearsing it to get every last little bit like oh the mouse was a little bit here let's speed
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:44.480]   that up a little bit you know it's it's really I'm guessing they couldn't get Jimmy Iovine and
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:48.720]   Drake to the rehearsals last time. Every time you see one of those events and it's a little rough
[00:34:48.720 --> 00:34:52.160]   that means that those are the guys that didn't show up for the rehearsal. It didn't come and
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:56.400]   no one could say to Drake what are you doing you should have been here. Yeah yeah.
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:00.720]   I'm really curious do we still find Apple events as fun given that we generally know
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:03.760]   everything that's going to happen at a time because I feel a few years back you know there was a lot
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:07.520]   more mystery and intrigue to them. Yes. Whereas now we've got Mark Gurman and he goes you know the
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:11.360]   downblood let me just watch him re-announce it so do we care as much or is it less interesting?
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:14.960]   I think for the last two years it's been there haven't been any surprises either.
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.920]   Every once in a while there's a little bit of you know something went one way or the other or
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:21.840]   something doesn't show up I think we all expected an Apple TV at WWDC and didn't see it.
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:25.680]   Yeah you always want that one more thing Steve you know I have to say I don't think they've been
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:29.200]   as good since Steve passed. The one more things have not been as good.
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:34.480]   No that's just the whole thing. Steve was a master at this and even when he was deathly ill
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:41.920]   he was a master and I don't I don't think Tim Cook or Phil Schiller or Eddie Q have the kind of same
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:47.840]   kind of charisma and excitement to watch. I honestly feel like Apple is coasting a little bit on those
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:53.520]   great days. Oh maybe. I mean I think that I mean I wouldn't say coasting I mean the last time
[00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:58.080]   they released an iPhone it was it did okay. I don't know if that's coasting. But see people
[00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:03.120]   often conflate sales with innovation and brilliance and all that's just sales.
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:08.160]   You can make a lot of excuses for why it's selling so well windows sold really well in the 90s
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:12.080]   didn't make windows a great operating system. In fact it still sells pretty well.
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:17.920]   Sales are not the measure of whether this is exciting or interesting or innovative.
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:24.080]   Oh wait it's a shade at Microsoft and Apple. Hey I'm good at that. I throw shade at the whole
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:30.400]   industry. So I guess my I think that what Apple is not so much innovate what they innovate with is
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:36.400]   in a place. You get a little tag on your shirt. It's cool I like it. That's stupid.
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:43.920]   So anyway but the I think that what Apple does is not that they innovate well is that they say
[00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:49.200]   no really well. They say no to certain things. That's you know and and and they are very very
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:53.200]   good at saying okay we're not going to do this. We are going to do this and they're good at
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:58.320]   creating something that that again just works that's fairly simple. And when they you know there
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:02.080]   are definitely places like I think I think Apple music is not that. I think it's a whole lot of
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:06.880]   yes to a whole lot of things that I don't understand. But but I think that for a lot of times what
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:11.040]   they're really good at I mean these other a lot of their competitors say yes to everything.
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:14.720]   And they make a version of everything. That's how someone does business. It's confusing though. I
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:20.000]   mean it's for their market. It's they've actually learned. It's overwhelming. They really feel like
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:26.080]   I feel like that's why Apple music isn't up to snuff because it appears to have been designed
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:30.800]   with the opposite the opposite thinking. That really didn't think opposite.
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:35.680]   Yes. The opposite thinking. Do you know what I mean? Yes. No it was it was like a me too. It was a
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:40.080]   me too product and like I had more features than the other one has. You know I think that was the
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:44.240]   the issue that I don't think it went it went bloated instead of being
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:50.160]   narrowly focused and and just so. But you know that's the iTunes story from day one.
[00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:55.120]   Exactly. It's just this constant disastrous expanding software. You think they would have
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:58.800]   learned from that because iTunes is not kind of a running joke in textbooks about how bad it is.
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:02.000]   But Apple music they didn't really apply those the same lessons I don't feel.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   Is it the case that Apple's really good at hardware and not so good at software and services?
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.200]   Is that really what it is? I think they have a hard time understanding.
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:15.280]   We know they don't do bullet services. So this event is at a 7,000 seat auditorium.
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:22.080]   The bill is very huge. I wasn't invited. Neither was I. Do you usually get invited?
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:26.080]   Yeah. Oh well I never get invited. So it's no big deal. I've never gotten invited.
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:31.600]   I think I probably just screwed my chances of ever being invited back. No you love Apple.
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:39.360]   Apple. Aren't you feeling pretty bad right now that you did not invite Jenny? You've got 7,000 seats.
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:46.960]   Are you saying that she's 7,001 in your heart's apple? It's okay. No. I mean at the end of the day
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:54.960]   it's a it's a product. I use the product so I'm biased in that respect. But I this isn't like
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:59.920]   universal health care. Like it's okay if they don't invite me. I'm still going to use their product.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:05.200]   I'm trying to figure out what they're going to use 7,000 seats for. It may just be more Apple
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:08.560]   employees. That's one thing that's always been kind of I know I've talked to Apple employees.
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:12.560]   They sometimes are sad they don't get invited to these events. They're stuck watching a big screen
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:18.240]   in Cupertino or maybe nothing at all. Hey you know you don't want it to be empty. What you don't
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:24.560]   want is 500 people in the front and then 6,500 empty seats in the bag. Right. So they'll fill it.
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:28.560]   Do you think they're going to give everyone an iPhone? Is that what it's about? No. It's not
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:34.960]   Oprah. Come on now. And you get an iPhone. Oh yeah. Starting in 2017 they won't be doing these.
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:40.640]   Well I presume they won't be doing these outside the Apple campus. This is a great this is the new
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:45.840]   drone video. In fact they did a really nice job bringing Steve Jobs presentation to the Cupertino
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:52.320]   City Council for this new Apple campus together with the latest of video drone video from the Apple
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:59.280]   campus. And I jumped to the middle because they're about to show where the new meeting spot will be.
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:05.280]   This is the auditorium that Apple's building. It will all be underground. Notice no windows.
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:11.680]   This is where you'll be going in future for iPhone events, iPod events and when Apple announces
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:20.880]   its car. The events. Yes this is the auditorium's entrance. Wow. And you'll go down. It'll be like
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:25.760]   kind of like the fifth Avenue Apple store where there's a big glass entrance and you'll go down
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:33.200]   into this pit. That's wild. Pretty cool looking. By the way props to the guy who has been doing
[00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:39.920]   these because it's really fun to watch as this campus evolves. It is a massive instruction project.
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:43.840]   I have to admit I've wrecked so many drones now that I look at these and I'm like I can't believe
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:48.720]   we just did that over the people. Yeah. I mean they start in fact you can see at the beginning of
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:54.480]   the event here's Steve presenting to the Cooper T. N. S. City Council. We bought that and we
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:41:01.040]   bought some adjacent property. We used to be apricot trees. Apricot orchards and we've got
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:05.040]   about this was one of the last public appearances Steve ever made. He was very ill.
[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:13.280]   They they start these drones up from outside the fences and then they fly up.
[00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:20.880]   Here we go. They fly up and over the fence. I'm shocked that somebody from Apple hasn't shot this
[00:41:20.880 --> 00:41:30.320]   drone down. The new drone laser cannons would be perfect for the roof of the cappuccino apple
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:35.600]   complex. There are tools. 40,000 employees will all be housed in this one building.
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:41.120]   There's a four-story parking structure underground but it's not big enough to hold all the cars so
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:45.600]   there's an external four-story parking structure as well. I'm sorry it's two stories underground,
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:52.640]   four stories above the ground. Pretty impressive. Yeah. All right let's take a break. We come back
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:57.280]   lots more to talk about. We've got Alex Wilhelm here from TechCrunch. Great to have you.
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:42:01.360]   Sometime you got to come up here. Well you were up here last time. I was up here about a month ago.
[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:05.440]   Yeah that's right. That's right. Love having you up here. If you ever want to come back and
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:09.760]   be in the studio with us I'll make sure there's a I don't know what do you drink. Last time I drink
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:14.240]   tequila on the show. There'll be a tequila waiting for you. Okay that works for me. You like salt?
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:23.600]   Only if you're buying. Yeah salt's on me. Jenny Jardin from Boing Boing. So great to have you
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:29.680]   batboingboing.net and is Chappie still with you or has he moved on? I got bored. He got bored.
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:35.280]   He's an android user. I love it. Jenny is sitting out in her garden. I love it. We get a lot of
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:41.520]   people doing that lately. I love that. I can't wait to show you my squash. Let's see the squash.
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:46.560]   Let's see the squash. Can I? Yeah. Okay so here we are. I'm going to walk down and say oh my god I'm
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:53.920]   barefoot. It's going to be hot asphalt. All right let me see if I can turn. This is awesome.
[00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:57.760]   Did the camera turn around or are you still seeing my face? We're still seeing your face.
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:01.360]   Oh there it goes. It took a little while. Look at that. Those look like limes. What is that?
[00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:10.320]   This is tomato lemon. Oh my lemon. And behind it this is some volunteer squash.
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:16.880]   I might lose my Wi-Fi so I don't want to go too far in and can you see there's a lot of tiny
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:23.680]   baby kale and arucula. Do they allow you to do this in Los Angeles and the environs of Los Angeles?
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:30.560]   Absolutely. Well these are just braids and beds on top of it. Look can you still see? Yeah.
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:35.360]   Excuse me all kinds of ideas. There's some boxes that like planer boxes in the new house I just
[00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:40.400]   moved into. I think this is healing. Did you do this before you got ill or was this something you
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:48.160]   did after? So a long time before I did this but then I got way too far up my own butt thinking that
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:54.960]   work was more important than connection with nature. Love it. And I just find this really
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:44:00.160]   comforting. I do lots of slow food stuff like baking bread and fermenting sauerkraut and
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:05.600]   kombucha and stuff and it just just relaxes me. I feel like it connects me with something my
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:10.560]   grandma's would have done. Can you see the tiny little kale growing under there? Oh look at that.
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:18.640]   How do you like to do your kale? Wait look there's flowers growing on these squash. This is so insane.
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:21.120]   How do I like to do my kale? This is a smooth experience episode of Split.
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:27.440]   We've never had a garden tour on Twit before but I think it's about time to show. You can see me
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:31.680]   right. Urban Urban. No it'll turn around. Tell you what as you go back up the stairs let me do the
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:36.880]   ad and we'll come back with more of Jenny Jordan. Alex is also here Alex Lindsey from the Pixelcore
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:40.880]   and we're talking high tech and you know what I know Apple gets a lot of attention but they're
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:46.640]   not the only story this week. There's lots more to talk about. Next week we'll try to do we'll bring
[00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:52.320]   in some Apple experts try to do some analysis on what Apple announces on Wednesday. If they're
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:57.280]   true to form they'll announce on Wednesday you'll be able to pre-order on Friday and they'll arrive
[00:44:57.280 --> 00:45:05.600]   on the 18th. I hope that's the case. For the people who ordered at 1201 to 1203. Yeah you have.
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:11.360]   I overslept when the watch came out. Weeks. Took me extra three weeks to get one. And then this
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:15.760]   is cool. We'll get Alex to show us this. This is something that's actually going to put me back
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:21.200]   into the iPhone family because I want to use this lightning enabled camera from DXO but we'll
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:27.200]   ask Alex about that in just a bit. I showed today brought to you by stamps.com. Use stamps.com
[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:32.480]   instead of going to the post office with stamps.com you use your computer your printer to print
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:38.400]   official US postage without a visit the post office. It's not a postage meter. It's much better than
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:44.560]   that. No special ink. What you've got will work and you get you know you don't have to go to the
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:49.760]   post office. You get the postage you need always the right amount because you get a USB scale that
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:55.760]   will automatically weigh and print the postage. Whether it's for a letter a postcard a package
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:46:00.720]   right at your own desk. You even get discounts from stamps.com. You can't get it at the post office
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:05.840]   which is pretty awesome. A fraction of the cost of a postage meter too. You save at least 50%
[00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:13.120]   and no more trips to the post office. I love stamps.com. We use it here. If you are in the business of
[00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:19.680]   mailing stuff whether it's brochures or products. It's important that your mailers look professional
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:24.960]   and you know I hate that happens all the time. I'll buy something on Etsy and it comes in a
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:31.760]   rumpled brown paper squished box with lots of stamps all over it. It doesn't give the right
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:35.440]   impression. I mean it works but it doesn't give the right impression with stamps.com. All your
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:40.400]   packages look pro and your customers will like it too because if it's certified mail or you
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:46.320]   know you need confirmation they will get an email with tracking number. Postage insurance is
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:51.360]   discounted through stamps.com and if you have to fill out forms for certified mail or international
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:57.600]   customs stamps.com will do it automatically right from the website. So you really don't do
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:02.800]   any data entry on this. It saves you time. It saves you money and it looks more professional.
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:08.560]   Look there's no question you need to try it. Here's the deal. Go to stamps.com right now.
[00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:12.880]   Click the microphone. It's up there in the upper right hand corner and use our promo code TWIT.
[00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:17.440]   Watch this because it said five dollars in free postage. I think we can improve on that. Just put
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:24.560]   TWIT in the promo code there and then whoa suddenly it's on a hundred ten dollar bonus offer including
[00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:31.360]   fifty five dollars in postage. You get the scale. You get a month of stamps.com. You got to try it
[00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:37.440]   today. I'm telling you it will change the way you look at mailing stamps.com. Before you do
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:41.840]   anything else click the microphone at the top of the home page and type into it. Stamps.com use
[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:47.760]   the offer code TWIT. I need this. I got to really have to praise stamps.com because they're one of
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:52.640]   the early podcast advertisers. They've been so supportive. I don't know how many years now we've
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:57.600]   been doing their ads on the TWIT and they just it's a great company. I've always loved them and
[00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:03.120]   I'm really glad that they have been so supportive. So many podcasts are supported by stamps.com to
[00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:09.920]   be frank including ours. So thank you stamps.com. Jenny are you. Oh we lost Jenny. I think I think
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:18.320]   she wandered too far in her garden. Oh look at Jenny's yard an back from boing boing.net.
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:23.360]   Alex Wilhelm from TechCrunch. Are you are you going to the apple of an Alex? They're probably
[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:27.920]   sending who are they sending? John Constein probably right. I don't hear you.
[00:48:27.920 --> 00:48:36.800]   Oh actually didn't John Constein leave TechCrunch to go to work for Apple? I feel like he did where
[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:44.480]   Alex you're muted. Oh where we go? All those pearls of wisdom lost. I was trying to answer
[00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:50.960]   you. My why are you still talking? No, Daryl Atherington left. Daryl left. Okay. Yes. Daryl
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:56.640]   left. He's doing stuff. I can't tell you what there's Apple. Magic stuff for Apple. Yes. He's
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:49:02.640]   doing this already. He's very cool. Yeah. So John's still there. Josh. Josh I mean yeah still there.
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:08.320]   Josh is Josh and his hair dangle thing. Yes. Very much. And is he going to go to the Apple
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:11.360]   event? Who's going to the Apple event from TechCrunch? I think Matthew Pansareno always
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:14.880]   going to Matt and usually have one or two other slots. I'm not sure who we're sending. I'm just
[00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:19.040]   back up on that team. So I'll be watching the stream. If they need any help Jenny and I don't
[00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:23.840]   have invitations we'd be glad to go in their place. If there's an open one I'm taking it.
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:30.400]   But if I die between now and then you may have it. Thank you very much. We actually were
[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:34.080]   sending a camera crew down. We did this last time and we had a better picture than Apple did.
[00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:39.520]   Which I thought was nice. You know Apple will be streaming their event. What we do is we watch
[00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:45.360]   the stream and then we chat about it. Snark about it and things like that. Google changed their
[00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:54.000]   logo. They dropped the serif. Great article in the New Yorker about this. I think the article
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:50:01.840]   was titled Google shot the serif. Which is perhaps the best title ever from the New Yorker.
[00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:09.920]   The idea here is I'm guessing that Google wanted to start looking soft and kind and
[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:16.800]   gentle. It's fairly unusual to see a serif font on a logo. Is there a serif gone? It's not gone.
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:21.440]   You use it for other things but it's not something you typically use in a display font.
[00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:30.880]   So this article in the New Yorker by Sarah Larson says that the thing about serifs is
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:38.160]   their old-fashioned. That they harken to the dark ages of publishing. Of course it's funny that
[00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:44.000]   she says that while you're reading a serif font. Well that but that the New Yorker is of course
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:48.480]   actually their title font is not serif isn't it. But but the New Yorker has always been a
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:55.360]   determinedly serified. I mean you don't get more serifs than you get in the New Yorker.
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:51:03.200]   I don't think those are actually words. I can't just say anything. I can make up words. I can.
[00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:13.760]   She said the letters, the old Google logos, literary old serifs were subtly authoritative.
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:21.520]   The sturdy handsome G. The stately appealing little ooh. The typewriterish, lovable G. The elegant
[00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:28.800]   eye. The or L rather the thoughtful E. The new logo retains the rainbow colors but sheds the
[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:34.960]   grown-up curly cues. It now evokes children's refrigerator magnets. McDonald's french fries.
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:44.320]   Comic Sans. I mean people really care this much. I've never thought about anything in damage
[00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:49.920]   deck. Like she named the letters. I mean the authoritative G. What is it? That's also not English.
[00:51:49.920 --> 00:52:01.680]   I am I am in Sarah's camp. I feel I like serifs. I cannot lie. I think Google you could say is
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:06.800]   trying to look a little softer, kinder, friendlier, little more childlike with the new logo.
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:11.680]   Yeah. Yeah. I mean I you just think it's more modern material design and all that.
[00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:15.520]   Yeah. I think it fits in more what they're doing. I guess technically they did point out that it is
[00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:23.040]   much smaller evidently. You mean in K. K. The number of number of kilobytes is something like one
[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:28.560]   fifth the number that it was. And that is not to be deprecated after all because they
[00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:33.600]   imagine all the queries. Millions and millions and millions of queries a second each little K counts.
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:38.240]   So I I've been told that it is more efficient. Yeah but then they do this like
[00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:43.920]   JavaScript where they exactly. Yeah. I mean I don't know. I don't really if they're all about
[00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:50.000]   saving the K. I don't know. I'm sure that was my minor thing but the but the I feel like it's I
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:55.280]   think you were all going to talk about it for and then it will be nothing in no you get used to.
[00:52:55.280 --> 00:53:00.000]   You know it'll just be what their logo. You know if you read the Google blog a post about this new
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:07.440]   logo they spent a lot of time and I'm sure a lot of money debating thinking you know what should we do.
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:14.000]   So I think it's only appropriate that we do the same. We obsess about it. No.
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:20.560]   I mean so Verizon my corporate overlord dropped a new logo this week that everyone also hated
[00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:24.800]   and I stopped thinking about it like four seconds later. Yeah. You know I think this is good material
[00:53:24.800 --> 00:53:29.040]   to keep in mind. Like you know in a month where I've forgotten there wasn't old logo to begin with.
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:33.840]   So I mean good job Google that I think we can kind of be like moving on. Yeah you know and
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:39.680]   who sees the Google logo. I mean nobody goes to google.com anymore right. I think oh a lot of people really
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:47.280]   go to Google. Yeah I was just going to say I think it's interesting the way that people react to
[00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:54.240]   redesigns at their favorite brands or redesigns of their favorite brands. It's almost like if there's
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:54:00.240]   a brand that you don't connect to too deeply and they change their logo. I don't know if that's
[00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:09.200]   that much. But if it's a tool that you use all the time every day and you have a certain kind of
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:14.560]   a sense of intimacy or identification with it it makes you mad. It's like they moved your cheese.
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:23.760]   It's like they changed part of you. You know they moved my cheese. That's a book right.
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:28.080]   Yeah. Yeah who moved my cheese or who moved that whatever it is that book.
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:36.560]   Who cut off my damn serifs. I love John Ledger's tweet. He's the CEO of T-Mobile Verizon competitor.
[00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:41.600]   He tweeted because the new logos of Verizon with a check mark. Alex just hide your eyes here.
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:46.800]   Don't look at that. Okay no it's a version of screws over customers check data overage penalties
[00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:54.640]   check keeps all your use data check etc etc etc. This is the new logo the Verizon with a red check
[00:54:54.640 --> 00:55:02.000]   there huh. He's spent a lot of money on that. Wow. Wow. Are they getting rid of red?
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:07.680]   No the check mark's still red but I mean it looks like a font they did. Actually this is a really
[00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:12.480]   funny story to pull this up. Yeah the next one did a great post on the logo and yeah.
[00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:25.440]   I might have to put a little red symbol next to my name. I would like to say that all online
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:31.840]   brands should stop using red. It's red bad. What happens with red and H.264.
[00:55:31.840 --> 00:55:37.040]   No one should use red ever. That's a good one. That's one of the same.
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:43.600]   Ooh I love these. So this is a logo randomizer apparently that
[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:51.200]   they're called logo generator. I have to run twit.tv through the logo generator. What are we going to
[00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:59.440]   get for the 2015 logo generator? We get a splat. You can hit the random button get another one.
[00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:02.880]   Should I get another one? See what else you can get. I like that splat though. I don't know. Maybe
[00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:12.160]   we should consider a redesign. Here. That's it. Music. And what the Chanel
[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:18.240]   recycle. There you go. Traffic cone. Twit.tv traffic cone.
[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:27.040]   It just shows you how easy it is to create a new logo. Yeah dangerous. It's dangerous.
[00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:33.680]   That's dangerous. I got to write a check. This is good. The logo generator. This is at, well,
[00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:40.240]   just Google logo generator. So long. And useless URL that you'll never use anyway.
[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:48.320]   You did see that Lenovo likes the same E. I don't know if this is. All right.
[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:56.160]   At this point, we're really going too far. Okay. But here it is. This is a Vlad Savov writing
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:57:02.080]   for the Verge. It turns out the E in Google is exactly the same as the E in Lenovo. And both,
[00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:08.240]   by the way, I've decided San Serif is the way. I should knock it. I'm glad it was terrifying.
[00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:14.400]   We eliminated Serifs on the Google. I mean, the Twit website months ago, because Serifs are sold.
[00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:24.480]   Fuddy-duddy. Fusty. We use Verlog. So are you going to have Serifs on a imaginary redesign at
[00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:33.280]   Boing Boing done that? Maybe so. Because nothing's official yet.
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:39.040]   It is. Redesigning a website is incredibly hard work.
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:46.720]   I'm glad I'm proud to say that I have never had any design authority over Boing Boing.
[00:57:46.720 --> 00:57:47.040]   Nice.
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:54.320]   It's been great for my quality of life because, you know, design is such a thankless job.
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:58:01.120]   You do the best job. You can do the most perfect job. And your colleagues or your users or your
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:04.720]   funders or your mom. Oh, everybody hates change. Somebody's going to hate change.
[00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:10.400]   Are you is this on your shoulders, Jenny? No. That's what I'm saying.
[00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:13.520]   I help Mark and Corey kind of help out here.
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:18.800]   I am probably already in trouble for saying all that I have.
[00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:27.680]   I mean, that Rob guys got to do something. So Rob and Mark are really the design team at Boing
[00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:32.480]   Boing. They're both just obviously incredibly talented visual.
[00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:38.720]   They're artists. Yes. You know, Mark is a great illustrator. He designed the original Boing Boing
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:45.680]   logo. Rob just has this beautiful kind of rye British sense of humor that comes through in
[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:51.440]   these visual jokes that he makes. Did you ever see we he took like a shutter stock image of a
[00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:56.480]   keyboard and you know how there's there's sort of a trope in news that you'll take the image of
[00:58:56.480 --> 00:59:04.000]   the keyboard and shutter stock and put like the word porn over the return key. And that'll be like
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:11.760]   a safe stock art that you can use for a little about. So I used to get in fights with Rob in
[00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:18.720]   slack about this. He would like get bored one morning. And every single post that anybody put
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:27.040]   up would be accompanied by that keyboard stock art but with like answers or like hamburgers or
[00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:34.720]   taxes or like microsoft and come up with these funny things that he would take some of the
[00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:39.760]   sting out of it with a little sense of humor. Yeah. That's obviously that's just a silly thing
[00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:45.520]   that he does but that's a genius mind. I agree. And that's by the way, why slack is so popular
[00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:51.360]   because you can do stuff like that. You can do stuff like that without email. Right. Every time
[00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:57.200]   you send an email, you amplify pain in someone else's life. I bet that's really just how I think
[00:59:57.200 --> 01:00:02.640]   about it. So even if you're replying all to show somebody a cute visual joke that you made like
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:08.240]   what I was just describing, just by virtue of the fact that you're telling them that by email,
[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:11.840]   you're amplifying a little bit of misery. So everybody out there watching this show,
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:18.640]   do a stranger a good turn today and don't send that email. I'm with you. It's a nice email. Just
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:24.800]   don't send that email. Don't press us and you can write it. Don't press send. Don't you press it.
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:31.120]   I was looking at your beautiful article about Oliver Sacks who passed away at the age of 82
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:38.640]   this week. And this is the new Boing Boing layout for a long form. And it looks great.
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:42.960]   I love it. I hope you're up. Oh, good. We do too. Yeah. I hope you're not going to change that.
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:50.000]   Oh, yeah. I think that works well. Good. Yeah. I think it's really good. I love being able to
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:58.800]   tell stories seamlessly with other people's tweets and Instagrams and things that are woven into it.
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:08.000]   So instead of using these old journalism format tricks to get other people's voices in,
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.640]   we can simply copy and paste in the most transparent way. And then we've incorporated,
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:18.080]   we've woven other people's view of the world into our stories. I'm so glad that this medium
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:23.920]   exists in exactly the way that it exists today for us. I think it's just never been a more interesting
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:28.960]   time to be alive. Well, actually, and the word use of the word medium is interesting because this
[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:35.600]   reminds me a little bit of medium of Williams blog platform. I'm not sure what to call it.
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:40.560]   So it's got thought catalog for 30 year olds. That's it. Thought catalog for 30 year olds.
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:47.440]   But it has it's similar in the way that it does allow you to easily incorporate other rich in that
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:54.400]   sense. And yeah, this is very I really have. You scrolled by a little house ad that we had for a
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:59.120]   weekend of wonder, I think at some point, can I can I share about that now? What is the weekend
[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:04.000]   of wonder? Let me find the house ad first. If you keep getting stuck on this picture of Oliver
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:12.480]   sex, taken when he was a young man. Oliver sex. Am I right? Hot, hot, hot. And I interviewed Oliver
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:20.400]   in the mid 80s when he was about my age, late 50s, early 60s. And he had a big white beard and
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:26.960]   big red suspenders and hit a very jolly demeanor. Boy, if I'd seen this picture, I'd go, wow.
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:36.400]   Wow, he was a great man and really an inspiration. You know, I think Mark and Pesco,
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:44.080]   my two colleagues, Mark and Pesco really followed his work much more closely. But I,
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:51.520]   a lot of what I know about him was actually through Steve Silverman. Steve did that wonderful
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:56.000]   interview with him more than 10 years ago. And it was actually through Steve that I learned
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:03.040]   that Oliver was about to publish that op-ed in the New York Times saying, I'm dying of a cancer
[01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:08.720]   occurrence. I remember Steve told me at the time, it was like right before the book came out. And
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:13.600]   he said, you know, there's something else that he's going to be coming out about in a really big way.
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:20.880]   And that's, he'll talk in his last book about his sexuality. He came out as gay in his book. And
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:30.480]   I just, it's so cool. Like Steve Silverman has talked a lot recently about how being a sexual
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:38.560]   minority and being kind of a brain minority, there are some parallels. So he has this new book out
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:44.880]   about autism basically. And Oliver Sacks is a big reason that we think of autism
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:56.560]   not as without some of the stigma and the revulsion that people treated folks with autism in years
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:04:02.480]   gone by. If you get a chance to read his first piece, one of his early pieces, the man who
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:07.920]   mistook his wife for a hat was later turned into a great book. But the original piece gives you a
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:14.560]   sense of what an amazing person. Steve Silverman tweeted this thing the other day. We said, I
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:23.920]   asked Oliver Sacks, why sage plants have fuzzy leaves? And I've been thinking about this every
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:28.800]   day Leo because I'm growing sage down in that little garden. I think I probably saw a little
[01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:35.760]   pot of seedlings. And Oliver Sacks said, they have fuzzy leaves because they like it.
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:44.000]   That sounds like the right answer. I must say that's wonderful. Let's talk about the week of wonder.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:51.120]   Boing Boing's week of wonder in association with baby tattoo. Cool publishing company.
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:55.760]   Yeah, so our weekend of wonder, this is our first ever weekend of wonder. And it's,
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:05:01.280]   we don't want to call it words that people usually use for gatherings of tech people. We're
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:07.280]   going to call our extravaganza. I mean, it's really like, it's kind of like a cruise or a guided tour.
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:12.000]   I want to go. That just stays in one place more or less. It's at the mission in this beautiful
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:17.280]   historic place in Riverside, California. It's a little bit like the Winchester Mystery House
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:21.920]   if you've ever been there. And we're going to have all kinds of fun guests that you're scrolling by
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:26.960]   right now. John Edgar Park, Michael Boris, Mark Fraunfelder, we have Martin Olivia Olsen from
[01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:35.120]   Adventure Time. Amazing, amazing people. Scroll down on the, oh yeah, the artist Coop and Andrew
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:42.880]   Maine of Don't Trust Andrew Maine on A&E, Parity Carlo. And I think there's this really cool restaurant
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:48.320]   husband and wife team here in Los Angeles called Starry Kitchen. And they're like basically
[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:54.000]   internet punk chefs. They recently did this thing that they don't have a standing restaurant
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:59.040]   right now. So they did a pop up via Uber. So everybody knows about Starry Kitchen and you could
[01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:04.400]   order Starry Kitchen via Uber. There's a video game themed restaurant in Echo Park, where they're
[01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:10.720]   going to have snacks. And their big thing is these crispy tofu balls. And the guy,
[01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:15.840]   Nguyen Tran is his name, the husband and wife of the Vietnamese American duo. And they always talk
[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:22.640]   about put my balls in your mouth. And so there's going to be a lot of ball jokes and a lot of good
[01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:29.920]   food. Magic, there's going to be recreational lock picking. We might teach you how to walk slack
[01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:36.960]   line. We're going to lock some children in the trunk of a car. No, you're not. Why not? Maybe.
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:42.240]   Maybe. And then they can they can do the recreational lock picking to figure out how to get out.
[01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:52.080]   It's grown. We're going to have show and tell. It's coming up soon. It's September, what 18th,
[01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:58.560]   19th and 20th. September 18th to the 20th. Wow, that Boeing Boeing dot net, W O W dot Boeing
[01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:03.920]   Boeing dot net. And really each person who comes to the event is going to be the star of the event.
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:08.400]   It's not a hokey thing. If you can imagine Boeing Boeing being brought to life,
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:14.000]   isn't what I just described you basically, Boeing Boeing in real life. And like this place,
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:20.640]   the mission in there's these crazy catacombs and secret layers. And we're going to get these
[01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:26.240]   wacky guided tours of half truths, kind of like John Hodgeman does where he just makes it up. But
[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:30.640]   it sounds so fun. You believe him? Who knows? Hodgeman might even show up.
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:36.320]   Hodgeman should show up. This is this is made for. And baby tattoo does all these cool events that
[01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:43.520]   involve art and outs like lowbrow Southern California, hot rod art and stuff like that.
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:48.720]   All meals are going to be taken care of for you. And we're going to basically,
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:53.440]   you know what it's about for me? It's about staying up all night sitting on the roof in
[01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:59.040]   beautiful Southern California weather under these stars you can see so clearly out on Riverside
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:04.320]   doing card tricks and gossiping about YouTube. Only a hundred people will be there.
[01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:08.320]   Yeah, it's going to be small. Very small. I want to do a bunch of these. This is a lot more fun
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:13.600]   than chasing down display ads. I like I like this idea. And yeah, it's a way of supporting,
[01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:19.040]   of course, Boeing Boeing. It's $1,500. I want to say that upfront so people don't rush there and say,
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:24.160]   Oh, it includes your lodging includes a lot of the food and it includes a lot of cool extras.
[01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:28.160]   So it's not for a three day weekend. That's pretty good. Yeah, a lot of conferences.
[01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:31.440]   We pay that just to get in. But you're getting all kinds of stuff. Yeah.
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:36.560]   I don't think that's overpriced. But I thought I just say it before people rush over.
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:38.960]   And only a hundred people. So don't waste too much time.
[01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:40.160]   Wow.
[01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:41.600]   More than the Apple.
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:43.840]   I fall much more. Yeah.
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:46.240]   No, 7,000 people here, but go.
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:47.600]   It's kind of like says like a.
[01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:49.280]   Because we don't have the budget for that.
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:51.920]   Sounds like an organized food camp. Sounds like fun.
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:53.440]   Wow.
[01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:57.360]   We I don't want to compare it to anything because we've been to all of those events.
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:09:00.240]   Right. We love them. They are exactly what they are.
[01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:05.520]   And I think we just want to take little bits of all the events that we wish had happened
[01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:09.680]   and never have yet. And that definitely includes a lot of the weird crap that we're
[01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:12.480]   shoe who running into this three day extravaganza fun.
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:16.800]   Why aren't you? Why aren't you listed as a special guest? You'll be there, right?
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:21.120]   Yeah. I will be there. And I'm you know what I'm going to show.
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:30.000]   This is I'm breaking news on Tuit. I'm going to be bringing really cool book that I bought on
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:35.600]   eBay for 70 bucks. This book was published in 1855. Wow.
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:41.440]   And it's a pictorial guide to travels throughout California del Norte.
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:46.480]   Otherwise known as what we call California now before it was separated from Mexico.
[01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:49.120]   It was all del Norte. It was north of Mexico. Yeah.
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:50.480]   Very cool.
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:53.440]   That's going to be fun. We're each going to have show. Yeah, I might bring some of my crowd.
[01:09:53.440 --> 01:09:56.160]   And there may be several cracks.
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:56.960]   And we're back to the first.
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:58.160]   Now I'm coming. I'm coming.
[01:09:58.160 --> 01:09:59.280]   If there's going to be crowd.
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:02.800]   And Alex Wilhelm says, I'm not going anywhere in here.
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:03.520]   I'm registering.
[01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:04.880]   Oh, wait. I got to tell you one more thing.
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:08.640]   We're going to know one of the meals is at a taco shop, right?
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:16.160]   And the guy who makes the tacos also collects weird scrap metal and junk and makes these
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:21.520]   gody style sculptures. And he's got this whole sculpture garden.
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:26.960]   So we're going to be eating tacos that this dude makes in his crazy outsider art junk sculpture
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:30.960]   garden. And if that's not boing boing, I don't know what's going on.
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:33.360]   It sounds really great. It sounds like a lot of fun.
[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:37.680]   Wow.boingboing.net. Thank you for telling us about it.
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:40.800]   We were going to get back with more of the tech news.
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:43.840]   Google has an announcement on the 29th. Apparently that's the rumor.
[01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:49.600]   I could tell you a little bit about that and a little controversy over the on hub
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:53.840]   router that Google announced a couple weeks ago. Talk about that.
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:57.920]   But first, if you missed anything this week on Twitch, you missed a lot.
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:00.720]   Let's take a look previously on Twitch.
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:02.000]   This is called the no phone.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.840]   You know, it's the new phone season right now.
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:05.360]   It feels good in the hands.
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:06.000]   Good looking.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:06.880]   It is for the no phone.
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:09.680]   It runs all operating systems the same, which is not at all.
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:09.920]   Right.
[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:11.840]   Before you buy.
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:13.040]   This one's pretty impressive.
[01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:15.840]   This is the brand new Galaxy Note 5.
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:19.040]   This is easily the best looking, the best usability.
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:20.880]   I would say it's the best phone either.
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:23.200]   The new screen sabers.
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:27.360]   My question is what advice would you guys give to someone like me trying to grow their
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:28.240]   fair channel?
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:32.640]   If you've got a camera that can either zoom out a little bit or put a wide-angle lens on it,
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:37.840]   you may actually find that it gets a little less nauseating for your audience to watch the video.
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:38.720]   View is just jealous.
[01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:46.480]   Tech News today.
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:47.760]   They're sending it to preschool.
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:53.040]   The robot is being taught to learn about the world and solve problems more analogous to how
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:54.560]   children learn to solve tasks.
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:58.080]   But it will use the clouds and let the robots teach each other things,
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:00.080]   which is less terrifying than it sounds.
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:00.880]   Twitch.
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:04.320]   It keeps going and going and going.
[01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:06.640]   I don't think you want to let the robots talk to one another.
[01:12:06.640 --> 01:12:07.280]   I've had to.
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:08.720]   That's extremely.
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:11.120]   That is the beginning of a scary movie.
[01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:11.840]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:15.200]   Big week ahead, Mike Elgin, our News Director.
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:16.160]   What's ahead this week?
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:16.800]   I think I know.
[01:12:16.800 --> 01:12:21.440]   The big event this week is an announcement by Apple on Wednesday, September 9th in San Francisco.
[01:12:21.440 --> 01:12:24.800]   We're expecting new iPhones and new Apple TV and new iPads.
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:30.320]   We'll cover it live starting at 9.45 a.m. Pacific on Wednesday at twit.tv/live.
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:31.280]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:32.960]   Mike Elgin and Tech News today.
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:34.720]   Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. Pacific.
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:37.280]   1 p.m. Eastern Time 1700 UTC.
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:39.760]   Your daily dose of tech news.
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:44.000]   Before we get back to the tech news this week with Alex Wilhelm of techcrunch.com,
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:47.360]   Jenny Giardin, a boing, boing.net, Alex Lindsey of Pixelcore.
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:49.760]   Time to talk about brain tree.
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:51.840]   I want to talk to the mobile developers out there.
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:56.960]   If you've been looking for some way to incorporate online payments into your website or your
[01:12:56.960 --> 01:13:01.920]   mobile app, you've got to check out brain tree.
[01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:03.840]   Ah, may zing.
[01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:06.480]   We talked to just the other day to Juan Benitez.
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:08.720]   He's a CTO of brain tree.
[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:11.040]   And he talked a little bit about the companies they work with,
[01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:13.520]   the companies that use their checkout system.
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:16.160]   Listen, we get to work with some really cool people.
[01:13:16.160 --> 01:13:20.160]   We get to support the Uber, Hotel Tonight, Airbnb, Eventbrite,
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:21.360]   GitHub, Slack.
[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:25.840]   I mean, these are some of the best innovators out there and also some of them like GitHub
[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:29.360]   and Slack providing the platforms of innovation, frankly.
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:33.200]   To have the opportunity to work with these folks and to try to delight them is a great
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:34.480]   challenge. It's a great opportunity.
[01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:38.080]   We learn a lot from our customers and we just hope that we can return the value to them.
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:43.360]   If you think about it, I mean, what the secret sauce for Uber is the easy way to pay.
[01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:45.520]   You just, you get the end of the ride, you get out of the car.
[01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:47.680]   That's brain tree doing it.
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:54.080]   Brain tree has made payment experience seamless, easy, magical, and you can add that same experience
[01:13:54.080 --> 01:13:57.520]   to your app with excellent customer service, easy integration.
[01:13:57.520 --> 01:13:59.120]   We're just talking 10 lines of code.
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:03.680]   And they work with every platform, PHP and Ruby and Python.
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:07.520]   You know, node, JavaScript, jQuery.
[01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:12.640]   Brain tree gets you ready to receive payments quickly and easily.
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:15.120]   And they've got great support, fast payouts.
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:16.560]   So they're prepared.
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:19.600]   You'll be prepared as your company grows from your first dollar to your billionth
[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:20.000]   dollar.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:25.360]   Brain tree helping to solve the problem of mobile cart abandonment by offering the best
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:27.280]   in class mobile checkout experience.
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:28.080]   You can find out more.
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:31.120]   Go to their sandbox at braintreepayments.com/twit.
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:32.160]   Play around with it.
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:34.320]   It's a full stack payment solution.
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:38.880]   And I should really say it supports every form of pay, including, of course, Apple Pay,
[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:45.040]   PayPal, Bitcoin, Venmo, credit cards, and as new forms of payment arrive like Android Pay,
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:50.960]   it'll support those two all with one easy integration and superior fraud protection
[01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:52.640]   and customer service and fast payments.
[01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:58.240]   You'd be crazy to write this yourself to find out more and to get your first $50,000
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:04.000]   in transactions fee free braintreepayments.com/twit.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.160]   I thank them so much for their support.
[01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:06.480]   All right.
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:13.280]   I really try to stir up some anger, some angst over Google's new logo.
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:14.400]   Nothing.
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:16.640]   Nothing.
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:18.320]   How about the Nexus event?
[01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:20.640]   Rumor is September 29th.
[01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:22.480]   We've been waiting for a Nexus 5.
[01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:23.440]   It's really interesting.
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:25.600]   I mean, EAF has been going on all week long in Berlin.
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:30.400]   Samsung had announcements.
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:33.040]   Actually, Sony's announcements were probably the most interesting.
[01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:37.200]   Apple's announcements can actually, for some reason, Google's decided to do the Nexus.
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:39.280]   I guess they don't really even care if they sell them.
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:41.600]   The Nexus event, like, yeah, we'll do it later.
[01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:44.160]   They'll do it when they're good and ready.
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:48.720]   When they're good and ready, there's a new Nexus 5 supposedly made by LG.
[01:15:48.720 --> 01:15:49.920]   That's the rumor.
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:54.000]   A larger device in Nexus 6 replacement built by Huawei.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.840]   No idea what they'll charge.
[01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:03.520]   I think one of the things that held this up is that they wanted to put the new version of
[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:05.040]   Android on their Marshmallow.
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:08.880]   Google spokesperson said, "I have no comment."
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:11.440]   It might be the first time.
[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:15.200]   I think it'd be the first time you get a Huawei phone officially in the US, right?
[01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:19.600]   You'd have to go to Alibaba or somewhere to buy a Huawei phone in the US
[01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:22.000]   before. I'm so excited.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.680]   I've been waiting for that for so long.
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:24.480]   That's what I wanted.
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:25.200]   Really, a Huawei?
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:26.320]   No.
[01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:27.120]   No, not at all.
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:29.120]   How about the Moto X Puretage?
[01:16:29.120 --> 01:16:30.640]   I ordered mine on Wednesday.
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:31.760]   Are you going to get one of them?
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:33.360]   No.
[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:33.760]   You don't care.
[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:34.080]   None of it.
[01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:34.480]   Nobody cares.
[01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:35.680]   You're all iPhone users.
[01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:36.240]   You don't care.
[01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:37.440]   It's true.
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:38.800]   I mean, this is why some of the media, man.
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:39.520]   But I got wood.
[01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:40.640]   This thing has wood.
[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:42.560]   It has leather or wood on the back.
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:43.920]   It's now how much would you do?
[01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:44.640]   Then we have a title.
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:47.280]   I would pay negative money for it.
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:48.400]   They don't have to pay me to pay it.
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:49.600]   I don't want leather on my phone.
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:51.280]   You don't want a leather phone?
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:53.760]   Or leather wallet?
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:53.760]   Really?
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:54.720]   I don't want leather at all.
[01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:57.120]   I can just pass an entire concept.
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:16:59.280]   Actually, when we know Jenny doesn't, she's a vegan.
[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:02.240]   I was a vegan.
[01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:05.600]   And then I was diagnosed with cancer.
[01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:08.480]   And then I thought, well, that didn't work out.
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:09.520]   Maybe I'll eat some more meat.
[01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:10.480]   All right.
[01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:13.680]   No, the truth is I still eat a very plant-centric diet,
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:15.360]   but I wouldn't call myself a vegan.
[01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:15.920]   All right.
[01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:17.760]   But you wouldn't mind a wouldn't phone.
[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:19.520]   Ah, come on.
[01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:22.240]   I can't even get you interested.
[01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:24.080]   Well, come out here in Homestead,
[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:25.040]   we'll see you in front of me.
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:25.520]   Come on, we'll see you in front of me.
[01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:25.520]   [laughter]
[01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:27.680]   Real.
[01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:28.800]   Oh, all right.
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:31.920]   How about these new Xperia phones?
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:34.960]   Actually, there was a funny article in Mashable.
[01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:42.800]   Sony, for reasons no one understands, announced a 4K display on the Z5 premium.
[01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:44.320]   It's like 800 and something.
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:45.520]   800 dots, Prince.
[01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:45.920]   Yeah.
[01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:47.120]   Pick this bridge.
[01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:48.320]   That makes 806.
[01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:49.840]   No sense.
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:50.640]   Makes no sense.
[01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:51.600]   And here's the problem with it.
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:53.120]   The reason it makes no sense is,
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:55.520]   number one, is when we think of a fine magazine,
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:59.840]   as sharp as we can think of it as 300 or 400, 300 DPI.
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:01.520]   I remember when the Apple LaserRider came out,
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:04.000]   300 DPI, I was like, oh, you can never see any dots.
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:07.440]   And the issue is, it may be a little bit more than that or whatever,
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:10.320]   but when you have these crazy resolutions for the phone,
[01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:11.920]   that affects your battery life, it affects your battery life.
[01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:14.160]   It affects your battery life.
[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:15.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:16.720]   Go ahead.
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:19.200]   It affects battery life.
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:24.000]   It affects how much you can do with the graphics processor.
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.600]   It affects the way the game's played,
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:29.040]   because now every developer now has to develop for this to get it that sharp.
[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:32.800]   They may be pixel doubling or quadropling or something like that,
[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:33.360]   but it's still--
[01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:37.440]   So we don't know because it's not out of the way out until later in the year.
[01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:40.560]   But I did read one report that said that, in fact,
[01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:43.840]   most of the time it's 1080p, it does do pixel doubling
[01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:45.680]   as Apple does with its high DPI displays.
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:50.000]   You only see the 4K, the 800, whatever it is,
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:53.760]   dot sprints when you're looking at video or movies.
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:56.880]   They're also putting Sony's upscaler.
[01:18:56.880 --> 01:18:58.320]   They have a very good upscaler on the TV.
[01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:00.720]   Supposedly, that technology will also be in the phone.
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:05.280]   So you'll be able to look at HD or even SD content and see it'll look good.
[01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:06.400]   Who cares?
[01:19:06.400 --> 01:19:08.800]   No, if I could be able to see the difference between 4K and--
[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:11.200]   And I can see the difference between 4K on a regular screen,
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:13.040]   between 4K and 1080p.
[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:14.480]   I don't know if I could do it on a--
[01:19:14.480 --> 01:19:14.960]   Oh.
[01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:17.520]   The funniest thing, a piece by Raymond Wong and Mashable.
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:20.960]   He talked about the journalists who during the Sony event,
[01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:23.040]   they're, you know, they're champing at the bit to get over there.
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:24.400]   Look at that 4K phone.
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:28.720]   Before the event even ends, they're starting to rush the demo tables.
[01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:30.480]   They're exclaiming.
[01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:31.440]   They're looking at the demos.
[01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:35.040]   Wow, isn't that a great screen the Sony reps are standing there nodding?
[01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:40.320]   He had a waiting line to get over there.
[01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:43.360]   I was quick in Nimble.
[01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:47.760]   I didn't even sit down, but I bolted, but I wasn't quick enough.
[01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:50.160]   Dozens of other reporters got there first, so I had to wait,
[01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:57.920]   watch them go crazy over this 4K display, except it wasn't the 4K display.
[01:19:57.920 --> 01:19:59.600]   It was a 1080p display.
[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:03.680]   They had the premium and another room locked down.
[01:20:03.680 --> 01:20:06.800]   The Sony reps didn't bother to correct anybody.
[01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:10.800]   It just shows you-- I mean, these guys are looking at a 1080p display saying,
[01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:13.680]   "Wow, that 4K really looks good."
[01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:15.600]   "Intanity P on a little phone looks amazing."
[01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:16.400]   It looks good.
[01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:17.120]   It does.
[01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:17.840]   It looks great.
[01:20:17.840 --> 01:20:21.600]   It kind of underscores you probably can't tell the difference.
[01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:27.120]   Sony had Booth attendance guarding the premium devices, and no touching allowed,
[01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:29.680]   so you couldn't really play with his Z5.
[01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:30.720]   They just barely worked.
[01:20:30.720 --> 01:20:31.120]   Premium.
[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:32.800]   Usually what happens when they say no touching a lot,
[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:34.720]   it's like, this is too early.
[01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:35.760]   You can look it on the graphics process.
[01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:37.040]   He went and asked the Sony rep.
[01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:39.840]   He said, "I thought the Z5 premium was on the table.
[01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:42.400]   The rep said, 'Oh, yeah, there's a Z5 on the table.'"
[01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:45.040]   And then talked to somebody else and said, "No, I'm sorry.
[01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:46.480]   No, there's no premiums on the table.
[01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:47.440]   They're only in that room."
[01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:49.040]   So everybody was fooled.
[01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:51.840]   I'm not going to mock the journalists.
[01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:55.920]   It just shows you-- you can't tell the difference between 1080p and 4K.
[01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:57.280]   Nevertheless, I'll buy one.
[01:20:57.280 --> 01:20:59.600]   Because it's what you do.
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:00.160]   Built that way.
[01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:03.520]   And it comes in gold.
[01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:05.840]   Not real gold, just gold in.
[01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:07.440]   Rose gold?
[01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:08.000]   Rose gold.
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.360]   No, no, that's the iPhone.
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:11.280]   Are you going to get the rose gold?
[01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:12.080]   Of course you are, Jenny.
[01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:14.640]   I would get gold gold.
[01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:15.120]   Gold gold.
[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:21.520]   It's hard to really gin up any excitement about this stuff at all.
[01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:22.720]   I'm trying.
[01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:23.840]   So hard.
[01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:24.880]   We're just stuck in this--
[01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:28.880]   We're stuck in the Android smartphone spec war still.
[01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:30.560]   And so just before it plays cool.
[01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:32.160]   But it's not out yet.
[01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:33.040]   It may not work that well.
[01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:34.240]   There's not a lot of content for it.
[01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:35.120]   Games aren't ready for it.
[01:21:35.120 --> 01:21:36.320]   So it's like a data point.
[01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:39.040]   But I'm not going to brush online now and reserve it.
[01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:39.520]   Right.
[01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:40.240]   Just a data point.
[01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:40.560]   It's cool.
[01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:42.080]   But yeah, it's just enough.
[01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:43.440]   Samsung's Gear S2.
[01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:46.160]   Samsung's sticking with Tizen, which is interesting.
[01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:47.760]   I think they've done Android Wear watches,
[01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:50.560]   but their newest watches, including the Gear S2,
[01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:52.160]   which looks pretty good.
[01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:56.720]   We had a review yesterday on the show from Slash Gear.
[01:21:56.720 --> 01:22:00.800]   Uses a bezel instead of a knob.
[01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:02.080]   I like the bezel better than the knob.
[01:22:02.080 --> 01:22:03.280]   Kind of does the same thing.
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:04.560]   It does the same thing, but I like the fact
[01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:05.680]   that it's easier to get to.
[01:22:05.680 --> 01:22:08.800]   It looks nice.
[01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:09.440]   It's round.
[01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:10.560]   I like round watches.
[01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:12.560]   I don't know.
[01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:14.800]   Any of you wear an Apple watch?
[01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:16.240]   I have an Apple watch.
[01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:16.320]   No.
[01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:18.480]   Do you like your Apple watch?
[01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:19.680]   I don't like it right now.
[01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:20.320]   Yeah.
[01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:21.200]   Oh, you are.
[01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:23.280]   What do you got in a rubber case?
[01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:24.480]   I got in a little rubber case.
[01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:24.960]   That's cool.
[01:22:24.960 --> 01:22:25.920]   I'm not.
[01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:26.480]   I'm tough on it.
[01:22:26.480 --> 01:22:27.600]   I move road cases around.
[01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:29.440]   I mean, it's not going to survive otherwise.
[01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:33.040]   But the Tizen is--
[01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:34.080]   I couldn't go back.
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:36.160]   Samsung's own operating system.
[01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:36.720]   And there's--
[01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:39.680]   So I guess it will work with Android and iPhone.
[01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:40.880]   But there's some question of whether--
[01:22:40.880 --> 01:22:42.240]   Is there really room for a third
[01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:45.120]   smart watch operating system out there?
[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:46.240]   Well, I don't think--
[01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:47.680]   At least what we've seen so far,
[01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:48.720]   I don't think that the operating system
[01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:50.240]   has to work very hard on the watch.
[01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:51.040]   I mean, it's--
[01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:51.840]   They all do rough things.
[01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:52.480]   They're the same thing.
[01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:52.800]   Yeah.
[01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:54.640]   They're just a handful of things they need them to do.
[01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:54.960]   Right.
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:55.440]   And it's--
[01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:59.920]   But I wasn't sure if I was going to stick with it
[01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:00.720]   when I got the phone--
[01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:01.440]   when I got the watch.
[01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:02.560]   But now I don't think I could give it up.
[01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:03.760]   Because I'm just sure it used to be
[01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:04.240]   number--
[01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:06.160]   Look down and decide, no, I'm not going to answer that call.
[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:06.640]   Yeah.
[01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:07.920]   That's mostly--
[01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:08.400]   That's really--
[01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:08.880]   That's not--
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:10.880]   It's just notifications then?
[01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:12.480]   Is that really your killer use case?
[01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:13.280]   It's just the fact that you can--
[01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:14.080]   Well, you can talk to this.
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:14.880]   You can talk to it.
[01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:17.200]   You can say, send Alex Wilham a text.
[01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:18.560]   Responding on text, responding.
[01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:19.920]   You know, being able to respond with--
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:23.680]   I wish I could pre-program my responses into the Apple.
[01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:25.760]   I mean, like, you know, like it comes up with a bunch of them.
[01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:27.440]   And I wish there was like four automatic ones.
[01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:28.240]   Right.
[01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:30.080]   You know, screw that.
[01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:31.920]   You know, or-- or--
[01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:32.480]   Sue them.
[01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:33.840]   Or, you know, whatever.
[01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:35.040]   Sue them.
[01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:35.920]   You say them in a lot.
[01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:36.720]   Sue them.
[01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:37.280]   Sue them.
[01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:39.360]   No, no, I-- but the--
[01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:41.120]   But I-- you know, I wish that like, yes, no,
[01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:43.120]   was always two of the options that I--
[01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:43.600]   Yeah, not.
[01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:44.480]   --I don't want to be cute.
[01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:45.680]   I just went yes or no.
[01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:46.880]   And there's the first two that should
[01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:50.240]   be the response for everything because I usually
[01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:51.920]   don't like to respond with any other words.
[01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:54.400]   There's Chris Davies' thumb twiddling that--
[01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:55.040]   I really like that.
[01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:55.520]   I really like that.
[01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:56.800]   Look, I think that's a good UI.
[01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:56.960]   Right.
[01:23:56.960 --> 01:23:58.000]   It's a better UI than--
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:00.560]   Then--
[01:24:00.560 --> 01:24:01.440]   Yeah.
[01:24:01.440 --> 01:24:04.320]   It seems more natural.
[01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:04.720]   All right.
[01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:06.400]   I don't know why I'm bringing all this stuff up.
[01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:07.600]   Nobody cares.
[01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:10.960]   You guys didn't even buy an Apple watch.
[01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:12.880]   We're too cool with Apple Watches.
[01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:13.600]   Are you?
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:16.480]   Do you wear a wristwatch of any kind?
[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:17.360]   I have a smartphone.
[01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:18.320]   Why would I need an extra guy?
[01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:19.920]   It's kind of my answer.
[01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:20.320]   I think--
[01:24:20.320 --> 01:24:22.160]   Yeah, but I think that if you buy the Apple watch,
[01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:23.040]   it means you're less cool.
[01:24:23.040 --> 01:24:24.560]   So it's the first Apple product of my view that
[01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:26.880]   actually makes you less fun and interesting if you have one.
[01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:29.600]   Because I'm just kind of just a boring Apple fan.
[01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:30.080]   Really?
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:30.880]   Sorry for the ones.
[01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:32.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:36.080]   This is why I have so many friends.
[01:24:36.080 --> 01:24:37.040]   I'll talk to you.
[01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:40.720]   Uh, all right.
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:42.720]   You'd say-- I thought this was going to be such a--
[01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:43.920]   you never know.
[01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:45.840]   I thought this was going to be such a jam packed week
[01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:47.520]   because we had all those e-fenned announcements.
[01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:51.760]   And unfortunately, we have people who are just not consumers.
[01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:53.920]   You guys are not like just rapacious consumers.
[01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:54.480]   You're thoughtful.
[01:24:54.480 --> 01:24:55.760]   Because we're all too old, Leo.
[01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:57.440]   Why didn't you book some millennials' show?
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:24:58.000]   Yeah.
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.040]   Oh, I got to have the new thing.
[01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:02.880]   I made a big mistake, a big era.
[01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:04.320]   I'm just-- I'm at a place in my life
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:08.960]   where I'm more excited about things that I grow or ferment.
[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:11.200]   I am kind of with you.
[01:25:11.200 --> 01:25:17.520]   I think we got so sucked into these shiny objects
[01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:19.600]   that we kind of left-- let life pass you by.
[01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:21.120]   And I think maybe a brush--
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:23.360]   a brush with the Grim Reaper maybe is a good way
[01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:25.680]   to focus the attention on what really matters.
[01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:27.600]   It doesn't really recommend that anybody who
[01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:29.240]   wants to figure out their priorities--
[01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:29.880]   Yeah.
[01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:31.080]   Get cancer.
[01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:32.440]   Yeah.
[01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:33.760]   It's the next thing.
[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:35.360]   I feel like I'm in the waiting room.
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:36.640]   I feel like it's just--
[01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:38.160]   I'm just waiting to get cancer.
[01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:39.240]   That's what I'm doing now.
[01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:40.640]   Oh, don't say that, Leo.
[01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:42.520]   I can joke about it, but don't joke about it.
[01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:44.360]   Well, I don't mean it as a joke.
[01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:46.840]   I feel like that's just inevitable at some point.
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:47.520]   And--
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:48.720]   No, no, no later.
[01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:49.520]   No.
[01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:52.360]   No, Leo looks 75, right, Leo?
[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:53.360]   Yeah.
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:56.440]   Yeah, my prostate is the size of a grapefruit.
[01:25:56.440 --> 01:25:57.280]   TMI.
[01:25:57.280 --> 01:25:59.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:01.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:02.480]   It was a fun thing.
[01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:05.320]   This does no longer feels like a safe space.
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:06.320]   I'm sorry.
[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:07.320]   [CHEERING]
[01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:07.920]   No, for my--
[01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:08.960]   I'm sorry.
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:10.160]   It is a safe space.
[01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:12.040]   You know, I feel like the patriarchy
[01:26:12.040 --> 01:26:13.400]   is getting a little out of control.
[01:26:13.400 --> 01:26:14.920]   Oh, god, no.
[01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:18.240]   I might have to retreat into my kitten room room.
[01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:19.840]   Not the patriarchy.
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:21.880]   Do you have a kitten room?
[01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:22.560]   Yes.
[01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:22.960]   Really?
[01:26:22.960 --> 01:26:23.680]   Yes, I do.
[01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:25.920]   I have a room full of kittens.
[01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:28.760]   In fact, it's just right behind this window.
[01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:31.920]   Are you an evil genius?
[01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:34.320]   No, I'm just the queen of the internet.
[01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:36.280]   I have a kitten room.
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:37.560]   You know, we have two kittens.
[01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:40.200]   That's practically a kitten room the way they move around.
[01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:41.680]   A kitten movie, really great.
[01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:42.200]   A kitten room.
[01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:42.920]   Really think about it.
[01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:45.040]   How many kittens would you need to fill a kitten room?
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:45.680]   You need eight to 10.
[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:46.520]   Depends on how big they are.
[01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:47.560]   Eight to 10, kittens.
[01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:48.480]   Eight to 10?
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:48.840]   Yeah, I'd say.
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:50.440]   Eight to 10, I'm thinking hundreds.
[01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:51.760]   Really, is that all eight to 10?
[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:52.600]   But then you'd have to--
[01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:54.240]   I would-- I would love to have a room that
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:27:00.160]   was filled with stuffed, fluffy, small toy kittens.
[01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:01.200]   Wouldn't that be great?
[01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:02.760]   Like, you could just like a bouncy castle,
[01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:05.080]   but it's just full of tiny furry--
[01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:08.600]   I saw your Instagram of you lying naked in your squash patch.
[01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:09.160]   I feel like--
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:09.880]   I wasn't naked.
[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:11.760]   I was wearing a desk.
[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:13.880]   That would be really creepy and bad.
[01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:15.520]   That'd be a bad, bad move.
[01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:21.040]   I'm sorry.
[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:21.800]   No.
[01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:22.880]   It's that patriarchy.
[01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:23.760]   It sneaks up on me.
[01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:24.960]   I can't help it.
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:26.320]   It was just-- it was so fun.
[01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:29.800]   I was just lying down there this morning with my head
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:32.880]   in the dirt and these vines crawling around my neck.
[01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:33.720]   And it was just--
[01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:34.720]   It's a great picture.
[01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:37.880]   You look like poison ivy in the Batman.
[01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:39.960]   It was so much more fun than trying
[01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:43.360]   to figure out which new watch to buy.
[01:27:43.360 --> 01:27:44.800]   Yes.
[01:27:44.800 --> 01:27:47.400]   I'm with you on that.
[01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:48.440]   Much more fun.
[01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:49.440]   Lie with your squash.
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:49.600]   Squash is forever.
[01:27:49.600 --> 01:27:49.920]   You know what?
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:52.400]   I don't need to recharge my squash.
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:53.240]   No.
[01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:55.240]   It does not require any of your stuff at all.
[01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:57.480]   Do you have a spiralizer?
[01:27:57.480 --> 01:27:58.400]   Oh, my God.
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:27:59.280]   Yes.
[01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:00.280]   Aren't they awesome?
[01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:01.960]   I'm the first person on the internet
[01:28:01.960 --> 01:28:03.720]   to become crazy about spiralizers.
[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:04.920]   Spiralizers?
[01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:07.160]   My daughter told me about spiralizers.
[01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:10.000]   Darth and I on Twitter have long conversations
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:11.640]   about how great spiralizers are.
[01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:15.520]   Darth, the guy who does all the cute animal stuff.
[01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:16.040]   Yeah.
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:17.040]   That's a nice pencil show for me.
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:18.680]   But Darth might be a woman for all of them.
[01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:21.920]   Now, do you have one of those big spiralizers with a crank
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:25.160]   or you just have one of the little conical spiralizers?
[01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:25.520]   Oh, man.
[01:28:25.520 --> 01:28:27.600]   If you're going to go, you've got to go all the way.
[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:29.760]   Yeah, I have a crank one.
[01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:30.440]   Oh, wow.
[01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:32.000]   I make zucchini pasta with it.
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:34.280]   Well, that's what I got it for, because I
[01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:36.760]   thought it'd be great for pasta, because I make a great spaghetti
[01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:38.800]   sauce, a great bolognese.
[01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:40.120]   But I don't want to eat the pasta.
[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:42.400]   So I thought if I could make zucchini into pasta.
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:43.680]   Oh, listen.
[01:28:43.680 --> 01:28:45.400]   Is this a food podcast?
[01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:47.720]   Because I'm going to get real with the food.
[01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:50.720]   What you need to do?
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:53.600]   Some people like to take the skin off
[01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:56.200]   so that it looks more like believable pasta,
[01:28:56.200 --> 01:28:58.680]   so that it can pass as pasta.
[01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:02.040]   You just sprinkle a little bit of salt on the zucchini strips
[01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:04.040]   and let them sweat a little bit.
[01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:06.120]   And then, I don't know, after like a half an hour or something,
[01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:07.800]   you just pat them dry.
[01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:09.440]   And that's what I have to do.
[01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:10.880]   So I do that with eggplant, too.
[01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:14.440]   You put a little salt and it draws the moisture out.
[01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:16.560]   I need to do that, because it gets kind of soggy
[01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:19.640]   if you don't do that.
[01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:21.720]   So that's go, and there goes Jenny.
[01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:26.880]   She probably was wandering down to get some zucchini to spy.
[01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:29.480]   You're going to get her a better Wi-Fi connection.
[01:29:29.480 --> 01:29:30.640]   Let's take a break.
[01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:32.000]   I don't know where I--
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:33.160]   And talk more.
[01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:34.920]   I love my spiralizer.
[01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:35.520]   I want one now.
[01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:36.480]   I don't have like this.
[01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:38.680]   I have a cheap one that's just a conical thing.
[01:29:38.680 --> 01:29:42.880]   It looks like one of those bar implements for a shot glass.
[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:45.800]   And it's got a little razor sharp edges in it.
[01:29:45.800 --> 01:29:47.800]   And you just stick the zucchini in there.
[01:29:47.800 --> 01:29:50.360]   But I think this--
[01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:52.080]   anyway.
[01:29:52.080 --> 01:29:53.080]   Our show--
[01:29:53.080 --> 01:29:54.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:56.360]   This is a weird moment on Twitter.
[01:29:56.360 --> 01:29:57.480]   This is weird all around.
[01:29:57.480 --> 01:29:59.520]   This whole show is weird.
[01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:01.560]   I'm going to give it a weird out of 10, definitely.
[01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:02.080]   OK.
[01:30:02.080 --> 01:30:02.560]   I have two different points.
[01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:05.080]   OK.
[01:30:05.080 --> 01:30:06.720]   Show today brought to you by Audible.com.
[01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:07.680]   We love audio books.
[01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:08.720]   You know that.
[01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:11.160]   Don't have to tell you twice, except I do.
[01:30:11.160 --> 01:30:13.840]   Why aren't you a member of Audible.com yet?
[01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:15.800]   That's my question for you.
[01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:20.280]   On your way to work, on your way to school, wherever you go,
[01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:21.840]   don't be a fool.
[01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:22.840]   Get Audible.
[01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:23.840]   Did you just make that up for you?
[01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:24.760]   No, I have a jingle.
[01:30:24.760 --> 01:30:25.760]   That's impressive.
[01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:30.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:30:30.280 --> 01:30:31.920]   Can you sing it next time?
[01:30:31.920 --> 01:30:33.320]   I could find it, actually.
[01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:34.920]   I could find the Audible jingle.
[01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:35.880]   I have it here somewhere.
[01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:43.320]   Audible is a bookstore of 180,000 audio books, fabulous audio
[01:30:43.320 --> 01:30:47.600]   books, fiction, nonfiction.
[01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:49.440]   I'm just a huge fan.
[01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:50.480]   Oh, I've got to read this.
[01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:51.480]   I'm meaning to read this.
[01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:53.080]   Have you read this Ed Catmull's book yet?
[01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:54.080]   No.
[01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:57.440]   Creativity and Keys, of course, the president of Pixar.
[01:30:57.440 --> 01:30:58.080]   Oh, I want to--
[01:30:58.080 --> 01:31:00.640]   Was president all through the Steve Jobs era?
[01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:01.480]   And many agree.
[01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:05.560]   I just read Becoming Steve Jobs, the latest biography of Steve.
[01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:07.760]   And in that book, they talk a lot about him and really
[01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:10.280]   agree that if it weren't for Ed Catmull,
[01:31:10.280 --> 01:31:11.680]   Pixar wouldn't be the company it is.
[01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:15.160]   Because you need a leader at the company who supports the
[01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:18.160]   creatives and creators are notoriously difficult to kind
[01:31:18.160 --> 01:31:21.320]   of herd like a room full of cats.
[01:31:21.320 --> 01:31:23.000]   It's like a kitten room.
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:24.280]   Yeah, it's like--
[01:31:24.280 --> 01:31:26.160]   And he apparently just brilliant at it.
[01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:29.160]   Anyway, he's written a book called Overcoming the Unseen
[01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:31.520]   Forces that Stand in the Way of Transpiration.
[01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:32.920]   And I hear it's wonderful.
[01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:34.880]   That's going to be next on my list.
[01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:39.640]   Right now, my next book that I have already downloaded,
[01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:43.480]   but I can go to my Audible library and show you, is something--
[01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:46.240]   I may be Jenny has heard of this.
[01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:52.240]   She Shin Liu is a Chinese science fiction author who is
[01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:54.080]   being much celebrated.
[01:31:54.080 --> 01:31:55.720]   He's written a trilogy.
[01:31:55.720 --> 01:31:59.160]   First book is called The Three Body Problem.
[01:31:59.160 --> 01:32:01.560]   And I've been dying to read this that just the English
[01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:03.760]   translation just recently came out.
[01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:05.480]   Have you read it yet, Jenny?
[01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:06.480]   Nope.
[01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:08.840]   I've heard very good things about it.
[01:32:08.840 --> 01:32:11.480]   Set against the backdrop of China's cultural revolution,
[01:32:11.480 --> 01:32:14.840]   a secret military project, sends signals into space
[01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:16.400]   to establish contact with aliens.
[01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:19.400]   And alien civilization on the brink of destruction
[01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:22.320]   captures the signal and plans to invade Earth.
[01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:25.440]   Apparently, though, because they're so distant,
[01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:28.080]   we have a lot of time to prepare.
[01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:28.640]   Like centuries.
[01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:29.640]   That's something like a really cool story.
[01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:30.320]   I would read that.
[01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:32.080]   Yeah.
[01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:33.320]   This is the first volume.
[01:32:33.320 --> 01:32:35.600]   The second volume has also been recorded.
[01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:39.080]   I think Audible is currently working on the third volume,
[01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:39.640]   Dead End.
[01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:41.920]   Dark Forest is the second.
[01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:42.800]   I've got the first two.
[01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:44.160]   I will give you a report.
[01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:46.200]   As soon as I finish those.
[01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:47.480]   But those are--
[01:32:47.480 --> 01:32:48.680]   I can't wait to read those.
[01:32:48.680 --> 01:32:50.760]   I've been reading a lot lately on Audible because I've
[01:32:50.760 --> 01:32:52.040]   been doing traveling.
[01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:53.760]   When I'm in the plane, I need an audiobook.
[01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:55.360]   I put my headphones in and I relax
[01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:57.600]   and I listen to an audiobook.
[01:32:57.600 --> 01:32:59.560]   I just listen to one of the great courses.
[01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:01.200]   These are great too, and Audible.
[01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:06.960]   College lectures on pretty much every subject under the sun.
[01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:10.760]   And you can just get these lectures, listen to them.
[01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:15.320]   Here's one I bet you would like from Professor Mark Moessie,
[01:33:15.320 --> 01:33:19.960]   practicing mindfulness and introduction to meditation.
[01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:23.120]   This is on my list, my to-do list of things.
[01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:23.920]   To meditate?
[01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:24.760]   Yeah.
[01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:26.080]   You should meditate on that.
[01:33:26.080 --> 01:33:27.240]   I should think about it.
[01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:28.320]   I should meditate on it.
[01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:29.840]   Perhaps I will act upon it.
[01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:32.000]   Tell you what I'm going to do right now and give you two books
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:33.040]   for free.
[01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:34.160]   Maybe this will be one of them.
[01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:35.560]   All you got to do is go--
[01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:36.800]   Jenny's all excited.
[01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:39.960]   Audible.com/twit2, you'll sign up for the Platinum Plan.
[01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:41.200]   That's two books a month.
[01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:43.640]   It includes the Daily Digest or the Wall Street Journal
[01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:47.080]   or the New York Times, which is also great to listen to
[01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:49.960]   as you want to catch up on your news in the car.
[01:33:49.960 --> 01:33:53.040]   And you can cancel any time in the first 30 days.
[01:33:53.040 --> 01:33:55.240]   Pay nothing, but keep those two books.
[01:33:55.240 --> 01:33:57.480]   They're yours as a little thank you.
[01:33:57.480 --> 01:33:59.800]   But I think really the point is to get you listening.
[01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:01.600]   Because I think once you start listening to Audible,
[01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:03.000]   it's pretty hard to stop.
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:06.840]   Can I put in an unscripted unpaid plug for Audible?
[01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:08.840]   Yes, you can.
[01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:10.640]   I moved here to myself with because I was going
[01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:12.320]   to be cute with my dog.
[01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:13.320]   But then he ran off.
[01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:15.240]   Oh, man, chappy.
[01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:16.320]   Maybe chappy will come back.
[01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:20.080]   I'll put a stake in my hand or something.
[01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:23.520]   So I really like Audible.
[01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:27.480]   And I have listened to a number of books on Audible
[01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:31.040]   because when you have cancer and when you're going through
[01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:35.480]   treatment, this is how I first got turned on to Audible.
[01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:36.960]   It's really hard to concentrate.
[01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:37.480]   Yeah.
[01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:39.360]   It's really hard to concentrate long enough
[01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:42.480]   to finish a chapter, a little whole book.
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:44.960]   But having somebody read to you is really calming.
[01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:47.720]   And there's just a whole different part of your brain
[01:34:47.720 --> 01:34:51.320]   that gets used when you're listening to somebody read to you.
[01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:54.680]   So I actually did listen to a lot of guided meditations.
[01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:55.640]   Smart.
[01:34:55.640 --> 01:34:58.080]   Jack Cornfield is this mindfulness.
[01:34:58.080 --> 01:35:00.120]   I know, Jack, because I go to Spirit Rock.
[01:35:00.120 --> 01:35:01.120]   He's up here.
[01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:02.240]   Well, you go to Spirit Rock?
[01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:03.120]   Oh, he's wonderful.
[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:03.880]   Yeah.
[01:35:03.880 --> 01:35:07.600]   My cancer therapist was the first to turn me on to Spirit Rock
[01:35:07.600 --> 01:35:09.040]   and how wonderful their programs are.
[01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:10.240]   I've never been there.
[01:35:10.240 --> 01:35:13.480]   But it's like just a really good brain exercise.
[01:35:13.480 --> 01:35:15.040]   Nearby, it's over here in Icasio.
[01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:16.640]   I used to live in Icasio.
[01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:17.640]   Yeah, just right around the corner.
[01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:20.160]   And Jack, of course, I don't know if he was the founder,
[01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:21.720]   but he's there all the time, lectures there.
[01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:22.760]   And he's wonderful.
[01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:23.560]   Super cool guy.
[01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:24.600]   He's just a beautiful guy, yeah.
[01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:28.360]   No, there's a lot of BS self-help stuff out there.
[01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:30.960]   And he teaches old school meditation.
[01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:31.440]   I like it.
[01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:34.160]   But I download his stuff I've audible all the time.
[01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:35.480]   Yeah, I've meditated to Jack.
[01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:37.640]   He's great.
[01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:38.000]   Really fun.
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:42.640]   I can actually imitate the Audible audiobook intro.
[01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:44.880]   Yes, the audiobook is brought to you.
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:46.800]   But Audible brought home.
[01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:49.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:53.840]   I don't know who that guy is, but I have to laugh each time.
[01:35:53.840 --> 01:35:57.480]   At the end, he goes, thank you for listening to Audible.
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:35:58.960]   I just laugh every time.
[01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:01.160]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:05.240]   By the way, the only dog in your house
[01:36:05.240 --> 01:36:07.560]   blessed by the Dalai Lama.
[01:36:07.560 --> 01:36:08.640]   Yes, it's true.
[01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:11.280]   My boyfriend and my dog and I went
[01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:13.480]   to see his Holiness the Dalai Lama.
[01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:15.960]   And we were in a basement underneath the hotel
[01:36:15.960 --> 01:36:17.280]   with all these secret service guys.
[01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:19.120]   And his Holiness was coming in.
[01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:20.480]   And they opened the doors.
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:22.680]   And there was all these really serious dudes and dogs
[01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:24.040]   and weapons and stuff.
[01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:25.680]   And he looked at Chappy.
[01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:27.080]   I was holding Chappy.
[01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:28.880]   And he looked at Chappy's chewing my hair.
[01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:32.160]   And then he went right for Chappy.
[01:36:32.160 --> 01:36:37.240]   And like, he's wandering a chin like this.
[01:36:37.240 --> 01:36:38.840]   And like that.
[01:36:38.840 --> 01:36:40.680]   And Chappy has licked him.
[01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:43.320]   And then he came up to me and he went like that.
[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:45.080]   Oh.
[01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:46.920]   That's pretty easy because I don't even know.
[01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:48.280]   It's like, hey, everybody's just--
[01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:48.760]   That's sweet.
[01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:52.240]   That's-- I mean, after that Vladimir Putin.
[01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:53.240]   And then that's it, right?
[01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:54.280]   Everybody.
[01:36:54.280 --> 01:36:55.400]   You'll have--
[01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:57.440]   No, I think I could probably get along pretty well
[01:36:57.440 --> 01:37:00.000]   with Vladimir Putin if I was hanging out with Chappy.
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:02.240]   Was that on the show or was that before the show?
[01:37:02.240 --> 01:37:04.640]   Because otherwise, people are very confused.
[01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:05.520]   I was before the show.
[01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:07.600]   There's a whole tumbler.
[01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:10.960]   And I got this from Boing Boinger initially.
[01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:17.720]   Dedicated to pictures of Putin posing with animals.
[01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:20.800]   Just like I am right now.
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:24.960]   And I just feel like you and Putin have something in common.
[01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:25.480]   I love them all.
[01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:25.760]   I love them all.
[01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:26.760]   I'm trying to--
[01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:27.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:28.400]   Yes.
[01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:30.680]   Just the ones I had.
[01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:32.920]   Vladimir Putin with animals.
[01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:37.360]   I mentioned that there he is with a dwarf horse.
[01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:39.680]   Here he is topless with a dog.
[01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:40.200]   Here he is--
[01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:42.360]   I think this would be called small horses, Leo.
[01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:44.720]   I'm sorry, little horses.
[01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:48.120]   I am, again, the patriarchy reasserts itself.
[01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:49.800]   I'm feeling very unsafe on him.
[01:37:49.800 --> 01:37:50.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:37:50.800 --> 01:37:51.800]   I'm sorry.
[01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:54.720]   You had a thing about the raisins this week, by the way.
[01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:57.240]   The California raisins?
[01:37:57.240 --> 01:37:58.520]   No.
[01:37:58.520 --> 01:38:01.600]   Little people of America, midget raisins.
[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:03.200]   I'm just trying to get--
[01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:04.360]   I'm really messing with the raisins.
[01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:05.960]   We call them little raisins.
[01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:07.040]   Come on, Jenny.
[01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:08.720]   Even I know that.
[01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:09.240]   Yeah.
[01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:10.600]   They used to be called midget raisins,
[01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:15.600]   but the little people of America had a petition to change it.
[01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:15.600]   Good.
[01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:17.240]   And the USDI changed it.
[01:38:17.240 --> 01:38:18.520]   I think it's really cool.
[01:38:18.520 --> 01:38:20.000]   I think that's sensitive.
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:21.840]   The reason I brought up the Dalai Lama
[01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:24.360]   is because he has, of course, many books
[01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:26.640]   and has many books on Audible.com.
[01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:27.520]   Oh, and they're great.
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:29.240]   And he's really fun to listen to.
[01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:30.720]   Yeah, it gets--
[01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:32.000]   here's his introduction to Buddhism
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:32.800]   so you can hear his voice.
[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:35.600]   Because Martin Sheen narrates beyond religion.
[01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:36.840]   I don't know if Martin Sheen really
[01:38:36.840 --> 01:38:39.240]   has the Dalai Lama voice.
[01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:42.080]   I think while the guy's alive, you listen to his voice.
[01:38:42.080 --> 01:38:43.520]   So by the way, I think it's combined.
[01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:45.880]   So these are lectures from--
[01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:46.920]   As a foundation?
[01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:47.760]   As a foundation.
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:48.760]   Then it's a foundation.
[01:38:48.760 --> 01:38:50.920]   Shappy, it's your buddy.
[01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:52.520]   He checked out in a chin.
[01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:53.440]   Look at that.
[01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:55.360]   That's a huge shot.
[01:38:55.360 --> 01:38:57.080]   Everybody should go to Audible.com.
[01:38:57.080 --> 01:38:59.360]   There are two books there with your name on them.
[01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:01.960]   And there's so many choices, 180,000.
[01:39:01.960 --> 01:39:04.160]   And you could see just a little sampling-- science fiction,
[01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:07.080]   fiction, nonfiction, lectures.
[01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:09.600]   The latest in the Millennium series,
[01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:12.160]   The Girl in the Spider web.
[01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:13.360]   There's so much great stuff.
[01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:19.600]   Audible.com/twit2 to get your first two books free.
[01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:23.080]   And the other part of their thing is Audible.com.
[01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:25.720]   Wherever you are.
[01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:27.200]   Wherever you are.
[01:39:27.200 --> 01:39:30.880]   Are they lying on their back like you are right?
[01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:32.360]   You're the mill driver.
[01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:35.720]   That's all lying on our backs and do the show now.
[01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:36.720]   That's relax.
[01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:37.440]   Food.
[01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:38.160]   We will cheer up.
[01:39:38.160 --> 01:39:39.320]   We get high right now.
[01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:40.160]   You know--
[01:39:40.160 --> 01:39:45.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:39:45.240 --> 01:39:46.240]   I'm not actually--
[01:39:46.240 --> 01:39:47.240]   No, I know you're not.
[01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:48.040]   That's the funny thing.
[01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:52.400]   Dan Lyons.
[01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:53.600]   Any of you know Dan Lyons?
[01:39:53.600 --> 01:39:54.800]   I know Dan Lyons.
[01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:55.640]   I'm right.
[01:39:55.640 --> 01:39:56.560]   Love Dan Lyons.
[01:39:56.560 --> 01:39:59.000]   He was the fake Steve Jobs.
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.520]   Wrote was a writer for--
[01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:02.480]   was it Newsweek?
[01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:06.280]   I'm trying to remember maybe it was Time magazine.
[01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:08.000]   He--
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:09.640]   I saw him a few years ago.
[01:40:09.640 --> 01:40:11.600]   And I said, where are you working these days, Dan?
[01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:13.720]   He was working at HubSpot.
[01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:15.200]   And I said, Dan, you're a journalist.
[01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:16.880]   What are you doing at HubSpot?
[01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:17.720]   Getting paid.
[01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:21.360]   Getting paid was basically the right answer.
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:25.440]   HubSpot, which is an internet marketing and sales
[01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:27.440]   software company.
[01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:30.160]   I guess he was the journalist in residence there.
[01:40:30.160 --> 01:40:34.240]   In any event, he left HubSpot.
[01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:36.320]   Was for two weeks the editor in chief of Gawker
[01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:38.280]   until he realized what Gawker really was.
[01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:42.800]   Left there has been a staff writer for Silicon Valley.
[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:47.360]   And I credit Dan Lyons with a lot of the most accurate stuff
[01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:49.440]   in Silicon Valley, because it's sometimes so
[01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:52.080]   insider and it's just hysterical.
[01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:54.560]   Well, apparently all this time, Lyons
[01:40:54.560 --> 01:41:00.760]   has been writing a book, a memoir about his life
[01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:02.480]   at HubSpot.
[01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:06.360]   The blur before the memoir says, the office vibe
[01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:09.040]   was "Frat House Meets Cult Compound.
[01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:11.880]   Shower Pods Became Hook Up Dens.
[01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:14.440]   Nerf gunfights broke out at lunch.
[01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:19.520]   An absent bosses specialized in cryptic jargon-filled emails
[01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:21.760]   in the middle of this set Lyons old enough
[01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:25.200]   to be his co-workers' father."
[01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:30.040]   So you can imagine with Dan Lyons' wit acidic wit.
[01:41:30.040 --> 01:41:31.040]   No, man.
[01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:33.560]   This is going to be quite an exposé of HubSpot.
[01:41:33.560 --> 01:41:35.040]   So much so.
[01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:35.960]   You're a little nervous.
[01:41:35.960 --> 01:41:40.160]   That the HubSpot executives apparently hacked Dan
[01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:42.240]   and are now in trouble.
[01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:43.760]   Federal law enforcement officials
[01:41:43.760 --> 01:41:46.440]   have opened a criminal investigation
[01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:49.520]   into attempts by former HubSpot executives
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:53.760]   to obtain a pre-publication draft of the book.
[01:41:53.760 --> 01:41:55.400]   And I'm reading between the lines,
[01:41:55.400 --> 01:41:59.680]   but the FBI cyber crimes task force
[01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:02.160]   is working on this.
[01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:04.320]   The probe is at the preliminary stage.
[01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:05.560]   So we should say it's not clear
[01:42:05.560 --> 01:42:08.080]   whether there'll be criminal charges.
[01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:11.320]   But the impression I got from the article about this
[01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:14.400]   in the Boston Globe is that they attempted
[01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:20.200]   the hack Dan Lyons computer to get the manuscript
[01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:24.120]   so they could find out what he was going to say about them
[01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:27.360]   before the book was published.
[01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:29.680]   The manuscript, according to the Globe,
[01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:31.840]   the manuscript incident involved some fishiness
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:35.640]   and really aggressive tactics.
[01:42:35.640 --> 01:42:40.280]   But they haven't told us more than that.
[01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:41.120]   Lyons is--
[01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:44.480]   All I want to know is how much did Dan Lyons pay these clowns
[01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:45.520]   to do all this stuff?
[01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:47.480]   You couldn't have better publicity, right?
[01:42:47.480 --> 01:42:48.960]   I hadn't heard about the book.
[01:42:48.960 --> 01:42:49.720]   Now you have.
[01:42:49.720 --> 01:42:51.080]   Now I'm waiting for the compound on a ball.
[01:42:51.080 --> 01:42:53.960]   We're going to get Dan on as soon as we can.
[01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:54.880]   I really like Dan.
[01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:57.360]   He's got the strongest Boston accent.
[01:42:57.360 --> 01:42:59.560]   Really, there's no excuse at this point
[01:42:59.560 --> 01:43:01.840]   for having an accent that strong.
[01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:04.480]   He's just doing it to be ornery, I'm sure.
[01:43:04.480 --> 01:43:06.080]   He is characterized as the victim
[01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:07.720]   in this federal investigation.
[01:43:07.720 --> 01:43:11.760]   He did not respond to the article in the Globe.
[01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:14.360]   Apparently, the executives who were involved
[01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:17.840]   or being investigated are no longer at HubSpot.
[01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:21.000]   HubSpot said it's working on a new training and certification
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.560]   program to reinforce its ethics code.
[01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:24.720]   [LAUGHING]
[01:43:24.720 --> 01:43:26.080]   Good luck with that, bro.
[01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:29.080]   We'll have one, right?
[01:43:29.080 --> 01:43:31.080]   Before everyone screws up, not afterwards.
[01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:33.680]   So I want to tell all our employees at Twitch, please,
[01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:36.200]   don't hack anybody.
[01:43:36.200 --> 01:43:37.880]   I don't care if they're writing an expose.
[01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:38.840]   It's OK.
[01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:42.280]   And good for Dan, what great publicity for the book.
[01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:44.200]   I think it's due out soon, of course.
[01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:44.840]   Why not?
[01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:46.240]   Of course, I'll make it into a movie.
[01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:47.520]   It's got to be a movie.
[01:43:47.520 --> 01:43:49.240]   And they have now made it into--
[01:43:49.240 --> 01:43:51.080]   now it's going to-- but you kind of figure in the writer's
[01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:52.520]   room, they're looking kind of funny at him
[01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:53.400]   at Silicon Valley.
[01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:56.440]   Like, are you writing a book about us?
[01:43:56.440 --> 01:43:58.920]   Is there anything we should be worried about?
[01:43:58.920 --> 01:44:01.360]   I just want to say that that synopsis that you just
[01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:02.120]   read for the book--
[01:44:02.120 --> 01:44:02.600]   Yeah.
[01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:05.160]   --it was like basically every startup I ever looked at.
[01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:07.480]   Yeah, they're all like that.
[01:44:07.480 --> 01:44:09.640]   Hook-ups in the shower pod.
[01:44:09.640 --> 01:44:11.920]   I just want to-- Dan, if you're watching this,
[01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:14.640]   I just want to grab me by the collars and joke you on a chin,
[01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:16.520]   just like a Dalai Lama did.
[01:44:16.520 --> 01:44:20.960]   Say, Dorothy, I'm sorry, but that's how the startups work.
[01:44:20.960 --> 01:44:23.640]   But it makes a great novel.
[01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:24.200]   Or a memoir.
[01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:25.400]   Well, I haven't read it yet.
[01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:26.160]   Yeah.
[01:44:26.160 --> 01:44:28.040]   Yeah, it might make a great novel.
[01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:28.640]   I think it will.
[01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:29.400]   Dan's a great writer.
[01:44:29.400 --> 01:44:30.320]   Dan is so fun.
[01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:34.440]   He has such an acerbic wit and a dry wit and very funny guy.
[01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:36.640]   And if you read the fake Steve Jobs--
[01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:37.720]   Which is his best work.
[01:44:37.720 --> 01:44:38.800]   Oh, great stuff.
[01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:42.120]   And for-- I think years, nobody knew it was him, right?
[01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:42.640]   Right.
[01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:44.760]   Yeah.
[01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:50.280]   A man arrested for parroting the mayor--
[01:44:50.280 --> 01:44:59.480]   A mayor of Peoria, Illinois, sued and won $125,000.
[01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:03.640]   He was arrested when his residence was rated for parroting
[01:45:03.640 --> 01:45:07.880]   the town's mayor on Twitter.
[01:45:07.880 --> 01:45:13.520]   John Daniel, the operator of @PeoriaMayer on Twitter,
[01:45:13.520 --> 01:45:17.320]   was accused of impersonating a public official.
[01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:19.680]   He was never charged.
[01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:23.680]   His arrest was prompted by the local mayor, Jim Martis,
[01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:26.440]   is concerned that the tweets in the account falsely
[01:45:26.440 --> 01:45:30.000]   portrayed him as a drug abuser who associates with prostitutes.
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:33.160]   Tweets like, who stole my crack pipe?
[01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:34.200]   Really bugged him.
[01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:40.680]   So he went after the guy.
[01:45:40.680 --> 01:45:41.440]   He said, I'll get you.
[01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:47.760]   Unfortunately, the Illinois law that criminalizes
[01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:49.440]   impersonation of a public official,
[01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:52.240]   it's really more for like walking into a Burger King
[01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:54.120]   saying, I'm the mayor, give me hamburgers.
[01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:56.920]   It does not include parody and satire, which are, of course,
[01:45:56.920 --> 01:46:01.000]   protected forms of free speech.
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:06.160]   So the attorney for the fake Twitter account
[01:46:06.160 --> 01:46:10.360]   took them to court, sued, and they won $125,000 settlement.
[01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:15.040]   OK.
[01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:16.360]   They're a boomerang on that one.
[01:46:16.360 --> 01:46:18.360]   Whoops.
[01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:20.120]   Should have left them alone.
[01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:22.520]   Who actually think those tweets were not parody, right?
[01:46:22.520 --> 01:46:22.880]   But now--
[01:46:22.880 --> 01:46:23.800]   Well, that's the question.
[01:46:23.800 --> 01:46:24.480]   Right.
[01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:25.760]   Right.
[01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:27.800]   That's the question.
[01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:29.200]   It's the Streisand effect.
[01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:30.040]   Isn't that what they call it?
[01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:30.760]   Exactly.
[01:46:30.760 --> 01:46:31.960]   Yeah.
[01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:33.760]   People just do not learn that lesson.
[01:46:33.760 --> 01:46:35.920]   And I'm kind of glad they don't because we get stories
[01:46:35.920 --> 01:46:36.920]   like this out of it.
[01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:40.160]   And there's the whole world, a more funny place to be in.
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:40.680]   It's a better--
[01:46:40.680 --> 01:46:41.800]   I think it's a restaurant for a Twitter account.
[01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:42.280]   That's amazing.
[01:46:42.280 --> 01:46:44.680]   It's a better place.
[01:46:44.680 --> 01:46:48.920]   Sad Story, Pwn to Own, which is a great event held every year
[01:46:48.920 --> 01:46:54.480]   in Vancouver at Pac-Sec West, the security conference,
[01:46:54.480 --> 01:46:57.800]   lost its sponsor, HP--
[01:46:57.800 --> 01:46:59.280]   Only in Japan.
[01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:00.760]   They just can't sponsor it in Japan.
[01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:02.240]   Oh, it's in Japan only.
[01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:02.800]   I think so.
[01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:06.280]   Well, HP had just sponsored one, I think, in Vancouver.
[01:47:06.280 --> 01:47:08.080]   That's the normal in Pac-Sec West.
[01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:10.880]   But then, oh, I guess there's one in Japan coming up.
[01:47:10.880 --> 01:47:12.480]   It has to do with whatever the wasner.
[01:47:12.480 --> 01:47:14.880]   The wasner arrangement.
[01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:16.680]   Which sounds like it's not a treaty.
[01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:20.080]   It's like it's kind of like what we've all agreed to.
[01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:24.760]   The wasner agreement, which apparently something
[01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:30.880]   about you can't hold on to security exploits.
[01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:32.800]   I always thought that Pwn on was a little sketch
[01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:34.680]   in that respect, because security researchers
[01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:37.400]   would find flaws and then keep them secret
[01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:40.680]   so that they could win a free laptop or some money
[01:47:40.680 --> 01:47:44.360]   by hacking at the event.
[01:47:44.360 --> 01:47:48.360]   But HP pulled out this year--
[01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:50.160]   I put a copy of Dan Line's book in there.
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:52.680]   Yeah.
[01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:55.240]   So this only applies to--
[01:47:55.240 --> 01:47:58.320]   this is only Japan, the only signatory to the wasanire
[01:47:58.320 --> 01:47:59.080]   arrangement.
[01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:00.920]   I think what happened was, is that there's
[01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:03.320]   a couple interpretations of this--
[01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:04.280]   Size arrangement.
[01:48:04.280 --> 01:48:04.920]   Because in Canada--
[01:48:04.920 --> 01:48:05.480]   --that are nebulous.
[01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:06.960]   And in Canada, they are clear--
[01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:07.600]   It's not an issue.
[01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:08.280]   It's not an issue.
[01:48:08.280 --> 01:48:09.080]   And it's not clear.
[01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:10.560]   And HP didn't want to get--
[01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:14.160]   end up being in trouble.
[01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:16.440]   HP's already in enough trouble on its own rights.
[01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:17.800]   I feel it's an not-trading gender
[01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:21.040]   extra problems with large corporate buyers like Japan.
[01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:21.520]   Yeah.
[01:48:21.520 --> 01:48:22.440]   I like this article.
[01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:24.800]   And I hope that you read this before you design your website,
[01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:25.320]   Jenny.
[01:48:25.320 --> 01:48:29.080]   I mean, the potential redesign of the website.
[01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:30.200]   I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:31.240]   We don't know what we're talking about.
[01:48:31.240 --> 01:48:34.040]   I like Pi.
[01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:36.720]   Raspberry Pi, my favorite--
[01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:40.680]   it's my favorite line so far in Mr. Robot.
[01:48:40.680 --> 01:48:42.880]   We all know what a Raspberry Pi is.
[01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:50.280]   I like this article from Benedict Evans and his blog.
[01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:52.280]   Forget about the mobile internet.
[01:48:52.280 --> 01:48:54.200]   It's the internet.
[01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:57.960]   As more and more people visit websites on mobile devices,
[01:48:57.960 --> 01:49:00.800]   it's silly to say there's a mobile internet and a regular
[01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:01.080]   internet.
[01:49:01.080 --> 01:49:02.360]   It's all the mobile internet.
[01:49:02.360 --> 01:49:05.160]   We saw that when we did our redesign, more than 50%
[01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:08.120]   of our users came to us via smaller screens on iPhones
[01:49:08.120 --> 01:49:08.800]   and tablets.
[01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:10.800]   I have to say, what really changed for me was actually
[01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:12.200]   the larger iPhone.
[01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:15.320]   I didn't really do as much surfing.
[01:49:15.320 --> 01:49:17.760]   And it was something about that was just enough size
[01:49:17.760 --> 01:49:19.680]   difference that suddenly I have this thing in my pocket
[01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:21.880]   that I surf the web with all the time and don't think about it.
[01:49:21.880 --> 01:49:22.800]   So very important.
[01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:25.720]   And I could tell with that format that you use Jenny
[01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:28.680]   for the long form, that's mobile responsive.
[01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:30.400]   That will look good on any size screen.
[01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:32.040]   We don't have a mobile site.
[01:49:32.040 --> 01:49:32.800]   We don't have an app.
[01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:38.200]   We have one site that responds smartly to whatever you are
[01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:38.680]   looking at.
[01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:40.080]   Yep.
[01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:44.560]   Actually, oddly enough, it's particularly true as income
[01:49:44.560 --> 01:49:48.680]   falls in poorer countries and poorer users are much more likely
[01:49:48.680 --> 01:49:51.240]   to be using the internet on mobile than they are on a
[01:49:51.240 --> 01:49:52.040]   computer.
[01:49:52.040 --> 01:49:53.680]   Well, I do a lot of work in Rwanda.
[01:49:53.680 --> 01:49:55.920]   And there's only a handful of people that have computers,
[01:49:55.920 --> 01:49:57.480]   but everybody has them as a phone.
[01:49:57.480 --> 01:49:58.440]   Yeah.
[01:49:58.440 --> 01:50:01.080]   That's been my experience in Central America as well.
[01:50:01.080 --> 01:50:03.280]   I spend a fair amount of time down there.
[01:50:03.280 --> 01:50:07.600]   And there are entire generations of young people who are very,
[01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:11.880]   very internet literate for the internet that is available on
[01:50:11.880 --> 01:50:12.880]   your phone.
[01:50:12.880 --> 01:50:16.840]   Going to actually sit down at an expensive desktop computer is
[01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:21.800]   something that they'll pay a small amount per hour to access.
[01:50:21.800 --> 01:50:25.040]   But I think those little businesses, those little kiosks,
[01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:28.680]   will become less and less necessary in the developing world.
[01:50:28.680 --> 01:50:32.280]   The more that mobile becomes the norm.
[01:50:32.280 --> 01:50:33.480]   I think it's wonderful.
[01:50:33.480 --> 01:50:37.560]   Because I think it really opens up this world, this digital world
[01:50:37.560 --> 01:50:43.080]   that we all live in to people who just are never going to have
[01:50:43.080 --> 01:50:45.600]   the capital to each have computers.
[01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:47.040]   Yep.
[01:50:47.040 --> 01:50:50.960]   According to Andreessen Horowitz, two to three times more smartphones
[01:50:50.960 --> 01:50:53.760]   will be used than PCs by 2020.
[01:50:53.760 --> 01:50:57.000]   So, in fact, if you're designing a site for thinking, well,
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:58.080]   here's the desktop version.
[01:50:58.080 --> 01:50:58.880]   Here's the mobile version.
[01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:00.720]   You really got it upside down.
[01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:01.240]   Basically--
[01:51:01.240 --> 01:51:02.680]   You got to 2020 to figure it out, though.
[01:51:02.680 --> 01:51:03.120]   Yeah.
[01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:03.760]   No.
[01:51:03.760 --> 01:51:05.080]   Now.
[01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:08.320]   You know, that was why we did a redesign, frankly,
[01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:10.560]   is that we wanted to look good on any site screen.
[01:51:10.560 --> 01:51:12.360]   We really wanted it to be mobile.
[01:51:12.360 --> 01:51:13.560]   Mobile first.
[01:51:13.560 --> 01:51:18.280]   I hope that that makes things better for people with disabilities,
[01:51:18.280 --> 01:51:18.480]   too.
[01:51:18.480 --> 01:51:23.040]   If you think about it, like if we're designing for platforms
[01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:25.640]   that we can't predict exactly what platform it will be,
[01:51:25.640 --> 01:51:27.280]   maybe the content will be more fluid.
[01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:29.760]   I'm talking in big, big, aggregate terms.
[01:51:29.760 --> 01:51:35.600]   And maybe people who have visual or auditory disabilities,
[01:51:35.600 --> 01:51:37.920]   you know, if we standardize the content
[01:51:37.920 --> 01:51:40.240]   and accept that there are lots of different containers
[01:51:40.240 --> 01:51:44.240]   that it will fit into, my hope is that this becomes more
[01:51:44.240 --> 01:51:46.200]   inclusive in lots of ways.
[01:51:46.200 --> 01:51:48.360]   Yeah, I agree with you.
[01:51:48.360 --> 01:51:50.040]   We've always thought that about what we do.
[01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:52.080]   We do it in audio and video.
[01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:52.600]   Awesome.
[01:51:52.600 --> 01:51:53.520]   You know, I mean, the idea--
[01:51:53.520 --> 01:51:55.720]   And we put it everywhere.
[01:51:55.720 --> 01:51:59.080]   The idea is to make it as accessible as possible.
[01:51:59.080 --> 01:52:00.640]   Text is even better that way, right?
[01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:04.560]   I mean, text, you can put it in all sorts of containers.
[01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:05.600]   I think that's really cool.
[01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:07.520]   And I think it matters, even if you're
[01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:11.200]   thinking about a minority, you know, not--
[01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:16.280]   the majority have full sight, have full hearing, and so on.
[01:52:16.280 --> 01:52:19.000]   But designing for the minority means
[01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:21.480]   that you're putting inclusiveness first.
[01:52:21.480 --> 01:52:24.280]   And I think that's a laudable thing.
[01:52:24.280 --> 01:52:25.440]   Well, everybody--
[01:52:25.440 --> 01:52:26.280]   What?
[01:52:26.280 --> 01:52:28.120]   I wish we could afford closed captioning.
[01:52:28.120 --> 01:52:30.000]   That's the one thing we don't do.
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.280]   That's one thing that Apple actually has taken a real--
[01:52:32.280 --> 01:52:34.920]   I mean, all of those keynotes are all closed caption.
[01:52:34.920 --> 01:52:36.720]   Yeah, I would love subtitled.
[01:52:36.720 --> 01:52:38.400]   Yeah, subtitled.
[01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:38.920]   Yeah.
[01:52:38.920 --> 01:52:42.440]   Good closed captioning still requires a human.
[01:52:42.440 --> 01:52:45.600]   But as computer dictation gets better and better and better
[01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:48.040]   and better, I think we're not far off from that.
[01:52:48.040 --> 01:52:51.200]   I got to tell you, we worked with a lot of folks
[01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:52.400]   doing subtitles.
[01:52:52.400 --> 01:52:54.520]   And it's like magic watching those guys work.
[01:52:54.520 --> 01:52:56.000]   Every once in a while, they have them on site.
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.400]   Most of the time, we just give them a video feed
[01:52:58.400 --> 01:53:01.000]   or an audio feed, and they just send us back the text that
[01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:01.880]   hooks into the box.
[01:53:01.880 --> 01:53:03.840]   So it's just one person you don't have--
[01:53:03.840 --> 01:53:04.720]   We have lots of people.
[01:53:04.720 --> 01:53:06.880]   Because sometimes we get break.
[01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:08.160]   We're hard to do that.
[01:53:08.160 --> 01:53:09.360]   Yeah, but they'll do it for--
[01:53:09.360 --> 01:53:10.520]   I mean, they can do it for hours.
[01:53:10.520 --> 01:53:10.840]   Really?
[01:53:10.840 --> 01:53:15.640]   Yeah, but a lot of times, we do ones
[01:53:15.640 --> 01:53:18.320]   that are multiple languages and stuff like that.
[01:53:18.320 --> 01:53:20.760]   And then you have an interpreter who's
[01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:24.360]   then talking to the person doing the subtitling.
[01:53:24.360 --> 01:53:25.720]   In another language?
[01:53:25.720 --> 01:53:28.520]   Yes, we'll get them in three languages.
[01:53:28.520 --> 01:53:31.480]   And then you have-- anyway, so--
[01:53:31.480 --> 01:53:33.760]   but all of it's done in the cloud.
[01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:35.120]   You don't really--
[01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:36.680]   but every once in a while, they're on set.
[01:53:36.680 --> 01:53:37.240]   And these guys--
[01:53:37.240 --> 01:53:37.600]   It's a facility.
[01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:39.000]   They're sitting there, like--
[01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:40.520]   And the keys don't make any sense.
[01:53:40.520 --> 01:53:40.960]   You look at it.
[01:53:40.960 --> 01:53:42.120]   It's the craziest little keyboard.
[01:53:42.120 --> 01:53:43.520]   Oh, they have a special keyboard.
[01:53:43.520 --> 01:53:44.680]   It's like a--
[01:53:44.680 --> 01:53:45.520]   Stenow.
[01:53:45.520 --> 01:53:47.320]   But they all of them are different.
[01:53:47.320 --> 01:53:48.600]   They're all in their own little software.
[01:53:48.600 --> 01:53:50.440]   And they made all their tweaks to do it the way
[01:53:50.440 --> 01:53:51.440]   they want to do it.
[01:53:51.440 --> 01:53:51.960]   Wow.
[01:53:51.960 --> 01:53:53.600]   No one can use each other's keyboard.
[01:53:53.600 --> 01:53:54.520]   Oh, my goodness.
[01:53:54.520 --> 01:53:56.360]   And it's like-- we had four of them in front of them.
[01:53:56.360 --> 01:53:57.360]   We were doing it.
[01:53:57.360 --> 01:53:58.960]   And you see them, and they're just sitting away.
[01:53:58.960 --> 01:54:00.160]   And it's just amazing.
[01:54:00.160 --> 01:54:01.160]   It's like magic.
[01:54:01.160 --> 01:54:02.280]   I mean, it really is.
[01:54:02.280 --> 01:54:05.520]   And it's the most beautiful picture I've ever seen.
[01:54:05.520 --> 01:54:08.800]   Jenny, do you dye your hair to match Chappies here?
[01:54:08.800 --> 01:54:11.280]   It kind of worked out that way, didn't it?
[01:54:11.280 --> 01:54:11.760]   I love it.
[01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:12.880]   It broke.
[01:54:12.880 --> 01:54:15.480]   What do you think the second most popular app is in the US?
[01:54:15.480 --> 01:54:17.640]   It's Facebook Messenger.
[01:54:17.640 --> 01:54:19.000]   What?
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.000]   Facebook just-- not so long ago.
[01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:24.160]   Maybe a year ago separated Messenger out of its Facebook
[01:54:24.160 --> 01:54:24.800]   app.
[01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:29.840]   According to ComScore, Facebook is number one and number two
[01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:31.200]   now.
[01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:33.080]   You know, I thought that the splitting Messenger out
[01:54:33.080 --> 01:54:34.120]   was crazy when they did it.
[01:54:34.120 --> 01:54:34.120]   Yeah.
[01:54:34.120 --> 01:54:35.120]   Yeah.
[01:54:35.120 --> 01:54:36.840]   I vastly prefer that way.
[01:54:36.840 --> 01:54:39.200]   Number three most popular app.
[01:54:39.200 --> 01:54:41.600]   This is among all smartphone users in the US.
[01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:46.720]   YouTube, Google Search, Google Play, Google Maps, Pandora
[01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:48.320]   Radio.
[01:54:48.320 --> 01:54:49.080]   One.
[01:54:49.080 --> 01:54:50.320]   Gmail.
[01:54:50.320 --> 01:54:51.560]   Instagram.
[01:54:51.560 --> 01:54:54.240]   Yahoo stocks.
[01:54:54.240 --> 01:54:55.120]   That's the top 10.
[01:54:55.120 --> 01:54:57.920]   Then Apple Maps, Amazon, mobile Twitter, Apple Music.
[01:54:57.920 --> 01:54:59.520]   Apple Music's in there.
[01:54:59.520 --> 01:55:01.280]   That's all the stuff I delete.
[01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:02.360]   I know.
[01:55:02.360 --> 01:55:06.440]   As soon as I get the phone, take that stuff off.
[01:55:06.440 --> 01:55:08.320]   Hey, I think you deserve a snack.
[01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:10.720]   If you've never had Nature Box pineapple rings,
[01:55:10.720 --> 01:55:13.000]   you've got to get these.
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:14.680]   First of all, read the ingredient list.
[01:55:14.680 --> 01:55:17.240]   Dried pineapple.
[01:55:17.240 --> 01:55:18.080]   That's all?
[01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:19.520]   No sugar, no cell fights, nothing.
[01:55:19.520 --> 01:55:20.680]   Just dried pineapple.
[01:55:20.680 --> 01:55:21.480]   And I don't know how they do it.
[01:55:21.480 --> 01:55:23.400]   The technology, I don't know what.
[01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:24.840]   They're perfect.
[01:55:24.840 --> 01:55:26.800]   They're not too chewy, not too soft.
[01:55:26.800 --> 01:55:27.760]   They're moist with--
[01:55:27.760 --> 01:55:28.720]   They're not too hot.
[01:55:28.720 --> 01:55:29.400]   Would you like some?
[01:55:29.400 --> 01:55:29.880]   I want one.
[01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:31.440]   Now, one of the things-- first of all,
[01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:33.920]   Nature Box delivers snacks to your home, monthly boxes,
[01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:34.720]   buy mail.
[01:55:34.720 --> 01:55:36.880]   They have hundreds of snacks, all kinds.
[01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:37.840]   They have vegan.
[01:55:37.840 --> 01:55:39.280]   They have gluten-free.
[01:55:39.280 --> 01:55:42.120]   They have sweet, savory, spicy.
[01:55:42.120 --> 01:55:44.080]   They're kind of like a snack laboratory.
[01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:46.080]   But all the snacks are designed by nutritionists
[01:55:46.080 --> 01:55:48.720]   to be helpful, never any high fructose corn syrup
[01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:52.000]   or trans fats, zero artificial colors or flavors,
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:54.720]   just good stuff that you'd want to snack on.
[01:55:54.720 --> 01:55:56.680]   Oh, just take a whiff of that pineapple ring.
[01:55:56.680 --> 01:55:58.560]   That's so awesome.
[01:55:58.560 --> 01:56:00.760]   Now, some of you like sweets.
[01:56:00.760 --> 01:56:02.840]   Alex, you look like you might like whole wheat chocolate chip
[01:56:02.840 --> 01:56:03.840]   cookie bites.
[01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:04.340]   Really?
[01:56:04.340 --> 01:56:05.280]   I wouldn't do that.
[01:56:05.280 --> 01:56:05.800]   That sounds fun.
[01:56:05.800 --> 01:56:10.920]   Yeah, mini Belgian waffles, watermelon mini stars.
[01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:12.240]   You know, it's funny.
[01:56:12.240 --> 01:56:15.800]   I just made-- I saw it in Instructables
[01:56:15.800 --> 01:56:21.200]   for making LEGO gummy bears, gummy candies.
[01:56:21.200 --> 01:56:22.240]   Easy to do.
[01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:25.320]   So I went and I ordered some Star Wars ice cube trays.
[01:56:25.320 --> 01:56:27.680]   And I made Darth Vader gummy bears.
[01:56:27.680 --> 01:56:29.400]   And I guess it's not a bear.
[01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:30.680]   Gummy vaters.
[01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:33.080]   I made a R2D.
[01:56:33.080 --> 01:56:34.120]   It was really fun.
[01:56:34.120 --> 01:56:35.800]   So I kind of know what you put in.
[01:56:35.800 --> 01:56:37.760]   And these are even better.
[01:56:37.760 --> 01:56:40.280]   Apple juice, puree, apple juice, natural flavor,
[01:56:40.280 --> 01:56:42.320]   pectin, black carrot juice, concentrate for color,
[01:56:42.320 --> 01:56:44.520]   and such as fiber to give it some chew.
[01:56:44.520 --> 01:56:46.040]   These are the watermelon mini stars.
[01:56:46.040 --> 01:56:46.960]   Good stuff.
[01:56:46.960 --> 01:56:48.680]   So your kids can eat them.
[01:56:48.680 --> 01:56:49.400]   You will eat them.
[01:56:49.400 --> 01:56:50.440]   Your employees will eat them.
[01:56:50.440 --> 01:56:51.720]   These are resealable bags.
[01:56:51.720 --> 01:56:53.160]   So you don't have to eat them all up.
[01:56:53.160 --> 01:56:55.720]   And we're going to get you your first box on us.
[01:56:55.720 --> 01:56:57.880]   You just pay $2 shipping and handling
[01:56:57.880 --> 01:57:02.240]   when you go to naturebox.com/twit.
[01:57:02.240 --> 01:57:05.320]   These are the best pineapple things you've ever had.
[01:57:05.320 --> 01:57:06.800]   We actually-- and you can do this.
[01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:07.600]   They're always too sweet.
[01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:09.680]   Like when you get the ones that are really thick in there.
[01:57:09.680 --> 01:57:10.880]   You can pick one snack.
[01:57:10.880 --> 01:57:12.800]   You just have the whole box be one snack.
[01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:16.600]   We get two or three pineapple snacks every month.
[01:57:16.600 --> 01:57:19.000]   Naturebox, flavorful snacks made with ingredients
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:19.520]   you can trust.
[01:57:19.520 --> 01:57:20.560]   You're going to love them.
[01:57:20.560 --> 01:57:23.040]   And it's a nice thing when your naturebox comes.
[01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:24.880]   They put out new snacks every single month.
[01:57:24.880 --> 01:57:26.360]   So you'll never get bored.
[01:57:26.360 --> 01:57:28.480]   And if you don't like a snack, you can experiment.
[01:57:28.480 --> 01:57:29.880]   They have a smart snack guarantee.
[01:57:29.880 --> 01:57:32.280]   There's never anything that you don't love.
[01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:33.920]   If you find something you don't like, just tell them.
[01:57:33.920 --> 01:57:36.400]   And they'll replace it in the next month's box.
[01:57:36.400 --> 01:57:36.880]   It's easy.
[01:57:36.880 --> 01:57:37.600]   It's satisfying.
[01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:38.640]   It's delicious.
[01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:39.840]   And my mouth is watering.
[01:57:39.840 --> 01:57:41.080]   It's naturebox.
[01:57:41.080 --> 01:57:44.000]   Right now, get your first box on them,
[01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:45.760]   pay just $2 shipping.
[01:57:45.760 --> 01:57:51.160]   Naturebox.com/twit.
[01:57:51.160 --> 01:57:52.160]   A couple of--
[01:57:52.160 --> 01:57:54.200]   And I did not eat before we do that, Alex.
[01:57:54.200 --> 01:57:55.280]   I am really hungry.
[01:57:55.280 --> 01:57:55.960]   I'm so sorry.
[01:57:55.960 --> 01:57:56.960]   I'm actually about to cry.
[01:57:56.960 --> 01:57:59.200]   And if there were any way I could push you these snacks,
[01:57:59.200 --> 01:57:59.400]   I would.
[01:57:59.400 --> 01:58:00.880]   But see if you were here, Alex.
[01:58:00.880 --> 01:58:03.840]   You'd have tequila and snacks.
[01:58:03.840 --> 01:58:07.240]   I promise I will come back with a minute.
[01:58:07.240 --> 01:58:09.760]   All I can say is it's really tasty.
[01:58:09.760 --> 01:58:10.960]   It's really good.
[01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:13.920]   So what's rub that in a little bit?
[01:58:13.920 --> 01:58:15.400]   My blood.
[01:58:15.400 --> 01:58:17.680]   Our publisher, Jason Weisberger,
[01:58:17.680 --> 01:58:19.360]   Warren Boring's publisher Jason Weisberger,
[01:58:19.360 --> 01:58:22.920]   had a sample of those at his house one time.
[01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:25.920]   And I think I stole most of the box.
[01:58:25.920 --> 01:58:26.400]   Yeah.
[01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:26.960]   They were really good.
[01:58:26.960 --> 01:58:28.840]   I'm very picky about this kind of stuff.
[01:58:28.840 --> 01:58:29.560]   No, it's good.
[01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:32.680]   I never buy fruit that has sulfur on it because--
[01:58:32.680 --> 01:58:33.680]   Yeah.
[01:58:33.680 --> 01:58:34.200]   Right.
[01:58:34.200 --> 01:58:34.680]   --I just don't like it.
[01:58:34.680 --> 01:58:36.480]   They do that to preserve it.
[01:58:36.480 --> 01:58:38.120]   But it's not good for you, I don't think.
[01:58:38.120 --> 01:58:39.680]   Anyway, I wouldn't want to eat it.
[01:58:39.680 --> 01:58:41.680]   There's no sulfites, no sulfur.
[01:58:41.680 --> 01:58:43.280]   It's just pineapple.
[01:58:43.280 --> 01:58:44.080]   I love that.
[01:58:44.080 --> 01:58:45.080]   Really yummy snacks.
[01:58:45.080 --> 01:58:47.000]   Not just the dried fruits, but all of their snacks
[01:58:47.000 --> 01:58:48.520]   are super yummy.
[01:58:48.520 --> 01:58:51.040]   Jenny, you should come back and do all the ads.
[01:58:51.040 --> 01:58:51.800]   You're great.
[01:58:51.800 --> 01:58:54.160]   And I'm jealous of all the locals.
[01:58:54.160 --> 01:58:55.520]   I love it.
[01:58:55.520 --> 01:58:56.800]   Real quickly, we're going through a few--
[01:58:56.800 --> 01:58:58.240]   I know we're going long here.
[01:58:58.240 --> 01:58:59.560]   I just love you guys.
[01:58:59.560 --> 01:59:01.880]   And it's so much fun to spend a Sunday afternoon with you.
[01:59:01.880 --> 01:59:06.440]   Amazon was forced to redo their deals for e-books.
[01:59:06.440 --> 01:59:09.240]   Allowing publishers to set their own prices.
[01:59:09.240 --> 01:59:10.600]   What did publishers do?
[01:59:10.600 --> 01:59:12.160]   They jacked the prices up.
[01:59:12.160 --> 01:59:13.840]   What happened to e-book sales?
[01:59:13.840 --> 01:59:15.440]   They plummeted.
[01:59:15.440 --> 01:59:19.280]   E-book prices.
[01:59:19.280 --> 01:59:20.680]   They were the least surprising news stories.
[01:59:20.680 --> 01:59:21.440]   I know.
[01:59:21.440 --> 01:59:23.000]   Who didn't think it was going to happen?
[01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:23.520]   Yeah.
[01:59:23.520 --> 01:59:26.040]   Publishers are really not economists.
[01:59:26.040 --> 01:59:28.160]   And this is most obvious.
[01:59:28.160 --> 01:59:29.520]   What else was going to happen?
[01:59:29.520 --> 01:59:32.080]   The five biggest publishers' average cost of books
[01:59:32.080 --> 01:59:36.240]   in the Kindle bookstore $10.81, all other 2015 e-books
[01:59:36.240 --> 01:59:40.600]   on the site, average price $4.95.
[01:59:40.600 --> 01:59:45.120]   Once you get over $10, the common wisdom is,
[01:59:45.120 --> 01:59:46.960]   nobody's going to buy it.
[01:59:46.960 --> 01:59:49.760]   Jonathan Franzen's new novel, and I love Franzen.
[01:59:49.760 --> 01:59:52.960]   It's called "Purity $15 for an e-book."
[01:59:52.960 --> 01:59:56.240]   I think people go-- but this didn't cost anything to print.
[01:59:56.240 --> 01:59:58.400]   I have to admit, I buy technical manuals.
[01:59:58.400 --> 01:59:59.600]   So they're more-- what the books--
[01:59:59.600 --> 02:00:02.400]   The print book for "Purity" is $14.
[02:00:02.400 --> 02:00:03.680]   And-- wait a minute.
[02:00:03.680 --> 02:00:06.000]   No, I'm sorry.
[02:00:06.000 --> 02:00:08.600]   The hardcover-- I'm sorry, I switched it around.
[02:00:08.600 --> 02:00:12.000]   The print book is $15.10.
[02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:14.360]   The e-books $14.99, $0.11 less.
[02:00:14.360 --> 02:00:15.920]   It should be a little less than this.
[02:00:15.920 --> 02:00:16.920]   Don't you think?
[02:00:16.920 --> 02:00:20.160]   But Leo, the print book makes a delicious snack.
[02:00:20.160 --> 02:00:21.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:00:21.640 --> 02:00:22.840]   You know, but that's the point.
[02:00:22.840 --> 02:00:24.360]   If I'm going to pay $15 for the book,
[02:00:24.360 --> 02:00:26.320]   I'm going to get the print version then.
[02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:27.840]   I'm not going to get the e-book version.
[02:00:27.840 --> 02:00:28.600]   Well, maybe not.
[02:00:28.600 --> 02:00:29.680]   I don't like books.
[02:00:29.680 --> 02:00:32.040]   I do not like carrying things around.
[02:00:32.040 --> 02:00:33.200]   I think I'm so space.
[02:00:33.200 --> 02:00:36.520]   Like, I won't even buy anything that's on paper.
[02:00:36.520 --> 02:00:37.440]   Like, I just--
[02:00:37.440 --> 02:00:39.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:00:39.360 --> 02:00:41.240]   It's funny that Jenny would write this article.
[02:00:41.240 --> 02:00:43.840]   Find out when your name was popular with baby name
[02:00:43.840 --> 02:00:45.080]   explorer.
[02:00:45.080 --> 02:00:45.840]   I'm not in there.
[02:00:45.840 --> 02:00:46.520]   I'm guessing.
[02:00:46.520 --> 02:00:47.520]   Interesting.
[02:00:47.520 --> 02:00:48.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000]   The Jenny is not in that list.
[02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:50.600]   How ironic.
[02:00:50.600 --> 02:00:51.600]   No.
[02:00:51.600 --> 02:00:52.100]   No.
[02:00:52.100 --> 02:00:54.000]   Of course, I looked up Pat.
[02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:55.000]   Yeah.
[02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:55.960]   Remember the SNL?
[02:00:55.960 --> 02:00:56.600]   Yeah.
[02:00:56.600 --> 02:00:58.080]   The ambiguously-- yeah.
[02:00:58.080 --> 02:01:00.840]   1940 was really big for Pat.
[02:01:00.840 --> 02:01:03.600]   By the way, the blue line is baby boys.
[02:01:03.600 --> 02:01:05.440]   The pink line's baby girls.
[02:01:05.440 --> 02:01:08.040]   And so evidently, in the early '60s,
[02:01:08.040 --> 02:01:09.680]   it was very ambiguous.
[02:01:09.680 --> 02:01:12.360]   Yeah, 1960 and equal number of boys and girls were named Pat.
[02:01:12.360 --> 02:01:13.240]   Very interesting.
[02:01:13.240 --> 02:01:14.680]   So that explains it.
[02:01:14.680 --> 02:01:16.680]   Mine was not anywhere near when I was--
[02:01:16.680 --> 02:01:17.240]   Alex.
[02:01:17.240 --> 02:01:17.920]   Let's do Alex.
[02:01:17.920 --> 02:01:20.760]   I think we know some people named Alex.
[02:01:20.760 --> 02:01:22.040]   Is it Alexander or Alex?
[02:01:22.040 --> 02:01:22.400]   Oh.
[02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:22.400]   Oh.
[02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:23.400]   Mine's Alexander.
[02:01:23.400 --> 02:01:24.240]   I think they--
[02:01:24.240 --> 02:01:24.600]   So--
[02:01:24.600 --> 02:01:25.920]   Yeah, I'm standing up.
[02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:26.640]   Go by Alex.
[02:01:26.640 --> 02:01:27.800]   Looks like 1995.
[02:01:27.800 --> 02:01:29.200]   Because it's a huge client.
[02:01:29.200 --> 02:01:29.560]   Big.
[02:01:29.560 --> 02:01:30.720]   And it's just died off.
[02:01:30.720 --> 02:01:33.080]   Nobody wants to be Alexander.
[02:01:33.080 --> 02:01:34.080]   Nobody wants--
[02:01:34.080 --> 02:01:36.240]   But I have to watch a new show they don't.
[02:01:36.240 --> 02:01:38.880]   Z-E-N-I, Jenny, there's no--
[02:01:38.880 --> 02:01:38.880]   No.
[02:01:38.880 --> 02:01:40.880]   Sorry.
[02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:43.160]   Wow, you even get a pop-up.
[02:01:43.160 --> 02:01:45.040]   It's not in the baby named database.
[02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:46.360]   Sorry.
[02:01:46.360 --> 02:01:47.520]   Xavier is--
[02:01:47.520 --> 02:01:48.520]   Javier.
[02:01:48.520 --> 02:01:49.920]   Javier.
[02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:52.120]   I bet Leo's in there.
[02:01:52.120 --> 02:01:54.360]   Leo was really popular in the '20s.
[02:01:54.360 --> 02:01:56.320]   It's on the rise, man.
[02:01:56.320 --> 02:01:57.560]   It's coming back.
[02:01:57.560 --> 02:01:58.920]   We're coming back, baby.
[02:01:58.920 --> 02:01:59.520]   That's all you.
[02:01:59.520 --> 02:01:59.880]   That's all you.
[02:01:59.880 --> 02:02:01.680]   Leo peaked in 1918.
[02:02:01.680 --> 02:02:02.200]   Look at it.
[02:02:02.200 --> 02:02:02.960]   It's spiking.
[02:02:02.960 --> 02:02:06.960]   And then plummeted to its low in 1990.
[02:02:06.960 --> 02:02:07.880]   But it is spiking.
[02:02:07.880 --> 02:02:10.360]   It's now 0.1% of all babies are named Leo.
[02:02:10.360 --> 02:02:13.120]   I'm wondering, you've seen that since you were on TV,
[02:02:13.120 --> 02:02:14.000]   it's been spiking.
[02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:15.360]   Do you think they're naming them after me?
[02:02:15.360 --> 02:02:15.840]   I think so.
[02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:16.360]   I think you're--
[02:02:16.360 --> 02:02:17.200]   You know, my--
[02:02:17.200 --> 02:02:20.840]   I reconnected with my first girlfriend on Facebook.
[02:02:20.840 --> 02:02:22.600]   This is one of the things Facebook is good for, right?
[02:02:22.600 --> 02:02:25.000]   First girlfriend ever.
[02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:26.320]   Kathy.
[02:02:26.320 --> 02:02:29.800]   And we were high school sweethearts.
[02:02:29.800 --> 02:02:34.960]   And I found out that her son was named Leo.
[02:02:34.960 --> 02:02:36.280]   And I thought, oh, dear.
[02:02:36.280 --> 02:02:39.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:02:39.040 --> 02:02:42.920]   And she swears that that has nothing to do with me.
[02:02:42.920 --> 02:02:43.920]   Awkward.
[02:02:43.920 --> 02:02:44.840]   Awkward.
[02:02:44.840 --> 02:02:45.800]   Yeah, just a little bit.
[02:02:45.800 --> 02:02:49.120]   Don't tell your husband.
[02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:51.120]   Awkward.
[02:02:51.120 --> 02:02:52.640]   Snapchat is now--
[02:02:52.640 --> 02:02:56.200]   I mean, Snapchat video has gone through the roof.
[02:02:56.200 --> 02:02:58.280]   Any of you use Snapchat?
[02:02:58.280 --> 02:02:59.120]   Too old.
[02:02:59.120 --> 02:03:00.960]   I'm not cool enough.
[02:03:00.960 --> 02:03:05.520]   I think you could Snapchat that picture of you lying what
[02:03:05.520 --> 02:03:07.160]   appears to be naked in your squash.
[02:03:07.160 --> 02:03:15.240]   Every person young enough to be using Snapchat would go--
[02:03:15.240 --> 02:03:16.600]   [SCREAMS]
[02:03:16.600 --> 02:03:18.480]   I tried to use Snapchat.
[02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:22.360]   Nick Bilton and Baritone de Thurston are all in on Snapchat,
[02:03:22.360 --> 02:03:22.880]   right?
[02:03:22.880 --> 02:03:23.440]   I don't understand.
[02:03:23.440 --> 02:03:24.400]   And they came on the show.
[02:03:24.400 --> 02:03:26.360]   They said, you've got to use Snapchat.
[02:03:26.360 --> 02:03:27.640]   It's the biggest thing.
[02:03:27.640 --> 02:03:31.120]   This was actually when they had just launched the new discover
[02:03:31.120 --> 02:03:32.720]   feature of Snapchat.
[02:03:32.720 --> 02:03:37.920]   And I said, but look, if I put work into this big production,
[02:03:37.920 --> 02:03:41.120]   my big Snapchat story, I want it to be preserved.
[02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:43.440]   But after a day, it's gone.
[02:03:43.440 --> 02:03:46.800]   What's the app that teens and tweens who
[02:03:46.800 --> 02:03:50.360]   are too cool to be using Snapchat or using?
[02:03:50.360 --> 02:03:51.440]   Cyberdust.
[02:03:51.440 --> 02:03:52.240]   Cyberdust?
[02:03:52.240 --> 02:03:54.240]   Oh, that's the one where nobody knows you exist.
[02:03:54.240 --> 02:03:55.680]   That's Mark Cuban's app.
[02:03:55.680 --> 02:03:57.160]   Yeah, it just appears and disappears.
[02:03:57.160 --> 02:03:59.560]   Doesn't that make it not interesting immediately?
[02:03:59.560 --> 02:04:00.920]   He posts interesting things on it.
[02:04:00.920 --> 02:04:01.720]   Mark Cuban?
[02:04:01.720 --> 02:04:03.480]   Yeah, it's like-- there was actually
[02:04:03.480 --> 02:04:06.440]   some good stuff that just appears and then disappears.
[02:04:06.440 --> 02:04:11.080]   I'm just jealous because he invented internet on the radio.
[02:04:11.080 --> 02:04:12.640]   I mean, radio on the internet.
[02:04:12.640 --> 02:04:13.360]   Actually--
[02:04:13.360 --> 02:04:14.360]   Wait a minute.
[02:04:14.360 --> 02:04:15.440]   We can do internet on the radio.
[02:04:15.440 --> 02:04:16.440]   In and of the radio.
[02:04:16.440 --> 02:04:17.840]   It's not too late.
[02:04:17.840 --> 02:04:20.360]   You know, if you're going to have a loud, mouth rich guy
[02:04:20.360 --> 02:04:22.440]   run for president, how come it couldn't be Mark Cuban?
[02:04:22.440 --> 02:04:23.600]   Yeah, there's a good point.
[02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:25.000]   That would be fun.
[02:04:25.000 --> 02:04:29.440]   You find to have Mark Cuban debating Donald Trump.
[02:04:29.440 --> 02:04:31.000]   That would be awesome.
[02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:32.800]   Oh my god.
[02:04:32.800 --> 02:04:35.200]   Let's start a draft Cuban movement.
[02:04:35.200 --> 02:04:36.240]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:04:36.240 --> 02:04:37.080]   I can't take that.
[02:04:37.080 --> 02:04:38.480]   Our poor country can't take that.
[02:04:38.480 --> 02:04:39.040]   Oh my god.
[02:04:39.040 --> 02:04:39.880]   It would just--
[02:04:39.880 --> 02:04:41.840]   It would be--
[02:04:41.840 --> 02:04:44.160]   It would fall off the edge of the earth.
[02:04:44.160 --> 02:04:47.920]   So who's still posting on Snapchat?
[02:04:47.920 --> 02:04:50.240]   Snappa Tunday.
[02:04:50.240 --> 02:04:52.760]   Barretunday is right up there.
[02:04:52.760 --> 02:04:54.000]   But here's the point.
[02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:55.200]   New story.
[02:04:55.200 --> 02:04:59.000]   4 billion daily video views in April.
[02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:02.720]   That's double what it was getting at the end of 2014.
[02:05:02.720 --> 02:05:05.040]   4 billion every day.
[02:05:05.040 --> 02:05:08.920]   And these brands that are spending money,
[02:05:08.920 --> 02:05:12.720]   like Comedy Central, People, Vice ESPN, apparently
[02:05:12.720 --> 02:05:15.280]   are doing great.
[02:05:15.280 --> 02:05:19.200]   Deals with Major League Baseball, Live Nation.
[02:05:19.200 --> 02:05:20.600]   Now there's, of course, that question.
[02:05:20.600 --> 02:05:23.480]   Because Facebook counts a view after like a second.
[02:05:23.480 --> 02:05:26.800]   There's some question where their Snapchat
[02:05:26.800 --> 02:05:28.320]   is how they're counting it.
[02:05:28.320 --> 02:05:30.200]   They wouldn't say.
[02:05:30.200 --> 02:05:32.320]   Facebook changed its video algorithm,
[02:05:32.320 --> 02:05:33.640]   I want to say about a month ago.
[02:05:33.640 --> 02:05:34.120]   Oh good.
[02:05:34.120 --> 02:05:35.800]   And really cut down the number of reported views.
[02:05:35.800 --> 02:05:37.000]   Because it was insane.
[02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:40.360]   It hurt my ego because I saw my video views decline by a lot.
[02:05:40.360 --> 02:05:40.360]   Right.
[02:05:40.360 --> 02:05:41.600]   And I should try to correct it.
[02:05:41.600 --> 02:05:44.200]   But that was after the piece calling Facebook
[02:05:44.200 --> 02:05:45.800]   a liar by a video tube star named--
[02:05:45.800 --> 02:05:46.300]   Yes.
[02:05:46.300 --> 02:05:47.480]   I can't remember his name.
[02:05:47.480 --> 02:05:48.240]   Video tube.
[02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:49.680]   Video tube.
[02:05:49.680 --> 02:05:50.680]   Yeah.
[02:05:50.680 --> 02:05:54.360]   But he also pointed out that Facebook was not doing all
[02:05:54.360 --> 02:05:57.280]   it should to prevent pirated videos on Facebook.
[02:05:57.280 --> 02:05:58.720]   And they've responded to that as well.
[02:05:58.720 --> 02:06:01.840]   They are now doing a content ID thing on Facebook.
[02:06:01.840 --> 02:06:03.880]   So I think they listen anyway.
[02:06:03.880 --> 02:06:06.360]   And if they're going to get video creators to move from
[02:06:06.360 --> 02:06:07.920]   YouTube, they've got to.
[02:06:07.920 --> 02:06:11.160]   Very important.
[02:06:11.160 --> 02:06:12.320]   I think we can wrap it up.
[02:06:12.320 --> 02:06:14.560]   I'll just one quick note.
[02:06:14.560 --> 02:06:18.040]   I like to mention these technology pioneers.
[02:06:18.040 --> 02:06:19.440]   I think they're not well remembered.
[02:06:19.440 --> 02:06:25.000]   James L. Flanagan passed away at the age of 89 this week.
[02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:27.240]   He would-- day before his 90th birthday.
[02:06:27.240 --> 02:06:28.040]   Why do you care?
[02:06:28.040 --> 02:06:32.760]   He was at Bell Labs, wrote a seminal article, which
[02:06:32.760 --> 02:06:35.720]   unfortunately is still behind a pay wall in 1976.
[02:06:35.720 --> 02:06:38.520]   Computers that talk and listen.
[02:06:38.520 --> 02:06:41.000]   Man, machine communication by voice.
[02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:44.640]   If you like Siri, if you like Google now, if you like Cortana,
[02:06:44.640 --> 02:06:48.000]   you can thank James L. Flanagan, whose research really
[02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:53.000]   made it possible for computers to listen and respond
[02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:55.200]   to what we say.
[02:06:55.200 --> 02:06:59.080]   Also, for MP3s, efficient digital transmission of human voice
[02:06:59.080 --> 02:07:01.080]   and a lot more.
[02:07:01.080 --> 02:07:04.560]   Dr. Flanagan passed away this week at the age of 89.
[02:07:04.560 --> 02:07:07.080]   It always does come down to some person who thought this
[02:07:07.080 --> 02:07:08.080]   would be a good idea.
[02:07:08.080 --> 02:07:08.960]   And get everybody going.
[02:07:08.960 --> 02:07:09.880]   You know, right now.
[02:07:09.880 --> 02:07:13.880]   To think of that in the '60s and come up with a basic
[02:07:13.880 --> 02:07:16.440]   research that then, of course, it takes decades for it
[02:07:16.440 --> 02:07:17.720]   to make it to the market.
[02:07:17.720 --> 02:07:20.120]   It is another note to his fame.
[02:07:20.120 --> 02:07:24.800]   Is he was one of six acoustical experts who examined
[02:07:24.800 --> 02:07:28.160]   the 18 and 1/2 minutes of missing audio from the Nixon
[02:07:28.160 --> 02:07:30.880]   tapes during Watergate and determined that they must have
[02:07:30.880 --> 02:07:33.400]   been erased on purpose.
[02:07:33.400 --> 02:07:37.080]   So he had a little bit of a footnote in history as well.
[02:07:37.080 --> 02:07:38.520]   That's when Rosemary Wood showed this.
[02:07:38.520 --> 02:07:39.480]   There were people who played in the fame actually.
[02:07:39.480 --> 02:07:39.960]   Stretch.
[02:07:39.960 --> 02:07:40.560]   Yeah, that's pretty cool.
[02:07:40.560 --> 02:07:41.200]   I would try some play.
[02:07:41.200 --> 02:07:42.200]   I love it.
[02:07:42.200 --> 02:07:42.800]   Well, you may.
[02:07:42.800 --> 02:07:43.480]   You're young.
[02:07:43.480 --> 02:07:45.120]   Time's not over.
[02:07:45.120 --> 02:07:46.240]   You may have a chance.
[02:07:46.240 --> 02:07:47.200]   You'll like it.
[02:07:47.200 --> 02:07:48.080]   OK, well, we'll see.
[02:07:48.080 --> 02:07:50.920]   And Alex pointed out, and I think this is a good thing,
[02:07:50.920 --> 02:07:53.400]   the judgment on the Silicon Valley.
[02:07:53.400 --> 02:07:57.520]   No poaching agreements that Apple, Google, and many others
[02:07:57.520 --> 02:07:58.480]   had made.
[02:07:58.480 --> 02:08:02.160]   This is a violation of trust law, antitrust law.
[02:08:02.160 --> 02:08:04.680]   You're not supposed to because it's bad for the employees.
[02:08:04.680 --> 02:08:07.560]   If you say, well, I won't hire anybody from your team.
[02:08:07.560 --> 02:08:09.480]   If you don't hire anybody from my team,
[02:08:09.480 --> 02:08:13.200]   $415 million settlement.
[02:08:13.200 --> 02:08:14.720]   Which is not that much money.
[02:08:14.720 --> 02:08:17.880]   Not when you divide it among 64,000 workers.
[02:08:17.880 --> 02:08:18.360]   Yeah.
[02:08:18.360 --> 02:08:20.960]   It's like $6,500 a piece.
[02:08:20.960 --> 02:08:24.560]   And given the scale of the suit and how many people
[02:08:24.560 --> 02:08:25.560]   it affected for how long--
[02:08:25.560 --> 02:08:27.760]   I mean, they're getting away with murder here.
[02:08:27.760 --> 02:08:29.800]   And these companies, Apple, Google, and so forth,
[02:08:29.800 --> 02:08:31.920]   have essentially endless money.
[02:08:31.920 --> 02:08:34.160]   And so just to walk with really less
[02:08:34.160 --> 02:08:36.680]   on the tap on the wrist from a broader perspective
[02:08:36.680 --> 02:08:37.760]   is I think a disappointment.
[02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:39.120]   But it's over now.
[02:08:39.120 --> 02:08:39.640]   It's done.
[02:08:39.640 --> 02:08:40.640]   Let me do it.
[02:08:40.640 --> 02:08:41.240]   Dance over.
[02:08:41.240 --> 02:08:43.520]   And as you point out, Facebook, not on that list,
[02:08:43.520 --> 02:08:44.480]   they did not agree.
[02:08:44.480 --> 02:08:45.480]   Yeah.
[02:08:45.480 --> 02:08:47.480]   Well, I think back then when this was going on,
[02:08:47.480 --> 02:08:49.800]   Facebook was so hot, they didn't want to disarm.
[02:08:49.800 --> 02:08:52.400]   I think they wanted to have the capability to approach
[02:08:52.400 --> 02:08:54.640]   because they could because they were growing so quickly.
[02:08:54.640 --> 02:08:55.160]   Right.
[02:08:55.160 --> 02:08:55.960]   But I was just--
[02:08:55.960 --> 02:08:57.520]   I think there was a pure need issue.
[02:08:57.520 --> 02:08:58.960]   They didn't have a choice.
[02:08:58.960 --> 02:09:01.840]   They had to steal people from all those companies
[02:09:01.840 --> 02:09:02.920]   to grow to get them--
[02:09:02.920 --> 02:09:04.400]   there's only--
[02:09:04.400 --> 02:09:07.640]   I mean, I know we talk about bringing people in.
[02:09:07.640 --> 02:09:09.240]   And we have enough programmers here in the United States.
[02:09:09.240 --> 02:09:11.720]   But there's really a small number of people--
[02:09:11.720 --> 02:09:13.720]   I mean, in the millions, but a small number of people
[02:09:13.720 --> 02:09:15.520]   that can do quality code.
[02:09:15.520 --> 02:09:17.600]   I mean, it just takes a lot of time and effort
[02:09:17.600 --> 02:09:21.840]   and to learn it well enough to do good structure.
[02:09:21.840 --> 02:09:23.440]   All right.
[02:09:23.440 --> 02:09:26.880]   I feel like the schoolmaster who is ready for the bell to ring,
[02:09:26.880 --> 02:09:28.560]   I'm going to release you all.
[02:09:28.560 --> 02:09:32.640]   Poor Jenny has already fallen asleep along with Shappy.
[02:09:32.640 --> 02:09:33.800]   It's just my chill out day.
[02:09:33.800 --> 02:09:35.800]   It's so cute.
[02:09:35.800 --> 02:09:36.960]   Oh my god.
[02:09:36.960 --> 02:09:38.160]   What are you going to do for--
[02:09:38.160 --> 02:09:40.960]   What are you doing for Labor Day, Jenny?
[02:09:40.960 --> 02:09:43.600]   Hanging out with my dog in my sweetie and playing on the beach.
[02:09:43.600 --> 02:09:44.960]   Nice.
[02:09:44.960 --> 02:09:46.920]   We love you so much.
[02:09:46.920 --> 02:09:50.200]   I am so glad that you're still with us,
[02:09:50.200 --> 02:09:55.800]   still making a smile, think, laugh, cry.
[02:09:55.800 --> 02:09:56.800]   You're just the greatest--
[02:09:56.800 --> 02:09:58.360]   boingboing.net.
[02:09:58.360 --> 02:10:00.800]   Wow, dot boingboing.net.
[02:10:00.800 --> 02:10:02.920]   If you want to go to the world of wonder.
[02:10:02.920 --> 02:10:04.080]   Chapp you'll be there.
[02:10:04.080 --> 02:10:04.920]   Chapp you'll be there.
[02:10:04.920 --> 02:10:06.440]   So will Jenny.
[02:10:06.440 --> 02:10:08.280]   So nice to see you again.
[02:10:08.280 --> 02:10:08.760]   Thank you.
[02:10:08.760 --> 02:10:11.280]   I feel like it's been ages and ages.
[02:10:11.280 --> 02:10:16.360]   I hope that you'll have me back and I'll have a puppy cam rigged up.
[02:10:16.360 --> 02:10:16.880]   Good.
[02:10:16.880 --> 02:10:17.720]   Even more stable.
[02:10:17.720 --> 02:10:19.680]   Speaking for the white male patriarchy.
[02:10:19.680 --> 02:10:22.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:10:22.640 --> 02:10:23.160]   Which I do.
[02:10:23.160 --> 02:10:26.800]   I don't know if you know that, but actually I am in charge.
[02:10:26.800 --> 02:10:28.760]   I thank you for your service.
[02:10:28.760 --> 02:10:29.960]   You're so cute.
[02:10:29.960 --> 02:10:37.600]   Alex Wilhelm, you're not so bad at yourself there.
[02:10:37.600 --> 02:10:38.600]   Alex will--
[02:10:38.600 --> 02:10:39.840]   I'm not going to touch that at all.
[02:10:39.840 --> 02:10:40.520]   No, no.
[02:10:40.520 --> 02:10:42.040]   I wish you would.
[02:10:42.040 --> 02:10:44.520]   Alex is at TechCrunch.com.
[02:10:44.520 --> 02:10:44.880]   Help me.
[02:10:44.880 --> 02:10:46.400]   Save me.
[02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:48.440]   And joins us from time to time.
[02:10:48.440 --> 02:10:52.400]   He's a very frequent contributor on TNT as well, where we love having him.
[02:10:52.400 --> 02:10:54.760]   Great to see you once again.
[02:10:54.760 --> 02:10:55.280]   Good to be here.
[02:10:55.280 --> 02:10:58.600]   The tequila is waiting next time.
[02:10:58.600 --> 02:10:59.040]   It is.
[02:10:59.040 --> 02:10:59.600]   On dinner.
[02:10:59.600 --> 02:11:00.440]   So--
[02:11:00.440 --> 02:11:04.320]   Tequila, dinner, pineapple rings, whatever you want.
[02:11:04.320 --> 02:11:04.840]   There we go.
[02:11:04.840 --> 02:11:06.440]   Mr. Alex, Lindsey, PixelCore.com.
[02:11:06.440 --> 02:11:08.280]   We didn't get a chance to talk about the DXO.
[02:11:08.280 --> 02:11:10.080]   But I think you talked about it on Macbreak.
[02:11:10.080 --> 02:11:11.600]   We believe people want to know more.
[02:11:11.600 --> 02:11:12.640]   I didn't talk about it on Macbreak.
[02:11:12.640 --> 02:11:13.120]   You didn't.
[02:11:13.120 --> 02:11:13.640]   But Andy--
[02:11:13.640 --> 02:11:14.360]   Andy did.
[02:11:14.360 --> 02:11:14.880]   Andy did.
[02:11:14.880 --> 02:11:17.400]   Well, next time you're on, maybe you can give us a little demo.
[02:11:17.400 --> 02:11:17.760]   Yeah, I know.
[02:11:17.760 --> 02:11:18.240]   It's great.
[02:11:18.240 --> 02:11:21.960]   This is a $600 camera that is an accessory for your--
[02:11:21.960 --> 02:11:22.320]   what?
[02:11:22.320 --> 02:11:22.960]   Your iPhone.
[02:11:22.960 --> 02:11:25.880]   It has a lightning cable port.
[02:11:25.880 --> 02:11:27.960]   You plug it into your phone, and it does--
[02:11:27.960 --> 02:11:29.560]   actually ordered one after you talked about it.
[02:11:29.560 --> 02:11:30.560]   It's so good.
[02:11:30.560 --> 02:11:32.200]   I now have to get an iPhone.
[02:11:32.200 --> 02:11:32.560]   But--
[02:11:32.560 --> 02:11:34.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:11:34.360 --> 02:11:36.360]   It's Tuesday.
[02:11:36.360 --> 02:11:38.960]   I think I'll be-- well, Friday I'll be in--
[02:11:38.960 --> 02:11:40.320]   I'll get-- I'll set the alarm.
[02:11:40.320 --> 02:11:41.560]   I pretty much don't go anywhere without it.
[02:11:41.560 --> 02:11:42.840]   I'll be back east, which means I'll
[02:11:42.840 --> 02:11:46.240]   have to get up at 3 in the morning.
[02:11:46.240 --> 02:11:50.080]   Or you want to stand in line for me on September 18?
[02:11:50.080 --> 02:11:51.000]   All right, we'll see.
[02:11:51.000 --> 02:11:52.440]   This is really cool.
[02:11:52.440 --> 02:11:53.400]   And we made the video.
[02:11:53.400 --> 02:11:56.040]   And you'll hear Alex's dulce it tones.
[02:11:56.040 --> 02:11:57.520]   It was supposed to be a scratch track.
[02:11:57.520 --> 02:11:58.880]   On the video at theXO.
[02:11:58.880 --> 02:12:00.880]   Ended up being the dot com.
[02:12:00.880 --> 02:12:01.480]   The whole thing.
[02:12:01.480 --> 02:12:02.640]   Thank you all for being here.
[02:12:02.640 --> 02:12:04.960]   We do this week in tech every Saturday afternoon,
[02:12:04.960 --> 02:12:07.200]   3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time,
[02:12:07.200 --> 02:12:09.320]   2,200 UTC on Twit.tv.
[02:12:09.320 --> 02:12:11.000]   We'd love it if you watched live.
[02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:12.600]   If you'd like to be in the studio audience,
[02:12:12.600 --> 02:12:14.120]   we'd love it if you would stop by.
[02:12:14.120 --> 02:12:15.640]   Thank you all for being here.

[02:12:17.280 --> 02:12:19.400]   We'll put out a chair for you, as you can see.
[02:12:19.400 --> 02:12:21.840]   Many more chairs than there were people.
[02:12:21.840 --> 02:12:22.160]   So--
[02:12:22.160 --> 02:12:22.880]   It happened.
[02:12:22.880 --> 02:12:23.320]   What happened?
[02:12:23.320 --> 02:12:23.920]   Well, it's laboring.
[02:12:23.920 --> 02:12:24.840]   That family that was here--
[02:12:24.840 --> 02:12:25.360]   Oh, it's laboring.
[02:12:25.360 --> 02:12:26.840]   The family was here left.
[02:12:26.840 --> 02:12:28.720]   They said, oh, it's going to be that show, eh?
[02:12:28.720 --> 02:12:29.680]   And they just took off.
[02:12:29.680 --> 02:12:30.880]   They ran as fast as they could.
[02:12:30.880 --> 02:12:31.320]   There's windows weekly.
[02:12:31.320 --> 02:12:32.480]   We'd love to have you here.
