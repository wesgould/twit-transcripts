[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Bandwidth for this weekend tech is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com/podcasting.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   [Music]
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   This is Twitch, this weekend tech, episode 57 for June 11th, 2006.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   VloggerCon.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   [Music]
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   Hi, this is Leo, one little show note before we begin.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   We recorded this show at VloggerCon on Friday, June 9th, 2006 at the Apple Store.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   Just before the show, I spoke with Robert Scoboe and indicated he might be thinking of leaving Microsoft.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   He asked me not to say anything, so I didn't.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Just a few short hours after we recorded the show, Robert announced to the world that in fact he was leaving and joining John Furrier's podcast.net.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   So the show you're about to hear is Robert Scoboe's last appearance as a Microsoft student. Enjoy.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   [Music]
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   And a very good day to you. I'm Leo LaPorte and we are doing Twitch once again from the Apple Store in San Francisco, California as part of VloggerCon.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   And there are a lot of Vloggers across from us doing their presentation. We'll meet some Vloggers as time goes by, but I can't think part of the problem with the term Vloggers.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   I'm not sure what it means. Everybody on this panel has done video on the internet, but is that a Vlog? I don't know.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   I'm not sure what it means to be on the panel starting from my left with Jason McCabe Calicana.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Thank you for having me. It's been my dream to be on the show.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   We've been quoting you on the show many, many times.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   You know what? I do get that information on a very regular basis.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Jason has been a long time member of the electronic community starting back in New York City.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Were you part of Sudo or just a...
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   radio show on Sudo, which was Josh Harris' company back in the streaming media days starting in '96, '97.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Long time ago.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   And he did actually... I used to be on his... he used to rent AM radio and then have a chatroom on Prodigy in '95.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   So that was the first interactive thing being done.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   It was part of like NYU's ITP program at the time. All kinds of crazy stuff. That was a fun one.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   You started the Silicon Alley reporter?
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Silicon Alley reporter, venture reporter, sold it to Dow Jones.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   That started WebLogz Inc., which produces, Engaged it in a number of other blogs and sold that to AOL.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   In 18 months he flipped that sucker.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   18 months, yeah. And I've been in AOL for about six months and I've been announcing some new stuff in a couple of weeks.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   So are you running WebLogz Inc., or are you doing some of the difficulty?
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Yeah, VEO WebLogz Inc., which is an American online company, American online company. It's a subsidiary.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   And I'm also running a couple of other departments at AOL. That'll be revealed shortly.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   But right now the only guy on this panel who's not actually doing video on the internet.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Me?
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   I have a number of video crews who work for me. I've got about six or seven full-time video people.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   So what you're saying is you have people who do that.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   I have people who do that.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   I don't know if you're saying that.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   We do video on joystick, video on Engaged it.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Engaged it is a lot of video, yeah.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Engaged it's, yeah, lots of video and, yeah, I've got two full-time predators on staff.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   We call them predators. Producer/editors.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   They can actually go find the person to interview them, cut the video and upload it.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   So we did a lot of that on joystick at E3.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   A lot of good video and some good video at CES this year.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Well, we're glad to get you on the show. We really appreciate it. There's a lot to talk about this week.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Patrick Norton is also here, DLTV. He's doing IPTV, both streaming and downloading.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Downloadable video. It's a good video on the web.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   We bring back memories doing that screen savers entrance.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Yeah, hot, sweaty and trying to figure out why it was running while I was being changed.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   No more than that.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   I'm running into a crowd of people.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   I just thought it would be fun to try it out that way.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Do you remember what Carter says?
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   There's Nix. He's here down from Canada.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Of course, she is the producer and host, predator of Command N, but also my co-host on Call for Health.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   It's great to have you.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Yeah, it's good to be here. We've been shooting Torrance in the city, which has been fantastic.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Torrance is a new show on G4Tek TV Canada, which is all about video podcast.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Yeah, we really take the best video podcast that we find on the internet and we put them together in one show per week.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   We find lots of great stuff. We featured lots of shows from people who are around here.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Well, it's your idea to come to VloggerCon. I didn't even know about VloggerCon till you mentioned it.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   This is an interesting event. We'll talk a little bit about what VloggerCon is all about.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Perfect.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Also, to my right job, C. Dvorak.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Hello, who is a cranky geek.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Look at this, you've got a little... On this thing, there's a little bitty camera.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   That's just a green light. Pay no attention to that.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   That's it.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   You're on the camera there.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Don't touch the lens.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   John's playing with my MacBook.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Oh, I got a screen done.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   It's so delicate.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   It's so delicate.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   It's a piece of art.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Let's try the old drug test.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Please not.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   We're actually in a weird situation. We're on the bridge at the Apple Store, which goes across the staircase.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   As people come in and they go up to the auditorium, that's because the VloggerCon convention has a meet.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   The Vlogger's event in the auditorium across from us.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   But what's weird is they're actually is gaps, so we could drop things.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   I know, I'm hoping they're not an earthquake.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Watch those twit brushes because they could go right through the crack there.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   We could go by the way.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   We've got a convention to block that orc slash blossom.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Thank you very much.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   I have a funny, one of the funniest posts I've ever done right now. It's online. It's a cat.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Has anyone seen this thing, by the way? It's a... Some jokers put a cat toy on an overhead fan, and this cat's reaching for it, and then he gets caught in it.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Well, it's not bad. He catches, goes around and around, and gets thrown against the wall. It's quite humorous, actually.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   It's a video, right?
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   It's a video.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   It's very real.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   It's actually somebody who put together like a 25 minute collection of viral videos of cats doing cats doing weird stupid videos.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Yeah, definitely worth checking.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   You can go to UCAT.com.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Remember the scan, the cat scans? Remember that?
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   They had scans of cats. People would upload their kitty on a scanner, and they would scan it.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   Yeah, cat people plus cat people.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   I don't remember that.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   That combination.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   One more person to introduce. Actually, there's going to be lots more coming through, but I'm really thrilled Andrew Barron is here.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   I called Andrew Cogdon last week, but that was just a trick.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   There is Andrew Cogdon, though, and he's here, actually.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Really?
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   The evil genius behind the incredibly successful Rocketbook, and I confused you with Amanda Cogdon, who is your host on Rocketbook.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   But I didn't really. I knew you were in Amanda.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   I just, he was my mouth.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   I don't confuse you.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Oh, I don't have any expectations.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Are you a vlogger? What is a vlogger?
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   What is a vlogger?
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   You were just fascinated to know him.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Well, it's interesting that there's a lot of different terms that are being thrown around right now, but video blogging or vlogging, you know, the shortened word for it is just very much like blogging.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Which originally Rocketbook kind of was. But it's moved more to a show now, wouldn't you say a daily show?
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   It originally started as a daily show.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   It was always happy.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   And we just, we use blog software. We are talking to bloggers. We get a lot of our news from blogs. We have comments and we archive everything, and it's kind of short.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   And, you know, it uses a lot of the same sort of style.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   How many page use do you get a month?
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   How many days do you get a month?
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   How many do you get a day?
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Well, a month is a number I can tell.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   We'll do it.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   We'll do it.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   We'll do it.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   We'll do it.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   How many days?
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   We have around 300,000 typically.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   You're going to wreck the place.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   How do you pay your band with bills?
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Well, we actually, I mean, when we got started band with costs were 90% of what they are today.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Today it's only 10%, in other words, of what it was just a year and a half. So it's just, it's so cheap.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   I mean, even today it's our biggest cost, but it's really nothing at all, even to mention.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   You get 300, oh, here come the cops.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Sorry about that.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   You get 300,000 a day though, partly because when you go to your page they start watching the show, right?
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   But you're counting from, you fully watch the internet.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   You can pull down those.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Pull down those.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   That's it.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Not just on our site because we distribute it on so many different platforms like on Tivo or, you know, bit torrent distributions, all kinds of stuff.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   That's amazing.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   How many people, do you have any indication on how many people open it?
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   That's the statistic I'm always dealing with is.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   Now don't bring this up, because advertisers keep saying that to me.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   They say, well, yeah, you got the right downloads.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   But of course they all open them.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   But see, you can ask the same thing in PC Magazine.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   How many people subscribe, but don't read it.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   You can't ask that of a webpage.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   The other thing too is a lot of times with our shows, like a lot of people will watch them at work and stuff and they share it kind of with their friends.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   So they like three people sit around and watch.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Pass around, see.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   Pass around.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   I remember that from the magazine.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   Exactly.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   That's why I got that.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   At PC Magazine, we have a multiplier by the number of issues and there's so many people read.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   About 2.2 people or so like read.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   One thing you can say for sure though, because at least unlike television where Nielsen rating is a guess.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   You at least know how many people stand up.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Not just a guess.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   These guys are statistical geniuses.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   I have a way to only find people smoking.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   I'm telling you.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   Now actually I defend them.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   Defending Nielsen does a good job.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   You're one of the few, John, in fact.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   I think they do a job.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Well at local television I don't say they do a good job, but nationally I think they do.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   Another voice joins the party here.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   Robert Scobull, the scobullizer is here.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   He is perhaps best known as a blogger.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   He's best known as Scobull.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   He's best known as Scobull.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   More than anything else.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   He's the face of Microsoft.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   He's Microsoft.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   He's Microsoft.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   Shill.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   I told that one of the others.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.

[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.

[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   I told that one of the people who made it.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   It's no spam.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   It gets no bad laser art.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   You get no bad problems.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   That's not the spam problem.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   That e-mail thing is overrated.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   It's funny you say that because there's been some people writing about that topic.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   They're saying that e-mail is dead.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   It's a piece of road data.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   It's an actual article of security focus.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   It's crazy.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   I'm a good spam filtering system like I use.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   Please, we want to give it one plug before we move on.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   You just go to the blog at devarc.org and click on it.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   I get no spam and you go right to Mark Prickel.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   I know he's listening now.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   Go to ctime.com.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   John, you bring up the lack of quality on content.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   I just got on HDTV and I sit there and watch the Discovery channel for hours on end.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   There's no content.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   There's the critics.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:53.240]   You've got to get to the
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:14:03.240]   news.
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.240]   Amber MacArthur, what is the vlog?
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:09.240]   I think that it's possible you can call it the same thing.
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:13.240]   There's video podcast, video blogs, vlogs, vidcast, whatever.
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.240]   There's a bunch of different names.
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:17.240]   I can't figure it out.
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.240]   It's a TV.
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:23.240]   You're here because you are people here who say I'm a video blogger.
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:25.240]   You're watching on the screen right now.
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:35.240]   You don't have to do with either A, what the technology is and which is distributed and/or how that particular person happens to identify with what they're doing.
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.240]   How big their ego is?
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.240]   Not necessarily what their entry point is.
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:45.240]   There are people here who would say that none of us are vloggers, even though we do video on the Internet.
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.240]   We don't count because we're not doing quote a video blog.
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.240]   It's easier to --
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.240]   I don't think you're doing a video podcasting.
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:57.240]   You know at least podcasting has to have RSS with enclosure spec, right?
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:03.240]   So if you don't distribute it over RSS with enclosures, it's not a podcast period.
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:07.240]   So it's purely defined based on the technological distribution.
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:11.240]   Blogging or video blogging can't --
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.240]   You're missing my point.
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.240]   He's talking purely semantically.
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.240]   My issue is cultural.
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.240]   You're at Kip dasky for your definition.
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.240]   What does it mean?
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:20.240]   What does it mean?
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.240]   The cultural part comes into the video blogging part.
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:24.240]   This is what's next.
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:32.240]   So now that we could take -- like Rocket Boom, for instance, fits into video podcasts because it's distributed with RSS enclosure.
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:39.240]   We call it a video blog because we personally identify with that medium, with the blogging medium.
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:42.240]   But you'll never really be a video blog.
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:46.240]   How do you identify what a blog is because it's so --
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:48.240]   It's a great area.
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.240]   Unfiltered or underbaked?
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:52.240]   Unfiltered.
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:59.240]   Unfiltered is the defined character of blogs because once you put editorial process on it, then it becomes a website.
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:02.240]   But there's always editorial process. I have editorial process here.
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.240]   Filtering.
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.240]   The personal --
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.240]   Personal.
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.240]   People come to a blog.
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.240]   They expect that it's your view of the world.
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.240]   You hit the publish key and nobody changed it.
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:12.240]   You hit the post-it's your view of the blog.
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:14.240]   You hit the post-it's view of the blog.

[00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:00.240]   What about the news TV?
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:03.240]   Look at the guys. It's just like Kevin and all the guys from System 3.
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.240]   It's made for the TV.
[00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:08.240]   That's what gets to the distinction right there.
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:11.240]   It's whether you distribute it on that platform
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:16.240]   or whether you identify the content of being specific for that platform.
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.240]   Again with Rock-It-Be-S does it.
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:21.240]   It's not IPTV because they're putting it on regular television.
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:22.240]   No, it's TV.
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:26.240]   It's TV but they're doing a new platform
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:28.240]   in which they're distributed on.
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.240]   Does that change the nature of the content?
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:33.240]   Not really. It's just a new distribution platform in that case.
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.240]   So you're focused on what the content is not the distribution?
[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:39.240]   IPTV is going to let TV stations or cable networks
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:43.240]   or telephone networks deliver new kind of video content.
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:47.240]   For instance, we have IPTV running in our OXs in Silicon Valley
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:51.240]   and we can get forward HD TV channels at the same time.
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:54.240]   So now I could watch a baseball game from four different
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:56.240]   managed points all on the same screen.
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.240]   It's interesting.
[00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:59.240]   Because that's exactly what happened on Friday
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.240]   in the House of Representatives.
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:04.240]   They proved a bill that allowed AT&T and Verizon,
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:07.240]   among other telcos, to start to make it easier for them
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:08.240]   to do subscription TV.
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.240]   I think this is a bluff.
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.240]   The House said that they're going to say
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:14.240]   a nationwide license, set cable companies which are sold
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:17.240]   and we learned this through Bitter Experience at Tech TV.
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:19.240]   You've got to go to every single town in the country
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.240]   with a bag of cash and a little black bag.
[00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.240]   You get your honeycomb.
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:23.240]   It's a big deal.
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.240]   It's a big deal.
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.240]   It's a big deal.
[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:26.240]   It's a big deal.
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:27.240]   It's a big deal.

[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:14.240]   It's a big deal.
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:21.240]   It was going to be a net neutrality provision ensuring that the telcos would not charge Google
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:22.240]   extra.
[00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:25.240]   We're not trying to charge carriers extra for carrying their content.
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.240]   That was thrown out by pretty resoundingly.
[00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.240]   That is at least the first of the--
[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:30.240]   Well, it was like 251-68.
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:31.240]   It wasn't that resounding.
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:32.240]   It was pretty much spread along--
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.240]   I don't know.
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:36.240]   It was about to be as a first defeat for the net neutrality forces.
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.240]   They say, "Well, we're not done yet.
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.240]   We'll go to the Senate neck."
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.240]   But it is a defeat for net neutrality.
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.240]   Go ahead.
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:46.240]   We saw on Lost Remote yesterday about the case where it looked like--
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:49.240]   I don't-- can't remember if it was AT&T or Time Warner.
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:51.240]   Somebody was blocking Craigslist.
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.240]   That was cost--
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:53.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:54.240]   I think Craigslist.
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.240]   Yeah.
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:56.240]   And so then of course--
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:57.240]   It was a bug in the software.
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:59.240]   It turned out that it was a bug, but it first--
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:02.240]   Yeah, but on tech meme it says that they did it, so it must be true.
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:05.240]   And it was the number one story on Dig, so it's true.
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:07.240]   Just like AOL blocked those--
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.240]   Yeah.
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:09.240]   AOL blocked the people who wanted--
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:11.240]   The story on--
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:13.240]   Except they sent their email, the punchline that was.
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:17.240]   The EFF sent an email without permission from the users they sent it to.
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.240]   They just all put their emails together.
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:24.240]   So they basically spammed to say, "Don't allow AOL to use anti-famine techniques."
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.240]   Wow.
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.240]   It was great.
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:31.240]   So what I noticed was my feeling--
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:33.240]   It was the first time where it sort of was like,
[00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:36.240]   "There's a gleaming example of exactly how it could work."
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:42.240]   And then as soon as everybody sort of jumped on Cox and was like,
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.240]   "What's going on?
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:44.240]   How could you do it?"
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:46.240]   And then they're like, "Oh, we had a bug.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.240]   Sorry."
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.240]   They said they're not--
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:49.240]   They said they're not.
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:50.240]   Okay, hold on.
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:51.240]   The question.
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:52.240]   How do you get here?
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.240]   Here's my question.
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:56.240]   Let's say one of the major telcos says,
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.240]   "We're going to go ahead and set up our tiers.
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:00.240]   If you pay extra money, we'll give you everything.
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.240]   It's not.
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.240]   We're going to give you this limited service."
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:06.240]   Why wouldn't that prevent the competitor to come along and say,
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:09.240]   "We're going to give you everything for this price?"
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:11.240]   But the competitor is in bed with these guys.
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:13.240]   This whole deal is a sweet deal.
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:14.240]   But no, I agree with you.
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.240]   The majority of our commission--
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:17.240]   Well, the market would take care of this because--
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.240]   They take care of this.
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.240]   They take care of this.
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:24.240]   They keep in mind, these guys own the last mile distribution of your house.
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:26.240]   So like I have cable modem.
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:29.240]   What am I going to do to replace that cable modem?
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:30.240]   Get a phone line?
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.240]   It depends on where you are.
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.240]   Some people don't have an option.
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:36.240]   Some people have the option of cable, DSL, Wi-Fi.
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:38.240]   They're experimenting with Wi-MAX, right?
[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.240]   But they're coming out with a huge number of communities.
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:42.240]   So many people don't have an option.
[00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:43.240]   Or not, but what?
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.240]   Just like a market.
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.240]   It's not available.
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:49.240]   I'm just telling you, these guys are good.
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:54.240]   There's no evidence that it's going in the opposite direction.
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:58.240]   It's going in the direction of a very few sources for getting connected.
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:59.240]   That's right.
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:00.240]   And those guys all work together.
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.240]   They have lunch with each other.
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.240]   And they basically collude.
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:05.240]   And that's what's going on.
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:08.240]   That's the only reason itself in that case.
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.240]   Do you think it's tourism, equity?
[00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.240]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:15.240]   And the fact of the matter is there's reasons where--
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:18.240]   Whoever heard of net neutrality like a year ago.
[00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:20.240]   I never heard of this term until recently.
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:24.240]   It's only cropping up because it's becoming apparent that something like this needed.
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:25.240]   That's a rumble.
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:28.240]   When Bell South is sitting up and going, we're going to basically segment.
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.240]   We're going to have preferred tiers.
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:32.240]   And this is a weird mix of your watching.
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:43.240]   You've got a bunch of engineers who are going, "Actually, we wrote a paper that said we can't actually deliver all of the bandwidth we've sold to anybody unless we quadrupled the price because we can't give the service unless we charge everybody like, you know."
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:45.240]   We have heard of net neutrality before.
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:49.240]   It was legislation of the telcos back in the '50s.
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:50.240]   It's always been.
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:53.240]   When they had a monopoly on how we called each other.
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:26:00.240]   Jason, you're in an interesting-- AOL is an interesting position. Both as a content provider and as one of the big internet service providers.
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:02.240]   Yeah, and we're for net neutrality.
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:03.240]   Any of your other internally?
[00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:10.240]   No, no. I think everybody-- I think that this issue is if anybody's too heavy-handed, the market will correct itself.
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.240]   That's one of the great things about it.
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:14.240]   I don't buy that this is a not paper.
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:19.240]   If you squeezed-- I would not-- if I was one of these telco companies or a cable provider--
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.240]   I agree.
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:21.240]   --wanted John.
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:27.240]   We just want to push Microsoft, Yahoo, and Google because Yahoo and Google could say, "You know what? We've got billions of dollars, too.
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:32.240]   We're going to Wi-Fi all the major cities and we're going to give way for free and we're going to do it just to screw you in."
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:33.240]   That's what I was wondering.
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:35.240]   We're going to do a marketing campaign about the free web.
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:37.240]   And these guys are going to start getting really hit hard.
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:38.240]   It's going to take time.
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:39.240]   So there's going to be distortion.
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:40.240]   This is a good take time.
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.240]   There's always distortion to any free market.
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:43.240]   Oh, wait, that's right.
[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:46.240]   I think Google is much farther along this road than anybody in the world.
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.240]   What do you think of doing?
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:49.240]   Metro Wi-Fi is their poison pill.
[00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.240]   They've got Metro Wi-Fi.
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.240]   That is their poison pill.
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:52.240]   They've got these famous days.
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:53.240]   They are doing it.
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:54.240]   You know what I want to say?
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:56.240]   I'm not going to argue that.
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:57.240]   So what?
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:58.240]   They've been doing this thing right now.
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.240]   Here's the problem.
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:01.240]   Here's what you're overlooking in this.
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:06.240]   When Philadelphia tried to go Wi-Fi, the first thing that happened was Verizon and Comcast, who got together with the government.
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:13.240]   It's okay, but the law that's passed in that started in Pennsylvania because of Philadelphia in his past of 11 states,
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:17.240]   as long as it's not the municipality doing it, anybody can come and do it.
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:21.240]   The fact that they can even get a law like that through means they can get even more onerous law through,
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.240]   and that's what they're going to do.
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:23.240]   That'll keep Google out.
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:27.240]   This is why the net neutrality bit is important.
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:28.240]   Yes.
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:29.240]   No legislation happens.
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:36.240]   So that people are aware of this as an issue, and I think that if the public doesn't get it, they're not going to fight for it.
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.240]   Too complicated.
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:41.240]   It's much easier to screw the citizens of every community in Pennsylvania outside of Philadelphia.
[00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:45.240]   It's much harder to actually screw over somebody like Microsoft or Google.
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:46.240]   They have much better lawyers.
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:51.240]   We have more lawyers than most of the companies that work for.
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:53.240]   [laughter]
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:54.240]   They left it right.
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:57.240]   There were guys who do have all these lawyers because that means one thing after another.
[00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:01.240]   Yeah, but they were pushing it pretty hard for a pretty long extent.
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:06.240]   I got to ask you guys, what do you think of the new Microsoft FlexGo proposal?
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:09.240]   This is basically selling computers like cell phones.
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:15.240]   You get the computer very cheaply, but then you buy minutes, and you have a little card that you scratch off.
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:17.240]   I hate that idea.
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:18.240]   I'm sorry.
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:19.240]   This is your joke, right?
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:20.240]   I'm just not a joke.
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:22.240]   Introducing Microsoft FlexGo.
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:24.240]   Now, you're talking about the onion?
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.240]   No.
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:26.240]   This is an idea.
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.240]   I don't know.
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:28.240]   What?
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:30.240]   We've been talking about this as a great thing.
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.240]   We've been talking about this as a great thing.
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.240]   We've been talking about Microsoft's propaganda tier.
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:36.240]   Would you explain this to us?
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:40.240]   Until now, people in emerging markets have faced two formidable financial barriers to PC ownership.
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:43.240]   The first is the high-entry cost in markets without widely available consumers.
[00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:44.240]   It's not for us.
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.240]   It's for third world, actually.
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:50.240]   The second is the often high-fits monthly loan payments are hard to find at the PC combined with uncertain paychecks a month to month.
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.240]   They're supposed to the MIT $120.
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:53.240]   But they might be able to have one.
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.240]   They held up.
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:56.240]   You know, nobody wants to.
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:57.240]   They held up the stupid...
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:58.240]   That's not going to work.
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:59.240]   I hate to drop.
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:00.240]   I hate to drop.
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:02.240]   I can't even think of it.
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:03.240]   The ultra-portable PC.
[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:04.240]   The U.N. PC.
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:07.240]   This is what's talking about the day because they're not going to be charged.
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:09.240]   And it's like no battery like nobody's in the charge.
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:12.240]   And it's like a ten-time expensive as the brand.
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:15.240]   And when I was over in China, I went with everybody even cell phones.
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.240]   Yeah.
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:18.240]   But they're not using what the emergency market is going on.
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:20.240]   And that's what's one of the fundamental arguments is that...
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:21.240]   Yeah, cell phones and different brands.
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:23.240]   The number one computing platform...
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:26.240]   More than half the world people live on $2 a day.
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:30.240]   That's what the night spent on a Starbucks latte coming over here.
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:33.240]   Hey, Sculpe, you don't have to throw around all your weight over here.
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:36.240]   We know that you're already $6 latte.
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:38.240]   We know you've got all that Microsoft cash.
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.240]   You have to rub it in our face.
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:42.240]   You have to let me near the money machine.
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:47.240]   The survey says iPods are more popular than beer on college campus.
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:49.240]   This is the World of the Mail today from Toronto.
[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:52.240]   Of course, the Canadian headlines you bring out on the beer.
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:55.240]   I'm sorry, with that MIT campus?
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:58.240]   Every other campus on the last city.
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:59.240]   It says every campus.
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:01.240]   It was a survey of 1200 students.
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:07.240]   And it's like the last time anything was more popular than beer was 1997 at when it was the Internet.
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:10.240]   The Internet was more popular than beer.
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:11.240]   I thought more popular than beer.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:14.240]   It worked on only a few hundred people.
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:15.240]   I didn't get it.
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:16.240]   Well, it's like the Nielsen writing.
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:17.240]   You see, it scales.
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.240]   It's mathematics.
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:19.240]   I don't get that.
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.240]   It doesn't work, though.
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.240]   I know.
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:22.240]   I know.
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:24.240]   Here, seven people are deciding what that is.
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:25.240]   Everywhere.
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.240]   I think that has a lot of experience.
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:29.240]   The historians about change.
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:31.240]   The schools can work like that.
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:32.240]   I mean, even like...
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:34.240]   Is there a time for a new student in the audience?
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:36.240]   Presidential polls and everything.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:39.240]   I think the way you have to do this is, on a Friday night, you have to put...
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.240]   Anyone, by the way.
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.240]   Everybody put their iPod out and then have the Kaker beer.
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.240]   Right.
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:44.240]   And then you just see...
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:45.240]   Kaker beer.
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:46.240]   I can't believe it.
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:48.240]   Your name, let's say you're in the audience.
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:49.240]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:50.240]   Yeah, we're not worthy.
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:51.240]   We're not worthy.
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:54.240]   We can't hear it because he's off the mic.
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:56.240]   Dave Weiner is taking pictures of this.
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:31:01.240]   We're here talking about podcasting and blogging and the guy who has invented it.
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:03.240]   He's hanging out in the galleys.
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:04.240]   Give the microphone to Dave.
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:06.240]   Come on over on that side.
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:07.240]   Come around.
[00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:08.240]   Do we have people to do that?
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:10.240]   We have people to do that.
[00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:11.240]   We have partners here.
[00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:12.240]   Wow.
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:13.240]   But we'll get Dave Weiner over here.
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:14.240]   I think that's pretty cool.
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:15.240]   Next story.
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:18.240]   Can somebody drag Dave or drag a microphone over today?
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:20.240]   You have to remind me.
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:21.240]   Next story.
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:25.240]   Windows Genuine Advantage phones home after the Microsoft guy's gone.
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:26.240]   Did you see this story?
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:27.240]   Duh.
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:33.240]   It's not a little concern because this Windows Genuine Advantage every day, apparently, is checking with Microsoft.
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:37.240]   They have fans of making sure you can fly with the license and get to the Windows.
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:38.240]   Keep tabs on the customers.
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.240]   It's just a big deal.
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.240]   No big deal.
[00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:42.240]   They just want to see if you've been stealing software.
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:43.240]   I don't know how.
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:45.240]   It might be interesting to see if you're like it.
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:46.240]   Maybe.
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:47.240]   No big deal.
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:48.240]   The people.
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:49.240]   The people.
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:50.240]   The people.
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.240]   The people.
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:52.240]   The people.
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:53.240]   The people.
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:54.240]   The people.
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:55.240]   The people.
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:56.240]   The people.
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:57.240]   The people.
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:00.240]   I don't want to put them in an awkward position.
[00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:01.240]   Do you think Office 12?
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:02.240]   I have a TV at the point.
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:05.240]   It's very funny to watch Bill Gates.
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:07.240]   He was very combative in the interview.
[00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:09.240]   Well, it was more mellow these days.
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:14.240]   Every time Walt Mossberg or Paris Swiss would ask him a question, he'd go, "Okay.
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.240]   The way you ask the question is wrong.
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:17.240]   Let me rephrase the question."
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:19.240]   He'd rephrase the question for them.
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:21.240]   He's talking to two really brilliant people.
[00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:23.240]   He actually made every question better.
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:24.240]   Well, that's good.
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.240]   That's how brilliant he is.
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:28.240]   He showed off the Office 12.
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.240]   It is very slick.
[00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:30.240]   It's beautiful looking.
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:32.240]   It's actually really easy to use.
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:33.240]   It's really easy to use.
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:34.240]   Now, look at it.
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:35.240]   It looks a lot like OS X.
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:39.240]   It's like starting to look more like smooth and window-y.
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:40.240]   I think we're good.
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:41.240]   I think the time will come.
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:45.240]   And we'll probably later this year when we start getting people saying, "Oh, Vista.
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:47.240]   Oh, what an ugly, how horrible."
[00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:49.240]   Oh, Office, they took out the menus.
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:50.240]   Oh, my God.
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:51.240]   What are we going to do?
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:53.240]   Because anytime there's a big change, remember what happened when XP came out.
[00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:54.240]   Everybody said, "The Fisher Price Enterprise.
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:55.240]   You get used to it."
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:56.240]   That changes different.
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.240]   Dave Weiner, come on.
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:32:58.240]   Have a seat.
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.240]   Dave Weiner is here.
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:00.240]   Thank you, Leo.
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.240]   It's great to have you here.
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:03.240]   Are you here for VloggerCon?
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:04.240]   Yeah, of course.
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:05.240]   I'm a video blogger.
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:06.240]   Didn't you know that?
[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.240]   I didn't know that.
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:08.240]   Yeah.
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:10.240]   Well, I want to be a video blogger.
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:14.240]   And I do actually do your blog, Dan.
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:16.240]   I haven't shut it down yet.
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:17.240]   Okay.
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:19.240]   So you're going to go on the flash of vlogging.
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:20.240]   No, I'm just going to fade away.
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:23.240]   You know, like old soldiers, right?
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.240]   Yeah, you won't be...
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.240]   One day you'll go, "Dave, who's Dave?"
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:28.240]   I don't think that's going to happen.
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:29.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:32.240]   And I doubt very much that if you have anything to do with it, it'll happen either.
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:34.240]   I can't see you going out quietly.
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:35.240]   I will.
[00:33:35.240 --> 00:33:36.240]   Believe me, I will stop, absolutely.
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:39.240]   Is it because you're burnt out on it or is it just the...
[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:40.240]   No.
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:41.240]   No?
[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:42.240]   No, it's time to do something new.
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:43.240]   I got it.
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:50.240]   Like, all the times I've ever done anything new, it's because some catastrophe hit my life and I had to stop doing what I was doing before.
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:52.240]   And I keep waiting for catastrophe.
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:53.240]   It just hasn't happened.
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.240]   Oh, exactly that.
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:55.240]   So I just...
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:57.240]   I should actually stimulate one.
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:59.240]   And it's time I want to do something new.
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:03.240]   I've been doing blogging for a long time and, you know, that's how I'm going to do it.
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:05.240]   I have to say, I think there's like a...
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:07.240]   I think there's something like a...
[00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:10.240]   I don't feel like jumping on the building or anything like that, you know?
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:12.240]   There is definitely a curve to blogging.
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:17.240]   The number one factor we had at WebLogs Inc, the number one challenge we had is a business with Blogger Burnout.
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:22.240]   And somewhere in Year 2, where Year 3 and Skobool speak to this, you just like, "You know what? Everybody shut up.
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:24.240]   I don't want to talk to any of you people anymore.
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:25.240]   I can't stand the conversation."
[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:27.240]   It's just happening with podcasting.
[00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:29.240]   We're kind of almost at that crux.
[00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:30.240]   Everybody gets...
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:31.240]   podcasting is different.
[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:32.240]   How is it different?
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:34.240]   Well, I mean, you don't have comments.
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:35.240]   I think people just get sick and do it.
[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:37.240]   We're all right now.
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:38.240]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:39.240]   Hideous.
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:41.240]   I don't want to be in line of comments.
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:43.240]   Yeah, but they're not here right now.
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:44.240]   Are they?
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:45.240]   Yeah.
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:46.240]   But they believe they don't.
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:49.240]   If they were you right now, it would be a pie or something.
[00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:53.240]   They would be right because I could see them and I could hurt them when they say that.
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:55.240]   That's my rule.
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:35:00.240]   When people write crazy comments, I say, "Listen, write whatever you want, but I have my nephew reads this and my mom reads it."
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:01.240]   So keep it like simple.
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:02.240]   I say the same thing.
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:07.240]   And I say, "Also, if you want a rule of thumb, if you wouldn't say it to my face, then don't say it on my blog."
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:08.240]   Work, Jason.
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:10.240]   And it works all the time.
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:11.240]   And one guy says, "Oh no, I'll say it to you."
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:14.240]   I say, "Great. Here's my schedule. I'm going to be at this conference, this conference, this conference.
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:16.240]   I know you live in the matter. Come say that to my face."
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:17.240]   And the guy didn't say it to my face.
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:18.240]   So I'll have to try this.
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:19.240]   That's the Brooklyn rule.
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:20.240]   It works.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:23.240]   If it works, I would like to do it. I just like the idea here.
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:25.240]   I hope you get this on camera.
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:28.240]   Three of the most important people in blogging right here.
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:29.240]   We've got Scobalding.
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:30.240]   Who's next to Scobalding?
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:33.240]   And you think that's pretty amazing.
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:35.240]   It's the three of you sitting there.
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:36.240]   And I'm really thrilled.
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:38.240]   And there's a bunch of video bloggers here.
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:39.240]   It's not about it.
[00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:41.240]   It's not about it important though.
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:43.240]   That's not what blogging is about.
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:45.240]   It's a mass medium.
[00:35:45.240 --> 00:35:50.240]   And it's not important to be a blogger.
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:51.240]   It's blogging is important.
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:55.240]   And the people who do it are important.
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:57.240]   And what they know and what they have to say.
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:02.240]   That's why it's ridiculous to think of A-list bloggers and gatekeepers.
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:06.240]   If there was ever a gatekeeper in blogging, they would just route around them.
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:07.240]   instantly.
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:14.240]   We bring all of our 20th century values into this and try to figure out how does this rate
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:16.240]   as a 20th century medium.
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:18.240]   But it's not the 20th century anymore.
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:19.240]   Yeah.
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:24.240]   And Leo, that same kind of sentiment also applies to the video blogging world too.
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:29.240]   Where there's a lot more of this sort of, it's different than just like pushing out content
[00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:31.240]   from money and entertainment.
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:32.240]   Yeah.
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.240]   Yeah.
[00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:37.240]   There is a little bit to that.
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:38.240]   I think that.
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:39.240]   But these kids are too young.
[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:41.240]   And they're too young to be an hippie, right?
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:42.240]   Yeah.
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:44.240]   And it was a lot of other things.
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:45.240]   Funny.
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:46.240]   I think it's about being authentic.
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:50.240]   I think that will be the last thing memory of blogging is going to be about authenticity.
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:51.240]   You said that in your blog.
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:52.240]   And I think that's absolutely right.
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:53.240]   Yeah.
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:56.240]   The only thing that really works in blogging is authenticity.
[00:36:56.240 --> 00:36:58.240]   And it carries over to your life.
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:02.240]   I found that when I was doing business before blogging, I was on point.
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:03.240]   I was on message a lot.
[00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:05.240]   And I stuck to the script.
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:08.240]   You needed to when you had a magazine and stuff like that in the old days.
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:10.240]   And now blogging, I just don't care anymore.
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:12.240]   I'm saying, you know what, life is too short.
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:17.240]   I'm going to say what I mean in a field because if you live with that level of honesty and truth,
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:19.240]   I feel like it's in Kumbaya.
[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:24.240]   But I feel like if you live your life like you blog with authenticity, you have a better life.
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:26.240]   You have less to explain your life to me.
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:27.240]   And make it a fly.
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:29.240]   Get to all of them.
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:36.240]   You have to work in the same way.
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:38.240]   The work is not authentic.
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:40.240]   He's authentic for months.
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:43.240]   He probably has like 80,000 people writing for him, right?
[00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:50.240]   He's a good man.
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:51.240]   Really?
[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:52.240]   You write all that stuff yourself?
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:53.240]   Everything you set when it comes to the books.
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:57.240]   And I also have some guys blogging with me, but their names are very clearly on the...
[00:37:57.240 --> 00:37:58.240]   Is that right?
[00:37:58.240 --> 00:38:00.240]   So that's not authentic.
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:04.240]   John de Borac is usually by me unless somebody did it.
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:06.240]   Or one of them just write phones.
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:09.240]   I would submit that John's voice is very authentic.
[00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:15.240]   You may disagree with what he says, but he never sensors based on whether you're going to agree with him or disagree with him.
[00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:18.240]   To me, it's not just about authenticity.
[00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:20.240]   It's about anybody can get access to.
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:21.240]   I agree with that.
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:28.240]   20 years ago, I had to talk at CNN or CBS or MTV into airing what I had to say.
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:30.240]   And now I don't have to do that anymore.
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:34.240]   I just go to a video blog tool, put up my video, and if I don't have any on you, it doesn't matter.
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:35.240]   I put it up.
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:36.240]   Well, that's the point.
[00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:39.240]   If a tree falls in the forest and nobody hears it, does it matter?
[00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:43.240]   So, yeah, okay, you have access, but if nobody reads it, does it matter?
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:46.240]   Oh, what changed in the last 15 years?
[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:47.240]   It matters.
[00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:48.240]   It matters.
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:49.240]   It matters.
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:50.240]   It doesn't matter.
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:53.240]   The father has a blog and not how many people read it.
[00:38:53.240 --> 00:38:56.240]   So, she's writing for herself?
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:57.240]   No, actually not.
[00:38:57.240 --> 00:39:03.240]   Because when she writes her thing about, she's got this thing about buses leaving their engines on when they're parked.
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:09.240]   So, she writes this impassioned essay about that, and somebody else is passionate about it and looks it up at Google.
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:12.240]   And then they find her and they find each other.
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:15.240]   And so, you don't need a billion people reading it.
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:17.240]   You need to write people reading it.
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:18.240]   I've got to be honest.
[00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:19.240]   That really pisses me off, too.
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:20.240]   I'll talk about it later.
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:22.240]   And, you know, this is how it starts.
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:27.240]   I bet you if every single person's panel writes a thing about how pissed off they are about it, somebody will stop.
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:28.240]   Start.
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:32.240]   Turn off your goddamn engine.org, and this will become like a big training thing.
[00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:33.240]   Everybody will hit that blog.
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:34.240]   I got news for you.
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:40.240]   They didn't need to do that, and they now have rules that in her neighborhood, they have to turn the things off.
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:41.240]   No doubt.
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:44.240]   So, she's been effective at doing what she wants to do, you know?
[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:45.240]   Ken Nichols is here.
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:48.240]   Ladies and gentlemen, if anybody has a question for a ninja,
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:49.240]   please.
[00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:51.240]   You're actually a ninja.
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:52.240]   Okay.
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:54.240]   I'm going to just hear.
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:58.240]   If you'd like to rotate some of us old timers out, or...
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:01.240]   I don't know if we can get a knife or something at a time, you know?
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:04.240]   I mean, I'll take him for the ninja guy, okay?
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:05.240]   I'll be all in her.
[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:06.240]   All right.
[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:07.240]   Dave, it's great to see you.
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:09.240]   And on behalf of publiccasters everywhere, thank you.
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.240]   There wouldn't be podcasts for that big one.
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:17.240]   I have to say, you know, like with Dave, like, this is one thing that doesn't come across in blogging sometimes,
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:18.240]   it's tone.
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:21.240]   And like, I hadn't met Dave in person, and Dave blogs with passion.
[00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:23.240]   Sometimes people say, "Oh, Dave's a jerk."
[00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:27.240]   He's notorious for being a, you know, roughly piffethers.
[00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:28.240]   Right.
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:31.240]   But then you go meet the guy in person, and you never think that again.
[00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:34.240]   And then the people who know me are like, "I'm a J-School guy."
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:36.240]   And then the people I never met who blog.
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:37.240]   That bastard.
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:38.240]   Or like that...
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:40.240]   Hey, wait, you're a cocaine is up.
[00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:41.240]   Yeah.
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:42.240]   That's really...
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:43.240]   That's really...
[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:44.240]   It is something that can be lost.
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:46.240]   It's tone and blogging is a problem.
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:47.240]   I will admit that.
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:50.240]   I can't believe that Ninja had to get that there.
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:53.240]   Are you actually the guy in the Ninja's studio?
[00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:55.240]   We were very close with the Ninja.
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:59.240]   So, you know, me and my partner Douglas Saran, you know, where...
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:02.240]   The international order of Ninja chooses you.
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:04.240]   You don't choose them to do a post-life podcast.
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:07.240]   And if people knew you were a Ninja, you'd probably have to kill him.
[00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:08.240]   Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:15.240]   So, you know, like, we're real protective of the Ninja, and we're just grateful he doesn't kill us.
[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:20.240]   He has to ask the Ninja to define vlogging.
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:23.240]   Now, here we go again.
[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:24.240]   Oh boy.
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:26.240]   Le Porte said it again.
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:27.240]   What would the Ninja say?
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:28.240]   Define vlogging.
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:38.240]   I know, it's a real personal me of like Douglas and I, you know, essentially we do the whole thing in my apartment with the Ninja.
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:42.240]   Oh my God, he just jumps through the window and then jumps back out.
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:45.240]   I'm sorry, I said you black macbook.
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:46.240]   What's the name of the Ninja?
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:47.240]   It's a black macbook.
[00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:49.240]   Seriously, 17 years left, please.
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:50.240]   But it's a real...
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:53.240]   It's a kick to us that, you know, 300,000 people every week watch us.
[00:41:53.240 --> 00:42:02.240]   You know, it's a very personal expression where, like, I'll release the episode and I'll know that instantly there's no, like, there's no one above me going, oh, that's not funny or this or that.
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:05.240]   Like, we get that feedback from the... from our audience directly.
[00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:24.240]   And like, that's really amazing and really refreshing and brings kind of almost a theatrical quality back to, you know, film entertainment where, you know, you get direct feedback, you know, instantly where, before if you do television, you know, it's months and if you do films, it's years and with video podcasting, it's just like, you get it out there.
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:39.240]   I've heard that working in traditional TVs, I always think where I work at G4TechTV in Canada, that all the VPs are in one part of our building and they're all making decisions and not talking to you at all. So you have no idea ever what they're thinking or what they're doing, whereas being in podcasting, it's so great because you make all the decisions.
[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:44.240]   Patrick and I found out that television executives actually do watch all the time, but they haven't watched with the sound off.
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:47.240]   So there's no sense of content at all.
[00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:51.240]   Right, well, depending on the point I say, like, why does that girl look terrible? Put more makeup on her.
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:43:05.240]   Somebody told me a story about, like, Anna Mampour, the woman who does like, Christiana, and they said the first thing when she was reporting on the war, that one of the producers said, there's somebody who works there, the first thing that was telling her to get some sleep and put on more eye makeup, she looks terrible.
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:33.240]   I think that's really true. And what it underscores is, it is exact antithesis of what we've been talking about, which is that content and authenticity are important in this medium.
[00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:38.240]   They are not important in mainstream television. It's all about presentation. It's all about how it looks.
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:45.240]   But like, that said, I still think a lot of people want to, there's a lot of debate in the community about it.
[00:43:45.240 --> 00:43:47.240]   Yeah, you're not really about content.
[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:50.240]   But no, but it's pretty good.
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:59.240]   You can't deny that 2,000 years of storytelling, that's been a lesson.
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:07.240]   You know, that's why we have a clear beginning, we have a clear art, and we have a clear end.
[00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:09.240]   Can you have a story arc?
[00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:17.240]   Well, it does. You know when you go to that weird song, and then when you say that, that looks for the next question, I look forward to killing you soon, you know that that's it.
[00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:22.240]   That's very good point. There are some tropes you cannot break.
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:29.240]   Do you find that, Andrew, that there are things that you need to do that make it more television or more video that it just about you?
[00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:33.240]   No, we don't ever think in that perspective.
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:38.240]   But, you know, here's how we're fishing around for definitions and trying to explain it.
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:44.240]   You know what I think the best way to explain video and try to categorize it is in terms of distance.
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:51.240]   That really, it doesn't matter where you distribute it, whether you distribute it over IP, over traditional broadcast, you know, if you want to be able to do it.
[00:44:51.240 --> 00:45:00.240]   You know, if you want to send it over a Y Max tower, but really it's about where it's comfortable to watch, you know, and what platform like.
[00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:13.240]   And that comes with distance. If you're sitting on your couch and the TV is sort of further away, you know, like a 9 foot distance, say, that's where you're going to sit there and watch content that you're going to share with people.
[00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:22.240]   You're going to be relaxed and you're going to consume it. It's not an interactive experience. It's just sort of like a typical TV experience like we have in the content.
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:35.240]   The content is created. The content that we're used to on TV is like that because it's catering to the person that's sitting at that distance from a television set on the couch.
[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:50.240]   Now, as soon as you get content that you're watching on the computer, that distance is only a couple feet. And in that case, when you have that close of a distance, you're in an interactive position typically, at least with a computer, and you're not going to sit there for an hour.
[00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:56.240]   You're not going to share it with your whole family. It's a personal consumption of a shorter thing.
[00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:57.240]   Exactly.
[00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:13.240]   And then now let's move to even a closer than a computer is what, like an iPod or a watch or something, where it's like a 1 foot distance. And in this case, of course, the contents works even better when it's shorter, like a cell phone content, really short and quick.
[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:23.240]   I just thought to you because this is one thing that radio has known for years, and this is the difference in radio and television, which television is more distancing. Radio is very intimate. Audio has always been very intimate.
[00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:29.240]   You listen to it directly into your head, and we do long form in radio all the time. This is a long form show.
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:33.240]   I listen to your show. I get into it with my cue.
[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:34.240]   Thank you.
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:36.240]   Oh, so much over me.
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:46.240]   I see these as a very different kind of experiences in which, well, that's why you have links at the bottom, right? You watch Rocket Boom and the links to what you talk about are there.
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:49.240]   So it's like, it really is like giving a little side-guys-
[00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:55.240]   They take money. No, no, no, those are links that are editorial links. They have links under it of what they look like on the story.
[00:46:55.240 --> 00:47:04.240]   So you start with Rocket Boom, you see Amanda, right? And she's cute, and she's funny, and she's witty, and boom, it's over, and now you go on your adventure.
[00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:06.240]   It's almost like the tour guide.
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:17.240]   Yeah, our intent is to take that information that's out there and compact it into a network where it's like a headline, and then if you're interested, and you want to get even more.
[00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:20.240]   You can be short because you're really giving people richness down the road.
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:28.240]   But I think what I was trying to get at here is that really content is defined mostly by what platform it's created for.
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:34.240]   The furthest distance is the silver screen, and that's a two-hour thing that, you know, what used to...
[00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:35.240]   It really is.
[00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:40.240]   It just reminds me of most is cable access, and I don't mean that in a derogatory way. Cable access was incredibly innovative.
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:42.240]   It was authentic and real.
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:44.240]   And what in New York City?
[00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:47.240]   Well, yeah, New York City was the whole separate part.
[00:47:47.240 --> 00:47:51.240]   But I was putting these channels the other night, and Wayne's World came on.
[00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:55.240]   And I watched the whole thing beginning to end. I said, "This is what it's about.
[00:47:55.240 --> 00:48:08.240]   It's about people doing it with passion authentically, and not for money, and if economics is one of the drivers here, you're not doing it for money, but all of a sudden you guys are making a living, and that is from a lot of people's success."
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:10.240]   And those numbers, they should be making more than a living.
[00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:18.240]   It doesn't need to go. Imagine making a living, for most people, most people aren't at the stage in the career where they become a person out of like you are, or a business person like I am.
[00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:30.240]   These people are at the point at which it's like, "Oh my God, I left my day job that really sucked, and now I work three hours a day doing something I love, and I make more money in my underwear. This is great."
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:32.240]   And that's the bad news.
[00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:42.240]   You're a mainstream media company? You can't compete with the passion of somebody like that. That's why the mainstream media can't compete.
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:47.240]   That's why you guys are number one, and they're number two. On iTunes, right? It's passion.
[00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:50.240]   It's like we're number four, and they're somewhere else.
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:53.240]   Whatever. I think this is just a tiny fraction of our money.
[00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:58.240]   And iTunes is not measuring overall distribution. It's measuring how many people have signed up on that.
[00:48:58.240 --> 00:49:04.240]   Okay, that's why these guys are doing more than MSNBC does at their peak.
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:06.240]   That's exactly right. That's exactly right.
[00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:07.240]   That is mind-blowing.
[00:49:07.240 --> 00:49:13.240]   You know what's weird to me is that MSNBC and these other guys must know this. Do they ever think about it?
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:24.240]   You can be a VP of ABC News, like cited as a direct competitor to it, and it was just like, "You're a billion dollar company."
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:28.240]   You're like the big manager of the people right now.
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:32.240]   That was Bernie, this guy who I know as well.
[00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:37.240]   Everybody in the mainstream media, they are getting it, actually.
[00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:41.240]   And they learn their lessons a lot from the MP3 days when...
[00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:46.240]   But you think the executives are getting it, or is it just the smart kids that have to work in there?
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:49.240]   I think the executives are getting it too, believe me.
[00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:57.240]   That's why Major League Baseball says, "Sling Media is stealing our signal because they're allowing you to make your big baseball another city."
[00:49:57.240 --> 00:50:04.240]   You know the number one consumer of bandwidth, video bandwidth in America is Major League Baseball.
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:07.240]   They blow out more megabytes of video than anybody else in the country.
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:08.240]   Yes.
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:10.240]   Well, I thought we would leave.
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:11.240]   That's what it is.
[00:50:11.240 --> 00:50:12.240]   Okay, that's what it is.
[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:15.240]   For YouTube's, we make it money hands-over-fills.
[00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:22.240]   We have a huge audience per day than the National Hockey League has in America on a regular basis.
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:23.240]   Everybody can't!
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:25.240]   It's so, it's not impressed, okay?
[00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:28.240]   Let me get... I'm a business guy, and let me even be surprised.
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:30.240]   You're never comparing yourself to NHL.
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:32.240]   That thing's on the break-a-door out of business, okay?
[00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:35.240]   And that doesn't mean it's very comprised, NHL's...
[00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:37.240]   Still, I just think of the other services.
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:41.240]   Because the advantage of the hockey games, you know, that that support...
[00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:42.240]   The changing of cars.
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:43.240]   It's amazing.
[00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:46.240]   People have a limited amount of time to spend with media.
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:50.240]   They can consume more now because they have no downtime with the video iPod, whatever.
[00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:54.240]   But there is a limited amount of time, and blogs will be 20% of the media pie.
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:55.240]   It's got to come from somewhere.
[00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:57.240]   Blogs will be 10, 20%.
[00:50:57.240 --> 00:50:58.240]   It's got to come from somewhere.
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:00.240]   Let me tell you something, 10, 20% of people's time?
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:02.240]   That's a hell of a lot of time.
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:08.240]   Which means there's a lot of market, and there's $1.5 billion a year and extra advertising coming into our medium.
[00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:11.240]   That's an addition to what's already come in, you know, 8 or 10 billion a year.
[00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:13.240]   There's not enough inventory for it.
[00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:14.240]   Yeah.
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:15.240]   I mean, the demand...
[00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:17.240]   I mean, we've been hearing from everybody that's been...
[00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:18.240]   Everybody's been inventory.
[00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:19.240]   No.
[00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:21.240]   I'll tell you why they've been inventory.
[00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:22.240]   Why they've been inventory.
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:23.240]   Well, there's bad inventory right now.
[00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:26.240]   Advertises do not want to put their ads on a lot.
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:28.240]   Why they've been inventory?
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:36.240]   No, the traditional inventory, like all of the Turner media and everything that's ever been produced in the history of humanity.
[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:38.240]   It would be so easy to throw online.
[00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:45.240]   It's not time for that yet because people are not sitting at a computer and consuming that kind of data so quickly.
[00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:46.240]   Well, I don't know if it's an NTV.
[00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:57.240]   NTV is the only broadcast company that's been to a traditional company that's had short little, you know, clip type content that's easy to consume on these various platforms.
[00:51:57.240 --> 00:51:59.240]   You'll be working on a major media company within five years.
[00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:00.240]   I guarantee it.
[00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:04.240]   And a major media company will be doing this more than a willing walk for a lot of time.
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:09.240]   You can, if any guarantee would be a collaboration, but we won't be co-opted or sold out.
[00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:10.240]   I can tell you that.
[00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:11.240]   Oh, man.
[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:12.240]   Hey, we're good.
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:13.240]   Did anybody got a drink?
[00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:14.240]   I'm a bad drink.
[00:52:14.240 --> 00:52:16.240]   If I had a nickel.
[00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:30.240]   Hey, no, actually, I've studied how you've created your blog network and I actually use you as an example a lot about a lot of things that we would do differently in terms of how we're not interested in flipping it.
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:35.240]   And we've already been through the venture capital stage and we've passed it and without needing it.
[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:36.240]   So what do you want?
[00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:37.240]   That makes you get even more money.
[00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:38.240]   That's right.
[00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:39.240]   You can be authentic.
[00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:44.240]   There are people who make indie films their whole life for, you know, one or two million dollars and that's fine.
[00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:45.240]   Is that what you want to be?
[00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:46.240]   You both want to make a blockbuster.
[00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:47.240]   It happens.
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:51.240]   But nobody makes blockbusters with an indie budget.
[00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:53.240]   Let's see what's happened there.
[00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:54.240]   I think it is.
[00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:55.240]   And this is what's so exciting.
[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:57.240]   And they're waiting to get on the anomaly.
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:53:04.240]   The thing that's so fascinating is that, say, with your particular business, it required just like almost every single business.
[00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:10.240]   It required venture capital and a venture capital in order to scale it up to a large.
[00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:11.240]   No, even Microsoft.
[00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:16.240]   We didn't have venture capital and we raised a very small amount of money from Mark Cuban and myself.
[00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:17.240]   You've been raised a lot.
[00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:19.240]   We've not raised money for it is a thing.
[00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:20.240]   No, no.
[00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:21.240]   We raised a very small amount.
[00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:22.240]   Let me tell you what I did.
[00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:23.240]   I did it myself.
[00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:25.240]   You didn't raise any, but you raised a small amount.
[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:27.240]   We never used it.
[00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:29.240]   We never actually touched it.
[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:30.240]   It was so profitable.
[00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:31.240]   Interesting.
[00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:33.240]   A small amount of capital that Mark Cuban gave us.
[00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:35.240]   It was under a million dollars.
[00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:38.240]   And the small amount I put in, we never actually cut it.
[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:41.240]   Correct me because Jason isn't old media for crying out loud.
[00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:43.240]   No, it's in case far from old media.
[00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:45.240]   Well, I love the fact that I'm the man now by the way.
[00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:46.240]   You're the man.
[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:47.240]   That's fantastic.
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:48.240]   So with 18 months ago.
[00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:49.240]   Let me tell you something.
[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:50.240]   You don't have to compromise your integrity.
[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:54.240]   We sold the company none of our bloggers have ever been edited to this day.
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:55.240]   And that was part of the deal.
[00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:56.240]   And we sold it.
[00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:57.240]   You could do the same thing with yours.
[00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:58.240]   Well, let me ask you it.
[00:53:58.240 --> 00:53:59.240]   What's your vision?
[00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:00.240]   What do you want?
[00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:07.240]   Well, our thing is that our primary interest at this point is sort of has two stages.
[00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:09.240]   I mean, this is just in our dreams.
[00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:12.240]   Who knows what's going to happen, but this is how we're directing.
[00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:23.240]   And the first stage would look something kind of like what Jason or Nick has done with their blog networks where we have a lot of similar types of niche videos.
[00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:24.240]   And all of that stuff.
[00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:25.240]   That's only just the first stage though.
[00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:44.240]   The second stage really includes a lot of the one thing that we've noticed even though we're really interested in just creating the content in the midst of Rocket Boom and going towards starting to create other content.
[00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:50.240]   There's all of the auxiliary things that we didn't realize that we'd be doing like creating an ad department suddenly.
[00:54:50.240 --> 00:55:00.240]   Like now we could easily just push that off, but by creating it ourselves, we're ingrained in it because as publishers we're publishing the advertisements.
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:01.240]   Same thing with like...
[00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:02.240]   You're not asking my question.
[00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:05.240]   What you want your business structure to be.
[00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:07.240]   What's your vision for your business?
[00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:18.240]   So the vision then as a result of all these auxiliary business opportunities and business support systems that we weren't expecting that we would be getting off into.
[00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:23.240]   We're seeing the whole entire thing looking something like lookout Rupert Murdoch.
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:24.240]   You want a network?
[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:28.240]   I mean, but network has basically like a needle on the floor.
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:29.240]   You know, where you become Rupert Murdoch?
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:31.240]   Get a second hit under your belt.
[00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:33.240]   You're the people that you built.
[00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:34.240]   I love the structures that you built.
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:36.240]   Like our commodity structures.
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:40.240]   It's all about the people that you and the talent that you bring to it.
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:41.240]   Exactly.
[00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:47.240]   We're launching a new video podcast on Sunday with a mainstream television personality behind it because like...
[00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:52.240]   She's frustrated by creating, you know, being on Mad TV and not getting her voice heard.
[00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:59.240]   And so, you know, like it's not about like who can control the video camera or who can edit or all that.
[00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:05.240]   It's just like finding those voices and giving people a media to create with.
[00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:06.240]   Exactly.
[00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:12.240]   And it's everything we were talking about blogging and how blogging is sort of more grassroots and it's more personal.
[00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:15.240]   That sentiment that we were saying you can also apply to life.
[00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:19.240]   You can apply that to business especially in this particular scenario.
[00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:20.240]   And so...
[00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:22.240]   So you want to be Rupert Murdoch with heart?
[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:24.240]   I think that what we can do is...
[00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:27.240]   I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:30.240]   Everybody's going to roll their eyes when you say that.
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:32.240]   Rupert Murdoch, Rupert Murdoch for that.
[00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:33.240]   That's the greatest dream.
[00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:35.240]   I've heard a lot of my rippodores.
[00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:36.240]   No, that's not the answer.
[00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:37.240]   Give us a break.
[00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:40.240]   I mean, let everybody should be able to dream.
[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:41.240]   That's the greatest dream.
[00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:42.240]   That's the greatest opportunity.
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:44.240]   The opportunity is out there right now for people.
[00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:46.240]   It's not like you're not showing signs of success.
[00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:47.240]   I wouldn't worry about it.
[00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:55.240]   One thing you have to remember is, and I remind myself of this a lot, is just because you're first, does it mean that you're going to win?
[00:56:55.240 --> 00:57:00.240]   And so you were the first and so you get a disproportionate amount of audience and attention.
[00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:06.240]   And when I did "Sylvia Reporter" I was 25 years old and I had bright eyes like you did and I got way too much press.
[00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:09.240]   But then the hard work starts and you have to learn how to scale a bit.
[00:57:09.240 --> 00:57:10.240]   I've just said that.
[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:18.240]   If you look into what has been going on, we feel very confident because we've maintained it for so long and we've been able to...
[00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:20.240]   Do you have a second show yet?
[00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:22.240]   Yeah, we actually just launched it yesterday.
[00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:23.240]   What do you call it?
[00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:24.240]   A jet set show.
[00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:25.240]   Cool.
[00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:27.240]   Yeah, I mean, when you get one show.
[00:57:27.240 --> 00:57:28.240]   That's great.
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:29.240]   That's a good idea.
[00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:32.240]   And you've got a couple million people, then it's a business.
[00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:36.240]   Right now, you're like, not at the start.
[00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:37.240]   The other thing too is...
[00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:38.240]   The big difference is that there's no...
[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:40.240]   The monetary value is so great too.
[00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:46.240]   Like where it only cost us $25 to create the episode and now we're making 80,000 a week.
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:47.240]   Great margin, man.
[00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:50.240]   And typically when businesses start and there's no competition, it's great margin.
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:52.240]   I disagree with you on some of this.
[00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:55.240]   So one thing, I don't think you have to be a mega company before it's a business.
[00:57:55.240 --> 00:58:01.240]   You're going to be a technical, extremely profitable small company making millions.
[00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:02.240]   Absolutely.
[00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:04.240]   Home store runner Red vs Blue.
[00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:05.240]   Those are all like...
[00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:06.240]   Absolutely.
[00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:08.240]   I think they want to be a Murdoch.
[00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:10.240]   That's why I was thinking about the Murdoch thing.
[00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:12.240]   I want to be Jason Countdown.
[00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:14.240]   That's why I want to be Jason.
[00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:16.240]   He's got a great dog.
[00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:18.240]   He's about to bark at him.
[00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:19.240]   I'll take it.
[00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:20.240]   I'll take it.
[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:22.240]   I think you'll get there.
[00:58:22.240 --> 00:58:28.240]   The thing is, I lived through the down market when you couldn't get advertising if you had...
[00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:30.240]   But it's a different game.
[00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:32.240]   It's not the next year.
[00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:34.240]   No, it's not going to be the next year.
[00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:36.240]   I get this book done.
[00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:38.240]   So you say you couldn't get advertising?
[00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:40.240]   No, I'm talking about advertising.
[00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:42.240]   Advertising can turn off like that.
[00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:51.240]   You know, like some jerk off, lights off a bomb, the economy, you know, the consumer gets a little less confidence, the housing market.
[00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:53.240]   There's a lot of tenuous stuff.
[00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:55.240]   And is everybody here talking about being the next Rupert Mearna?
[00:58:55.240 --> 00:58:56.240]   You ever give no margins?
[00:58:56.240 --> 00:58:57.240]   You ever have to do it?
[00:58:57.240 --> 00:58:58.240]   You never have to do it.
[00:58:58.240 --> 00:58:59.240]   You never have to do it.
[00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:00.240]   Okay, the advertising.
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:01.240]   So I can really get...
[00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:07.240]   Here's another thing too that is that the moving image is the most powerful medium in the world.
[00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:10.240]   And I mean, it really... you can win wars with it.
[00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:12.240]   You can crash stock markets.
[00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:14.240]   I mean, you can really... you win...
[00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:16.240]   You won the same thing for words, actually.
[00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:17.240]   This one, the...
[00:59:17.240 --> 00:59:18.240]   It's not a...
[00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:19.240]   It's not a...
[00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:20.240]   Five of them for you.
[00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:22.240]   You can't even do the Lenny Repensol of the gig loggers.
[00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:23.240]   It's a very... it's a very...
[00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:24.240]   That's not a...
[00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:29.240]   But that means to bring this back though, you were talking before, you were saying, you know, there's a six inch experience.
[00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:31.240]   Which is a six inch experience.
[00:59:31.240 --> 00:59:33.240]   Right, but it's all... you know, I know a lot of people...
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:40.240]   I mean, how many people are downloading movies off of BitTorrent, watching them on a computer, watching them on a notebook, watching them on an iPod, long format, short format.
[00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:43.240]   It's either going to stick with somebody and they're going to keep coming back to it, or they're not.
[00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:50.240]   Well, we're in a transition time right now where we've got content moving around all over the place, but screens are becoming more ubiquitous.
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:52.240]   Yeah, what's the most transitional or if that's how people want it?
[00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:53.240]   It's how people want it.
[00:59:53.240 --> 00:59:54.240]   Maybe how they want it.
[00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:55.240]   It's changing.
[00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:56.240]   Well, YouTube...
[00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:59.240]   Whether or not it has a business model, they can afford their bandwidth in the next year.
[00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:00.240]   It's very successful.
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:01.240]   It's very successful.
[01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:02.240]   You know what I mean?
[01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:05.240]   If I offered all that software for Frank, I'd have a big long line too.
[01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:06.240]   Yeah.
[01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:08.240]   I'll see how they're going to make that money back.
[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:09.240]   You know what I mean?
[01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:16.240]   The demand for these, like, videos, millions of people are watching these are for the round of time in your email box seven times a day.
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:19.240]   People are going to enjoy it. They're going to enjoy short formats. They're going to enjoy long formats.
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:20.240]   None of that's going away.
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:22.240]   Unless peak oil hits and we're all running around.
[01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:26.240]   All the video formats are going to be available on all platforms.
[01:00:26.240 --> 01:00:31.240]   People watching VPD, I'm watching V for Vendetta on my video iPod right now.
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:34.240]   On every time I get in the free car, I watch another head pallet.
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:35.240]   That's right.
[01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:37.240]   I thought it was a great one.
[01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:38.240]   I thought it was a great one.
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:39.240]   I like the acting.
[01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:44.240]   I'll watch a two-hour thing on my watch if I'm in the right place because I'm in a weird spot.
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:45.240]   You had to watch it.
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:47.240]   Still, but I just mean that...
[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:48.240]   I know it.
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:49.240]   I'm a good one.
[01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:51.240]   I'm a good one.
[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:52.240]   I'm a good one.
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:59.240]   Very, typically, I think, like, the general long-form content is going to be more at that distance.
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:06.240]   It's great to think that, but right now, millions of people are downloading VPDs with daily basis long-format videos.
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:07.240]   You want fun back on anywhere?
[01:01:07.240 --> 01:01:08.240]   It's short-forward.
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:09.240]   You know what?
[01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:10.240]   I'm all different.
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:11.240]   I'm all different.
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:17.240]   Back in '98, '99, from Adam Films and a whole slew of venture-back companies that have 40 and 50 million dollars,
[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:18.240]   and you had nothing.
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:20.240]   You got more audience than they got put together.
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:21.240]   That's right.
[01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:22.240]   So there is some things to what you're saying.
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:25.240]   The video iPod has changed things and broadband has changed things.
[01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:32.240]   However, certain things, you know, the long-form format, the 30-minute, you know, sitcom, those things are in great.
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:33.240]   They're not going to go away.
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:34.240]   No.
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:35.240]   And shorts are not going to wipe those out.
[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:36.240]   Right.
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:37.240]   No, but those will be...
[01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:38.240]   Back in '98, we're going to put a dentist.
[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:39.240]   Exactly.
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:40.240]   I agree.
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:42.240]   In fact, it's going to actually grow all of that content even more.
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:45.240]   It's just that those will mostly be watched.
[01:01:45.240 --> 01:01:47.240]   Like, if you're going to sit down and watch something for an hour.
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:52.240]   You know, at Microsoft, I do these hour-long commercials, basically, and I get tens of thousands of people watching them,
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:54.240]   and all my co-workers are going, "That's too long.
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:55.240]   I can't watch this stuff."
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:02:00.240]   I go, "Yeah, but our best customers care about this stuff to make sure that it's like watching a live stream."
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:03.240]   And there's like 96% retention for the entire thing.
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:04.240]   You know what I mean?
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:05.240]   It's amazing to watch some of that.
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:06.240]   It's amazing to watch some of that.
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:07.240]   But you've done it the amazing half of it.
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:08.240]   We are running out of time.
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:10.240]   I really want to thank everybody for being here.
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:14.240]   We have to fit on the CD because AOL apparently can't figure out how to get it hooked up digitally.
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:15.240]   Yeah.
[01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:16.240]   CD's only hooked so much in that test.
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:17.240]   Oh, really?
[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:18.240]   Yeah, part of it.
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:19.240]   I know what we're helping when we do it.
[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:20.240]   When we do it.
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:22.240]   Right, they say the CD is full of it.
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:24.240]   I think you know, it's too good.
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:26.240]   Well, we'll talk.
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:28.240]   We're going to get everybody Blu-ray, right?
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:31.240]   Or the content management system at AOL.
[01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:35.240]   When they move this over to the AOL radio side, they have to burn it to a CD.
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:37.240]   So we have to fit on a single CD.
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:41.240]   That also, many of our listeners like to keep it down to under 80 minutes.
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:43.240]   So I think we should do that.
[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:45.240]   I really want to thank you all.
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:47.240]   It's been a fascinating conversation.
[01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:49.240]   And I think really we just got started.
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:51.240]   There were so many great voices here and I'd love to do this again.
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:53.240]   Andrew, I really appreciate your time.
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:55.240]   Andrew, very rocketboom.com.
[01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:57.240]   It is a great video.
[01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:58.240]   And what's the new one?
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:02:59.240]   Jet Set Show.
[01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:01.240]   Jet Set Show, is that at Jet Set Show.com?
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:02.240]   Yep.
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:03.240]   That's great.
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:04.240]   It's for kids.
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:05.240]   Tell me a little bit about it.
[01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:12.240]   Well, actually, our correspondent Zaudie, who lives in Los Angeles, she and her fiance
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:14.240]   have mostly put this one together.
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:17.240]   Amanda and I have been fun of executively producing it.
[01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:24.240]   We released the beta and actually everybody is freaking out and saying they don't understand
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:27.240]   how this could be geared towards kids.
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:32.240]   In some regards, that's good because we wanted it to be a really sophisticated kids show.
[01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:33.240]   And Mike, let's look at it.
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:34.240]   We have a lot of work to do.
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:35.240]   We have a lot of work to do.
[01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:40.240]   I think we need more feedback from people to say, "No, no, yes, yes."
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:43.240]   We've been sort of in an isolated world, so it'll be nice to be there.
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:44.240]   Put a link on our page.
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:45.240]   Thank you, Eric.
[01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:48.240]   John C. Groucho, Dvorak, Sorex, Bloggs.
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:56.240]   We'll go back to talking about news next time, but this was a lot of fun.
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:59.240]   Actually, next week we're going to be at Yahoo doing the show.
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:01.240]   I won't be here next week, so I'll see you this year.
[01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:02.240]   I'll see you this year.
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:04.240]   And then everybody are here from Morrell.
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:06.240]   Everyone can be listening to me in two weeks.
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:07.240]   Two weeks.
[01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:12.240]   Amber MacArthur, of course, is very visible on the net at command n.tv.
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:13.240]   Yes, and ambermac.com.
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:19.240]   Ambermac.com, and of course the torrent show which you're filming here in San Francisco for Canadian TV.
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:20.240]   And inside the net.
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:22.240]   And inside the net, which we do on the Twitnet.
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:24.240]   Well, for how time's the video now, that's exciting.
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:26.240]   If we can get the server working.
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:27.240]   I don't know what's going on.
[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:28.240]   There's something going on with that.
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:30.240]   The servers are hard.
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:31.240]   Let's go shopping.
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:34.240]   No one knows better than Patrick Narn about that.
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:39.240]   D-L dot TV.
[01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:42.240]   You put a lot of megabytes.
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:43.240]   Terrified.
[01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:44.240]   It's getting really interesting actually.
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:47.240]   We're going to find out where Andrew's getting his cheap food.
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:49.240]   Actually, we're going to land here.
[01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:50.240]   We're going to talk.
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:53.240]   Jake the Calicannist, it's always great to read your blog.
[01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:56.240]   And now to get you on Twit, I'm thrilled you were here.
[01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:57.240]   I'm thrilled to be on the show.
[01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:58.240]   I've been waiting for a long time.
[01:04:58.240 --> 01:04:59.240]   Well, any time you're always welcome.
[01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:00.240]   You haven't until '58?
[01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:01.240]   '57.
[01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:04.240]   It took us 57 episodes we finally got you on.
[01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:05.240]   It's huge.
[01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:06.240]   And I really appreciate your time.
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:08.240]   Where's the best place to go to read your stuff?
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:09.240]   What's the other Calicannist.com?
[01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:10.240]   It's my personal blog.
[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:11.240]   It's well worth reading.
[01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:12.240]   I read it all the time.
[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:14.240]   C-A-A-L-A-C-A-N-I-N.
[01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:15.240]   You got it.
[01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:17.240]   And Eric Nichols asked a ninja.
[01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:18.240]   I'm sorry, what?
[01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:20.240]   And you killed the player.
[01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:22.240]   He could seriously save some of his clothes.
[01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:23.240]   Wow.
[01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:25.240]   And he could just stop by briefly.
[01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:26.240]   And he was so excited.
[01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:28.240]   Wow, this guy was...
[01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:29.240]   Why do I got a sit next to the ninja?
[01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:30.240]   He could kill me at any moment.
[01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:31.240]   I'm going to flip out.
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:32.240]   I'm going to do it.
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:33.240]   Call me Eric again.
[01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:34.240]   It's the hit.
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:36.240]   The ninja could throw me right off the balcony.
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:37.240]   That was just a bit.
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:39.240]   Did you kill me with that?
[01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:40.240]   She was a brush.
[01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:42.240]   I apologize, but I'm so glad you're here.
[01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:44.240]   We love asking ninja.
[01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:46.240]   Everybody loves asking ninja.
[01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:48.240]   The new ones going up on Sunday.
[01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:50.240]   Hope is emo.com.
[01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:52.240]   It's a funny podcast about a sad girl.
[01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:53.240]   About an emo girl?
[01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:54.240]   The Nemo's a happy girl.
[01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:55.240]   I know it's an emo.
[01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:57.240]   So that should be a lot of fun.
[01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:59.240]   I'll make sure she watches that.
[01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:04.240]   Robert Scobull from the Scobullizer and the Channel 9.
[01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:06.240]   I always want to call it plan 9.
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:10.240]   Plan 9 for my Channel 10 too, which is really cool.
[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:11.240]   Is that going on?
[01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:12.240]   Yeah, really fun.
[01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:13.240]   I'm glad to see you.
[01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:14.240]   I'm glad you could come by.
[01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:15.240]   I really appreciate it.
[01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:20.240]   Thanks to Dave Weiner who is off talking to people and making friends and influencing people for joining us.
[01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:21.240]   He really is the king.
[01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:24.240]   We wouldn't be doing what we're doing without Dave Weiner's hard work.
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:29.240]   We'd be sending out email blasts to tell people the download.
[01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:30.240]   Podcasting.
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:32.240]   We wouldn't have podcasting without them.
[01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:34.240]   We thank you all for listening.
[01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:38.240]   Thanks to AOL Radio for giving us the bandwidth of the show AOL.com/podcasting.
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:42.240]   We'll see you next week from Podcast Academy 3 at Yahoo!
[01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:43.240]   Our Leola Port.
[01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:44.240]   Another Twitch.
[01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:45.240]   Here's your new cam.
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:52.240]   [Music]
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:53.240]   Round 4.
[01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:54.240]   Alright.
[01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:55.240]   I should have paid attention.
[01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:56.240]   I don't know what I'm going to do.
[01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:57.240]   It's too much work.
[01:06:57.240 --> 01:06:58.240]   The problem is, there's no limit.
[01:06:58.240 --> 01:06:59.240]   My server's completely collapsed.
[01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:00.240]   So here's the deal.
[01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:06.240]   I'm just trying to get the thing off, but I have a hell of a time when blue screens like forget it.
[01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:07.240]   I'm killing you.
[01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:14.240]   Round 4.
[01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:19.240]   Round 4.
[01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:20.240]   Here's the Twitter.
