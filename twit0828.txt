[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech.
[00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.720]   Alex Kantruitz is here from the Big Technology Podcast.
[00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.960]   A Nicholas De Leon from Consumer Reports.
[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.400]   And flew all the way in from Vatican City.
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.080]   Father Robert Ballis there in studio the digital Jesuit.
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.360]   Lots to talk about this week.
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.360]   Of course, there's those five new bills in Congress
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.360]   to censor Big Tech.
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.200]   We'll see if they could pass.
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.560]   Alex has an opinion.
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.760]   Might surprise you.
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.120]   Also coming up, we're to take a look at Windows 11.
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.960]   And Father Robert's running it.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.440]   He says it's not that big a change.
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.680]   And would you like to buy the original source
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.000]   code for the World Wide Web?
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.280]   It's an NFT.
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.360]   All that coming up and a whole lot more.
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.440]   Next on Twit.
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.760]   Podcasts you love.

[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.800]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech.
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.240]   The show we cover the week's tech news.
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.200]   And we got a great panel for you.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.560]   We're continuing in our plans to slowly bring people back
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.280]   in studio.
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.760]   And look who showed up.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.680]   Just got off a plane from Rome.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.520]   Father Robert Ballisair, the digital Jesuit, is in-house.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.120]   Robert, it's so nice to see you.
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.400]   It's nice to be seen.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.800]   How long has it been since you were in the studio?
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.960]   At least a year.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.520]   I mean, because I was out of the States all of 2020.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.880]   So yeah, we'd have to go back to probably 2019,
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.640]   maybe around June or so.
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.160]   Man.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.840]   It's been a while.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.440]   It's been a while.
[00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.760]   Man, this pandemic has just been endless.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.320]   But it seems to be sort, at least here.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.680]   I know, not so much in Italy.
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.920]   Yeah, it's gotten really bad down in the south.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.160]   So the south wasn't hit early on.
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.840]   It was mostly the north.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.200]   It was north, right.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.840]   And the north is where they concentrated the vaccination
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.360]   program.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.640]   So now, like Sardinia, is terrible.
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.400]   Don't go down.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.080]   And unfortunately, we're also getting
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.040]   a lot of the younger generation that
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.360]   is tired of the pandemic.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.000]   So--
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.240]   Well, they probably also can't get the vaccine, right?
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.480]   They're doing it by age level.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.240]   So I still can't.
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.080]   At my age, I still can't get it.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.080]   I'd be able to get it probably in August.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.400]   And because they're trying to get everyone with at least one
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.720]   dose, they're spreading it out.
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.440]   So it's a three-month--
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.800]   two and a half to three-month wait between doses.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.960]   Which may also impact the effectiveness.
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.240]   Correct, correct.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.520]   Well, I'm glad you came home.
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.080]   And I presume you got it when you got here.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.400]   I got my Pfizer's on well good.
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.360]   I got my double stamp.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.520]   It's Pfizer 5.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.120]   You got your sequel injection?
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.120]   There are so many good jokes for a whole--
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.720]   A little good one for that second.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.760]   I think Alex-- I think it was Alex who came up with that.
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.080]   Alex Cantor, who is also here from Big Technology--
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.120]   his sub-stack newsletter--
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.760]   longtime tech guy who's become a sovereign writer on his own.
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.000]   It's great to see you.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.520]   Welcome.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.760]   Great to see you, too, Leo.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:47.760]   Thanks for coming back.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.520]   Yeah.
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.360]   How's it going with the big technologies?
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.960]   When did you start it?
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.240]   Started it-- actually, this is a good time to celebrate.
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.320]   It's a year old--
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.520]   Congratulations.
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.200]   --this month.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.800]   So yeah, it's been real fun.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.280]   And it's going well.
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.160]   Just surpassed 10,000 subscribers.
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.880]   Oh, that's great.
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:06.280]   Thank you.
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.640]   Yeah.
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.440]   So people seem to be signing up and sticking around,
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.720]   which is a good sign.
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.120]   And that was definitely an early goal.
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.120]   Hit 10,000, the first 10,000 is the hardest.
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.120]   So we made it over that hill on words and upwards.
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.360]   Very congratulations.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.280]   That is a big number.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.280]   That's a big deal.
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.120]   That means it's sustainable.
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.600]   That's wonderful.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.120]   I hope so.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.640]   Yeah.
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.680]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.240]   Also joining us from a little publication
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.600]   you might have heard of, Consumer Reports.
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.760]   Nicholas De Leon, it's always great to have you.
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.600]   Senior reporter and technology guy at Consumer Reports.
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.120]   Oh, yes.
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.040]   Hey, good to see you.
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.920]   Welcome back.
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:39.720]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.480]   Thank you for having me.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.840]   Yeah.
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.120]   Are you in Upper New York State?
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.200]   I am in the Hudson Valley in New York State.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.720]   Nice.
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.440]   It's about 90 minutes north of New York City.
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.960]   I love it.
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.680]   Consumer Reports is based in Yonkers,
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.600]   which is like 30 minutes north.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.240]   And then I'm another hour north of that.
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.600]   So--
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.840]   I love the Hudson Valley.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.280]   It's so pretty.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.880]   So pretty up there.
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.200]   And it's good to have this particular panel here
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.440]   because we are talking about big tech in a lot of different ways.
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.600]   But so much to talk about.
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.840]   We will talk about you were running Windows 11.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.200]   That's going to be announced later this week.
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.480]   We will talk about that.
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.800]   But I want to talk about what happened last week, which
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.000]   is Congress introduced not one, not two, not three, not four,
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.600]   but five, bills regulating big technology a little less
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.880]   than a week ago.
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.600]   Of course, this is right up your alley.
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.960]   The bills are mostly antitrust.
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.400]   You actually break them all down, which is nice.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.600]   Bill won the American Innovation and Choice Online Act, which
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.720]   is the AIACOA.
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.800]   AIACOA doesn't--
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.120]   There are also sorts of fun acronyms for these.
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.560]   Usually they have good acronyms.
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.000]   That one's not so good.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   The ending platform monopolies-- these
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.120]   were all introduced in the House of Representatives.
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.600]   That's bill 2.3 is augmenting compatibility and competition
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.360]   by enabling service switching act.
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.320]   This is the only one that I really think is a good idea.
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.400]   It's the Interoperability Act essentially
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.600]   saying that data should be portable.
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.760]   The Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act of 2021,
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.200]   this is the one that everybody says will probably become law.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.520]   The Senate even will probably pass this.
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.600]   All it is is another tax.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:30.360]   If you file for a merger, the new higher fees
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.640]   will pay for regulation.
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.360]   That's I think Elizabeth Warren's bill.
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.160]   The Senate has already passed it.
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:37.840]   Already passed it.
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:38.360]   They passed it.
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.440]   They passed it on a clear path.
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.720]   But the rest of them probably not.
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.080]   Bill 5, platform competition and Opportunity Act.
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.560]   So Alex did a great job.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.320]   All five of them in one spot if you want to read them.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.160]   But what is your take on these?
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.560]   Besides the additional fee for mergers,
[00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.480]   does any of them have a chance?
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:04.240]   Well, I've along said that there's very little chance
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.080]   that big tech is going to actually be reined in.
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.680]   And that they won't be broken up.
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.360]   They won't face serious legislation.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.520]   Congress doesn't know what it's doing.
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.400]   The regulators are weak.
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.880]   I am starting to change my tune a little bit.
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.360]   I'm not saying that these will necessarily be passed.
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.760]   But I'm saying there is a better chance
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.400]   of these things being passed into law and signed by Joe Biden
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.280]   than I think we should have anticipated in the past.
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:30.720]   The fact that Lena Khan is running the FTC,
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.440]   which I know we're about to get to.
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.000]   And the fact that these bills have bipartisan support,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.560]   so many exact same bills have been introduced in the House,
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.880]   passed in the Senate, have bipartisan support in the House.
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.280]   And the wild card is Rupert Murdoch,
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.040]   who is no friend to big tech,
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:49.400]   is pushing Republican lawmakers to support these bills.
[00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:53.040]   And you've seen Tucker Carlson go after those who haven't.
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:56.480]   And so that way you can have anti-big tech Democrats
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.920]   coming together with Republicans who already don't like big tech
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.880]   because of the censorship claims.
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.880]   And then you have Rupert Murdoch who doesn't like them
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:06.680]   because of the business realities.
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.000]   Everybody comes together in one big happy family
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.560]   and actually can cause some damage here.
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:15.200]   So the smart money would say that there's not a great chance
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:18.120]   that four of the five outside of the merger money
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:20.280]   will be passed.
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.560]   But I would say if you had to bet on it,
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.560]   there's a much better chance that this stuff will go through
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.760]   now than there was a couple of years ago
[00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.680]   when Senators were asking Mark Zuckerberg
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.320]   how to send email through WhatsApp.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.160]   - Right.
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.560]   And of course, the right has one reason
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:36.880]   they want to regulate big tech,
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:40.080]   primarily stemming from Facebook and Twitter's banning
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.240]   of the President Trump.
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.480]   The left has another reason it's more antitrust
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.160]   because traditionally Republicans are pro big business, right?
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.000]   - Right, yeah.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.040]   And this really doesn't touch on the censorship issue
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.880]   that the right is so concerned about.
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.600]   Three out of the five bills here, I admit,
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:00.080]   when I first read them, it gave me the Can Spam Act vibe
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.560]   where, okay, it sounds good,
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.480]   but they're not gonna really enforce this.
[00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.000]   It's gonna be impossible to actually do anything with it.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   But the fact that they've picked on to head up that office
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.960]   and you could essentially take three out of the five bills
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.720]   from her paper, the one that she published on platforms
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.520]   and commerce that she did for the Columbia Law Review.
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:24.280]   - Nina Con is the new chairman of the FTC youngest ever,
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:26.800]   32 years old and is very well known
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.960]   for her anti big tech writings.
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.240]   - And this is not a coincidence.
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:33.560]   They're essentially giving her the ammunition
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.480]   she needs to go after them.
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.520]   So if she had just taken over, it would have been an uphill battle.
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.200]   If the bills were standalone, it would have been an uphill battle.
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:43.360]   But you have a commissioner who now has laws.
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.640]   - It's all kind of lining up.
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:45.480]   - There you go.
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:51.600]   Alex, you'd call one of them a dumb rocket.
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.440]   (laughing)
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.960]   Not a well guided missile.
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.320]   And in particular, one of the five bills you don't like
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.720]   is the bill that would prevent,
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.000]   which actually on the face of it seems reasonable,
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.640]   prevent companies from acquiring potential competitors
[00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.080]   like Facebook did with Instagram and WhatsApp
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:12.600]   to eliminate competitors in the marketplace.
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.920]   But you say that, and I think you make a good point here,
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.280]   that's gonna hurt innovation
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:19.960]   because one of the reasons people start companies
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.440]   is so that they'll be acquired by a big tech company
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.800]   like Google, Facebook, Amazon or Apple.
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.280]   - Well, it's not so much that the end goal
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.720]   is to get acquired by big tech.
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.240]   I think anyone who starts a company
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.680]   really hopes that they'll IPO
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.840]   and become the next one of these companies.
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:36.640]   But most startups don't succeed.
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.720]   And so you wanna have a safety net there
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.120]   just in case you don't reach IPO level,
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.760]   you don't wanna end up capitulating
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.960]   and getting bought by a small company
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.040]   for a low amount of money
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.080]   or having to fold your operation.
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.920]   And these five big tech companies
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.920]   have made some big acquisitions for companies
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.360]   that aren't ready to go public,
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:57.280]   but do create some real value.
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.280]   And so it's not as much as like what's gonna happen
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.760]   if they stop the acquisitions today.
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:04.000]   It's how does that change the incentives
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.280]   for startup founders?
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.560]   Because I think startup founders are pretty smart.
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.120]   They think about where they're going before they get there.
[00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.880]   And if they see that their predecessors aren't able
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.480]   to have impressive exits, if they can't IPO,
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.960]   they might change their calculation
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.440]   about whether they wanna start their company in the first place.
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:23.440]   And if we do have less companies starting in the country,
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:26.280]   we're gonna end up having, as you mentioned, less innovation.
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.040]   And so I think that's a really big deal.
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:29.720]   - You also make it an excellent point.
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:32.160]   And we have a very good example of that.
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.120]   If companies are prohibited from acquiring other companies,
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.840]   Facebook did get Instagram and WhatsApp,
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.800]   but they wanted Snapchat.
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.000]   And Snapchat said no,
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.480]   then what they'll do is one of two things.
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.840]   They'll either create a competitive clone,
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.880]   which is what Facebook did to Snapchat,
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.480]   and try to put it out of the business that way.
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.080]   You might argue, well, that's good
[00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.600]   because they'll be competition now.
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:59.320]   Or they acquire, they acquire the people from that company.
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.400]   They hire away all the good talent
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:04.400]   and then in effect hollow the company out from the inside.
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:08.600]   Neither of which outcome really is ideal.
[00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.120]   I think it's probably better for Facebook
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:14.640]   to clone Snapchat than it is for them to buy it though.
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.280]   - I think there's a good lens here
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:19.600]   is to look at it through the eyes of Lena Khan.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.960]   Because her thing, and the way she's looking at monopoly
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.240]   is an antitrust, is not just,
[00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.760]   oh, you're big, therefore you're a monopoly.
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.840]   She's looking specifically at platforming.
[00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:33.320]   So if you use your platform to then decrease competition,
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.520]   even if it keeps prices down,
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.080]   she believes that's still anti-competitive.
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:40.040]   So what she's opening the door for is you can be the platform,
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.600]   but you have to be a common carrier.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.200]   You can have acquisitions,
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.680]   but you can't have acquisitions
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.360]   if you also run the platform.
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.440]   I think that's actually a good balance
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:52.160]   because I agree, I think that it can stop innovation
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.040]   if people don't know if they're gonna be able
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:56.160]   to recoup their initial investment
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.560]   because they can't get all the way through with the startup.
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:03.120]   But you can have that without allowing the company to be bought
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.800]   by the dominant platform, by the Amazon, the Microsoft,
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:07.640]   the Apple.
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:10.700]   I'd like to give this a try.
[00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:14.560]   - Well, don't we have, just to push back on this a little bit,
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:17.480]   don't we have regulatory agencies for a reason?
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:20.200]   I mean, we put Lena Khan in charge of the agency
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.040]   that evaluates these mergers and acquisitions.
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:25.720]   And now we're gonna write a law that says the companies
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:28.000]   that she's focused on can't acquire at all.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.080]   Like I thought we had faith in this person
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:32.320]   to actually run an agency in a competent way,
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.240]   which it hasn't been up until this point.
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:37.320]   It doesn't have the resources or the staffing or the ambition.
[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.840]   Now we have Lena Khan in there
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.360]   and we're gonna write a law that's gonna take away
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:45.080]   the agency's ability to evaluate these mergers.
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:48.240]   Do it one by one, do it on a case by case basis.
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.360]   You'd never know what's gonna happen if you write what I,
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:53.600]   you know, I called it a dumb rocket because it's so broad
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:56.080]   that there could be a ton of collateral damage.
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:59.840]   And ultimately, you know, it's Congress saying we wanna,
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.360]   you know, prevent every, we're gonna have these companies
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.720]   around for a long time.
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.480]   We're gonna have companies that meet these definitions
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:09.320]   that Congress put forward in the paper for a long time.
[00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:12.480]   And so I just find it a little bit ridiculous
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:13.840]   to say they can't acquire.
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.960]   I mean, it's just, that's not how a market works.
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:18.000]   It's, I thought these things were supposed to promote
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.120]   competition.
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:22.160]   And at the end of the day, I think this really inhibits it.
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.040]   - Now Alex, I wanna ask about that
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:25.920]   because my understanding was this is,
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.480]   these are more soft touch.
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:31.000]   So the FTC would still be doing that evaluation, right?
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.720]   I mean, they would be the ones who could look
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.240]   at a potential deal and say,
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.560]   no, this runs a follow that law or it doesn't.
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:38.600]   Or does this completely take it away from the FTC?
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.720]   I didn't read that part.
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.700]   - Not, look, it doesn't take it away completely,
[00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:44.160]   but when you look at the law,
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.440]   the prohibition on acquisitions is so broad
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.200]   that it'd be really difficult for these companies
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.400]   to make the case that they should be able to acquire.
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.000]   I mean, basically it says, you know,
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.360]   you can't acquire something that's gonna enhance your service
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.040]   or potentially compete with you.
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.200]   What's left?
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.760]   I mean, I really don't know,
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:02.200]   especially look at the companies, the size that they are
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:05.760]   and the amount of different things that they do.
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:09.640]   So honestly, just, I mean, we have an FTC
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:11.400]   to approve these things for a reason.
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:15.200]   So it's just gonna lead to all these downstream bad effects.
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:18.200]   And I mean, just last thing about the law,
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.840]   it starts not with the exceptions,
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.320]   but with the broad prohibition.
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:24.200]   You can't make acquisitions unless, right?
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:27.040]   As opposed to these are potentially the type of acquisitions
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:29.160]   you can't make leaving the rest open.
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:32.640]   So it's so broad and, you know, I don't know, look,
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:35.120]   I think that we have a package of five bills.
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.840]   As Leo mentioned at the top,
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.440]   some are gonna have some really good ideas.
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:39.520]   I think some have great ideas.
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.880]   I think funding the regulators is extremely smart.
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:45.280]   I've been calling for it for a while in big technology.
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:48.560]   Some of the other ideas talked about are also pretty good,
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.800]   but you're also gonna have some, you know,
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.160]   pretty dumb and bad ideas.
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.000]   And I happen to think this is one.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.320]   I'm welcome disagreement, but I just don't see the need
[00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:58.640]   to do what Congress is outlining in this one.
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:15:59.960]   - That's fair, that's fair.
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:03.600]   - Also, the nature of this is that even if the house passes
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:06.400]   all five, well, all four,
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.480]   'cause the fifth one, if the house passes, it's done.
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.120]   - But there's something in the way.
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.560]   - It has to not only get through the Senate,
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:13.160]   but it also gets through reconciliation,
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.160]   presumably the Senate's gonna have some other opinions
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:16.000]   about this.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.480]   This is how the sausage is made.
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:20.080]   You propose something you negotiate
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.040]   and maybe you come to a better law down the--
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:26.560]   - I see the Senate suddenly wanting to insert language
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:29.840]   along with these bills to address the censorship item.
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.880]   - I think at some point though also,
[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:34.600]   Republicans have to stand up for what they've said
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.800]   all along, which is we believe in business
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.520]   and we believe in less regulation.
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:40.360]   This is not less regulation.
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:42.400]   This is more regulation.
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.280]   This is contrary to what Republicans have said for,
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:48.120]   you know, since 1920.
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:52.160]   - So it is, sorry, it is remarkable how Republicans
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.040]   and Democrats are so in sync on this.
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.160]   I mean, you look at these--
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:57.240]   - For different reasons. - Yes, in sync.
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:01.840]   - I think the 2016 election turned them all against big tech,
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:02.680]   right?
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:06.360]   The Democrats said you did Trump and then they evolved
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:08.360]   that into your anti-competitive
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:11.160]   and the Republicans said your censoring conservative voices
[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.880]   and they said, what authority do we have to take
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:17.040]   on these companies and they evolved that into competition?
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:19.640]   So then you have a hearing where you have Amy Klobuchar
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:22.240]   and Josh Hawley who would never agree with each other
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.760]   on anything. - Like any thing.
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.840]   - Giving each other time and riffing off
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:27.040]   of each other's points.
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.000]   - That's the hell I am, I'm honest with you.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.320]   - Yeah, so I say 2017, 2018, it didn't seem like
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.480]   anything was gonna happen, but you know,
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.720]   the government works in really interesting ways.
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.720]   Once you get something written down on paper,
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.920]   which we have right now, you never know where it's gonna go.
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:46.760]   And so I have given up the never, never gonna happen.
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:48.520]   - Yeah, perspective could happen.
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.160]   - It is unbelievable. - And you watch the way
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.840]   these folks talk and even Joe Biden is on board
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:54.680]   with a lot of this stuff.
[00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:56.680]   - Well, he appointed Tim Wu to his--
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:57.520]   - Point it to Wu.
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:59.360]   - Yeah, I mean, clearly in a kind.
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:04.040]   - The Biden administration is all in on regulating big tech.
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:07.960]   Let's not forget, Europe is also all in on regulating big tech.
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:11.400]   So I could see why Jeff Bezos retired.
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.240]   (laughing)
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:14.440]   - I think the issue is both the Republicans
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:16.920]   and the Democrats agree on regulating big tech,
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:18.960]   but they don't want the other side to take a win
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.120]   for regulating big tech.
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.600]   - Do they really agree on the best ways to do it?
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.320]   - Why, yeah, why and what the best ways are?
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.600]   - You know, our politics has become so much about
[00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:30.200]   punishing your enemies as opposed to supporting your causes.
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.640]   And Leo, when you talk about the Republican support
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:35.040]   for free markets, that's all I thought about was like,
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:37.240]   you know, they're mad enough that maybe this is
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.600]   where they end up going.
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:39.440]   - Yeah.
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.600]   - So Bezos, I mean, I think this past week
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.320]   I did a tweet talking about how, you know,
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:48.560]   once he heard, Lena Kahn was gonna be the FTC commissioner.
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:51.080]   He said, okay, space doesn't really sound so bad.
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.080]   (laughing)
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:55.080]   - Well, you saw the petition that Jeff Bezos
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:57.440]   stay in space once he gets there.
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.720]   I think there's something like 30 or 40,000 signatures.
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:02.280]   I don't know how exactly he would do it, but.
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.880]   - Yeah, he's only gonna be there for three minutes.
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.400]   So I started this point everyone.
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.080]   He's coming back.
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:07.880]   - He's coming back.
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.480]   So is Richard Branson.
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:11.840]   Well, if all goes well anyway.
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:16.120]   Who is gonna be the person who stands up and says,
[00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.880]   yeah, they banned Trump, but you know what?
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:22.680]   What would this pandemic have been like without big tech,
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:24.760]   making it possible for us to go to school,
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:27.040]   for many of us to stay working?
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:29.840]   This pandemic would have been a lot worse without big tech.
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:33.840]   And let's not forget the technology, mRNA,
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:36.200]   that's given us the vaccine.
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:39.240]   It's so easy to make an enemy out of tech,
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:42.080]   but I think there's also, I wanna defend it a little bit
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.880]   because there's a consequence to this.
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.440]   We get a lot of benefits out of this.
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.280]   You know, one of the debates we've been talking about
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:52.760]   over the last few weeks is Amazon's sidewalk,
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:55.600]   which, you know, if it came from anybody, but Amazon,
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:58.440]   people might not have been so negative about it.
[00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:01.160]   It is, I think Amazon's attempt to do something
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:04.280]   for the public good, but because it came out Amazon
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.600]   and because they left, they had it on by default,
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:10.000]   I think people are gonna, it's gonna be a non-starter.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.840]   Have you talked at all, Nicholas, about sidewalk
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:15.600]   and with your consumer reports audience,
[00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:17.880]   and what is your recommendation to them?
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:21.040]   - We have not, or I have not written about sidewalk,
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:23.760]   but I will wanna sort of tag on to what you just said.
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.800]   And I sort of personally agree, you know,
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:29.800]   I've been covering, I mean, technology for 15 years now,
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:32.200]   I grew up reading like Sound Envision Magazine
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.320]   and things like that.
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:35.320]   All this stuff was like always fun
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:37.840]   and exciting and interesting to me.
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:40.480]   So I do understand people's concerns with,
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:43.320]   but like big tech, like I honestly didn't even recognize
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.320]   that that's like, oh, let's like big tobacco.
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.320]   - It is. - I'm like a couple months ago.
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:48.360]   - It is. - And I'm like,
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:51.360]   people really hate these companies that, you know,
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.800]   they've really improved our lives.
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:55.200]   And I get the concerns and I understand, you know,
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.440]   especially with the antitrust stuff
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:00.280]   and consumers having choice in the marketplace,
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:03.040]   but you know, personally, I don't know,
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:07.200]   I like Amazon, I use it all the time.
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:12.280]   A lot of these companies have immeasurably improved my life.
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:14.600]   And, you know, I speak to readers all the time
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:17.120]   and they're, you know, they agree.
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:18.120]   I remember a couple of years ago,
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:21.240]   I was doing a big Facebook story and talking to folks
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:23.560]   like how to use Facebook and to a person.
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:25.600]   They were like, oh, I use it to share, you know,
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:29.520]   baby photos and to, you know, like grandma's, you know,
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:30.400]   funny posts.
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:33.440]   And it's like, I, maybe people are naive,
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:34.680]   maybe people don't see the harm,
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:37.240]   but like for the average person, which is my audience
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.720]   and the kind of, you know, the headspace
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:41.660]   that I kind of live in most of the time nowadays,
[00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:45.400]   this stuff seems maybe not academic,
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:50.400]   but like a very different, very different vibe, I think,
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.080]   to what sort of the average person feels.
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:55.000]   - It's, no, it's the world we live in
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.320]   where you can get people riled up.
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:58.960]   They ban the president on Facebook.
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.280]   At the same time as they go, but I'm gonna use it
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.400]   to say happy Father's Day, I love it.
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:04.240]   - Exactly.
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.580]   - And I think people do actually love Google,
[00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:08.840]   Facebook, Amazon, Apple.
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:10.480]   They do love it.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:11.400]   And they use it.
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:12.640]   Tomorrow is Prime Day,
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:15.160]   for tomorrow and Tuesday, or Prime Days,
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:17.520]   they're gonna have huge amounts of traffic,
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:19.480]   huge amounts of people using Amazon.
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.040]   At the same time as people saying,
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:24.440]   but I don't, which that's part of the sidewalk argument
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:28.000]   that gets me because the people who are turning off sidewalk,
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.440]   the only way you could turn off sidewalk
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:31.360]   is if you have Amazon echoes in your house,
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:32.680]   or ring of doorbells in your house.
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:37.000]   You're already giving Amazon images and sound
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.160]   and everything else, and you're worried about sidewalk?
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:42.160]   I mean, it doesn't make sense to me.
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.920]   - I was with my parents in Las Vegas,
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:45.560]   and they live in a semi-retirement community.
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:46.600]   - It's a little schizophrenic.
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:47.920]   - It's very schizophrenic.
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.080]   They were with groups of friends,
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:50.240]   and they all started talking about
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:51.280]   how much they hated Amazon,
[00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:53.520]   and they would never buy anything from Amazon,
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:55.240]   but they've got ring video doorbells.
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:56.840]   They do pill packs.
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:57.680]   - Pill pack. - Yeah.
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:01.040]   - They've got Amazon echoes in the house,
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:05.320]   so they don't quite understand exactly how much that can be.
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.480]   - Maybe that's part of the problem is that Big Tech
[00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:10.000]   is so pervasive now.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.040]   You cannot escape it.
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:13.120]   We've seen articles years ago, even,
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.240]   from the New York Times was at Kevin Rus
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.640]   who said, or Taylor Lawrence, somebody said,
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.520]   so I'm not gonna use any of the Big Five,
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:22.880]   and she basically couldn't use anything.
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:23.720]   - That was cash-hill.
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:24.560]   - Cash-hill. - Cash-hill.
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:26.600]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:31.120]   - Without Google, every site is hosted by Amazon,
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:33.720]   or Google, we live in Big Tech.
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:34.920]   We're immersed in it.
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:36.520]   It's hard to imagine surgery
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:39.680]   that's gonna leave the patient alive and well.
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:41.200]   - Are we getting to the issue here,
[00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:42.880]   which is that these companies,
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.280]   I think many of us agree,
[00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:46.240]   are a net positive to society.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.080]   - Yes.
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:48.480]   - And I'm gonna steal us from Scott Galloway.
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:49.560]   He said this before.
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:51.440]   The keyword is net, right?
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.760]   So there's also a ton of things that they do
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:57.520]   that are a little bit past the line.
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.720]   And so I don't think even though that they're,
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:01.560]   I appreciate all five of these companies.
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:02.720]   I'm an Amazon Prime member,
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:05.480]   I'm a Facebook daily or weekly active user,
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:06.920]   I use the rest.
[00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:09.320]   But we should still not give up on the fact
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:11.400]   that some of the stuff that they're doing
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:12.760]   is potentially anti-competitive
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:14.600]   and might need to be reined in.
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.760]   And if you look specifically at,
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.880]   I've already talked about my opposition
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:21.000]   to this prohibition of acquisitions.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.680]   But if you look specifically at David C. Selini's bill,
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:26.240]   I don't like the whole thing.
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:27.680]   But the fact that it says,
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:29.880]   if you're a company like Amazon or Google,
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:32.200]   you cannot take data from third parties
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:34.000]   that are using your services
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.400]   and then use that to enhance your services,
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:38.440]   I think that's pretty good.
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:42.000]   Because what you end up having is a number of small
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.280]   and medium-sized businesses,
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:45.120]   whether they're software providers
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:47.720]   or whether they're merchants that are selling on Amazon,
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:50.600]   they end up losing out on potential market opportunity
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:54.480]   because they're forced to go through Amazon or Google
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:57.880]   to reach the people that are gonna end up using their products
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:59.520]   or buying their services.
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:02.640]   And they have this reality where Amazon and Google
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:04.720]   are taking their business secrets the way
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.720]   that they get by nature of the fact
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:08.440]   that they have to work on their platforms
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:10.400]   and using it to make their products great
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:12.200]   and crowd out the competitors.
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:13.720]   And I think if you wanna have a true
[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:15.600]   competitive market economy,
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:18.320]   you can't have that happen because online,
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:20.200]   you really only wanna have one search engine,
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:23.160]   you really only wanna have one e-commerce platform
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:25.600]   because once they become better
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.360]   than all the rest, why use anything else?
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:30.480]   So that's why I think we're seeing a moment where,
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:32.920]   if you take it in the good faith position,
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:34.280]   that's why I think you're seeing a moment
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:36.680]   where we're trying to rein these companies in a little bit
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:41.000]   because their exeses are leading to the fact
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.400]   that others can't grow.
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.280]   So it's not that they're all bad.
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:45.400]   There are some people out there
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:48.120]   who's like these companies can't do anything good,
[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:50.400]   but we should make sure that when we think about the net,
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.400]   we try to decrease as much negative as possible
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.240]   and unlock as much good.
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:59.840]   - Sisselini's strategy, you told Axios this a few months ago
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:03.000]   is to introduce so many bills that Big Tech can't fight it.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.840]   - I wouldn't bet on that.
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:07.200]   You've got a lot of lawyers.
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.080]   - And a lot of lobbyists.
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:10.360]   He said if we're one bill,
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:13.840]   it'd be easy for them to band together and fight it.
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:17.440]   Which bill is Sisselini's, Alex?
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:21.320]   - That's the first one, the one that prohibits self-dealing.
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:22.920]   - Self-dealing.
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:25.440]   - You know, when most people talk about their objections
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.240]   to Big Tech, what they're really talking about
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:30.240]   is an objection to vertical integration,
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.640]   massive vertical integration
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:35.360]   and the commoditization of data, of consumer data.
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:36.920]   We talked about that before,
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:40.720]   before Big Tech was the enemy, it was data privacy.
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:42.200]   The issue hasn't really changed.
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.000]   We've just changed the wrapper.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.400]   It's still about what those companies are doing
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:48.040]   with the data that they're receiving,
[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:50.400]   especially since they tend to own everything
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.800]   from shelf to consumer.
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:55.920]   That's, I mean, Alex has alluded to this.
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:58.280]   That's really tricky to regulate
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:02.000]   because how do you get rid of those ill effects
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.280]   without getting rid of the things that we actually--
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:05.360]   - It's brain surgery and I'm afraid you're gonna,
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:07.080]   the patient's not gonna survive.
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:09.040]   So Sisselini's is a really good example
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:12.320]   'cause that's very much what the EU went against.
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:14.480]   They were fighting Google shopping, remember,
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.120]   over the fact that they would self-deal,
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:16.960]   whether they would promote.
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:20.160]   And it's actually very hard to demonstrate
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.440]   that Google's doing that.
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:22.680]   I've always, if you do a search,
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:25.160]   YouTube's right at the top there of those Google searches.
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:26.880]   - Not for me. - And Google's--
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:28.880]   - Not for you? - No, 'cause I use Bing.
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:31.140]   (laughing)
[00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:36.040]   - I spread my online fingerprint out as much as I can.
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:37.560]   - So you're saying, if you search for something
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:39.160]   I'm Bing, you don't see any YouTube videos?
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:40.280]   - No, that's really interesting.
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:41.840]   - Well, not to like the second page.
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:42.760]   - That's really interesting.
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:45.080]   Google says, well, look, all search is supposed to do
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:47.720]   is give people the results they expect they want.
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:50.000]   And it just turns out if the best result is a YouTube result
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.520]   we're gonna show that. - Right.
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:53.320]   - It's kind of hard to demonstrate
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:57.160]   that they're doing that in their own interest
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:00.320]   as opposed to in the interests of the users.
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.800]   I hate to see, I don't wanna have to use Bing.
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:04.120]   - I like Bing.
[00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:04.960]   Really?
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.960]   - Yeah, they got pretty pictures.
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:09.520]   - No, for me, for me, it actually does--
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:11.280]   I do use Bing desktop. - I like the Bing desktop.
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:13.680]   I do use Bing desktop 'cause I like the pretty pictures
[00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.160]   but I would never use Bing for certain.
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.960]   - For what I search for, it tends to give me
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:19.280]   higher quality returns.
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:20.360]   - You're in the minority.
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:21.520]   - Absolutely. - I am very much
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:22.840]   in the minority. - Yeah.
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:24.080]   In fact, where you live--
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:24.920]   - You've got two.
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:25.760]   - Oh, you use Bing too, yeah. - Well, hopefully,
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:26.600]   I have to use this Bing.
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:27.440]   - All right.
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:29.200]   - It's gonna be a Bing shop.
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.200]   - Wow.
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:32.200]   - I think we get to stick-- - I'm gonna Google all the way.
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.040]   - Yeah. - Google gives you
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:35.360]   the best results. - For people, good.
[00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:38.560]   - That's why when Google emerged 15 years ago,
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:40.520]   they just clobbered everybody else.
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:43.560]   'Cause people said, well, that's exactly the results I wanted.
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:46.120]   I'm out of these to all the way, man.
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:47.040]   Hardcore.
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:50.920]   - It's a nice bumper sticker.
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:51.760]   - Okay.
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:55.120]   All right, well, we'll just,
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.120]   I guess we'll watch these as they make their way
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:59.480]   through Congress.
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:03.360]   It does seem to me that the climate has very much changed
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:06.200]   and there is this urge to regulate
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.640]   and I have to say it chills me a little bit
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:12.240]   because I do enjoy the benefits.
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:14.560]   Like you, Nicholas, I'm a fan.
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:17.040]   I understand we want privacy, et cetera.
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:21.720]   My fear always has been with the really hardcore privacy
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:26.720]   advocates is that they're not gonna merely ensure privacy
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:30.600]   for themselves, they're gonna ensure that I who don't care
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:33.720]   am not gonna be able to buy these things that they don't want.
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:36.040]   In other words, they're gonna end up
[00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:38.160]   block ruining it for us all.
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:41.400]   So I think you should have the right to be private.
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:43.320]   I think you should have the right to,
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:47.000]   but I fear that the end result will be we'll lose a lot
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.560]   of things that are really interesting and valuable
[00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:51.840]   out of technology, including things like Amazon Echo.
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:55.480]   - To me, the shift is incredible.
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:58.520]   Like it was, everyone on the iPhone was announced in 2007.
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:00.360]   Like who cared about technology back?
[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:01.400]   Like nerds did.
[00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:02.240]   - Yeah.
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:03.240]   - Go even further back.
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:05.440]   Like I was reminiscing earlier today,
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:08.680]   I went to J&R, which was a big--
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:09.880]   - J&R, yeah.
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:10.720]   - New York City.
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.680]   - I was there for the first HD broadcast.
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:14.640]   I believe it was 1998, it was like a New York jet scheme.
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:15.640]   - They sold electronic products.
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:17.040]   - Nobody cared about tech then.
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:17.880]   - Yeah.
[00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:20.640]   - And it was really the 2016 election,
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:22.880]   and obviously that happened.
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:26.640]   And, but to me, as someone who's been, you know,
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.640]   moderating this initiative as a fan, you know,
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:30.880]   since a kid and professionally for 15 years,
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:34.200]   the complete shift from like, who cares about, you know, tech
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:39.200]   to public enemy number one is just incredible to me, really.
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.200]   - By the way, J&R is gone.
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:42.040]   - They are, they are.
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:42.880]   - That was V&H.
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:44.360]   It's all about B&H.
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:45.200]   - Yeah.
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:46.040]   - That was a great story.
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:46.880]   - Yeah.
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.960]   - Yeah, I love J&R, I bought a lot of stuff from J&R
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:49.800]   over the years.
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:51.560]   - There still is a division because yes,
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:54.520]   the younger generations are now all about the tech,
[00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:57.160]   but I wouldn't classify most of them as geeks.
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:00.000]   They can use the tech, they don't understand how the tech works.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.640]   They don't understand how to build the tech.
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:03.240]   They don't understand what goes into the tech.
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:05.880]   - Well, neither does Congress, so they're a great company.
[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:08.040]   But we need, that's actually, that's a good point.
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:11.040]   We want real geeks, people who actually know
[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:14.040]   what goes into the tech, what has to happen
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:16.160]   for a result to be returned on your phone.
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:18.280]   - I feel like we're looking at people
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:20.200]   and they're frothing at the mouth.
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:22.440]   They're angry for various reasons,
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:25.680]   but I don't think that that leads to a reasoned outcome.
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:26.520]   - No.
[00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:28.320]   - And I admit there's room for a reasoned outcome.
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:30.760]   We definitely want more privacy, data port,
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:34.760]   ability is a great idea, and really when we need,
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:37.600]   these companies have gotten very powerful.
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:39.560]   But I think to some degree, it's also just because
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:42.120]   they're very successful and they're too rich.
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:44.840]   Jeff Bezos is too rich, we don't like that.
[00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:47.600]   And then some of it's political,
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:51.200]   they have an unproven conservative bias
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.280]   and that kind of thing.
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:55.200]   And I think it's so much frothing at the mouth
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:57.840]   that it's not gonna lead to something,
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:00.720]   it's not gonna be a scalpel, it's gonna be a bludgeon.
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:03.000]   And I don't think that that's a good thing in the long run.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.440]   And I think all you have to do is again,
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:07.400]   look at the pandemic, without technology,
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.440]   would be in the middle ages.
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:13.600]   - And I remember, I was at TechCrunch from 2007 until 2011
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.400]   and I remember, I've wrote about privacy a lot.
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:19.440]   I was early, I read Slap, my idea of like a fun weekend
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:21.280]   was like reading slash dot in high school.
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:22.120]   So that's like--
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:23.120]   - Me too, baby.
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:23.960]   - Yeah.
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:25.040]   - That's like where I'm coming from.
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:25.880]   - Right on.
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:27.160]   - So I was very much like writing about privacy
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:29.440]   like all the time, nobody was reading this article.
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:30.720]   So that was not a thing that like,
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:33.600]   not even the TechCrunch audience cared about.
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:37.080]   But now, it is very salient and very important.
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:41.200]   Obviously, I think people get it now more.
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:45.240]   But yeah, it is when Ted Cruz is like,
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:47.160]   like a tea kettle, like freaking out.
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:50.440]   I'm like, uh oh, this is, I'm glad I like review laptop.
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:54.200]   - And Rupert Murdoch, I mean, this guy has been
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:56.040]   the bane of technology.
[00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:58.320]   Look what he did in Australia.
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:02.240]   He's not acting in anybody's interest, but his own.
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:04.520]   This is all about his business interests.
[00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:07.280]   The journal, the Wall Street Journal hates Google,
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:09.480]   but he doesn't pretend to act in anyone's interest
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:10.320]   but his own.
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:12.080]   - Well, I know, we all know what his motivations are.
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:13.480]   - There's a mythos of--
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:15.440]   - But when he comes marching in with his money
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:18.560]   and his lobbyists and says, "Yeah, Congress,
[00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:21.040]   "we ought to pass that, that should scare people."
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:22.680]   That's not a good thing.
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:25.960]   That's not gonna lead to reasoned legislation.
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.000]   - The cool thing about democracy though,
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.640]   is that we have the bills that have been introduced
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:32.680]   and now we get to have a discussion about them.
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:33.520]   - I agree.
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:34.720]   - So everything is gonna come out.
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:37.560]   This isn't gonna be a five week or a six week process.
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:40.440]   It's gonna be a month long, probably years long process
[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:41.520]   until we get somewhere.
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:42.880]   - Well look. - If we ever get somewhere.
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:43.880]   - Let me ask you. - Let me ask you.
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:44.720]   - Go ahead. - Go ahead.
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:46.160]   - I'll just say one last thing.
[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:47.480]   I want to tell a quick story.
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:50.720]   So back in the day, a long time ago,
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:52.560]   I was an intern for a member of Congress
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:55.080]   who's since went to jail, Anthony Wiener.
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:59.920]   But I did get a chance to go down to DC for a week
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:01.520]   to see what it was like in the office
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:05.280]   and they had members of Congress address the interns
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:07.040]   and just give their perspective
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:11.040]   of what was going on in politics at the time.
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.440]   And I happened to be there for the week
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:14.360]   where Mitch McConnell spoke.
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:17.680]   And McConnell, I think he was citing a previous politician
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:21.600]   but talked about how T. Kettle was a good lead into this.
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:24.760]   The house is like a boiling hot cup of tea.
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:25.600]   - Oh yeah.
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:28.560]   - And the sauce of the coals. - The coals, the cup.
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:29.400]   Right? - Yeah.
[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:31.120]   - So what we just saw, yeah, it's exactly.
[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:34.600]   We saw all that frothy tea come out of the house.
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:37.760]   Now we go to the process where the liquid spills out of the cup,
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:40.160]   it goes into the saucer and then we see what we end up with.
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:42.640]   So I don't think this is gonna be,
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:43.920]   I don't think we're gonna end up seeing
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:45.160]   that the bills that were introduced-
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:46.520]   - No, I agree. - to introduce,
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:48.920]   passed into law with the language
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:51.120]   that they were written in because at the end of the day,
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:52.720]   I think you guys are spot on.
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:55.000]   We're talking about a very productive industry.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.640]   We're talking about five companies
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:58.360]   that are at the engine in some ways,
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:00.360]   or the American economy.
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:02.320]   And I don't think ever before in history,
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:03.960]   have you had a government come out,
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:06.160]   come after a productive industry like this
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:08.960]   with a set of laws that have been introduced
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:11.320]   that would reign them in so dramatically.
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:13.080]   So I do think eventually we're gonna end up getting
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:15.600]   to a place where these laws make sense.
[00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:17.680]   - I think that's the history of antitrust laws,
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:20.440]   is the Congress coming off against big oil
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:23.720]   and then big steel and breaking up the trusts.
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:25.040]   That's what antitrust meant.
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:30.040]   And so I guess to some degree, this is a analogous,
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:31.720]   to breaking up big oil.
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:33.720]   - Well, they broke up mobbed hell.
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:36.200]   They won a case against Microsoft,
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:38.360]   but those kind of went to the wayside.
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:42.120]   - And Microsoft stuff left some damage.
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:42.960]   - Yeah.
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:45.120]   - It makes me very nervous,
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:47.080]   mostly because I don't think it's being lobbied.
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:49.000]   The people who are in favor of this,
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.800]   in many cases are in favor of the wrong reasons.
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:53.840]   It's not really what they're talking about.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:56.880]   And then, and then, and this was the question
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:59.680]   I was gonna ask you, Alex, 'cause you have a newsletter.
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:04.680]   Companies like Apple jumping on this privacy bandwagon,
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:06.680]   in fact, Google's jumping on it too,
[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:09.360]   to some degree, which is kind of interesting,
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:10.760]   because it's good for business,
[00:36:10.760 --> 00:36:15.360]   not because they really care about people's privacy.
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:19.320]   And I think what Google and Apple,
[00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.680]   and you watch this 'cause Facebook's gonna eventually
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:24.240]   come along and realize this good publicity
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:26.760]   to say your pro privacy,
[00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:28.880]   all three companies have first party data
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:30.480]   that is second to none.
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:32.040]   So they're not sacrificing anything
[00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:33.640]   from their own point of view.
[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:37.040]   But Apple, for instance, has introduced now,
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:41.240]   in Apple Mail, the ability to turn off
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:44.360]   hidden pixels for trackers,
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:47.880]   which is gonna affect you, I think, in your newsletter.
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:54.240]   They also, and I feel like turning off the ID for advertisers,
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:58.520]   they didn't turn off, but surfacing that.
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:02.280]   Yeah, I think it's pandering a little bit to people saying,
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:04.440]   knowing that people are kind of without thinking,
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:06.880]   gonna say, "Well, I don't want any advertising tracking me,"
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:09.640]   without really thinking about the consequences of this,
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:11.320]   is pandering to people who say,
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:14.440]   "I want everything for free, and I'm not a willing,
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:18.600]   "in any way, to support an ecosystem that pays for it,"
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:20.960]   is not really good business in the long run.
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:22.760]   It's good for Apple, but it's not good business
[00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:23.920]   in the long run.
[00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:27.400]   So, I bothers me a lot that companies like Apple
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:29.000]   are making hay on this,
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.320]   because it's good for their business.
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:31.520]   It's window dressing.
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:33.520]   I think it's window dressing, I really do.
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:35.880]   Alex, you've said that you're not too worried.
[00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:38.960]   I know Casey Newton quoted you in his platformer newsletter.
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:42.000]   You're not too worried about what losing those tracking
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.800]   pixels gonna do to your newsletter.
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:47.560]   Correct, and by the way, I just wanna lead in by saying,
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:50.520]   I agree with you 100% like you noticed when Apple started
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:53.920]   to use privacy as like a core part of its marketing.
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:56.600]   It's when people started to buy iPhones less often,
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:59.640]   because it used to be that you wanna upgrade every year or two,
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:03.520]   or the iPhone was so much better than any Android,
[00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:06.160]   so you would stick with the iPhone.
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:07.880]   Then when that started to dissipate a little bit
[00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:10.640]   and they started to face some real competition,
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:14.440]   and they had a slower upgrade cycle.
[00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:17.320]   Now, all of a sudden, they're using privacy as a marketing tool
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:19.600]   to try to make sure that you stay within their ecosystem.
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:21.600]   You don't switch and you buy new phones.
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:24.000]   And I think that's a little bit ridiculous.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.560]   Although it's up to, it's their prerogative, I think.
[00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:29.000]   It's good business, but it might be a little cynical.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:29.840]   You know?
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:31.480]   It's just tell us, yeah, it's 100% cynical.
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:32.840]   They should tell us what they're up to.
[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:34.600]   It's also, it's hilarious if you look at the history of it,
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:36.360]   because remember, Apple wanted a piece
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:37.360]   of that data collection.
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:40.720]   They wanted to be the cloud service, they didn't get it.
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:43.600]   They'd never created a description that attracted people.
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:45.320]   And so when they realized they couldn't get it,
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:47.080]   they said, well, we could hurt everyone
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:48.560]   who is gathering data.
[00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:49.400]   Right.
[00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:50.160]   And they make horrible.
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:51.800]   How many billions a year from Google
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:54.400]   on the default search, maybe six, eight billion.
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:55.240]   Right.
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:57.560]   But clearly, they don't have, you know,
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:59.320]   that mesh reservations against Google.
[00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:01.640]   Otherwise, they wouldn't make this deal.
[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:04.480]   So, but in terms of my newsletter and the pixel blocking,
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:05.800]   I'm totally OK with it.
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:08.520]   First of all, I'm not 100% sure how many people actually
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:10.920]   are opening the newsletter in Apple Mail.
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:13.240]   I mean, I don't have that data, but generally, like,
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:16.160]   I don't know, I have an iPhone, but I use Gmail app on my phone.
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:16.640]   So.
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:17.640]   Market share--
[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:18.160]   It's actually--
[00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:21.720]   Casey quotes this, "The most recent market share numbers
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:28.680]   from litmus from May 2021, 93.5% of all email opens on phone
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:31.720]   coming Apple Mail on iPhones or iPads.
[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:33.920]   On desktop, Apple Mail is--
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:35.440]   Yeah, with an Android.
[00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:36.800]   I mean, Android is more--
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:38.640]   75% of the market, I'll get 93.
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:41.480]   Yeah, but apparently Android users don't read--
[00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:43.680]   either don't read newsletters on their phone.
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:45.400]   Oh, I don't believe that.
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:46.760]   I don't believe that.
[00:39:46.760 --> 00:39:50.640]   93 and 1/2% on Apple Mail on iPhones or iPads.
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:54.440]   On the desktop, Apple has 58.4%.
[00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:56.040]   So it's a big majority.
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:57.000]   It's a large number.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.120]   So regardless of how much it makes up,
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:01.320]   I happen to think that those numbers are off
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:03.880]   by a large margin, but that's another story.
[00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:04.640]   Ultimately--
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:06.240]   They can be better tracking if they're
[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:07.640]   going to really get those numbers.
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:10.080]   Come on, guys.
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:10.800]   It's funny.
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:12.480]   No tracking on Apple, but it just
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:15.360]   so happens to be that all the tracking says Apple is the leader.
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:16.840]   Anyway, that's the story for another time.
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:19.440]   But I will say that, like, if you are a newsletter that
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:23.000]   sends on volume, you don't really know your readers,
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.680]   they won't answer user survey, then you're in trouble.
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:28.600]   If you're a newsletter that is focused on building
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:33.120]   a relationship with an audience, they'll answer user surveys.
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:34.640]   Like, I know your audience does Leo.
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:35.600]   That's what we do.
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:36.360]   My audience--
[00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:38.520]   Podcasts don't have the luxury of pixel tracking.
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:40.120]   Oh, yeah, exactly.
[00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:41.880]   And I use Substack.
[00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:44.320]   Substack is, again, it's a subscription platform.
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:48.040]   I happen to have a free newsletter that I monetize with ads.
[00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:49.840]   So Substack won't deliver--
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:52.760]   But don't your advertisers want to know how many people
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:53.480]   saw their ads?
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:56.440]   I mean, isn't that how you bill or no?
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:41:00.400]   Well, look, we do show them what the opens are.
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:01.440]   Yeah, so you're going to lose that.
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:02.960]   You're not going to know.
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:05.000]   Actually, so I have a few things to say about that.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.280]   So first of all, I think the list size matters a lot more.
[00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:09.400]   The number of subscribers.
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:10.680]   The total number of opens.
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:12.480]   I mean, if you're not going to be like--
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:16.160]   you don't say I'm looking for a newsletter that has 6,000
[00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:16.720]   opens.
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:17.880]   Maybe that should be the way.
[00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:20.000]   Your advertisers like you, Alex.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:20.920]   That's the difference.
[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:22.920]   And they say, oh, he's got 10,000 subscribers.
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:24.440]   They know it's a good placement.
[00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:27.160]   But I tell you what, our advertisers say to me all the time
[00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:28.960]   is, well, how do you know they listened?
[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:30.560]   Because we know how many people download.
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:32.200]   But how do you know they listened?
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:32.560]   Right?
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:33.560]   They want to know that.
[00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:34.080]   Yeah.
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:36.240]   So here's the other thing I think is interesting.
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:39.280]   So oftentimes, we'll have the majority of the views
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:41.440]   of the newsletter come via web.
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:44.240]   Because the people who subscribe to the newsletters,
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:45.920]   they're the evangelists of the newsletter.
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:48.680]   The people who are in this tight in a community that we have
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:50.360]   called Big Technology.
[00:41:50.360 --> 00:41:52.040]   And so they'll open every week.
[00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:54.400]   And then what happens is they'll share it.
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:57.400]   And it will end up on news aggregator websites
[00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:00.320]   like Hacker News or Tech meme or wherever it may be.
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:03.160]   And so oftentimes, we'll have a view count that doubles
[00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:06.720]   or does more than the actual number of subscribers
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:09.440]   because we have that dedicated of a subscriber list.
[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:11.760]   But notice, you count the number of people that
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:13.640]   open the web page.
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:15.240]   You want that information.
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:15.720]   Sure.
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:16.280]   Yeah.
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:18.280]   I mean, so I don't think that it's going to be--
[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:20.200]   what I'm trying to say is I don't think it's
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:21.600]   going to be the end of metrics.
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:24.480]   I don't think that there are people that are coming to the newsletter
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:30.120]   because they want to hit a large, untargeted group of people.
[00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:33.920]   They know they're going to end up hitting a premium audience
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:35.200]   with Big Technology.
[00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:37.840]   They know they're going to end up hitting a good number of people.
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:39.000]   And that's what does it for them.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:39.520]   Yeah.
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:42.880]   I mean, that's probably why our advertisers stay with us.
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:45.200]   But when we build them, we build them
[00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:46.480]   on the number of impressions.
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:50.480]   I mean, that's what the cost of an ad on most media
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:52.800]   is based on the number of people who see it.
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:53.960]   And there's also a car--
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:55.960]   There's a rare that you'll have an advertiser that says,
[00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:57.640]   I don't care how many people see the ad.
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:59.880]   I just want to support you.
[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:03.880]   There are proxies that you can use also in terms
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:05.560]   of the way that people engage with the ad.
[00:43:05.560 --> 00:43:08.920]   Now, we don't go out pitching Big Technology as a performance
[00:43:08.920 --> 00:43:09.440]   newsletter.
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:12.320]   Like, we don't do any CTA deals.
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:17.680]   But we definitely include some sort of URL where we can see how
[00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:21.080]   many people are engaging with the advertiser's direct response.
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:22.080]   Yeah.
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:25.280]   Is it going to hurt me more or is it going to hurt
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:28.080]   like a junk email that goes to, I don't know,
[00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:32.040]   a couple million people whose emails they bought from some list?
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:34.760]   I think those are the people that might get slammed by this.
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:37.720]   But if you're collateral damage, I'm not going to be happy about it.
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:40.640]   Well, I think it will likely drive advertisers
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:42.960]   to say, what were we doing in the first place?
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:46.640]   And what are the environments where we can get next to good context
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:47.960]   as opposed to volume?
[00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:49.560]   And that's where I think we'll end up.
[00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:51.520]   But yeah, I saw the update.
[00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:55.680]   And I didn't try to sell the business immediately, I think.
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:56.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:58.360]   No, and I think you're right not to.
[00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:00.520]   But I think advertisers are crack addicts,
[00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:04.400]   and the crack they're addicted to is met as audience information.
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:04.920]   OK.
[00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:06.480]   And maybe this pushes--
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:08.920]   this is sort of what I said in Casey's newsletter.
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:11.280]   I do agree that there's been an unfortunate addiction
[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:14.240]   to performance metrics in the advertising industry.
[00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:15.040]   And it's impossible.
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:19.760]   It's important to report some of how you perform.
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:22.440]   But ultimately, advertising is best when
[00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:26.200]   it's done in context with a good message next to a good brand.
[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:26.680]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:28.400]   That's the stuff that actually works.
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:31.560]   And so maybe this does drive them toward doing more of that,
[00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:34.800]   in which case, Leo, I think your business is in even better shape.
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:35.760]   And I hope mine is too.
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:39.880]   We're moving more toward the Consumer Reports model
[00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:43.160]   that we are towards the advertising-based model,
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:45.520]   because that's why we started Club Twit.
[00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:50.080]   I wish when we first started Twit, Consumer Reports was my model.
[00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:51.680]   They don't take advertising.
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:53.320]   And they buy all the products they review.
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:55.240]   And I would have loved to have done that.
[00:44:55.240 --> 00:44:56.520]   It just didn't turn out to be--
[00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:57.520]   You bought most of the products.
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:44:58.560]   I try to buy everything.
[00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:02.360]   But other hosts need to get loaners.
[00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:05.480]   And frankly, we tried to do it without advertising.
[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:07.320]   There wasn't enough support.
[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:12.680]   I'm hoping Club Twit, which is our way of trying to monetize
[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:15.400]   and offer people ad-free content, which incidentally,
[00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:19.120]   as a result, as tracker-free succeeds.
[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:22.000]   But I think, honestly, people don't want ads,
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.520]   and they don't want to pay for it.
[00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:25.720]   They basically want everything for free.
[00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:29.320]   And this is, in a way, pandering to an audience that says,
[00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:32.000]   look, I want 100% people like you, Robert.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.240]   I want 100% privacy.
[00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:34.480]   I'm going to fuzz everything.
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:36.520]   Nobody's going to know everything about me.
[00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:38.160]   And I want it all for free.
[00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:42.600]   Except, I am also a conscious consumer of content.
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:45.000]   You probably spend money on stuff you care about.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:45.720]   Stuff I care about.
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:48.680]   Also, if it's a network that I frequent,
[00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:51.320]   I will turn off all my fuzzing and all my blockers.
[00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:52.880]   I actually want to support that.
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:54.160]   Do you think that's universal?
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:55.400]   I don't think so.
[00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:56.400]   No, I wish it was.
[00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:57.680]   It should be that.
[00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:59.840]   If it's a drive-by, you saw them once.
[00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:00.400]   That's fine.
[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:02.760]   If you keep coming back to the same source,
[00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:05.560]   I feel like, well, I want to participate.
[00:46:05.560 --> 00:46:06.680]   I want you to keep going.
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:08.480]   I want you to give me this content.
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:12.080]   So why wouldn't I throw a little bit of my personal information
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:14.160]   out there to keep them going?
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:16.920]   I'm totally sympathetic to people who want their privacy,
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:19.000]   want their data to kept themselves.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.320]   I completely understand that motivation.
[00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:28.360]   I just worry that in that world, all it's going to do
[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:31.040]   is make Rupert Murdoch richer.
[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:38.080]   And it's not going to support people like Alex, who want to go
[00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:41.520]   their own way and do their own thing and give great reporting.
[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:44.360]   I spend $40 a year on the information,
[00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:45.800]   but there's only a handful of things
[00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:47.640]   I'm going to spend that kind of money for,
[00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:50.760]   which means the big guys are going to get richer.
[00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:53.840]   And I also spend money on the Wall Street Journal
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:54.720]   in the New York Times.
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:56.560]   Those guys are going to make more money,
[00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:58.720]   and they're going to be fewer and fewer of the little guys,
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:00.800]   because there's no way to monetize.
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:02.440]   This is what happened with blogging.
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:04.760]   It's what's happening with podcasting.
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:07.440]   There's either the institutional podcasters,
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:10.160]   or there's the hobbyists, and there's no in between.
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:11.600]   There's no middle class.
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:14.120]   And I worry that we're eliminating the middle class
[00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:17.480]   in all of this stuff, that it's going to be big publications
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:19.640]   that can monetize where people who don't care,
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:22.240]   they're just doing it for fun, and there's nothing in between.
[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:23.960]   And that's what happened with blogs.
[00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:27.480]   It's the verge or some guy on the corner going,
[00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:30.880]   "Let me tell you about my e-max setup."
[00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:32.640]   There's nothing in between.
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:36.400]   Yes, but smart marketers will always find a way
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:40.200]   to leverage these asymmetries and end up putting themselves
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:42.760]   in positions that the rest of the market
[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:44.120]   might have given up on.
[00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:46.880]   And I used to work in advertising for a little bit,
[00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:49.240]   and I can tell you that advertisers,
[00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:51.600]   they're smart, they know how to get the job done.
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:53.480]   You worked at adage, right?
[00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:55.480]   I worked at adage, and then my first job was
[00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:59.240]   as an in-house ad buyer for New York City's economic development
[00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:00.240]   coverage. Interesting.
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:02.160]   So you've been on both sides of this equation.
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:04.280]   How long? I made actually the reverse trip.
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:06.920]   Usually people, starters, reporters go into marketing.
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:08.280]   I did marketing and sales.
[00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:10.880]   I sold ad tech for a year and then went into reporting.
[00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:12.880]   How long ago was that?
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:17.800]   2010. So 10 years ago, things were a little different.
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:18.840]   No doubt. Yeah.
[00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:21.440]   I mean, it's really gone crazy now.
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:23.880]   How's it going crazy?
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:25.880]   Ad tech? Yeah.
[00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:28.880]   Well, ad tech, I've definitely reported on it.
[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:29.880]   Take it again.
[00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:31.880]   You should share in your own words.
[00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:33.880]   I think it would be good to hear you.
[00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:35.880]   Well, I think it's...
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:37.880]   First of all, there is a debate whether advertisers benefit
[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:39.880]   from all that ad tech, whether it actually helps them
[00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:42.880]   reach the audience they want, whether it makes the ads more
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:45.880]   successful, and I've seen a lot of evidence that it doesn't.
[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:46.880]   But it doesn't matter.
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:47.880]   It's what I've been trying to say.
[00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:48.880]   Yeah.
[00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:49.880]   We know I agree with you.
[00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:50.880]   I agree with you.
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:51.880]   I think you're right.
[00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:52.880]   I think you're right.
[00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:53.880]   I think that's where they're right.
[00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:55.880]   The question is whether advertisers buy it.
[00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:57.880]   I don't think they do.
[00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:02.880]   And I think that what's going to happen in my business is that
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:06.880]   Spotify is going to completely dominate because they have
[00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:08.880]   first party info.
[00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:12.880]   And if that's why they can give Joe Rogan a hundred million
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:16.880]   dollars is because Joe Rogan will be exclusive on Spotify,
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:18.880]   which means you'll have to listen on the app and they will be
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:21.880]   able to tell advertisers not just when you listen and how
[00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:24.880]   much you listen, but who you are and what your credit card
[00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:26.880]   number is and where you live and all that stuff.
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:29.880]   So first, first party information, the kind of information
[00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:34.880]   Facebook and Google and Apple and Spotify have is now going to
[00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:37.880]   be completely dominant in the industry.
[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:42.880]   And I think that that's very bad, at least in journalism,
[00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:44.880]   that's very bad because you're not going to get the diversity
[00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:46.880]   of voices that you used to have.
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:51.880]   So I think ad tech is the bailful influence.
[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:53.880]   It ruined blogging.
[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:55.880]   It's about to ruin podcasting.
[00:49:55.880 --> 00:50:01.880]   That's just my opinion, but I feel like that's a bad trend.
[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:04.880]   And I understand where it's coming from is people's desire not
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:05.880]   to be tracked.
[00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:11.880]   And I use all the ad blocking, ad tracking technologies too.
[00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:13.880]   So I'm just as guilty as anybody.
[00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:16.880]   The Brave browser, everything is blocked out.
[00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:17.880]   Yeah.
[00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:18.880]   Yeah.
[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:19.880]   Firefox blocks everything.
[00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:21.880]   I've got a pie hole serving my DNS so it actually blocks
[00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:23.880]   how the entire domain shows are about ads.
[00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:26.880]   I mean, we're as good and as bad about this as anybody.
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:28.880]   So I don't know what.
[00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:30.880]   As broadcasters, you think we wouldn't do that.
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:32.880]   But most of the time I do want to block that out.
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:36.880]   So I use next DNS, which is basically a pie hole service.
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:40.880]   And I have it on my home router, but I have to
[00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:46.880]   waitlessly say out of it or because she says, no, I don't see any ads.
[00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:47.880]   What's going on?
[00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:48.880]   I said, no, no, I'm sorry.
[00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:51.880]   She wants to see ads because she says, and you should too.
[00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:54.880]   We're in the ad business, Leo.
[00:50:54.880 --> 00:50:59.880]   Yes, but I don't want to.
[00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:02.880]   Well, that's in a nutshell, a problem here.
[00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:03.880]   Right?
[00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:04.880]   The whole problem.
[00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:05.880]   You know what?
[00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:06.880]   I think Alex, you're an optimist.
[00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:09.880]   You clearly feel like we'll work this out.
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:12.880]   And I think that's the right attitude because we don't have any choice.
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:17.880]   This is Corey Doctorow said this is the largest consumer boycott of all time, the consumer
[00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:20.880]   boycotts against online advertising.
[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:23.880]   And it's working and the companies are getting the message.
[00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:25.880]   And I think it's done.
[00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:27.880]   It's just done.
[00:51:27.880 --> 00:51:30.880]   And so whatever is going to happen, we'll have to work away.
[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:35.880]   I still can't get out of my mind the image of someone complaining that they can't see ads.
[00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:40.880]   I'll sort of make that, it's like I don't block every website I use.
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:45.880]   I use a U block origin every now and then, but I generally kind of let, you know, because
[00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:50.880]   I work in the industry, even if CR is not ad supported, my colleagues work at ad supported
[00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:51.880]   websites.
[00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:55.880]   So I generally try to leave ads, ad blocking off, but like the ads I get in YouTube, I
[00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:57.880]   watch an incredible amount of YouTube.
[00:51:57.880 --> 00:52:01.880]   And the ads that I get are just irrelevant nonsense.
[00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:03.880]   I'll say politely.
[00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:06.880]   Like my views are like very narrow.
[00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:07.880]   Like I like video game stuff.
[00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:11.880]   I like soccer, I like home theater equipment, really nerdy topics.
[00:52:11.880 --> 00:52:14.880]   Can you give me your zip code and.
[00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:19.880]   But like if I have to see like another commercial for like Corona, like beer or like.
[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:24.880]   I'm never, you could pay me and I would, I would not buy that.
[00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:29.880]   But honestly, that's why I pay for YouTube premium because I don't, YouTube has got so,
[00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:33.880]   I think honestly what Google's doing with YouTube is giving is intentionally inflicting
[00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:36.880]   intense pain on you to get you to pay for YouTube.
[00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:38.880]   It feels, it is very painful.
[00:52:38.880 --> 00:52:39.880]   It's awful.
[00:52:39.880 --> 00:52:41.880]   There are no ads if you use braids.
[00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:47.880]   Not to keep talking about the newsletter thing, but I'll say can't block ads in the newsletter.
[00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:48.880]   Yes.
[00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:52.880]   All of our ads are relevant, targeted to the right people and we don't use any tracking.
[00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:53.880]   So yeah, wait a minute.
[00:52:53.880 --> 00:52:58.880]   You, you had some technology that doesn't allow people to block ads, right?
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:52:59.880]   I call it twit.
[00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:02.880]   Well, here's the thing.
[00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:03.880]   You don't ever know we're in in that.
[00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:08.880]   I could be, we could just be going along and all of a sudden I say, you know, I love worldwide
[00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:10.880]   technology and NetApp.
[00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:14.880]   And then all of a sudden, you just think it's part of the show.
[00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:16.880]   Worldwide technology is a great company.
[00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:17.880]   It's a company you want to know about.
[00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:22.880]   We went, it was the last trip we took before COVID March of last year, we went out to St.
[00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:24.880]   Louis to see the advanced technology center.
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:25.880]   You should go.
[00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:27.880]   You would love this thing, Robert.
[00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:30.800]   It started with one building 10 years ago.
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:37.280]   It is now, I think the largest lab in the world, half a billion dollars worth of equipment
[00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:39.800]   from all of the OEMs.
[00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:41.880]   So it's rack after rack.
[00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:47.760]   Now I think at four or five buildings, a rack after rack of everything, everything in there.
[00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:52.160]   And the whole idea is that WWT's engineers can learn about this stuff.
[00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:54.960]   They can build proofs of concept.
[00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:57.440]   They can test.
[00:53:57.440 --> 00:54:02.480]   And what's really neat, and this is why I love WWT.
[00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:04.560]   You know, normally a company say, we're going to keep this to ourself.
[00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:05.560]   It's our secret sauce.
[00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:09.000]   They've opened it up so that you can use these labs too.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:14.680]   Their advanced technology center offers hundreds of on-demand and schedulable labs like NetApp's
[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:20.120]   cloud manager, along with other labs representing the newest advances in multi-cloud architecture
[00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:26.840]   and security and networking, primary and secondary storage, data analytics and AI, DevOps, everything
[00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:29.920]   that you want to know about an enterprise.
[00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:32.200]   And you can use it yourself.
[00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:34.520]   It's a lab as a service.
[00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:37.080]   So go to WWT.
[00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:42.520]   All you need to do is be a member, www.wwt.com/twit.
[00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:44.080]   Test out products and solutions.
[00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:46.720]   Just do what the WWT engineers do in effect.
[00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:48.520]   Test out products and solutions before you go to market.
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:50.080]   It's not just hands on labs.
[00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:51.080]   There's white papers there.
[00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:52.520]   There's demonstration videos.
[00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:54.480]   There's technical articles.
[00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:56.560]   There's expert insights.
[00:54:56.560 --> 00:55:01.680]   All the tools, if you want to stay up with the latest enterprise technology, this is like
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:03.640]   a graduate school in that.
[00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:09.360]   And you can, of course, if you get a chance to go to St. Louis, see the physical lab space,
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:12.920]   but it's completely online and you can access these resources.
[00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:16.800]   You don't have to go to St. Louis anywhere in the world any time of the day or night.
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:21.120]   And while you're there, by the way, make sure to check out WWT's events in the communities.
[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:26.480]   Because there's even more going on where you can discuss technology trends, hear the latest
[00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:30.400]   research, get insights from experts, meet your colleagues.
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:31.640]   It's just fantastic.
[00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:37.320]   Whatever your business needs, worldwide technology can deliver scalable, tried and tested tailor
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:38.320]   solutions.
[00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:40.400]   You know, one of the things we saw, we were in there in St. Louis.
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:45.400]   I'm looking, they have meeting room with like all these big screens and it's cameras all
[00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:46.400]   over the place.
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:49.400]   And I'm looking at what looks like kind of a factory floor.
[00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:51.000]   And there's a guy building a crate.
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:52.520]   I said, what's he doing?
[00:55:52.520 --> 00:56:01.160]   And they said, every one of our fulfillment centers has a full time on site carpenter.
[00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:04.680]   Because unlike other enterprise technology companies, they don't just send you all the
[00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:06.720]   parts to say, you put it together.
[00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:12.040]   They literally set it up, integrate it, test it, get it running, then they unplug it, build
[00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:14.560]   a custom case.
[00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:17.160]   So it fits exactly what you bought and ship it to you.
[00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:18.840]   So it's ready to go.
[00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:23.640]   I mean, that's the kind of attention to detail that makes WWT really amazing.
[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:27.840]   They bring strategy and execution together to make this new world of technology happen.
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:32.800]   To learn more about WWT, the Advanced Technology Center to get access to all these great free
[00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:34.960]   resources, it's simple.
[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:35.960]   Just create an account.
[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:39.600]   Go to www.t.com/twit.
[00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:43.360]   Create a free account on their ATC platform.
[00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:48.560]   And by the way, I have to say, if you're in St. Louis, I think you probably already know
[00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:49.560]   WWT.
[00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:51.160]   I'd never heard of them.
[00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:52.920]   Once I got there, they are beloved.
[00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:56.200]   You go anywhere, you say, we're here visiting WWT.
[00:56:56.200 --> 00:57:03.200]   They go, oh, he brought the founder of WWT brought in a speaking of soccer.
[00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:06.360]   Nicholas brought in St. Louis.
[00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:08.480]   What is the St. Louis soccer team?
[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:09.840]   He brought them into town.
[00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:10.840]   Arches?
[00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:14.800]   I lived in St. Louis for a year, so I don't know that.
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:18.520]   I'm trying to remember the name, but he brought them in.
[00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:23.520]   They actually built a worldwide technology soccer park.
[00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:24.520]   They have a club there.
[00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:26.760]   I mean, it's really cool.
[00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:29.240]   It's a really neat company.
[00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:34.280]   They really care a lot about their community.
[00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:35.280]   Where were we?
[00:57:35.280 --> 00:57:36.280]   Oh, advertising.
[00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:37.280]   Doesn't it suck?
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:38.280]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:39.280]   Just kidding.
[00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:40.280]   Just kidding.
[00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:41.640]   Honest, we're in the ad business.
[00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:42.640]   I'm kidding.
[00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:43.640]   We're in the ad business.
[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:44.640]   I'm kidding.
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:45.640]   I love it.
[00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:48.240]   Actually, Alex, you did something kind of amazing.
[00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:49.680]   I saw this on Business Insider.
[00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:54.120]   I thought, are they not going to let me look at it?
[00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:55.720]   Oh, son of a gun.
[00:57:55.720 --> 00:58:01.040]   Ah, here's a subscription I haven't paid for.
[00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:02.040]   But you do--
[00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:03.800]   Oh, if you use--
[00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:07.160]   there's a way around-- I actually emailed Henry Blodget about this, and they didn't
[00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:08.360]   fix it.
[00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:10.480]   If you use InstaPaper to read it later--
[00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:11.960]   Oh, you can read it later.
[00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:12.960]   Yeah.
[00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:16.320]   You can InstaPaper it in the entire-- or you could just right click and oftentimes the
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:17.320]   HTML.
[00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:20.440]   But I literally emailed Henry Blodget, and he said, oh, we'll get right on it.
[00:58:20.440 --> 00:58:21.800]   And they never fixed it.
[00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:26.480]   No, a lot of news paper paywalls are not great.
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:27.480]   Not such great paywalls.
[00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:29.440]   I'm going to InstaPaper it and read it.
[00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:30.440]   I think that's on purpose.
[00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:36.160]   But Alex shared his pitch deck, which is really cool, for the podcast and the newsletter.
[00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:38.440]   So I'm going to steal all your ideas, Alex.
[00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:39.440]   Thank you.
[00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:40.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:44.680]   Windows 11 comes out on Thursday.
[00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:47.840]   It goes to 11.
[00:58:47.840 --> 00:58:49.560]   We know it's going to be called Windows 11.
[00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:53.800]   There was some speculation earlier, but a leaked version came out.
[00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:58.560]   Now the question is, did Microsoft leak it on purpose?
[00:58:58.560 --> 00:59:04.240]   There's people who think Microsoft leaked it to lower expectations.
[00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:05.240]   You said you were using it.
[00:59:05.240 --> 00:59:06.240]   I did.
[00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:07.760]   Let me just confirm that they did.
[00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:08.760]   You're sure of it?
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:11.280]   Absolutely sure of it.
[00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:14.520]   When I don't have to go through a back channel to get it.
[00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:15.520]   It was pretty easy.
[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:16.920]   You can't get it now, can you?
[00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:17.920]   No.
[00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:18.920]   No.
[00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:19.920]   No.
[00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:20.920]   They plugged the whole.
[00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:21.920]   They plugged the whole.
[00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:22.920]   But look, here's the thing.
[00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:23.920]   I don't know why they'd want to lower expectations.
[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:28.200]   Yes, it's not a brand new operating system, but it's pretty.
[00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:30.680]   It feels a little bit faster in some instances.
[00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:32.080]   I like the customizability.
[00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:36.800]   I like the fact that the widget system feels less forced than it did back in the vist
[00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:37.800]   today's.
[00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:39.400]   So it's good.
[00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:41.520]   It's not a revolutionary new operating system.
[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:44.640]   People aren't going to be buying new computers just so they can run Windows 11.
[00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:47.320]   But it's not bad by any measure.
[00:59:47.320 --> 00:59:49.200]   Here's the very first thing.
[00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:53.040]   So Penos Pena 11am Eastern on Thursday.
[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:54.040]   We're going to stream it.
[00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:55.240]   Paul and Mary Jo will join me.
[00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:57.320]   We'll do a live stream.
[00:59:57.320 --> 00:59:59.440]   And then we'll do Windows Weekly instead of Wednesday.
[00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:04.640]   We'll do it afterwards because he said, "We can't do Windows Weekly before the new version
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:06.000]   of Windows comes out.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.720]   It'll be at a date."
[01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:09.560]   Alex muted.
[01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:10.560]   Are you muted?
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:11.560]   I was.
[01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:12.560]   Oh, I'm unmuted.
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:13.560]   Oh, good.
[01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:14.560]   Sorry about that.
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:15.560]   I can talk.
[01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:16.560]   I apologize.
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:17.560]   No, it was.
[01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:18.560]   I did it on my own.
[01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:19.560]   Oh, self-muted.
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:20.560]   Okay.
[01:00:20.560 --> 01:00:21.560]   It's self-improving practice.
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:22.640]   I'm not going to do that.
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:25.440]   Never will I do that.
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:26.920]   Never.
[01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:31.040]   So the thing I know people are going to be howling about, and it's the silliest thing
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:35.520]   ever, they put the start menu in the middle.
[01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:40.680]   And I know that's going to get more attention than anything else Microsoft talks about.
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:41.680]   Yeah.
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:42.680]   Yeah.
[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:43.680]   And you could, by the way, there's a switch.
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:44.680]   You can move it to the web.
[01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:45.680]   And you know what?
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:46.680]   That took me all of 30 seconds to fix.
[01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:47.680]   It looks like a mess.
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:48.680]   It did.
[01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:49.680]   Yeah.
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:51.120]   It wasn't hard to go back to the original.
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:54.640]   And then I actually put it back in the middle because I wanted to see, "Well, will this mess
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:55.640]   up my experience?"
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:00:56.640]   And it really doesn't.
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:58.760]   It took me like 10 minutes of training to go, "Oh, yeah.
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:00:59.760]   It's in the middle."
[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:00.760]   The logic makes sense.
[01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:03.440]   You don't have to move the mouse quite so far.
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:05.320]   Although does any, okay, show a hand.
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:10.200]   So how many people use the mouse to, and click the start menu to run a program?
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:11.480]   I hit the Windows key.
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:12.480]   Yeah.
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:14.440]   Windows key first three letters, you're done.
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:16.760]   I bet our audience does, if I had to guess.
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:17.760]   The consumer.
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:18.760]   And I mean that with all due respect.
[01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:19.760]   No, the people.
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:24.360]   A lot of our audiences are older folks who maybe, you know, Windows 95, XP, like they're
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:25.360]   trained.
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:29.200]   I remember when Windows 8 came out and it was the tiles and everyone was like, "This is
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:31.400]   ridiculous."
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:35.000]   I think some folks like the start menu the way it works.
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.000]   And so we'll see.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.520]   I'm kind of looking forward to Windows 11 in a manner of speaking because it's like when
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:44.080]   I saw the leaks and the start menu was in the middle, I was like, "I hope there's a way
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:47.440]   to disable that because I dislike that a great deal."
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:49.080]   It's very Mac-ish.
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:52.080]   Because that's where the Mac doc is right in the middle, right?
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:54.120]   Although the Macs don't have a start menu.
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:55.800]   But Nicholas actually just brought up a good point.
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:59.080]   I know who will like this.
[01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:00.080]   My parents.
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:01.080]   Well, why get or not?
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:05.520]   Because they will like it because they use the touchscreen and they love touching things
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:09.360]   and having it blow up on the screen and then pushing the icon that they want.
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:11.920]   So okay, there's an audience here.
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:12.920]   Okay.
[01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:13.920]   Sure.
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:16.360]   Nobody who listens to this show is that person, obviously.
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:17.360]   So can we talk?
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:20.760]   We've got some octogen areas in the chat room.
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:22.520]   Somebody in the chat room says I use a mouse.
[01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:23.520]   Okay.
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:24.520]   I have a choice.
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:25.600]   But can we talk?
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:27.440]   I mean, it's keyboard.
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:29.840]   I had a woman call me yesterday.
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:30.920]   I felt so bad for her.
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:38.640]   In fact, I didn't really answer her question because AT&T has started requiring—this is
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:42.160]   the kind of thing you're going to hear about, Nicholas, like crazy—has started requiring
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:46.040]   that you use an app-specific password to use AT&T mail.
[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:51.160]   So she says, "I kept getting this pop-up saying your mail settings need to be adjusted
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:54.280]   and I kept saying fix it and it never fixed it.
[01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:58.680]   And so eventually I just said, "Forget it and now my mail doesn't work."
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:00.960]   And I said, "Well, do you use a browser for your mail?"
[01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:01.960]   She says, "I don't know.
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:02.960]   There's an icon on the thing."
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:06.120]   And I clicked that and I said, "Okay, you're using an app, I think.
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:07.680]   Who knows what she's got?"
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:09.080]   I said, "Did somebody set this up for you?"
[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:10.720]   She said, "Yes."
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:14.640]   I said, "Well, here's what AT&T wants you to do.
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:20.120]   You have to set up an application-specific password at AT&T's website to continue to
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:22.200]   use your ISP's email."
[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:23.480]   I'm talking to this woman.
[01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:27.400]   She doesn't know if she's using a browser or a mail client and I have to explain how
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:29.880]   to set up an app-specific password.
[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:33.480]   I don't even know if I can get her into the settings.
[01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:40.920]   So this is why I wonder, "Why do these people use computers?
[01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:43.840]   Your life must be so hard.
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:46.960]   I just feel so sorry for these people."
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:49.600]   That's why some people still use their AOL addresses.
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:52.840]   Oh, I get that person all the time.
[01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:58.680]   I just feel so sorry for them.
[01:03:58.680 --> 01:03:59.680]   Yeah.
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:00.680]   What do you-
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:03.880]   Again, that's my audience and those are the people I write for.
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:04.880]   Right.
[01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:05.880]   I love them.
[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:07.520]   They're real people.
[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:12.560]   These are real people who don't care about the shiny windows.
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:14.880]   No, they're trying to find pictures of the grandkids.
[01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:16.400]   They're trying to pay the bills.
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:17.400]   They're trying to live their lives.
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:24.240]   They're not trying to admire the translucent windows on Windows 11 or whatever or the
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:26.600]   arrow effects or whatever they used to call it.
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:28.760]   There's fundamentally not- They don't care.
[01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:31.600]   It's called fluid design.
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:32.600]   Great.
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:33.600]   Perfect.
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:35.600]   That's a great name.
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:40.520]   For most people, it's like an application-specific password.
[01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:43.320]   I cannot imagine trying something on the radio.
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:44.320]   That seems like-
[01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:45.320]   On the radio, I give up.
[01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:46.320]   That seems very difficult.
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:47.320]   I give up.
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:51.880]   When the leaks were happening and the big leak was last week, which I haven't tried yet
[01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:52.880]   to be fair.
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:53.880]   No, I haven't.
[01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:54.880]   I will when they officially released it.
[01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:55.880]   I like Robin.
[01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:56.880]   I like Robin.
[01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:57.880]   Paul.
[01:04:57.880 --> 01:04:58.880]   It'll be great.
[01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:01.080]   First off, these just seems like cosmetic changes.
[01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:02.080]   It's like, "Oh, we'll move the things to the-
[01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:03.080]   It's totally cosmetic."
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:04.080]   With the three days-
[01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:05.080]   Within three days.
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:06.080]   Within three days.
[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:07.080]   Paul, why is that-
[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:09.040]   Why do they even need a press conference for them?
[01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:10.040]   Maybe it'll be a pretaken thing.
[01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:12.920]   Oh, I was wondering this too.
[01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:17.440]   Because I, like probably everybody who's listening, said, "Oh, I know.
[01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:19.880]   Finally, Microsoft's going to start over.
[01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:23.640]   Redesign Windows, make it robust, reliable, secure.
[01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:25.920]   MIT technology-
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:31.800]   No, actually it was Steve Gibson, our security guy, said, "There's one reason for the ransomware
[01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:32.800]   crisis.
[01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:33.800]   One reason alone.
[01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:34.800]   Windows.
[01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:36.600]   It's so freaking insecure."
[01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:40.840]   I think there's other reasons, but I understand his point.
[01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:42.440]   I thought, "Here's an opportunity.
[01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:47.760]   That's the only reason you should update Windows 10 is because you're going to start over.
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:49.480]   They're not starting over.
[01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:53.600]   They're not changing anything except how it looks."
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:58.680]   I'm asking Paul and Mary Jo, our Windows host, why then do this?
[01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:02.200]   They came up with the only cogent reason I could think of.
[01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:06.720]   Last year, the PC industry had a banner year because everybody had to go out and buy a
[01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:10.680]   computer for the kid who's got to do Zoom classes.
[01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:13.000]   I'm working at home, so I need a better computer.
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:16.480]   The computer sales were the best they'd been in a decade.
[01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:21.240]   This year, of course, it's going to tank because everybody bought a computer.
[01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:22.240]   It's going to die.
[01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:23.720]   The PC industry is going to be dead.
[01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:25.840]   Also, because the one can get components.
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:27.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:29.760]   You can't even get one if you wanted one.
[01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:33.320]   What Microsoft, Paul and Mary Jo think that the reason Microsoft's doing Windows 11 is
[01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:36.320]   because historically, that's what sells computers.
[01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:40.400]   In the Windows world, people don't buy the next version of Windows.
[01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:45.760]   They buy a new computer to run the next version of Windows, and they continue to use that
[01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:50.000]   version of Windows until they buy another computer.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:56.280]   Microsoft's basically artificially supporting the PC industry because there's no way anybody's
[01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:59.480]   going to buy a new computer unless there's some reason to, and this reason is going to
[01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:00.480]   be Windows 11.
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:01.480]   It's Windows SpinalTap.
[01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:04.960]   It's the same thing, but it goes to 11.
[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:09.840]   That sounds like if they were to say that out loud, I imagine a lot of folks in my
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:11.080]   industry would be like, "Yeah, that's fine.
[01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:12.080]   That seems fair.
[01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:13.720]   We want to keep things going."
[01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:18.040]   Don't necessarily tell me that it's because of these great innovations that because the
[01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:21.360]   default is light mode and we moved to the center.
[01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:25.960]   It's like, I don't know, that feels like changing a window manager.
[01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:26.960]   I'm like, "I don't know.
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:28.960]   This feels whatever."
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:30.920]   Well, you know, I feel substantial.
[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:34.400]   Especially when Microsoft said when Windows 10 was announced, I was like, "Oh, Windows
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:35.760]   10, Windows is a service now.
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.360]   They'll be incremental upgrades.
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:41.760]   This is the last version of Windows.
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:44.640]   Maybe we'll just forget that that said, which is again fine.
[01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:45.640]   I don't know.
[01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:48.040]   You know, because it's Panos Pena.
[01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:53.560]   He's going to come out on the stage saying, "We have created a new way for you to think
[01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:55.640]   to create to live.
[01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:56.640]   We have taken..."
[01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:57.640]   Wow, wow.
[01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:02.960]   You know, he's going to have some florid description of this that's going to be, "Oh,
[01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:05.560]   my God, this is changing the world."
[01:08:05.560 --> 01:08:08.920]   And all it is is I got rounded corners.
[01:08:08.920 --> 01:08:14.920]   We found that the only thing missing from Windows was rounded corners.
[01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:15.920]   Which is fine.
[01:08:15.920 --> 01:08:16.920]   That's great.
[01:08:16.920 --> 01:08:18.560]   That doesn't bother me.
[01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:22.840]   But if he's going to explain it in this florid language, it is certainly not.
[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:23.840]   Well, that's what he does.
[01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:24.840]   I don't know.
[01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:25.840]   That's his thing.
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:26.920]   This could spark an entirely new industry.
[01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:30.680]   Everyone's going to want to upgrade their monitors for rounded corners.
[01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:33.160]   Anthony, do you have my audio?
[01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:35.280]   Let me see if you do here because I want to play.
[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:36.280]   Oh, no.
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:37.880]   What are you laughing at?
[01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:44.520]   What is the most important change from Tom Warren, the new Windows 10 startup sound?
[01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:47.640]   I hope it comes out of the right hole.
[01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:50.560]   Oh, my God.
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:53.240]   I got to have it.
[01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:56.240]   You know, the first time I booted up, I didn't even notice.
[01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:58.280]   I did not notice that until I read the Verge article.
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:01.800]   I said, "Oh, yeah, it is different."
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:02.800]   So you've heard it.
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:03.800]   I have heard it.
[01:09:03.800 --> 01:09:04.800]   That's it.
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:07.640]   It's not trouble for saying this, but that's why people like Apple.
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:13.240]   I mean, for all the bad things that we're, I'm pretty critical of that company, but these
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:15.560]   shenanigans just don't happen in the Apple ecosystem.
[01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:17.000]   The wallpaper is very pretty.
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:18.240]   Apple always does new wallpaper.
[01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:20.240]   The new Windows 11 wallpaper is gorgeous.
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:21.240]   It is nice.
[01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:22.360]   No, the color scheme is very nice.
[01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:25.200]   I mean, it is a lot of eye candy.
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:29.240]   I would like to dive down below to see anything that they changed.
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:32.240]   As far as I can tell, they don't think they have.
[01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:33.560]   They don't want to.
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:39.160]   This is the problem that Microsoft has is they can't break all the existing software.
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:41.080]   So they can't change anything.
[01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:45.200]   When they change the device model in, what was that?
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:51.120]   Windows, I want to say Windows 7, all hell broke loose for years.
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:55.400]   Hardware didn't work when the device driver model was changed.
[01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:57.000]   You can't screw with that.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:01.520]   So make a new startup set and leave.
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:02.520]   Not good work.
[01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:07.400]   I mean, that is a hard thing to figure out.
[01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:08.400]   Oh, I agree.
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:11.080]   How do you, we can't redesign Windows.
[01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:15.080]   We have, you know, infinity billion users of this thing.
[01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:16.080]   How do we improve it?
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:18.280]   I mean, if you ask me, Windows 10 is like pretty good.
[01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:19.280]   Like I don't, I don't.
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:20.280]   Fine.
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:21.280]   Any, like exactly.
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:22.280]   It's fine.
[01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:23.280]   It's fine.
[01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:24.560]   And I use that word to my editors all the time.
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:29.520]   And they're always, the word fine now internally gets in the courts means like amazing because
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:31.160]   it's like, oh, Nicholas has called it fine.
[01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:33.360]   It's like, that means it is not amazing.
[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:34.360]   It's functional.
[01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:35.360]   It works.
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:37.960]   It does the job and everyone gets to follow the door.
[01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:39.600]   I wish it were secure.
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:40.600]   That would be nice.
[01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:43.680]   So that's what I'd like to see Microsoft really working.
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:48.680]   I'm sure they're working as hard as they can, but it's just, it's plugging a leaky boat
[01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:50.720]   with, you know, chewing gum.
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:54.560]   Well, I mean, anything that has as much adoption as Windows is never going to be completely
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:57.560]   secure, even if it's up to date on cash is true.
[01:10:57.560 --> 01:11:01.720]   Just because the way that most people use Windows is insecure.
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:02.720]   Humans are the problem.
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:03.960]   Humans mess everything up.
[01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:07.560]   Yeah, you humans are ruining it for all of us.
[01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:11.280]   Oh, all right.
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:13.200]   I though I'm excited.
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:15.560]   It's always nice to see a new refreshed look.
[01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:16.560]   That's fun.
[01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:17.560]   It is cool.
[01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:18.560]   It is exciting.
[01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:19.560]   It's like, oh, right.
[01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:20.760]   Thursday, I got a cool thing to look forward to.
[01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:21.760]   When's is 11?
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:22.760]   Yeah, we're kind of teasing.
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:23.840]   Oh, it looks a little different.
[01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:27.200]   But this is like this type of stuff does actually excite.
[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:30.440]   If I were like, I don't know, like a dentist or whatever, I would probably be watching
[01:11:30.440 --> 01:11:34.640]   the Windows 11 live stream because I'm like, ooh, this, let's see what they ask.
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:35.640]   It's just fun.
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:38.240]   That's actually what I'm saying is substance here.
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:41.280]   Is those people are going to be disappointed because it isn't substantially?
[01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:44.960]   We're pulling it, but there is a huge audience for things that are pretty.
[01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:45.960]   Yeah.
[01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:49.040]   And if it's the same thing and it looks prettier, they'll use it.
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:50.040]   Yeah.
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:51.040]   Yeah, no, it's good.
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:52.040]   Well, they buy, there's a question.
[01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:53.040]   Will they go out and buy a PC?
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:54.040]   Can they even buy a PC?
[01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:56.400]   No, no, not after the market.
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:58.920]   So, well, Microsoft, so here's my question.
[01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:03.120]   Will Microsoft charge for this new version of Windows?
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:07.360]   No, but they will probably charge for the hooks.
[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:11.920]   So they've put some hooks into Windows 11 to make it easier for them to platform.
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:16.200]   And you already know about Xbox, but I think they want to push a bit more.
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:21.760]   I think Microsoft actually wants to get a little bit more of the net services pie.
[01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:24.560]   And Windows 11 makes it easier for them to do that.
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:25.560]   Yeah.
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:26.560]   Okay.
[01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:27.560]   Yeah.
[01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:30.240]   So 11 is more of a portal than 10 was.
[01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:31.240]   Yeah.
[01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:34.400]   There's money there.
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:38.200]   That sounds good for Microsoft, but not for everybody's readers necessarily.
[01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:39.200]   Yeah.
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:40.200]   Yeah.
[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:41.200]   Maybe it might be.
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:42.200]   I don't know.
[01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:45.760]   Am I biased when I say that Windows is kind of the epitome of mediocrity?
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:47.640]   It's fine.
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:50.960]   But in this instance, mediocrity is not bad.
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:54.200]   Mediocrity also means everyone knows how to use it.
[01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:55.200]   Yeah.
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:13:00.960]   I just feel sorry for that poor woman who is trying to figure out what an application
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:02.720]   specific password is.
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:07.480]   Her problem is not Windows is AT&T, but then figure she should.
[01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:11.280]   I just try to push people towards Chromebooks and iPads, honestly.
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:12.760]   Is that is that the right thing to do?
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:13.760]   You think?
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:14.760]   What about you, Nicholas?
[01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:15.760]   Do you?
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:16.760]   Do you?
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:20.840]   We have seen a huge interest, explosive interest of Chromebooks over the past year, obviously
[01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:22.440]   for the pandemic and folks working from home.
[01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:26.880]   I think a Chromebook is a good idea for a lot of folks.
[01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:31.680]   An iPad as well, my uncle who recently retired from the career in law enforcement.
[01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:35.440]   He's kind of a caveman and I mean that with all due respect.
[01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:39.560]   The iPad is great for him because he just clicks Safari and he browsers his like boxing
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:41.280]   websites and he turns it off.
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:43.320]   He doesn't need a, he doesn't need a Windows PC.
[01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:44.320]   No.
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:45.880]   He doesn't need a MacBook Pro.
[01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:47.880]   He's very, very simple.
[01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:48.880]   Simple is good.
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:52.120]   Simple is hard too to make something simple and make something good.
[01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:54.800]   It's obviously tricky to pull off.
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:59.960]   But yeah, I think a Chromebook, a lot of our readers have definitely warmed to the Chromebook.
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:05.120]   At least people reaching out and asking me, people reading articles about Chromebooks,
[01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:06.440]   producing Chromebooks.
[01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:09.880]   There's a lot of interest in Chromebooks it feels.
[01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:15.960]   If you're a nerd, if you're an enthusiast, you should be using Linux.
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:21.000]   I mean, honestly, you should get the same hardware, put Linux on it.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.000]   If you're a...
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000]   It's a Luna Ubuntu.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.000]   I like Linux.
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:26.000]   Linux is good.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:27.000]   Linux is reliable.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:28.000]   It's solid.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.240]   Maybe because it's a small target.
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:33.000]   It's not as insecure probably because it's a small target.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:39.560]   I'm sure it would be if just as insecure as Windows if it were as dominant as Windows.
[01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:42.200]   I gave my parents Max.
[01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:43.200]   They didn't like them.
[01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:44.680]   I don't think Max are any better.
[01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:46.720]   And then I give them Chromebooks and they didn't like them.
[01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:47.720]   They didn't like them.
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:48.720]   They went back to the Windows.
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:49.720]   They want a Windows.
[01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:50.720]   Yeah.
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:55.000]   I wish I could say, "I'll get a Mac because it's the computer for the rest of us.
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.320]   It's easy to use blah, blah, blah."
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:58.240]   I don't think it's that much difference.
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:04.600]   I hate whenever I'm complaining about something with Windows and at least five of the top six
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:07.320]   comments will be to get a Mac.
[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:08.320]   That doesn't help.
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:09.320]   It's the same problem.
[01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:10.320]   It doesn't help.
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:11.320]   It's a similar problem.
[01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:17.320]   I mean, I like lots of like about it, but I think it's a similar problem.
[01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:25.160]   So remember at the about this time last year, both Apple and Google announced, "Hey, we're
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:30.040]   going to create an API, privacy forward API for contact tracing.
[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:32.240]   It's going to solve the pandemic.
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:34.080]   Everybody's going to have it on their phone.
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:39.240]   Every state's going to come out with an app and bingo, ba-dong-boong-boong-boong-boo.
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:40.640]   COVID-19 will disappear.
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:41.880]   They weren't to be fair.
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:45.040]   The only people who thought COVID-19 will disappear.
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:52.520]   MIT Media Lab has now come out with a report that says, "Contact tracing apps not only didn't
[01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:59.200]   take off hardly anybody made one, and they didn't do anything.
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:02.400]   It was a perfect example of Silicon Valley hubris.
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:04.600]   Like, "Oh, we're smart.
[01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:05.600]   We can figure this.
[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:06.600]   We'll feed.
[01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:08.320]   Hey, hold my beer."
[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:10.520]   Nothing.
[01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:12.760]   Make sense?
[01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:13.760]   Agree?
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:14.760]   Disagree?
[01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:21.040]   The problem with a contract tracing app is it can tell you if you have come into close
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:25.880]   contact with someone who was infected, it did nothing to change what you will do with
[01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:26.880]   that information.
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:29.280]   I had learned that's not an easy thing.
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:32.120]   I turned it on right away.
[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:36.520]   In a year, I have had zero contacts.
[01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:37.840]   I mean, nothing.
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:41.360]   The only time I've had contacts was in the Vatican.
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:45.280]   Oh, really?
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:46.280]   Oh, really?
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:47.280]   You've been near somebody with COVID?
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:48.280]   Oh.
[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:51.280]   That's probably because so many people have had it.
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:52.280]   Yeah.
[01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:54.160]   Here's why I think that this stuff didn't work.
[01:16:54.160 --> 01:16:59.360]   It was because of asymptomatic nature in the beginning of the disease.
[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:03.680]   You're not going to test positive right away and you're not going to have any symptoms.
[01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:07.200]   Once that happens, the whole idea of contact tracing is off the table.
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:10.640]   Think about how many people you're going to come into contact with every day.
[01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:13.120]   When you have no idea, so you have five days in your life.
[01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:14.040]   You don't know you have COVID.
[01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:15.800]   You test positive for COVID.
[01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:16.800]   How many contacts?
[01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:22.720]   If you're a somewhat busy person, it could be dozens or maybe even above 100 people that
[01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:25.720]   you've come in contact with, let's say, when grocery shopping.
[01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:28.640]   So now are all those people going to have to quarantine?
[01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:32.560]   It just became a point because of the nature of this disease that if you are going to actually
[01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:37.000]   put contact tracing into place, you might as well just shut down all society for a couple
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.960]   of weeks and then resume after that.
[01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:43.200]   Yeah, because it's never got to the place where you're going to do that.
[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:44.880]   It's totalitarian countries like China.
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:49.960]   It worked because they were willing to exactly weld the door shut and say nobody's leaving.
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:54.040]   In most Western countries, the people who would benefit from a contract tracing app were
[01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:58.520]   already not putting themselves into a position where they would need a contact tracing app.
[01:17:58.520 --> 01:17:59.920]   Yeah, we were staying home anyway.
[01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:00.920]   We were staying home anyway.
[01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:02.520]   So what was the use?
[01:18:02.520 --> 01:18:04.240]   And then it doesn't get picked up on the test.
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:05.800]   So you do contact tracing.
[01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:06.800]   Okay, you got notified.
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:08.480]   You had a contact, then you get tested.
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:13.200]   So if this contact tracing actually worked according to plan, you get a ping every couple
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:14.200]   of weeks probably.
[01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:15.200]   Right.
[01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:16.200]   Then you go and get tested.
[01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:17.280]   You have no idea if you have a disease.
[01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:19.880]   It just wasn't something that lent itself to contact tracing.
[01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:23.640]   It really was going to be either one of two options, well, maybe three options.
[01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:26.360]   One is the totalitarian option, which we saw in China.
[01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:29.120]   Two is everybody in the population wears masks.
[01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:32.040]   Three is you kind of hold your breath and wait till the vaccine.
[01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:35.080]   And so there have been different countries that have gone about different, gone about
[01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:36.080]   it different ways.
[01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:41.000]   Obviously, the US plan, most likely thing we're always going to do is wait for the technology
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.000]   to bail us out.
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.000]   And it did.
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:48.760]   MIT technology review does say there might down the road, this might have some value,
[01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:50.280]   but we should learn some lessons from this.
[01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:54.720]   And the chief lesson was the public didn't trust it.
[01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:59.000]   So people were, this is another case where people were so worried about privacy.
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:03.720]   Google and Apple designed a lot of privacy into this so much so that public health officials
[01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:07.040]   said, well, it's not going to be any good for us because we don't, we can't find out
[01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:08.320]   who's exposed.
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:12.520]   Twenty five states rolled out apps.
[01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:16.680]   They surveyed all the states, twenty five states in DC.
[01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:21.520]   Virginia was the first to make it available to its residents in August, which was kind
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:22.840]   of late.
[01:19:22.840 --> 01:19:24.920]   Others are only getting started now.
[01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:30.200]   Massachusetts began testing its app in April of this year.
[01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:32.280]   So a little late.
[01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:36.120]   By the way, the Massachusetts app is kind of interesting because there's been a lot of
[01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:40.280]   anecdotal reports that Google is installing it automatically on people's phones.
[01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:41.280]   Did you see that?
[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:44.120]   Oh, I see nothing wrong with that.
[01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:47.720]   I mean, sorry, I couldn't say it with the straight face.
[01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:48.880]   I tried.
[01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:54.080]   I don't, I don't, I don't, well, guys will get to the bottom of it at some point.
[01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:55.360]   Maybe they turned on.
[01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:57.480]   See, I did that on my iPhone.
[01:19:57.480 --> 01:20:01.720]   I turned on and it said whenever California comes up with one, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:02.720]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:03.720]   It shouldn't be installed automatically.
[01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:04.720]   My device, my rules.
[01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:05.720]   Yeah.
[01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:06.720]   Yeah.
[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:10.240]   Well, like we are so furiously independent here.
[01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:14.240]   So even if this stuff worked to perfection, we're going to voluntarily quarantine.
[01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:17.880]   That didn't seem like it was really going to happen in this country.
[01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:18.880]   No.
[01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:19.880]   That's true.
[01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:20.880]   All right.
[01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:22.960]   So, well, you know, it's good though.
[01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:26.920]   You should do a postmortem after this stuff and see this, did this work?
[01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:28.720]   The technology is interesting.
[01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:30.080]   But they did to anonymize the data.
[01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:32.520]   It was actually interesting and encouraging.
[01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:38.960]   But I think we're right here in that this kind of disease just wasn't good for contact
[01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:44.120]   tracing because there is such a long incubation period.
[01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:48.120]   It's not effective because all that it takes is one person who says, oh, the contact tracing
[01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:52.240]   app told me that I was exposed and I wasn't and something no one, no one trusts me.
[01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:53.240]   Yeah.
[01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:54.760]   Well, there is one bright light.
[01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:58.440]   We actually made a vaccine faster than ever before.
[01:20:58.440 --> 01:21:00.880]   And there's a technology that has some real promise.
[01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:02.760]   Well, we did and we did.
[01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:03.760]   With mRNA.
[01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:07.240]   Because, I mean, this vaccine was being developed before COVID.
[01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:08.240]   Right.
[01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:10.400]   And it's 20 years in the making before we got to 2020.
[01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:11.400]   Yeah.
[01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:17.000]   But now we've got this idea that we can, using mRNA, we can, you know, over a couple of days
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.440]   genetically sequenced the disease.
[01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:24.600]   And a couple of days later, using computer technology, create a potential vaccine for
[01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:25.600]   it.
[01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:27.360]   Of course, you still have to test it on humans and things like that.
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:28.920]   We just eliminate that part.
[01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:34.240]   And then, you know, and I have a feeling with variants and boosters and so forth, we may
[01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:35.880]   actually be doing this again and again.
[01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:37.080]   And now it's not going away.
[01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:42.200]   And now companies are talking about using it for other illnesses, including HIV, that
[01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:45.440]   mRNA may be a kind of a golden tool.
[01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:48.160]   So there's some, you know, there's things we learned.
[01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:52.920]   New York State has passed a right to repair bill in the assembly.
[01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:57.880]   Oh, no, I'm sorry, in the Senate of New York State, but it still has to pass the assembly.
[01:21:57.880 --> 01:22:02.520]   It's the first legislative, this surprises me because I know many states were considering
[01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:03.680]   right to repair acts.
[01:22:03.680 --> 01:22:09.800]   It's the first legislative body in the US to pass a right to repair bill.
[01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:13.920]   Still though, there's a gulf between that and it actually becoming the law of the land
[01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:16.180]   or the law of the state.
[01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:19.760]   This makes sense in New York because when you're talking about right to repair, you're most
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:24.360]   often talking about phones, small items, phones, computers, maybe even cars.
[01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:29.360]   I want to see this tested in like the Midwest where people would be saying you have a right
[01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:30.360]   to repair your track.
[01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:31.800]   It's about John Deere.
[01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:37.940]   The two companies that have been fighting this most viciously are Apple and John Deere.
[01:22:37.940 --> 01:22:39.680]   You're right.
[01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:41.680]   I mean, it'd be interesting to see if this passes.
[01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:46.540]   It may not even pass through the Senate.
[01:22:46.540 --> 01:22:49.060]   I think it's just a calendar thing.
[01:22:49.060 --> 01:22:51.540]   I think the legislative session ends this week.
[01:22:51.540 --> 01:22:52.540]   Right.
[01:22:52.540 --> 01:22:55.500]   There's a lot of momentum behind this idea.
[01:22:55.500 --> 01:22:56.540]   I've covered right to repair.
[01:22:56.540 --> 01:22:59.460]   I was at Motherboard for a couple of years ago.
[01:22:59.460 --> 01:23:02.460]   We cover our right to appear here at Consumer Reports.
[01:23:02.460 --> 01:23:06.260]   It's not a primary issue that we care about, but it's the idea of ownership.
[01:23:06.260 --> 01:23:07.460]   This is my thing.
[01:23:07.460 --> 01:23:11.460]   I remember once when I was reporting on a right to repair story, I was on the phone
[01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:17.480]   with apparently there's a lobbying group for small appliances like toasters and things
[01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:18.480]   like that.
[01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:23.600]   I basically told them, I was like, "Look, if I buy a toaster and I smash it with a sledgehammer,
[01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:25.400]   why is it anyone's business but mine?"
[01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:28.400]   The people on the other than the phone thought I was a crazy person.
[01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:30.400]   Why would you ever do that?
[01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:32.080]   The point is I bought this and it's mine.
[01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:33.080]   It's mine.
[01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:34.080]   I can do anything I want.
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:37.880]   If I want to turn it into a huffer car, I should be able to do that.
[01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:41.980]   There's like to me, it is a real fundamental thing is like I bought this thing, it is mine.
[01:23:41.980 --> 01:23:44.300]   If I want to use it as you've designed it, great.
[01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:49.500]   If I want to physically destroy it for a fun YouTube video, that's my business.
[01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:52.420]   Your relationship with this product ended when I purchased it.
[01:23:52.420 --> 01:23:56.100]   I don't want you to have any say so over what I do with it.
[01:23:56.100 --> 01:23:59.460]   A lot of companies just have a real, because it's bad.
[01:23:59.460 --> 01:24:03.900]   Oh, if something happens to it, it's just a weird branding thing.
[01:24:03.900 --> 01:24:04.900]   It's that.
[01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:06.580]   But Apple's position is also, you could make it.
[01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:10.140]   If you got somebody, third party repair the screen and the screen is intimately connected
[01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:14.600]   with a fingerprint reader, you could inadvertently, that person could inadvertently make your
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:17.840]   device insecure, you wouldn't know that.
[01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:22.020]   And so we want to make sure, which actually would argue that they give people training
[01:24:22.020 --> 01:24:24.280]   in manuals and parts.
[01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:27.880]   Not just say, don't do it, you got to do it at the Apple store.
[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:28.880]   I don't.
[01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:32.840]   Almost as if Apple's exploiting the privacy angle in order to sell more devices.
[01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:35.200]   They wouldn't do that.
[01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:39.800]   I haven't seen dozens of commercials that were doing specifically that over the last week.
[01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:41.800]   Oh, okay, good.
[01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:49.040]   But okay, so on the downside, I think on this panel, I think we're all pretty much on the
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:50.040]   right to repair site.
[01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:51.040]   Yes.
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:52.040]   I mean, it's our devices.
[01:24:52.040 --> 01:24:53.040]   We've bought them and paid for them.
[01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:55.140]   We should be able to tinker with them.
[01:24:55.140 --> 01:25:01.280]   The downsides inside would be there are certain devices that interact with other devices that
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:02.280]   we don't own.
[01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:03.280]   Perhaps.
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:08.040]   And in those instances, maybe the right to repair must be interpreted a bit.
[01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:12.000]   That was Apple's argument against jailbreaking, allowing jailbreaking is if you jailbreak
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.480]   your phone, it doesn't just impact you.
[01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:14.920]   It pecs the network.
[01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:15.920]   Right, right.
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:21.320]   But like a right to repair a car, a Tesla that has auto drive features that you could
[01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:22.480]   really screw up.
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:23.480]   That might be a problem.
[01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:24.480]   That might be a problem.
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:28.640]   Medical devices that are connected to a network that might also be a problem.
[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:31.200]   So yes, I am gung ho on right to repair.
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:34.040]   I think we should air on the side of right to repair.
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:40.760]   But I think you need to identify those instances where no, this is not just your device.
[01:25:40.760 --> 01:25:41.760]   You didn't just buy it.
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:44.280]   It's connected to a larger ecosystem that you could mess up.
[01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:45.880]   And therefore there need to be restrictions.
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:46.880]   Yeah.
[01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:51.480]   I agree to a point, but I could take my car to any mechanic on Main Street in New York
[01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:52.480]   State and he could fix it.
[01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:55.320]   I don't need Toyota or Honda's permission.
[01:25:55.320 --> 01:26:00.120]   If I want to get my iPhone fixed, I theoretically need Apple's permission, which is great if
[01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:03.200]   I live near an Apple authorized repair center.
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:05.640]   But if I don't, that's not good.
[01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:06.640]   Yeah.
[01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:07.640]   So yeah.
[01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:10.340]   And I mean, you've got the right to repair your car in that you could change the tire.
[01:26:10.340 --> 01:26:14.240]   You could do that poorly and endanger everyone on the freeway, but we don't say people aren't
[01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:15.760]   allowed to change their own tire.
[01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:19.720]   So yeah, I think there's no clear barrier.
[01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:20.720]   Exactly.
[01:26:20.720 --> 01:26:22.000]   But that you have to keep that in mind.
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:27.640]   I think because so many of our devices are interconnected, we at least need to consider
[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:31.840]   what are the ramifications of allowing people to do anything they want with a device that
[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:34.280]   then interacts with other people.
[01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:43.060]   FTC came out with a report in May of this year in which they said that making repairs
[01:26:43.060 --> 01:26:47.280]   harder actually makes independent repair less safe.
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:51.720]   They also didn't buy the arguments that independent repair threatens customer security or opens
[01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:56.800]   manufacturers up to liability, having found no evidence of either.
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:27:00.520]   And they also noted that repair restrictions that limit the business of independent repair
[01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:06.520]   shops cause harm to local economies and disproportionately hurt the poor and minorities.
[01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:12.640]   So when you, I think it's pretty clear that although Apple tries and John Deere tries to
[01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:19.240]   dress it in some other clothing, it really is just, hey, it's our money and we want it.
[01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:20.240]   We're going to.
[01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:24.600]   And honestly, you say you can repair your Toyota, but good luck if you have trouble with the
[01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:25.600]   ignition system.
[01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:31.040]   I mean, nowadays you need a computer and only dealers have those computers, you know, and
[01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:36.360]   I think that that's perhaps a symptom of the complexity of the world we live in and the
[01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:37.360]   devices we use.
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:40.320]   I love tinkering with an old vehicle.
[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:41.320]   Old cars is different.
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:42.320]   I have a shaker.
[01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:43.560]   No, not a computer chip in it.
[01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:45.480]   I used to turn up my Volkswagen.
[01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:46.480]   Yeah.
[01:27:46.480 --> 01:27:49.440]   You all you need is a voltmeter and a wrench and.
[01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:52.160]   And I thought I would love the computer age where I could just plug it in and reprogram
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:56.920]   it with my computer, but I mean, not it's not really satisfying.
[01:27:56.920 --> 01:28:00.360]   But honestly, that's every car these days.
[01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:01.360]   Yeah.
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:03.360]   I mean, they're, they're, they're re-idiously complex.
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:06.880]   Well, when you had the Tesla, these are, was complaining that it crashed every once in
[01:28:06.880 --> 01:28:08.960]   a while, not like, never actually crash.
[01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:10.480]   The computer just froze up.
[01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:11.480]   Oh, everyone's.
[01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:14.280]   Yeah, there's a three button salute actually for the Tesla.
[01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:15.280]   There's a reset.
[01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:16.280]   I don't like that.
[01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:20.640]   Well, it's, it's, it's, it's not the actual drive train.
[01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:21.640]   It's just the telematics.
[01:28:21.640 --> 01:28:22.840]   The entertainment and all that stuff.
[01:28:22.840 --> 01:28:24.440]   But aren't those all tied together?
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:26.600]   I think so.
[01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:29.000]   I mean, that's, you know, I don't know.
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:33.000]   I, she won't, wouldn't let me get another Tesla.
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.600]   Everybody who owns a Tesla loves their Tesla until they get rid of it.
[01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:40.080]   And then, but I, I was just nervous about buying another one, I thought.
[01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:43.240]   I kind of want to get one of those new Ford F-150s, the old electric.
[01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:44.880]   Oh, I really want those.
[01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:46.520]   I have the, you saw it out here.
[01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:47.520]   I plug it in my house.
[01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:48.520]   I plug it in my house.
[01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:49.520]   I get it in my house.
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:50.520]   I love it.
[01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:51.520]   Power my house for three days during an emergency.
[01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:52.520]   Great idea.
[01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:53.520]   Yeah.
[01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:54.520]   Yeah.
[01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:55.520]   You could do that with a Tesla too, by the way.
[01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:56.520]   But the battery pack in an F-150 is way bigger.
[01:28:56.520 --> 01:28:57.520]   Oh, it's a lot of stuff.
[01:28:57.520 --> 01:28:58.520]   Way, way bigger.
[01:28:58.520 --> 01:28:59.520]   Yep.
[01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:00.520]   Yep.
[01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:02.160]   Are you into the Tesla Cybertruck?
[01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:04.520]   Is that your next move after this F-150?
[01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:05.520]   No.
[01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:07.800]   The battle, the battle truck.
[01:29:07.800 --> 01:29:09.520]   You know what that, the Mad Max battle truck?
[01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:10.520]   You know what that looks like?
[01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:13.800]   Do you remember there used to be an arcade game called Battle Zone with the fact that
[01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:15.480]   it looks just like a battle zone truck.
[01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:17.800]   The Tesla Cybertruck looks exactly like a chip in that game.
[01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:18.800]   No, you're right.
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:19.800]   I'm not that game.
[01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:24.880]   Sam Ebull Samett, who's our car guy, says it's highly unlikely that the Cybertruck will
[01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:27.320]   ship in that format.
[01:29:27.320 --> 01:29:29.160]   It's not going to be the battle truck.
[01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:31.160]   I just want to go to Tesla dealer ships for a while.
[01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:32.160]   It is cool.
[01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:33.160]   It's cool.
[01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:34.160]   It's cool.
[01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:36.160]   Look at those hexagonal tires.
[01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:37.160]   It does look like a cheapie.
[01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:39.160]   I think it's a beautiful car.
[01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:40.160]   Really?
[01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:41.160]   You think that's beautiful?
[01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:42.160]   Absolutely.
[01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:43.240]   I feel like it's my kind of car.
[01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:44.560]   It's got the, you know what?
[01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:46.000]   It kind of looks like a DeLorean.
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:47.840]   It's got that angular type thing going on.
[01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:49.080]   It's also the brushed metal.
[01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:51.080]   That's why it's so sweet.
[01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:56.360]   Look at that thing.
[01:29:56.360 --> 01:29:58.200]   I would drive it just because of the looks.
[01:29:58.200 --> 01:29:59.640]   I mean, I'll get the hot wheels.
[01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:00.640]   People will be terrified.
[01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:03.200]   They think the tech squad was going to pile on it.
[01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:04.200]   That's true.
[01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:06.640]   It does look like it is sort of a mercenary car.
[01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:07.640]   It's very villainous.
[01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:08.640]   It's very, very low.
[01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:09.640]   Oh, man.
[01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:10.640]   Low observability from radar.
[01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:11.640]   Dang.
[01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:12.640]   Look at that.
[01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:13.640]   You like the tech?
[01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:14.640]   You like the tech?
[01:30:14.640 --> 01:30:17.640]   When they announced that they had a little one.
[01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:22.440]   A little little Cybertruck, a little mini vehicle drive out of the back.
[01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:23.440]   That's right.
[01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:26.480]   You'll be the jerk in the campsite, but you'll feel really good about this.
[01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:28.200]   Nobody will mess with you.
[01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:29.200]   Even those bears.
[01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:30.800]   Bears go on a stairway of that kind.
[01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:31.800]   He's looks like a dog.
[01:30:31.800 --> 01:30:34.160]   You'll look good as the most hated person at Burning Man.
[01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:35.400]   I don't have one of those.
[01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:38.200]   Oh, if you drove that at Burning Man, you'd be a star.
[01:30:38.200 --> 01:30:39.800]   No, no, people would love.
[01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:41.800]   That's exactly the crowd.
[01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:43.480]   That's the crowd right there.
[01:30:43.480 --> 01:30:44.480]   Let's take a little break.
[01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:45.480]   Great panel.
[01:30:45.480 --> 01:30:49.640]   I'm going to have Alex Cantor-Wits on bigtech.substack.com.
[01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:52.500]   He also does a big tech podcast.
[01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:55.600]   That's why he's got the big fancy microphone.
[01:30:55.600 --> 01:30:56.600]   That's great.
[01:30:56.600 --> 01:30:58.000]   Great to have you, Alex.
[01:30:58.000 --> 01:30:59.640]   It's great to be here.
[01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:01.800]   It's called big technology podcast, by the way.
[01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:03.320]   Just if you search it for it.
[01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:04.320]   Big technology podcast.
[01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:05.320]   Nice.
[01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:06.320]   Easy to find.
[01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:07.320]   Thanks for the shout out.
[01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:08.320]   Not big tech.
[01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:09.880]   Is that throwing it if I say big tech?
[01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:12.560]   There is a big tech podcast there on Mortal Kombat.
[01:31:12.560 --> 01:31:15.120]   So we have all the big tech.
[01:31:15.120 --> 01:31:19.360]   We have all of our listeners go to big tech podcast, give them one star reviews.
[01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:20.360]   No, I'm not.
[01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:21.360]   Big technology podcast.
[01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:24.760]   No, I can take care of that for you.
[01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:25.760]   Yeah, let's see.
[01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:27.760]   We have the special vision of Vatican.
[01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:28.760]   Oh, my God.
[01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:29.760]   Good.
[01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:32.080]   Actually, the guy I'm hoping to meet.
[01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:37.800]   Father Robert Ballis here, the digital Jesuit on-leaf, just temporarily from the Vatican to
[01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:38.800]   join us in studios.
[01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:39.800]   Really good to have you.
[01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:40.800]   It's nice to be home.
[01:31:40.800 --> 01:31:45.080]   It is also running the Vatican's own Minecraft server.
[01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:46.440]   Still going strong.
[01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:48.080]   And now you have factorial.
[01:31:48.080 --> 01:31:52.120]   Factorial and TF2 and Velheim.
[01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:54.120]   I've got to combine to play the game.
[01:31:54.120 --> 01:31:55.680]   You need to show me how to play that game.
[01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:58.040]   I tried playing it for five minutes and I just kept dying.
[01:31:58.040 --> 01:31:59.400]   Oh, yeah, that's part of the fun.
[01:31:59.400 --> 01:32:00.400]   Oh, no, it's not.
[01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:03.760]   I did a stream the other night because I'm a, you know, on the Twitch streamer.
[01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:06.520]   Of course, of course.
[01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:08.960]   And Twitch.tv/clubtwit.
[01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:13.960]   And it was, I was going to take on the boss, the fourth boss, who turns out to be tough.
[01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:14.960]   I was a little sanguine.
[01:32:14.960 --> 01:32:17.680]   I told Lisa, you know, it was six weeks.
[01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:18.680]   She just had dinner.
[01:32:18.680 --> 01:32:19.840]   I said, she said, I want to go for a walk.
[01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:20.920]   I said, give me an hour.
[01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:22.400]   I'll be back in an hour.
[01:32:22.400 --> 01:32:23.800]   And the sun was coming up.
[01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:26.640]   I'm going to beat motor and we can go for a walk.
[01:32:26.640 --> 01:32:27.640]   She's sitting there.
[01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:28.640]   She says, I don't think we're going for a walk.
[01:32:28.640 --> 01:32:30.240]   It's about 11.30 at night.
[01:32:30.240 --> 01:32:33.640]   I died and it was kind of humiliating because I'm on the stream.
[01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:34.640]   Yeah.
[01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:38.440]   Like every five seconds like clockwork, I must have died 20 or 30 times.
[01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:41.560]   I don't normally care about dying in video games, but there's something about Valheim
[01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:42.560]   that it hurts.
[01:32:42.560 --> 01:32:48.040]   It's actually the least disturbing because you don't lose anything except skill points.
[01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:49.040]   But it's annoying.
[01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:50.040]   It's just annoying.
[01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:54.360]   You have to go back home and then run naked back to your body and recover all your stuff
[01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:58.640]   and hope you don't get killed again anyway.
[01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:00.840]   Which is your favorite of those that you play on?
[01:33:00.840 --> 01:33:01.840]   It was factorial.
[01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:02.840]   No.
[01:33:02.840 --> 01:33:04.000]   So oxygen not included.
[01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:05.480]   I still play Rust.
[01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:06.480]   Rust is cool too.
[01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:07.480]   I do enjoy that.
[01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:09.680]   Actually, Rust has a Valheim feel.
[01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:11.960]   It's a very survivalist.
[01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:16.960]   But no, for just a fun game to have running in the background, it's oxygen not included.
[01:33:16.960 --> 01:33:19.440]   How many hours in are you on?
[01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:20.440]   Couple?
[01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:21.440]   3,094.
[01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:22.440]   That's 2,094.
[01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:25.440]   That's a lot of hours.
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:26.440]   Yeah.
[01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:27.440]   Right?
[01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:28.440]   That's too many hours.
[01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:30.440]   Do you get Bitcoin or something?
[01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:31.440]   I mean, what's the deal?
[01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:32.440]   I wish.
[01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:35.000]   I probably could have minds of Bitcoin with all those cycles.
[01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.080]   People want to get into the servers.
[01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:38.080]   How do they do that?
[01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:44.400]   There's these ways just to go to, if you go to my Twitter feed at twitter.com/padreastj.
[01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:46.080]   There's instructions to get on our Discord.
[01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:50.000]   So all of our gaming servers are tied to our Discord server.
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:54.240]   So once you join there, and I think we've got 9,000 members right now, you will automatically
[01:33:54.240 --> 01:33:56.840]   be able to enter into the gaming servers.
[01:33:56.840 --> 01:33:57.840]   Wow.
[01:33:57.840 --> 01:34:01.480]   I thought I was in your Discord server and I see I must have exited.
[01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:02.480]   Oh, well, I'll have to.
[01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:03.480]   No, I mean, I got in.
[01:34:03.480 --> 01:34:06.920]   I just, I must have, I have so many servers now.
[01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:07.920]   I know.
[01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:08.920]   I know.
[01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:09.920]   So I will.
[01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:10.920]   I'll post the link again.
[01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:11.920]   I'll go back in.
[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:12.920]   Yeah.
[01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:13.920]   No, I have a membership.
[01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:14.920]   So I should just be able to click a link, right?
[01:34:14.920 --> 01:34:15.920]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:16.920]   Yeah.
[01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:17.920]   I will do that.
[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:22.520]   It's also great to have you, Nicholas de Leon, who is, of course, the senior reporter at
[01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:24.880]   Consumer Reports writes about technology.
[01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:26.680]   There does a great job.
[01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:28.400]   You have a very fancy chair.
[01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:29.600]   What is that chair?
[01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:35.760]   Secret Lab, it is the semi-official chair of all PC gaming nerds out there, including
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:36.760]   myself.
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:37.760]   It's very good.
[01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:38.760]   It's very fancy.
[01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:43.120]   I got, I mean, I was working from home all the last year, so I was like, I kind of need
[01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:45.480]   a comfortable chair.
[01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:46.480]   So that's them.
[01:34:46.480 --> 01:34:48.600]   But, you know, yes, that's the.
[01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:49.600]   Do you have the.
[01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:51.680]   How are the Omega?
[01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:52.680]   I have the Omega.
[01:34:52.680 --> 01:34:57.400]   Although if folks are asking, I would recommend the Titan because it is a little bit more
[01:34:57.400 --> 01:34:59.520]   robust, the lumbar adjustment.
[01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:03.840]   This kind of just has a pillow, which I didn't realize when I purchased it, but it works
[01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:04.840]   just fine.
[01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:09.560]   But yeah, they're big, big, fun gaming chairs for the gamer.
[01:35:09.560 --> 01:35:11.800]   It sounds like you guys play games.
[01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:14.320]   Yeah, I might need a special chair.
[01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:16.320]   I'm just sitting in an office chair right now.
[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:17.320]   That's ridiculous.
[01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:19.000]   Actually, we bought Michael.
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:22.400]   He had a, I think, a razor gaming chair.
[01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:23.600]   And it really was crappy.
[01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:24.920]   So I just got on the course here.
[01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:29.160]   But now that I know about this, I might have, I might regret it.
[01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:34.360]   And by the way, note, they recommend with the sizes, they include not just height, but
[01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:35.360]   weight.
[01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:40.480]   So you buy the chair by the amount of weight that you're going to put in there.
[01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:44.040]   And if you're up to 390 pounds, you're going to want that Titan XL.
[01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:47.720]   That's the, that's the chair for the serious gamer.
[01:35:47.720 --> 01:35:54.320]   You know, how we got to do it in a secret lab, I had, but the gaming chair that I use
[01:35:54.320 --> 01:35:57.480]   in Rome is about 400 years old.
[01:35:57.480 --> 01:35:59.040]   A throne.
[01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:02.200]   It was the only chair that I could find to move up to my little studio.
[01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:05.200]   And does it look fancy at least?
[01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:06.640]   It looks old.
[01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:08.880]   I don't, I don't have any gauge for that.
[01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:09.880]   It's made of wood.
[01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:10.920]   It's definitely wood.
[01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:13.280]   It's definitely padding of any kind.
[01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:16.120]   When I put the pillow on top of it.
[01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:18.760]   But we don't do swivel chairs or gaming chairs.
[01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:23.280]   It's, if you, if you don't ache from the back, not enough suffering.
[01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:24.280]   Yeah.
[01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:25.280]   So it's not enough suffering.
[01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:26.280]   Why are you doing it?
[01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:27.280]   Yeah.
[01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:28.280]   Wow.
[01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:29.280]   That's hysterical.
[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:30.280]   So you can't swivel or anything?
[01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:32.800]   You can, but you, you carved gouges in the floor.
[01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:37.520]   So also, the Holy Father is still looking for that chair, by the way.
[01:36:37.520 --> 01:36:43.640]   The chairs from that era were not designed for people of my weight.
[01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:45.480]   I may have had to reinforce that.
[01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:47.000]   Oh, no.
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.680]   But technically I have a 3D printer so I could make little hinges.
[01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:52.520]   I think you should have used iron and leather.
[01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:53.520]   It probably wouldn't help.
[01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:55.720]   Would have, would have looked good.
[01:36:55.720 --> 01:36:57.960]   Great to have all three of you, thank you for joining us.
[01:36:57.960 --> 01:37:01.520]   And Nicholas, you have a podcast you want to plug or anything like that?
[01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:05.320]   Well, I mean, consumer reports, I would just say, you know, subscribe.
[01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:06.320]   That org, subscribe.
[01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:08.240]   Why aren't you a subscriber?
[01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:10.680]   It's the question everybody should subscribe.
[01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:11.680]   It's, it's funny.
[01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:14.800]   There was a lot of stories going on with like fake reviews on Amazon over the past week
[01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:15.800]   or so.
[01:37:15.800 --> 01:37:16.800]   Yeah.
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:17.800]   And I was kind of semi-joking.
[01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:20.720]   You know what place doesn't have problem with fake reviews because we buy everything.
[01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:23.400]   We test everything ourselves.
[01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:27.080]   Reading some of the reviews on Amazon, it's like, I don't know that I would rely on some
[01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:28.080]   of that stuff anymore.
[01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:30.880]   It's just every, every product is amazing.
[01:37:30.880 --> 01:37:31.880]   Five stars.
[01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:33.480]   I'm like, that's a little suspicious.
[01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:34.960]   Everything's awesome.
[01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:38.040]   So yeah, just search to reports.
[01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:39.800]   It's, you know, it's a nice place.
[01:37:39.800 --> 01:37:41.600]   I've been very proud to be there.
[01:37:41.600 --> 01:37:42.600]   Yeah.
[01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:47.600]   I'm, I think for 20, maybe 30 years, I'm always, I think it's the greatest thing.
[01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:51.640]   I mean, I used to get the magazine in the mail and now just do the online thing.
[01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:52.640]   Yeah.
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:56.280]   I got, I, my parents got it when I was a kid and had the red dots.
[01:37:56.280 --> 01:37:57.280]   Yeah.
[01:37:57.280 --> 01:38:01.640]   And obviously, you know, when I'm 10, I don't think that'll work for that place one day.
[01:38:01.640 --> 01:38:06.280]   But yeah, we're, we're, you know, we've been around for almost a hundred years, a nonprofit.
[01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:11.920]   We buy everything ourselves so that the manufacturers don't send us like a juiced unit or whatever
[01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:12.920]   to juice the numbers.
[01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:13.920]   That's the right way to do it.
[01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:14.920]   You go to the actual store.
[01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:15.920]   Yeah.
[01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:16.920]   Yeah.
[01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:20.840]   It's a really special place and I'm, I'm really proud to be there.
[01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:26.040]   For the zoomers in our audience, consumer reports, it's like Yelp and Google all wrapped
[01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:27.880]   up in one, but it gets delivered to you.
[01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:28.880]   It's the original.
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:29.880]   We've got a TikTok account.
[01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:30.880]   Do you really?
[01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:31.960]   Oh, I want to follow that.
[01:38:31.960 --> 01:38:32.960]   That's awesome.
[01:38:32.960 --> 01:38:36.480]   I don't, but consumer reports.
[01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:42.280]   I, I told my wife once that I bought my shampoo based on the consumer report recommendation.
[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:45.520]   She said, why would you follow their recommendations?
[01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:49.920]   Those guys watched their hair was soap and I said, yeah, you're probably right.
[01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:56.640]   But one, one little story, a few weeks back, I was in a meeting and there were some people
[01:38:56.640 --> 01:38:59.120]   there who were saying, well, we're on social.
[01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:00.120]   How come we're not in TikTok?
[01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:01.120]   We should be on TikTok.
[01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:02.120]   I said, really?
[01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:06.600]   And so I started showing to TikTok videos and after about five minutes, I said, now we
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:07.840]   don't need to be on TikTok.
[01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:10.080]   It's a generational thing.
[01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:11.080]   It is generational.
[01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:12.720]   There's, there's many different TikToks.
[01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:14.040]   It's all about what the algorithm is.
[01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:15.840]   There's inspiration stuff.
[01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:17.160]   You know, I, it's great.
[01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:21.240]   Have you seen my son's TikTok salt hank?
[01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:22.240]   Look at this.
[01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:24.760]   He's going to make up a motto toast that you have ever had.
[01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:26.560]   Hey, he's got a really popular account.
[01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:27.560]   Oh, yeah, he's very popular.
[01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:28.560]   That's awesome.
[01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:31.240]   He's, he's going places this kid.
[01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:32.800]   They think this is great.
[01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:34.000]   His career goal is to be.
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:37.480]   Oh, this is far better than doing jousting with hoverboards.
[01:39:37.480 --> 01:39:39.960]   He's gone, he's gone well beyond that.
[01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:40.960]   Watch this.
[01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:42.960]   Oh, that's actually well done.
[01:39:42.960 --> 01:39:43.960]   Yeah.
[01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:47.400]   I said, how come you don't ever make this at home?
[01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:48.400]   Mm.
[01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:49.400]   Okay.
[01:39:49.400 --> 01:39:53.120]   So if I did this for the Vatican, it would just be really poorly made eggs.
[01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:54.120]   Hard, hard eggs.
[01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:55.120]   Yeah.
[01:39:55.120 --> 01:39:56.120]   Yeah.
[01:39:56.120 --> 01:39:57.120]   He's a, he's quite a cook.
[01:39:57.120 --> 01:39:58.120]   I think he's most.
[01:39:58.120 --> 01:39:59.120]   I had to delete.
[01:39:59.120 --> 01:40:00.120]   Go ahead and TikTok.
[01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:03.800]   Yeah, I did too because it's too addictive.
[01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:08.440]   I, they even have a guy who comes on after you are on it for more than an hour who says,
[01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:09.920]   get some water, take a break.
[01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:11.640]   I just used the YouTube TikTok.
[01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:14.960]   Which is actually just TikTok videos that someone has uploaded to YouTube.
[01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:15.960]   That's probably good.
[01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:16.960]   You can actually see the TikTok logo.
[01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:17.960]   That's probably good.
[01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:18.960]   That's better.
[01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:23.480]   But yeah, there've been, there've been times where I just like, all right, just fall into
[01:40:23.480 --> 01:40:24.560]   these TikTok holes.
[01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:25.560]   Exactly.
[01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:27.800]   And I know it's a couple hours later.
[01:40:27.800 --> 01:40:29.840]   That's why it took it off the phone.
[01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:30.840]   It's not healthy.
[01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:32.360]   It was fine when I couldn't leave the apartment.
[01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:33.360]   Right.
[01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:35.600]   Now I can, TikTok went, I don't miss it.
[01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:39.880]   Actually maybe that's what it is is these are, these were COVID habits that we can now.
[01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:40.880]   They're coping.
[01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:43.320]   You were helping us cope because we couldn't do anything else.
[01:40:43.320 --> 01:40:44.760]   And now we're getting back to work.
[01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:45.760]   Oh God.
[01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:46.760]   Wait, I don't.
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:47.760]   Give me TikTok.
[01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:50.560]   The sad thing is my work is pretty much the same as I was during the pandemic.
[01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:52.400]   I'm still living in a huge house.
[01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:53.400]   Yeah.
[01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:56.040]   In the middle of a city that I never leave because everything's in the house.
[01:40:56.040 --> 01:40:58.400]   You're not giving the last rights as often as you used to.
[01:40:58.400 --> 01:41:00.200]   No, that's a terrible joke.
[01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:01.200]   Oh, it's true though.
[01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:02.200]   It's very true.
[01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:03.200]   Did you have to?
[01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:04.200]   Where's there were a lot of deaths?
[01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:05.200]   Oh, I'm so sorry.
[01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:07.680]   I shouldn't joke about that.
[01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:12.240]   By the last count, I think it's about 400, 400 Jesuits.
[01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:13.240]   From your house?
[01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:14.240]   No, just from around the world.
[01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:15.240]   Oh, around the world.
[01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:16.240]   In my house, we lost three.
[01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:17.240]   Yeah, that's sad.
[01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:18.240]   That's really sad.
[01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:22.600]   But I mean, 600,000 in the US, we brought that in the US, Terry.
[01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:24.000]   All right, but we're getting there.
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:25.000]   We're getting better.
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.280]   We got people in the studio.
[01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:30.200]   We, you know, I said we survived it.
[01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:31.200]   We made it.
[01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:33.680]   Well, up to now, I mean, it's not over.
[01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:34.680]   It's not over.
[01:41:34.680 --> 01:41:35.680]   The Delta variant.
[01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:40.240]   It got into Rome right before I left and it's bad.
[01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:42.280]   It's really, really bad.
[01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:46.040]   It's one of the, we actually lost one guy to it and he was fine in the morning and he
[01:41:46.040 --> 01:41:47.040]   was dead by you.
[01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:48.040]   Oh my God.
[01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:49.040]   And he was what?
[01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:50.040]   47.
[01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:51.040]   Are you sure?
[01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:52.040]   Have you, did you have a test?
[01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:53.040]   Are you, I have tested it?
[01:41:53.040 --> 01:41:55.880]   I remember I had to be tested before I got on the plane.
[01:41:55.880 --> 01:41:56.880]   I was at the airport.
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:41:57.880]   I was at the next to you now.
[01:41:57.880 --> 01:42:00.240]   And then tested when I landed.
[01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:03.200]   Alex, I'd move if I were you.
[01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:05.640]   I showed that I just went to a peer density today.
[01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:07.720]   Yes, that's probably good thinking.
[01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:09.920]   I showed it.
[01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:12.560]   Brought to you by Udacity.
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:13.560]   I love Udacity.
[01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:16.840]   I joined in 2012, taking many courses there.
[01:42:16.840 --> 01:42:19.480]   I had to think that blew me away back in 2012.
[01:42:19.480 --> 01:42:25.000]   It was started by a Googler who realized that honestly people weren't getting the education
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:29.960]   they needed to get those great jobs at the big tech companies.
[01:42:29.960 --> 01:42:34.560]   So they created the nano degrees first with Google, but now with Microsoft and IBM and
[01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:40.400]   Amazon too, these nano degrees give you the skills that you need to get a great job
[01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:43.720]   in technology in really areas.
[01:42:43.720 --> 01:42:45.480]   In some cases you can't get anywhere else.
[01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:46.960]   AI, deep learning.
[01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:51.320]   They've got a flying car and autonomous flight engineer course.
[01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:57.440]   They've got intro to self-driving cars, machine learning engineer, robotics software engineer.
[01:42:57.440 --> 01:43:02.240]   To create this course content Udacity partners with industry leaders, Microsoft, Google,
[01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:06.320]   IBM, Amazon, select team leads at top companies to be instructors.
[01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:10.600]   So you're learning from people who really use this and know this stuff.
[01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:13.240]   Not somebody who learned it 10 years ago and is still teaching it.
[01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:18.640]   If you love learning and you're always looking to know more tech stuff, Udacity is for you.
[01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:22.680]   If you want a better job, if you want to get in the tech industry, this is the way to
[01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:23.680]   do it.
[01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:27.280]   Udacity can help you master the latest tech skills and techniques.
[01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:30.480]   What I love about it is of course you've got the videos you can watch for these great
[01:43:30.480 --> 01:43:34.760]   instructors, but every Udacity course is project based.
[01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:35.840]   It's active learning.
[01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:38.640]   They want you to get hands on with these technologies.
[01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:39.840]   That's so important.
[01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:41.560]   It's one thing to learn it.
[01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:44.400]   It's another thing to actually implement it.
[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:46.200]   There's NVIDIA and Twitter too.
[01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:50.480]   That's another couple of companies that create courses for Udacity.
[01:43:50.480 --> 01:43:51.960]   Cutting edge technology.
[01:43:51.960 --> 01:43:53.640]   You'll do these projects.
[01:43:53.640 --> 01:43:57.040]   Your homework and projects are reviewed by qualified professionals.
[01:43:57.040 --> 01:43:58.040]   But don't worry.
[01:43:58.040 --> 01:43:59.280]   You're not going it alone.
[01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:04.320]   You'll have human feedback and reviews, but also access to mentors 24/7.
[01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:10.040]   You really, it is a team working with you to get your skills up to snuff.
[01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:12.400]   You can do it in your spare time.
[01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:15.040]   Put in as little as five to ten hours a week.
[01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:20.320]   Any time of the day or night, they know many of you have day jobs, but want a better job.
[01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:22.680]   You can graduate in as little as three months.
[01:44:22.680 --> 01:44:26.320]   This is the depressing stat from the World Economic Forum.
[01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:33.640]   75 million jobs today will be replaced in the next three years by automated processes.
[01:44:33.640 --> 01:44:34.640]   75 million.
[01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:40.200]   That's why a lot of people are going to Udacity to get ready for the jobs of the future.
[01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:45.760]   14 million people use Udacity in over 240 countries.
[01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:46.760]   Do me a favor.
[01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:47.960]   Just look at Udacity.com.

[01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:20.720]   You might want to take one of those just to get a sense of what Udacity could do.
[01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:24.720]   There's courses in polishing, your GitHub profile, your resume on LinkedIn.
[01:45:24.720 --> 01:45:28.480]   In marketing, networking, all of that kind of stuff.
[01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:33.600]   If you're a business and you want to get your team up to snuff and cutting edge technologies

[01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:08.880]   You've only got about 10 more days.
[01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:11.840]   The offer expires June 30, 2021.
[01:46:11.840 --> 01:46:14.560]   Udacity.com/Twit.
[01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:18.680]   Thank you, Udacity, for supporting this week in tech.
[01:46:18.680 --> 01:46:23.400]   And thank you, dear listener, for supporting us by using that special address, Udacity.com.
[01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:28.400]   And the offer code "Twit75".
[01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:33.200]   Let's see, what else?
[01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:35.560]   Oh, this was actually a shocker to me.
[01:46:35.560 --> 01:46:41.280]   I didn't realize data centers use so much water.
[01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:51.000]   The City Council of Mesa, Arizona proved a giant data center for Apple in Mesa, Arizona.
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:59.320]   The data center uses 1.25 million gallons of water every day.
[01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:01.160]   Much of the country is going through a drought.
[01:47:01.160 --> 01:47:07.240]   We're going to a serious drought here in California.
[01:47:07.240 --> 01:47:13.680]   Some of the City Council is saying, "Hold on there, 1.25 million gallons of water."
[01:47:13.680 --> 01:47:16.120]   And it doesn't benefit Mesa particularly.
[01:47:16.120 --> 01:47:21.200]   There are 1,800 data centers all over the country.
[01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:24.440]   Many of them are using a huge amount of water.
[01:47:24.440 --> 01:47:29.080]   Virginia Tech estimates 1/5 of data centers draw water from moderate to highly stressed
[01:47:29.080 --> 01:47:34.920]   watersheds, mostly out here in the West.
[01:47:34.920 --> 01:47:42.840]   There's a cost to that Google search, to that iCloud storage, that it goes beyond the couple
[01:47:42.840 --> 01:47:43.840]   of bucks a month.
[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:45.840]   You're paying for it.
[01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:49.680]   Building a global data center infrastructure will reach $200 billion a year according to
[01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:50.960]   Gartner.
[01:47:50.960 --> 01:47:52.560]   That's up 6%.
[01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:56.560]   And then should go up 3% to 4% annually over the next three years.
[01:47:56.560 --> 01:47:59.960]   At the same time as drought goes crazy.
[01:47:59.960 --> 01:48:05.080]   The typical data center actually uses 3 to 5 million gallons of water.
[01:48:05.080 --> 01:48:07.320]   That's the same amount of water.
[01:48:07.320 --> 01:48:11.920]   Same amount of water is a city of 30 to 50,000 people.
[01:48:11.920 --> 01:48:12.920]   Holy cow.
[01:48:12.920 --> 01:48:13.920]   I don't have to do it.
[01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:18.520]   The other way is to make it way more expensive to run because we're talking about hyperscale
[01:48:18.520 --> 01:48:19.520]   data centers.
[01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:23.880]   And hyperscale data centers have such a high density that you need maximum amount of coolings
[01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:24.880]   for coolings.
[01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:25.880]   Right.
[01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:27.280]   Did Google look at putting them underwater?
[01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:28.800]   I mean, there were companies building these.
[01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:33.240]   Yeah, Google, Microsoft, either locating them underwater or putting them in areas of the
[01:48:33.240 --> 01:48:37.360]   world where natural cooling can be taken advantage of.
[01:48:37.360 --> 01:48:42.400]   But if you drop a data center in the middle of Arizona, there ain't no cool place.
[01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:46.440]   And the evaporative coolers use up a ton of water.
[01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:47.440]   Where does the water go?
[01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:48.440]   In the air?
[01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:49.440]   It goes in the air.
[01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:53.440]   Because you've got these huge towers that are running like cascading waterfalls of water.
[01:48:53.440 --> 01:48:57.040]   And as it evaporates, it cools and you can pipe it back into the data center.
[01:48:57.040 --> 01:49:02.600]   You could do traditional closed loop cooling, but that's on an order of 10x to 20x more
[01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:05.560]   expensive because it's way more energy intensive.
[01:49:05.560 --> 01:49:09.120]   It's cheaper for them just to let the water evaporate.
[01:49:09.120 --> 01:49:10.600]   It's depressing.
[01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:11.600]   Yeah.
[01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:13.480]   I don't know if that's even tenable.
[01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:14.480]   I don't know if you can.
[01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:15.480]   It's not.
[01:49:15.480 --> 01:49:16.480]   Yeah.
[01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:17.480]   That's absolutely.
[01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:18.480]   I mean, that water...
[01:49:18.480 --> 01:49:19.480]   We talk about farms.
[01:49:19.480 --> 01:49:20.480]   Because farms.
[01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:21.480]   Farms requiring a lot of water.
[01:49:21.480 --> 01:49:25.320]   But it's the fraction of that and we need the almonds.
[01:49:25.320 --> 01:49:26.320]   But...
[01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:27.320]   Wow.
[01:49:27.320 --> 01:49:28.320]   Wow.
[01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:29.320]   That's terrifying.
[01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:30.320]   We're really...
[01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:31.920]   Things are very dry here right now.
[01:49:31.920 --> 01:49:35.880]   I remember I had a conversation with Greenpeace maybe two years ago about some of the stuff
[01:49:35.880 --> 01:49:39.920]   and data center use and how energy efficient.
[01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:40.920]   That feels like a...
[01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:43.520]   That's probably wouldn't be my beat necessarily.
[01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:47.600]   But it feels like that's a topic that we should be talking about a little bit more because
[01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:48.600]   I don't know that...
[01:49:48.600 --> 01:49:53.080]   I see a lot of a Bitcoin energy and it being bad and maybe it is, I don't know.
[01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:54.440]   But like this data...
[01:49:54.440 --> 01:49:56.640]   That doesn't sound tenable.
[01:49:56.640 --> 01:49:57.640]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:49:57.640 --> 01:50:01.400]   Bitcoin is easy to identify and attack because it's something that a lot of people don't
[01:50:01.400 --> 01:50:02.400]   use.
[01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:03.960]   And so therefore it's the bad guy.
[01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:05.680]   And yes, it is super inefficient.
[01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:07.040]   It uses up a lot of energy.
[01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:11.480]   Then the energy is essentially the capital that you're putting into the system.
[01:50:11.480 --> 01:50:18.240]   But for you to have always on access to everything that you want requires all these data centers
[01:50:18.240 --> 01:50:23.160]   to be spun up at all times of the day, requires all the massive amounts of infrastructure to
[01:50:23.160 --> 01:50:24.520]   be connected to each other.
[01:50:24.520 --> 01:50:26.120]   So you're participating.
[01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:30.520]   Everyone's participating in these hyperscale data centers because that's why these things
[01:50:30.520 --> 01:50:31.520]   work.
[01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:38.040]   We were talking, you were showing that you've got some new anchor, GAN chargers.
[01:50:38.040 --> 01:50:39.040]   And we were talking about it.
[01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:45.600]   I saw that a number of companies, particularly RavPower and Aussie, have been removed from
[01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:49.720]   Amazon for soliciting reviews.
[01:50:49.720 --> 01:50:51.600]   And I was a little bit shocked.
[01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:58.720]   Apparently, Amazon just recently yanked RavPower, Vava and Taotronics.
[01:50:58.720 --> 01:51:04.640]   They're all share a parent company, a Chinese company.
[01:51:04.640 --> 01:51:14.600]   And I think it all started with a Wall Street Journal report showing that the reporter, Nicole
[01:51:14.600 --> 01:51:22.680]   Nguyen, when she bought a new charger from RavPower, got a coupon in there offering $35
[01:51:22.680 --> 01:51:25.720]   in gift card for Amazon review.
[01:51:25.720 --> 01:51:26.720]   That's pretty good.
[01:51:26.720 --> 01:51:28.400]   Yeah, it's good money.
[01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:32.800]   It's also against Amazon's rules and has been for five years.
[01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:35.640]   So apparently that was the...
[01:51:35.640 --> 01:51:36.640]   Now I like RavPower.
[01:51:36.640 --> 01:51:37.640]   I buy their batteries.
[01:51:37.640 --> 01:51:39.120]   Their products are actually pretty good.
[01:51:39.120 --> 01:51:41.440]   Yeah, they're chargers.
[01:51:41.440 --> 01:51:48.840]   My charge, RavPower, they actually made decent product, but they felt as if they didn't stack
[01:51:48.840 --> 01:51:54.480]   their reviews, they don't get to the top of Amazon search and therefore they lose out.
[01:51:54.480 --> 01:51:56.120]   So it was a calculated bet and they lost.
[01:51:56.120 --> 01:51:57.200]   Yeah, they lost.
[01:51:57.200 --> 01:51:58.960]   And I think I understand...
[01:51:58.960 --> 01:52:03.360]   You were talking to Nicholas about the problem Amazon's having with phony reviews.
[01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:07.800]   They're blaming social media.
[01:52:07.800 --> 01:52:10.560]   How many reviews on Amazon do you think are fake?
[01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:14.000]   Because I honestly, I don't buy something unless I read the reviews first.
[01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:15.000]   I've been solicited.
[01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:16.000]   That's really?
[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:17.000]   Yeah, a lot.
[01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:22.280]   That's the real value of Amazon for me, is those reviews.
[01:52:22.280 --> 01:52:24.520]   I couldn't even estimate how many of them are.
[01:52:24.520 --> 01:52:27.080]   But I do personally, if it's not something that...
[01:52:27.080 --> 01:52:32.640]   Let's say headphones or whatever, I'll often Google blah, blah, blah, Reddit and to find
[01:52:32.640 --> 01:52:35.760]   the people talking about saying that I know.
[01:52:35.760 --> 01:52:40.240]   I'm currently shopping around for some home theater stuff.
[01:52:40.240 --> 01:52:44.760]   And so I'm typing all the models and Reddit and seeing people talk about them and actual
[01:52:44.760 --> 01:52:50.760]   humans, at least Reddit to my knowledge, hasn't been gamified or subverted in that way.
[01:52:50.760 --> 01:52:53.840]   How if they're phony?
[01:52:53.840 --> 01:52:54.840]   Not if they're written well.
[01:52:54.840 --> 01:52:57.080]   Yeah, but harmony are written well.
[01:52:57.080 --> 01:52:58.080]   No, okay.
[01:52:58.080 --> 01:53:01.720]   So a lot of the spam ones, yeah, just discarded those.
[01:53:01.720 --> 01:53:04.880]   But if someone's actually going into detail about what they used it for...
[01:53:04.880 --> 01:53:06.880]   Well, that's the problem with this gift card thing.
[01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:12.880]   That may actually solicit somebody who really cares to write that review.
[01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:20.760]   Everyone says it removed more than 200 million suspected fake reviews in 2020 alone before
[01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:23.160]   they were seen by customers.
[01:53:23.160 --> 01:53:25.600]   So that's a huge number.
[01:53:25.600 --> 01:53:30.520]   Now something interesting I find about this story is a while back, probably about six
[01:53:30.520 --> 01:53:36.560]   or seven months ago, I was solicited for a set of reviews for products that I had only
[01:53:36.560 --> 01:53:37.560]   searched for on Amazon.
[01:53:37.560 --> 01:53:40.560]   For the reason I thought you were going to set a set of steak knives.
[01:53:40.560 --> 01:53:41.560]   Oh, okay.
[01:53:41.560 --> 01:53:44.960]   No, so these were products I had only looked for on Amazon.
[01:53:44.960 --> 01:53:45.960]   I hadn't googled for them.
[01:53:45.960 --> 01:53:47.200]   I just thought, oh, those are interesting.
[01:53:47.200 --> 01:53:49.040]   And then like the next day, I got...
[01:53:49.040 --> 01:53:50.040]   They knew that you'd seen that.
[01:53:50.040 --> 01:53:51.040]   Right.
[01:53:51.040 --> 01:53:52.040]   I'm like, so is Amazon selling that data?
[01:53:52.040 --> 01:53:53.040]   They must be.
[01:53:53.040 --> 01:53:54.760]   That's the only way that they could have gotten it.
[01:53:54.760 --> 01:53:55.760]   They must be.
[01:53:55.760 --> 01:54:00.560]   They were the by a list of people who looked at their product but didn't buy.
[01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:04.760]   And suddenly they said, hey, we'd love to give you a free X, Y or Z.
[01:54:04.760 --> 01:54:06.960]   All we would ask is you write a review.
[01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:11.040]   I find it hard to believe that Amazon is selling that first party data to people.
[01:54:11.040 --> 01:54:12.040]   I mean, that's the secret sauce.
[01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:14.040]   Well, how would they get that?
[01:54:14.040 --> 01:54:15.040]   There's no way.
[01:54:15.040 --> 01:54:16.040]   Well, that's what I thought.
[01:54:16.040 --> 01:54:18.360]   I'm like, no, no way Amazon would risk that.
[01:54:18.360 --> 01:54:21.680]   But then how in the world did they get that?
[01:54:21.680 --> 01:54:26.120]   It's the same story with the Facebook is listening to us on our device.
[01:54:26.120 --> 01:54:30.440]   That oftentimes, you know, we might think that our behaviors are the products we're
[01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:35.960]   interested in are, you know, very idiosyncratic or specific to ourselves.
[01:54:35.960 --> 01:54:40.440]   But once you can target someone with some broad targeting criteria, you could generally
[01:54:40.440 --> 01:54:42.760]   figure out what they like and what they want.
[01:54:42.760 --> 01:54:47.720]   And in fact, when I would speak to people who used to work in the front offices in Amazon,
[01:54:47.720 --> 01:54:50.720]   you know, they would tell me that they could tell you everything about the way that people
[01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:52.520]   live in a certain zip code.
[01:54:52.520 --> 01:54:53.520]   Absolutely.
[01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:54.520]   All they needed is a zip code.
[01:54:54.520 --> 01:54:55.520]   All they needed is a zip code.
[01:54:55.520 --> 01:54:57.520]   They're going on for decades.
[01:54:57.520 --> 01:54:58.520]   They know everything.
[01:54:58.520 --> 01:54:59.520]   Yeah.
[01:54:59.520 --> 01:55:05.000]   So it's not as if the, you know, they needed to necessarily search, you know, your search
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:08.120]   history on Amazon, which Amazon would never sell because that's what powers the whole
[01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:09.120]   marketplace.
[01:55:09.120 --> 01:55:10.120]   Right.
[01:55:10.120 --> 01:55:13.880]   And it would just be that they, they guessed pretty well, which is why the same thing that
[01:55:13.880 --> 01:55:15.960]   happens when people say you didn't click anything.
[01:55:15.960 --> 01:55:17.600]   You just opened that page.
[01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:19.640]   I just opened that the product went on.
[01:55:19.640 --> 01:55:22.480]   This one was so this was for a backpack, a solar powered backpack.
[01:55:22.480 --> 01:55:26.400]   So it's highly unlikely they would have said, Oh, that father Robert, he buys a lot of solar
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:27.400]   power backpacks.
[01:55:27.400 --> 01:55:28.400]   Right.
[01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:31.760]   So it was such a niche thing and it was so on different than anything I've ever served.
[01:55:31.760 --> 01:55:34.960]   And then the next day after looking at that listing, I got an offer.
[01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:36.400]   We'll send you a free one.
[01:55:36.400 --> 01:55:37.400]   All we want is a review.
[01:55:37.400 --> 01:55:38.400]   Quite a coincidence.
[01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:42.000]   The way they phrase it was interesting because they said we, we don't, we don't want to
[01:55:42.000 --> 01:55:43.240]   buy a positive review.
[01:55:43.240 --> 01:55:45.000]   We just want to make sure you share your experience.
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:46.800]   Amazon gets upset about that.
[01:55:46.800 --> 01:55:47.800]   Yeah.
[01:55:47.800 --> 01:55:51.960]   Amazon's blaming some malware installed on your computer where they're tracking your
[01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:53.200]   money on your computer.
[01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:54.440]   I mean, it's possible.
[01:55:54.440 --> 01:55:57.200]   Do you have a always possible to use the edge browser?
[01:55:57.200 --> 01:55:58.200]   I do.
[01:55:58.200 --> 01:56:01.560]   Do you have you noticed the edge browser?
[01:56:01.560 --> 01:56:06.560]   If you start to buy something, we'll fire up and give you a hundred coupons for that.
[01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:08.360]   Yeah, I think it's the edge browser.
[01:56:08.360 --> 01:56:10.600]   I have an Microsoft selling it.
[01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:11.600]   It's the weirdest thing.
[01:56:11.600 --> 01:56:12.600]   Is that only with the honey plug?
[01:56:12.600 --> 01:56:13.600]   Because I don't have it.
[01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:15.240]   No, no, no, it's built into edge.
[01:56:15.240 --> 01:56:16.960]   That's built into edge.
[01:56:16.960 --> 01:56:18.880]   I mean, I've been using edge for a while now.
[01:56:18.880 --> 01:56:20.600]   I've never gotten a coupon offer.
[01:56:20.600 --> 01:56:24.080]   Go to a Lenovo and so this is.
[01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:26.520]   Maybe we all have malware on our computer.
[01:56:26.520 --> 01:56:31.760]   No, no, this is a Microsoft Edge now has this is from the verge of November of last year.
[01:56:31.760 --> 01:56:34.960]   coupon and promo codes built in.
[01:56:34.960 --> 01:56:35.960]   You just did it.
[01:56:35.960 --> 01:56:38.280]   Oh, 2% cash back.
[01:56:38.280 --> 01:56:39.520]   It just did it.
[01:56:39.520 --> 01:56:40.520]   Lenovo.
[01:56:40.520 --> 01:56:41.520]   Oh, man.
[01:56:41.520 --> 01:56:42.520]   Now I have to dump it.
[01:56:42.520 --> 01:56:46.880]   Now, if you if you click a laptop and start to order it, it'll look for it in other sites.
[01:56:46.880 --> 01:56:48.600]   That is horrible.
[01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:50.400]   No, no, Microsoft.
[01:56:50.400 --> 01:56:52.840]   I was with you, but now we're done.
[01:56:52.840 --> 01:56:54.320]   It's built into edge.
[01:56:54.320 --> 01:56:55.840]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:56:55.840 --> 01:56:57.680]   We found 10 coupons.
[01:56:57.680 --> 01:57:00.360]   Microsoft Edge is trying available coupons.
[01:57:00.360 --> 01:57:02.560]   Summer 20 was applied to your cart.
[01:57:02.560 --> 01:57:03.560]   But you know what?
[01:57:03.560 --> 01:57:04.560]   They saved a lot of money.
[01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:06.680]   They saved me like $1,700 bucks on Lenovo.
[01:57:06.680 --> 01:57:08.440]   Well, Microsoft knows what what.
[01:57:08.440 --> 01:57:11.960]   But now they know they basically built honey into edge.
[01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:12.960]   That's not cool.
[01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:14.600]   That's so not cool.
[01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:15.600]   We now know that off.
[01:57:15.600 --> 01:57:17.840]   Is there a way to get rid of that?
[01:57:17.840 --> 01:57:20.760]   Why would you ever want to turn that off?
[01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:21.760]   Great.
[01:57:21.760 --> 01:57:25.120]   Now I'm sure there is a set off to do everything from the brave browser now.
[01:57:25.120 --> 01:57:26.120]   Yeah.
[01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:28.320]   No more edge for you.
[01:57:28.320 --> 01:57:32.000]   I like the edge because it is actually much faster than chrome.
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:33.000]   Chrome got so Joe.
[01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:34.760]   I don't, I won't use Chrome.
[01:57:34.760 --> 01:57:37.120]   I'm sorry, I'm just not going to use Chrome.
[01:57:37.120 --> 01:57:38.520]   She has a link sproutzer.
[01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:39.520]   Text only.
[01:57:39.520 --> 01:57:40.520]   Links baby text only.
[01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:42.320]   They can not intend it.
[01:57:42.320 --> 01:57:43.320]   I believe.
[01:57:43.320 --> 01:57:45.440]   So that's the zork of browsers.
[01:57:45.440 --> 01:57:46.440]   I like it.
[01:57:46.440 --> 01:57:53.240]   Actually, Tim Berners Lee is selling the source code for the World Wide Web as an NFT.
[01:57:53.240 --> 01:57:54.240]   Okay.
[01:57:54.240 --> 01:57:59.880]   I'm glad Tim TBL who invented the World Wide Web when he was a physicist at CERN at the
[01:57:59.880 --> 01:58:00.880]   Particle Research.
[01:58:00.880 --> 01:58:01.880]   He deserved something.
[01:58:01.880 --> 01:58:05.800]   He felt like physicists should be able to kind of comment on each other's papers and
[01:58:05.800 --> 01:58:08.680]   it should be able to have, you know, hyperlinks and stuff like that.
[01:58:08.680 --> 01:58:13.560]   And then at the World Wide Web on a next cube, he is, it's the first time according
[01:58:13.560 --> 01:58:15.280]   to NBC.
[01:58:15.280 --> 01:58:16.560]   So you got to trust them.
[01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:21.280]   The first time Tim Berners Lee has been able to capitalize financially on what is widely
[01:58:21.280 --> 01:58:23.440]   viewed as one of the greatest inventions of our time.
[01:58:23.440 --> 01:58:24.440]   Okay.
[01:58:24.440 --> 01:58:25.440]   I will, I want to reward him.
[01:58:25.440 --> 01:58:26.600]   He should, he should do well.
[01:58:26.600 --> 01:58:28.280]   Well, buy it for like a billion dollars.
[01:58:28.280 --> 01:58:31.720]   Well, if the funny thing is, south of B is auctioning it off June.
[01:58:31.720 --> 01:58:33.240]   23rd through 30th.
[01:58:33.240 --> 01:58:35.120]   The bidding starts at a thousand bucks.
[01:58:35.120 --> 01:58:38.880]   Look, if Nioncat can go for what was it?
[01:58:38.880 --> 01:58:40.800]   600 grand in Ethereum tokens.
[01:58:40.800 --> 01:58:43.080]   I think he can get a couple hundred.
[01:58:43.080 --> 01:58:44.080]   The NFT includes-
[01:58:44.080 --> 01:58:45.080]   He's going to make a-
[01:58:45.080 --> 01:58:46.080]   Sorry, go ahead.
[01:58:46.080 --> 01:58:47.080]   No, no, no, please.
[01:58:47.080 --> 01:58:50.960]   He's going to make a ton of money off of it, but I still don't really understand this
[01:58:50.960 --> 01:58:51.960]   whole NFT thing.
[01:58:51.960 --> 01:58:52.960]   No one does.
[01:58:52.960 --> 01:58:53.960]   That's okay.
[01:58:53.960 --> 01:58:54.960]   Don't worry about it.
[01:58:54.960 --> 01:58:57.720]   It's the TikTok of the crypto crowd.
[01:58:57.720 --> 01:58:58.720]   The NFT.
[01:58:58.720 --> 01:59:02.080]   I understand TikTok way more than I understand.
[01:59:02.080 --> 01:59:04.000]   And if these at least you can enjoy TikTok.
[01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:09.120]   Alex, did you ever buy a beanie baby hoping it was going to make more money when it was
[01:59:09.120 --> 01:59:12.760]   a year later or perhaps baseball cards?
[01:59:12.760 --> 01:59:15.760]   I don't deny buying physical collectibles.
[01:59:15.760 --> 01:59:16.760]   The digital collectibles.
[01:59:16.760 --> 01:59:23.160]   I don't get it because maybe I'm wrong about this, but can't you build multiple ownership
[01:59:23.160 --> 01:59:28.480]   tokens on a bunch of different blockchains and then end up having like this NFT and that
[01:59:28.480 --> 01:59:29.480]   NFT?
[01:59:29.480 --> 01:59:30.480]   Yes.
[01:59:30.480 --> 01:59:37.000]   So with the addition of Taproot to Bitcoin, it's now more amenable to smart contracts,
[01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:40.600]   which means you could technically build that on top of that.
[01:59:40.600 --> 01:59:41.600]   Okay.
[01:59:41.600 --> 01:59:42.600]   I guess-
[01:59:42.600 --> 01:59:52.680]   In fact, the provenance is kind of in a way that say a baseball card isn't is very provable,
[01:59:52.680 --> 01:59:53.680]   right?
[01:59:53.680 --> 01:59:54.680]   Yes.
[01:59:54.680 --> 01:59:59.720]   Some of the people who were earlier adopters of NFTs, early investors of NFTs have realized
[01:59:59.720 --> 02:00:04.000]   that you're not actually buying the asset, you're buying a pointer to the asset.
[02:00:04.000 --> 02:00:05.920]   Here is the auction listing.
[02:00:05.920 --> 02:00:06.920]   Yes.
[02:00:06.920 --> 02:00:07.920]   Yes.
[02:00:07.920 --> 02:00:08.920]   You're not- No, yeah.
[02:00:08.920 --> 02:00:09.920]   You don't own the source code.
[02:00:09.920 --> 02:00:14.600]   So if the asset where- if the hosting for the asset goes away, you can't access it anymore.
[02:00:14.600 --> 02:00:15.600]   Look at this.
[02:00:15.600 --> 02:00:16.600]   He's writing this.
[02:00:16.600 --> 02:00:17.600]   What is this?
[02:00:17.600 --> 02:00:18.600]   Objective C?
[02:00:18.600 --> 02:00:19.600]   This is what you're buying?
[02:00:19.600 --> 02:00:20.600]   Yeah.
[02:00:20.600 --> 02:00:21.600]   Okay.
[02:00:21.600 --> 02:00:22.600]   Yeah.
[02:00:22.600 --> 02:00:23.600]   Okay.
[02:00:23.600 --> 02:00:29.840]   Time-stamped files containing the source code written between October 3rd, 1990, and August
[02:00:29.840 --> 02:00:31.880]   24th, 1991.
[02:00:31.880 --> 02:00:35.720]   That's about 10,000 lines of code.
[02:00:35.720 --> 02:00:39.240]   You get this, an animated visualization of the code.
[02:00:39.240 --> 02:00:40.240]   Wait, wait.
[02:00:40.240 --> 02:00:43.360]   Can you just- can't we just download that?
[02:00:43.360 --> 02:00:44.360]   You could right now.
[02:00:44.360 --> 02:00:52.920]   Let's right click it and save it and copy- save video as- now I own the same video.
[02:00:52.920 --> 02:00:57.680]   It's an ad peg four, so you can download it right from Sotheby's page, but it's not signed
[02:00:57.680 --> 02:00:59.320]   by TBL.
[02:00:59.320 --> 02:01:08.200]   You also get a SVG of the full code, which is 841 millimeters wide by 1,189 millimeters
[02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:15.120]   high created by Sir Tim from the original files using Python with graphic representation
[02:01:15.120 --> 02:01:17.720]   of his physical signature at the lower right.
[02:01:17.720 --> 02:01:27.480]   You get a letter written in the readme.md file in quote, markdown format by Sir Tim in
[02:01:27.480 --> 02:01:33.680]   June, 2021, reflecting upon the code and his process of, "Hey, it's better than the latest
[02:01:33.680 --> 02:01:35.440]   Wu Tang Clan album."
[02:01:35.440 --> 02:01:36.440]   I mean-
[02:01:36.440 --> 02:01:38.080]   You know what this feels like?
[02:01:38.080 --> 02:01:41.720]   You remember all those radio commercials you would hear back in the day where you could
[02:01:41.720 --> 02:01:43.080]   buy your loved one a star?
[02:01:43.080 --> 02:01:44.520]   Yeah, it's like buying a star.
[02:01:44.520 --> 02:01:45.520]   Yeah.
[02:01:45.520 --> 02:01:46.520]   That's basically what this is.
[02:01:46.520 --> 02:01:47.520]   It's a bit of a scam.
[02:01:47.520 --> 02:01:50.520]   By the way, I'm pretty sure.
[02:01:50.520 --> 02:01:55.120]   I'm going to fact check the verge on this thing because they said he's never benefited
[02:01:55.120 --> 02:01:57.880]   directly from writing the code that started the web.
[02:01:57.880 --> 02:02:04.840]   I'm on technologyspeakers.com and the fee range is $100,000 or more.
[02:02:04.840 --> 02:02:05.840]   I don't know if this is accurate.
[02:02:05.840 --> 02:02:06.840]   I just Googled it.
[02:02:06.840 --> 02:02:07.840]   That's a good point.
[02:02:07.840 --> 02:02:08.840]   Come on.
[02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:12.000]   This guy's made some money from starting the web.
[02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:16.400]   You know, I was a little suspicious when- it was NBC that said it, but I was a little suspicious
[02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:17.400]   when they said it.
[02:02:17.400 --> 02:02:18.400]   Oh, NBC.
[02:02:18.400 --> 02:02:19.400]   My bet.
[02:02:19.400 --> 02:02:20.400]   Yeah.
[02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:21.400]   I mean, come on.
[02:02:21.400 --> 02:02:22.400]   Really?
[02:02:22.400 --> 02:02:23.400]   He's made some money off of this thing.
[02:02:23.400 --> 02:02:24.400]   He runs the W3C.
[02:02:24.400 --> 02:02:26.280]   I'm sure he gets paid to do that.
[02:02:26.280 --> 02:02:27.440]   He's Tim Berners-like.
[02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:29.960]   He's a freaking sir.
[02:02:29.960 --> 02:02:31.440]   That's not monetary value, but-
[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:32.440]   Yeah.
[02:02:32.440 --> 02:02:33.440]   I mean, you can't really capitalize on the sir.
[02:02:33.440 --> 02:02:35.720]   Yeah, he got a sir.
[02:02:35.720 --> 02:02:41.240]   Anyway, Southabays, tomorrow, everybody, you could spend money on Prime Day tomorrow
[02:02:41.240 --> 02:02:46.080]   or are you going crazy tomorrow, Nicholas, because of Prime Day?
[02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:47.720]   I went crazy last week.
[02:02:47.720 --> 02:02:52.880]   We were looking at some of the stuff slightly ahead of time to be ready for tomorrow.
[02:02:52.880 --> 02:02:54.480]   There's a lot of stuff.
[02:02:54.480 --> 02:02:55.480]   It's a fun day.
[02:02:55.480 --> 02:02:56.480]   It's exciting.
[02:02:56.480 --> 02:02:57.480]   People are into it.
[02:02:57.480 --> 02:03:01.880]   But for the people kind of writing about it, it is a lot of hours.
[02:03:01.880 --> 02:03:04.920]   Every tech blogger I know dreads Prime Day.
[02:03:04.920 --> 02:03:08.440]   To keep up to date with where people should be going and what they should be doing.
[02:03:08.440 --> 02:03:11.120]   And then, of course, Target's doing deal days.
[02:03:11.120 --> 02:03:16.440]   Best Buy is doing bigger deal sale and Walmart's doing dales for days.
[02:03:16.440 --> 02:03:21.840]   So all of these are all piled up one on top of the other tomorrow and the next day.
[02:03:21.840 --> 02:03:23.880]   That won't be doing any of them.
[02:03:23.880 --> 02:03:24.880]   No.
[02:03:24.880 --> 02:03:29.240]   Yeah, it kind of feels like to me, like in pro wrestling, when the two same two guys fight
[02:03:29.240 --> 02:03:32.800]   each other over and over again, you lose interest in the match.
[02:03:32.800 --> 02:03:35.520]   Prime Day kind of is like a couple of years ago, "Oh, wow, neat.
[02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:40.840]   Look, I get this SD card for, you know, 31% off," or whatever it is.
[02:03:40.840 --> 02:03:45.120]   It feels like it's losing the excitement a little bit.
[02:03:45.120 --> 02:03:46.120]   I don't know.
[02:03:46.120 --> 02:03:47.800]   I'm totally favorite folks saving money.
[02:03:47.800 --> 02:03:50.960]   You know, tomorrow is the type of day if you want to kindle tomorrow.
[02:03:50.960 --> 02:03:53.240]   It's a good day to buy stuff from Amazon.
[02:03:53.240 --> 02:03:54.240]   Yeah.
[02:03:54.240 --> 02:03:55.240]   Exactly.
[02:03:55.240 --> 02:03:56.240]   Yeah.
[02:03:56.240 --> 02:03:57.240]   Like the Echo or the King.
[02:03:57.240 --> 02:04:01.640]   I have a list of things that I need to buy anytime big sales come up and that list has
[02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:03.040]   been empty for like a year.
[02:04:03.040 --> 02:04:04.240]   You know, I really don't need anything like this.
[02:04:04.240 --> 02:04:05.240]   If you use the Edge browser.
[02:04:05.240 --> 02:04:06.240]   Oh, my God.
[02:04:06.240 --> 02:04:07.240]   It's a telly.
[02:04:07.240 --> 02:04:08.240]   It's a telly.
[02:04:08.240 --> 02:04:09.240]   No, I feel so bad about that.
[02:04:09.240 --> 02:04:10.240]   It's terrible.
[02:04:10.240 --> 02:04:11.240]   I feel bad too.
[02:04:11.240 --> 02:04:14.880]   I'm going to find a way to block that.
[02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:16.080]   I'm sure it's a switch.
[02:04:16.080 --> 02:04:17.640]   You could turn off.
[02:04:17.640 --> 02:04:19.240]   It's got to be.
[02:04:19.240 --> 02:04:21.480]   I'm still watching the source code.
[02:04:21.480 --> 02:04:26.280]   I think you should put that on a screen in the back and just let that go.
[02:04:26.280 --> 02:04:28.120]   It's pretty cool.
[02:04:28.120 --> 02:04:30.080]   I think this isn't Python.
[02:04:30.080 --> 02:04:32.040]   This is, I think this is Objective-C.
[02:04:32.040 --> 02:04:33.040]   That's not Python.
[02:04:33.040 --> 02:04:35.080]   Next computer, right?
[02:04:35.080 --> 02:04:37.200]   It's object-oriented.
[02:04:37.200 --> 02:04:42.320]   Watching this go by on the screen, I'm starting to change my perspective.
[02:04:42.320 --> 02:04:45.280]   It's so mesmerizing and I think it's a token point to it.
[02:04:45.280 --> 02:04:46.840]   That's just all the money.
[02:04:46.840 --> 02:04:48.080]   This is the rest of the episode.
[02:04:48.080 --> 02:04:54.000]   We're just going to leave this run and thank you all for joining us.
[02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.720]   It's been a wonderful Twitter episode.
[02:04:56.720 --> 02:04:58.680]   Thank you, Alex.
[02:04:58.680 --> 02:05:02.280]   Cantrowitz, big technology podcast.
[02:05:02.280 --> 02:05:03.280]   Get it right.
[02:05:03.280 --> 02:05:04.880]   No, keep the scroll going.
[02:05:04.880 --> 02:05:06.160]   We don't need to see Alex.
[02:05:06.160 --> 02:05:08.720]   We want to see Tim Berners-Lee's source code.
[02:05:08.720 --> 02:05:10.560]   I'm in the internet.
[02:05:10.560 --> 02:05:12.680]   He can see the matrix.
[02:05:12.680 --> 02:05:14.880]   That's the matrix, baby.
[02:05:14.880 --> 02:05:18.240]   Bigtechnology.substack.com at cantrowitz.
[02:05:18.240 --> 02:05:21.120]   No, no, no, no.
[02:05:21.120 --> 02:05:22.120]   You get it.
[02:05:22.120 --> 02:05:23.120]   Pretend you're typing.
[02:05:23.120 --> 02:05:24.120]   Pretend you're typing.
[02:05:24.120 --> 02:05:25.520]   Bring up the text a little bit more.
[02:05:25.520 --> 02:05:26.520]   There you go.
[02:05:26.520 --> 02:05:28.080]   And then you act like you're typing this out.
[02:05:28.080 --> 02:05:31.520]   Like you're inventing the worldwide rib right now.
[02:05:31.520 --> 02:05:32.520]   Did you see that?
[02:05:32.520 --> 02:05:34.400]   He's a space guy, not a tab guy.
[02:05:34.400 --> 02:05:35.400]   Oh, is he?
[02:05:35.400 --> 02:05:36.400]   Do you see tabs?
[02:05:36.400 --> 02:05:37.400]   I was seeing spaces.
[02:05:37.400 --> 02:05:39.040]   That was a thumb moving.
[02:05:39.040 --> 02:05:42.640]   Oh, boy, Alex busted.
[02:05:42.640 --> 02:05:43.640]   Tabs are superior.
[02:05:43.640 --> 02:05:46.720]   Apparently, I would fight you to death over that.
[02:05:46.720 --> 02:05:53.080]   But apparently, Father Robert Ballisair has the heretical notion that tabs are better
[02:05:53.080 --> 02:05:54.560]   than spaces.
[02:05:54.560 --> 02:05:57.000]   He is also the digital Jesuit.
[02:05:57.000 --> 02:06:00.800]   Go to his Twitter account, Padra ASJ, if you want to get in the server and play some
[02:06:00.800 --> 02:06:01.800]   Minecraft.
[02:06:01.800 --> 02:06:02.800]   I'm going to get in there.
[02:06:02.800 --> 02:06:06.840]   I didn't want to play in the Valheim server until I was the beefiest Viking around.
[02:06:06.840 --> 02:06:08.960]   Well, now you can show me around because I am.
[02:06:08.960 --> 02:06:12.560]   I am a beefy hell of a I got padded armor.
[02:06:12.560 --> 02:06:14.040]   I've got a black metal sword.
[02:06:14.040 --> 02:06:17.240]   I'm still running around naked.
[02:06:17.240 --> 02:06:20.760]   I could kill you without even touching it with a look.
[02:06:20.760 --> 02:06:22.000]   I could just bump into you.
[02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:24.480]   I am the beefiest Viking around.
[02:06:24.480 --> 02:06:25.480]   Thank you, Father Robert.
[02:06:25.480 --> 02:06:26.480]   We really appreciate it.
[02:06:26.480 --> 02:06:27.680]   Also, thanks so much.
[02:06:27.680 --> 02:06:32.520]   Nicholas de Leon from the Consumer Reports, Senior Reporter Consumer Reports.
[02:06:32.520 --> 02:06:35.680]   Is it CR.org?
[02:06:35.680 --> 02:06:36.680]   That works.
[02:06:36.680 --> 02:06:38.120]   Consumer Reports.org also works.
[02:06:38.120 --> 02:06:40.280]   You just search Consumer Reports.
[02:06:40.280 --> 02:06:41.560]   We'll pop up.
[02:06:41.560 --> 02:06:43.240]   You should be a member.
[02:06:43.240 --> 02:06:44.520]   Tabs are spaces.
[02:06:44.520 --> 02:06:47.520]   Which is it?
[02:06:47.520 --> 02:06:49.400]   I think I always did spaces.
[02:06:49.400 --> 02:06:50.400]   It's spaces.
[02:06:50.400 --> 02:06:51.400]   Why?
[02:06:51.400 --> 02:06:53.440]   Tabs are just so many.
[02:06:53.440 --> 02:06:54.440]   No, but that's not.
[02:06:54.440 --> 02:06:55.440]   Wait, it is.
[02:06:55.440 --> 02:06:56.440]   You're right.
[02:06:56.440 --> 02:06:57.440]   We got to talk about this for a minute.
[02:06:57.440 --> 02:07:00.760]   I don't want to leave here without understanding the argument for Tabs.
[02:07:00.760 --> 02:07:02.800]   So, what is the argument?
[02:07:02.800 --> 02:07:03.800]   There is no good argument.
[02:07:03.800 --> 02:07:05.440]   What are we doing with the tab?
[02:07:05.440 --> 02:07:10.760]   So when you're coding, people, we set our hierarchy of loops and stuff.
[02:07:10.760 --> 02:07:12.920]   Just watch this code while we talk.
[02:07:12.920 --> 02:07:14.520]   You need to pause the code.
[02:07:14.520 --> 02:07:15.520]   See this?
[02:07:15.520 --> 02:07:16.520]   This is basically what I was just trying to do.
[02:07:16.520 --> 02:07:17.520]   I want to get the code back.
[02:07:17.520 --> 02:07:20.120]   Get that code back on the screen.
[02:07:20.120 --> 02:07:25.440]   The question is, do you indent by hitting tab once or twice or you type space above?
[02:07:25.440 --> 02:07:29.400]   Now, if you're using Emacs and you hit tab, it'll convert it to spaces because that's
[02:07:29.400 --> 02:07:31.200]   the only one true form.
[02:07:31.200 --> 02:07:33.880]   So you could use it as a shortcut key, I guess.
[02:07:33.880 --> 02:07:36.280]   But ultimately, it can't be tabs.
[02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:37.280]   It has to be spaced.
[02:07:37.280 --> 02:07:38.280]   You know what?
[02:07:38.280 --> 02:07:42.480]   The only reason people like spaces is because it feels better to thump it with your thumb
[02:07:42.480 --> 02:07:44.480]   versus tab with the pinky.
[02:07:44.480 --> 02:07:49.080]   I'm going to accept it that you're pinking your tab, but I want it to be replaced by
[02:07:49.080 --> 02:07:51.600]   spaces because otherwise it's the formatting.
[02:07:51.600 --> 02:07:52.600]   You don't know what you're going to get.
[02:07:52.600 --> 02:07:56.080]   I'm going to make a big button that just sits on the side of the keyboard, but you
[02:07:56.080 --> 02:07:57.480]   can just slap it and it will tab.
[02:07:57.480 --> 02:07:59.480]   And I bet people will use that more than the space bar.
[02:07:59.480 --> 02:08:01.360]   I wonder how long this seems like a lot of work.
[02:08:01.360 --> 02:08:02.360]   I wonder how long it feels good.
[02:08:02.360 --> 02:08:03.360]   This is the most...
[02:08:03.360 --> 02:08:06.400]   I appreciate you explaining this, but I'm so impressed.
[02:08:06.400 --> 02:08:09.960]   With Tim Berners-Lee's comments, he's got...
[02:08:09.960 --> 02:08:13.240]   There's no way this is what it looked like when he first wrote it.
[02:08:13.240 --> 02:08:14.880]   He has gone back in.
[02:08:14.880 --> 02:08:16.360]   He has added comments.
[02:08:16.360 --> 02:08:17.360]   He's added lines.
[02:08:17.360 --> 02:08:19.040]   He's cleaned the whole thing up.
[02:08:19.040 --> 02:08:20.040]   He's really...
[02:08:20.040 --> 02:08:22.160]   I've gotten better about commenting my code as I go.
[02:08:22.160 --> 02:08:25.720]   I no longer let it become spaghetti and then go back and go, why did I write this?
[02:08:25.720 --> 02:08:26.720]   Look at this.
[02:08:26.720 --> 02:08:29.400]   "The History" written by Tim Berners-Lee.
[02:08:29.400 --> 02:08:30.920]   I'm downloading that.
[02:08:30.920 --> 02:08:33.520]   That's actually a really cool video.
[02:08:33.520 --> 02:08:35.800]   This is my new screen saver.
[02:08:35.800 --> 02:08:37.760]   That's a great screen saver.
[02:08:37.760 --> 02:08:38.760]   And guess what?
[02:08:38.760 --> 02:08:40.760]   You don't have to buy the NFT to do this.
[02:08:40.760 --> 02:08:42.120]   Actually, that's the next person.
[02:08:42.120 --> 02:08:43.120]   That's right.
[02:08:43.120 --> 02:08:44.120]   Click and save.
[02:08:44.120 --> 02:08:46.080]   As Windows 12, we're watching it right now.
[02:08:46.080 --> 02:08:49.240]   Actually, you might not be too far off the world wide web.
[02:08:49.240 --> 02:08:53.160]   Basically, it's the future of all operating systems.
[02:08:53.160 --> 02:08:54.160]   Thank you, Alex.
[02:08:54.160 --> 02:08:55.160]   Thank you, Nicholas.
[02:08:55.160 --> 02:08:56.160]   Thank you, Robert.
[02:08:56.160 --> 02:08:57.160]   Great to have all of you.
[02:08:57.160 --> 02:08:58.160]   Thank you for being here.
[02:08:58.160 --> 02:09:00.440]   We do Twitch every Sunday afternoon.
[02:09:00.440 --> 02:09:01.440]   2 p.m.
[02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:02.960]   No, what time do we do it at?
[02:09:02.960 --> 02:09:03.960]   2.30 p.m.
[02:09:03.960 --> 02:09:04.960]   I don't even know.
[02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:08.280]   When I get here, 2.30 p.m.
[02:09:08.280 --> 02:09:12.840]   Pacific, 5.30, Eastern, 21.30, UTC.
[02:09:12.840 --> 02:09:15.720]   You can watch us do it live at twitter.tv/live.
[02:09:15.720 --> 02:09:17.640]   There's a live audio stream and video stream.
[02:09:17.640 --> 02:09:19.520]   If you're doing that, chat live.
[02:09:19.520 --> 02:09:30.680]   We have a new YouTube channel dedicated to Twitch.
[02:09:30.680 --> 02:09:35.040]   In fact, we have a new -- I want to send everybody to youtube.com/twit for our new tech break
[02:09:35.040 --> 02:09:36.040]   feature.
[02:09:36.040 --> 02:09:39.620]   Whenever breaking news happens, we've been saying, "Well, we'll wait till Twitch in
[02:09:39.620 --> 02:09:40.620]   three days."
[02:09:40.620 --> 02:09:44.660]   No, we're going to cover it right then.
[02:09:44.660 --> 02:09:48.500]   Jason Howell, Mike Asargent, Ant Pruitt, and I -- something comes up.
[02:09:48.500 --> 02:09:51.860]   We're going to put that on the Twitch break -- Twitter tech break feed.
[02:09:51.860 --> 02:09:56.220]   Twitter.tv/tv, if you want to subscribe to that.
[02:09:56.220 --> 02:09:58.980]   There's also a YouTube channel for that.
[02:09:58.980 --> 02:09:59.980]   Let's see.
[02:09:59.980 --> 02:10:00.980]   We're talking about Twitter.
[02:10:00.980 --> 02:10:05.060]   Oh, subscribe to your favorite podcast player, to any of our podcasts.
[02:10:05.060 --> 02:10:06.060]   Just search for Twitch.
[02:10:06.060 --> 02:10:08.420]   You'll find the network probably in all the shows.
[02:10:08.420 --> 02:10:10.660]   If you like a show, leave us a five-star review.
[02:10:10.660 --> 02:10:13.340]   If you don't like it, we're called tech.
[02:10:13.340 --> 02:10:14.340]   What is it?
[02:10:14.340 --> 02:10:15.340]   Big tech podcast.
[02:10:15.340 --> 02:10:19.220]   If you don't like it, just --
[02:10:19.220 --> 02:10:21.060]   Big tech podcast.
[02:10:21.060 --> 02:10:22.060]   Big tech podcast.
[02:10:22.060 --> 02:10:24.060]   Yeah, don't subscribe to it.
[02:10:24.060 --> 02:10:25.060]   Don't subscribe to it.
[02:10:25.060 --> 02:10:27.060]   Leave a one-star review.
[02:10:27.060 --> 02:10:28.060]   Big technology podcast.
[02:10:28.060 --> 02:10:29.060]   No, no, no.
[02:10:29.060 --> 02:10:30.160]   You missed the point.
[02:10:30.160 --> 02:10:33.140]   I was sending the bad reviews to big tech podcasts.
[02:10:33.140 --> 02:10:34.140]   Oh, I see.
[02:10:34.140 --> 02:10:35.140]   Yeah.
[02:10:35.140 --> 02:10:36.140]   Do it anyway.
[02:10:36.140 --> 02:10:37.140]   Do it anyway.
[02:10:37.140 --> 02:10:40.140]   Do it anyway.
[02:10:40.140 --> 02:10:43.020]   We also have a club for people who hate advertising.
[02:10:43.020 --> 02:10:44.020]   I don't blame you.
[02:10:44.020 --> 02:10:46.020]   Who wants to listen to it?
[02:10:46.020 --> 02:10:47.980]   Listen to Leo, read the ad.
[02:10:47.980 --> 02:10:52.340]   Just go to a Twitch.tv/club, Twitter, subscribe.
[02:10:52.340 --> 02:10:55.380]   Add free versions of all the shows, audio and video.
[02:10:55.380 --> 02:10:57.060]   Add free means, track are free too.
[02:10:57.060 --> 02:10:58.460]   Got to point that out.
[02:10:58.460 --> 02:11:02.700]   You also get access to our wonderful Discord channel, some great people in there, and
[02:11:02.700 --> 02:11:07.620]   our Twitter+ bonus feed with all the stuff that didn't make it to the shows.
[02:11:07.620 --> 02:11:11.980]   Yes, I admit that makes it sound like it wasn't as good as the other shows.
[02:11:11.980 --> 02:11:12.980]   It's not.
[02:11:12.980 --> 02:11:13.980]   It's free.
[02:11:13.980 --> 02:11:15.620]   Well, it's seven bucks a month, actually.
[02:11:15.620 --> 02:11:16.860]   So that's like free.
