[00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.360]   We're at org slash blog.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.880]   Right.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.400]   Welcome back.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.600]   No stripes on the shirt, just plain gray.
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.880]   No, it's not plain, I get different things.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.280]   Oh, you have two tones, it's a little British, it's a little bread collar.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.560]   You know, I should for the audio listeners, people often complain, "Hey, we don't watch, so could you please describe John's wardrobe?"
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:03.800]   He's wearing a red T-shirt with a spread collar, two toned gray and light gray shirt with initials JCS on it.
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.680]   Yes, that's GCS.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.480]   That's cursive writing.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.480]   It's monogrammed.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.480]   It is.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.480]   It's beautiful.
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.480]   If it's a no-chir extra charge at the Lilight Taylor in Taipei.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.480]   Is this your Hong Kong?
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.280]   I do not want to hear about your Asian trips.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.760]   No, no, John's famous for this.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.960]   He's Asian trips.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.480]   I have some good detailers.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.960]   That is Becky Worley sitting next to John C. Devorak.
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.120]   That is always a risk.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.120]   Yes.
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.680]   Becky from Good Morning America at B Warley on Twitter.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.680]   So nice to see you again.
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.680]   Thank you.
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.680]   All right, just to get that vlog out from in front of you.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.680]   There's a bunch of you.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.280]   I attract new flies.
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.480]   Becky is also not a claim to fame, really a claim to it.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.480]   I'm not a mini.
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.720]   How do you pronounce that?
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.720]   A Monteado?
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.200]   A Monte Dido Dado.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.320]   Becky is the original producer of the screensabers and call for help.
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.720]   So she gets credit for both.
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.720]   Yep.
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.920]   Leo wrote my recommendation to grad school.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.240]   I've known you a long time.
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.280]   I slept in a sleeping bag on the floor of your house once.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.920]   That will not be discussed.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.480]   Becky's the greatest.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.080]   It's great to have you.
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.880]   Also back with us from Venturebeat Jolie Odell.
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:09.880]   Hello, Jolie.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.880]   Good to see you.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:11.880]   Hello, Leo.
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:12.880]   Yes, thank you.
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.200]   I saw in your blog that you'll no longer bring us baked goods.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.200]   I'm Shagrinden satinned.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.000]   Well, I almost brought you some today.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.640]   The recipe was called slutty brownies.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.080]   But since we have a lady here today, I figured I'd rain it in a little bit.
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.920]   You really couldn't blame me if I had said something about that.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:28.920]   No, I know.
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:29.920]   Wow.
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:30.920]   It makes them slutty out of curiosity.
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.920]   Oh, they're filthy and easy.
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.920]   That's what the internet told me about the recipe.
[00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:35.920]   Makes it makes a mess.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:36.920]   Oh my God.
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.120]   Well, it's a layer of chocolate chip cookie dough, a layer of double stuffed Oreos.
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.000]   And then you pulled brownie batter on top of that and bake it for a half hour.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.840]   So they come out warm and gooey and really bad for you kind of like, well, never mind.
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:49.840]   Slutty brownies.
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:50.840]   Yeah, slutty brownies.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:51.840]   So top story.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:52.840]   You know what?
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:53.840]   I think you should...
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.480]   This is going to be so good.
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:56.480]   It's going to be...
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.480]   It's going to be...
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.480]   It's going to be...
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.480]   It's going to be...
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:00.480]   It's going to be...
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:01.480]   It's going to be...
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.480]   You can see problems.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:03.480]   You can see problems coming, can't you?
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.480]   Well, drink up, sir.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:09.800]   It's actually a good week for that because the news is not particularly compelling.
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.800]   But I will start.
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.800]   I'm going to number...
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.800]   Really meat and potatoes.
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.800]   Yeah, it's very basic stuff.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:14.800]   So I expect you guys to dress it up.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.800]   Let's hit it hard.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.760]   Put a little Oreo cookie layer on top.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:20.760]   Apple...
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:23.520]   Story 1, Apple gives developers fully baked mountain lion get ready.
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.520]   Apple's going to...
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.160]   If there were a race, which there isn't, but if there were a race between Windows 8 and
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.800]   the next version of OS X, Apple would win by several lengths next...
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.480]   This month, I guess, July.
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:37.120]   Before the end of the month, they expect to ship the latest version of OS X.
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:38.280]   Okay, very quickly.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.000]   What are you excited about?
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.360]   The couple of things that I think are not exciting but of newsworthy one is the continued
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.760]   iOSification of the desktop.
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.560]   And this is a trend on both Windows and Apple's OS X, which is...
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.640]   Ocification makes sense.
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.520]   Ocification, they want to turn these things into tablets.
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.640]   And the thing that bugs me and I'm curious what you guys think...
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:04.160]   The real trend is towards full screen apps, which makes sense on a tablet with a small
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.160]   screen.
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:10.080]   I'm not even on an 11-inch air, which I have in front of me, but on my 27-inch iMac...
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.080]   It's a disaster.
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.080]   It's a disaster.
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.560]   Who needs a big giant app on the thing you can't shrink it?
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.560]   You can't.
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.560]   No, it's a throwback.
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.280]   It's a throwback to DOS.
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.920]   Inmates running the asylum, nobody has that monitor.
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.400]   Oh, really?
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.400]   Everybody has small monitors.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.600]   Bull's crap, I've got it.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.720]   My wife's got it.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.440]   My son's got one.
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.160]   Everybody in our family has a 27-inch monitor.
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.160]   You're the only people I know.
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.160]   No, no, no.
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.160]   He's got one.
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:38.960]   Everybody in their right mind who's ever had access to a 27-inch monitor will buy one.
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.960]   They're not expensive.
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.720]   I think anyone that's over the age of 40, when their eyesight starts going, they're
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.920]   all going to be buying 27-inch monitors.
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.360]   So this is bucking the trend.
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.040]   I think that you're already in the tent.
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.200]   What's the point?
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.400]   So you'll use a fully baked application.
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.280]   You'll use Windows 7 as what you'll do.
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:56.440]   You won't go to Windows 8.
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.840]   And then Windows 9.
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:58.840]   And skip over.
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:06:59.840]   Yeah.
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:00.840]   If Windows 9...
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:01.840]   No, see, I think Microsoft's made the move.
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:02.840]   I don't think Microsoft's going backwards.
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:03.840]   They're going to get it.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:04.840]   They're going to...
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:05.840]   You don't have to?
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:06.840]   The feedback is going to be very negative.
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.120]   We are headed towards, I think, a car wreck.
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.120]   What do you think, Jolie?
[00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.440]   You're the one person sitting at the table using Windows right now.
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.440]   By the way, on a very nice...
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.440]   I use Windows 8.
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.440]   I use Windows 8.
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.200]   Well, we all use it, but we're not using it right now.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.200]   She is.
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.200]   I am.
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.200]   And I'm using Windows 7.
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.200]   And I do like it.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.840]   I try out Windows 8 on another one of my Windows laptops.
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:25.840]   And I didn't love it.
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.360]   And I don't think that it's going to go over too very well in the enterprise.
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.720]   It's a little bit fluffy and a little bit distracting.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.800]   And I think that's where Microsoft really...
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.680]   They need to get people on board.
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.000]   And I think the enterprise is going to wait for Windows 9.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.680]   And maybe that'll be a little bit more pared down, a little less.
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:45.280]   Ooh, look at our flashy tiles and all this great design and maybe a little more business-friendly.
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:50.360]   What is stimulating this move, though, towards making your desktop applications look like
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.920]   tablet applications, this full-screen thing?
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.640]   Is it the success of the iPad that everybody wants to emulate?
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:56.640]   What's...
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:57.640]   Why are we seeing that?
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:02.280]   Well, for so long, people have associated Apple products with great design, right?
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:08.600]   And I think Microsoft is doing their darnedest to beat that assumption that only Apple can
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:09.600]   make well-designed things.
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.600]   Did you like the Surface?
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.800]   Did you look at the Surface again excited?
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:12.800]   I did.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:15.560]   I never get excited about anything.
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.560]   You should know better.
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.560]   No.
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.600]   And I don't really care about the Surface.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.360]   I think it's going to do fine.
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.840]   But they're not planning on selling very many, just a couple million, a few million.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.200]   This is not a big part of their business going forward.
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.480]   So what is it, a reference design to inspire the OEMs?
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:33.960]   Why are they doing it?
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.960]   Why would you do something that's only going to explain?
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.840]   Please explain to me.
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:41.640]   Microsoft has a long-term strategy based on the Apple stores.
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.080]   They've got 26 stores now.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.080]   They're going to eventually roll out.
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:45.920]   The Apple's got over 300.
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:49.280]   They're going to eventually roll out store after store after store.
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:52.080]   People have to realize that the Apple store makes more money per square foot than any
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.480]   retailer, including Tiffany's, in history.
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.520]   And Microsoft has noticed this.
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.760]   And they're basically copying the stores.
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.000]   Per say they're going to roll out a tablet, they're going to roll out a branded computer,
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.080]   they're going to roll out Microsoft this and Microsoft that.
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:07.240]   And it has to be high design.
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.440]   That's the reason the Surface was over-designed.
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.800]   And they're going to move stuff through the store because they have, and they've got the
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.760]   Xbox and the Xbox.
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.280]   They've got a bunch of things they can sell in those stores and they're going to, and
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:17.960]   they're going retail big.
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.560]   And that's what the real back, backroom strategy is.
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.680]   And you'll see it probably roll out in the next four or five years completely and people
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.560]   will finally realize what happened and the reason that the Surface came out and why it
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.440]   is designed the way it is because it's designed to be shown to somebody.
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:35.640]   In fact, they have said we will not sell this, and I thought it was to protect OEMs like Lenovo
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.240]   and Dell and Samsung and HP.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.840]   They've said we will not sell this in retail.
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.520]   We'll only sell it at Microsoft stores, at our own retail.
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:43.520]   Yeah.
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.520]   I see it.
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:45.520]   This is to drive people to the stores.
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:46.520]   What have these Microsoft stores?
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:47.520]   What have these Microsoft stores?
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:48.520]   They look just like Apple stores.
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:49.520]   They look just like Apple stores.
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.760]   No, they look much more beautiful and colorful, I think.
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:56.040]   And I think if you look at the Microsoft retail stores, you can see what their vision is for
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.280]   retail and it's absolutely gorgeous.
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.280]   But I just-
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.280]   Where is the Microsoft store?
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.280]   There's not one in San Francisco.
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.280]   There's one in Palo Alto.
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:05.280]   There's one in, oh Lord, they maybe drive down to the mall.
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:06.280]   They're from Bellevue Mall, I'm sure.
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.280]   There's in a mall.
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.920]   The Palo Alto's got one that there's a big mall that says-
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.520]   Yeah, like, you know, I do believe they are opening one in the city.
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:16.360]   Well, I apologize because I've never been, I've only seen pictures, but to me the pictures,
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:20.600]   the blonde wood, the open spaces, lots of glass, the genius bar.
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.160]   No, guru, pardon me.
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.520]   The guru bar.
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.360]   It looks a lot like an Apple store to me.
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.360]   It is a lot like an Apple store.
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:30.640]   John, I think you're on crack because this just seems like it's totally out of left field
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:31.640]   given that-
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:32.640]   I mean-
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:33.640]   You're not paying attention.
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.280]   That's the reason you think it's out of left field.
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:36.280]   Okay, that's fine.
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:37.280]   I don't-
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:41.560]   You are always very insightful and have a long view and sometimes you're right.
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:42.560]   Sometimes.
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:43.560]   Twice.
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:44.560]   Yeah.
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.560]   But here's the thing.
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.560]   It's this week.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.880]   Microsoft is a software company.
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.960]   Like let's not forget that.
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:51.960]   Isn't that always-
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:52.960]   They've forgotten.
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:53.960]   Oh no, that's the law.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:54.960]   I know.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:55.960]   You know what?
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:56.960]   Xbox 360.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:57.960]   It's the truth.
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:58.960]   That's true.
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:10:58.960]   That's the one-
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:10:59.960]   I'm going to tell you exactly why.
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:00.960]   We have Surface.
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:01.960]   The lines have crossed.
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:06.960]   So there was a- there's a good graph and I think it was on the Asymco blog where they
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.840]   show profits from hardware and software.
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.240]   John said this all the time.
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.480]   Who's wallet would you rather have?
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.360]   Bill Gates or Steve Jobs.
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:18.200]   For a long time Bill Gates and software, we're making lots more money than hardware.
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:22.720]   That line crossed last year, Apple is now more profitable than Microsoft.
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:28.360]   Hardware, no, you know, the Asymco blog asserts, and I think this is a good way of putting it,
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:34.760]   that the days of expensive software on cheap hardware are over, that the future is cheap
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.360]   software on expensive hardware.
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.360]   Totally agree with you.
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.360]   Well, I totally agree with you.
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.160]   And the thing is though, and sorry, Julia, just-
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.160]   No, go right ahead.
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:45.560]   Think about this and tell me if I'm wrong is, okay, Amazon's making hardware so they can
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:48.360]   sell you stuff or books or media.
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.760]   Right, Google and two.
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:53.560]   Google is trying to sell you advertising.
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:59.680]   Microsoft is not sure what it's trying to sell you and Apple is trying to sell you hardware.
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:03.160]   And so fundamentally, I think Microsoft is confused.
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.360]   But what Amazon is- Amazon is-
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.560]   I agree and this is what you're seeing.
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.560]   You're seeing Microsoft.
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:12.560]   Instead of being active, they're being reactive, instead of being proactive.
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:13.560]   And this is new?
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.080]   And what they've always done this?
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.560]   And what they're- it's this Apple jealousy.
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:17.560]   They're saying Apple's doing so.
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:18.560]   Well, the stores we got to have stores.
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.560]   Apple's doing so with hardware.
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:20.560]   We got to have hardware.
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:21.560]   And it's-
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:22.560]   That's not focus.
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.560]   You know, I have to say, and don't tell Paul Thorett, I say this, but I think this is
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.560]   the- and please don't tell Jolio Dela.
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.560]   But I think this is the worst run company since RIM.
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:31.560]   Well, this is now-
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:32.560]   Well, it's not off it.
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:34.560]   That isn't true at all.
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:37.760]   If they're running it so badly, then how come they're still making so much money?
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:38.760]   How come-
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:39.760]   Inertia.
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:43.760]   Normal people outside of Silicon Valley are running windows on their PCs.
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:47.760]   They're not running around with, you know, expensive Macs and 27-inch monitors.
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:51.160]   It's pure inertia and then- and the trend is not their friend and this is why Microsoft's
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:52.160]   panicking.
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.080]   Well, that's why they are getting ahead and their panic.
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:58.240]   If there is panic, it's a good thing because it's making them better designers and it's
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.760]   making them more innovative in the software and hardware.
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:04.920]   And I think that those two things are just getting fused back in the day when I started
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:06.120]   with computers.
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:10.720]   You could put any software you wanted to on your hardware and today I don't think the
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.960]   average consumer sees those two things as things that you can split apart.
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.720]   It's like you're soloing your body, they go together.
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:18.840]   Alan Kay always said you want to make great software, you got to make the hardware.
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.960]   Well, now, and then Google was a software company once upon a time and then they are
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:26.720]   getting so far in bed with hardware that they now make this Nexus Q device.
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.920]   That's their first branded hardware and oh my lord, have you seen that?
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:30.720]   It's not their first silly, pretty bad.
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:31.960]   Well, yeah, it's weird.
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.520]   I have one at my house and I can't figure out what the heck to do with this.
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:35.520]   There's no point.
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:38.120]   So once it's around, it's like we could play cricket with it.
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:39.120]   It's a or make a one-off.
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.120]   Dog toy.
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.120]   Okay, ball.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:43.320]   Can I just circle back from what Jolie was saying and what you were saying?
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:47.000]   So you're saying they want to go into retail, but do you think that's good, bad, long-term
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.360]   cohesive or do you think we can't have that?
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:54.160]   I have been a huge fan of the retail concept that it was that was essentially developed
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:57.840]   and perfected by the car manufacturers since the days that they had a dealership.
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.680]   Aren't those all franchises though?
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:00.680]   They're not owned.
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:01.960]   No, it's a combination.
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.680]   It's like McDonald's used to be.
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:04.680]   Okay.
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.240]   Yeah, even so.
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.240]   Doesn't matter.
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:08.240]   Doesn't matter.
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:13.440]   The point is that you control the sales pitch and the problem with CompUSA and computer,
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:16.720]   the problem was that when computer land got so big, it screwed things up, started with
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.160]   the bite shop, went to computer land, then we went to...
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:20.160]   Look at Best Buy.
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.160]   What's happening to Best Buy?
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.160]   They're dying.
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.160]   Because they don't...
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.160]   There's just the mess in there.
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.160]   But when you went to Comp--
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:27.800]   No, because everybody's buying on Amazon and I'm going to tell you in story number two,
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:28.800]   why?
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:32.280]   Okay, well, they may be buying on Amazon, but you can't deny that the Apple store, they're
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.800]   buying there a lot.
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:34.640]   Oh, huge.
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:35.640]   No, they're going to use it.
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:40.160]   But it's the exception that proves the rule, isn't it?
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.560]   And well, quick sidebar, have you seen the new Samsung stores?
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:43.560]   Absolutely, with that one.
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:44.560]   Well, isn't that...
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.440]   I mean, seriously, I mean, yes, Apple's doing well.
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.440]   Everybody else is doing poorly.
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:50.120]   Does that mean retail is on the upswing or the downswing?
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.120]   No, I'm doing well.
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.120]   And then let me get back to the point.
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:55.440]   And the reason Apple did this is because you had to be able to see Apple hardware because
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.440]   nobody was showing it.
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:58.520]   You go to Best Buy and it'd be a dusty thing at the point.
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:00.440]   Do they have a little Apple segment of it?
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.440]   They do and it's crap.
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:02.440]   Okay.
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.440]   And so Apple said, and I know this is what happened, Steve Jobs said, "No, I'm not going
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:05.440]   to sell Apple.
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:08.440]   The only way we're ever going to sell is by having our own retail where we can highlight
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.880]   our products in an appropriate way."
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.120]   That's the right motivation.
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.120]   Microsoft's motivation is the wrong motivation.
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:17.440]   Best Buy feels like the wrong stress for less compared to the Apple store.
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:18.440]   The reason it doesn't feel bad.
[00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:19.440]   It doesn't feel bad.
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.440]   So you can control the sales pitch.
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:22.440]   That's the only reason.
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.440]   That's right.
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:24.440]   I agree.
[00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.040]   You, guy comes in, you got everybody trained to sell one thing.
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:27.040]   Your products.
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.040]   Right.
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:31.800]   You go to CompUSA, whoever's buying, who's are bribing you the most of the spiff you get
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:32.800]   from this guy?
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.840]   Yeah, this is, everyone says it's junk.
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:36.000]   No, no, no, it's great.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   I agree.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.320]   I also, I think you're right.
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:43.160]   And I think people don't trust the employees as much for their knowledge in those bigger
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.440]   super stores, electronic super stores, than as they do in an Apple store.
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:50.760]   They feel like Apple's attention to detail on product is transferring to the employees
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:51.760]   who are going to help you.
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.040]   When's the last time you've been, you guys all must agree with this.
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.960]   You go in an Apple store, it's chaotic because it's so popular.
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:57.960]   Yeah.
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:58.960]   It's crazy.
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:15:59.960]   I see a lot of guys standing around doing nothing to you.
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:02.760]   I can't remember the last time I went in one because, you know, I don't, I don't know
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:03.760]   what's going on.
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:04.760]   You should just go just to slow.
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:09.080]   No, I went, when, when Mr. Jobs passed, I went to an Apple store to be a reporter and,
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:10.960]   you know, a man on the street type interviews.
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:11.960]   It's not going to be his chaotic behavior.
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:12.960]   No, it was absolutely mobbed.
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:13.960]   It was mobbed.
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:14.960]   But then it always is.
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:15.960]   That's a different.
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:19.000]   Every time you walk by and you know downtown or Palo Alto, it's all these people, but
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.160]   they're sticky fingers touching things and I just hate it.
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:27.320]   So that way, let's take a look at this meaty, poorly run company that you just brought up,
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.560]   $73 billion in revenue last year.
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:30.560]   Now is this my business?
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:35.080]   It's a gross profit, $54 billion from 73 in sales.
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.080]   It's inertia.
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.080]   Total cash, $58 billion.
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:40.080]   Yeah, but it's going down and I got to tell you.
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.080]   It's not going down.
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.600]   I can give you a rough, I can give you data point after data point of.
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.800]   You are just part of the propaganda machine that is trying to.
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:47.800]   It's true.
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:48.800]   And you know what?
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.600]   It does not matter what any PR machine says about anything, the money will talk and the
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.160]   money will continue to talk.
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:56.960]   And I do not think it's correct to say that their profits are going down.
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:00.440]   In fact, as I recall, they had a record quarter last time I covered their earnings.
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:01.440]   They did.
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.760]   Now they're going down relative to Apple is what I'm saying.
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.280]   Apple just happens to be blooming.
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:09.880]   Now let's take a look at the hit piece done in Vanity Fair just came out on Ballmer.
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.680]   $6.5 billion right down for Quantiv.
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.200]   Total over what's great.
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.360]   Yeah, that was a blunder, it was a complete idiotic move.
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:18.440]   That's a $6.5 billion dollar blunder.
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:19.440]   And it's a big deal.
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.440]   Just years ago.
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.440]   The fact that it's just-
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:22.440]   I'll give you more.
[00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.440]   No, I got data points galore.
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:26.280]   You announce a Windows phone eight while you're still trying to sell Windows phone seven.
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:27.280]   Idiots.
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.520]   And you tell people no upgrade for you.
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:29.520]   You can upgrade that.
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.880]   You can money hand over fist.
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.600]   They can afford to make all these blunders.
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:35.560]   Well, at this, okay, at some point, that's what I'm saying.
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.040]   They are making money hand over fist.
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.040]   It's inertia.
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.880]   At some point, mismanagement is going to kill this company.
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:43.480]   Maybe they'll survive just like IBM out of inertia.
[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:45.320]   But they are poorly managed right now.
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.320]   That's the only point I'm making.
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:47.320]   It does seem-
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:50.560]   But what about the fact that they continue and they're making more and more beautifully
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:52.360]   designed products that consumers are getting excited about?
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:53.360]   Wait a minute.
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:54.520]   What's the spring resolution on the surface?
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:55.520]   We don't know.
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:56.520]   When's the surface available?
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:57.520]   Wait a minute.
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:58.520]   Somebody cares.
[00:17:58.520 --> 00:17:59.520]   When's the surface available?
[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:01.000]   When's the surface available?
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   We don't know.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.160]   What's the price of the surface?
[00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.160]   We don't know.
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.160]   Are they making-
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.160]   Has anybody held a surface?
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:07.160]   No.
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.160]   No.
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:11.160]   This is a made up product that has no real existence and you're going crazy over it.
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.160]   No, no, I'm not saying the surface.
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:15.400]   I'm saying Windows eight and Windows phone and the interesting between the same one.
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.800]   Windows eight will be vastly rejected by the marketplace.
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:18.800]   Watch, mark my words.
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:19.800]   You've said it yourself, John.
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.240]   I have said this from the get go.
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.800]   So what is Microsoft doing so right?
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:25.840]   Apparently, making lots of money.
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:26.840]   I think they have inertia.
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:27.840]   Inertia.
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:28.840]   There's a lot of-
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:32.000]   It's tick-tock, so they keep coming back.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   We'll see.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.320]   When they have one really bad quarter, then I'm-
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:39.200]   Well, you can't really short them because the stock has been dead money for a decade.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.120]   I think the stock market knows that they're really-
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:42.880]   No, they're like you.
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:46.640]   They all see it the way you see it, which is like these guys are idiots.
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:48.400]   But meanwhile, they keep making more and more money.
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.400]   They get no credit for it.
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.400]   They got no charisma.
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.400]   Ballmer's getting hit.
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.560]   I'm telling you, you've got to look at this vanity therapies.
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:57.720]   They brought out stack ranking, which is one of the worst possible management-
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:01.160]   Microsoft's defense on this is we're not the only company doing it.
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.560]   What do you say about that stock?
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:04.560]   What is stack ranking?
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:05.560]   What is stack ranking?
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:07.000]   Stack ranking and it's done by-
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.760]   In fact, I put a call out for people who-
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:12.160]   And I'm going to put it out again right here on the show.
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:17.960]   Anyone whose company does stack or forced ranking, which is a technique used by HR departments,
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:19.400]   please get a hold of me.
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:23.520]   The easiest way to describe this is survivor.
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:24.520]   Only-
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:25.520]   Yeah, you get voted off the island.
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:26.520]   You get voted off the island.
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:27.520]   No matter how good you are.
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:31.320]   If you're the lowest ranking performance employee, that's it.
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:34.160]   I'm under the impression that somebody's going to have to correct us that he-
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:38.920]   Bold when he came in as the COO at Microsoft in the late '90s, brought it over from Procter
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.080]   and Gamble.
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:43.280]   And Ballmer was very amenable to it because he's the next Procter and Gamble guy.
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:44.880]   Apparently they did it there.
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.600]   They've done it at General Electric.
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:51.000]   It was popularized by Jack Welch who brought it up at General Electric and took credit-
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.840]   They gave credit to forced ranking, which also said, "I want to fire 10% of the entire
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:00.960]   company every year," which he did for a decade, meaning he turned over the entire company,
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:03.520]   probably getting rid of a lot of good people in the process.
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:07.040]   It was dropped immediately after Welch got kicked out.
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:12.280]   And Welch, by the way, gives stacked ranking credit for GE's big growth spurt during the
[00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:15.160]   Reagan administration when the economy had turned around.
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.840]   It was a defense contractor.
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.200]   Anybody would have made money.
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:24.680]   So the whole thing is a huge scam and it's ruining American business.
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:27.320]   And the reason we're in a depression is because of it.
[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:29.320]   So you just keep proving my point, John.
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:32.320]   You keep coming up with things Microsoft's not doing very well.
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:35.840]   Now, by the way, one of the complaints about the way Microsoft's doing stack ranking is
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.800]   that it doesn't seem to be metric-based.
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:39.640]   It seems to be politically- Oh, yeah.
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:42.840]   I know you have to- If you're my buddy, we're in business together.
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:44.840]   We make a deal with survivors.
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:45.840]   Exactly.
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:46.840]   I give you a one.
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:47.840]   You give me a one.
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:48.840]   Jolie, you get a five-year-out.
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:49.840]   Oh, damn.
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:52.440]   So you could see why this is problematic.
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:54.640]   I think there's some structural problems as a company as well.
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:56.440]   They have a lot of- They've seen worse.
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.440]   They've seen worse.
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:00.520]   Stack ranking has made all the real talented people in Microsoft.
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:01.720]   They all either left.
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:02.720]   They quit.
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.840]   And the way it works is that you get these low ratings and you're given a choice.
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:07.480]   We think you're going to have to improve.
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.200]   If you don't improve, we're going to fire you.
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.000]   But we'll give you an easy out.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.800]   We'll give you some money if you quit.
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:15.600]   So, John, how is it that Microsoft's still making so much money?
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:16.600]   Okay.
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:18.600]   I know what you're trying to do here.
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.760]   Oh, that's good.
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:25.720]   I made my points.
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:29.040]   How is it Microsoft's doing so well then?
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:31.200]   That would take a while and I don't think this is the Microsoft-
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.200]   Is it?
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.200]   Yeah, well, isn't it?
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.200]   It's not an article you've got to start saying-
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.200]   It used to be the Twitter show.
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.200]   I know.
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:37.200]   It's whatever it's hot.
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.200]   Alright, alright.
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:39.200]   We're going to take a break.
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.200]   We're going to come back.
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.200]   Story number two.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.200]   Why Amazon?
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.200]   Sorry.
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.200]   Face Palm.
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.200]   What?
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:48.000]   It's all about the whole segment, a whole block.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   It's voted to one story.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   It wasn't even a story.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.240]   We were just arguing about whether or not Leo thinks Microsoft is cool.
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:57.240]   It's not about coolness.
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:58.600]   I think Microsoft is very cool.
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:02.000]   Wow, this is going to be the craziest show ever because I am like the nicest person
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   here.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   It's not about coolness.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   It's so unusual.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   It's about coolness.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.680]   I think that it's time to start to wake up and stop enabling Microsoft.
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:11.680]   This is a very poorly run company.
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:15.840]   A company that can't manage its corporate communications, that can't seem to strategize
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.280]   its way out of a paper bag.
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:23.640]   The Zoom, Windows 8 fiasco, Windows Phone 8 fiasco, it's fiasco after fiasco.
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:28.520]   Sure, you're a mega company with lots of revenue because of historic success.
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:33.760]   But in the long run, you cannot continue to misrun this company and survive.
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.640]   Now here's the problem I see.
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:38.880]   What are you going to replace Ballmer with?
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:41.760]   Oh, pick a name out of a bag, honey.
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.520]   I don't think it's that easy to...
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:49.600]   You can't just waltz in and run a $79 billion company.
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:50.600]   You can't just waltz in and run a $79 billion company.
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:53.600]   You can't just waltz in and run a $79 billion company.
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:54.600]   You know, I could do a great job.
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:55.600]   No, I think...
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:58.440]   And this is what you said for years, John, and really you're arguing against me and counter
[00:22:58.440 --> 00:22:59.440]   argument.
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.440]   I can't tell which argument you guys are.
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:02.440]   You said this for years.
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:03.760]   But the Microsoft really needs to be divided up.
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.080]   They are multiple companies.
[00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:06.080]   Four companies.
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:07.080]   And that's the real problem.
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:10.200]   They never succeed as long as they're warring within each other.
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.480]   They need to have an Xbox entertainment media company.
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.760]   They need to have a desktop operating systems company.
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:15.760]   Enterprise company.
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.120]   Enterprise middleware company.
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:21.400]   I mean, they have good products in all these categories.
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:24.760]   By the way, I'm interested that we had a great interview, which if you haven't seen it on
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:30.520]   triangulation on Wednesday, with Nolan Bushnell, founder of Atari, a guy who pays close attention
[00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:35.920]   to the gaming business, as you might imagine, who he says, "You know, the consoles are tapped
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:36.920]   out.
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:41.760]   You can see, even though Microsoft has announced it's doing an Xbox, whatever, 720 next year,
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.400]   he said, "You got as far as you can go with consoles."
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.400]   Yeah, I think a lot of people...
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:46.400]   A lot of people think that.
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:47.400]   Interesting point of view.
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:50.080]   And if that's true, that's bad news for Microsoft as well.
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:51.080]   That's a big part of their revenue.
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:53.680]   I'm going to try telling that to the hardcore gamers.
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.160]   They play on PCs now, don't they?
[00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:58.400]   Well, some of them do, and a lot of them play on consoles as well.
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:59.400]   Multiple consoles even.
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:05.120]   Well, Microsoft hopes to transition the Xbox into a home entertainment center that is used
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:06.120]   as a streaming center.
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:07.960]   Exactly why, by the way.
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:09.480]   They see the writing on the wall.
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:10.880]   And they'll probably buy Roku.
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:11.880]   There's a prediction for it.
[00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:12.880]   There's a good one.
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:13.880]   Well, I like that one.
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:14.880]   Roku's nice thing to do.
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:15.880]   All right, story two coming up.
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:18.120]   Why Amazon is about to devour the world.
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:19.120]   I like this.
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:22.720]   Oh, and I got one on this one too that will blow your mind.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:23.720]   I can't wait.
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:24.720]   People, I can't wait.
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:25.720]   But first a word from our friends.
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:29.640]   It's Citrix, the folks who do the great go-to meeting.
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:31.000]   All it takes is they...
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.520]   Well, you know, it's summertime, right?
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:33.520]   Everybody's away.
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:34.520]   They're on vacation.
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:35.520]   They're traveling.
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:36.840]   They've worked a little bit early.
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:38.080]   Those meetings still have to happen.
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:43.480]   You know, I got a little flak because I've missed two, three, maybe four staff meetings
[00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:44.480]   in a row.
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:45.760]   Get my life in the summertime.
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:46.760]   I want to go.
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:48.600]   I want to, you know, so go to meeting.
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:49.600]   That's the solution.
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:51.480]   In fact, that's what I think we're going to do from now on.
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:52.480]   Go to meeting.
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:56.880]   Of course, you've known for years online meetings software that lets you share your screen with
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:57.880]   people.
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:01.440]   Now you can share your video to the HD faces on go-to meeting.
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.440]   Fantastic.
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:06.320]   All you need is a webcam and you just click and you'll turn that online meeting into
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:09.120]   a high definition video conference.
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:10.120]   Video looks fantastic.
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:11.120]   And here's the best part.
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.640]   You can use an iPad, the camera, the audio.
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:17.200]   You don't even need a phone line to not only join a conference but to broadcast your video
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:22.120]   back so your attendees can meet in the way that's most convenient to them no matter where
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:23.120]   they are.
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:24.520]   It is very cool.
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:27.080]   I just, you know what, I invite you to try it.
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:29.920]   Show your colleagues, your clients, your boss.

[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:46.560]   They have not yet put the camera in the iPhone app.
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.800]   I think that's just a matter of time.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:52.640]   Face to face meetings when they're a world away.
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.640]   It's go-to meeting.com.

[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:02.280]   It's really beautiful video.
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:06.320]   Now John has gotten up and gone away so what do we think?
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:07.320]   What should we do?
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:08.320]   Short sheet is a chair.
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:09.320]   Whoopee cushion.
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:10.320]   Whoopee cushion.
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:12.960]   Maybe we could, I don't know.
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:16.680]   Jalapenos in his aquavit or whatever this is that we're drinking.
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:17.680]   What do you think?
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:18.680]   I don't know.
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:19.680]   You don't like it?
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:22.440]   I get nervous that he never know how he's going to react.
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:23.440]   That's the problem.
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:25.440]   He might totally freak out.
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.440]   See that smile?
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.880]   See how genuine that was?
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:32.280]   And he's back.
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:33.520]   Channeldivoract.com.
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:34.960]   Jolie Odell from Venture Beat.
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:35.960]   Great to have you.
[00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:36.960]   Nothing to be here.
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.960]   Even though you didn't bring us slutty brownies I'm happy.
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:39.960]   What have?
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:40.960]   What have?
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:41.960]   Now you're going to complain.
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:42.960]   And the fabulous Becky Worley.
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:44.640]   I'm going to say I'm from Yahoo now.
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:46.800]   Oh yeah, you know I should give you credit for Yahoo.
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:47.800]   Yeah I do.
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:48.800]   What do you do at Yahoo?
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:49.800]   What do you do at Yahoo?
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:52.840]   I am the Martha Stewart of Technology is what I've been dubbed as.
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:53.840]   Yeah.
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:54.840]   Do you have any sense?
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:55.840]   I mean you're not, you're a contractor.
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:56.840]   You're not an employee.
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:58.400]   I don't speak for Yahoo but I have lots of good thoughts about that.
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:26:59.400]   Do you have a sense?
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:02.040]   I mean the CEO hunt has just gone down.
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:04.560]   I understand they used stack ranking there too.
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:05.560]   Seriously.
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:06.560]   Oh God.
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:07.560]   I have never heard of that.
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.560]   I've never heard of that in the trenches.
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:09.560]   Do me a favor.
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:10.560]   I've never heard of that.
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:11.560]   Ask around.
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:12.560]   Ask around.
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:13.760]   But yeah no the CEO thing's going interesting.
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:16.240]   Ross Levinson's there right now and he's a good guy.
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:17.720]   He's going to get the job isn't he?
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:18.720]   I hope so.
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:19.720]   Who was the guy who said me?
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:20.720]   I don't really want.
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:21.720]   Jason Kalar.
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:24.640]   But the funny thing is if he'd taken the job then who would be a good candidate for
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:25.640]   his job?
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:26.640]   Ross Levinson.
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:27.640]   Oh you're funny.
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:29.920]   He's CEO musical chairs.
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:32.080]   Where's he the CEO?
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:33.080]   Kalar.
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:34.080]   Hulu.
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:35.080]   Yeah.
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.080]   Hulu.
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:37.080]   Yeah.
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:38.880]   No I mean listen everybody loves to bang.
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.120]   When you said who did you were you thinking?
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:42.120]   Hulu.
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:43.120]   Okay.
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:44.120]   It wasn't.
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:46.120]   It's the premier of China who?
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:48.560]   Who was on it first?
[00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:52.120]   No I mean listen Yahoo has problems but Yahoo news.
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:53.120]   I love it.
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.120]   I love working there.
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:55.280]   It serves people's needs.
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:59.840]   It may not serve the type of people who always want to write about tech and be on the cutting
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:01.400]   edge but the numbers are there.
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:02.400]   It's a fire hose.
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:03.400]   I love it.
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:04.400]   And change your password.
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:05.400]   Yeah.
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.160]   How many passwords is that?
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:10.520]   450,000 a million on fan droid.
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:12.520]   Where else did we see a big breach this week?
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:13.520]   Bunch.
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:14.520]   There were a bunch.
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:18.000]   And these people are what's sad besides the fact that they're our breaches is they're
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.040]   not storing these in any secure fashion.
[00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:23.080]   Yeah it seemed to care.
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:24.840]   It seemed to end six and a half million passwords.
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:28.600]   Yahoo 450,000 passwords.
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:30.600]   It just goes on and on.
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.080]   Back to Sony a year ago.
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.080]   I know.
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:35.160]   Change your password as soon as you hear of a breach.
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:36.160]   On every side.
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:39.080]   Well you should be using something like one password to manage your passwords like an
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:40.080]   adult.
[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:42.760]   And do not only adults use one pass.
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:43.760]   It's never true.
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.560]   And probably the kids do better.
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:48.480]   And then don't use the same password on a bunch of sites because if one site gets hacked
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:49.480]   then you're in.
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:50.480]   Oh that's good.
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:51.480]   Unless you don't care.
[00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:55.240]   I have high security, mid security, low security passwords.
[00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:56.240]   Oh brother.
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:57.680]   I have a system John.
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:02.320]   And then I use password stacking which is Steve's password stacking.
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:03.320]   The symbol stack.
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:04.320]   Oh yeah that's good.
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:05.320]   Yeah.
[00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:06.320]   Yeah.
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:07.320]   Haystack.
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:08.320]   Yeah.
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:09.320]   Password haystack.
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:10.320]   So actually this is a good technique.
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:11.400]   So you have a password for a site whatever it is.
[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:15.280]   And then you pad it because it turns out length is very critical and the ability to brute force
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:16.280]   passwords.
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:17.480]   And your pad could be standardized.
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:20.600]   You could it could be a zip code interspersed with commas.
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:22.240]   Although symbols are best.
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:23.800]   Symbols are very good.
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:24.800]   Yeah.
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:25.800]   Yeah.
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:26.800]   Numbers not as good because the variables are less.
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:27.800]   They're fewer.
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:28.800]   Yeah.
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:32.840]   So the best is like a like percent sign, dollar sign, A, B, three.
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:33.840]   Right.
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:34.840]   Right.
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:35.840]   Bracket.
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:36.840]   So.
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:37.840]   And that's a good example of Yahoo.
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:41.200]   So I took Steve's research on haystacking or what do you call it?
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.200]   Password haystacking.
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:45.120]   Turned it into one of my Yahoo episodes.
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:47.960]   Cited security now and we did two million views.
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:48.960]   Wow.
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:49.960]   Yeah.
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:50.960]   And that's the difference.
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:51.960]   That's what Yahoo is.
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:52.960]   Yeah.
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:53.960]   We got about 20,000.
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:54.960]   Yeah.
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:58.840]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:01.440]   So Farhad Manju writing in Slate.
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:07.240]   I know I love it on Wednesday talks about the Amazon's new strategy, which I think I think
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:08.720]   that he's got it right on John.
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:10.200]   Let me see if this is what you were talking about.
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:11.200]   Yeah.
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.200]   Same.
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.200]   This is what's going to happen.
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:18.040]   So Amazon got a big fight with the state of California last year because of course Amazon
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:19.280]   doesn't collect sales tax.
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:21.160]   Now I should point this out.
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:22.840]   Some people say doesn't charge sales tax.
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:23.840]   They don't collect it.
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:27.680]   You still owe sales tax on all purchases in California and most states.
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:28.680]   Yes.
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:29.680]   You owe what's called a use tax.
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:33.400]   You're supposed to April 15th tell California how much you spent.
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:34.400]   Right.
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.200]   And apparently nobody's ever was always spent nothing.
[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:37.200]   That's amazing.
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:38.920]   And I don't know.
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:42.040]   Maybe there's no enforcement or maybe it's just impossible to enforce.
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:43.440]   I do say I do too.
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.440]   Yeah.
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:45.440]   I do too.
[00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:46.440]   Yeah.
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:47.440]   Yeah.
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:48.440]   Because I'm an honest person.
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:50.880]   They just lose billions they think anyway.
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:52.480]   They think they don't know.
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:56.320]   So last year they passed a bill Jerry Brown signed it into law saying, Oh, guess what?
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:57.320]   Yahoo.
[00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:58.320]   You'll pay.
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:30:59.320]   You'll collect.
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:00.320]   See, I did it.
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:02.160]   It's not that Yahoo's Amazon's paying taxes.
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:05.280]   They're merely collecting our tax from us.
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:08.800]   But the brick and mortar retailers have long felt this is an unfair advantage.
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:10.320]   And they're the ones behind this.
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:12.000]   They're the ones who harass the stages.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.680]   You guys, it's unfair to us.
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:15.680]   So guess what?
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:16.680]   Big mistake.
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:18.280]   Unintended consequence here.
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:21.360]   So Amazon made a deal with the state of California.
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:22.360]   All right.
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:27.560]   We're going to not collect sales tax for another year, but in a year we will.
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:33.520]   And meanwhile, they're making lemon out of this lemonade or is it lemonade out of this
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:34.520]   lemon?
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:35.520]   Yeah, the latter.
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:42.120]   They're making slutty brownies out of this lemon because they are saying, Well, if we're
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:45.200]   going to be doing business in a state and have to collect sales tax, we might as well
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:46.840]   do business in the state.
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:50.680]   And they are building distribution centers and all the major metros.
[00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:51.680]   And guess what?
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:57.000]   Amazon is going to start next day and sometimes same day delivery for Amazon customers.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   Right.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.760]   And which I mean, if you, I'm sure the prime people, you'll be getting some amazing.
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:02.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:07.160]   So now instead of having to go to Walmart, this is the point.
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:08.800]   I did it this weekend birthday party.
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:10.160]   I got to have the birthday present.
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:11.160]   Destroy Walmart.
[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:12.160]   That's your target.
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:14.600]   They're the big jerks that made this happen.
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:15.600]   Okay, by me.
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:21.920]   So what apparently has the realization that Amazon has made is that no, maybe it's not
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:26.440]   the fact that we don't charge sales tax that people cause people to use as it's the fact
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:27.440]   that we're convenient.
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:29.360]   And if we don't like it, then it's better.
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:30.360]   The selections better.
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:31.880]   The prices are good and we're convenient.
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:34.320]   If you could get to deliver, what is the advantage brick and mortar has?
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:35.320]   I get it now.
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:36.320]   I go there.
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:37.320]   I pick it up, but I have to get my car.
[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:38.320]   I have to drive to Walmart.
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:39.320]   You have to put on hands.
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:40.320]   I have to run hands.
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:41.720]   Forget that note.
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:44.680]   What if I could get it soon?
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:45.680]   It's pants.
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:47.160]   Sands pants.
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:50.800]   And so by putting these distribution centers in urban metrics, they're already doing this,
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:52.920]   by the way, I don't know if Farhad pointed this out and it's happened to me.
[00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:53.920]   Maybe it's happened to you.
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:54.920]   I'm a prime guy.
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:56.360]   I'm getting stuff next day.
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:57.560]   Just just shows up.
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:32:59.200]   It just shows up half the time.
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.200]   Yeah.
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:02.200]   All of a sudden it's starting to arrive right away.
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:04.000]   Is there a distribution center around here?
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   Yeah, to pay.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.240]   There's one in Hayward and then the big one.
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:10.200]   It's a tax down by the way.
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:11.200]   No tax state.
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.200]   Yeah.
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:14.320]   So they're again, what they do is they want to be in brick and mortar.
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:17.400]   They want to have a physical presence in states that don't charge sales tax.
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:19.160]   Actually, Nevada does charge sales tax.
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:20.720]   I'm not sure what the deal is.
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:23.480]   No, there's inventory tax in Arizona.
[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:26.320]   So there's a big ones are in Arizona.
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:28.080]   That's the big, big ones are there.
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:29.080]   I've been to those.
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:30.080]   They have six in Phoenix.
[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:32.720]   Probably because it's near a hub for FedEx or UPS.
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:33.720]   Yeah.
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:34.720]   Yeah.
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:35.720]   I mean, they are 50 football fields.
[00:33:35.720 --> 00:33:36.720]   Huge.
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:38.480]   And can I ask one question about this?
[00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:39.480]   Thick and packed.
[00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:40.720]   Do they have to?
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:43.320]   What concessions are they trying to get from the states?
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:44.320]   No, they've given up.
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:45.320]   They've given up.
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:46.320]   They've given up.
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:47.320]   They've said, all right.
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:51.840]   Maybe it isn't that we are 9% cheaper in California because that's our sales tax rate
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:53.320]   8.75%.
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:54.320]   Maybe it's convenience.
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:59.840]   Well, if we could make it more convenient, still offer better selection, but make it more
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:02.840]   convenient, would we compete favorably against brick and mortar?
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:04.720]   And I think the answer is absolute.
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:06.120]   And inventory.
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:09.280]   It's total inventory and certainty of it being there without having to call.
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:15.600]   Mark has said, what if I could say in the morning order laptop in my office, pay in the morning,
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:18.800]   pay five bucks and have it when I get home at my house?
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:23.040]   Isn't that better than getting in the car driving down to a retailer and buying it?
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:26.760]   Yeah, especially if you ever take a look at that web page about the horrible nightmarish
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:28.200]   people that shop at Walmart.
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:29.200]   I love that thing.
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.040]   It's beautiful, isn't it?
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.040]   It's unbelievable.
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:35.040]   So pants in a tramp stamp gets me a free time.
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.040]   Yeah.
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:37.040]   And a muffin top.
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.960]   But I don't think this is any.
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:39.960]   I try to.
[00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:41.960]   No, you have no.
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:45.560]   Sometimes my shirts are too short and it's not my fault.
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:47.240]   Oh, speaking of words.
[00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:49.520]   Just stop shopping it for ever 21 Leo.
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:50.520]   Problem solved.
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:51.520]   You know, that's true.
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:52.520]   You only have one problem.
[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:55.120]   We talk about this every time and it's that MPAL.
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:59.560]   It's that your pants, your male pattern ass loss and your pants go down too far.
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:01.480]   And then pattern ass loss.
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:02.680]   And by the way, this happened to me.
[00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:04.480]   I'm having this conversation with some guy.
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:06.480]   I'm having this conversation with some guy.
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:07.480]   I'm sorry.
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:08.480]   I'm sorry.
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:09.480]   I'm sorry.
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:11.840]   And for those of you watching an audio, nothing is happening now.
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:12.840]   Okay.
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:13.840]   But I'm just going to say that.
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:14.840]   You're going to.
[00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:15.840]   That is one.
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:16.840]   You know what?
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:17.840]   Wait, hold on a sec.
[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:18.840]   I'm going to.
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:19.840]   Look at this.
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:20.840]   This is this.
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:21.840]   You've gotten some back.
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:22.840]   He's wearing pads.
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:23.840]   It's reversible.
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:24.840]   I'm not kidding you.
[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:25.840]   Now the show goes downhill.
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:27.080]   You have gotten some back.
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:29.640]   Unfortunately, you also besides MPAL.
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:31.640]   Now you have to let him steal your brush.
[00:35:31.640 --> 00:35:32.640]   He's not included.
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:36.640]   Unfortunately, you coined the term MPAL, but you coined another term.
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:37.640]   Oh no.
[00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:38.640]   Waddle, waddle, paddle.
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:45.640]   Oh, that was the natural result of MPAL was Leah would walk, walk, and then yank him
[00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:46.640]   up.
[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:47.640]   Yeah.
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:50.360]   It's kind of like a 17-year-old with her prom dress.
[00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:54.560]   So now my entire staff says that.
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:58.800]   By the way, this is the conversation I had with Ross Levinson the first time I met him.
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:35:59.800]   Who?
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:00.800]   Ross Levinson from Yahoo.
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:01.800]   I'm talking about something.
[00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:02.800]   Ross Levinson has this problem?
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:03.800]   No.
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:04.800]   Some guy walks up to me.
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:08.040]   And it's the conversation strangely starts talking about something else.
[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:14.240]   I start talking about MPAL and then my boss hits me and says, "Have you met Ross Levinson?"
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:15.240]   CEO.
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:19.120]   You know, he should have a sign around his neck.
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:22.160]   I'm the CEO, Biotch or something like that.
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:23.160]   Oh God.
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:24.160]   Because that's embarrassing.
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:25.880]   CEO should not sneak around.
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:26.880]   No.
[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:30.520]   I do not think this Amazon strategy was a short term or just a realization.
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:33.160]   And that goes back to the acquisition of the EVA systems.
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:34.160]   Kiva, you're right.
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:36.160]   Because you're on top of that.
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.160]   You're absolutely.
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:38.160]   What is Kiva?
[00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:42.800]   So Kiva is a robotics picking program or system whereby they can increase the speed
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:43.800]   of the pick.
[00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:50.720]   So the way these warehouses work is that you've got bins on high shelves and all these bins
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:58.600]   are RFID or they're barcoded and people go through with big sleds and they pick based
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:00.400]   on orders that come in.
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:05.440]   So what Kiva systems does is they input orders and it's almost like the traveling salesman
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:06.440]   algorithm.
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:09.600]   Do you remember this where you would try and figure out what the fastest route was as you
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:10.800]   went and made all your calls?
[00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.640]   So these little robots are very efficient.
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:14.280]   Kiva systems just figured it out.
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:15.280]   Right.
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:16.480]   You mean they don't use humans?
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:17.480]   They do now.
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:18.480]   There's a mix.
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:19.480]   You can see it.
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:20.480]   Go to kivasystems.com.
[00:37:20.480 --> 00:37:21.480]   Well we're watching right now.
[00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:22.480]   We're watching these systems work.
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:23.480]   My gut instinct is...
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:24.480]   They're like little room buzz.
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:27.120]   They're like little room buzz underneath giant pallets.
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:28.120]   Yeah.
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:29.920]   Christ, that's creepy looking isn't it?
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:32.120]   So this is how an Amazon warehouse works?
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:34.840]   Not the ones that I've seen because they aren't like this and I bet they don't have
[00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:37.440]   robotics and people working side by side.
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:39.600]   These new ones are supposed to be loaded with this stuff.
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:40.600]   Right.
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:42.080]   And so this is... it's called picking.
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:46.360]   Picking is what takes so much time because the people have to go pick the bins, pick
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:47.720]   from the bins.
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:48.720]   And so...
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:50.000]   It also costs money because humans are expensive.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   This is a zap of hands.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   Right.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:53.680]   And it has a lot of margin of error.
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:59.600]   Because you think you're picking the blue smalls but actually you pick the turquoise mediums.
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:01.200]   So these robots never make a mistake.
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:03.160]   Oh, that's not necessarily true but I think it's...
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:05.720]   Well, something gets a load of batch wrong and the same thing.
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:06.720]   But you're right.
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:07.720]   Get humans out of the loop.
[00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:08.720]   You're probably going to...
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:12.000]   I have to admit, they're very rarely are errors in my online purchases.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.720]   I've never had an Amazon error ever.
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:14.720]   I don't think I've ever had that.
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:15.720]   I buy a lot of stuff on Amazon.
[00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:16.720]   You're right.
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:17.960]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:21.760]   So Amazon has been all along strategizing.
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:27.960]   You know, during the tech bubble when companies were just dying because the stock market burst,
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:33.320]   Amazon was working at a loss for years building giant distribution facilities.
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:35.360]   These facilities in Arizona, for instance.
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:37.080]   And everybody said, "Oh, Amazon's crazy.
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:38.080]   What are they doing?"
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:41.520]   And of course, come a couple years later, they're geniuses.
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:44.200]   Why does Jeff Bezos not get the credit that we want?
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:45.200]   You know, this conversation about...
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.200]   Because he's goofy.
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:47.200]   Because he's goofy.
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:48.200]   He's goofy.
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:49.200]   I think that...
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:50.200]   Believe it or not, I think Leo's right.
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:51.200]   I know.
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:52.840]   And he looks like Kevin Spacey.
[00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:53.840]   Can you do his laugh?
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:54.840]   Leave him.
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:55.840]   No.
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:56.840]   I have to work on that.
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:57.840]   That would be good.
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:38:58.840]   That would be a copy.
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:02.480]   But I mean, you talk about a company that's had a long-term vision that's been...
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:03.480]   Here's the Daily Show.
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:04.480]   You know, the guys are genius.
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:05.480]   I mean, he deserves more credit.
[00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:06.480]   He deserves more credit.
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:07.480]   But it's unfortunate that the laughs...
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:09.480]   Just stay off the stage, though.
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:11.200]   That's my advice.
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:13.120]   This is from the Daily Show, I think.
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:14.120]   We're gonna...
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:15.120]   It's...
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:16.120]   Your business plan?
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:19.120]   Have you heard of it now?
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:20.120]   No.
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:21.120]   I like Jeff Bezos.
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:22.120]   What do you think?
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:23.120]   He's strange.
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:24.120]   This is...
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:25.120]   Ooh.
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:26.120]   Wow.
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:28.520]   I like it, because he's real.
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:30.000]   That's a real human.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   I know.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   I know.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.080]   There's a lot of real humans that don't laugh like that.
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:35.080]   I know.
[00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:36.080]   He's like...
[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:37.080]   There you go.
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:38.080]   And he rocks.
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:39.080]   And he laughs.
[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:40.080]   Yeah.
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.080]   He's like a Jack in the Box, isn't he?
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:42.080]   With the wrapping.
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:43.080]   It's actually...
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:44.080]   If it were in a horror...
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:45.080]   It would be terrifying.
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:46.080]   Oh, I'd be terrified.
[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:47.080]   Terrifying.
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:48.080]   It's like a...
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:50.760]   It's a little bit like a Howard Dean scream, which I'm now renaming the Robert Skowball.
[00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:51.760]   The Robert Skowball.
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:52.760]   Yeah.
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:53.760]   A very similar.
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:54.760]   A very freak out.
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:56.000]   So Amazon Brilliant.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   They bought Kiva.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   They bought...
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   This is not...
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   They bought the company.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   They own this, which means they could...
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   That's why...
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.880]   Zappos is an Amazon company, so they can continue to use it.
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:08.280]   But other companies like Walmart, for instance, might not be able to.
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:10.440]   If you're Walmart at this point, do you start looking at...
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:13.840]   Is it too late to look at an online strategy?
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:14.840]   Oh, are you serious?
[00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:17.000]   They've been doing that for ages, dear.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.320]   They have their whole Walmart Labs thing, which is their Borg-like entity for acquiring
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:23.640]   really clever startups that are doing interesting things.
[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:25.960]   And then they get these hella smart people.
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:29.880]   The last team, one of the last teams they acquired were these Node.js geniuses.
[00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:30.880]   Yeah.
[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:32.880]   So it's a whole thing.
[00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:37.160]   They have the intelligence and they have the technology and they're working on making
[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:41.080]   Walmart.com and especially the mobile side of that very profitable...
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:43.720]   I'm gonna say easy and somehow as cool as Amazon.
[00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:45.760]   I'm gonna say something I think I'm gonna regret.
[00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:46.760]   Here we go.
[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:47.920]   Oh, do it, do it.
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:50.080]   I think the people who shop at Walmart...
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:51.080]   Uh oh.
[00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:52.080]   That's a bad problem.
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:53.080]   No!
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:54.080]   Stop now!
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:56.080]   You know where I'm going with it.
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:41:00.760]   Okay, so I will help you qualify this in actual business terms.
[00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:05.320]   Walmart's smartest move they've made recently is buy online, pay in cash.
[00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:06.320]   Ooh!
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:07.480]   Yes, that was very interesting.
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:08.480]   Interesting.
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:11.720]   So because many of their customers don't have credit...
[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:13.960]   I think it's a high number.
[00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:14.960]   I think it's...
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:18.960]   We don't want to say bad things about Walmart shoppers.
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:21.200]   It's very classic, but I am very elitist in classics.
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:22.200]   You are.
[00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:23.200]   I think it's very expensive.
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:25.200]   And then Walmart went right there and they...
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:26.200]   They admitted it.
[00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:30.200]   They know their customer and they don't have credit.
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:31.200]   I shop at Walmart.
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:33.200]   I won't shop at Walmart.
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.200]   I refuse.
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:35.200]   That's funny, my wife is the same way.
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:37.200]   She refuses to even step foot into a Walmart.
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:38.200]   I have mixed...
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:40.280]   She says I refuse to step foot into this Walmart.
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:44.880]   I know the union issue is serious, but I also really like their sustainability practices.
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:45.880]   They are getting there.
[00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:46.880]   Okay.
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:47.880]   They are really doing good things.
[00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:48.880]   I find that.
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:52.400]   They are vendors to source their carbon footprint.
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:54.040]   They are working really hard on that stuff.
[00:41:54.040 --> 00:41:55.440]   I think that they are...
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:58.480]   I'm not morally opposed to everything about Walmart.
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:41:59.920]   And I think they know their customer.
[00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:01.920]   And I don't think that they should...
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:02.920]   There's a balloon...
[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:05.920]   Air coming out of this somewhere.
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:07.400]   I think they know their customer.
[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:08.920]   Why would they compete with Amazon?
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:10.720]   I watched The Unforgiven last night.
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:11.720]   Actually, it's Unforgiven.
[00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:12.720]   There's no the...
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:13.720]   Oh.
[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:14.720]   Clint Eastwood movie.
[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:15.720]   Great Western.
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:23.680]   And at one point, one of the characters says to Clint, "They're bad men.
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:25.920]   These people are bad guys.
[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:27.080]   They don't deserve to live."
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:32.480]   And Clint said, "All of us are."
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:33.480]   And so I am...
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:35.040]   Getting it down is not bad.
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:36.040]   You're right.
[00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:37.040]   We probably shouldn't throw stones.
[00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:38.040]   Because there's good that every...
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:39.040]   You should shoot six bullets.
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:40.040]   Only five?
[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:41.040]   I shoot five shots.
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:42.040]   Only six.
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:43.040]   No, no.
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:44.040]   You're right.
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:45.040]   No, you're right.
[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:46.040]   No, you're already.
[00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:47.040]   You're right.
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:49.400]   Well, I gotta tell you.
[00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:50.400]   I actually...
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:51.400]   I could do it.
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:52.400]   I used to be able to do it.
[00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:53.400]   It's been a long time.
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:54.400]   Okay, you may give me the perfect segue.
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:55.400]   Yeah.
[00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:56.720]   Apple, so bad.
[00:42:56.720 --> 00:42:57.720]   Not recycling.
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:58.720]   All right, you want to talk about EP?
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:42:59.720]   Because they backed off.
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:00.720]   I know.
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:01.720]   So set it up.
[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:02.720]   Set it up.
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:03.720]   Or you want to take a break.
[00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:04.720]   What are you doing?
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:05.720]   Let's take a break.
[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:06.720]   Okay.
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:07.720]   We'll get to story number three.
[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:08.720]   Oh, I'm good.
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:09.720]   Actually, there's a lot of stuff about Apple.
[00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:12.720]   For instance, Samsung not cool enough to copy Apple.
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:14.920]   Which is actually good news for Apple.
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:15.920]   I mean, for Amazon.
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:16.920]   Samsung.
[00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:17.920]   Which is weird.
[00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:19.680]   Apple admits we were wrong.
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:20.880]   Never happened before.
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:21.880]   Never happened.
[00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:22.880]   Yeah.
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:23.880]   Never happened again.
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:24.880]   Beginning of the end.
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:25.880]   Yeah.
[00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:26.880]   It's interesting.
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:27.880]   And a whole lot more coming up.
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:28.880]   Great tease.
[00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:30.280]   You know, you shouldn't do teases on podcasts.
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:31.280]   You know why?
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:32.680]   You just skip right through the end.
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:33.680]   Oh, no!
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:34.680]   No.
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:35.680]   I've learned this lesson.
[00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:38.400]   No, because you can't scrub that accurately with those fingers.
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:39.400]   I can't do it.
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:40.400]   I'm like, no.
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:42.400]   Didn't Apple put like a jump button?
[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:43.400]   And I think they did.
[00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:45.080]   And to podcast the podcast app.
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:46.080]   Isn't there a jump button now?
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:47.080]   We're not going to tell.
[00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:48.640]   Why tell people about that?
[00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:50.160]   What are you nuts?
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:52.640]   What is wrong with you?
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:53.640]   Just do that.
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:54.640]   Hi.
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:55.640]   My name's Leo LaPorte.
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:57.360]   And I'm suffering from M-Pau.
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:00.000]   Not anymore.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   You've been doing your squats.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.680]   You can tell, can't you?
[00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:03.680]   And lunges.
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:04.680]   Can you tell?
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:05.680]   That's my heart back.
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:06.680]   I mean, it's Pilates, baby.
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:07.680]   I know.
[00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:08.680]   I'm telling you.
[00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:09.680]   You have changed.
[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:11.280]   I have a way to reverse M-Pau.
[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:13.880]   I used to be so.
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:18.880]   That's why we do things like this instead of ads because then nobody dares jump.
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:21.640]   The ad today is for fresh books.
[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:22.640]   Do you know my fresh books?
[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:24.000]   Oh, I know about the fresh books.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   You do?
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   Because you've heard the ads.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   Well, you got it in voice.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.040]   Everybody, if you're a freelancer sometimes.
[00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:34.000]   And so the real thing was a pain for me.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.120]   I don't do it anymore because I have a company and I have people.
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:40.880]   But they've been paying for me for years, right after tech TV for about five years when
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:45.120]   I was basically freelancing was I always had to invoice into each month and it was
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:46.840]   just like, I don't want to do this.
[00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:47.840]   I would put it off.
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:48.840]   It was painful.
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:54.920]   And then Amber in 2004, Amber MacArthur told me about freshbooks.com, changed my world.
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:56.800]   And I'm not alone.
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:57.800]   Last time I checked, what is it?
[00:44:57.800 --> 00:44:58.800]   Is 50 million people?
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:00.640]   Something like so smart.
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:05.640]   You know, this colleague of mine at GMA, Tori Johnson, she's the workplace contributor.
[00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:09.520]   She advocates for women entrepreneurs and she loves fresh books.
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:13.040]   And she says, hey, you should not be spending your time on the bookkeeping.
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:15.760]   You should be spending your time innovating your company.
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:16.760]   Yeah.
[00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:19.720]   So if you go to freshbooks.com, you can find out about this.
[00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:23.400]   The whole idea is you use online invoicing.
[00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:24.400]   Makes it very simple.
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:27.680]   If you do time in hours, it's great because they have an iPhone app or a web app that
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:32.240]   will keep track of the time in hours and then put it right in the invoice.
[00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:35.760]   But the most important thing FreshBooks does is makes it easy to get paid.
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:39.360]   And you know, I think a lot of times your clients, it's not that they don't want to
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:40.560]   pay you.
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:44.640]   It's just that should be, they don't, the paid part is the same as you, it's the same
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:47.640]   PITA as invoicing.
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:50.560]   So collection is much faster, much easier.
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:52.360]   You don't have to worry about manual payment entry.
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:54.800]   The whole thing happens automatically.
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:46:00.280]   You get paid fast with online payments at freshbooks.com.
[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:01.280]   The invoice follow up.
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:02.280]   If you don't get paid is great.
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:06.400]   It can automatically every 30, 60, 90 days, whatever, set it up so that it automatically
[00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:10.160]   tickles them or whatever cattle primes them.
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:14.560]   The invoicing is very, very nice looking, very professional.
[00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:18.720]   You can set up and I like this recurring invoicing plus recurring payments.
[00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:22.600]   So if your client is up for it, this could be completely friction free.
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:27.680]   And this is why I used it because I was invoicing in the US and Canada and they actually do
[00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:29.600]   almost every country in the world.
[00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:30.720]   They do their currency.
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:35.280]   So it makes it so much easier to invoice in currency, international currencies, you bill
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:38.920]   across borders as easy as can be.
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:43.440]   And there are a few clients, fewer and fewer, but there are a few clients who still want
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:47.880]   those printed invoices for a fee, small fee, $1.39 invoice, freshbooks will print and mail
[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:50.160]   them to your clients, complete with a return envelope.
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:52.360]   So again, payment is easy.
[00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:53.360]   I want you to try it.
[00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:54.360]   Just visit freshbooks.com.
[00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:59.520]   They've got a really nice trial offer, 30 days of unlimited use, everything that works
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:03.680]   as many clients as you want, as many pays as you want.
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:07.000]   If you're a small business owner, this is absolutely fantastic.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:11.040]   And by the way, your accountant will love you at the end of the year because taxes are
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:13.080]   so much easier with freshbooks.
[00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:17.080]   Freshbooks.com, billing made painless.

[00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:21.520]   So you're done with the aquavit?
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:23.520]   I saw he took your actual...
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:24.520]   No, I...
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:25.520]   She's too tempted by it.
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:26.520]   I keep like ran...
[00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:27.520]   It's just...
[00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:28.520]   It's the Irish in me.
[00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:31.160]   Put my hand on it and then the next thing I know I'm drinking something.
[00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:32.560]   Yeah, yeah, I've seen you do this.
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:33.560]   This is how...
[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:35.640]   And by the way, I want to remind people that listen to the show I like to come in to see
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:40.160]   the studio live, if Jolie Odell is ever on the show booked in advance, come by just
[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:41.160]   to see her...
[00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:42.640]   She's always got some spectacular outfit on.
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:44.280]   Oh, it is so rocking it today.
[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:47.600]   You know, I described your outfit and I did not describe Jolie's, but I better not.
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:48.600]   Why don't you...
[00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:49.600]   I'll do.
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:50.600]   Becky Worley.
[00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:52.360]   Jolie is sporting a retro do...
[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:53.360]   I love it.
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:54.360]   It's Andrew's sister.
[00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:55.360]   Andrew's sister's.
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:57.280]   We were singing Mr. Senan.
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:04.760]   She has fabulous hot pink red lipstick and cat eye eyeliner that is just exceptional.
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:05.760]   It's what I wake up in the morning for.
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:09.000]   I said she's also like orange heels and she's got some really...
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   Four of five.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   Oh yeah.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   And apple bottom, apple bottoms.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   I noticed that when you came in.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   And a lot of apple bottoms jeans, girl.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   And there you go.
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   And you buddy want to get low.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   Just take a look.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   Next time it'll be a different outfit.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   Yes, it will.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   What are apple bottoms?
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:21.160]   What are apple bottoms?
[00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:24.080]   They're bottoms that accentuate not these M-PAL.
[00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:25.600]   Not these wool pal.
[00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:27.600]   Just make your bottoms happy.
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:29.480]   It's you, okay.
[00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:31.480]   So there's some question in the chat room.
[00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:34.680]   What M-PAL is, it's when you're back and then your butt goes concave.
[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:36.080]   It's male pattern at sloths.
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:37.080]   Right.
[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:39.080]   Apple bottoms do the exact opposite.
[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:42.240]   The back goes here and then baby got back.
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:43.240]   It goes out.
[00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:44.240]   Convets.
[00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:47.960]   You know what, if there's a market for ladies like me with apple bottom jeans, maybe there's
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:53.200]   a market for M-PAL figures and maybe you could make M-PAL jeans.
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:54.200]   You know what?
[00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:57.360]   I think that suggestion sounds terrible.
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:58.360]   Booty pop.
[00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:00.120]   There's a product for this.
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:01.440]   It's called Booty pop.
[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:02.440]   Yes.
[00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:03.680]   It's called Booty pop.
[00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:05.720]   I don't think they have it for men.
[00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:07.520]   Is it a prosthetic?
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:09.520]   It is a prosthetic or your...
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:12.280]   It's like a chicken cut look kind of like a chicken for your wrist.
[00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:13.280]   Okay, I'm sorry I brought this up.
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:14.280]   It is.
[00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:15.280]   It is.
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:16.280]   It's one of the worn people if you could get a shot.
[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:17.280]   Well you're hurting things.
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:18.280]   Everyone's learning.
[00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:19.280]   I'm not kidding you.
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:20.280]   This is said to me.
[00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:21.280]   Oh, you know what?
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:22.280]   These are apple bottom pants.
[00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:23.280]   That's one of the reasons they look so good.
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:25.280]   The padding like the drag queens do, you know?
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:26.280]   That's true.
[00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:27.280]   That's what you're writing here.
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:29.200]   We don't want to see this, Leo.
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:30.200]   No, these are the top half.
[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:31.200]   Oh, he's got extra zippers.
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:33.200]   Oh, Leo, you can't be wearing short pants.
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:34.200]   You're a grown man.
[00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:35.200]   Whoop, whoop.
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:37.120]   I got some gallibels for Leo.
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:40.960]   So I didn't realize you were British.
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:42.320]   Just call me Magic Mike.
[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:44.040]   One leg, just this row.
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:46.040]   Now you had a story about apple doing E-P.
[00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:47.040]   Let's do that.
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:48.040]   That'll be story number 2.5.
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:49.040]   That's right.
[00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:51.040]   Because story 3 is goodbye dig.
[00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:53.000]   Oh, yeah, let's get that in mind.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   Oh, yeah, this is a good one.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.360]   Okay, so just start with the numbers.
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:56.360]   So total--
[00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:57.840]   Grown men can't wear shorts.
[00:49:57.840 --> 00:49:58.840]   Mm-mm, okay.
[00:49:58.840 --> 00:49:59.840]   Did you know that fiance?
[00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:00.840]   He does.
[00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:01.840]   He knows that very well.
[00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:02.840]   I'm in agreement with her.
[00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:05.680]   I think a lot of these guys that wear, especially the some of these shorts that go kind of
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:08.120]   like are a little longer than bermutas.
[00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:09.120]   Yeah.
[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:10.120]   They look like dresses.
[00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:11.960]   90% of the time.
[00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:12.960]   It looks like there's a dress in there.
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:14.320]   You do know that Steve was next.
[00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:15.320]   Famous for wearing shorts.
[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:18.960]   Well, if you're a hacker, you can get away with all kinds of things.
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:23.360]   But if you are a man and you're not doing some sort of exertion type activity--
[00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:25.360]   Socks with sandals and shorts.
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:26.360]   Oh, no.
[00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:27.360]   No.
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:28.360]   I'm so preppy.
[00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:31.400]   I like the loafer with shorts, with the plaid shorts.
[00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:32.800]   I could see you, sporty.
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:33.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:34.800]   I'd be looking good.
[00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:35.800]   I'm new to shorts.
[00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:36.800]   I'm the guy.
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:37.800]   I'm that guy.
[00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:38.800]   I know.
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:39.800]   I can't put my pants legs back.
[00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:40.800]   Yeah.
[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:41.800]   Don't unzip these.
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:45.440]   Oh, wow, you do have a problem now.
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:46.440]   That's not a good sign.
[00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:49.760]   However, you just let it move over a 2 inches minimum.
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:54.240]   I'm going to make a new line of price to call podcast shorts.
[00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:55.240]   That's good.
[00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:56.240]   Yeah.
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:57.240]   I like magic.
[00:50:57.240 --> 00:50:58.240]   I like the concept.
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:50:59.240]   Well, wait.
[00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:00.400]   If it's a true podcast and you don't have any video, you don't need to be wearing pants
[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:01.400]   at all.
[00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:02.400]   Have you ever done that?
[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:03.400]   That's true.
[00:51:03.400 --> 00:51:04.400]   In fact, though.
[00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:06.040]   Remember when you streak the internet tonight set?
[00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:07.040]   That was awesome.
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:08.040]   You did?
[00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:09.040]   You actually real streak?
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:10.040]   That was nice.
[00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:11.040]   Full streak.
[00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:12.040]   Oh, I asked.
[00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:13.040]   Oh, damny streak.
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:14.040]   Oh, damny streak.
[00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:15.040]   So I can't do it.
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:16.040]   That's it like that.
[00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:18.040]   That's what money was put into dig.
[00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:19.040]   Oh, no, no.
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:20.040]   Let's do dig first.
[00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:21.040]   Yeah, we got to do dig.
[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:22.040]   You bought a big $45 million.
[00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:23.040]   Okay.
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:24.040]   So $45 million.
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:25.040]   $45 million.
[00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:28.040]   That's a lot of venture capital down the tubes.
[00:51:28.040 --> 00:51:30.040]   Put on the tubes.
[00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:33.400]   The first thing they did was they sold off the engineering staff to the Wall Street
[00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:35.040]   Journal, Washington Post.
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:37.840]   Well, this isn't like human and chattel.
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:39.440]   It was.
[00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:41.440]   That was what the weird thing was.
[00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:42.440]   I thought that too.
[00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:43.440]   Do you want to put this on?
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:44.440]   Yeah.
[00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:45.440]   Can you sell your engineering?
[00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:50.800]   I would recommend people read, even though Wikipedia's got mixed reviews.
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:55.760]   The Wikipedia article on dig showing all the little mistakes they made and everything
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:52:00.800]   they did, it was a classic example of a company having a vision and then deciding to listen
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:03.240]   to whatever the users told them to do and then doing it.
[00:52:03.240 --> 00:52:04.760]   Oh, it was the users fault.
[00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:07.000]   I believe it was the users fault.
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:10.800]   You know, actually, other commentaries this week was they didn't listen to the users.
[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:13.520]   No, you read that wiki thing and you'll see what happened.
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:17.120]   There's the power users, the ones who manipulated dig for their own advantage.
[00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:18.120]   That's right.
[00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:21.560]   Well, those users were the only thing that made dig worthwhile.
[00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:28.120]   The only reason dig was worth anything is because it channeled, you know, this huge firehose
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:32.960]   of viewers and eyeballs to the websites that displayed advertising and that made money.
[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:37.080]   So it was a very effed up model for doing business in the first place.
[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:39.280]   I don't think dig ever turned to profit on the shown.
[00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:42.920]   How is that different though than from Twitter, which in theory will make money on our,
[00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:43.920]   same thing's going to happen.
[00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:46.720]   It's not different or Facebook, which in theory makes money on our own.
[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:49.800]   No, it's quite different from Facebook because Facebook keeps you on the site and keeps you
[00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:51.360]   looking at their advertising.
[00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:53.160]   The purpose of dig was never to do that.
[00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:56.560]   So it was flawed as a business idea from the beginning.
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:57.560]   Now those power users.
[00:52:57.560 --> 00:53:03.480]   In defense of Kevin Rose, who's a good friend in an early Twit regular in defense, his idea
[00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:08.840]   was merely news would be better if the readers picked the stories.
[00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:12.480]   However, in fact, we want to start doing that with with a subreddit.
[00:53:12.480 --> 00:53:16.080]   You'd have to mention to somebody that it's so somebody just said, well, how could it
[00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:17.720]   be bad if it sold for half a billion?
[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:18.720]   Half a million.
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:20.520]   Half a million it sold for $500,000.
[00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:21.520]   No, that's $500,000.
[00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:24.240]   So the total was more like in completion.
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:26.600]   It was like 15 mil because they sold some of the hundred.
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:29.000]   Oh, it sold all the other assets that were sold to other patents.
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   Oh, this is interesting.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.400]   But they never recovered the 45.
[00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:32.880]   No, they didn't bought the patents.
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:33.880]   Right.
[00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:34.880]   We just found that out.
[00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:35.880]   That was kind of a surprise.
[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:36.880]   Yeah.
[00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:37.880]   And that was for several million.
[00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:43.960]   The total is we don't know, but something like 16 million out of 45 invested.
[00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:45.680]   Now you know who did fine on this is Kevin.
[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:46.680]   Good.
[00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:48.480]   Because he got out while the getting was good.
[00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:50.080]   And he took some money off the table.
[00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:55.440]   Occasionally this happens where a founder during an investment round can just say, I'll
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:58.960]   take that and he took several, I think he took several million.
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:02.920]   I don't know, but I think he took at least a million off the table during one of the last
[00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:03.920]   rounds.
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:07.520]   Now, the crazy thing to me is now, and I'm saying this, I'm meeting with Kevin next week.
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:09.320]   If I checked my email, right?
[00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:10.400]   I'm meeting with Kevin next week.
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:13.040]   The crazy thing is that this kid is not kid.
[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:14.040]   My age, he's a kid.
[00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:15.920]   You mean the $60 million kid?
[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:17.400]   Yeah, that kid.
[00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:18.400]   That's the problem.
[00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:19.400]   He's now working at Google Ventures.
[00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:20.400]   Yeah, I know.
[00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:21.400]   You know, as a partner.
[00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:22.400]   Green job.
[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:23.400]   Right.
[00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:27.080]   But it seems odd to me that, you know, what happened to Dig.
[00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:30.080]   I mean, we can say in all fairness that it tanked.
[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:33.520]   It tanked in every way that a website or business can tank.
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:39.000]   And now the $60 million, two thumbs up kid from the cover of Business Week is going
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:40.640]   to be a VC.
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:43.000]   This cover is the root of the problem.
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:49.120]   It quantified some made up value of the company and it made Kevin the poster child of Web
[00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:52.720]   2.0 and the expectations were too high.
[00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:54.000]   And it was too much, I think.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:57.360]   I mean, I think they had opportunity after opportunity to bail.
[00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:58.360]   I don't.
[00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:01.680]   Sarah Lacey wrote this article in typical Sarah Lacey style.
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:04.520]   It was June 26th, 4.55 AM.
[00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:07.120]   And Dick founder Kevin Rose was slugging back teeth.
[00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:08.120]   Oh, please stop.
[00:55:08.120 --> 00:55:12.040]   Trying to keep his eyes open as he drove his Volkswagen golf to Dig's headquarters above
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:14.720]   the offices of the Bay Guardian and Bittrero Hill.
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:18.120]   This was the day Rose would test everything.
[00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:24.520]   So now if you can only do it in your form, you should have something.
[00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:25.520]   But the truth.
[00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:26.920]   I can't.
[00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:31.640]   So the in perfect defense of Kevin.
[00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:34.440]   His original idea, I think, was fine.
[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:35.440]   He did it.
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:36.520]   Execution was excellent.
[00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:38.120]   I'm not sure what were wrong with Dick.
[00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:41.320]   I think I could take some blame because I was the one who told him that he should do
[00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:43.120]   Dig 4.
[00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:44.520]   And I have a shirt to prove it.
[00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:45.520]   Shame on you.
[00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:49.120]   But I think that in every step of the way, they actually try to do the right thing.
[00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:51.640]   Now, here's the interesting and the kind of sad point.
[00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:53.520]   There was.
[00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:56.160]   And I've heard this from a number of inside sources.
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:59.440]   At one point, Google was always going to buy it for $200 million.
[00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:01.000]   Yeah, we've heard that.
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:02.400]   And apparently it was a backup.
[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:05.400]   It was like if they didn't pick it up, somebody else, there was a backup guy.
[00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:08.800]   I think it was, yeah, who or somebody was going to give him a 150.
[00:56:08.800 --> 00:56:10.280]   So they could have gotten out of this thing.
[00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:14.120]   There are a bunch of these stories where, you know, a hot young startup gets offered
[00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:17.760]   insane amount of money by tech old Stern, and then they don't take it.
[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:19.560]   Hey, I remember the happens all the time.
[00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:20.560]   Jason, I remember.
[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:22.600]   I remember you might have even been here.
[00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:26.000]   It was during a twit, maybe one of the first few dozen.
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.560]   Kevin said, yeah, you know, because he'd already started Dig.
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:32.480]   He said, Calla Canis has offered me a million bucks for it.
[00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:36.000]   And he was agonizing over whether he should take it.
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:37.200]   And it turned out it wasn't a very good offer.
[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:38.200]   It was mostly stock.
[00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:39.200]   Yeah.
[00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:41.200]   And so he decided not to take it.
[00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:42.200]   Probably right.
[00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:44.240]   I don't know what Dig did wrong.
[00:56:44.240 --> 00:56:46.200]   Well, they listened to the users.
[00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:48.200]   I'm telling you, you got to read that wiki thing.
[00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:49.200]   I don't think there was any one thing.
[00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:50.200]   Yeah, it was just one thing.
[00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:51.200]   There's no one thing.
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:52.200]   That's really outlined well in the Wikipedia.
[00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:56.040]   The big mistake was not taking the first offer that came across their desk.
[00:56:56.040 --> 00:56:57.760]   By the way, they should have taken the money and run.
[00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:02.600]   It was during due diligence that Google declined to spend the money.
[00:57:02.600 --> 00:57:04.960]   So it wasn't the dig turned them down.
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:05.960]   Yeah.
[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:11.680]   There was an article in New York Times this weekend, Bernard Cusla, you know, green venture
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:13.200]   capitalist wrote this big thing.
[00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:16.440]   I thought it was Indian.
[00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:20.640]   Some people seem to think that getting acquired should be the highest aspiration for any entrepreneur
[00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:21.640]   in Silicon Valley.
[00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:22.640]   I disagree.
[00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:23.640]   I disagree vehemently.
[00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:26.720]   If you're not making money on your own, it should be.
[00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:29.920]   If you have an investor, you have to recover the money that they gave you.
[00:57:29.920 --> 00:57:32.840]   You have to make good on their investment in you.
[00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:37.120]   You're worth more if you don't make money because then the valuation is made up.
[00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:38.120]   Right.
[00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:40.320]   So that's not the way you have two choices.
[00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:42.320]   Either make a ton of money or make no money.
[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:45.280]   But where Dig went wrong is it only did okay.
[00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:49.680]   I don't feel bad for anybody and they moved the concept forward.
[00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:55.040]   That's what Hong Malek says in his post in memoriam, even in losing how Dig one.
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:56.040]   Oh, God.
[00:57:56.040 --> 00:58:00.680]   So this is the Silicon Valley fetishization of failure that I absolutely hate.
[00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:01.960]   It didn't win.
[00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:02.960]   It lost.
[00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:03.960]   It lost money.
[00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:04.960]   It lost people.
[00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:05.960]   They're jobs.
[00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:08.760]   It lost a lot of users, something that they counted on to find and perpetrate the news,
[00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:11.440]   even if the news is a cat video, Dig failed.
[00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:13.440]   And can we not just say it failed and that sucks?
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:14.440]   There's no winning.
[00:58:14.440 --> 00:58:16.560]   But what if you just say it provided a bridge?
[00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:17.960]   For what?
[00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:22.680]   It provided a bridge for people to curate news, the web for each other.
[00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:25.200]   But they didn't though because then you had the power users.
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:29.880]   And I know because I've worked with them before to get my own stories when I was working at
[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:31.400]   Read, Write, Web to Pop.
[00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:34.480]   Let me just to defend on, let me give you the story.
[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:38.400]   In the yards, if the yardstick of success is making money for the founders, employees,
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:43.200]   and the investors, then Dig will go down in the annals of web history as a colossal
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:44.200]   failure.
[00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:45.200]   Absolutely.
[00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:47.800]   Big loss for everybody, including those people who lost their jobs.
[00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:52.480]   However, if your yardstick of success is defined by a company or a product being a change
[00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:55.040]   agent and an instigator.
[00:58:55.040 --> 00:58:56.040]   It was a smashing success.
[00:58:56.040 --> 00:58:57.040]   That's all I'm trying to say.
[00:58:57.040 --> 00:58:59.040]   It was a kind of a smashing success.
[00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:01.440]   But would there have been a red and a without?
[00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:03.040]   I don't think they took what did they want to do.
[00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:06.080]   By the way, I don't know why, but there's a picture of me in this article.
[00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:07.920]   I didn't notice that until I scrolled down.
[00:59:07.920 --> 00:59:09.760]   Look at that core strength right there.
[00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:10.760]   Look at that core strength right there.
[00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:11.760]   Leo, crowd surfing.
[00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:13.840]   Look at the core strength you're displaying.
[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:15.160]   You can't do that as you have them now.
[00:59:15.160 --> 00:59:17.000]   That was the beginning of the reversal of MPa.
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.000]   I'm telling you.
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:19.000]   It was all about.
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   You have changed.
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:21.000]   It's because I was not willing to cop a feeling.
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   There we go.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.000]   Just really check.
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.000]   Thank you for doing that.
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:27.440]   It's the most exciting thing that's happened to me all week.
[00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:29.440]   You're out there.
[00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:31.960]   See, I feel like Reddit has been more of a change agent.
[00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:32.960]   I agree.
[00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:36.480]   I feel like Reddit took $100,000 in something too date.
[00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:37.480]   Reddit won.
[00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:42.120]   Reddit won because I think they realized, or whoever is running that show, Alexis is
[00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:43.680]   that the guy's name?
[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:46.240]   Realized that they're not there to make money.
[00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:47.240]   They're not there to take money.
[00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:48.400]   They're there to do what they do best.
[00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:50.520]   I think they got way away from that.
[00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:53.960]   It's very clear the difference between Dig and Reddit is its community, yes?
[00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:57.280]   One of the differences is that it can be shared.
[00:59:57.280 --> 00:59:58.400]   To me, it's a huge difference.
[00:59:58.400 --> 01:00:04.880]   When you go to Reddit, there's a definite sense of a real community there.
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:07.720]   The Dig community, well, I guess there was a community there.
[01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:08.720]   There was a very strong community there.
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:10.920]   It seemed like they were all about gaming it.
[01:00:10.920 --> 01:00:16.040]   How come, now maybe Chad should answer this, or how come Reddit doesn't have the gaming
[01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:17.040]   problem that Dig did?
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:18.040]   That was clearly a big problem.
[01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:21.040]   They must have some really strong anti-gaming mechanisms.
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:22.200]   Yes, no.
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:23.200]   I don't know.
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:27.480]   I mean, definitely there's a lot of people who want to get karma and they want their
[01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:30.920]   number to be higher than everyone else's number.
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:35.920]   That's different from spamming, which was basically what happened to Dig.
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:42.680]   But also, the sense of community in person seems to exist bigger on Reddit, where a comment
[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:49.160]   that's posted on a story can be sometimes better than the actual story.
[01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:51.400]   Because the comments are what's great.
[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:52.400]   Exactly.
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:53.720]   And I never found that on Dig.
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:57.200]   Kind of frankly the opposite of what happened on Dig.
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:58.200]   Right.
[01:00:58.200 --> 01:00:59.200]   You know what I think went wrong with Dig?
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:01.520]   Okay, this is completely personal.
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:04.480]   I think G4 is what went wrong with Dig.
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:05.480]   Interesting.
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:08.120]   That the problem was that Kevin, because he went to G4-
[01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:09.120]   This is a little bit off the wall.
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:10.120]   I know.
[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:11.120]   I think you're right.
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:12.120]   I know exactly where you're going.
[01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:13.640]   Because Kevin went to G4, he created an audience.
[01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:17.400]   I mean, Dig really was a Kevin Rose joint, right?
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:18.400]   Yeah.
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:19.400]   And-
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:20.400]   Called to personality.
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:23.560]   Personality, because he went to G4, became that audience.
[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:25.720]   Yeah, and it got very soft and warm.
[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:27.360]   In fact, it always made me really nervous.
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:31.400]   And one of the reasons we kind of downplayed a little bit, I never did anything with G4.
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:34.120]   We never, we kind of, you know, Kevin Pereira's never been on the show.
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:35.120]   Most of the G4 popular.
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:37.960]   I did not want that community to find us.
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:40.160]   It's 25 year old, more liquor.
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:41.160]   It's bros.
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:42.160]   Yeah.
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:43.160]   I didn't want the bros.
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:44.160]   Why not?
[01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:45.160]   Just more people listening.
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:46.160]   No.
[01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:47.160]   That's not your core demo.
[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:48.160]   And it's not, you're not going to resonate.
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:49.160]   No.
[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:50.160]   They won't listen then.
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:51.160]   No, I feel the same way.
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:54.280]   When you're building a community, you're building a community and it's about crafting
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:57.800]   a community and you want to bring in people that you want and not-
[01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:01.840]   Well, yeah, but you do that by the model of the show itself.
[01:02:01.840 --> 01:02:05.840]   I mean, those people will not come over because they're going to listen and go, "Ah, this
[01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:06.840]   is not for me."
[01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:07.840]   And they're just going to go back to G4.
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:11.440]   And look what Kevin did in, you know, Kevin's version of Twit was dignity.
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:12.440]   Right.
[01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:14.000]   That's for bros.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000]   That's all about a lot of heavy drinking.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:16.000]   But they drink and-
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.000]   Wait a minute.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000]   We're doing something.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000]   We're drinking refined.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.200]   Yeah, but this is- We're drinking alcohol feed.
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:22.200]   He drank beer.
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:23.200]   There's the difference.
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:24.200]   Right.
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:25.200]   It was cheap beer.
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:27.720]   But you know, what about just saying the fact that let's just call it, I mean, I don't
[01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:30.960]   know Kevin that well, so I'm going to say the thing that I think is what we're not saying
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:35.040]   is Kevin became a celebrity and stopped running the company-
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:36.040]   Well, that's true too.
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:38.240]   Maybe in a way that was leading in that place.
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:39.240]   I don't know.
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:40.240]   I don't know.
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:43.480]   I'm looking at his CV, if you will.
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:48.280]   I think he's the kind of founder that comes up with great ideas and gets the ball rolling.
[01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:51.280]   And I don't think he's the kind to follow through.
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:52.280]   He's not running that.
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:53.280]   He's not running that.
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:54.280]   He's always a Jay or- Jay Addison Randig.
[01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:55.280]   Yeah.
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:58.560]   And then it wasn't- Kevin came back as a CEO, but I don't know if Kevin was really-
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:02:59.720]   Well maybe he was though.
[01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:00.960]   He was pretty involved in this.
[01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:03.760]   But I think he gets really excited about starting things and that's why I think he'll
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:04.760]   make a terrific VC.
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:05.760]   Right.
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:07.360]   But so many CEOs have to be- He's going to be a good VC.
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:10.800]   If you look at his investments, he's going to be a great VC.
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:13.400]   Look at the list of Kevin Rose's investments including Twitter and Fab.
[01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:16.800]   Now when you can tell me, look at the list of Kevin Rose exits, then I'll say he's a
[01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:17.800]   great VC.
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:18.800]   I'm not counting this.
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:19.800]   He's got some exits.
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:20.800]   He's got some exits.
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:21.800]   Let me see if I can finance this.
[01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:24.800]   I'm going to couch my comment, does I think about it and refine it?
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:26.560]   Instagram is one of his exits by the way.
[01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:27.800]   Oh that was a fluke.
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:30.200]   Well, I'll take it.
[01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:34.680]   You know what he did really well is he advocated and he became a face for his company.
[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:36.480]   And as a celebrity that's a good thing.
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:37.480]   Twitter, four square.
[01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:38.480]   And-
[01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:40.480]   Twitter hasn't exited yet.
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:41.480]   Okay.
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:42.480]   And we don't know how much you can have any.
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:43.480]   OMG Pop.
[01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:44.480]   OMG Pop.
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:45.480]   Press something.
[01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:46.480]   Big exit.
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:47.480]   I'm also weren't making-
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:48.480]   Instagram.
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:49.480]   Big exit.
[01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:52.760]   I'm not saying that these are the greatest companies in the world, but I'm saying he's
[01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:53.760]   making money.
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:54.760]   No, I'm not saying that there's the worst companies in the world.
[01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:58.600]   I'm saying he's investing in companies that get extraordinarily lucky because they get
[01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:01.600]   bought before they make money because they're never going to make money.
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:02.600]   Okay.
[01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:04.040]   Go Walla Twitter, four square daily booth, N.G.
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:08.840]   MoCo, simple geo, three crowd, OMG Pop Square, Facebook, Chomp and Formspring.
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:09.840]   And G.
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:10.840]   MoCo, that's good.
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:15.920]   I heard one that has a revenue model that actually went public and I heard a bunch that
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:16.920]   got lucky exit.
[01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:20.080]   Well, if you're a venture capitalist, would you be looking for a revenue model or a big
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:21.080]   exit?
[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:22.080]   What are you looking for?
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:25.080]   Well, if I were a venture capitalist, I would have extremely different motivations.
[01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:27.720]   And I would make some of those bets like, "Oh, this is stupid, but they'll get acquired
[01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:28.720]   tomorrow.
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:29.720]   Let's invest in them."
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:30.720]   Exactly.
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:31.720]   That's the job, right?
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:32.720]   Yeah.
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:33.720]   How do I take my dollar and make it ten dollars?
[01:04:33.720 --> 01:04:36.360]   Well, I'm a little bit churn and froth-burn away.
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:40.520]   When will people like heaven stop getting lucky?
[01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:41.520]   That's a really good question.
[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:43.520]   You should ask him that when you interview him next week or not.
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:44.520]   Oh, yeah, that's a good one.
[01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:45.520]   You're asking that.
[01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:48.760]   No, let's take a look at this off of me and see what I can do.
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:49.760]   No, you ask him.
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:50.760]   I like it.
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:51.760]   This is hard.
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:56.920]   I did some research with my friend Leo LaPorte and your exit's blown.
[01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:59.720]   And Leo says you're a loser.
[01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:02.200]   What did you say to that?
[01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:03.200]   No, don't say that.
[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:04.200]   I love Kevin.
[01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:05.200]   Oh, this is good for him.
[01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:06.200]   Kevin is a good friend.
[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:07.200]   He's really likeable and I like the things that he does.
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:08.200]   No, Kevin is a great guy.
[01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:09.200]   He's a good friend.
[01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:10.200]   He does seem like a nice guy.
[01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:14.040]   And he was, in fact, a big part of the launch of Twit.
[01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:16.440]   We're going to take a break when we come back.
[01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:17.440]   Story four.
[01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:19.840]   But we don't know news this week.
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:21.640]   We're actually going to boring.
[01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:22.640]   We don't.
[01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:23.640]   We can make it up.
[01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:26.280]   I want to talk about Kate Middleton's wedding dress.
[01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:29.520]   And then we still have to do this EP because it's gone.
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:30.520]   It's gone.
[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:31.520]   It's a shorty.
[01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:32.520]   It's a shorty.
[01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:33.520]   We'll do it.
[01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:34.520]   Quicky, quicky, quicky, quicky.
[01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:35.520]   It's the EP.
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:36.520]   EP.
[01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:37.520]   This is the certification, the green certification that Apple.
[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:38.520]   Oh, that's very interesting.
[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:40.720]   They're gluing the machines together.
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:42.720]   It's all immediately they can't do it anymore.
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:43.720]   It's going to change.
[01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:44.720]   Stay tuned.
[01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:45.720]   Don't scrub.
[01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:46.720]   Read.
[01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:47.720]   Don't scrub.
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:48.720]   Read.
[01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:49.720]   No, you read.
[01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:50.720]   Oh, don't scrub.
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:51.720]   I'm not even producing you.
[01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:53.720]   I was like, have you felt my last lately?
[01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:54.720]   I did already.
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:55.720]   I know.
[01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:56.720]   At the end of the show, you'll feel mine.
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:57.720]   It'll be fine.
[01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:58.720]   Really?
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:05:59.720]   You might want to stay tuned.
[01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:01.720]   You're getting camera on this one.
[01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:02.720]   I know I will.
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:03.720]   Tell me about the video.
[01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:06.720]   How does this happen to me on this show all the time?
[01:06:06.720 --> 01:06:08.720]   You hear I have some more of this?
[01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:10.720]   No, I told you to put it over there.
[01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:13.400]   Who's the ad for?
[01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:14.720]   I'm not this kind of guy.
[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:16.720]   I'm really not.
[01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:18.040]   The nat is still here, by the way.
[01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:19.040]   I know.
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:20.040]   I keep catching it and it keeps escaping.
[01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:21.040]   He actually keeps heading to the--
[01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:22.040]   Maybe he likes equivutes.
[01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:23.040]   Maybe he's one of the ones that--
[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:24.040]   Maybe he's one of the ones that--
[01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:25.040]   You know you catch more flies with equivutes and with--
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:26.040]   That's that sure.
[01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:27.040]   --or you tee, apparently.
[01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:28.040]   Yes, I will agree with you on that.
[01:06:28.040 --> 01:06:29.040]   The brownies, though.
[01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:30.040]   The slutty brownies.
[01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:32.520]   The flies love it.
[01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:34.920]   Had you know that--
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:37.080]   Let me ask.
[01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:38.720]   I've never asked you this.
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:42.360]   Becky, do you have a place where you put your old gadgets?
[01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:44.600]   I have a shoe tree on the back of my office door
[01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:47.200]   that's filled with every old gadget and--
[01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:48.200]   A shoe tree.
[01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:49.200]   A shoe tree.
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:50.200]   It's like that thing and then it's got slots.
[01:06:50.200 --> 01:06:51.200]   Seven by 10.
[01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:52.200]   Seven by 10.
[01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:54.040]   And like you have probably what do you think in there?
[01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:55.040]   I don't know.
[01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:56.040]   Maybe 40 phones.
[01:06:56.040 --> 01:06:58.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:01.160]   The thing is, I would laugh except that every single person
[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:02.840]   in this audience has that.
[01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:06.280]   A drawer with a bunch of crap in it or a closet or in John's
[01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:08.960]   case, actually rental space.
[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:10.680]   I remember going to John's house.
[01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:11.680]   I'm sorry, John.
[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:12.680]   I have to tell this story.
[01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:13.680]   But it's always true.
[01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:16.680]   In the living room, I'm in John's house, fortrative solitude.
[01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:18.960]   And there was some file in the living room.
[01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:20.120]   I'm sure it's gone by now.
[01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:22.640]   This was like 15 years ago of software.
[01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:24.080]   And it was like-- it was yay high.
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:25.920]   It was like up to my nipples.
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:28.880]   It was this big of boxes.
[01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:29.360]   Yeah.
[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:29.880]   Yeah.
[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:30.880]   Those were the days.
[01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:33.000]   It was like a dump truck had pulled up and dumped software
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000]   in your living room.
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.440]   And then I'm looking.
[01:07:35.440 --> 01:07:36.280]   I'm going to the bathroom.
[01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:37.240]   And I'm going up the stairs.
[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:40.840]   And on every stoop, there's another laptop.
[01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:42.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:46.720]   Well, that's because you might want to stop and boot one of them.
[01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:49.960]   I mean, this is obviously occupational hazard
[01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:51.040]   of tech journalists.
[01:07:51.040 --> 01:07:53.360]   But even anybody listening to this show has a lot of stuff,
[01:07:53.360 --> 01:07:54.280]   I'm sure.
[01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:56.040]   And the real issue is, what do you do?
[01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:57.600]   You could just put it in a shoe tree,
[01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:00.040]   or you could actually sell it, get money, and buy new stuff.
[01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:03.200]   And that's what gazelle.com is all about.
[01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:06.440]   Gazelle is a great place to sell your iPhone, your Mac,
[01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:10.480]   your iPad, your iPod, your Apple, display your BlackBerry
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:11.360]   cell phone.
[01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:13.080]   You better quickly, quickly.
[01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:14.080]   Don't waste time.
[01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:15.160]   Go to gazelle.com.
[01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:16.520]   You lose value.
[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:20.240]   LG envy I have in the shoe tree 7.3 is--
[01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:22.720]   You know, they're not going to get to more--
[01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:23.360]   let's put it this way.
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:25.920]   They're not going to gain in value for another 100 years,
[01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:28.080]   then maybe, because it'll be an antique.
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:31.640]   HTC, Motorola, Samsung, Nokia cell phones.
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:34.160]   I have-- let me just check this out.
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:35.720]   So pick your product, get an offer.
[01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:38.240]   Now, these offers are good for 30 days, so this is nice.
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:40.720]   It gives you a chance to kind of mull it over,
[01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:43.840]   to say goodbye, to have a little ceremony.
[01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:46.440]   I have a Nokia N9.
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:47.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:48.520]   This was a nice-- I loved it.
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:48.960]   Yeah, it was a great phone.
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:49.840]   I haven't used it.
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:50.040]   It's unlocked.
[01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:50.960]   That was a major.
[01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:52.000]   It wasn't that like a big--
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:55.840]   Well, the Lumia 900 is based on it.
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:57.040]   Anyway, I liked this phone.
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:57.520]   Dump it.
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:08:58.680]   It's worth about $100.
[01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:00.000]   $200.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.160]   I could buy a new phone for that.
[01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:03.760]   Yeah, you should.
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:04.600]   I would dump it.
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:05.560]   So here's the deal.
[01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:06.680]   They pay the shipping.
[01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:08.480]   If anything over a buck, they pay the shipping.
[01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:10.240]   And they will wipe the data.
[01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:11.640]   You don't have to even think about it.
[01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:12.240]   They take care of it.
[01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:12.760]   Sure.
[01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:13.720]   Of course they do.
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:14.040]   Factory reset.
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:15.680]   Factory reset before you send it?
[01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:16.400]   You should do that.
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:19.240]   But honestly, they have data experts that
[01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:20.240]   will wipe all the data.
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:20.240]   No, I don't.
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:20.760]   So you can't forget--
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:21.080]   Can't forget people.
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:21.920]   This came in from who?
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:22.880]   The Eel Report.
[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:23.560]   No, no, no, no.
[01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:24.400]   There was an article in PC.
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:24.920]   Give it to Bill.
[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:26.480]   No, there was an article in PC World,
[01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:28.040]   and they looked at all the resellers.
[01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:29.280]   And Gazelle came back.
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:30.480]   The ones that they got from Gazelle
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:31.920]   had all the data wiped.
[01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:32.840]   No, I know.
[01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:33.360]   Yeah.
[01:09:33.360 --> 01:09:34.720]   I mean, I know these guys very well.
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:36.520]   Believe me, I'm not doing an ad for somebody who's not
[01:09:36.520 --> 01:09:36.960]   going to do that.
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:38.080]   No, I know.
[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:39.560]   And I'll tell you what.
[01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:40.240]   You get cash.
[01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:40.920]   You'll get PayPal.
[01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:42.400]   But you could also get an Amazon card.
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:44.680]   And I bet you would like this, because it's 5% bonus.
[01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:47.920]   So the $200 now is $210 on an Amazon card.
[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:49.480]   And believe me, I spent enough money in Amazon.
[01:09:49.480 --> 01:09:52.040]   That's as good as cash.
[01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:54.360]   Gazelle is amazing.
[01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:55.080]   So go there.
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:56.360]   Get a 30-day quote.
[01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:58.760]   It's guaranteed for 30 days.
[01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:02.800]   And if you don't sign that to take advantage of it, that's fine.
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:03.480]   I've done it before.
[01:10:03.480 --> 01:10:04.520]   I rated my product.
[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:06.080]   And when they got it, they said, now,
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:07.560]   do you think it's a little better than the way you rated it?
[01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:08.400]   They do that.
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:09.440]   Isn't that amazing?
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:10.680]   That, I don't understand.
[01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:11.160]   That's cool.
[01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:12.200]   That's like giving up money.
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:12.720]   But they do it.
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:14.600]   They will say, you know, it's in perfect condition.
[01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:15.920]   We're going to--
[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:17.840]   I get emails from people every day.
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:20.000]   They say, Gazelle actually upped the value,
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.680]   because it was in better condition than I thought.
[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:23.360]   Try it right now.
[01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:26.160]   Gazelle.com.
[01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:30.040]   And I think you're going to be very happy with the results.
[01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:30.880]   They've paid out.
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:31.840]   This I just found out.
[01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:36.640]   $50 million to over 300,000 customers.
[01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:38.360]   And they recycle.
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:39.600]   Well, that's what I'm saying.
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:41.880]   This is the right way to recycle.
[01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:42.720]   Nice segue.
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:43.560]   Don't throw it out.
[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:45.440]   Don't keep it in a chute tree.
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:46.400]   You're passing along.
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:47.800]   Somebody's going to use it.
[01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:48.480]   I love it.
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:50.320]   Gazelle.com.
[01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:51.640]   Kate Middleton.
[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:52.080]   Why?
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:57.840]   Now, I would not normally have picked this article,
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:10:59.320]   but I read it and I thought, you know what this is?
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:01.160]   I think he was just joking about this article.
[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:05.360]   So it's a Wikipedia issue, actually.
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:07.760]   So if you go to Wikipedia-- in theory,
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:09.720]   it's an encyclopedia of all information.
[01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:12.280]   But as you probably know, editors
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:16.320]   get to vote on what's an appropriate article.
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:19.080]   At Wikimania this year, Jimmy Wales is talking.
[01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:19.800]   And he says--
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:20.880]   Oh, no, no.
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:21.280]   Pardon me?
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:22.000]   Come on right now.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.360]   Yeah, going on right now.
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:26.000]   He says that there is a problem.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.880]   The community basically is male dominated, geek colored glasses.
[01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:33.520]   And so he gave as an example, we have over 100 articles
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:35.640]   on every Linux distribution.
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:37.720]   Many of them very obscure.
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:39.240]   And they're all there.
[01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:44.360]   But the day of the royal wedding,
[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:47.920]   a Wikipedia article about Kate Middleton's dress, which I would argue,
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:50.720]   is probably something that should be in an encyclopedia like this.
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:51.720]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:53.160]   Well, it's really throw back.
[01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:55.320]   There's everything in this thing, so it should be in there.
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:56.080]   It should be.
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:57.080]   OK, so this is the debate.
[01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:59.200]   There are a lot of fashion articles on Wikipedia,
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:01.120]   especially about historical fashion.
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:01.600]   Well, this is historic.
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:02.960]   Things like "Forcetry."
[01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:05.360]   There are a ton of articles on Wikipedia about "Forcetry."
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:06.400]   Yeah, because you know why.
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:06.920]   A bunch of guys.
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:07.560]   I know, right?
[01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:08.240]   So hot.
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:09.360]   So anyways, but the point is--
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:10.080]   That's why.
[01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:11.800]   No, the point is-- no, I don't think that's why.
[01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:12.640]   I think it's sexist.
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:13.240]   They're very--
[01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:13.720]   That's why.
[01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:16.000]   Only a small number of the editors are women.
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:16.640]   Yes.
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:18.080]   By the way, it was flagged for deletion.
[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:20.400]   OK, so because people don't care about one person's wedding
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:22.240]   dress, it's sexist because women are supposed to care
[01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:23.600]   about Kate Middleton's wedding dress.
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:24.880]   Now that's sexist, sir.
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:30.520]   Well, it's a forum that under-represents the population.
[01:12:30.520 --> 01:12:31.160]   As a whole.
[01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:31.640]   That's true.
[01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:32.280]   Is that fair?
[01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:34.600]   That's completely fair, yes.
[01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:36.600]   The one of the guys who said it should be deleted
[01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:37.360]   made this point.
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:39.800]   I really see this idea that keeping this article does
[01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:42.440]   something to remedy the gender imbalance here,
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:44.840]   to be facile at best and insulting at worst.
[01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:45.520]   That's what you should be saying.
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:47.440]   Because not all women are girly, not all women
[01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:48.760]   care about girly things.
[01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:51.240]   And I think when you have a 50/50 gender split,
[01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:55.280]   you could still argue a lot of that Kate Middleton's wedding
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:59.360]   dress in itself doesn't deserve its own Wikipedia article.
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:03.040]   So a Wikipedia Foundation fellow Sarah Sturch
[01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:06.120]   had a editathon at which women, some wiki veterans,
[01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:07.880]   some newbies, used Smithsonian records
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:10.960]   to create new articles on under-recognized female historic
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:12.000]   figures.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.400]   Oh, I like that.
[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:16.000]   Two of the fruits of their labor were rapidly nominated
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.080]   for deletion.
[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:20.080]   And after the decision was made to keep them both in tech,
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:21.440]   one was nominated again.
[01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:23.440]   This is one of the things that happens on Wikipedia
[01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:25.600]   as you get these battles over these pages.
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:26.480]   This should be deleted.
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:28.680]   Yeah, people should look at the history of these--
[01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:29.400]   It's fascinating.
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:29.680]   Isn't it?
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:30.880]   Yeah, the discussion.
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:34.680]   Well, the reason I'm asking this is because we have both
[01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:35.680]   Jolie and Becky here--
[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:37.400]   We have a 50/50 gender split on Twitter.
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:40.280]   Yeah, and I would very much like to know what your opinion is
[01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:40.960]   on this issue.
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:43.640]   I don't think I have the right to speak.
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:44.560]   You have the right to speak.
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:46.160]   You don't have the right to speak.
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:46.960]   That's interesting.
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:47.320]   Sure you do.
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:48.320]   It's never happened that way.
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:50.120]   You have plenty of rights to speak.
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:52.320]   I think that there's something to be said for the fact
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:55.920]   that this hasn't been a native environment for women
[01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:56.600]   who aren't geeky.
[01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:57.920]   It started in the geeky world.
[01:13:57.920 --> 01:13:59.720]   And I don't think it's necessarily
[01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:02.840]   had the same growth with women that it did with men.
[01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:05.120]   I think the geek world has just historically
[01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:07.800]   been hostile to women because women
[01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:09.560]   have often been hostile to geeks.
[01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:12.400]   And that's a huge generalization.
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:16.680]   But if you want to go back to the 1950s in the lab at MIT,
[01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:18.160]   why weren't women there?
[01:14:18.160 --> 01:14:21.160]   There is this great research that came to light this week
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:24.840]   that I first heard about talking about stereotype threat.
[01:14:24.840 --> 01:14:25.600]   Yes, I saw that.
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:28.560]   And the concept with stereotype threat
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:31.320]   is that-- and basically, this research
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:34.440]   shows that women are not taking to science careers,
[01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:37.440]   not taking to traditionally technology-based
[01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:42.080]   either social environments or careers or studying,
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:45.040]   not so much because of the old problem, which was, well,
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:47.920]   the ladies can't do the science or ladies
[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:49.480]   can't do the technology.
[01:14:49.480 --> 01:14:53.280]   Which, by the way, Larry Summers, president of Harvard,
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:55.720]   famously said, well, women aren't good at math.
[01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:57.680]   But look who he mentored.
[01:14:57.680 --> 01:14:58.040]   Who?
[01:14:58.040 --> 01:14:59.080]   Cheryl Sandberg.
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:14:59.440]   Oh.
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:00.240]   Damn right.
[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:01.120]   There you go.
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:03.640]   So I'm not 100% sure that that--
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:05.120]   How good is she at math?
[01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:05.960]   That's a great question.
[01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:07.560]   She's probably good at balancing books.
[01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:08.560]   Yeah.
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:10.800]   So the whole concept of stereotype threat
[01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:14.720]   is that we think we're moving to the next gen, which is,
[01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:18.800]   you guys right here are two of the most fabulous men
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:20.400]   that I have been around.
[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:21.600]   It's just set up for something.
[01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:27.280]   No, I'm so rarely this earnest, but you guys are amazing.
[01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:30.560]   You have-- especially you, Leo, you mentored me so much
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:31.400]   early in the day.
[01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:33.040]   I mean, I've known you for 15 years,
[01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:35.040]   and you started me on this career,
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:38.280]   and I never felt a gender bias from you.
[01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:39.880]   I am sexist, big, however.
[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:41.320]   That doesn't mean you didn't want to be,
[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:43.160]   so I'm just saying.
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:44.320]   I never did not.
[01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:45.920]   It didn't hurt that you were hot.
[01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:49.160]   I did never felt like you questioned my ability.
[01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:49.680]   No.
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:51.280]   And I think that that's the 2.0.
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:52.480]   And this company, I have to point out,
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:54.320]   is run by a woman, not by me.
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:56.040]   And John, I'm the same for you.
[01:15:56.040 --> 01:15:58.440]   But the point is, I felt it.
[01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:00.440]   And that's what stereotype threat means,
[01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:05.680]   is that women sometimes are so nervous about fitting
[01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:08.080]   the stereotype of not being geeky, not being
[01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:09.760]   sciencey, not being technical.
[01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:11.600]   Oh, women do crazy things.
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:14.080]   They overcompensate for that, and they
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:15.720]   will go crazy in the opposite direction
[01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:17.280]   and be as fugly as possible.
[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:19.680]   So you don't think they're too pretty to be smart.
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:22.160]   And I have talked to so many female engineers who
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:25.800]   have said things like, well, they didn't feel
[01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:28.840]   that they were discriminated against in that male environment.
[01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:30.840]   But they do put a lot of pressure on themselves.
[01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:34.400]   And I think that if there is a stereotype bias that
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:37.960]   comes from women, that the women of merit
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:40.880]   have to work very hard to overcome their own expectations
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:42.520]   of themselves, negative expectations of themselves.
[01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:44.640]   You know what I do like that is starting to happen?
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:46.600]   I've seen this happen at Google.
[01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:48.560]   Jolie's a good example.
[01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:50.880]   Maybe it's a post-feminist world, but there are a lot
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:55.560]   of women engineers at Google who intentionally look cute,
[01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:58.640]   and they dress well, and they don't play down their looks.
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:00.200]   They don't play down their feminists.
[01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:01.040]   And you're the same thing.
[01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:02.440]   I don't think that's post-feminist.
[01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:04.920]   I think that is very much part of feminism to say,
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:05.840]   because what?
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:07.520]   You expect this to be dumb, screw you.
[01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:09.600]   I'm extremely smart, and I will take your job right away.
[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:11.200]   And I'm not going to play the fugly game.
[01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:11.680]   Not you.
[01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:13.360]   No, and I'm not going to play the fugly game.
[01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:14.840]   I am going to be myself.
[01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:16.440]   And you better get used to it.
[01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:20.240]   And I'm my fifth stereotype, but I'm still going to be--
[01:17:20.240 --> 01:17:24.960]   I might put the stereotype of being girly or being femmy.
[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:27.880]   And I think that that's the next phase.
[01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:28.440]   I love that.
[01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:28.920]   I think that's great.
[01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:31.280]   Well, I think real feminism is saying you can look like whatever
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:32.320]   you want to look like.
[01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:34.680]   But we are going to take you at your intellectual--
[01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:36.720]   How many editors-- I'm going to give you a trick question.
[01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:39.240]   How many editors at Wikipedia do you think are women?
[01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:40.160]   What is the percentage?
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:41.160]   I'd guess 15%--
[01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:42.760]   15% or 10% or 10%--
[01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:43.760]   10.
[01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:44.920]   Oh, I was going to get sent.
[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:45.440]   I can read.
[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:46.440]   I can read.
[01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:47.440]   I think I read it all.
[01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:47.960]   It's 9%.
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:50.280]   It's a very surprisingly little number.
[01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:52.360]   And I don't know if that's because it's such a--
[01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:53.600]   it's not a male domino place.
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:55.080]   The women are spending all their time on Yelp.
[01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:57.200]   They've taken it over.
[01:17:57.200 --> 01:17:59.040]   And Pinterest.
[01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:00.120]   Is that right?
[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:01.120]   You.
[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:02.480]   You are so mean.
[01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:04.640]   You sucked me into that.
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:06.000]   That was a trap.
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.200]   I missed it completely.
[01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:08.400]   He trapped me into saying that.
[01:18:08.400 --> 01:18:09.240]   He's looking at it.
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:10.240]   You have a twinkle.
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:11.240]   Do you have money on this?
[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:12.800]   How many times he says Pinterest?
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:15.040]   No, it's just he knew that I would say something sexist.
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:16.040]   Yeah, of course.
[01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:17.200]   No, I don't think that's wrong.
[01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:18.200]   So--
[01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:19.200]   Yeah.
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:20.200]   You know what I'm going to do?
[01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:21.200]   I'm going to do it.
[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:22.200]   I'm going to do it.
[01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:23.200]   Wait, wait a minute.
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:25.920]   I want to defend the people that work at Google.
[01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:29.520]   You have to admit that the guys who went over there, they're the ones who let themselves
[01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:30.520]   go.
[01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:31.520]   Oh, God.
[01:18:31.520 --> 01:18:32.520]   All the free food.
[01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:33.520]   They're all fat.
[01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:34.520]   Every guy who's wanted to Google has--
[01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:35.520]   Oh, that's not huge.
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:36.520]   --is neck beard headquarters.
[01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:37.520]   I have a 20 pounds minimum.
[01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:38.520]   Sorry honey.
[01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:41.680]   That's some cute looking little engineers over at Google when I was there last week.
[01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:42.680]   They just started.
[01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:43.680]   You know what it is?
[01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:46.440]   You know, they have those bicycles, those dorky looking little Google bikes on campus.
[01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:47.640]   And I think that helps.
[01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:50.080]   I'm telling you, it's because they all commute down from San Francisco.
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:53.200]   You cannot-- it's very hard to commute and be fit.
[01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:56.080]   So we had on Twitch photo a Google engineer.
[01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:57.240]   I can't remember what she works on.
[01:18:57.240 --> 01:18:58.240]   I think it's Gmail.
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:18:59.240]   The ballgame.
[01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:00.880]   Her name is Petra Cross.
[01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:01.880]   She's beautiful.
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:02.880]   Great name.
[01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:05.280]   She dresses fantastically.
[01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:09.440]   She is the exact antithesis of what you would think of as an engineer.
[01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:10.440]   And when I met her--
[01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:14.400]   --petro cross, I'm just kind of goggle-eyed because you know me.
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:15.400]   I can't resist goggle-ized.
[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:16.400]   Goggle-ized.
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:18.400]   It was not-- it was--
[01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:21.400]   And then she says, oh yeah, my day job is I do Gmail.
[01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:24.880]   What do you mean, I write the code that runs Gmail?
[01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:25.880]   What is it like?
[01:19:25.880 --> 01:19:26.880]   Oh.
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:28.160]   And I just think this is great.
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:32.880]   And then there's people like Colleen Kelly, who was our chief engineer here for many years,
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:38.680]   who wears army boots and will beat the crap out of you.
[01:19:38.680 --> 01:19:39.680]   And I just think it's good.
[01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:45.080]   I think in a really truly meritocratic environment where people really care about what you think,
[01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:50.440]   not what you look like, you can be anything if you step up to the plate and you do it.
[01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:54.520]   That's why I love San Francisco, not LA, not New York.
[01:19:54.520 --> 01:19:59.480]   Because I feel like you are-- I mean, I know that it's weird and there's all this money
[01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:03.520]   stuff, but I do feel like fundamentally you are what you create and you are what you think
[01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:04.520]   and you are what you build.
[01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:05.520]   And we need to keep it that way.
[01:20:05.520 --> 01:20:06.520]   We need to keep it that way.
[01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:09.880]   And that's the one thing I like about Geeks is-- and this is why I hope that this sexism
[01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:12.880]   isn't real, is that they do value what you do.
[01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:13.880]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:14.880]   They pay attention.
[01:20:14.880 --> 01:20:15.880]   It's a meritocracy.
[01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:16.880]   They sure do.
[01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:17.880]   I always used to say--
[01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:18.880]   I don't know.
[01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:21.680]   I think there's a huge age-ish thing going on with these people.
[01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:22.680]   I agree.
[01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:23.680]   You know?
[01:20:23.680 --> 01:20:24.680]   Right.
[01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:25.680]   I think you're right.
[01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:26.680]   No, absolutely right.
[01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:27.680]   No, absolutely right.
[01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:28.680]   When you get a little snow in the roof, they don't--
[01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:32.120]   You know, if you weren't working this job that you've got here, Leo, you'd be done.
[01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:33.120]   You know what, actually, it's--
[01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:34.120]   I'm done anyway.
[01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:35.120]   This is a backwater.
[01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:36.120]   Are you kidding?
[01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:37.120]   I'm already done.
[01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:38.120]   Television's worse than Google.
[01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:39.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:40.120]   I disagree.
[01:20:40.120 --> 01:20:43.800]   I think television's getting much more comfortable with women of a certain age.
[01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:46.960]   That's-- and that's why Anne Curry is still working on the Today Show.
[01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:47.960]   No, no, no, that's wrong.
[01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:48.960]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:49.960]   It's not because she's 50.
[01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:50.960]   Absolutely not.
[01:20:50.960 --> 01:20:51.960]   Too shay.
[01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:52.960]   Nope, I disagree.
[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:53.960]   You might want to have it.
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:54.960]   You know better.
[01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:55.960]   Hey, I work at a network where--
[01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:56.960]   You're pushing 50.
[01:20:56.960 --> 01:20:57.960]   You've got it, babe.
[01:20:57.960 --> 01:20:58.960]   In like 20.
[01:20:58.960 --> 01:20:59.960]   Yeah, she's got it.
[01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:01.960]   We've got it, we've got it.
[01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:05.240]   No, I mean, I feel great about that at ABC.
[01:21:05.240 --> 01:21:09.840]   I may not last the distance, but we have, you know, a ton of women who are over 50 who
[01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:10.840]   are really--
[01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:11.840]   Did they look over 50?
[01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:12.840]   Yeah.
[01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:13.840]   Okay, there you go.
[01:21:13.840 --> 01:21:14.840]   That's great.
[01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:15.840]   And they look great.
[01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:20.760]   I look at Andrea Mitchell on an MSNBC who is a woman of stature, a journalist of stature,
[01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:22.520]   who is of a certain age.
[01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:23.520]   Yeah.
[01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:25.400]   And shows it doesn't look like she's had a lot of work done.
[01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:26.400]   She looks normal.
[01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:27.400]   Candy Crowley.
[01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:28.400]   Very good example.
[01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:31.640]   Heavy woman, but who is a great reporter, and it doesn't matter.
[01:21:31.640 --> 01:21:32.640]   Robin Roberts.
[01:21:32.640 --> 01:21:34.480]   I hope that that's the case.
[01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:35.480]   But then you look at local news.
[01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:36.480]   You're fooling yourselves.
[01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:37.480]   And it's Connie Tanakawa.
[01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:39.640]   Well, you've got to start somewhere.
[01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:41.320]   Yeah, I know you're right.
[01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:42.320]   I don't know.
[01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:43.320]   This is not a good conversation.
[01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:44.320]   Yeah, let's get on and out.
[01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:46.280]   Get only can lead to trouble.
[01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:47.280]   Yes, Andrew.
[01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:48.920]   You guys are more screwed than Jolie and I.
[01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:49.920]   Jolie and me.
[01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:50.920]   Sorry.
[01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:53.560]   I wish we were more screwed than you and Jolie, but that's not going to happen.
[01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:55.200]   What do you mean by screwed?
[01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:56.200]   See?
[01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:57.200]   I already did that joke, Josh.
[01:21:57.200 --> 01:21:59.200]   You were a stereo guy, but I don't know.
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:00.200]   But you know what?
[01:22:00.200 --> 01:22:01.200]   Did you know?
[01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:02.760]   Did you know I thought they were going there?
[01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:05.400]   They had just, they can't overcome their madness.
[01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:07.520]   They got that thought process going on in the background.
[01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:09.600]   That must take some CPU cycles out.
[01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:10.600]   You have no idea.
[01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:11.600]   You poor bastard.
[01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:12.600]   It's horrible.
[01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:13.600]   I feel so sorry for that.
[01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:16.280]   I always thought of it as testosterone poisoning.
[01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:17.280]   Ah.
[01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:18.840]   All right.
[01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:19.840]   Next topic.
[01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:20.840]   Item 5.
[01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:21.840]   E.P.
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:23.680]   Okay, we're going to do 130 on this.
[01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:24.680]   Go.
[01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:30.400]   Oh, which makes, in fact, was one of the creators along with others in the consumer electronics
[01:22:30.400 --> 01:22:37.060]   industry and the EPA created a certification called the E.P. certification for recyclable
[01:22:37.060 --> 01:22:40.120]   and green stuff.
[01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:42.200]   Apple has in the past submitted most of its products.
[01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:43.200]   Not all.
[01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:45.440]   iPad and iPhone were not submitted for E.P. certification.
[01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:50.400]   Last week, Apple said, "We are going to pull 39, all remaining 39 products of our product
[01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:54.500]   line from E.P.t. we are not going to participate."
[01:22:54.500 --> 01:22:58.000]   Well, maybe they didn't look, I don't know, but perhaps if they had looked, they would
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:01.800]   have noticed that the federal government requires that 95% of all products it buys are
[01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:02.800]   E.P.t.
[01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:03.800]   certified.
[01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:04.800]   So does Ford.
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:07.000]   So does a lot of companies.
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.500]   And so does, in fact, the city of San Francisco, which said we-
[01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:12.480]   Because Apple's such a big deal in enterprise and government.
[01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:16.040]   Well, maybe they thought we can get away with it.
[01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:19.040]   So the city of San Francisco steps forward and says, "Well, that means we're buying
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:20.240]   no more Apple products."
[01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:21.240]   Cinegal.
[01:23:21.240 --> 01:23:22.240]   No, no, I agree.
[01:23:22.240 --> 01:23:26.140]   And what she was saying was Apple can afford not to care because it's not a big market.
[01:23:26.140 --> 01:23:27.140]   Yeah.
[01:23:27.140 --> 01:23:28.140]   Well, maybe they do care.
[01:23:28.140 --> 01:23:29.140]   But people-
[01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:30.140]   There was a lot of press about this.
[01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:31.140]   They've made so much-
[01:23:31.140 --> 01:23:33.140]   They're gluing these things together now.
[01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:34.140]   Well, this is what-
[01:23:34.140 --> 01:23:35.340]   Okay, John, and I agree with you.
[01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:36.340]   This is what I thought.
[01:23:36.340 --> 01:23:39.740]   That it was the MacBook Retina display, which has the battery glued in, the screen glued
[01:23:39.740 --> 01:23:43.540]   in, is- I thought the like the iPhone and iPad, it's unrecyclable.
[01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:44.540]   It couldn't get E.P.
[01:23:44.540 --> 01:23:45.540]   It's sort of-
[01:23:45.540 --> 01:23:46.540]   Oh, when you all said-
[01:23:46.540 --> 01:23:49.620]   The E.P.T.E.L. said, "If you can't break it down, if you can't take it apart, you
[01:23:49.620 --> 01:23:52.220]   can't recycle it, and it's not going to get the seal of approval."
[01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:54.780]   So maybe that's where I got the idea, guess what?
[01:23:54.780 --> 01:23:58.800]   It is EPEAT certifiable and Apple has changed its man.
[01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:02.160]   A letter from a Bob Manseil senior vice president
[01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:02.160]   at his base.
[01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:03.140]   At his base.
[01:24:03.140 --> 01:24:03.960]   He was a part where at a space.
[01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:04.800]   He posted Friday morning.
[01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:06.860]   We've recently heard from many local Apple customers
[01:24:06.860 --> 01:24:08.360]   who were disappointed to learn that we'd
[01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:10.580]   removed our products from the EPEAT rating system.
[01:24:10.580 --> 01:24:14.560]   I recognize that this was a mistake.
[01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:17.400]   Starting today, all eligible Apple products
[01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:19.180]   are back on EPEAT.
[01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:21.660]   That's not the iPhone and iPad but everything else.
[01:24:21.660 --> 01:24:23.900]   Including the Retinitis.
[01:24:23.900 --> 01:24:26.620]   But I have to think I'm with John.
[01:24:26.620 --> 01:24:29.220]   I don't think this is recyclable.
[01:24:29.220 --> 01:24:31.740]   And I've talked to people that Kyle Weems and I fix it who
[01:24:31.740 --> 01:24:34.220]   says, when you glue this stuff together,
[01:24:34.220 --> 01:24:36.140]   it might be technically recyclable.
[01:24:36.140 --> 01:24:38.980]   It might be that, yeah, if you had the right heat gun,
[01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:41.660]   you could get the glass off the lithium ion
[01:24:41.660 --> 01:24:43.020]   and you could separate.
[01:24:43.020 --> 01:24:45.540]   He said, but no recycler has the time
[01:24:45.540 --> 01:24:47.460]   or the-- and it's not practically recyclable.
[01:24:47.460 --> 01:24:50.380]   Well, that's like when you read this Bob Manseil letter,
[01:24:50.380 --> 01:24:51.820]   it's extremely passive aggressive.
[01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:53.980]   He's like, well, Apple recycles all their own products.
[01:24:53.980 --> 01:24:56.700]   And we have a very aggressive 70% recycling goal.
[01:24:56.700 --> 01:24:58.580]   And we've been working on environmental things
[01:24:58.580 --> 01:25:00.260]   that EPEAT doesn't even care about yet.
[01:25:00.260 --> 01:25:01.700]   It's very passive aggressive.
[01:25:01.700 --> 01:25:03.980]   And they just really don't give a crap about the EPEAT.
[01:25:03.980 --> 01:25:04.900]   That's what I think.
[01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:07.500]   The impression they wanted to give is we're better than EPEAT.
[01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:08.740]   But they're not.
[01:25:08.740 --> 01:25:10.700]   These are not recyclable products.
[01:25:10.700 --> 01:25:11.740]   So what does this letter mean?
[01:25:11.740 --> 01:25:13.980]   I mean, I think there's two questions I have.
[01:25:13.980 --> 01:25:14.980]   I think John's right.
[01:25:14.980 --> 01:25:17.780]   I think somebody wrote a check to EPEAT.
[01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:18.900]   That's what I think.
[01:25:18.900 --> 01:25:20.140]   That's what I do.
[01:25:20.140 --> 01:25:21.780]   There's nothing in this letter that says,
[01:25:21.780 --> 01:25:23.140]   we've changed our practices.
[01:25:23.140 --> 01:25:23.620]   And now we will--
[01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:25.740]   We're not going to glue batteries into cases anymore.
[01:25:25.740 --> 01:25:26.660]   No, there's none of that.
[01:25:26.660 --> 01:25:27.780]   I think it's still not recyclable.
[01:25:27.780 --> 01:25:29.020]   This is all PR.
[01:25:29.020 --> 01:25:30.900]   But let's take a look at the future.
[01:25:30.900 --> 01:25:33.100]   What's going to be recyclable in the future?
[01:25:33.100 --> 01:25:33.380]   Nothing.
[01:25:33.380 --> 01:25:37.460]   Because we, as a consumers, want thin, light.
[01:25:37.460 --> 01:25:37.940]   Right.
[01:25:37.940 --> 01:25:40.780]   There has to be glued together.
[01:25:40.780 --> 01:25:41.140]   OK.
[01:25:41.140 --> 01:25:42.540]   This you want some big clunker?
[01:25:42.540 --> 01:25:44.940]   Until you get Google Glass, and it's all holographic anyways.
[01:25:44.940 --> 01:25:46.060]   I mean, I don't care anymore.
[01:25:46.060 --> 01:25:47.060]   That'll be the day.
[01:25:47.060 --> 01:25:48.180]   One other follow up on this.
[01:25:48.180 --> 01:25:50.820]   Is there anything substantial in this--
[01:25:50.820 --> 01:25:54.100]   just this phrase, I recognize that this was a mistake?
[01:25:54.100 --> 01:25:55.420]   Doesn't it seem uncharacteristic?
[01:25:55.420 --> 01:25:57.340]   Well, you never heard Apple say it made a mistake.
[01:25:57.340 --> 01:25:59.380]   Even in a Nintendate, it did not admit it mistake.
[01:25:59.380 --> 01:26:00.420]   You're holding it wrong.
[01:26:00.420 --> 01:26:01.100]   Yeah.
[01:26:01.100 --> 01:26:02.420]   You're holding it wrong.
[01:26:02.420 --> 01:26:03.700]   You're missing it wrong.
[01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:05.540]   Well, in a post-jobs era, I think
[01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:06.380]   that they can say that.
[01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:08.140]   Now I don't think Steve Jobs never would have said
[01:26:08.140 --> 01:26:09.060]   they made a mistake.
[01:26:09.060 --> 01:26:10.420]   Never.
[01:26:10.420 --> 01:26:12.380]   And he would have never allowed any of his people to say that.
[01:26:12.380 --> 01:26:13.380]   Yeah, that's what I--
[01:26:13.380 --> 01:26:14.260]   I just--
[01:26:14.260 --> 01:26:14.700]   [GASPS]
[01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:15.340]   Gasp.
[01:26:15.340 --> 01:26:17.020]   What?
[01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:18.140]   Wrong.
[01:26:18.140 --> 01:26:19.580]   But that's all PR and positioning,
[01:26:19.580 --> 01:26:21.580]   and really doesn't have anything to do with what they're,
[01:26:21.580 --> 01:26:23.940]   in fact, going to do, which is continue to make devices
[01:26:23.940 --> 01:26:26.540]   the way that they are making devices, which is profitable,
[01:26:26.540 --> 01:26:28.300]   and which is quick, and which you really can't recycle.
[01:26:28.300 --> 01:26:30.700]   And really, if you're going to lay blame at anybody's door,
[01:26:30.700 --> 01:26:32.780]   it's at us who binds.
[01:26:32.780 --> 01:26:34.260]   Well, at you, sir.
[01:26:34.260 --> 01:26:35.180]   Well, look at yours.
[01:26:35.180 --> 01:26:36.380]   This is not recyclable.
[01:26:36.380 --> 01:26:37.500]   Is this include together?
[01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:38.380]   Oh, please.
[01:26:38.380 --> 01:26:38.900]   I'm sure it is.
[01:26:38.900 --> 01:26:40.380]   I'm sure it is.
[01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:42.620]   And I'm not going to recycle it when I'm done with it.
[01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:44.220]   Well, Apple does when you buy an Apple product.
[01:26:44.220 --> 01:26:45.780]   It charges you a recycling fee.
[01:26:45.780 --> 01:26:47.420]   And in theory, you could bring it back to the--
[01:26:47.420 --> 01:26:49.300]   It should bring it back to the Apple store for reason.
[01:26:49.300 --> 01:26:49.820]   We can charge you money.
[01:26:49.820 --> 01:26:50.300]   Yeah.
[01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:51.900]   Well, you buy it or when you return it.
[01:26:51.900 --> 01:26:52.860]   When you buy it.
[01:26:52.860 --> 01:26:53.860]   Oh, OK.
[01:26:53.860 --> 01:26:55.620]   It's like, you know, the bottle bill.
[01:26:55.620 --> 01:26:58.300]   You have to pay a nickel for every time you buy a soda.
[01:26:58.300 --> 01:26:59.580]   Well, except you don't get it back.
[01:26:59.580 --> 01:27:00.420]   No, you never get it back.
[01:27:00.420 --> 01:27:01.660]   It's a scam.
[01:27:01.660 --> 01:27:03.860]   Well, if you bring the soda bottle back, you get it back.
[01:27:03.860 --> 01:27:04.420]   Yeah, who does that?
[01:27:04.420 --> 01:27:07.180]   I think we just identified another racket.
[01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:09.740]   Apple's recycling program/feez.
[01:27:09.740 --> 01:27:11.100]   I just-- OK, you're right.
[01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:13.100]   Somebody said Walter Cronkite would never
[01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:15.260]   have accused Apple of corruption without evidence.
[01:27:15.260 --> 01:27:15.620]   You're right.
[01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:16.900]   I have no evidence.
[01:27:16.900 --> 01:27:21.060]   That just strikes me suspicious that they suddenly
[01:27:21.060 --> 01:27:21.940]   are back in each piece.
[01:27:21.940 --> 01:27:23.980]   Who's the fender here?
[01:27:23.980 --> 01:27:26.900]   We got Apple people listening to the show.
[01:27:26.900 --> 01:27:28.780]   Of course we do.
[01:27:28.780 --> 01:27:31.780]   I just wonder, is it recyclable or is it just Apple got the--
[01:27:31.780 --> 01:27:32.860]   OK, let's put it this way.
[01:27:32.860 --> 01:27:34.300]   It seems scamish.
[01:27:34.300 --> 01:27:36.860]   I just-- I don't understand what changed.
[01:27:36.860 --> 01:27:38.300]   Why is it now recyclable?
[01:27:38.300 --> 01:27:38.800]   Yeah.
[01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:41.060]   It's not recyclable when I don't think he said that in the letter.
[01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:42.860]   I don't think he said, oh, we're changing the way
[01:27:42.860 --> 01:27:43.820]   we're making our products.
[01:27:43.820 --> 01:27:46.060]   He said all Apple products are now--
[01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:47.460]   That are eligible.
[01:27:47.460 --> 01:27:48.740]   All eligible good.
[01:27:48.740 --> 01:27:51.380]   Apple products are back on EP.
[01:27:51.380 --> 01:27:52.740]   So it doesn't mean a thing.
[01:27:52.740 --> 01:27:53.980]   Maybe it won't get on--
[01:27:53.980 --> 01:27:55.940]   Well, maybe the other shoe hasn't dropped.
[01:27:55.940 --> 01:27:58.140]   We haven't heard whether these will be certified or not.
[01:27:58.140 --> 01:28:00.180]   By the way, I think you got me banned from Apple events.
[01:28:00.180 --> 01:28:01.700]   I don't think they're going to change anything if it's--
[01:28:01.700 --> 01:28:03.500]   Yeah, I think what you said there, Leo,
[01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:06.060]   means you'll never get invited.
[01:28:06.060 --> 01:28:06.740]   Wait a minute.
[01:28:06.740 --> 01:28:08.140]   You're not getting invited anymore?
[01:28:08.140 --> 01:28:09.300]   You're good morning America.
[01:28:09.300 --> 01:28:12.100]   Well, we don't cover Apple events as much anymore.
[01:28:12.100 --> 01:28:15.180]   And I've applied for a couple of events for Yahoo stuff.
[01:28:15.180 --> 01:28:17.540]   And I think it goes back to that accidental ambush
[01:28:17.540 --> 01:28:20.380]   of Steve Jobs when I was streaming for you.
[01:28:20.380 --> 01:28:20.900]   Oh.
[01:28:20.900 --> 01:28:21.900]   Well, that was a good move.
[01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:22.980]   That was a good pressed move.
[01:28:22.980 --> 01:28:24.380]   So this was what?
[01:28:24.380 --> 01:28:24.980]   At the iPad?
[01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:25.540]   So you're banned.
[01:28:25.540 --> 01:28:26.940]   This was the MacBook Air.
[01:28:26.940 --> 01:28:27.580]   MacBook Air.
[01:28:27.580 --> 01:28:28.420]   These guys are banned.
[01:28:28.420 --> 01:28:30.420]   The Apple will not invite them to anything.
[01:28:30.420 --> 01:28:31.860]   So we don't know.
[01:28:31.860 --> 01:28:33.860]   By the way, I'm in the same group.
[01:28:33.860 --> 01:28:34.860]   I've been out longer.
[01:28:34.860 --> 01:28:36.100]   Julie, do you ever get invited?
[01:28:36.100 --> 01:28:36.460]   No.
[01:28:36.460 --> 01:28:37.740]   Oh, darling, I don't cover Apple.
[01:28:37.740 --> 01:28:39.580]   I don't like to jump through anybody's hoops.
[01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:42.220]   Yeah, so basically you're watching a panel for people.
[01:28:42.220 --> 01:28:44.220]   We don't know what we're talking about.
[01:28:44.220 --> 01:28:45.220]   No, no, what?
[01:28:45.220 --> 01:28:47.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:28:47.700 --> 01:28:49.220]   Let's talk, since you've got a cue.
[01:28:49.220 --> 01:28:50.620]   Let's talk about the cue, the Nexus 7.
[01:28:50.620 --> 01:28:53.020]   OK, we can talk about jelly bean butter.
[01:28:53.020 --> 01:28:53.940]   I had a cue.
[01:28:53.940 --> 01:28:55.020]   Not cool enough.
[01:28:55.020 --> 01:28:55.420]   Pardon me?
[01:28:55.420 --> 01:28:56.500]   Not cool enough.
[01:28:56.500 --> 01:28:57.460]   Oh, that was the silliest.
[01:28:57.460 --> 01:28:58.020]   And Samsung.
[01:28:58.020 --> 01:29:00.980]   Well, the judge worded that interestingly, which judge was that?
[01:29:00.980 --> 01:29:02.420]   You know, I know you're enjoying this show.
[01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:05.380]   But if you missed any of the shows all week long on Twitch,
[01:29:05.380 --> 01:29:06.660]   you missed a mouthful.
[01:29:06.660 --> 01:29:09.220]   Here's a little bit of what you might have seen this week
[01:29:09.220 --> 01:29:10.340]   on Twitch.
[01:29:10.340 --> 01:29:12.020]   This is Twitch.
[01:29:12.020 --> 01:29:12.980]   There we go.
[01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:14.260]   Now, that's not something--
[01:29:14.260 --> 01:29:14.940]   You're normal.
[01:29:14.940 --> 01:29:15.420]   --scary.
[01:29:15.420 --> 01:29:16.420]   Yeah, that looks terrifying normally.
[01:29:16.420 --> 01:29:17.940]   Sounds like a scare.
[01:29:17.940 --> 01:29:19.740]   You don't want to see that, but it's OK.
[01:29:19.740 --> 01:29:20.820]   Everything's going great now.
[01:29:20.820 --> 01:29:22.700]   Yeah, as I'm scared.
[01:29:22.700 --> 01:29:23.940]   So it's kind of silly.
[01:29:23.940 --> 01:29:25.380]   I mean, it's nice to come back.
[01:29:25.380 --> 01:29:28.620]   But is there any-- I mean, oh.
[01:29:28.620 --> 01:29:31.060]   So we just lost the USB dongle.
[01:29:31.060 --> 01:29:33.820]   Plus, I've got some great stories about jobs.
[01:29:33.820 --> 01:29:39.220]   Steve Jobs in Paris in the early '80s.
[01:29:39.220 --> 01:29:39.740]   OK.
[01:29:39.740 --> 01:29:40.500]   It was a good--
[01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:42.460]   They're not even really laughing about it anymore.
[01:29:42.460 --> 01:29:44.340]   They were like, oh, yeah, I read 50 Shades of Grey
[01:29:44.340 --> 01:29:45.980]   at the pool last weekend.
[01:29:45.980 --> 01:29:48.060]   And I'm like, are you telling me?
[01:29:48.060 --> 01:29:49.780]   It's like, aren't you supposed to be embarrassed?
[01:29:49.780 --> 01:29:52.260]   Lady Gaga, how do you think she's
[01:29:52.260 --> 01:29:53.580]   going to run her social network?
[01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:54.420]   Little Monsters.
[01:29:54.420 --> 01:29:55.820]   Are you a member, Gina?
[01:29:55.820 --> 01:29:56.860]   Little Monsters?
[01:29:56.860 --> 01:29:58.020]   Are you a little monster?
[01:29:58.020 --> 01:29:59.220]   I'm a little monster.
[01:29:59.220 --> 01:30:00.380]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:30:00.380 --> 01:30:01.580]   You really are?
[01:30:01.580 --> 01:30:02.340]   I really am.
[01:30:02.340 --> 01:30:03.500]   I really am.
[01:30:03.500 --> 01:30:04.980]   How did I know?
[01:30:04.980 --> 01:30:05.900]   Twitch.
[01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:09.980]   If it happens in the world of technology, we got your back.
[01:30:09.980 --> 01:30:10.700]   Clazap.
[01:30:10.700 --> 01:30:11.860]   Hold on a second.
[01:30:11.860 --> 01:30:12.260]   What?
[01:30:12.260 --> 01:30:13.860]   This was a house ad.
[01:30:13.860 --> 01:30:14.360]   Yeah.
[01:30:14.360 --> 01:30:14.940]   What's wrong with that?
[01:30:14.940 --> 01:30:16.860]   Why did you start doing house ads?
[01:30:16.860 --> 01:30:18.540]   You got cross promo.
[01:30:18.540 --> 01:30:19.980]   You know what we found out, John--
[01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:21.420]   We found out this show--
[01:30:21.420 --> 01:30:23.220]   this is our biggest show, by far.
[01:30:23.220 --> 01:30:25.980]   Most of the people who watch any show watch Twitch.
[01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:28.740]   What we have is 30 other great shows
[01:30:28.740 --> 01:30:30.140]   that people don't know about.
[01:30:30.140 --> 01:30:31.700]   So you become like a network.
[01:30:31.700 --> 01:30:32.340]   Oh, hidden network.
[01:30:32.340 --> 01:30:33.340]   You get no legal snails in there?
[01:30:33.340 --> 01:30:34.260]   You get like CBS.
[01:30:34.260 --> 01:30:37.260]   CBS comes along with their plug in their own shows.
[01:30:37.260 --> 01:30:38.780]   The next thing you know, the news
[01:30:38.780 --> 01:30:41.140]   is going to be about the show.
[01:30:41.140 --> 01:30:43.580]   You had Tom Merrow come up saying, by the way,
[01:30:43.580 --> 01:30:46.420]   and after Apple released their quarterly reports--
[01:30:46.420 --> 01:30:48.860]   Speaking of which, wonder what's going on in the week ahead,
[01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:50.060]   Tom Merren?
[01:30:50.060 --> 01:30:51.020]   Hey, thanks, Leo.
[01:30:51.020 --> 01:30:53.100]   Here's a look at what we'll be talking about on tech news
[01:30:53.100 --> 01:30:54.860]   today in the week ahead.
[01:30:54.860 --> 01:30:57.180]   There's a Fortune Brainstorm Tech Conference
[01:30:57.180 --> 01:30:58.740]   going on in Aspen.
[01:30:58.740 --> 01:31:00.900]   That's July 16 through the 18th.
[01:31:00.900 --> 01:31:01.980]   Lots of earnings.
[01:31:01.980 --> 01:31:03.060]   We're going to get them from Yahoo.
[01:31:03.060 --> 01:31:05.740]   We're going to get them from Intel on July 17.
[01:31:05.740 --> 01:31:08.820]   On July 19, it's earnings, Palooza, Google, Microsoft,
[01:31:08.820 --> 01:31:10.340]   Nokia, and Verizon.
[01:31:10.340 --> 01:31:12.460]   July 18, the day before that is IBM.
[01:31:12.460 --> 01:31:16.540]   July 17 and 18th is startup's demo day in Mountain View.
[01:31:16.540 --> 01:31:18.020]   And looking a little farther down the road,
[01:31:18.020 --> 01:31:21.020]   Black Hat's coming July 21 through 24.
[01:31:21.020 --> 01:31:23.700]   So look at what we'll be talking about in the week ahead.
[01:31:23.700 --> 01:31:24.140]   Back to you.
[01:31:24.140 --> 01:31:26.140]   I think Tom at Comic Con is that where he is?
[01:31:26.140 --> 01:31:27.980]   Yeah, San Diego.
[01:31:27.980 --> 01:31:30.660]   By the way, right after Black Hat, Def Con, that is a lot of fun.
[01:31:30.660 --> 01:31:32.060]   And I'm hoping we--
[01:31:32.060 --> 01:31:35.180]   there's a pen testing competition there.
[01:31:35.180 --> 01:31:36.780]   And one of our fans is going to be there.
[01:31:36.780 --> 01:31:37.980]   He's going to be on one of the teams.
[01:31:37.980 --> 01:31:40.660]   And I'm hoping we'll get some coverage of the--
[01:31:40.660 --> 01:31:41.340]   what do they call it?
[01:31:41.340 --> 01:31:42.660]   It's not Pwned Own.
[01:31:42.660 --> 01:31:46.020]   It's this kind of fun name.
[01:31:46.020 --> 01:31:47.340]   Anyway, that'll be fun.
[01:31:47.340 --> 01:31:49.420]   I have yet to beat this merit in this game.
[01:31:49.420 --> 01:31:54.020]   You just got suckered right into that team slide away.
[01:31:54.020 --> 01:31:55.940]   It's a capture the flag, exactly.
[01:31:55.940 --> 01:31:56.500]   That's what it is.
[01:31:56.500 --> 01:31:58.460]   It's like a capture the flag.
[01:31:58.460 --> 01:31:59.020]   A lot of fun.
[01:31:59.020 --> 01:32:00.660]   You set up servers as a team.
[01:32:00.660 --> 01:32:02.500]   And then you're trying to hack the other team servers.
[01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:05.220]   And the first team who hacks the other guys' servers wins.
[01:32:05.220 --> 01:32:06.580]   Oh, that does sound really fun.
[01:32:06.580 --> 01:32:08.660]   And then we're sending our security reporter
[01:32:08.660 --> 01:32:10.900]   is this little blonde 24-year-old dish.
[01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:12.060]   She's just so cute.
[01:32:12.060 --> 01:32:14.500]   And we're sending her to Def Con in Black Hat this year.
[01:32:14.500 --> 01:32:15.300]   That'll be fun.
[01:32:15.300 --> 01:32:16.060]   What's your name?
[01:32:16.060 --> 01:32:17.980]   Her name is Meghan Kelly.
[01:32:17.980 --> 01:32:19.540]   And we keep being like, OK, you've
[01:32:19.540 --> 01:32:21.420]   got to lock down everything with really good passwords.
[01:32:21.420 --> 01:32:23.020]   You do not leave anything open.
[01:32:23.020 --> 01:32:24.340]   And oh, it's going to be wonderful.
[01:32:24.340 --> 01:32:25.980]   I hope she gets hacked five ways to Sunday.
[01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:27.620]   Get your goat hair chaps, too.
[01:32:27.620 --> 01:32:29.140]   Remember when those were big at Def Con?
[01:32:29.140 --> 01:32:29.620]   Chaps?
[01:32:29.620 --> 01:32:30.860]   I missed that one.
[01:32:30.860 --> 01:32:31.460]   As in--
[01:32:31.460 --> 01:32:34.300]   Yeah, but made out of goat skin with long goat hair.
[01:32:34.300 --> 01:32:35.100]   Oh, that's my--
[01:32:35.100 --> 01:32:36.300]   Like, like, black skin memories.
[01:32:36.300 --> 01:32:37.620]   You're thinking-- no, you're a heckle.
[01:32:37.620 --> 01:32:38.580]   You're talking about--
[01:32:38.580 --> 01:32:40.980]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:32:40.980 --> 01:32:42.340]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:32:42.340 --> 01:32:43.900]   Oh, here, chaps.
[01:32:43.900 --> 01:32:44.980]   Side bar, just random.
[01:32:44.980 --> 01:32:47.140]   Since we're just going all over God's creation.
[01:32:47.140 --> 01:32:48.900]   Venture beat will be the place to watch
[01:32:48.900 --> 01:32:50.980]   your Def Con in Black Hat coverage.
[01:32:50.980 --> 01:32:51.460]   Yeah, sure.
[01:32:51.460 --> 01:32:52.820]   And you know, Patrick would go down there.
[01:32:52.820 --> 01:32:54.900]   He would not even bring a computer or any computing device.
[01:32:54.900 --> 01:32:56.820]   He said, I do not want to show up in the wall of shame.
[01:32:56.820 --> 01:32:59.140]   Well, we have to make her do reporting while she's down there.
[01:32:59.140 --> 01:33:00.340]   You know they have this wall of shame.
[01:33:00.340 --> 01:33:01.460]   If you get hacked, they put your--
[01:33:01.460 --> 01:33:02.700]   Oh, perhaps she's in the yellow--
[01:33:02.700 --> 01:33:04.140]   Well, maybe, maybe, who knows?
[01:33:04.140 --> 01:33:05.500]   She's actually really smart.
[01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:07.540]   I mean, she might fool everybody.
[01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:10.420]   We're going to come back and talk about story number five.
[01:33:10.420 --> 01:33:12.420]   Whatever it may be.
[01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:14.700]   Oh, yeah, Google thing.
[01:33:14.700 --> 01:33:18.060]   But first, a word from scoedspace.com.
[01:33:18.060 --> 01:33:20.580]   The secret is behind the best websites in the world,
[01:33:20.580 --> 01:33:22.820]   including our own inside Twit Blog.
[01:33:22.820 --> 01:33:25.260]   Squarespace sites are rock solid.
[01:33:25.260 --> 01:33:27.300]   It's hosting, plus the best software
[01:33:27.300 --> 01:33:32.020]   that combine to make a secure, fast, beautiful site.
[01:33:32.020 --> 01:33:34.980]   If you're looking to create a new website, maybe your first,
[01:33:34.980 --> 01:33:38.340]   maybe you're an old hand, Squarespace is the place to go.
[01:33:38.340 --> 01:33:38.780]   Check it out.
[01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:38.980]   Go to--
[01:33:38.980 --> 01:33:39.700]   I took your advice.
[01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:40.220]   I did it.
[01:33:40.220 --> 01:33:40.700]   Did you do it?
[01:33:40.700 --> 01:33:41.020]   What do you think?
[01:33:41.020 --> 01:33:41.940]   What's your site?
[01:33:41.940 --> 01:33:43.100]   Back at whirly.com.
[01:33:43.100 --> 01:33:44.620]   You moved it to Squarespace?
[01:33:44.620 --> 01:33:45.180]   I sure did.
[01:33:45.180 --> 01:33:46.900]   It took your advice because the thing that sold me
[01:33:46.900 --> 01:33:48.900]   was no two websites are like--
[01:33:48.900 --> 01:33:50.060]   This is gorgeous.
[01:33:50.060 --> 01:33:51.540]   Oh, I like the background.
[01:33:51.540 --> 01:33:51.860]   Yeah.
[01:33:51.860 --> 01:33:53.500]   This is not a cookie cutter.
[01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:57.940]   And it took, I don't know, half a day or something.
[01:33:57.940 --> 01:33:58.860]   It was fabulous.
[01:33:58.860 --> 01:33:59.780]   I love hosting.
[01:33:59.780 --> 01:34:00.780]   I love just everything.
[01:34:00.780 --> 01:34:02.140]   And it links to all of your stuff.
[01:34:02.140 --> 01:34:03.460]   So you can see Upgrade Your Life.
[01:34:03.460 --> 01:34:05.460]   You can see GMA.
[01:34:05.460 --> 01:34:07.300]   What's this next frontier thing you do?
[01:34:07.300 --> 01:34:08.820]   Oh, I'm doing another one of those.
[01:34:08.820 --> 01:34:13.380]   That's the documentary on green energy and green tech.
[01:34:13.380 --> 01:34:14.340]   Oh, those are good.
[01:34:14.340 --> 01:34:16.420]   Yeah, we're doing another one called--
[01:34:16.420 --> 01:34:17.220]   we've got the power.
[01:34:17.220 --> 01:34:19.540]   We're going to Spain to learn about molten salt storage
[01:34:19.540 --> 01:34:20.540]   for solar power.
[01:34:20.540 --> 01:34:22.660]   I'm super psyched about that.
[01:34:22.660 --> 01:34:23.780]   I can't believe how much it worked.
[01:34:23.780 --> 01:34:26.940]   The Travel Channel, the National Geographic Channel,
[01:34:26.940 --> 01:34:28.420]   Yahoo, ABC.
[01:34:28.420 --> 01:34:29.420]   You're amazing.
[01:34:29.420 --> 01:34:31.180]   But I use this week and--
[01:34:31.180 --> 01:34:31.700]   And tech.
[01:34:31.700 --> 01:34:32.020]   --twit.
[01:34:32.020 --> 01:34:33.380]   It's one of my favorite things ever.
[01:34:33.380 --> 01:34:34.380]   How was the experience building?
[01:34:34.380 --> 01:34:35.380]   I loved it.
[01:34:35.380 --> 01:34:36.420]   I found it really easy.
[01:34:36.420 --> 01:34:38.420]   I found the pricing to be reasonable.
[01:34:38.420 --> 01:34:39.700]   This is something that's amazing.
[01:34:39.700 --> 01:34:40.020]   So--
[01:34:40.020 --> 01:34:41.620]   Took advantage of your offer code.
[01:34:41.620 --> 01:34:42.460]   Did you thank you?
[01:34:42.460 --> 01:34:43.380]   Which I didn't realize.
[01:34:43.380 --> 01:34:44.860]   It's Twit plus the month.
[01:34:44.860 --> 01:34:45.420]   Is that right?
[01:34:45.420 --> 01:34:47.980]   Yeah, Twit's 7 for the month of July, for instance.
[01:34:47.980 --> 01:34:50.780]   So if you go to squarespace.com, this is--
[01:34:50.780 --> 01:34:52.260]   let's not-- don't show that.
[01:34:52.260 --> 01:34:52.660]   Oh, good.
[01:34:52.660 --> 01:34:53.660]   [WOOF]
[01:34:53.660 --> 01:34:54.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:34:54.500 --> 01:34:56.700]   Yeah, show John's empty chair.
[01:34:56.700 --> 01:34:59.540]   That would be safer than showing suck.com, which
[01:34:59.540 --> 01:35:00.460]   is what I just typed.
[01:35:00.460 --> 01:35:00.820]   That's you.
[01:35:00.820 --> 01:35:01.820]   Hugh.
[01:35:01.820 --> 01:35:03.660]   Thank god it was an empty--
[01:35:03.660 --> 01:35:04.420]   Oh, phew.
[01:35:04.420 --> 01:35:05.380]   --squarespace.
[01:35:05.380 --> 01:35:07.540]   Suck.com.
[01:35:07.540 --> 01:35:09.100]   That's a typo.
[01:35:09.100 --> 01:35:12.180]   Squarespace.com is--
[01:35:12.180 --> 01:35:14.900]   the best thing about it is it's very easy to try.
[01:35:14.900 --> 01:35:16.340]   You just go there, click the try it free.
[01:35:16.340 --> 01:35:17.380]   But you don't need a credit card.
[01:35:17.380 --> 01:35:19.260]   You get two weeks of the entire--
[01:35:19.260 --> 01:35:22.260]   the run of the place, including suck.com.
[01:35:22.260 --> 01:35:24.660]   It's not the same as Squarespace.
[01:35:24.660 --> 01:35:26.500]   I don't know why they keep showing up.
[01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:27.180]   Hey.
[01:35:27.180 --> 01:35:28.500]   You get the great templates.
[01:35:28.500 --> 01:35:32.620]   You get the great 300 plus Google fonts.
[01:35:32.620 --> 01:35:35.060]   Really easy importing from your existing site.
[01:35:35.060 --> 01:35:37.140]   If you have mobile type wordpress type header blogger,
[01:35:37.140 --> 01:35:38.860]   it just gets the whole thing, including all your links,
[01:35:38.860 --> 01:35:39.820]   all your SEO.
[01:35:39.820 --> 01:35:43.460]   They've got an iPhone and Android app that is just killer.
[01:35:43.460 --> 01:35:44.780]   Fabulous metrics, too.
[01:35:44.780 --> 01:35:46.540]   You sign into your dashboard with a widget.
[01:35:46.540 --> 01:35:47.060]   Do you like that?
[01:35:47.060 --> 01:35:48.620]   Just one click sign in.
[01:35:48.620 --> 01:35:50.540]   And then the metrics are really good.
[01:35:50.540 --> 01:35:53.340]   You can see who's your most recent comments.
[01:35:53.340 --> 01:35:54.900]   You can see where your reserves are.
[01:35:54.900 --> 01:35:56.220]   It's nice to know all of this.
[01:35:56.220 --> 01:35:56.720]   Yeah.
[01:35:56.720 --> 01:35:57.220]   Right?
[01:35:57.220 --> 01:35:57.900]   Yeah.
[01:35:57.900 --> 01:36:00.180]   Even if you're not trying to monetize,
[01:36:00.180 --> 01:36:01.980]   it's really just nice to know.
[01:36:01.980 --> 01:36:03.420]   By the way, and you mentioned the pricing,
[01:36:03.420 --> 01:36:04.380]   this is their new pricing.
[01:36:04.380 --> 01:36:05.500]   It's very simple.
[01:36:05.500 --> 01:36:07.460]   Basically $8 or $16 a month.
[01:36:07.460 --> 01:36:10.420]   Well, it's a yearly plan that you can go month to month
[01:36:10.420 --> 01:36:12.500]   if you want us a little bit more expensive if you do that.
[01:36:12.500 --> 01:36:14.300]   But $8 gives you the basic.
[01:36:14.300 --> 01:36:17.380]   But I think the best deal is $16 for unlimited pages,
[01:36:17.380 --> 01:36:20.460]   unlimited bandwidth, unlimited storage.
[01:36:20.460 --> 01:36:22.820]   For any annual plan, they will hook you up
[01:36:22.820 --> 01:36:24.940]   with your own custom domain, BeckyWorley.com,
[01:36:24.940 --> 01:36:25.860]   and do all the hookups.
[01:36:25.860 --> 01:36:26.860]   That was surprisingly easy.
[01:36:26.860 --> 01:36:27.540]   That saves you money.
[01:36:27.540 --> 01:36:27.740]   Yeah.
[01:36:27.740 --> 01:36:29.340]   That was what I thought was going to be a foster.
[01:36:29.340 --> 01:36:29.900]   It was good.
[01:36:29.900 --> 01:36:30.460]   Yeah.
[01:36:30.460 --> 01:36:31.020]   That was good.
[01:36:31.020 --> 01:36:32.020]   Well, you had an existing site.
[01:36:32.020 --> 01:36:33.540]   So you had a different situation where you were taking
[01:36:33.540 --> 01:36:34.540]   an existing site, right?
[01:36:34.540 --> 01:36:34.980]   No.
[01:36:34.980 --> 01:36:35.860]   Oh, this was brand new.
[01:36:35.860 --> 01:36:37.580]   I took that and just said bye-bye.
[01:36:37.580 --> 01:36:38.580]   Oh, good.
[01:36:38.580 --> 01:36:40.140]   Transferred and built.
[01:36:40.140 --> 01:36:41.220]   All through square space.
[01:36:41.220 --> 01:36:43.340]   So half a day.
[01:36:43.340 --> 01:36:44.460]   Half a day.
[01:36:44.460 --> 01:36:44.940]   There you go.
[01:36:44.940 --> 01:36:47.220]   That unsolicited testimonial.
[01:36:47.220 --> 01:36:48.780]   Now, here is the offer code.
[01:36:48.780 --> 01:36:49.700]   And this is only if you buy.
[01:36:49.700 --> 01:36:51.780]   You could try it free without an offer code.
[01:36:51.780 --> 01:36:54.940]   But if you do decide to buy 10% off your first purchase--
[01:36:54.940 --> 01:36:57.980]   so if it's the annual plan, it's a significant savings--
[01:36:57.980 --> 01:37:01.060]   use the offer code, TWIT7, TWIT7 when you buy.
[01:37:01.060 --> 01:37:03.540]   And the next month will be TWIT8, last month it was TWIT6.
[01:37:03.540 --> 01:37:04.860]   The reason I mention that sometimes people
[01:37:04.860 --> 01:37:07.140]   listen to the July show in August.
[01:37:07.140 --> 01:37:08.700]   So if you do that, use TWIT8.
[01:37:08.700 --> 01:37:11.460]   By the way, I built the whole site in trial.
[01:37:11.460 --> 01:37:12.580]   And then once I had it--
[01:37:12.580 --> 01:37:13.300]   And then you migrate it.
[01:37:13.300 --> 01:37:14.700]   I switched it to a paid--
[01:37:14.700 --> 01:37:15.420]   Very easy.
[01:37:15.420 --> 01:37:16.260]   Yeah.
[01:37:16.260 --> 01:37:16.660]   It's nice.
[01:37:16.660 --> 01:37:16.980]   I like it.
[01:37:16.980 --> 01:37:17.980]   It's a great picture of you too.
[01:37:17.980 --> 01:37:20.580]   BeckyWorley.com.
[01:37:20.580 --> 01:37:21.660]   That is so sweet.
[01:37:21.660 --> 01:37:23.540]   I've been following Becky.
[01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:24.180]   On the Twitter.
[01:37:24.180 --> 01:37:25.020]   Let's hope she doesn't turn around.
[01:37:25.020 --> 01:37:26.060]   Be Worley.
[01:37:26.060 --> 01:37:27.940]   Be Worley.
[01:37:27.940 --> 01:37:29.260]   I have to be Worley.
[01:37:29.260 --> 01:37:29.660]   What's your--
[01:37:29.660 --> 01:37:32.460]   No agenda show.com is on a Squarespace.
[01:37:32.460 --> 01:37:32.980]   Is it?
[01:37:32.980 --> 01:37:34.500]   Yeah.
[01:37:34.500 --> 01:37:35.420]   I don't know.
[01:37:35.420 --> 01:37:36.220]   No, it's true.
[01:37:36.220 --> 01:37:39.100]   If I go to Sean Hannity.com, we'll show up.
[01:37:39.100 --> 01:37:40.540]   I don't know if they still have it, but it should forward
[01:37:40.540 --> 01:37:41.220]   to the show.
[01:37:41.220 --> 01:37:42.180]   Let's see.
[01:37:42.180 --> 01:37:43.540]   Yep, goes right to No Agenda Show.
[01:37:43.540 --> 01:37:46.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:37:46.140 --> 01:37:47.220]   You didn't know that.
[01:37:47.220 --> 01:37:47.720]   No.
[01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:48.220]   Isn't that great?
[01:37:48.220 --> 01:37:51.220]   We got tons and tons of these things.
[01:37:51.220 --> 01:37:52.340]   You talk about community.
[01:37:52.340 --> 01:37:54.020]   You're the dirtiest dog I know.
[01:37:54.020 --> 01:37:55.380]   So you don't even do it.
[01:37:55.380 --> 01:37:56.620]   We just-- there was just our listeners.
[01:37:56.620 --> 01:37:57.940]   No agenda has the best--
[01:37:57.940 --> 01:37:59.660]   I don't know what the-- this story is,
[01:37:59.660 --> 01:38:02.540]   but that's an example of cultivating a community
[01:38:02.540 --> 01:38:03.900]   and a certain type of community.
[01:38:03.900 --> 01:38:05.460]   A community of trolls.
[01:38:05.460 --> 01:38:06.860]   That's beautiful, though.
[01:38:06.860 --> 01:38:08.300]   Not exactly trolls.
[01:38:08.300 --> 01:38:09.660]   OK, it's kind of trollish device.
[01:38:09.660 --> 01:38:10.180]   It's smart.
[01:38:10.180 --> 01:38:11.180]   Smart Alex.
[01:38:11.180 --> 01:38:12.180]   Smart Alex.
[01:38:12.180 --> 01:38:13.180]   We got some here.
[01:38:13.180 --> 01:38:14.020]   We got some here.
[01:38:14.020 --> 01:38:14.900]   We got a few here.
[01:38:14.900 --> 01:38:15.780]   I'm going to do that.
[01:38:15.780 --> 01:38:17.860]   We've been getting great studio audience lately.
[01:38:17.860 --> 01:38:19.060]   Thank you all for coming.
[01:38:19.060 --> 01:38:19.780]   I appreciate it.
[01:38:19.780 --> 01:38:22.540]   Is there anybody from outside the US here?
[01:38:22.540 --> 01:38:23.940]   Where are you from?
[01:38:23.940 --> 01:38:25.580]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:38:25.580 --> 01:38:26.100]   Whoa.
[01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:28.020]   Oh, the Dubai connection.
[01:38:28.020 --> 01:38:28.740]   That's awesome.
[01:38:28.740 --> 01:38:29.380]   Dubai 7s.
[01:38:29.380 --> 01:38:30.140]   That's awesome.
[01:38:30.140 --> 01:38:30.540]   I just--
[01:38:30.540 --> 01:38:34.460]   You live in one of those crazy developments?
[01:38:34.460 --> 01:38:36.500]   Like the poems, yeah.
[01:38:36.500 --> 01:38:37.580]   Dubai's amazing.
[01:38:37.580 --> 01:38:38.420]   Why are you living in Dubai?
[01:38:38.420 --> 01:38:40.300]   A lot of Brits go to Dubai for vacation,
[01:38:40.300 --> 01:38:41.380]   because it's nearby.
[01:38:41.380 --> 01:38:42.540]   And it's kind of close.
[01:38:42.540 --> 01:38:43.820]   But you're working there?
[01:38:43.820 --> 01:38:44.340]   Yeah.
[01:38:44.340 --> 01:38:44.860]   Wow.
[01:38:44.860 --> 01:38:45.380]   Interesting.
[01:38:45.380 --> 01:38:46.180]   Well, it's nice to meet you.
[01:38:46.180 --> 01:38:47.100]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:38:47.100 --> 01:38:47.900]   We appreciate it.
[01:38:47.900 --> 01:38:49.740]   If you want to join us for any show,
[01:38:49.740 --> 01:38:50.500]   you can always come by.
[01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:52.060]   We have an open studio.
[01:38:52.060 --> 01:38:54.380]   We just ask that you email my sister.
[01:38:54.380 --> 01:38:54.860]   Yeah.
[01:38:54.860 --> 01:38:55.860]   Yeah, that's all.
[01:38:55.860 --> 01:38:56.700]   She's the best.
[01:38:56.700 --> 01:38:58.940]   Eva at twit.tv.
[01:38:58.940 --> 01:39:02.060]   So did you play-- so you got a cue.
[01:39:02.060 --> 01:39:02.980]   We won't agree.
[01:39:02.980 --> 01:39:04.900]   The cue, what's the point, right, Jolie?
[01:39:04.900 --> 01:39:07.700]   I think the point is not immediately apparent.
[01:39:07.700 --> 01:39:08.060]   It's always--
[01:39:08.060 --> 01:39:09.460]   And I think that if I say something
[01:39:09.460 --> 01:39:13.300]   disparaging about the cue in six months when you can actually
[01:39:13.300 --> 01:39:14.980]   go and buy it and use it, then it'll
[01:39:14.980 --> 01:39:17.980]   be doing amazing things like shooting lasers,
[01:39:17.980 --> 01:39:20.340]   maybe entertaining your cat.
[01:39:20.340 --> 01:39:20.700]   All right.
[01:39:20.700 --> 01:39:22.060]   So here's the thing.
[01:39:22.060 --> 01:39:25.140]   At Google I/O, they loaded us down with three gadgets.
[01:39:25.140 --> 01:39:25.700]   It was like--
[01:39:25.700 --> 01:39:30.420]   Three, you got an Xs, a Q, an Xs, seven, and a Chrome box.
[01:39:30.420 --> 01:39:30.980]   I'm not going to--
[01:39:30.980 --> 01:39:30.980]   And--
[01:39:30.980 --> 01:39:32.380]   I took my bicycle to Moscone.
[01:39:32.380 --> 01:39:33.420]   I could barely make it home.
[01:39:33.420 --> 01:39:36.460]   I was like, heaving up the hill with 50 pounds.
[01:39:36.460 --> 01:39:36.820]   And this is--
[01:39:36.820 --> 01:39:37.540]   Look at that lady.
[01:39:37.540 --> 01:39:38.780]   She must be coming from Google.
[01:39:38.780 --> 01:39:39.500]   I go, oh, she's--
[01:39:39.500 --> 01:39:40.500]   Seriously.
[01:39:40.500 --> 01:39:41.300]   Yeah, that too is a heavy little--
[01:39:41.300 --> 01:39:44.300]   It's like a seven pound little-- what does it do?
[01:39:44.300 --> 01:39:45.060]   It's a cue ball.
[01:39:45.060 --> 01:39:45.700]   It's a cue ball.
[01:39:45.700 --> 01:39:47.700]   So you've not been able to get it to do much?
[01:39:47.700 --> 01:39:51.980]   Well, I mean, define much.
[01:39:51.980 --> 01:39:52.980]   Anything stream?
[01:39:52.980 --> 01:39:58.740]   Can I make it play a song on my television from my tablet?
[01:39:58.740 --> 01:40:00.860]   Or, well, it has to be running 4.1.
[01:40:00.860 --> 01:40:03.900]   And if you don't have the software update, then you're screwed.
[01:40:03.900 --> 01:40:04.400]   Oh.
[01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:04.900]   And you can't--
[01:40:04.900 --> 01:40:06.060]   Because you know, on the website they say gingerbread,
[01:40:06.060 --> 01:40:07.180]   but not so.
[01:40:07.180 --> 01:40:10.660]   I wasn't able to run the Nexus Q app on the--
[01:40:10.660 --> 01:40:12.580]   This is like layers within layers.
[01:40:12.580 --> 01:40:14.820]   It's like crazy software all the way down.
[01:40:14.820 --> 01:40:15.340]   And it's frustrating.
[01:40:15.340 --> 01:40:17.060]   Now, John has the Nexus Galaxy Nexus phone.
[01:40:17.060 --> 01:40:18.380]   And you like that.
[01:40:18.380 --> 01:40:19.660]   Oh, yeah, the phone's like--
[01:40:19.660 --> 01:40:22.140]   And that's running the buttery jelly bean.
[01:40:22.140 --> 01:40:27.020]   It's running butter on top of jelly bean, on top of toast
[01:40:27.020 --> 01:40:28.700]   with a little bit of marmalade.
[01:40:28.700 --> 01:40:31.980]   It's got marmalade running in the background with the butter
[01:40:31.980 --> 01:40:33.820]   and the toast and the--
[01:40:33.820 --> 01:40:34.940]   It feels like a T2.
[01:40:34.940 --> 01:40:36.540]   --it's in this phone.
[01:40:36.540 --> 01:40:39.620]   Now, if you just had marmite in there for a little protein
[01:40:39.620 --> 01:40:44.100]   and some WTF, then that would be a truly delicious sandwich.
[01:40:44.100 --> 01:40:45.860]   Marmite is WTF, I agree.
[01:40:45.860 --> 01:40:47.220]   Wow, OK.
[01:40:47.220 --> 01:40:49.660]   Now, on the other hand, people are raving about the Nexus 7.
[01:40:49.660 --> 01:40:51.700]   Mine just shipped, so I should get the next couple of days.
[01:40:51.700 --> 01:40:52.620]   Yeah, I've got one.
[01:40:52.620 --> 01:40:54.100]   What do you think?
[01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:55.140]   I don't have a big tablet.
[01:40:55.140 --> 01:40:56.860]   I mean, I've been playing Angry Birds on it.
[01:40:56.860 --> 01:40:57.940]   It's a tablet, dude.
[01:40:57.940 --> 01:40:58.860]   It's just a tablet.
[01:40:58.860 --> 01:40:59.380]   What's wrong with tablets?
[01:40:59.380 --> 01:41:00.540]   Nothing's wrong with tablets.
[01:41:00.540 --> 01:41:02.340]   The phone is a phone and the tablet is a tablet.
[01:41:02.340 --> 01:41:04.460]   And they're both really shiny and thin and nice.
[01:41:04.460 --> 01:41:05.780]   They're nice.
[01:41:05.780 --> 01:41:06.260]   Yeah.
[01:41:06.260 --> 01:41:08.180]   What do you want us to say?
[01:41:08.180 --> 01:41:10.340]   I'm in the same boat with her about--
[01:41:10.340 --> 01:41:11.700]   She's an ethnic technology person.
[01:41:11.700 --> 01:41:12.900]   I'm not an other technology.
[01:41:12.900 --> 01:41:13.780]   I think it's all great.
[01:41:13.780 --> 01:41:14.100]   But I'm missing--
[01:41:14.100 --> 01:41:15.140]   Did you know it has a--
[01:41:15.140 --> 01:41:17.060]   that they're all objectively--
[01:41:17.060 --> 01:41:19.740]   objectively, they're all kind of the same.
[01:41:19.740 --> 01:41:20.740]   Well, OK.
[01:41:20.740 --> 01:41:21.240]   OK.
[01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:21.740]   OK.
[01:41:21.740 --> 01:41:22.240]   OK.
[01:41:22.240 --> 01:41:23.740]   I will say something about that.
[01:41:23.740 --> 01:41:27.860]   Until this, Android tablets were not the same.
[01:41:27.860 --> 01:41:28.740]   They were junky.
[01:41:28.740 --> 01:41:29.340]   They were hard.
[01:41:29.340 --> 01:41:29.860]   They were.
[01:41:29.860 --> 01:41:30.340]   It was like--
[01:41:30.340 --> 01:41:30.860]   OK, so--
[01:41:30.860 --> 01:41:33.340]   So the fact that you even now can lump it even
[01:41:33.340 --> 01:41:34.940]   near the iPad is saying something.
[01:41:34.940 --> 01:41:36.100]   No, no, the 10 point one was pretty good.
[01:41:36.100 --> 01:41:36.900]   The 10 point one was already--
[01:41:36.900 --> 01:41:39.060]   It was running Honeycomb, which is a terribly ugly.
[01:41:39.060 --> 01:41:41.380]   It was the Tron of operating systems.
[01:41:41.380 --> 01:41:43.100]   Oh, it wasn't that bad.
[01:41:43.100 --> 01:41:44.260]   It wasn't very nice.
[01:41:44.260 --> 01:41:44.780]   Well--
[01:41:44.780 --> 01:41:47.260]   So the fact that they've got something that you say
[01:41:47.260 --> 01:41:50.660]   is in the ballpark with an iPad is saying something.
[01:41:50.660 --> 01:41:51.700]   Yeah, I suppose.
[01:41:51.700 --> 01:41:55.220]   But you know, I've done an iPad user either.
[01:41:55.220 --> 01:41:58.340]   I mean, I use a lot of iPads and I use a lot of gadgets.
[01:41:58.340 --> 01:41:59.340]   And I guess--
[01:41:59.340 --> 01:42:00.940]   It's not yet.
[01:42:00.940 --> 01:42:02.660]   You still don't have a cell phone, do you?
[01:42:02.660 --> 01:42:04.860]   No, I got it a feature phone, actually.
[01:42:04.860 --> 01:42:06.540]   It's got little buttons on it.
[01:42:06.540 --> 01:42:07.620]   It's so funny.
[01:42:07.620 --> 01:42:09.100]   So what happened in the Nexus?
[01:42:09.100 --> 01:42:10.500]   Did you give it to your husband to be?
[01:42:10.500 --> 01:42:13.420]   Yeah, the fellow is using all those things.
[01:42:13.420 --> 01:42:16.500]   The Nexus Q, though, no one uses that
[01:42:16.500 --> 01:42:18.380]   because we can't give a crap about it.
[01:42:18.380 --> 01:42:18.860]   We don't care.
[01:42:18.860 --> 01:42:20.780]   We've already got-- OK, we're gadget people.
[01:42:20.780 --> 01:42:22.660]   We have Sonos in the house.
[01:42:22.660 --> 01:42:24.260]   We have any number of media servers.
[01:42:24.260 --> 01:42:27.460]   We have so many devices that play--
[01:42:27.460 --> 01:42:30.580]   what's the thing that plays the music, the Spotify thing?
[01:42:30.580 --> 01:42:31.140]   Sonos.
[01:42:31.140 --> 01:42:34.980]   We have all this crap in the house already for--
[01:42:34.980 --> 01:42:35.780]   I love Sonos.
[01:42:35.780 --> 01:42:37.420]   This is their time to be a Sonos.
[01:42:37.420 --> 01:42:37.900]   It is.
[01:42:37.900 --> 01:42:39.140]   And I saw that and I thought that.
[01:42:39.140 --> 01:42:40.620]   They come in at a lower price than they--
[01:42:40.620 --> 01:42:42.220]   It's such a one-tick pony right now.
[01:42:42.220 --> 01:42:43.060]   $300.
[01:42:43.060 --> 01:42:43.660]   I know.
[01:42:43.660 --> 01:42:44.740]   And you know what, though?
[01:42:44.740 --> 01:42:49.140]   Eventually, it will be, I think, a Sonos combined with a Roku.
[01:42:49.140 --> 01:42:50.700]   And if they can get the price point down
[01:42:50.700 --> 01:42:53.220]   and make it do more cool stuff, if they could make it shoot
[01:42:53.220 --> 01:42:54.980]   lasers, everybody would get a good--
[01:42:54.980 --> 01:42:57.420]   Now, this is interesting because TK-421 in our chat room
[01:42:57.420 --> 01:43:00.820]   says there was a Doctor Who episode where people were given
[01:43:00.820 --> 01:43:02.900]   hand-sized spheres as gifts.
[01:43:02.900 --> 01:43:06.100]   And it turned out they were Trojan horses for sabotaging
[01:43:06.100 --> 01:43:07.340]   robot spiders.
[01:43:07.340 --> 01:43:08.340]   I think that's it.
[01:43:08.340 --> 01:43:11.620]   Have you tried it against a robot spider?
[01:43:11.620 --> 01:43:14.780]   Maybe it's sentient, and I'm the one who's like--
[01:43:14.780 --> 01:43:15.620]   What if it were?
[01:43:15.620 --> 01:43:16.700]   What if, like--
[01:43:16.700 --> 01:43:17.580]   Oh, here we go.
[01:43:17.580 --> 01:43:19.020]   Would not be great.
[01:43:19.020 --> 01:43:19.860]   Oh my god.
[01:43:19.860 --> 01:43:20.360]   OK.
[01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:21.340]   It's a Trojan horse.
[01:43:21.340 --> 01:43:24.540]   What if Google got this in a 6,000 developers' hands?
[01:43:24.540 --> 01:43:28.620]   And now, those 6,000 people are part of the new Google Army.
[01:43:28.620 --> 01:43:29.540]   Chad, take the camera off--
[01:43:29.540 --> 01:43:29.980]   Take the camera off.
[01:43:29.980 --> 01:43:30.500]   Take the camera off.
[01:43:30.500 --> 01:43:31.340]   He's jumped the shark.
[01:43:31.340 --> 01:43:32.660]   Completely.
[01:43:32.660 --> 01:43:34.780]   I am a Google Army.
[01:43:34.780 --> 01:43:36.340]   I have a--
[01:43:36.340 --> 01:43:38.300]   The Nexus Q-- you go to the website, they're talking about
[01:43:38.300 --> 01:43:40.100]   it's a social device and some sort of this.
[01:43:40.100 --> 01:43:41.860]   But you're supposed to hook it up at a party.
[01:43:41.860 --> 01:43:42.340]   Oh, that's a BS.
[01:43:42.340 --> 01:43:43.860]   And then everybody's supposed to think down--
[01:43:43.860 --> 01:43:44.380]   That's a BS.
[01:43:44.380 --> 01:43:45.380]   --and it's going to be run up.
[01:43:45.380 --> 01:43:46.900]   People have horrible taste in music.
[01:43:46.900 --> 01:43:47.980]   Cue cats.
[01:43:47.980 --> 01:43:48.820]   It's cue cat.
[01:43:48.820 --> 01:43:50.620]   And when you are controlling your party,
[01:43:50.620 --> 01:43:51.260]   you're running a party.
[01:43:51.260 --> 01:43:53.260]   You don't want everyone coming in, mixing up your music.
[01:43:53.260 --> 01:43:53.980]   That's not social.
[01:43:53.980 --> 01:43:54.500]   That's annoying.
[01:43:54.500 --> 01:43:55.420]   It's crazy.
[01:43:55.420 --> 01:43:56.180]   No, it is crazy.
[01:43:56.180 --> 01:43:58.060]   It reminds me of a Seinfeld episode.
[01:43:58.060 --> 01:43:58.500]   Yeah.
[01:43:58.500 --> 01:43:59.500]   Where somebody had to garden the music.
[01:43:59.500 --> 01:44:01.380]   Then you just won't invite your friends with bad taste
[01:44:01.380 --> 01:44:02.660]   in music, but they're your friends too.
[01:44:02.660 --> 01:44:04.300]   No, everyone has bad taste in music.
[01:44:04.300 --> 01:44:04.980]   I think you're right.
[01:44:04.980 --> 01:44:06.140]   Your initial--
[01:44:06.140 --> 01:44:09.380]   OK, quickly then we'll run through a couple other--
[01:44:09.380 --> 01:44:12.220]   why does Google keep signing me out of my Google drive?
[01:44:12.220 --> 01:44:14.140]   Because you keep talking crap about the products.
[01:44:14.140 --> 01:44:15.940]   Well, they're listening.
[01:44:15.940 --> 01:44:17.900]   We've been banned from Apple now.
[01:44:17.900 --> 01:44:19.140]   Push the button.
[01:44:19.140 --> 01:44:20.340]   There goes the free lunches.
[01:44:20.340 --> 01:44:22.340]   Dump 'em out.
[01:44:22.340 --> 01:44:24.020]   You have exceeded parameters.
[01:44:24.020 --> 01:44:26.540]   You are no longer a member of the Google army.
[01:44:26.540 --> 01:44:30.020]   Yeah, what story did you like bestly?
[01:44:30.020 --> 01:44:30.660]   Samsung.
[01:44:30.660 --> 01:44:34.220]   Samsung wins in court because the judge--
[01:44:34.220 --> 01:44:34.940]   this is a great Brit--
[01:44:34.940 --> 01:44:37.140]   and says, no, don't worry.
[01:44:37.140 --> 01:44:39.980]   Samsung's not cool enough to steal anything from Apple.
[01:44:39.980 --> 01:44:42.260]   You win.
[01:44:42.260 --> 01:44:43.140]   Did you see that, John?
[01:44:43.140 --> 01:44:44.620]   That is very funny.
[01:44:44.620 --> 01:44:46.340]   There's actually some truth to it.
[01:44:46.340 --> 01:44:47.140]   It was over one particular--
[01:44:47.140 --> 01:44:49.260]   The which devices this offers is the catnters
[01:44:49.260 --> 01:44:52.860]   that 10.1 design of the case.
[01:44:52.860 --> 01:44:54.100]   Let me look real quickly.
[01:44:54.100 --> 01:44:55.980]   This is from beta news, which by the way now,
[01:44:55.980 --> 01:44:57.700]   new owners of Dig.
[01:44:57.700 --> 01:45:00.220]   UK judge Colin Burst confirms with Apple fans
[01:45:00.220 --> 01:45:02.940]   of claim for years Samsung isn't cool enough
[01:45:02.940 --> 01:45:06.380]   to copy the trendy fruit logo company.
[01:45:06.380 --> 01:45:08.420]   The Samsung Galaxy tab family of tablets
[01:45:08.420 --> 01:45:11.100]   do not imitate the iPad because, quote,
[01:45:11.100 --> 01:45:14.020]   they're not cool enough and do not have the same understated
[01:45:14.020 --> 01:45:17.060]   and extreme simplicity possessed by the Apple design.
[01:45:17.060 --> 01:45:19.780]   That's the most subjective piece of crap I've ever heard.
[01:45:19.780 --> 01:45:20.340]   He's a judge.
[01:45:20.340 --> 01:45:21.260]   You can say anything once.
[01:45:21.260 --> 01:45:22.860]   Well, we'll leave for him.
[01:45:22.860 --> 01:45:24.740]   You ever shoot photos with this thing?
[01:45:24.740 --> 01:45:26.460]   It just wraps off as many as you can put you in.
[01:45:26.460 --> 01:45:27.620]   No, it's very fast.
[01:45:27.620 --> 01:45:28.820]   Yeah, it's fast as I've ever seen.
[01:45:28.820 --> 01:45:30.460]   It's a crappy camera, but it's fast.
[01:45:30.460 --> 01:45:31.420]   Yes, it's very crappy.
[01:45:31.420 --> 01:45:32.380]   It's a five megapixel.
[01:45:32.380 --> 01:45:33.780]   I don't understand why they went backwards.
[01:45:33.780 --> 01:45:36.260]   The Samsungs are all eight megapixels.
[01:45:36.260 --> 01:45:38.180]   It's not the number of pixels.
[01:45:38.180 --> 01:45:40.900]   No, in this case, it is, believe me.
[01:45:40.900 --> 01:45:42.300]   Samsung stores?
[01:45:42.300 --> 01:45:43.700]   Did you see the store that they opened that most?
[01:45:43.700 --> 01:45:45.180]   Yeah, I thought it was interesting.
[01:45:45.180 --> 01:45:46.220]   Why?
[01:45:46.220 --> 01:45:47.940]   Well, it looks so much like an Apple store.
[01:45:47.940 --> 01:45:49.300]   I'm telling you, this is the big trend.
[01:45:49.300 --> 01:45:50.460]   It goes to dust.
[01:45:50.460 --> 01:45:52.380]   All retail will look the same soon.
[01:45:52.380 --> 01:45:54.380]   It was a pretty big, not rip off.
[01:45:54.380 --> 01:45:56.900]   They have enough products that they can do this.
[01:45:56.900 --> 01:45:57.660]   Samsung does.
[01:45:57.660 --> 01:46:00.140]   Google's going to pay a $22.5 million fine.
[01:46:00.140 --> 01:46:02.020]   Remember the Google thing on the iPhone?
[01:46:02.020 --> 01:46:03.020]   Sorry.
[01:46:03.020 --> 01:46:05.740]   Where they hacked Safari so that they could have a like button
[01:46:05.740 --> 01:46:06.540]   for a certain plus button.
[01:46:06.540 --> 01:46:08.900]   Yeah, wasn't that funny?
[01:46:08.900 --> 01:46:10.940]   So the FTC's fined them.
[01:46:10.940 --> 01:46:12.780]   But $22.5 million for Google.
[01:46:12.780 --> 01:46:13.300]   It's like--
[01:46:13.300 --> 01:46:13.460]   Five hours?
[01:46:13.460 --> 01:46:14.700]   I still think it was a heavy fine.
[01:46:14.700 --> 01:46:15.220]   Five hours?
[01:46:15.220 --> 01:46:17.100]   Yeah, but it was a heavy fine anywhere.
[01:46:17.100 --> 01:46:18.500]   I think they shouldn't-- what were they fine?
[01:46:18.500 --> 01:46:20.940]   So what?
[01:46:20.940 --> 01:46:25.580]   They hadn't they just signed all of these privacy policy,
[01:46:25.580 --> 01:46:26.260]   and it was sort of like--
[01:46:26.260 --> 01:46:30.900]   I can tell you, I argued strongly that this was a so what.
[01:46:30.900 --> 01:46:32.900]   And I went to a buzzsaw.
[01:46:32.900 --> 01:46:35.900]   But I'm going to do it again, our fine audience.
[01:46:35.900 --> 01:46:36.620]   Well, they're honest.
[01:46:36.620 --> 01:46:37.820]   It says, Leo, you don't get it.
[01:46:37.820 --> 01:46:39.260]   You don't understand privacy.
[01:46:39.260 --> 01:46:42.580]   There's a bunch of maniacs in the chat room.
[01:46:42.580 --> 01:46:43.580]   Yeah.
[01:46:43.580 --> 01:46:45.740]   I'm not related to Nancy.
[01:46:45.740 --> 01:46:46.260]   John Cena.
[01:46:46.260 --> 01:46:46.620]   There are maniacs.
[01:46:46.620 --> 01:46:48.420]   Chat rooms are all maniacs.
[01:46:48.420 --> 01:46:49.260]   We love them.
[01:46:49.260 --> 01:46:49.780]   We love you.
[01:46:49.780 --> 01:46:53.300]   The FTC has charged Google of tricking the Safari browser
[01:46:53.300 --> 01:46:55.460]   into it accepting and advertising cookie.
[01:46:55.460 --> 01:46:56.980]   Now, my argument--
[01:46:56.980 --> 01:46:58.140]   I'm going to say it again.
[01:46:58.140 --> 01:47:00.100]   My argument was that Apple was acting
[01:47:00.100 --> 01:47:02.780]   anti-competitively because Apple had do not
[01:47:02.780 --> 01:47:05.820]   track turned on by default, blocked these cookies--
[01:47:05.820 --> 01:47:06.820]   actually, it's not do not track.
[01:47:06.820 --> 01:47:08.980]   It's third party cookies, blocked them by default,
[01:47:08.980 --> 01:47:13.780]   without asking the user or giving you a setting.
[01:47:13.780 --> 01:47:14.620]   And what Google was--
[01:47:14.620 --> 01:47:15.820]   Well, that's very pro-consumer.
[01:47:15.820 --> 01:47:16.540]   Well, that's Apple.
[01:47:16.540 --> 01:47:18.420]   And anti-Google at the same time.
[01:47:18.420 --> 01:47:19.180]   Well, that's the thing.
[01:47:19.180 --> 01:47:21.060]   I think, yeah, you can make an arguments pro-consumer
[01:47:21.060 --> 01:47:21.900]   in which Apple did.
[01:47:21.900 --> 01:47:23.460]   You can also make the argument that Apple wanted
[01:47:23.460 --> 01:47:26.540]   to keep all your information to itself for its own network.
[01:47:26.540 --> 01:47:28.540]   Oh, they'll screw Google any chance they get.
[01:47:28.540 --> 01:47:30.740]   So they'll all screw each other any chance they get
[01:47:30.740 --> 01:47:33.700]   because that's how they make money by screwing each other.
[01:47:33.700 --> 01:47:34.220]   And us.
[01:47:34.220 --> 01:47:36.180]   And sometimes getting us to pay for things that we--
[01:47:36.180 --> 01:47:39.460]   By the way, that's the largest fine ever imposed
[01:47:39.460 --> 01:47:41.260]   by the FTC on a single company.
[01:47:41.260 --> 01:47:43.140]   Well, that's inflation for you.
[01:47:43.140 --> 01:47:45.540]   And I want to remind the chat room that if they bring us
[01:47:45.540 --> 01:47:48.580]   up the gateway stores, I do discuss this in my columns
[01:47:48.580 --> 01:47:49.540]   about the retail.
[01:47:49.540 --> 01:47:50.940]   So I cover it.
[01:47:50.940 --> 01:47:52.220]   That's like Microsoft.
[01:47:52.220 --> 01:47:53.340]   I was thinking about earlier.
[01:47:53.340 --> 01:47:55.620]   It's like Microsoft announcing the tablet in 2002,
[01:47:55.620 --> 01:47:57.660]   gateway with the store in 2000.
[01:47:57.660 --> 01:47:59.860]   Yeah, but the gateway stores were terrible.
[01:47:59.860 --> 01:48:01.700]   I mean, they were fine when they were out in the middle of nowhere
[01:48:01.700 --> 01:48:03.980]   or people couldn't get computers that are called country stores.
[01:48:03.980 --> 01:48:06.860]   But when they actually-- when you saw one close up,
[01:48:06.860 --> 01:48:10.380]   it was too much like a Hudson dealership.
[01:48:10.380 --> 01:48:11.140]   It had no--
[01:48:11.140 --> 01:48:12.660]   They remember the Hudson.
[01:48:12.660 --> 01:48:13.860]   That was a great car.
[01:48:13.860 --> 01:48:15.660]   No idea what you're talking about.
[01:48:15.660 --> 01:48:17.900]   What are you talking about, a Hudson dealership?
[01:48:17.900 --> 01:48:19.300]   You don't even remember the Hudson.
[01:48:19.300 --> 01:48:21.860]   I actually do remember the Hudson.
[01:48:21.860 --> 01:48:22.500]   What?
[01:48:22.500 --> 01:48:23.820]   An old one in the garage?
[01:48:23.820 --> 01:48:24.220]   No, no.
[01:48:24.220 --> 01:48:27.020]   The Hudson during the early days of drag racing
[01:48:27.020 --> 01:48:30.060]   was one of the hottest cars you could race as a stock car
[01:48:30.060 --> 01:48:33.820]   because they stated there's horsepower wrong.
[01:48:33.820 --> 01:48:34.540]   So the things--
[01:48:34.540 --> 01:48:35.420]   Oh, that's funny.
[01:48:35.420 --> 01:48:37.060]   So it got through even though--
[01:48:37.060 --> 01:48:37.940]   That's the teacher.
[01:48:37.940 --> 01:48:40.340]   They were keeping those things going for a long time.
[01:48:40.340 --> 01:48:43.220]   You know, this is going to be our last story, Story 6.
[01:48:43.220 --> 01:48:46.260]   And I think is the response to, OK, so the FTC finds
[01:48:46.260 --> 01:48:49.660]   Google for this privacy invasion.
[01:48:49.660 --> 01:48:52.780]   This is minor compared to the fact
[01:48:52.780 --> 01:48:56.660]   that the cell phone companies are selling your personal information
[01:48:56.660 --> 01:48:57.700]   to law enforcement.
[01:48:57.700 --> 01:48:59.060]   Oh, they're not selling it.
[01:48:59.060 --> 01:49:00.100]   Oh, they are selling it.
[01:49:00.100 --> 01:49:01.660]   So they're not just as interesting.
[01:49:01.660 --> 01:49:02.820]   Wait a minute, Jolie Odell.
[01:49:02.820 --> 01:49:03.700]   I beg to differ.
[01:49:03.700 --> 01:49:06.900]   AT&T has 100 full-time employees.
[01:49:06.900 --> 01:49:10.660]   They charge several dollars for each of these pen warrants.
[01:49:10.660 --> 01:49:11.300]   Yes.
[01:49:11.300 --> 01:49:12.700]   They make a lot of money.
[01:49:12.700 --> 01:49:13.820]   This is big business.
[01:49:13.820 --> 01:49:14.180]   They make some money.
[01:49:14.180 --> 01:49:14.620]   This is not--
[01:49:14.620 --> 01:49:16.780]   This is a drop in the bucket if you're AT&T.
[01:49:16.780 --> 01:49:20.340]   1,500 data requests on an average day for Sprint.
[01:49:20.340 --> 01:49:21.220]   OK, we skip the lead.
[01:49:21.220 --> 01:49:22.100]   So--
[01:49:22.100 --> 01:49:22.620]   Please.
[01:49:22.620 --> 01:49:25.900]   --law enforcement agencies are requesting at record rates
[01:49:25.900 --> 01:49:27.980]   cell phone data from the carriers.
[01:49:27.980 --> 01:49:28.500]   1.3 million--
[01:49:28.500 --> 01:49:30.380]   Well, that's because there's more cell phone data
[01:49:30.380 --> 01:49:31.380]   than ever before.
[01:49:31.380 --> 01:49:33.660]   And this is information that they're not
[01:49:33.660 --> 01:49:35.740]   requesting from other sources.
[01:49:35.740 --> 01:49:37.460]   But understand the backstory of this.
[01:49:37.460 --> 01:49:39.180]   These are warrantless searches.
[01:49:39.180 --> 01:49:43.500]   So there are some things that, if it's content,
[01:49:43.500 --> 01:49:45.620]   federal law requires a warrant.
[01:49:45.620 --> 01:49:48.260]   But it's not your location, the information
[01:49:48.260 --> 01:49:50.100]   about who you're sending email to, things like that,
[01:49:50.100 --> 01:49:51.660]   are not deemed content.
[01:49:51.660 --> 01:49:52.780]   So the law enforcement--
[01:49:52.780 --> 01:49:53.980]   Isn't that state by state?
[01:49:53.980 --> 01:49:56.180]   Because I know, didn't a federal judge
[01:49:56.180 --> 01:49:58.060]   decide that cops, without a warrant,
[01:49:58.060 --> 01:50:00.700]   all they were allowed to take is your own phone number
[01:50:00.700 --> 01:50:01.660]   from your phone?
[01:50:01.660 --> 01:50:02.740]   That was a whole case.
[01:50:02.740 --> 01:50:04.740]   And it's still very much up for grabs.
[01:50:04.740 --> 01:50:07.100]   Like, what does it mean that a cop can search your phone?
[01:50:07.100 --> 01:50:08.140]   What kind of stuff can you get?
[01:50:08.140 --> 01:50:11.460]   It was when I was watching "Law and Order."
[01:50:11.460 --> 01:50:12.740]   I don't know if it's state by state.
[01:50:12.740 --> 01:50:15.100]   This is being investigated at the national level.
[01:50:15.100 --> 01:50:19.940]   Ed Markey has asked for reports from all the carriers
[01:50:19.940 --> 01:50:22.380]   responding to an article in the "New York Times" in April
[01:50:22.380 --> 01:50:26.100]   upon about this increased use of cell phone tracking
[01:50:26.100 --> 01:50:30.540]   and got letters from all of them with stunning information.
[01:50:30.540 --> 01:50:32.260]   I mean, this is a huge amount.
[01:50:32.260 --> 01:50:34.100]   AT&T responds to 700 requests a day
[01:50:34.100 --> 01:50:37.260]   with about 230 of them, quote, "emergencies that do not
[01:50:37.260 --> 01:50:39.020]   require court orders or subpoenas."
[01:50:39.020 --> 01:50:42.020]   OK, but let's just-- that's 1,400 bucks a day.
[01:50:42.020 --> 01:50:43.740]   But they're making if they charge a buck or two.
[01:50:43.740 --> 01:50:45.020]   Well, I don't know how much they charge.
[01:50:45.020 --> 01:50:45.540]   They--
[01:50:45.540 --> 01:50:46.420]   I bought it.
[01:50:46.420 --> 01:50:48.220]   It is not an insignificant amount of money.
[01:50:48.220 --> 01:50:49.380]   It's not a profit center.
[01:50:49.380 --> 01:50:50.580]   It was beside the point.
[01:50:50.580 --> 01:50:51.460]   They're not making money.
[01:50:51.460 --> 01:50:52.780]   They're not running a racket.
[01:50:52.780 --> 01:50:53.980]   Like that's-- yeah, bottom line.
[01:50:53.980 --> 01:50:54.500]   You're right.
[01:50:54.500 --> 01:50:56.380]   I disagree there as well, because like I said,
[01:50:56.380 --> 01:50:58.980]   I think that instead of coming and knocking on your door
[01:50:58.980 --> 01:51:00.300]   and asking your neighbors what you're doing,
[01:51:00.300 --> 01:51:02.620]   this is how they're gathering information about people who
[01:51:02.620 --> 01:51:03.420]   may not be doing anything.
[01:51:03.420 --> 01:51:04.780]   And then they knock on your door and shoot up the place
[01:51:04.780 --> 01:51:06.060]   and find out it's the wrong address.
[01:51:06.060 --> 01:51:07.020]   Who the heck knows?
[01:51:07.020 --> 01:51:09.380]   Well, they won't if you were using your cell phone.
[01:51:09.380 --> 01:51:11.860]   The real issue is, is it a fishing expedition
[01:51:11.860 --> 01:51:14.420]   or is this in pursuit of a specific crime
[01:51:14.420 --> 01:51:15.340]   in a specific event?
[01:51:15.340 --> 01:51:16.980]   I think it's efficient police work.
[01:51:16.980 --> 01:51:17.660]   Because if--
[01:51:17.660 --> 01:51:18.620]   Look at Oakland.
[01:51:18.620 --> 01:51:19.860]   Or a fishing--
[01:51:19.860 --> 01:51:21.060]   Well, a fishing police work.
[01:51:21.060 --> 01:51:22.100]   So here's an example.
[01:51:22.100 --> 01:51:24.860]   Oakland has three cops for property crimes.
[01:51:24.860 --> 01:51:29.340]   There are 1,500 property crimes reported every year.
[01:51:29.340 --> 01:51:32.860]   So how can they best use their resources to Jolie's point?
[01:51:32.860 --> 01:51:34.020]   Are they going to knock on the doors?
[01:51:34.020 --> 01:51:35.660]   Are they going to call the cell phone company
[01:51:35.660 --> 01:51:37.180]   and say, OK, give us all you can?
[01:51:37.180 --> 01:51:38.460]   Well, let me ask you this.
[01:51:38.460 --> 01:51:40.900]   So one of the kinds of requests companies can make
[01:51:40.900 --> 01:51:43.940]   is what's called a tower dump.
[01:51:43.940 --> 01:51:46.660]   All the data, including names of everybody
[01:51:46.660 --> 01:51:50.220]   who used that tower during a period of time.
[01:51:50.220 --> 01:51:52.300]   You get a lot of--
[01:51:52.300 --> 01:51:53.020]   What do they call it?
[01:51:53.020 --> 01:51:53.820]   How do you feel about that?
[01:51:53.820 --> 01:51:55.940]   Hundreds or thousands of names in that zone.
[01:51:55.940 --> 01:51:58.980]   These are the risks associated with using technology.
[01:51:58.980 --> 01:52:00.940]   If you don't like it, you really
[01:52:00.940 --> 01:52:03.180]   have to set up your own cell network.
[01:52:03.180 --> 01:52:04.860]   And you have to run your own servers.
[01:52:04.860 --> 01:52:06.540]   And you have to be much more careful.
[01:52:06.540 --> 01:52:09.620]   Because when you sign a contract with AT&T,
[01:52:09.620 --> 01:52:10.940]   this is what you're saying--
[01:52:10.940 --> 01:52:11.780]   This is what you're saying--
[01:52:11.780 --> 01:52:14.660]   No, or you tell law enforcement, knock it off.
[01:52:14.660 --> 01:52:15.820]   That's out of control.
[01:52:15.820 --> 01:52:18.180]   I agree with standards that everyone agrees on,
[01:52:18.180 --> 01:52:20.140]   and these are the rules, and this is what you know,
[01:52:20.140 --> 01:52:21.740]   and yes, we've watched enough law and order
[01:52:21.740 --> 01:52:23.500]   that we know that when we use our fast track
[01:52:23.500 --> 01:52:26.260]   and we go down the Bay Bridge, that the cops can find that.
[01:52:26.260 --> 01:52:28.060]   We're trackable.
[01:52:28.060 --> 01:52:28.660]   I think that--
[01:52:28.660 --> 01:52:30.140]   It all goes back to law and order for me.
[01:52:30.140 --> 01:52:31.060]   Yeah, apparently.
[01:52:31.060 --> 01:52:31.660]   I think it's--
[01:52:31.660 --> 01:52:32.940]   I think they took it off the air, right?
[01:52:32.940 --> 01:52:34.380]   It's very risky.
[01:52:34.380 --> 01:52:36.900]   It's very risky to wash your hands of this and say,
[01:52:36.900 --> 01:52:37.460]   you know what?
[01:52:37.460 --> 01:52:39.060]   You're carrying a cell phone.
[01:52:39.060 --> 01:52:41.660]   It's let the law enforcement have whatever they want.
[01:52:41.660 --> 01:52:43.180]   I think we need to stand up.
[01:52:43.180 --> 01:52:45.580]   As American citizens have said, that's unlawful search
[01:52:45.580 --> 01:52:46.100]   and seizure.
[01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:47.420]   It's unconstitutional.
[01:52:47.420 --> 01:52:48.780]   You've got to knock it off.
[01:52:48.780 --> 01:52:50.060]   So what would you say they need to work?
[01:52:50.060 --> 01:52:51.060]   It is, by the way.
[01:52:51.060 --> 01:52:51.740]   It is, by the way.
[01:52:51.740 --> 01:52:52.100]   It is, by the way.
[01:52:52.100 --> 01:52:53.380]   We don't have those standards yet.
[01:52:53.380 --> 01:52:55.260]   And part of this discussion that we're having
[01:52:55.260 --> 01:52:58.420]   and that the judges are deciding is creating those standards.
[01:52:58.420 --> 01:53:00.300]   So of course, police shouldn't be
[01:53:00.300 --> 01:53:01.740]   able to look through your phone whenever they want
[01:53:01.740 --> 01:53:03.180]   for any reason at all.
[01:53:03.180 --> 01:53:05.340]   But I think I give them a little bit more credit,
[01:53:05.340 --> 01:53:06.940]   a smidge more credit than you do.
[01:53:06.940 --> 01:53:09.900]   Just let's just get rid of the Patriot Act and we'll be fine.
[01:53:09.900 --> 01:53:10.460]   There you go.
[01:53:10.460 --> 01:53:12.500]   Oh, but I guess this recent administration,
[01:53:12.500 --> 01:53:13.100]   they put it back in.
[01:53:13.100 --> 01:53:14.740]   You'll be able to pull your eye on it.
[01:53:14.740 --> 01:53:16.340]   Oh, no, we can't talk politics.
[01:53:16.340 --> 01:53:17.340]   So you say it has to be--
[01:53:17.340 --> 01:53:17.820]   I just think that--
[01:53:17.820 --> 01:53:22.580]   I just think that there's no judicial oversight.
[01:53:22.580 --> 01:53:24.860]   Basically, you may say there's no money in it,
[01:53:24.860 --> 01:53:27.300]   but it's an unholy annexes between the phone companies, which
[01:53:27.300 --> 01:53:28.700]   do in fact make money on this.
[01:53:28.700 --> 01:53:31.020]   Maybe it's not a lot, but they still make money on it.
[01:53:31.020 --> 01:53:33.940]   And law enforcement, nobody's watching out over this.
[01:53:33.940 --> 01:53:36.340]   I hope that this-- I think everybody needs to understand
[01:53:36.340 --> 01:53:37.620]   that this is going on.
[01:53:37.620 --> 01:53:39.140]   And it doesn't mean throw away your cell phone.
[01:53:39.140 --> 01:53:42.180]   It means it calls for reforms.
[01:53:42.180 --> 01:53:46.140]   Unless you're deeply cynical as John C. de Vorac is and say,
[01:53:46.140 --> 01:53:47.700]   it's all you're all screwed anyway.
[01:53:47.700 --> 01:53:48.200]   Yes.
[01:53:48.200 --> 01:53:49.900]   And actually, Jolie's pretty cynical, too.
[01:53:49.900 --> 01:53:50.940]   I'm not politicized about it.
[01:53:50.940 --> 01:53:53.340]   It just feels like the Wild West.
[01:53:53.340 --> 01:53:55.620]   What do you think about this whole dish thing, by the way?
[01:53:55.620 --> 01:53:56.460]   Isn't this great?
[01:53:56.460 --> 01:53:56.960]   Wow.
[01:53:56.960 --> 01:53:57.780]   But also, we're--
[01:53:57.780 --> 01:53:58.300]   Speaking of Wild West.
[01:53:58.300 --> 01:53:59.540]   The other one, the rich TV's.
[01:53:59.540 --> 01:54:00.820]   And everyone who's under the age of 30
[01:54:00.820 --> 01:54:02.340]   is like, what are you guys talking about?
[01:54:02.340 --> 01:54:03.900]   Because we can keep this crap.
[01:54:03.900 --> 01:54:05.100]   And exactly.
[01:54:05.100 --> 01:54:06.700]   I didn't know that there was any problem
[01:54:06.700 --> 01:54:09.220]   until some comedian made a joke about it on Twitter.
[01:54:09.220 --> 01:54:12.260]   Seriously, it's not on the internet.
[01:54:12.260 --> 01:54:15.260]   Because direct TV pulled-- because of via com
[01:54:15.260 --> 01:54:17.380]   pulled to Comedy Central, all this other stuff.
[01:54:17.380 --> 01:54:19.060]   And then they pulled it off the internet.
[01:54:19.060 --> 01:54:19.580]   It's at all.
[01:54:19.580 --> 01:54:20.620]   It's still on the internet.
[01:54:20.620 --> 01:54:21.940]   OK, so the deal is--
[01:54:21.940 --> 01:54:22.420]   It's the corenting.
[01:54:22.420 --> 01:54:22.940]   --the corenting.
[01:54:22.940 --> 01:54:23.740]   --the definition of the internet.
[01:54:23.740 --> 01:54:25.860]   Cornting is the future of the internet.
[01:54:25.860 --> 01:54:29.700]   So via com, dish and direct TV, having a war over how much
[01:54:29.700 --> 01:54:32.820]   the satellite companies are going to pay via com for their--
[01:54:32.820 --> 01:54:33.820]   This happens all the time.
[01:54:33.820 --> 01:54:33.820]   Yeah.
[01:54:33.820 --> 01:54:35.100]   And I should point out, by the way,
[01:54:35.100 --> 01:54:37.740]   that the satellite company just passes it along to consumers.
[01:54:37.740 --> 01:54:38.660]   It's not like this.
[01:54:38.660 --> 01:54:39.740]   I'm out of their pocket.
[01:54:39.740 --> 01:54:42.820]   So via com pulls all this stuff off of direct TV.
[01:54:42.820 --> 01:54:44.580]   Direct TV puts up a banner that says
[01:54:44.580 --> 01:54:47.140]   "Viacom is the bad guy and has taken this off."
[01:54:47.140 --> 01:54:49.060]   I love those crawlers.
[01:54:49.060 --> 01:54:51.620]   Do you remember Winter Mitchell from Tech TV?
[01:54:51.620 --> 01:54:53.420]   She had this thing on Facebook that said--
[01:54:53.420 --> 01:54:54.900]   And it was a picture of all the crawlers
[01:54:54.900 --> 01:54:55.900]   that we're trying to compete.
[01:54:55.900 --> 01:54:58.220]   And she says, like watching mom and dad fight.
[01:54:58.220 --> 01:55:00.460]   I just want my comedy central.
[01:55:00.460 --> 01:55:03.140]   The dish one was my favorite since I have the dish.
[01:55:03.140 --> 01:55:07.260]   It says AMC is we're dropping AMC because nobody watches it.
[01:55:07.260 --> 01:55:08.260]   What?
[01:55:08.260 --> 01:55:09.460]   Are you kidding me?
[01:55:09.460 --> 01:55:10.380]   Wow.
[01:55:10.380 --> 01:55:11.020]   Nugly.
[01:55:11.020 --> 01:55:11.740]   Wow.
[01:55:11.740 --> 01:55:12.740]   Meanwhile, Ariel--
[01:55:12.740 --> 01:55:14.420]   Meanwhile, Breaking Bad is on AMC tonight.
[01:55:14.420 --> 01:55:16.180]   And I think a few people might watch that.
[01:55:16.180 --> 01:55:17.460]   Yes, I think is going to be--
[01:55:17.460 --> 01:55:17.900]   Right.
[01:55:17.900 --> 01:55:19.100]   So this interesting difference--
[01:55:19.100 --> 01:55:20.620]   By the way, that's the timing of this.
[01:55:20.620 --> 01:55:21.900]   Nobody watches it.
[01:55:21.900 --> 01:55:24.700]   The biggest show of the year debuts its fifth season tonight.
[01:55:24.700 --> 01:55:25.180]   Yeah.
[01:55:25.180 --> 01:55:27.060]   So AMC says, we're just going to put it on our site.
[01:55:27.060 --> 01:55:27.860]   Come on over and watch.
[01:55:27.860 --> 01:55:28.300]   Good.
[01:55:28.300 --> 01:55:29.460]   Meanwhile, Comedy Central.
[01:55:29.460 --> 01:55:30.740]   Not available online.
[01:55:30.740 --> 01:55:31.500]   Because if we can't show--
[01:55:31.500 --> 01:55:32.540]   How stupid is that?
[01:55:32.540 --> 01:55:34.060]   That is crazy.
[01:55:34.060 --> 01:55:34.540]   They pulled it--
[01:55:34.540 --> 01:55:38.660]   That's because some of Redstone is a real son of a bitch.
[01:55:38.660 --> 01:55:41.020]   And I have to tell you that they may say it's about fees.
[01:55:41.020 --> 01:55:43.380]   But really, this is a dispute over how much
[01:55:43.380 --> 01:55:45.340]   these cable channels could put on the internet
[01:55:45.340 --> 01:55:47.660]   versus how much is on Direct TV.
[01:55:47.660 --> 01:55:49.380]   Direct TV is not happy with the fact
[01:55:49.380 --> 01:55:51.900]   that Comedy Central puts so much content on the internet.
[01:55:51.900 --> 01:55:53.660]   That's really what this fight is all about.
[01:55:53.660 --> 01:55:56.300]   And for your court cutter, you should pay close attention
[01:55:56.300 --> 01:55:58.340]   to this, because that's what it comes down to.
[01:55:58.340 --> 01:56:01.380]   Truth is, content creators wanted to deliver it direct to you.
[01:56:01.380 --> 01:56:02.380]   That's in their interest.
[01:56:02.380 --> 01:56:03.780]   They don't care the content.
[01:56:03.780 --> 01:56:05.540]   It's the people like the cable companies
[01:56:05.540 --> 01:56:06.940]   and the satellite companies who say,
[01:56:06.940 --> 01:56:09.460]   no, no, we want to be the gatekeeper of all this content.
[01:56:09.460 --> 01:56:10.500]   We want it to come through us.
[01:56:10.500 --> 01:56:12.820]   If it doesn't come through us, it doesn't go on the internet.
[01:56:12.820 --> 01:56:15.100]   And that's why I don't get Comedy Central pulling this off
[01:56:15.100 --> 01:56:15.780]   the internet.
[01:56:15.780 --> 01:56:16.740]   I think AMC is right.
[01:56:16.740 --> 01:56:17.900]   Put it on the internet.
[01:56:17.900 --> 01:56:20.180]   Fine.
[01:56:20.180 --> 01:56:21.180]   Go ahead, Direct TV.
[01:56:21.180 --> 01:56:21.980]   Pull this off.
[01:56:21.980 --> 01:56:24.100]   This is just promote court cutting.
[01:56:24.100 --> 01:56:27.700]   Meanwhile, Ariel gets to continue.
[01:56:27.700 --> 01:56:28.620]   Ariel.
[01:56:28.620 --> 01:56:29.060]   What?
[01:56:29.060 --> 01:56:29.580]   Yeah, Ariel.
[01:56:29.580 --> 01:56:30.860]   I thought they were out of business.
[01:56:30.860 --> 01:56:32.060]   No, they get to continue.
[01:56:32.060 --> 01:56:33.100]   Oh, no, no, they get to continue.
[01:56:33.100 --> 01:56:35.700]   They get to continue while the lawsuit continues.
[01:56:35.700 --> 01:56:37.100]   Oh, I thought they were like folding a shop.
[01:56:37.100 --> 01:56:38.220]   No, no, no, no.
[01:56:38.220 --> 01:56:39.540]   No, they're happy campers.
[01:56:39.540 --> 01:56:42.780]   So Ariel is a very strange startup in New York City.
[01:56:42.780 --> 01:56:44.100]   We're very dealer.
[01:56:44.100 --> 01:56:44.740]   Yeah.
[01:56:44.740 --> 01:56:46.740]   Well, they have little antennas everywhere, right?
[01:56:46.740 --> 01:56:47.460]   How does this work?
[01:56:47.460 --> 01:56:48.220]   It's very strange.
[01:56:48.220 --> 01:56:50.180]   Over the air feeds, right?
[01:56:50.180 --> 01:56:52.940]   And each individual user has their own antenna.
[01:56:52.940 --> 01:56:53.940]   Of their own physical antenna.
[01:56:53.940 --> 01:56:54.900]   Little bitty one.
[01:56:54.900 --> 01:56:56.660]   Then they can access that.
[01:56:56.660 --> 01:56:57.940]   It's such a weird-- it makes you feel like there's
[01:56:57.940 --> 01:56:58.660]   some weird font on it.
[01:56:58.660 --> 01:57:00.060]   I wrote a column about this.
[01:57:00.060 --> 01:57:00.660]   You can read it.
[01:57:00.660 --> 01:57:02.340]   It's in one of the PC, Mag, or Mark,
[01:57:02.340 --> 01:57:02.980]   or Watch I Can Never Run.
[01:57:02.980 --> 01:57:04.300]   So I thought they were out of business.
[01:57:04.300 --> 01:57:05.860]   So they want to stay.
[01:57:05.860 --> 01:57:07.740]   And just to continue for people don't know what it is.
[01:57:07.740 --> 01:57:09.820]   And then you can access that over the air,
[01:57:09.820 --> 01:57:13.220]   antenna-fed content via the internet anywhere.
[01:57:13.220 --> 01:57:14.660]   Buy your little tiny antenna.
[01:57:14.660 --> 01:57:15.940]   Yeah, because you own the antenna.
[01:57:15.940 --> 01:57:16.140]   Right.
[01:57:16.140 --> 01:57:17.260]   It makes logical sense to me.
[01:57:17.260 --> 01:57:19.020]   All it is is a long wire.
[01:57:19.020 --> 01:57:19.980]   There's no rule against--
[01:57:19.980 --> 01:57:20.420]   All tubes.
[01:57:20.420 --> 01:57:22.540]   Do you have your antenna on the--
[01:57:22.540 --> 01:57:23.060]   the roof?
[01:57:23.060 --> 01:57:24.020]   You run a wire.
[01:57:24.020 --> 01:57:25.260]   So it's maybe 30 feet.
[01:57:25.260 --> 01:57:27.820]   So whether it be 30 feet and 2,500 miles,
[01:57:27.820 --> 01:57:28.740]   is there a difference?
[01:57:28.740 --> 01:57:29.300]   I don't think so.
[01:57:29.300 --> 01:57:29.660]   Better rule it.
[01:57:29.660 --> 01:57:33.380]   Rejudge rejects the broadcasters' request.
[01:57:33.380 --> 01:57:34.100]   There's a stay.
[01:57:34.100 --> 01:57:35.340]   Ariel continues.
[01:57:35.340 --> 01:57:37.060]   Barry Diller says, yeah, we're going
[01:57:37.060 --> 01:57:40.260]   to be in every city in the United States soon.
[01:57:40.260 --> 01:57:43.060]   Right now, you can only get an account if you're in New York.
[01:57:43.060 --> 01:57:45.060]   And it's only over the air, right?
[01:57:45.060 --> 01:57:45.460]   Yeah.
[01:57:45.460 --> 01:57:45.780]   Yeah.
[01:57:45.780 --> 01:57:47.100]   But that's the thing that cables cutters need.
[01:57:47.100 --> 01:57:48.100]   That's just the beginning of the end.
[01:57:48.100 --> 01:57:49.540]   No, but that's all we need.
[01:57:49.540 --> 01:57:51.420]   We can get everything else on the internet.
[01:57:51.420 --> 01:57:54.220]   If we just get the live over the air broadcast,
[01:57:54.220 --> 01:57:55.580]   we're done, right?
[01:57:55.580 --> 01:57:58.220]   I think those are the reasons that you would leave your house,
[01:57:58.220 --> 01:57:58.740]   though.
[01:57:58.740 --> 01:57:59.860]   You want sports?
[01:57:59.860 --> 01:58:01.620]   You want the Academy Awards.
[01:58:01.620 --> 01:58:03.540]   You want-- you don't want the Academy Awards?
[01:58:03.540 --> 01:58:05.060]   You look like an Oscar fan.
[01:58:05.060 --> 01:58:06.020]   Oh, I forgot.
[01:58:06.020 --> 01:58:08.620]   You're a beautiful young woman in an old man's body.
[01:58:08.620 --> 01:58:09.620]   Oh.
[01:58:09.620 --> 01:58:10.300]   That's John.
[01:58:10.300 --> 01:58:10.980]   I'm sorry.
[01:58:10.980 --> 01:58:13.260]   You're an old man in a beautiful young woman's body.
[01:58:13.260 --> 01:58:13.700]   You nailed it, Leo.
[01:58:13.700 --> 01:58:14.940]   That is me.
[01:58:14.940 --> 01:58:16.620]   I want to thank John D. D. D. D. D. D.
[01:58:16.620 --> 01:58:18.780]   The beautiful young woman in an old man's body.
[01:58:18.780 --> 01:58:19.660]   I like it.
[01:58:19.660 --> 01:58:22.140]   At ChannelDivorect.com, no, agendashow.com.
[01:58:22.140 --> 01:58:23.740]   He is everywhere.
[01:58:23.740 --> 01:58:25.180]   You got to follow him on the Twitter as well.
[01:58:25.180 --> 01:58:27.180]   I knew there was a reason you and Victoria Riccognio
[01:58:27.180 --> 01:58:28.020]   were such good friends.
[01:58:28.020 --> 01:58:29.740]   No, agendashow.com.
[01:58:29.740 --> 01:58:30.500]   Did you mention that?
[01:58:30.500 --> 01:58:32.020]   I didn't hear you because you're making fun of me.
[01:58:32.020 --> 01:58:34.380]   No, agendashow.com.
[01:58:34.380 --> 01:58:35.340]   Yeah, I mentioned it.
[01:58:35.340 --> 01:58:35.980]   OK.
[01:58:35.980 --> 01:58:36.980]   Several times.
[01:58:36.980 --> 01:58:37.500]   You did?
[01:58:37.500 --> 01:58:37.980]   Yes.
[01:58:37.980 --> 01:58:38.900]   Well, I'm an old man.
[01:58:38.900 --> 01:58:39.620]   Yes, I know.
[01:58:39.620 --> 01:58:40.900]   I can't remember anything.
[01:58:40.900 --> 01:58:41.300]   Yeah.
[01:58:41.300 --> 01:58:41.980]   What was it again?
[01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:42.420]   Yeah.
[01:58:42.420 --> 01:58:43.020]   Anyway.
[01:58:43.020 --> 01:58:45.620]   Becky Worley is a jock in a beautiful woman's body.
[01:58:45.620 --> 01:58:47.500]   You don't play rugby anymore, though.
[01:58:47.500 --> 01:58:50.340]   Parenting is my full-time sport, and it is full contact.
[01:58:50.340 --> 01:58:52.100]   You know, I think those small children probably
[01:58:52.100 --> 01:58:52.980]   much like rugby football.
[01:58:52.980 --> 01:58:54.020]   Yes, they are.
[01:58:54.020 --> 01:58:56.180]   They injure me regularly.
[01:58:56.180 --> 01:58:58.700]   It's great to see you catch her on Yahoo.
[01:58:58.700 --> 01:58:59.180]   Yep.
[01:58:59.180 --> 01:58:59.900]   Upgrade your life.
[01:58:59.900 --> 01:59:02.100]   Upgrade your life on GMA from time to time.
[01:59:02.100 --> 01:59:03.660]   Is it like the housewife?
[01:59:03.660 --> 01:59:04.160]   No.
[01:59:04.160 --> 01:59:06.380]   You had to test stuff, you know, caffeinated pants.
[01:59:06.380 --> 01:59:08.480]   You're still doing that.
[01:59:08.480 --> 01:59:09.920]   Snake repellent.
[01:59:09.920 --> 01:59:13.520]   Last week, I ate 17 bowls of cereal in one morning.
[01:59:13.520 --> 01:59:15.300]   Oh, my god.
[01:59:15.300 --> 01:59:15.800]   What?
[01:59:15.800 --> 01:59:18.500]   I flew to LA and had a brow makeover.
[01:59:18.500 --> 01:59:19.500]   Wait a minute.
[01:59:19.500 --> 01:59:21.960]   I think they've talked about beasting facials
[01:59:21.960 --> 01:59:22.940]   they want me to test.
[01:59:22.940 --> 01:59:24.480]   I'm like, 17.
[01:59:24.480 --> 01:59:25.520]   What kind of cereal?
[01:59:25.520 --> 01:59:27.440]   Oh, it was the knockoff cereal.
[01:59:27.440 --> 01:59:29.160]   Did you take the total challenge?
[01:59:29.160 --> 01:59:30.720]   No, you know all the knockoff cereals?
[01:59:30.720 --> 01:59:31.220]   Yeah.
[01:59:31.220 --> 01:59:32.480]   So they're-- you know, in the bags,
[01:59:32.480 --> 01:59:34.960]   they're 50% cheaper than your Cheerios or your Fruit Loops
[01:59:34.960 --> 01:59:35.460]   or whatever.
[01:59:35.460 --> 01:59:36.680]   Yeah, like dog food.
[01:59:36.680 --> 01:59:37.180]   Yeah.
[01:59:37.180 --> 01:59:38.280]   And so how do they taste?
[01:59:38.280 --> 01:59:39.360]   What's the comparison?
[01:59:39.360 --> 01:59:42.080]   I became a Fruit Loop connoisseur in one morning.
[01:59:42.080 --> 01:59:43.160]   So?
[01:59:43.160 --> 01:59:45.320]   Fruit Loops, got a by-brand name.
[01:59:45.320 --> 01:59:48.160]   Honey Nut Cheerios, absolutely the off-brands are great.
[01:59:48.160 --> 01:59:51.440]   Raisin brand, I found indistinguishable from the off-brand.
[01:59:51.440 --> 01:59:53.520]   News you can use this week on Twitter.
[01:59:53.520 --> 01:59:54.760]   I've been the wrong line of work.
[01:59:54.760 --> 01:59:55.680]   I swear to god.
[01:59:55.680 --> 01:59:57.240]   Would you eat 17 bowls of cereal?
[01:59:57.240 --> 01:59:58.400]   If I could get paid for it?
[01:59:58.400 --> 01:59:59.440]   What a story.
[01:59:59.440 --> 02:00:00.280]   Absolutely.
[02:00:00.280 --> 02:00:01.200]   We're going to talk.
[02:00:01.200 --> 02:00:03.600]   Jolie Odell, venturebeat.com.
[02:00:03.600 --> 02:00:06.280]   And you are also on the Twitter as Jolie Odell.
[02:00:06.280 --> 02:00:07.280]   She's fabulous.
[02:00:07.280 --> 02:00:08.360]   She's such a keeper.
[02:00:08.360 --> 02:00:09.280]   Oh, thank you.
[02:00:09.280 --> 02:00:09.760]   Here we go.
[02:00:09.760 --> 02:00:10.760]   I think you're fabulous.
[02:00:10.760 --> 02:00:11.320]   This is good.
[02:00:11.320 --> 02:00:11.840]   Oh, no.
[02:00:11.840 --> 02:00:13.040]   But you're like, you know what?
[02:00:13.040 --> 02:00:14.120]   You fight with her.
[02:00:14.120 --> 02:00:15.320]   I like it.
[02:00:15.320 --> 02:00:16.880]   It's really good.
[02:00:16.880 --> 02:00:18.960]   And when we get John and her in the same room,
[02:00:18.960 --> 02:00:21.560]   it's like, I feel like I'm in crossfire.
[02:00:21.560 --> 02:00:22.840]   Thank you for being here.
[02:00:22.840 --> 02:00:25.320]   We do the show every Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m.
[02:00:25.320 --> 02:00:27.240]   Pacific 6 p.m. Eastern time.
[02:00:27.240 --> 02:00:30.200]   That's 2,200 UTC on Twitter.tv.
[02:00:30.200 --> 02:00:32.120]   But, you know, on demand, always available.
[02:00:32.120 --> 02:00:33.520]   We don't restrict this.
[02:00:33.520 --> 02:00:36.840]   We don't have any deals with cable companies or satellite companies.
[02:00:36.840 --> 02:00:37.280]   Yet.
[02:00:37.280 --> 02:00:39.280]   Ever for that very reason.
[02:00:39.280 --> 02:00:41.840]   Because we think the internet is a pretty darn good way
[02:00:41.840 --> 02:00:43.840]   of transmitting information.
[02:00:43.840 --> 02:00:46.160]   By the way, Captain Crunch, brand name or off brand name.
[02:00:46.160 --> 02:00:47.640]   I didn't taste that one.
[02:00:47.640 --> 02:00:48.720]   I'm getting the sugar cereals.
[02:00:48.720 --> 02:00:50.840]   They have like 50% more sugar.
[02:00:50.840 --> 02:00:53.920]   And it took the foodiness out of the loops.
[02:00:53.920 --> 02:00:54.440]   Too sweet.
[02:00:54.440 --> 02:00:58.640]   Another twin.
[02:00:58.640 --> 02:01:00.640]   That is amazing.
[02:01:00.640 --> 02:01:03.640]   Oh, wow.
[02:01:03.640 --> 02:01:06.360]   Oh, my God.
[02:01:06.360 --> 02:01:07.640]   That's a lot of brain.
[02:01:07.640 --> 02:01:10.640]   I am just, I don't know what to say.
[02:01:10.640 --> 02:01:11.640]   Baby.
[02:01:11.640 --> 02:01:12.640]   Two on the Twitter.
[02:01:12.640 --> 02:01:13.640]   All right.
[02:01:13.640 --> 02:01:14.640]   Two on the Twitter.
[02:01:14.640 --> 02:01:15.640]   Baby.
[02:01:15.640 --> 02:01:16.640]   Two on the Twitter.
[02:01:16.640 --> 02:01:17.640]   All right.
[02:01:17.640 --> 02:01:19.200]   Oh, one more thing.
[02:01:19.200 --> 02:01:20.080]   I almost forgot.
[02:01:20.080 --> 02:01:22.960]   Tomorrow, noon Pacific 3 p.m. Eastern time.
[02:01:22.960 --> 02:01:24.720]   1,700 UTC.
[02:01:24.720 --> 02:01:27.080]   It's Father Robert Balaser.
[02:01:27.080 --> 02:01:29.760]   And this week in Enterprise Tech, a brand new show on Twitch.
[02:01:29.760 --> 02:01:32.480]   And Father Robert Balaser, the host of one of the newest shows
[02:01:32.480 --> 02:01:36.160]   on the Twitch network, "Twiet," this week in Enterprise Tech.
[02:01:36.160 --> 02:01:37.960]   A lot of people have asked me what exactly
[02:01:37.960 --> 02:01:39.920]   does Enterprise Tech cover?
[02:01:39.920 --> 02:01:41.840]   Well, I could tell you.
[02:01:41.840 --> 02:01:42.680]   But I'd rather show--
[02:01:42.680 --> 02:01:52.760]   This is the I/O saying.
[02:01:52.760 --> 02:01:53.920]   I'm not getting bored of it.
[02:01:53.920 --> 02:01:56.920]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:01:56.920 --> 02:02:06.600]   And how many combinations are in IPD 6?
[02:02:06.600 --> 02:02:07.680]   I remember correctly.
[02:02:07.680 --> 02:02:10.560]   I think it's about 340 undecesalions.
[02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:16.360]   Deeper, take me up.
[02:02:22.640 --> 02:02:24.800]   Now, we're going to do a full review on the next year,
[02:02:24.800 --> 02:02:28.880]   3,200, Regenaz, which is the Monster Array, the 12-day array.
[02:02:28.880 --> 02:02:36.000]   So stay tabbed for this week in Enterprise Tech.
[02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:42.000]   Every Monday at noon PST, missing it, would be a sin.
[02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.500]   (zooming)
