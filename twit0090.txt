[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.360]   This is Twit and we apologize for missing a show last week
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.160]   and then a show two weeks ago but we've got a great cast and a great set of stories to talk about
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.320]   so you'll be okay I promise it's going to be alright.
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.240]   John C. Devorak is here from devorak.org/blog.
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.200]   Hi John.
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.080]   Hello.
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.720]   John was John and Will Harris who is also here from willharris.co.uk.
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.880]   We're here last week.
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.720]   John said you had to send a wire?
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.480]   A wire?
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.360]   You said I'll have to leave early, I have to send a wire.
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.560]   Oh yeah money transfer.
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.080]   Send it to 1968?
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.600]   Can you still send wires?
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.640]   Yeah.
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.240]   You have to go to the bank though, you can't get western union to do that.
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.320]   Well you can actually have western union to send money but it's not the same as a bank transfer.
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.000]   Sometimes if you do some sort of deals you have to do money transfer so the easiest way to get
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.280]   this cost a lot but it's the easiest way to move money from point A to point B.
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.040]   John do you run an international drug cartel?
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.160]   I wouldn't be using money wires that's for sure.
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.560]   We're not.
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.560]   We're not.
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.040]   We're not.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.360]   All cash.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.200]   That's a cash business.
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.400]   Some other voices have been heard from Merlin Mann from 43 folders in the new Merlin show.com.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.920]   It's the not the new Merlin show.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.280]   It's the Merlin show.
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.440]   Now I got to go buy another domain every time you do this.
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.320]   The new Merlin show.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.000]   I got to go mop up and buy a domain.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.160]   Yeah I should have been called the new Merlin show.
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.840]   All right here I got a good idea.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.360]   As if there were a Merlin show.
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.200]   Are you going to you got till Sunday?
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.720]   As if there were a Merlin show and now this is the new Merlin show.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.280]   Actually you know this one's so much better than the previous Merlin show.
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.040]   See it's not even a mumper.
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.360]   And then you'll have people looking for the old Merlin show.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.280]   Oh there's another one he needs the old Merlin show.
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.240]   Oh great next to me.
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.760]   Sorry.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.560]   This is my go daddy gets like you don't do it I will.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:38.960]   Yeah and Andy Anaco is here who is very wisely decided not to be Anaco.com.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.160]   I believe it or not it was years before I reserve that domain because I figure that
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:47.280]   who the hell is going to be able to spell it even if they do want an habit from me.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.560]   I still have to look it up every time I send you an email I must confess.
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.760]   It's a security feature.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.000]   But you know what he's got a great URL cwob.com.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.960]   Yes the colossal waste of bandwidth.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.680]   I like to I like to deliver what I promise in terms of web content.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.400]   Now there's yellow text but then there's that's your kind of like your blog right.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.720]   Yes that's my blog it's written complete my use my own blog software written completely with
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.720]   apple script and now I'm starting to get a small yeah exactly I wrote my first blog app in 1995
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:23.040]   before there was such a word and I've just been adding more and more features to it ever since.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.760]   Although I don't realize it and you want to commercialize it because it's apple script you can't.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.120]   Exactly well because I don't want to support it.
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.200]   It's bad enough that I have to support user number one you know and if you think Steve Jobs is a big
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.280]   jerk to write software for it you know think about having need to say how come I can't do track
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.640]   backs only because it would take us 10 days to write the software for it.
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.240]   Oh that's all.
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.240]   I didn't realize this is running an apple script so it's not is it running on a Mac in your
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:54.800]   bedroom? No it's entirely client based it's just running off of an FTP server tied on to
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.080]   friend of mine's T1 that's part of the fun and part of the challenge because I don't really care
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.680]   about or know about actually more of the point writing server side software.
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.120]   So this is in a web server based.
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:12.160]   It's not any you can run it off of your iDISK you can run off of any FTP account it runs completely
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.800]   off apple script as a matter of fact the word the text editor is text edit or be the edit or
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.560]   Microsoft Word or wherever you want to use.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:22.560]   Why don't you throw it into the open source community then you don't have to do anything.
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:28.320]   You know I'm actually thinking about what to do with this code because my users for some reason
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.560]   they I don't know what kind of perfume got dropped in the year three months ago but suddenly
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.000]   they're saying why can't we do comments and how come you don't like this and blah blah blah.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.600]   Yeah I mean that would solve the problem you wouldn't have to do any support because these guys
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.920]   once they learn the code they would start doing it themselves and you'd end up and if it's done
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.560]   with a normal GPL it means it has to be shared you'd end up beefing up your own blog software
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.480]   be great it's brilliant right exactly but but the part the only thing that really has it that
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:56.960]   I'm really hesitant about is that it's the same reason why when like companies need to give me
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.800]   like a confidential briefing they don't get it to come into my office to give it to me because I
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.920]   don't want to see how I live yeah I also don't want to see let people see how I write code it's
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:10.400]   almost as everything is seen underwear and underneath your printer server you know what Bill Gates
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.640]   writes code like that I understand so I guarantee that's the main reason why so much
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:19.680]   software is not open source is pure embarrassment well and you know it's not yeah I don't even
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.800]   think is that so much do you know that it's the guys out there and I don't want to call them weenies
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.480]   but there's a bunch of guys out there that have really nothing better to do than to be
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:34.480]   hypercritical about something that's given to them for free it sounds like that's a Wikipedia
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:42.160]   because I'm one of those hypercritical jerk-offs but generally speaking I'm not that mean you're
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:48.800]   not a weenie about it and and that which reminds me of of Merlin's former biggest fan Brent
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:54.720]   yes Brent yeah what was it my your former number one fan your former biggest fan yeah exactly
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.280]   that's the notion the notional character that everybody has who who now hates everything they do
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:04.480]   it's got a neck beard he kind of sits there next to the dryer and his parents basement makes
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:09.520]   Mountain Dew types types witty retorts he's the guy what does that say about your regular fans
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:16.160]   no no no I like the idea of the neck very very good looking so the thing you think you grow you
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:22.400]   grow in lieu of a jawline well yeah not all of us are lucky enough to have a jaw so hideous did
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:28.560]   you register an act co.com or no I do have an not go.com and the reason why is because I realized that
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:33.440]   I have a cousin in Australia who has a little boy and that it would just plain kill me if one
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.320]   Christmas he wanted to get to not go.com for $30 is a Christmas present so I decided to dash
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.480]   all the hopes of every other not go in the genetic line are there no no no no no no no no
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:48.160]   no there are believe it or not be allowed to be is it an Indian tribe or is it Hawaiian what is
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:52.880]   it we try to we try to spread ourselves rather thickly because it's essential to the survival
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:59.520]   of our planet that one and not go be alive to to slay Balal in 300 years time really it's all for
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:04.640]   you that we're doing this. Thank you Andy. Welcome to this week in genealogy brother.
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:09.200]   I didn't I didn't want to say it to me from a nice open source discussion to some sort of a
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:13.840]   weird thing. I like your openness I really like your open source discussion I think that I think
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:17.760]   you're right on though there's so many I actually have some friends who would like nothing better
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:22.560]   than never have to commit another another another commission into into subversion they would love
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.680]   to open it up and give it away but it's a little bit like the first time you invite the made over
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.600]   you know to come and clean your house. So what do you got exactly and these guys it's Danny
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.520]   Danny O'Brien calls these secret scripts like every geek has these little very embarrassing
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:37.440]   little shell scripts they never want anybody to see and you got to get into the community
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:42.400]   the community would clean it up eventually. Bill Gates code I've seen Bill Gates code there was
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:47.440]   a great book which I think it's out of print Microsoft press printed it but I I highly recommend
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:53.360]   you try to find a used copy. I think it was Barbarians and Bill Gates. No it was a doubt one it was
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:58.640]   Barbarians at the Bill Gates. No Barbarians and Bill Gates. No this one was called the programmers
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:03.200]   at work and they interviewed a bunch of programmers including Charles Simmonie who talked about his
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:07.360]   Hungarian notation but which is fascinating but then Bill Gates was interviewed and they actually
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:12.240]   have code from the original basic he's very proud of that code. Yes you would be talking about
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:16.080]   interviews with 19 programmers who shaped the computer industry by Susan Lambers. You have it.
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:19.760]   Charles Simonian I have it three feet away from me on my bookshelf right now. It's one of my favorite
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:25.040]   books. Let's start reading some code from it. I think Gates's code is in the back but it's
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:31.520]   assembler code of course for 60 502 I think is the first basic. The first basic he had to be
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:37.920]   from 8080. No no no it was my Mazzi 80 it was for the Mazzi. No no it couldn't have been a Z80.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:42.800]   It was for the Mazzi. It would be an 8080. Yeah yeah yeah you're right. Yeah that's exactly right.
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:49.440]   I have to oh here it is he is in the in the appendix a portion of the original source code for 8080
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:54.320]   basic written by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in 1975. I think Paul did most of that coding. There's always
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:58.320]   a debate over that. You've always been on the opinion that Paul did it. Well there's two things
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:02.960]   I'm out of the opinion of. One that Paul did most of that coding and B that the code it wasn't a lot
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:07.360]   of original code in there. It was all taken from deck 10 basic. Oh interesting. Because Bill was
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:13.760]   Bill in at least in that book is very proud of the uh uh uh revenue of the code and the compactness
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:17.520]   of it and how much he was able to get done. I've heard people say this because this is brilliant
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:22.800]   code but so you know you never know. What was the truth about it? Well there's a guy that was at the
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:26.320]   story I'm talking about which is in one of these books and I think it was Barbarians and Bill Gates
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:32.160]   which was written by one of the daughters of the Wagner Ettstrom people. I can't remember which
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:38.240]   one of them. And a guy who used to I guess who married her and he used to be a coder at Microsoft
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:44.160]   and he was taking Bill Gates's code and just shredding it for being just terrible. Oh interesting.
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.480]   Well maybe it was Brent his former biggest fan. We don't know.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.400]   There are large blocks of this large blocks of this are largely available in our faces.
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:57.520]   Tell you what a disappointment is. I'll tell you where there is a problem in this Microsoft's
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:03.680]   one care security suite. Once again now there've been a couple of tests of this AV comparatives
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:11.760]   which is an Austrian project to test the effectiveness of antivirus code ranked it dead last and all
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:15.680]   the products it tested it was the only one to do less than 80 but worse than 80 percent.
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:20.720]   I'm sorry which one was this? Microsoft's own antivirus. Oh yeah right. Windows one care or live
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:29.120]   one care. In fact they're not going to they may not even include it in future tests. It was that
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:33.840]   bad. Virus Bulletin also showed that one care failed to completely protect users of VISTA.
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:42.560]   That's another independent third party comparative test. It scored 91 percent for Windows viruses,
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:47.760]   macros, worms and scripts 79 percent for detecting back-dorts, Trojans and other malware and 82 percent
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:53.600]   for its overall detection rate. So what was the best one they said? I think maybe Kaspersky
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:58.880]   which is of course John's favorite or has been for a long time. Well yeah I think Kaspersky came
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.160]   in like third. There was a couple other ones. You know what I'm using now though I'm using
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:09.600]   you know I used to use Kaspersky but I'm using the free version of AVG. It ain't bad. It's not bad
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:14.400]   it's free and it updates itself and it doesn't pester you for to spend money and it doesn't screw
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:19.360]   up your system and I put it on a number of machines and it just seems to work fine and they have a
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:24.480]   spyware version you have to have to install two of these things. Here's the top. Here's the top.
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:30.000]   By the way the best one only did 99.45 percent so they all missed some viruses. AVK
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:37.280]   don't know what that is. Trustport, Avira, F-Secure which I've lost for a long time.
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:43.600]   Then Kaspersky and E-Scan. Then Symantec which is not the same as Norton I don't think. Then
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:49.600]   NOD32AVG is eighth on that list. Now that's the first free one on that list I think.
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:56.240]   Although F-Secure doesn't have a free DOS-only product. Bitdefender, Fortinet, Avast also free.
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:03.280]   Norman, oh there's the F-Prot that's the free one. McAfee, Dr. Webb and Microsoft at the bottom.
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:10.960]   The community has never gotten together and produced one big Armageddon-style antivirus kit
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:14.320]   that the entire community was going to support and the entire community was kind of kind of
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.600]   bad to get a more clam AV which is an open source antivirus.
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:23.280]   There's a slight backstory here and I think it also explains why the community can't
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:26.480]   get it together. First of all you're dealing with a bunch of the guys who are into this business
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:31.600]   are extremely nerdy and to get these guys to agree on how to do stuff is pretty hard.
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:38.320]   They do have these huge meetings of all these guys and they try to make sure that they all
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:44.960]   have a good product and Microsoft used to be a member of this club of these high-end coders
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:51.520]   and they would all share different kinds of detail and then when Microsoft decided to do
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:56.400]   their own thing I think they were black balls from the group because I had a number of meetings
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:01.760]   with some of these people who did nothing but bitterly complain about Microsoft coming into the game
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:06.560]   after stealing all their ideas and you know because supposedly everybody was opening the
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:11.680]   kimono as it were and telling each other all kinds of secrets and then Microsoft meanwhile has
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:16.080]   taken notes and next thing you know they bring out a product this really steam these guys up.
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.760]   So I wouldn't surprise me if these guys aren't submarineing Microsoft now.
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:24.880]   That by the way the semantic was Norton antivirus so it actually scored fairly high I'm surprised
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:32.480]   because I'm not not been a fan lately of Norton and the AVK I'm trying to find more
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:35.760]   up information about that I'm not familiar with that one but that's the one that that
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:41.600]   won easily it's it's a multi oh wait a minute I'm sorry AVK contains is a multi-engine product
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:47.840]   that contains kaspersky plus a vast the free antivirus so an away kaspersky did win when it was
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:54.640]   it combined with a vast interesting you know Microsoft acquired that antivirus product they
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:55.760]   didn't desire from scratch.
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.000]   True.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:58.320]   Right.
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:02.080]   You know you're right they didn't design it from scratch but they did.
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.640]   But they've obviously updated apparently not much.
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:10.000]   Well you know everything that they buy of course they tend to deteriorate I just
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.640]   think to keep them pointing the finger at Microsoft for doing this but with front page
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:20.640]   that's a good example of a product that they buy it was pretty usable when it when it just was
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:25.040]   just bought and then it over time it just got worse and worse and I don't know what they do
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:27.600]   there but you think that they would make the product better.
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:32.080]   Front page still exists doesn't it go on the way it's been changed in 2007 hasn't it?
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.120]   Yeah they phased it out.
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:36.320]   Something else instead but it's probably just front page of the new name.
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:39.440]   Well I think they're gonna you know they're trying to get everyone to use word to do all
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:40.080]   that stuff now.
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.240]   Oh that's the worst that's the worst.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:47.280]   Well there is good news no security patches on Tuesday so everything must be perfect.
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:51.200]   Oh wait a minute no that's not the case there are in fact at least five vulnerabilities waiting
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.200]   to be fixed but they're not going to fix them.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:58.160]   Don't they also have to send out a patch to get everyone's uh that's been done that was done last
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.280]   or the daylight savings time.
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:03.600]   Yeah daylight savings time and if you're listening to this and you think it's actually 11 it's really
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.440]   midnight just so you know.
[00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:13.360]   Don't know Microsoft and Apple both pushed patches in the last 30 days to fix the daylight
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:14.880]   savings time zones.
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:23.040]   Well talking of Apple patches we've got the new iTunes as are 7.1 which does not a lot.
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:26.720]   Well apparently you know we talked about this in Mac break weekly and by the way we were
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:30.560]   going to make our ground rules since we have two Mac break weekly fellas on here that we
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:35.120]   were going to kind of limit the Mac conversation but in this will this is a a Windows application
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:35.760]   too.
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:38.560]   Yeah we're talking about Windows Windows version.
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.880]   Does the Windows version do that full screen cover flow?
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:41.840]   A must.
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.080]   Don't they have the parity course platform?
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.120]   Apart from the yeah but it what does it?
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.040]   It doesn't still quite work on Vista does it?
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:49.920]   Oh really?
[00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:50.640]   I haven't tried it.
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:51.200]   Well apparently.
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.680]   Oh for Vista yeah they haven't have they patched Vista?
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:55.840]   I thought I saw something that fixed that this week.
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:59.280]   Some of it works but they still haven't fixed the problem where it might trash your
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:00.480]   iPod if you try to update it.
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:01.120]   Okay don't do it.
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.000]   Don't you know.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.920]   Don't do it.
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:04.960]   That's a known issue.
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:05.840]   That's it.
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:06.640]   Yes.
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:08.160]   Yep it's not a fixed issue.
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:12.720]   It's less of a known issue than a way of finally selling some zoom players.
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:18.160]   I interviewed in fact if you want to hear it the Dave Colton from the zoom team on Windows
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:23.920]   Weekly on Friday and he actually you know I have to say and this it's it's you want to
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:28.560]   hate Microsoft it's easy to hate him when it's a monolithic company when it's not real people it's
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:32.720]   easy to say bad things about him but then you meet these guys and they're smart they're funny
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:37.680]   they're intelligent and it's like it's hard it's Dave and then they quit and then they
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:39.120]   right then they get a better job.
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:43.280]   No Dave was great and I think you know he I said I said what what what's
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:48.400]   what's with welcome to the social would you explain it to me and he and he said well he
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:52.560]   was very diplomatic but essentially said yeah you better ask the marketing team what that
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.560]   means because I don't know either.
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:57.840]   Sometimes it just seems like they're the Microsoft and I totally agree with you I went
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:02.400]   on to a Microsoft trip last year and I was just blown away by how intelligent the folks I met were
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:06.480]   but sometimes it just feels like whatever the opposite of a gestalt is where it seems like
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:10.080]   they've got all of these people who are doing this amazing work but the pieces just don't
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:11.840]   sometimes don't seem to fit together.
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:17.520]   I think I think I've always found that Microsoft people at that level to be great it's there's
[00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:22.240]   some layer of management that's a problem and I've had talked to people about this and I've
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:28.240]   discussed it with in some columns which is there's a there's one layer that formed at
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:32.320]   Microsoft and it's always slowly forming I think which I think is corroding the company
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:36.640]   and you can talk to Microsoft people about this and they most of them will agree with it
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:42.480]   of guys who were in the company early and they were heavy duty coders and they you know and
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:47.920]   like most of the really best coders they're very introverted and they burn out I mean they all
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:51.520]   tend to have followed the same pattern they're really good when they're about until they get
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:56.000]   to about 27 years old and it starts to fall apart so by the time they're getting to the 30s they
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.680]   decided they you know they want to be designers and then they move up and they decide out of the
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:05.520]   blue with no experience or skills that they want to be managers and they want to lead projects
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:09.920]   and you end up with this layer of these people that can't manage the way out of a paper sack
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:16.400]   and making decisions in a in a very strange structured company that that were the employee
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:21.440]   and they or the the boss and the and the underling they grade each other on this five point scale
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:25.280]   that's just very complicated they're force rank I think they force rank teams there what's that
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:29.120]   mean right what's that mean it's they they grade basically if you got five people on your team
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:33.280]   two people get a big bonus one person it does okay and two people are encouraged to find other
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:39.440]   opportunities I mean it's I think it's am I wrong I was well yeah you're kind of wrong
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:43.120]   you're not completely right you can you don't if you have a five man team two of them don't get
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:47.520]   fired I mean it depends on how the grading works out when they start to grade each other so they
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:51.040]   end up kissing each other's asses to such an extreme and then they're working for a guy does
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:54.080]   nobody's doing or can't make it this I mean it's not that's certainly not unheard of in the in
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:58.160]   the tech field but I mean it's supposedly that's a again this is I've never worked at Microsoft it's
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:02.240]   just what I hear from people but that's that's within a team now we're not talking within a BU
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:06.880]   we're talking within like the you know the people that are in the next cube so I mean I don't know
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:11.360]   if you're saying that Microsoft eats its young basically well no they it's definitely it's a
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:15.440]   meritocracy and you get they they measure the rings under your eyes each night and see how you're
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:19.680]   doing yeah but that's not you know that's not a meritocracy that's some sort of sick
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:25.200]   suck suck suck democracy I used to use stories that they would notice where you parked in the
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:29.200]   lot because if you didn't come in real early you'd be parking like George Costanza exactly
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:36.560]   excited for the X files this brings it like the X files this brings the conspiracy theories
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:41.120]   actually this brings you back to the movie office space yes which is a movie everyone should go
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:47.520]   see by the way I finally saw idiocracy what you think I liked it I loved it I don't know it I did
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:53.920]   well leave I saw this for the first time on the video wall of the Virgin Megastore in San Francisco
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:57.440]   I stood there for like eight minutes wondering what the hell is this and I wound up buying it
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:01.120]   this it's a it's a really funny movie is it by the same guy did office spaces that yeah and it's
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:07.120]   been buried he did this movie and if you look at it is obviously a high it was not like a you know
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:12.000]   mega budget but it's a high-five it's a high budget movie a lot of CGI very expensive look
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.360]   in CGI it doesn't look like a cheap production by any means it's a really funny story uh and it's
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:22.800]   another one of those things where Ed uh it's a mic judge uh is just a studio it's just that they
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:27.440]   won't even take a chance it came out it's something like eight like something like eight or twelve
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:31.920]   theaters made a hundred grand and then they just buried it oh that's very very critical
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:37.680]   very critical of premise that's such a wonderful premise yeah the premise is tell him Andy
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:41.520]   well basically only say minutes on the video wall
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:48.880]   what's out of your eight minutes he bought it oh yeah okay so so you're you're basically
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:54.560]   dumb and dumber guy from dude where's my car guy from from our generation basically gets gets gets
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:21:00.000]   gets frozen and wakes up exactly cool son then he wakes up centuries centuries later to find out
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.480]   that society because of corporate mass culture has become dumber and dumber and dumber with
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:09.600]   these generation and now he is in fact the super genius we're eating over breeding by
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:13.840]   it's the breeding thing because they mentioned to be you know they show this very insulting scene
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:18.800]   where they have this bunch of hicks that are breeding like crazy and this one girl who has to be the
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:23.360]   or woman sorry that has to be the the career woman and doesn't want to have a baby until they're
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:28.000]   older and they never have a baby and that whole group people die off after thousands of years or
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.960]   hundreds of years and they and all the dummies take over and they then they get so dumb that
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:37.440]   they're you know it's just hilarious they're watering their crops with Gatorade because this
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:42.240]   corporation is mr i made it i've just put it on my blockbuster cue it's number one and and the
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:46.160]   and the most the most popular tv show is just some guy getting hit in the groin over and over
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:52.640]   and exceedingly more and probably that's youtube over and over and over they predicted youtube
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:56.080]   well no they're no they're no kitties going to the toilet while playing the super mario theme on
[00:21:56.080 --> 00:22:00.400]   the 12 stinker tars without boiling down a guy's getting hit in the groin they don't worry you got
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:04.160]   all boils down to that when you watch it did you did you end up feeling i ended up feeling kind of
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:08.560]   melancholy because of how incredibly true so much of what they were talking about already is that's
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:12.480]   why they didn't make it in the full release no i didn't make you because there's some in
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:16.640]   offended somebody and that you know i think it could have been a cult classic i think it would have
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:21.360]   taken off well well it probably will be most cult classics and not cult classics in the
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:26.080]   movie theater that's what i know i'm so i guess i should have been an underground hit i mean i
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:31.200]   think and i don't mean a cult classic like you know eraser head i mean something that's like you know
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:34.400]   that would have made money i think it would have made money suddenly would have earned back yeah
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:38.640]   if it would have been given a chance but you know and this guy needs to get more work because
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:43.600]   his stuff is great meanwhile they're like screwing him over left and right he gets a movie every two
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:48.640]   or three years he should be making a movie a year this guy he's really funny he's to team up with
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:53.120]   the serenity guy and maybe they could do something to get all then we'll never see anything i think
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:58.720]   i get screwed all the time to weeding josh weeding josh weeding yeah yeah he's a geek hero
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:03.920]   yeah he is but i mean he still he doesn't get enough where i mean you know his stuff is the same
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:08.400]   thing it's really good stuff okay but he is responsible for the ending to marvel civil war
[00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:12.160]   series so i really really have to ask him for twenty dollars of the hundred dollars i was
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:19.200]   gonna give him i'm starting to sound like brent what is the marvel civil war series i'm sorry i don't
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:22.480]   have a mike comic books is this the cap and i don't think you got a comic book guy voice
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:28.160]   no no i really maryland does it's below that we need the frank voice
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:34.560]   there is a there is a september eleventh style disaster in kennedyke that killed several civilians
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:38.800]   including a elementary school full of children what a battle against a super villain group goes
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:44.240]   horribly awry the the populace starts to insist that superheroes become accountable for their
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:49.120]   actions and passes the superhero registration act by which sounds a little more like the professor
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:55.360]   yeah professor frank that's who it is frank you just got a screech a little it's a little like the
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:24:00.880]   incredibles it's sort of like uh right in the sense that the superheroes are kind of called to uh
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:05.760]   account for themselves as a idea right and basically this is a measure that like the entire united
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:10.720]   states citizenry with with reason support because you know there's a reason why you can't just go out
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:14.400]   and buy a handgun and shoot it off without getting a permit being checked out and saying yes it's
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:18.880]   okay for you to be using this thing so ironman is one of the people who supports the registration
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:22.400]   act and chiefly he does it by way of saying well look we don't want the government
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:26.880]   making us all into police officers and controlling us if we set this up and maintaining this ourselves
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:30.880]   as a community we'll be able to get things done faster meanwhile captain america doesn't like the
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:34.880]   idea that everybody with superheroes has to tell the government what your seat your identity is
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:38.480]   and basically essentially they kind of they kind of sorry i'm gonna have to just turn
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:44.960]   over all the cards and play the rat home because there's just no way waiting for somebody to stop
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:48.400]   what do i win what do i win i was wondering if he's gonna take a brat
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:53.600]   handy man even i don't open rat holes that day that was good but but but does you take it i'm
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:57.680]   a full circle mic judge is responsible for the bad ending of this
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:03.360]   you know joss joss we see responsible uh no that was swept in i will make this 20 seconds long
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:06.400]   there was a big meeting with their discuss and be a marvel where they're discussing how this is
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:11.200]   going to go they had all their characters together joss weeding swand in for 10 minutes and i know
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:16.320]   there's the stupidest way to end this and that's how they did it well we can blame joss weeding that
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:22.640]   well maybe you know maybe joss weeding everybody is a uh all right quickly back to tech
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:27.760]   quick quick uh dig i got one i got okay let's talk about the samson finally somebody's shipping
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:31.600]   these hybrid hard hard drives you've been you've been dying to see one of these
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:37.840]   uh do you have one uh yet will or is this just something you're writing about no we just uh we
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:42.880]   saw that they started shipping them we haven't actually seen one yet i've seen like i've seen
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:48.000]   laptop hard disk drives that are entirely flash right but this is not that this combines flash
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.960]   with those platters yeah this is like a pretty lame one i want the ones designed for the desk
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:26:00.480]   tops that has like 500 gigabytes or terabyte and four or five gigs of uh splash memory and that
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:05.920]   is supposed to be the device that will make vista sing because vista is actually designed to run
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:11.120]   we're waiting i'm telling you it's well you can laugh all you want but the i run at the
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:15.920]   impression that that's what makes vista work vista's gonna sing step in time step in time
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:21.680]   i'm amazed that they don't put that on the side of the vista box once we get this imaginary
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:28.400]   technology working fine you'll love it hey i'm just reporting back i got nothing to do with it i'm
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:33.920]   just telling you what they're telling me you saw the ibm guy who said that he believed that the the
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:40.160]   vista really for for it to sing required four gigs of ram wow yeah no i think that's true too
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:44.160]   so four gigs of ram do you guys have like an act what what on a map we've got like an activity
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:49.280]   viewer can you guys like would you wait i see your resources you're filling up two or three gigs of
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:54.240]   of ram will be here's why he says that it's actually something that vista does it's new it it it will
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:27:00.000]   load into memory uh more stuff if if the memory is there it essentially will run out of ram not
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.600]   merely the operation of your applications everything will run out of ram if there's the ram there and
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:08.000]   it makes a big difference apparently so now do you try putting a flash disk into the usb drive
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   because that does really prove have you know that's the ready boost as opposed to the ready drive
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.800]   have you noticed a difference yeah actually especially application switching a little
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:20.640]   little housekeeping things seem to work better i'm actually not i don't have a whole lot of complaints
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:24.880]   about vistas if it's an improvement over xp i actually like it and is one of my running os is
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:28.480]   here in the office so i shouldn't complain that much i you know it's funny and john's mentioned
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:34.640]   this before it's the uh the mac guys who seem to like vista the most true i don't know why that is
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:39.920]   weird but true yeah so uh it's just you've told us it's okay to like it because it's just like the
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:44.960]   mac guitar you may like it bbc here's a chance for everybody to do their batting with shaxon's
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:50.960]   sorry will your sis no no will you you're gonna this too yours is good actually it's quite good
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:55.200]   the bbc was the only really major network anywhere in the world that youtube could strike a deal with
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:28:02.080]   apparently it's a bit of a funny deal though isn't it because it's not like we're gonna put loads of bbc
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:08.160]   content on youtube as far as i can tell it's like we're gonna put loads of promos for bbc content
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:13.360]   on youtube what kind of deal is that it's like well awesome so i can go and watch a five-minute
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:19.360]   preview of something and then go across to bbc and watch the full thing in wmv i try to get crazy i
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:24.320]   you know this is when in the first wave of people like npr uh should say organizations like npr
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:27.920]   putting out podcasts that was their approach to everything was like here's four minutes from a
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:32.880]   prarion companion and it's it's maddening and i'm so glad that they finally came around to putting
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:37.520]   out full episodes you know you got shows now like wait wait don't tell me that are seeing an audience
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:41.760]   base but i mean but i think of wait wait in particular because that's a show that i just have to
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:46.000]   suspect never had anywhere near the audience that they've got now and i mean you don't make this
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.600]   stuff great by putting out what are they saying here clips like trailers and short features you
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:54.880]   know what the nature of this was it was when the they put a family guy podcast up and it was
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:29:01.600]   one of the writers reading a synopsis of the plot yeah without the job like like your local
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:06.960]   library reading the paper of the vision impaired well i think the problem with the bbc thing in
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:12.800]   particular is that their reluctance to put like full programs up on things like youtube because
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:18.160]   youtube is accessible from all over the world and theoretically that stuff is being paid for by the
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:22.240]   british public and there's a survey that they did last year that said that british people would
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:26.880]   be annoyed if they felt like they were subsidizing the rest of the world can't be annoyed
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:31.680]   well then why do they why do they stream everything unreal you hear that the the
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:38.480]   not be annoyed the flaw in this is oh my god what what have we done everybody in the world
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:45.280]   can now see the bbc oh what a horrible thing you wouldn't want to put bbc worldwide out there oh
[00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:52.480]   we'll think about all that we need bbc worldwide available worldwide holy crap oh man the exchange
[00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:57.440]   rate of american to the pound is two to one believe me we're paying for it at some level
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:03.200]   we know that you owe a service you're not even annoyed don't bring up the two to one thing that's
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:09.520]   really galling that's awesome what's there like when you're floating around here just load up
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:16.000]   are you saying that the pound is worth less than the dollar somehow is that what you're saying here
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.400]   no it's just worth twice as much as it should be worth so when he comes over here he can buy up
[00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:25.200]   the place he's buying lunch and dinner and beer for everybody and it's not costing them a penny
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:30.960]   it's awesome and you know if you go to san francisco the place is crawling with french
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:35.360]   brits and german's they're all the dollars you're saying the dollars look at the hipster
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:39.120]   posers so too many of those people they're always walking around their top hats and monicals oh
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:43.920]   can i have another scone don't you have any take of not being chimneys
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:49.120]   possibly swim quit sweeping my chimney i say i don't need your buying power
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:55.680]   what do you like to do this just a torment will and it seems to be i have even one thing i
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:31:00.160]   have started to know maybe that's my superhero power so i can sweep chimneys in like a single
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:07.200]   second and dream that we need to have a little page that lists everybody's superpower i think
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:11.600]   it's a good idea now let's go on with it apologize let's go on with some more of our content free
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:16.960]   show here all right apple has you do you want some real content apple is filing a patent for the
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:24.640]   iPhone lanyard the lanyard you're kidding me though it's it's i will they're saying that they're
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:29.440]   saying that they're going to build like loads of different stuff into lanyards in the future
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:34.240]   like you can have a lanyard that like flashes with your heart beat when you're like jogging and stuff
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:38.880]   oh that's interesting well you can have a lanyard that actually provides the telephone functionality
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:42.000]   like in the lanyard you can just like plug it into your iPod do you think that's what's
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.880]   going to be because you like the phone all the i lanyard you think that's what steves wearing
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:51.280]   in that uh syrup dishes picture of him at the soccer game that really really fuzzy picture
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:55.440]   you know i could do you see a phone do you see a phone in that picture i'm not the only person
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:32:00.480]   who doesn't see a phone he's wearing his i've pod i had phones or bright white you know it
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:04.640]   so it bugs me because he's at a soccer game for his kid and the poor guy somebody's
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:08.720]   surreptitiously taking pictures of him with their twenty thousand views on that photo twenty
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:13.520]   thousand i visited what i'm concerned about is that he's at his kid's soccer game and he's wearing
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:18.240]   his keynote uniform his superhero suit he should be in a civilian uniform somebody pointed out
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:23.040]   he's gonna figure out that he's not the car can exactly that's all he ever wears is black jeans
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:27.760]   and black bullets did you see the pictures of him um having dinner with Bill Gates the other way
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:32.480]   those are giant tattoo and he's he's wearing the same thing he's caught the black pole neck
[00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:37.280]   yeah well maybe steve jobs is like the dread pirate rovers he has the job for three years
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:42.160]   then he finds someone to take over the mantle and the uniform convince him he steve jobs and apple
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:47.040]   lives and thrives forever and i nominate you to be the official nerd historian of the show
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:56.080]   i like your reference i like your references keep pirate roberts okay um let's see i'm trying
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:33:01.600]   to desperately to find some wonderful stories for you uh playstation home the one thing that
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:08.240]   might save playstation three a home version a small version no it's there it's their new online
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:14.000]   world that's going to challenge second life oh please you know we talked about this last week or a
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:20.160]   couple weeks ago it just sounds familiar it's so so what they're doing is they have like if you
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:24.640]   think of like so it's so many playstation three and they got this big like online connectivity
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:29.040]   and what they're doing is making like a virtual world online like second life be fun that might
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:33.440]   be where you can build your own like home and in your home is like all your achievements from
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:39.680]   the games that you've done and it looks like virtual tv it's called playstation home huh this is
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:43.200]   not this is a tv where you can watch trailers and you can go and interact with people and you can
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:47.680]   invite people into your home and this is their own house that's for fun really much more than
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:52.880]   just like junk it looks more like a shopping mall they have to pay fifteen dollars a month to go
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:57.280]   into the guys it's only we're really excited that you know as well as the playstation home as well
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:01.920]   as like your little home one day there could be like a whole in-game world where like Levi's could
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:06.160]   have a home and Coca-Cola could have a home you could go and visit Levi's and I thought yeah that
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:11.840]   sounds fantastic we're dying out of that house that sounds like a neocracy it does sounds exactly
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:16.880]   you know the one yeah good start looks there's one there's a lot of by the way there's a lot of
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:22.720]   profane humor in idiocracy which also may have accounted for it's being dumped but it's very funny
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:27.920]   funny profane we're not for the kids let's just say the Starbucks develops a new business model
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:32.400]   that's all i think that was i think that that yeah and there's also the you know the the evolution of
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:39.040]   of fudruckers okay you can kind of figure out what it's going to go to but anyway explicit tag
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:46.400]   a week so uh there's been a lot of uh vandalism on second life itself have you heard about the uh
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:52.320]   about the uh liberation front the uh what's what are the avatar liberation front or whatever it is
[00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:57.760]   and they blew up a couple of things which of course is just explosions that are pictures and they
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:03.680]   want it they want rights for the avatars and this kind of thing they want voting rights and
[00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:08.960]   it's crazy people are starving to death right outside their doorstep but no let's get the
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:14.960]   plastic friends some human rights i hate to go yeah and then everybody griefed john edwards
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:21.120]   and then the john edwards the headquarters was blown up apparently or was it was tagged or something
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:25.280]   happened to it i don't know i don't go to this but it isn't that damage to the temporary uh i mean
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:29.200]   does it go doesn't it go away it's not permanent isn't but there's the edwards people were really
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:34.320]   indignant about it weren't they are they they've come to their ladies how do they put pictures of
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:39.520]   explosions on our site yeah what wasn't it something a little bit more toilet humor than that than
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:44.480]   blowing up yeah i think i think it was the flange in a tailor again uh they're good at that
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:48.720]   how do you but like you know you go into this world you go into this world and you want to go in
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:52.720]   there and you basically carpet bag your way into this i you know and then and then you're surprised
[00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:56.160]   that people are kind of treating you in this in this way well that's exactly right i mean
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:36:00.160]   that it's like carpet baggers and the people are saying hey you don't belong in here this is our
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:07.680]   uh weird little geeky paradise here not for you i'll tell you what else isn't for uh
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:14.240]   isn't for you are all the deleted emails that intel accidentally deleted from its court case
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:22.320]   you're so cute when you try to keep us on track but i was trying to segue and keep on topic at
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:26.720]   the same time we owe you a dollar or something for that that was so cute well otherwise we were
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:30.640]   just going to spend the rest of the episode on flange and it's a lot you were your sure putting
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:35.520]   i actually was looking for a story uh and i can't find it but i saw a story about a company that
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:41.520]   wants to its business model is rating second life avatars you know giving them ratings this is
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:48.160]   how they're going to make a huge killing wasn't that like second life escorts uh i don't know
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:54.640]   should we go there what is second life escorts looks like a rate that's all is on second life right
[00:36:54.640 --> 00:37:00.000]   ah maybe that's it avatar hookers well that's how many you guys how many you guys do the the
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.560]   second life thing that really oh you do the world of uh i have a second life avatar and i've spent
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:08.960]   time in second life in fact there was i think he sold it but there was a twit amphitheater and
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:13.120]   the daily gizwiz warehouse and stuff but uh the gadget but you other guys are you other guys
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:18.640]   doing second life i have seen the greatest minds of my generation destroyed by second life avatars
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:24.800]   i like world of work crafts i just i tried it because i figured like it's like i don't know
[00:37:24.800 --> 00:37:29.680]   drugs maybe you gotta try it no your friends do your second life care and cool i have the
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:33.760]   set up i have this thing on my house is called a door to the outside i'm really into that
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:38.400]   isn't it funny because you know we sound like we're a bunch of old you know funny duddies but i
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:42.400]   really think that second life is highly overhyped i don't think it's interesting at all
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:49.200]   why why do we sound like funny duddies i mean and not go says he goes outside i was outside today
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:56.560]   people you say you kids get out of my virtual law because fennox delivered a new server that
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:38:01.920]   wouldn't bring into the house so i put on the white wire suit it burns it burns it brave brave
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:07.680]   the giant day ball i had to use my egress affordance device in order to get out to the
[00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:12.000]   yard to collect by things from the fennox thought to myself my god that's a high ceiling this
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.440]   room must cost a fortune to eat those bushes look so real
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:23.360]   where's the point i was at the failure i was at in the i was at in the fog yesterday it was very
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:28.160]   foggy right here and i was like driving around and i was like who turned down the draw distance oh jeez
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:35.280]   that is a bad sign that's a really bad sign no the the the worst thing is when i i i started
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:38.960]   downloading some salsa music because it was on a podcast and i was forced to do this
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:43.680]   and unfortunately this tapped into a long buried memory from college wait a minute you run a podcast
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:48.240]   that forced you to download salsa music because it was just so damn catchy you haven't heard that
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:54.400]   leo salsa at gunpoint it's right one of the most popular shows you must down no door die hey
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:59.760]   well the thing is i found myself speeding on the highway and i couldn't remember why but it turned
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:03.840]   out i remember because i used to play outrun during college and there was the salsa music on that
[00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:08.000]   soundtrack and every time i was seeing a highway overpass it's like i saw the word checkpoint
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:15.840]   painted on it i had a rush to make it to make an extra game wow wow wow hey i'm doing 85 miles
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:21.040]   an hour in a 50 mile an hour zone i'd like to hear you explain that to the highway patrolman when
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:25.920]   he pays you over so when we're since we're on the subject of drugs yeah sounds like it doesn't
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:30.880]   have you seen this thing you know the future of work thing is this is like a yeah this is showing
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:36.720]   up all of this the stories about there's this one particular drug and uh that's used for narcolepsy
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:40.400]   that apparently make you know is there's a brain enhancing tool it makes you
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:46.160]   uh focus better you stay awake longer with uh higher energy and you can learn faster
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:51.040]   and i was actually did little research on this and they they've there's a there's a whole family of
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:56.160]   these these crazy drugs and they've been and the one thing i did learn is that they found some old
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:40:01.920]   they tested them on old beagles okay and it turned and they turned out you know some old dogs it turned
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:08.240]   out you could you can teach old dogs new tricks we walked all the way down that road i mean i
[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:13.200]   have documentation for this it's not you know this is sounds like a shaggy dog yeah this sounds like
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:19.520]   this is made for us leo it is it's from the article i saw was a popular science and uh these are as
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:24.720]   you said these are drugs for narcolepsy and the u.s. food and drug administration has as approved
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:32.960]   them pro vigil is one uh air force pilots use it uh college students cramming for exams another one is
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:39.360]   a modef a modofenil a modofenil which is the same idea a modofenil
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:44.880]   they these are called uh ugeroics are ugeroics is that any say i don't know what they're worth
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:50.640]   they don't simply jazz up the whole body they tweak sleep specific mechanisms in the brain so
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:56.720]   you don't feel jittery or wired just wide awake cognitive enhancer i like the sound of that every
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:59.920]   time i see something like this it sounds like oh yeah this they're gonna find out i cause this
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:04.000]   cancer in about a week right i mean but it has been out for a while these this that does not
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.440]   new it just recently discovered that it could be used for other things some people have been on
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:11.520]   these things for a long time because people do actually do have narcolepsy right and so they
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:16.080]   haven't found any connection like that but i did little research on the two things i found out
[00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:20.720]   there is there's a i don't remember the name but there's a drug that came out some years ago
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:25.680]   that was produced by a french company that actually i had similar effects except for the
[00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:31.920]   fact that it had that it would give you an orgasm uh after about an hour just out of the blue
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:37.040]   not nothing i guess but the fd8 in like it because it takes consider to like uh you know
[00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:41.120]   control it bad ever biff half people are right the bus every day that would sell
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:46.960]   so i thought that was a warning label on that caution and then the other one is that
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:50.720]   it's cool intense pleasure if anybody thinks they're going to get a prescription for these
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:55.680]   things and go off and uh you know take them as needed they're about uh they're about eight to
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:42:00.960]   ten dollars a pill and how long is the pill last you need like two or three a day i think
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:05.920]   six like that or wait a little early book so it's like it's like nine hundred dollars a month if you
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:11.520]   use this stuff well john do you remember what happens in adiocracy uh all the one of the problems
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:16.640]   that they end up with is they end up spending all of the uh medical research on um on on
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:23.280]   male ed problems and uh hair loss right yeah the future where it is where it's just so you know
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:26.960]   the visual of the monkey that they're testing both of those on is worth the price of the rent all
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:31.200]   though it's now you got everybody out there has to rent this movie if you had to do movies but you
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:36.320]   have to watch both of you but you should probably see mike judges office space first you should
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:40.000]   definitely rent that if you've never seen that if you enjoy it office space i think you'll definitely
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.320]   uh it's a stunning movie in every way in terms of if you of course if you've never been in an
[00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:48.480]   officer cowboy or something maybe it won't make any sense the production design also is incredible
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:53.040]   i mean just the the amount of care that's going into recreating all the adiocracy yeah i'll find
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:57.040]   i'll find a link for this there's a good there was a there the one scene i like doing looks over the
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:01.840]   city and there's this city that is just falling apart and they have these like a twin towers
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:04.800]   that are kind of strapped together because they're together with stroller
[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:10.800]   and like they look so hilarious and like on the hospital the st god memorial hospital the
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:14.240]   other letters are falling off the side because they didn't account for how much space it would take up
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:20.880]   there's a lot of humor in that movie so anyways we want to see office space then you want to see
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:25.360]   idiocracy another reason to hate fox i think we're just gonna wrap it up right here because i think
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:30.320]   that's all we need to say uh in fact most most of the audience has already gone off to rent the
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:37.440]   movie so it's hope it's just it's just the four of us frankly uh john c de vorac is at de vorac.org/blog
