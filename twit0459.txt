[00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.680]   Street. It's nice to see you Brian. Dude I'm so thrilled that that I am your
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:27.400]   last ditch date for this video. Thank you for calling me last. Don't people don't
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.880]   tell don't tell food. Anyway it's nice to have you on Brian as a professional
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:40.280]   magician. You can book him at what is it? Shwood.com. Shwood.com yeah yeah he also
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.600]   sells scam stuff online. This is the it's kind of nice one of the few online
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.260]   stores where they actually admit that the stuff they're selling is a scam. Oh my
[00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.380]   god dude dude real quick. Normally this is at the end of the show real quick. We
[00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.260]   have a hat that will put a man in the hospital. If you go to scamsdub.com it's
[00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.500]   called the Robes revenge. It is a hat with buckshot sewn into the back so that
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.820]   if you get attacked you whip off your hat you'd grab the bill like a handle and
[00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:17.480]   you beat the crap out of the guy. It's a door. It's a plus one defense two times
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.900]   attack multiplier. It has it has that's amazing so it's basically a weapon.
[00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.880]   Sure I mean legally I don't think I should. Did you design this? Did you make
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.580]   this yourself or was this something you found and you decided to sell to your
[00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.780]   friends. We partnered with a company called Schomer Tech that makes a self
[00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.060]   defense stuff and it and what we did was we took their existing product and we
[00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:51.220]   added buckshot. I don't know some some yeah we weaponize their stuff. It has of
[00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.020]   course the brush with logo on it. Brian. Let's talk about the tech news. We're
[00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.860]   gonna get to that. I haven't even introduced I haven't even introduced the
[00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.460]   rest of the team here but it's good to have you once again Brian and thank you

[00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.980]   development but let me introduce also our third panel member and of course the
[00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:18.220]   great Larry Maggot of CBS radio regular on the Twits great to have you Larry
[00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:22.140]   it's always fun to be here yeah we like having you on the show you know just
[00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:26.920]   came in from Paris last night so if I seem if I start dozing off a little jet
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:31.220]   lag gosh we have world travelers Larry's in Silicon Valley but fresh off Paris
[00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:36.580]   Ben is in Taiwan and Brian brushwood is in the people's Republic of Austin
[00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.820]   Austin I'm gonna be there next month yeah you should hang out nice town
[00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:47.380]   yeah I love Austin dude Austin is is it's amazing to watch how similar Austin's
[00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:52.540]   explosion has been to to the Bay Area you know to San Francisco and so on yeah
[00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:58.420]   in your dreams fresh wood in your dreams so this week Microsoft announced
[00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:05.860]   surface pro 3 the third surface in 18 months and while the reviews have been
[00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.100]   mostly positive I think the only negative thing I saw was that battery life was
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:14.260]   a little bit disappointing it's thinner it's faster it's running the current
[00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:21.500]   high-end Intel fourth generation core processors it is pricey and Microsoft
[00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:25.740]   pretty much admitted we're gonna just we don't want to you know eat the low-end
[00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:30.740]   we want to keep a vital ecosystem of OEMs so we're gonna go at the high-end we
[00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:37.460]   are aiming to be exactly the same as a comparable Apple Macintosh laptop all
[00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:41.180]   right first of all I actually think this is a smart decision for them to make
[00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:45.140]   but understand like like I'm on the outside of this I haven't read all this
[00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:49.500]   stuff so so you could tell me like they're definitely not trying to compete with
[00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:53.980]   the iPad market because the first generation of surface very much looked
[00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:59.300]   like hey man it's an iPad with a keyboard whereas this sounds from what I've
[00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:02.660]   heard so far like they're definitely trying to compete with the laptop
[00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:07.220]   market instead yeah yeah yeah what well they all they always had optional
[00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:10.860]   keyboards but this one's got what do they call it the friction keyboard so you
[00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:14.900]   can actually hold it in your lap and the and the and the it's very much like the
[00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:18.940]   original type keyboard but it has a few little extra but but the other thing
[00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:22.180]   about the keyboard I haven't tested the new one but all of the type keyboards
[00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:26.460]   they've had are still a little smaller than your in your standard keyboard so
[00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:30.860]   for those of us who touch really type very fast it's a little bit of a problem
[00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:35.020]   having a slightly smaller keyboard I would I that's why I use a little bigger
[00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:39.940]   and the and the track pads bigger to Ben you think bigger have you played with
[00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:45.060]   it Ben or no no I have it yeah I have an original but not not the third one
[00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:50.260]   yeah I think it it all depends on the context that you look at it with I mean
[00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:56.780]   it compared to the other surfaces I think it's a good product I think there
[00:08:56.780 --> 00:09:01.980]   is a niche that is interested in this in this sort of product I think the the
[00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:05.500]   bigger picture is looking at the program as a whole as compared to looking at one
[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:09.460]   any individual products the challenge you wrote the article the day after the
[00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:17.020]   announcement it's time to kill surface in your words the the problem Microsoft
[00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:20.300]   has is that this is the surface is their first hardware they've never made
[00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:26.260]   PCs they changed that long-term strategy a year and a half ago
[00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:32.340]   risking their relationships with all the other windows hardware manufacturers
[00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:37.380]   plus you know kind of muddying the waters and they said well we want to make a
[00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:44.340]   machine that is as good as windows can be I do feel like I kind of agree with you
[00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:49.460]   Brian that they kind of are are less focused on the on the tablet these days
[00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:52.660]   and really you're kind of making a laptop computer almost with a with a
[00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:56.940]   minimally removal keyboard why do you think Ben it's time to kill the surface
[00:09:56.940 --> 00:10:01.460]   though what what's the issue well I think you just kind of articulated it is is
[00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:09.740]   I feel like the again if you look at it in a vacuum the move to focus on it being
[00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:14.820]   more of a laptop a laptop with tablet features makes a lot of sense it's a
[00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:20.580]   much more I think coherent product now than it than it was before the problem
[00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:27.780]   is is is in the process of having a new product and a new goal and a new niche
[00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:33.420]   you're by definition for getting the original goals of the entire program and
[00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:39.940]   and it happens to be that the new product and the new goals actually defeat the
[00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:42.820]   original purposes of the product in the first place I think it's a classic
[00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:47.060]   example of your kind of sunk cost you're thinking about well how do we make this
[00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:50.820]   better and you forget why do we even have this in the first place if you step
[00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:54.260]   back and look at why do we even have it in the first place then you realize
[00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:59.620]   maybe we're actually already pretty far down the wrong path and we're
[00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:03.060]   continuing to go down it maybe it's best to step back and reconsider the whole
[00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:08.820]   thing your surface made sense when windows 8 first came out I think it was
[00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:12.940]   there was definite arguments on both sides when it came out but there was
[00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:16.700]   definitely a case be made both from a product and a business sort of standpoint
[00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:23.980]   now like I don't I think that case is gone and it's existing because surface
[00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:27.940]   exists and so if you look at like oh we're making surface how do we make it
[00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:32.500]   better then it's a great product I think it improves in a lot of ways but if
[00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:38.140]   you look at it as why do we have the surface program at all then that's
[00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:43.140]   where I have the problems with it the key question is is do we really want a
[00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:47.300]   laptop that can convert into a tablet which in a sense is what it is right it's
[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:51.020]   not a particularly viable tablet if if you're going out and you wanted a
[00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:55.180]   tablet you wanted occasionally type I'm not sure that's what you'd get and if
[00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:59.380]   you wanted the laptop that you would use as a laptop wouldn't you be better off
[00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:03.660]   with a MacBook Air or one of the good a-sirs or the many excellent small
[00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:07.860]   laptops that are in the market I mean my Mac Air sure it's a little heavier but
[00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:13.020]   not significantly heavier than what what they're offering and it's it's I think
[00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:18.500]   a better laptop now it's not a tablet but yeah why so so that's exactly the
[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:24.180]   point though it's like yeah if you go back to kind of first principles the
[00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:28.580]   very premise of Windows 8 and the way I frame it is surface is the physical
[00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:33.540]   manifestation of Windows 8 like the very premise is that people want a one
[00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:38.540]   device that does both and I think that premise is flawed yeah it was what was
[00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:44.180]   wrong with Windows 8 was it was this hodgepodge of touch and desktop you know
[00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:50.300]   personally yeah I just seem travel with a small laptop and a seven inch tablet so
[00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:54.260]   I've got both and and I use them in different different situations you know
[00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:58.180]   I'm and I'm sure Brian and we'll have something to say about this but I think
[00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:01.660]   the tablets dead I think that people are choosing either to bring a mobile
[00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:07.020]   device a phone with them or a laptop and nobody needs this thing in the middle
[00:13:07.020 --> 00:13:13.700]   anymore and I had sales only you're you are a hundred percent right in that
[00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:18.320]   the worst place to get into is the mushy middle the mushy middle between two
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:22.540]   different objects is not a good place to launch a product because the natural
[00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:28.020]   order of brands and for things is to diverge constantly right so in that
[00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:31.700]   regard try this on for size right now keep in mind I haven't seen this device
[00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:36.820]   I don't know what it looks like or whatever let me hype hypothesize about
[00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:40.700]   why this might be a good place should you have to see it to talk about it I
[00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:45.740]   think go right ahead okay thank you don't need to know anything about it
[00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:49.780]   just say welcome to this weekend
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:56.500]   here's what hypothetically might be smart about this is the way surface 1.0
[00:13:56.500 --> 00:14:04.460]   was launched was here's another tablet that has an attachable keyboard the way
[00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:10.400]   they're launching surface 3.0 is here's a laptop with a detachable key
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:14.180]   right right and that might be really smart right because it's like it's like
[00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:19.540]   if it's a different but it is I think closer to what the markets looking for
[00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:23.380]   frankly well and plus also I suspect that they are identifying a segment of
[00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:28.100]   the market that is underserved like nobody who edits photos nobody who is
[00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:32.960]   editing videos is using their iPad to do it right it's a they're using their
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:36.440]   laptop if they're going to use any kind of mobile device whatsoever so if you
[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:42.620]   have what ostensibly is one of those content creation devices instead of a
[00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:47.980]   content consumption device and you know what you know whatever you just
[00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:51.460]   frame the existence of a keyboard slightly differently I think that might
[00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:55.180]   be a really smart playing on Microsoft Spark yeah remember the first surface
[00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:59.380]   lost Microsoft 900 million dollars they took in almost a billion dollars
[00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:06.420]   less than the Xbox lost Microsoft Microsoft lost on Xbox they lost
[00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:10.200]   a billion dollars yeah which turned out to be a great thing when they had the
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:13.680]   next two iterations right well it makes you feel better I basically indirectly
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:18.520]   send the articulation kill Xbox too but I think the most of the drum beat is
[00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:22.380]   spin-off Xbox right Steve Enlop and others have said let's just spin this
[00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:27.480]   thing off I think I think Brian's right though and that's what I mean by if you
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:33.240]   look at the product in isolation I think it's a good product they they're I
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:39.480]   believe there is a niche that prefers or I'm there has to be a niche that
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:45.320]   prefers this sort of combination right on the problem though is by making it
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:50.000]   the product it ought to be you're destroying the business case for the
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.800]   entire program and that's what I get by saying Microsoft ought to kill it it's
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:57.760]   not that it's a bad product and it's not that they they're not doing the right
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:01.840]   thing in isolation it's that by doing the right thing in isolation they are
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:05.560]   losing the story in the very big picture about why the entire thing
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:09.600]   exists I'm winning that way because there are so many times where there's
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:13.720]   been the right product in a genuinely good product but they didn't have the
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:16.840]   right story to back it and I like the fact that you're framing it as a
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:20.600]   story-based decision of all companies you think Microsoft would understand its
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:24.560]   business better than anybody else but I think part of this is a misunderstanding
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:29.680]   of why people buy Windows well that's part of it and it's also I'm not sure
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:33.320]   that's true that's why I actually used Xbox in the article itself because I
[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:37.720]   think Xbox is I used Xbox to illustrate it's I think it's actually easier to
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:43.360]   understand you know Xbox the reason the an Xbox exists in the first place is
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:46.440]   that Microsoft wanted to own the living room right and only in the living room
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:51.840]   means everyone has an Xbox not just gamers but Xbox now was only you know
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:55.120]   you saw them cutting the connect last week was kind of the last the last bit
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:58.880]   about reaching out to everyone as an entertainment system it's now just about
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:03.400]   gamers like they've lost the plot right in the big picture and that's the same
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:09.920]   thing that's happening with surface in my opinion I also feel like you actually
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.600]   like in the surface I think this is pretty apt to the HTC one a gorgeous
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:18.440]   device beautifully made but but aimed at a market that barely exists that is a
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:23.960]   niche a tiny niche market high-end hardware whereas people buy Windows
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:27.200]   either because it's really cheap and I'll tell you what I hear this all the time
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:32.640]   on the radio show I need a $300 computer yeah or they're in business and they
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:37.440]   use Windows as a power tool as a truck to do spreadsheets and they're buying
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:42.520]   desktop Dell's keep it on also the others a there's a third element where I
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.120]   believe that there's a significant number of people who are buying it
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:49.200]   because it's familiar like quite simply it this is what I know how to do but if
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:52.320]   they're not having time or energy to put into yeah then they get one and they
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:55.600]   don't know how to use it it would have been familiar if they know no no a
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.200]   fence band but if they hadn't come out with Windows 8 it would have been
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:02.080]   familiar but they've changed the user face the interface to the point where
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:06.440]   it's not familiar to most people anymore so if you're gonna invest in a in a
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:09.760]   Windows 8 touchscreen you've got to learn the Metro interface I realize it's
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:15.680]   that brain surgery but you are you are changing the paradigm a bit and I think
[00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:19.400]   that's a problem as well because it's not your father's windows and your
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:23.520]   father's windows actually works I mean I have no problems with Windows 7 it
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:28.080]   works great in the desktop it works great on laptops and no offense taken I
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:31.680]   I completely agree just because you worked on it doesn't mean you just because
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:34.960]   of your fault it's your fault
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:39.840]   had I made had I made every decision that that was important to Windows 8
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:43.400]   then you take the blame yeah well you know it's my Christmas I would be
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:46.720]   free there won't be a membership program on both lines I would I would be
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:51.520]   a self-sufficient financial the irony is the irony is Microsoft gives you a
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:55.520]   laptop you know with a removal I'm sorry a laptop with a removal keyboard or a
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:58.400]   tablet with an attachable keyboard everyone to look at and then they give
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:02.960]   you Windows 8 and they essentially force you into an interface a I mean yes
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:06.360]   there are ways to get around it and go back to the Windows 7 interface but they
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:11.120]   made it really hard and so where they could have easily created an operating
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:15.040]   system that would have been actually all things to all people in the Windows
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:18.640]   world they didn't but then they tried to create hardware that's all things to
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:23.040]   all people which is kind of ironic I mean the tough thing Larry is that that we've
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:28.000]   seen examples of you know for example with what you know Apple made some
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.560]   extraordinarily bold decisions with the way they created your iOS ecosystem
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:37.280]   where they said yes yes everyone says they want this everyone's wrong and then
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:43.360]   they went forward I don't know that I want to pull that tool out of Microsoft's
[00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:47.800]   hands just because they may not have hit the mark quite the way that Apple did
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:56.000]   you know well they love that iOS iOS was a new product it was a new category I
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.840]   think you know the issue with with Windows is it was it's a known category
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:06.160]   it's a very large category right and you know the if there is an analogy on
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:11.880]   the Apple side it's it's something like iOS 7 but even then like from an actual
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:16.840]   like the way you use it standpoint it was a very very small change nothing
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:21.920]   comparable to what Windows 8 kind of inflicted on the on the Windows
[00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:25.320]   user base and it's interesting this is actually a really good point you make
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:30.480]   Ben because the natural state of things is to constantly diverge and I've talked
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:34.320]   about this before but it's like you know as as origin of the species said you
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:39.120]   know there wasn't a morphing or coming together of monkeys that turned into a
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:43.480]   man instead there was this constant divergence and all these you know some
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:48.240]   thrives some died but but eventually you had this thread that led from you
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:53.320]   know from from a chimpanzee to a human or whatever and likewise I wonder if the
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:57.240]   mistake here for Microsoft is not so much that they're trying to enter the
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:03.360]   space but the mistake is that they're using the the Windows name with it right
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:08.080]   I mean it could could it could be that simply this is a branding problem a
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:12.520]   chat well that was that was the whole you know go ahead so I mean what you've
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:17.000]   got here is what do they call law nobody uses them act that way what are you doing
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.480]   I know I had to go out I actually had to search run I actually forgot how to
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:25.480]   bring it up because I don't even I did it's the point is the iOS interface on a
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:28.600]   desktop yeah but the point is they made it really optional it's kind of it's
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:32.400]   almost hidden I mean it's there right if you really want it you can have it but
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:36.640]   they didn't force it down your throats and and that's I like that I mean if
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:40.240]   they want to put it there fine I don't I never use it I literally had to kind of
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:46.000]   hunt around for the icon but the fact is Microsoft essentially shoves Metro
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.360]   dying your throat and Apple just kind of put it off in the side you know who
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:53.600]   loves hope for people would use it who loves the surface pro 3 the creator of
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:59.360]   penny arcade this is the niche market as CW Gabriel Gabe says it does everything
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:03.200]   right it's light I love the kickstand it's just what I've been craving of course
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:07.920]   he's drawing a cartoon on this thing the pen yeah is great I have to say this if
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:13.160]   you know who the market is if you use one note this is the ideal one note
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:17.880]   device was made to use one oh you click the pen the computer comes on and launches
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:23.640]   one note you can write into it it's I mean it is like a smart tablet but I I
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:27.440]   have to say it doesn't feel like something that I could recommend to
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:30.600]   people if they're in the market for Windows I'm gonna send them to an acer
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:35.040]   I'm gonna send them to a Lenovo it's I just it's hard for me especially at the
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:39.840]   price now it starts at 800 bucks for an i3 based if you get the top the line it's
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:43.880]   two thousand dollars Wow and then you have to add a hundred twenty nine dollar
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:48.960]   keyboard the keyboard doesn't come with it so I mean do you do you think this is
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.520]   the kind of thing where it's like they almost would have benefited if they had
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:55.040]   made the price and forgiving I'm sure a bunch of people will be angry that I'm
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:57.840]   even saying this but but is this the kind of thing where they could have
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:03.680]   enjoyed a better market position if they had made the price even higher like
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:09.200]   like understand like like the higher I make your price the more exclusive I
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:13.560]   mean it worked for Apple yeah I mean Apple definitely but they are an Apple
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:17.360]   pricing no but they are now an Apple pricing their Apple price well that's
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:20.600]   the point with the key more actually more than more than Apple price are you
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:25.080]   saying they should go more than Apple pricing well I think yes I think they
[00:23:25.080 --> 00:23:30.160]   should I think they should do they make it out of solid gold the problem is when
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:34.320]   you match Apple's pricing and you match Apple's margins you lose all you're doing
[00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:38.520]   is saying lose we are a pale imitation of Apple that's what they need to do if
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:42.600]   they want to set themselves apart is they should figure out something a little
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:46.760]   bit extra that you know whatever effort it takes or whatever license it requires
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:52.960]   them to buy and instead you know take that and and set themselves apart if you
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:57.840]   want to make the credible claim that you're better than Apple it seems to me
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:01.600]   maybe you should charge more than Apple and that's what they have to be better
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:05.840]   than Apple not to charge no you know you know you don't know Larry Ben agrees
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:11.680]   Ben you agree well I think for for Gabe Newell the server now better than Apple
[00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:15.240]   what I'm not Gabe Newell sorry oh I see that you Gabriel the
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:19.840]   you're sorry yeah yeah I don't know how good Newell feels about this but I'm
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:23.840]   thinking he's going Linux I don't think he's he's a big fan of the windows 8 as I
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.840]   remember
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:35.520]   Gabe Newell loves the surface pro 3 yeah I worked I worked in the so I worked on
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:40.440]   the team that that was getting out for the App Store and we were very familiar
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:45.000]   with gave Nules position on Windows 8 is very negative as I remember yeah so no
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.600]   but I think for if you're CW Gabriel the surface is better than Windows 8 that's
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:54.120]   that's and that's what's good about the current product is wait a minute it's
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:25:00.680]   better than Windows 8 it's better than Mac okay yeah I had or a Mac book yeah
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:04.280]   the problem though is that how many people like CW Gabriel right and when
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:08.040]   you get to that point the kind of the whole economics of why the program
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:12.000]   exists you know kind of falls apart I mean the problem is windows it actually
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   goes back to your tablet point Windows was petrified Microsoft was petrified
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:25.880]   of what the iPad seemed to be doing to computers and and you know felt that
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:29.880]   this entire thing is going away sooner or later and I think what Windows 8 was
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:34.000]   was really a an attempt to pull the pull everything forward I agree you're gonna
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.240]   we're gonna double down now agree if if you think about it if Windows had been
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:42.840]   successful if they had been able to successfully frame Windows 8 as being a
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:47.120]   tablet alternative but you get everything all at once we would be sitting here
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:52.560]   seeing like the one of the greatest business decisions ever and the problem
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:58.040]   is you know anything with huge upside like Windows 8 had by definition as huge
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:01.800]   downside I mean that's that's the idea of taking the huge I love I guess in the
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:05.200]   pre-show that's that's exactly what it is yeah I think I think Ben nailed it
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:10.120]   right it's like if what you want to do is position yourself as a game changer
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:14.600]   you can't do that if you're the company that is also the establishment
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:19.480]   right Microsoft is the establishment which meant that the market was wide open for
[00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:23.520]   Apple to be the game changer to me it feels like Microsoft and also be the
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:28.920]   game it feels like Microsoft is the dog that just woke up and it sees Apple and
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:33.040]   it's like it's tail and it starts to chase its tail and then it starts going
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:37.480]   in a circle because it can't catch up in fact what's happened is it chased Apple
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:40.800]   but the lay of the land suddenly changed even Apple had the rug out pulled out
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:47.320]   from under it on tablets I think you cannot chase you have to lead if you're
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:52.440]   gonna be in this marketplace I think big picture to me I almost felt bad
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:55.480]   writing this article because I've written as you might expect a fair bit
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:59.680]   of Microsoft it's certainly been a very newsworthy year and the reality is I
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:04.720]   think the company broadly is doing really great stuff right now particularly when
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:10.200]   it comes to their cloud their cloud as future yeah and in the way they're
[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:16.560]   they're treating iOS Android to some extent especially iOS as a first as a
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:20.680]   first-class platform where they're developing directly on it now so they're
[00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:25.120]   doing lots of great stuff and I feel like the entire Surface program is a bit of
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:31.480]   a vestige of the of the previous administration that they they have all
[00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:34.320]   this capability of hire all these people they have all these plants and stuff
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:38.720]   like that and it's I'm worried it's slipping into it's continuing to exist
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:43.760]   because it exists and it doesn't really fit with the really great work that the
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:47.040]   rest of the company is doing in the way the companies really shifted direction
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:51.720]   in other places and and this whole conversation this you know Microsoft had
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:55.800]   a great run of two to three months of everyone being really positive on where
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:59.120]   they're going and the point the fact we spent 20 minutes talking about what
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:03.480]   they're doing wrong I think is is kind of emblematic of what what makes the
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:08.320]   whole thing unfortunate welcome to Microsoft's world Satya Nadella's been
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:12.000]   trying to change things I think this could be something he inherited and is
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.840]   not I mean he clearly understands enterprise in the cloud that's where he
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:18.160]   came from in vital counts he killed the surface many that's this is what I was
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:22.360]   just about to bring up so they all all rumors in Paul and Mary Joe Foley Paul
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:26.040]   throughout Mary Joe Foley on our Windows weekly show said our sources were very
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:30.960]   clear there was a there was a mini there was a was a eight inch surface
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:35.440]   running Windows RT they were gonna announce it in fact this event if you
[00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:39.760]   look at the invite for the event it mentioned what us a little thing or
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:44.440]   something like that and it was very clear that this was gonna be a surface
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:49.960]   mini event and that something happened and so it's your opinion that Satya
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:53.320]   looked at it said we're not gonna release it now or not gonna release it
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:57.960]   ever yeah well I mean the specifics are unclear apparently some combination of
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:02.440]   Nadella and and Eli up yes even Eli I'm involved because he's the devices guy
[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:10.120]   yeah the the question is is it delayed or is it is it killed my unders it's
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:17.080]   unclear but it was it was definitely I suspect it's killed is it does that mean
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:22.560]   RT is killed right I think that's that's probably part of it like we want to
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:26.920]   continue as opposed to I mean the long-term goal is to unify Windows phone in
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:31.600]   RT yeah the fact that they kind of launched as separate as a whole another
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:37.640]   that's another you know 2000 words I could write very easily but I suspect
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:42.320]   they're waiting for that unification to be done before they watch anything the
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:46.720]   space if at all and right now you have the like the 1520 by Lumia which is
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:50.640]   already like seven inches so there there are it's beautiful I love it yeah
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:53.920]   almost there as it is yeah and in fact so so that's that's the phone that
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:59.160]   convinced me that there's no point in having a tablet no I mean of course
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:03.880]   there's rumors that you know that that iOS is gonna have a a you know I don't
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:08.120]   know what are they called tablets whatever that's I think that's a bogus
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:12.200]   rumor but but we'll see what about things like our note we are reading
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:17.040]   watching movies Leo I mean I mean to me for my tablet is basically a consumption
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:21.880]   machine reading watching movies I tend to do it on either a Mac an iPad mini or a
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:27.760]   seven inch Google tablet I mean you know I but I wouldn't spend a fortune for
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:32.920]   one I do you how important is it that you have that size device are you gonna go
[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:37.880]   buy one just well I think Amazon smart by pricing them in about it look just over
[00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:41.040]   a hundred bucks the what does a Kindle fire started about a hundred and thirty
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:45.320]   yeah but if I'm gonna read books I would rather have a Kindle paper white if I'm
[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:49.080]   gonna watch movies I can watch it on my phone if we hold the phone my ten year
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:54.080]   old is deeply deeply in love with her paper white it is true magic terror like
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:58.720]   like a much better reading experience than any tablet agreed agreed yeah well
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:02.720]   this is but you're kind of getting at the whole windows 8 problem I think is
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:10.880]   windows 8 supposes that everyone's top priority is is carrying as few devices
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:14.400]   as possible and the problem is that's true when it comes to a phone right we
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:19.040]   only have a few pockets when it comes to actual like if we have the luxury of
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:22.320]   using multiple devices well it's it's often best to use the best device for
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:26.920]   the job and if if your top priority is not having one device it's having the
[00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:32.200]   best device then the whole windows 8 premise falls apart and that's I think
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:35.360]   I think you're a hundred percent right Ben I think that that that what you're
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:39.360]   describing is like the number one most pervasive myth in anybody in the
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:45.240]   marketing world outside of the clock radio there's been virtually no devices
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:49.880]   and then think about this the outside the clock radio there's been no devices
[00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:56.360]   where combining crap has worked out like the the only time that you have devices
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:00.400]   that happen to combine things that they've worked is when they define a brand new
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:04.280]   category completely for themselves and that's what we saw with the iPhone the
[00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:08.840]   iPhone was not even though they pitched it as it's an iPhone it's a communications
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:15.920]   device it's the best you know iPod we've ever done that was the ostensible claim
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:19.680]   but in fact what they did was they created a brand new category of device
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:23.640]   and they own that category it's divergence you want to see divergence not
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:29.040]   convergence and what we've seen so far from Microsoft has been convergence and
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:31.840]   I think that's a mistake on their part well we're gonna break we're gonna break
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:35.440]   radio there's a synergy between a clock and a radio I mean a clock radio makes
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:38.880]   sense because it wakes you up with music and so it's not as if it's usually a
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:42.560]   lot of great anymore well now you use your phone to make you a
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:47.000]   idea anybody have a clock radio well from the chat I have to give credit
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   the people are pointing out that also the sport the sport is the other convergence
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:57.720]   it's the constraint right like the reason why the phone there's that great
[00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:00.240]   picture floating around where there's like ten items and then it shows one
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:04.920]   iPhone but that's because there is a constraint of a pocket and when I'm
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:09.360]   walking around it has to fit in there but if I'm carrying a laptop by definition
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:15.520]   I at least have a bag and now that constraint is much looser and it's much
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:19.720]   easier to carry two things I like having a phone and a laptop I think that's it I
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:23.720]   don't know necessarily carry that laptop with me I think you need a computer I
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:26.840]   think you need a phone I don't think there's anything much in between except
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:31.040]   a clock radio which apparently every single person in the chat room still has
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:37.480]   it's fine I'm shocked I thought that was like you know clock radio really I'm
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:41.320]   right next to my VCR yeah it's I mean think about how many things that that
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:45.480]   then people tried to invent by combining those two things together and think
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:49.080]   about how ridiculous that's been in the long run you know it's like the camel is
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:54.000]   a horse designed by a committee right and I will end that conversation on that
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.800]   now we're gonna come back and talk there's lots more and then I'm really glad
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:01.720]   that you're here with us today Ben Thompson from Stretakari all the way from
[00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:05.760]   Taiwan where it is very early morning but we made him get up early because it's
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:10.280]   still in the now so it's getting later it's cool still and of course he has the
[00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:16.800]   best Skype connection of anybody here of course just want to point that out if
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:20.680]   you want to talk about yeah broad you know the best thing about being in Europe
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:23.640]   last week is that at the best phone service that I've had in a long time
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:28.160]   because I was outside the United States my phone actually worked yeah nine
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:31.600]   hundred I have a hundred megabytes down and I pay a shot $30 a month
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:35.760]   shut up we will talk about that neutrality we had a big conversation last
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:39.520]   time Brian brush was on about three or four weeks ago is it all are we all
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:44.360]   measuring our winners right here I've got 300 megabits down he's got
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:50.080]   fiber now this poor this guy that's fiber AT&T AT&T preemptively striking
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:55.760]   back against Google you have gigabit no no well well what AT&T did is like a
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:35:00.320]   Google announced they were coming to Austin right and technically we're outside
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:05.080]   of the Austin city limits and so I thought I was screwed but preemptively
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:10.360]   AT&T is it well will show you will offer our giga I don't know they have some
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:15.080]   stupid name for it but basically it's it's 300 gigabits or 300 megabits
[00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:19.840]   net down now and then over the summer they allegedly will upgrade us to
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:24.200]   gigabytes fiber though right it's not is it fiber fiber fiber to the current
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:29.880]   and what do they charge for that there's two versions of it they have they
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:34.920]   claim what they what they promote is it's only seven dollars or $70 a month if
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:39.280]   you do internet preferences however when you look into what internet
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:42.760]   preferences I'm doing air quotes for the audio listeners that mean internet
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:50.160]   preferences is oh oh yeah BT dubs we're going to track all of your traffic oh
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:55.120]   see every set website you go to and serve you tailored ads to you it's ads
[00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:59.560]   subsidized basically you'll save you'll save $29 a month so I was like no
[00:35:59.560 --> 00:36:03.400]   that tells you how much those targeted ads are worth if you're if there were
[00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:08.720]   30 bucks it must be more really to AT&T that's amazing a month certainly so
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:11.800]   take a break come back with more we got a great panel Brian brush rot is here
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:17.680]   also Larry Maggot from CBS and safer kids.org and now I'm going to tell you
[00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:21.920]   about something I don't know anything about ladies and gentlemen project
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:26.520]   tracking with Atlassian Jira I saw the Godzilla movie last week does that help
[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:33.400]   go Jira Jira is named after Godzilla it is a tracker for teams who are
[00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:38.360]   building great products it's more we're not just talking like a github here this
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:42.040]   is everything you need of course it works with Git beautifully but you can
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:46.160]   follow your code from all the way from the very beginning in the planning
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:51.120]   document stage all the way to delivery in one system and for people who are
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:55.520]   managing big teams and big projects and and you see this some of the some of
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:37:00.240]   the biggest companies in the world use Jira 70% of the fortune 100 70 out of a
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:05.920]   hundred use Jira NASA uses Jira and they'd have some of the biggest projects of
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:10.600]   all 25,000 companies in total it's flexible and simple enough for a five
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:14.160]   person startup powerful and reliable enough for a hundred thousand person
[00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:20.320]   enterprise that is amazing so this is this is Leo like I assume and I hope
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:24.440]   you can explain it to me like basically you you got a project you got a few
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:30.120]   people working on it and and similar to what Google Docs innovated yeah that
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:34.320]   everybody touches it and it changes real time for everyone right well I'm
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:36.960]   better than that because there are already this is so widely used there are
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:41.680]   thousands of Jira add-ons you can do test management time tracking project
[00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:45.280]   management I mean there's literally you go in there and you'll just see all of
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:50.800]   the different ads ons because this is so popular it works as I said with Git it
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:54.360]   works with Google Docs if you want to use Google Docs I want you to visit
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:59.800]   Atlassian.com/twit for more information on Jira very affordable plans started
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:05.280]   $10 a month for up to 10 users this is what Pied Piper should be using on Silicon
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:09.360]   Valley they are you look I'm sure it's I'm sure this is amazing but I'm not made
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:14.800]   of money sir I want to know if this is good before I'm hysterical try it free
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:18.480]   for 30 days you don't need this Brian you don't need it I don't need it and
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:22.640]   half the audience is leaving thank you for joining us every time I talk about
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:32.160]   this their at lassian Jira so so dive in dive in for 30 days freeze free you know
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:36.000]   what if you're a potential customer for this you know what it is you know what
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.880]   you would do with it you've probably already looked at it and I'm just
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:43.080]   encouraging to give it a try because there is really no better way to do this
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:48.880]   it's Atlassian's J.A. J.I.R.A and there are plenty of people in the chat room who
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:53.280]   know what it is and I have no clue what did you you this Microsoft has its own
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:58.560]   tools for this kind of stuff right Ben I mean they don't yeah no Microsoft they
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:03.520]   do everything it is yeah they do some of them are best and breeds on them or not
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:09.760]   but yes we won't name names yeah well that's the way you should do it boy
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:12.320]   there's so many stories I don't know where well let's start it with the the
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:20.960]   Beats Apple merger hmm it's a legend a legend I am okay what how many weeks
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:26.800]   now was it two weeks ago I said this is a bogus rumor last week I repeated it's
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:33.880]   a bogus rumor TechCrunch is saying hey 70% chance this is gonna happen here that
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:38.960]   sounds like science yeah 70 well absolutely it's not 68 it's not 72 it's
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:46.840]   70% chance that Wow now we're hearing starting to see cracks in the facade
[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:54.760]   some are saying that Tim Cook was very upset about Dr. Dre's video that he
[00:39:54.760 --> 00:40:00.120]   posted on Facebook and pulled down well well well well why did I miss what did
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:04.400]   he say you didn't know this no dude I missed all this stuff I'm not very savvy
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:09.360]   on this kind of thing rumor to say no no no cuz you can see somebody skimmed it
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:13.560]   and it's on YouTube I can't play it I meant Tim Cook is oh yeah no one knows
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:17.440]   what's yeah I think the whole thing never was it was it was gonna happen to
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:24.040]   begin with Walter Isaacson said the guy who wouldn't why would they well
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:29.360]   because beats is an extraordinarily powerful brand like there was well
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:35.240]   so is Betty Crocker but doesn't mean you buy it well I mean I don't know if it's
[00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:39.400]   there and you're sitting on a mountain of cash like Apple why not you could
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:43.520]   afford to buy the entire music industry do you really want dr. Dre at your board
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:47.840]   meetings from a you want his brand I mean here's the thing look at it this
[00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:53.520]   way you're telling me that if you asked any five people on the street what beats
[00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:56.800]   are you tell me that not one of them would know what it is everybody knows
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:00.960]   what beats is exactly that's the point is like you buy that brand but Apple's
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:04.720]   not in that business that's a headphone business Apple everybody knows what
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:08.560]   Apple is Apple doesn't need you know brand recognition they already have it
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:14.120]   yeah they're the number one brand in the world in many cases yeah the streaming
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:17.640]   service is good you know actually the funny part about the streaming services
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:22.440]   my original action we attitude was you know I respect dr. Dre but it's not my
[00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:25.760]   kind of music so I kind of stayed away from it and then when the story broke I
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:29.080]   actually checked out the service and it's actually a very good streaming service
[00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:32.600]   based on mall which I was a big fan of right but even though they must have
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:35.920]   liked particularly like dr. Dre's music it's still a good service and I don't
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:39.480]   know it's not a hip-hop that it's not streaming hip-hop it's every 20 million
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:43.560]   song just like everything else it's only flaw is that it came after everything
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:48.520]   else so it's last to the market and it has not received a lot of adoption I've
[00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:52.760]   I told the story before you know AT&T was offering a family deal 16 bucks for
[00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:56.480]   everybody to have unlimited access to music that's a considerable savings off
[00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:00.200]   the 10 bucks per person I was paying I went to my kids and they said no way we
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:04.040]   like Spotify we're happy with Pandora we don't want to know so there was a
[00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:08.160]   non-starter because they already established their you know they set it up
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:11.840]   I think I suspect you guys are playing the wrong game first of all you're a
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:15.120]   hundred percent right everything all of you guys have said is is a hundred
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:19.400]   percent right because beats is late they just bought mug or whatever in the
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:23.880]   streaming game however if you ask people on the streets they don't say any of
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:26.680]   that stuff they don't talk about beats streaming music service they talk
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:32.480]   no one thing they say they say failure exquisite presentation of music that is
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:37.000]   the brand of beats and in that regard Apple would be smart to pay a billion
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.640]   dollar tech crunch tech crunch further digging a hole John Big Sing oh it turns
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:46.760]   out it's an act higher you know where you hire somebody by buying their company
[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:50.680]   this is three days ago Apple beat steel is happening and it's a doctor
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:56.000]   Dre at choir 3.2 billion dollars to get dr. Dre in the executive suite and maybe
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:01.640]   J. Jimmy Iovine who was a very well-connected music and Ben you what do you
[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:09.600]   think a was there ever Apple beat steel B is it gonna happen see why a yes there
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:15.480]   was as far as I know B I think it likely will still happen
[00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:21.200]   interesting and see there is a very compelling case to be made for this
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:25.600]   deal and I think the case we made against it is is a little more subtle
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:29.560]   and different than I think most critics are making so you agree with the Brian
[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:34.400]   it's about the brand yeah well I think beats brings three very compelling things
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:40.360]   the table for Apple that fixes you know through three challenges for Apple one
[00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:45.120]   is the you know from a business model perspective the headphones are a lot like
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:50.080]   Apple products they're taking a quote unquote hardware commodity and they are
[00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:54.280]   selling at a significant premium based on kind of the what they are the
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:57.960]   experience of owning them the brand on the side and that's not to I'm not at all
[00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:02.600]   mean to cheap and what an Apple product is but the first of all you
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:06.640]   reason I described an Apple product what you said is a hundred percent
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:10.160]   correct keep well the different things brand a little beat up though I mean
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:14.120]   they've been sold and bought and sold and bought HTC bottom Lenovo I mean
[00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:20.400]   we're we're looking at it as a bunch of you know 30 40 50 year olds and the
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:24.200]   problem is that's the second keep going my
[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:36.720]   I was I was boom where for us Apple is the epitome of cool but times change and I
[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:44.680]   think for people who are in their teens or lower 20s beats is very much that
[00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:49.040]   that sort of brand it's the brand that you aspire to it's the brand that you
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:53.680]   want as as a present it you know if you look at any music video go back to
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:57.560]   Apple's iPhone launch event they had the iTunes festival video every headphone
[00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:01.560]   that video there were no white courts in that video they were all read for beats
[00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:06.200]   and that's and you I watch live NBA every single time they watch a player
[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:10.440]   coming into the stadium he's wearing beats headphones every athlete every
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:14.560]   entertainer all you know you that that lowercase be you see everywhere yeah
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:18.400]   because beats has been willing to spend a significant first of all they have
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:21.360]   huge profit margins they've been willing to spend a lot of that money and
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:24.960]   investment money on marketing they do I don't know what their marketing budget
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:29.920]   is but it's clearly huge every music video has a product beats product placement
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:35.160]   in it here's about a much they do you have a headphone I mean come on headphones
[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:39.840]   we're invented in the what 40s before that it doesn't talk like a 60 year old
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:46.160]   again Larry stop yes here's how we engage beats is success is that by the
[00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:50.800]   numbers beats is identical to Apple in that they do high margins they do premium
[00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:57.080]   million dollar revenue a year correct they also are identical to monster cables
[00:45:57.080 --> 00:46:01.960]   in that they they don't significantly have to make their head phones yeah but
[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:07.080]   they're they're a premium brand however unlike monster which is increasingly
[00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:11.320]   growing a reputation of being you know laughably hilariously you know like
[00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:16.760]   you know overpriced and stupid beats as dodge that beats as as in general
[00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:20.120]   maintain their brand is being an exquisite commodity and I think in that
[00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:25.440]   regard that that brand is worth Apple investing in I think a adagoki writing
[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:31.360]   in billboards says five things are holding up the deal one it's complicated
[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:37.360]   the biggest deal apples ever done Tim Cook's very first big deal to the leak
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:42.560]   didn't help the news was leaked too early Apple was nowhere near ready to have
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:45.760]   the deal and it's true Apple is not denied it nobody's come forward from
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:50.240]   saying no we're not interested perhaps they were just very early in the
[00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:57.840]   negotiations three the video now this is billboard sources they say this is our
[00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:01.680]   favorite bit of gossip from our sources apparently the Apple family near imploded
[00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:06.840]   without rage when the video went up on Facebook of an excited dr. Dre with
[00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:12.280]   Tyrese in the video they share in language unsuitable for a family
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:18.080]   program or blog how dr. Dre will be hip-hop's first billionaire and other nice
[00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:22.080]   things about Compton I'm just reading from the quite I don't know what that
[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:27.640]   was people often people often forget that despite Apple being this company
[00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:32.040]   they make sexy products with sexy profit margins and sexy retail outlets it's
[00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:37.800]   kind of conservative and Tim Cook kind of conservative and apparently this the
[00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:42.600]   reason this video is pulled down so fast from Facebook we're only watching the
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:47.040]   skim of it that somebody put up on YouTube apparently chief Keith let me
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:51.360]   close his man I don't know Leo that's that's hard for me to buy the idea that
[00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:56.240]   basically you know Tim Cook says stodgy white man who has a lot of money and
[00:47:56.240 --> 00:48:01.600]   therefore can't well of any of this though where do you put dr. Dre where do
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:06.160]   you put Jimmy Iovine I mean are you gonna put them in charge of content is
[00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:11.200]   that what do you do with them well that that I mean that is that is some two of
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:16.560]   the other reasons I think one is the fact is Apple you talk about Spotify is
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:20.680]   behind in streaming well if Spotify is behind then what is Apple right they're
[00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:25.040]   not even in the in the game and you know Apple is not a verse to buying
[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:28.640]   technology to get into something they bought iTunes for crying out loud I mean
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:33.920]   it's it's not a and in that get Apple has always owned music Apple's been
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:37.880]   synonymous with music and they're no longer the pre-end I understand but I
[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:43.280]   think Tim Cook has to swallow some real has to really think hard for instance you
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:48.800]   know dr. Dre has been as said some pretty misogynistic homophobic things in the
[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:56.240]   past I just find it hard to believe that Apple would absorb this I mean first of
[00:48:56.240 --> 00:49:00.080]   all I actually think legitimately that it would be worth a billion dollars for
[00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:04.640]   for them to make dr. Dre a brand ambassador for Apple I think that would
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:09.480]   be worth Apple Apple is in a late place environment for their their music
[00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:13.400]   streaming service if you can get a top here of a farther behind than beats is
[00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:17.840]   Wow exactly exactly right and so and so they're they're buying a first place
[00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:20.960]   ambassador for them I think it might be worth a billion dollars I don't know
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:26.400]   yeah I'm not a billion 3.2 billion how do you feel now Brian she was still worth
[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:29.920]   is still worth it in fact I was trying to say earlier Scott Johnson asked like
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:33.800]   how on earth does beats go for three billion and Twitch go for only one
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:37.680]   billion and the answer is quite simply for the brand value everybody knows who
[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:42.240]   beats is nobody knows who twitch.tv everybody who can everybody who matters
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:47.440]   knows who twitch.tv is well you kidding this is a huge revenue last year yeah
[00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:51.280]   beats made money and that's well I don't know how much money but given that
[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:55.800]   their profits are probably pretty high which dot TV I'm gonna say maybe one in
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:59.520]   twenty people on the street knows what that is matter it's a YouTube acquisition
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:03.200]   that YouTube people know that what's number one on YouTube is game videos this
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:06.680]   is the smartest thing YouTube could do well sure yes and you're a hundred
[00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:09.640]   percent right that has been the greatest innovation in the last ten years is
[00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:15.360]   machinima discovering that people love watching other people play video games
[00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:19.920]   and I was desperate to find an alternate to a drop shot and they found it
[00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:26.780]   we went out to Nintendo and he bad out out I don't know master chief
[00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:34.240]   crotch shot is in yeah that would be I personally find the whole Dre angle to
[00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:39.120]   me that's the more far-fetched one I don't see I don't see I see the Jimmy
[00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:44.800]   I mean being coming on board I I'm trouble seeing the Dre angle but just
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:49.680]   what I think the whole video thing is kind of overdone I mean honestly if the
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:54.520]   video if that celebration video was enough for Apple to not to scale deal
[00:50:54.520 --> 00:50:58.760]   with it I mean it's actually way more concerning than anything because that
[00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:03.600]   means Apple had no idea what they were buying right I mean you buy dr.
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:07.280]   Dre you're gonna get some videos yeah well I mean what's not just that it's
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:10.480]   that it's that though if the whole point is to get into the beats brand and the
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:14.960]   way he reaches a new generation that's why it reaches that's very mild by hip
[00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:19.240]   up standards I mean it it I mean it's hip-hop is is I'm not I'm no hip-hop
[00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:25.840]   expert at all but it's very much a very honest genre that the whole point is to
[00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:31.040]   hold nothing back talk very clearly about you know your feelings and I mean
[00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:34.280]   I'm I'm totally generalizing I'm not a hip-hop extra at all but the whole point
[00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:39.320]   being like if they didn't know it then that that's the way things would might
[00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:43.400]   go down then that's that's concerning from an Apple perspective and I doubt
[00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:46.840]   the video I think was more of the week like the in the financial times the
[00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:50.600]   Wall Street Journal that it was very specific from what I've heard it came
[00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:56.560]   from the beat side and that's something that Apple we know very well is does not
[00:51:56.560 --> 00:52:01.480]   enjoy that's true I don't know like Ben keeps saying he's not a hip-hop expert
[00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:05.000]   I'm I'm pretty sure that the only way to tell for sure is for us to drop a beat
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:09.120]   and for us to hear him freestyle for a little bit I want a little freestyling
[00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:16.280]   when we come back Ben Thompson will freestyle his this chair will be
[00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:16.880]   mysteriously
[00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:23.920]   I'm all right our show today you wanted to know what Harry's was I will tell you
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:27.400]   I will tell you how to talk it up Harry's all right Harry's what do we got
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:32.880]   Harry's so the guy one of the guys Jeff who started Warby Parker it started
[00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:38.040]   this Harry's about a year ago something like that Andy and Jeff started it they
[00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:41.240]   realized that there really is you know if you go to the store and you and you
[00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:46.640]   look at the the fusion razor system you know you get the you get the handle you
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:50.640]   get three blades you now out 40 bucks and then I don't know what we're talking
[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:55.720]   five six bucks a blade from then on there's these are terrible prices in
[00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:59.360]   fact the razors are so expensive that they nowadays you can't buy them off the
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:05.520]   shelf you have to get a clerk to unlock protection system it's true I think it's
[00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:09.680]   crazy you know so they said you know I think there's an opportunity I mean I
[00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:13.480]   don't want to start rumors but I'm I heard somewhere and this may not be true
[00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:18.480]   but I heard that the blades of everyone else are made from the bones of children
[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:23.800]   in Africa I don't know you know they call them blood razors and I don't I don't
[00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:27.880]   know so Harry's they make their blades by the way they have their own factory in
[00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:32.360]   Germany so they're I mean these are really good height you know German steel
[00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:36.520]   German blades the best in the world for strength and sharpness I'm showing you
[00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:40.840]   this is the this is the Winston kit they have a Truman kit and they have a
[00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:45.040]   Winston kit and then I'm ordering one right now what's the difference the
[00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:49.560]   Winston kit has the metal and you can get it engraved this is a metal handle and
[00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:52.440]   you get engraved it's twenty five dollars if you want the engraving I think that
[00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:56.000]   costs a few bucks more the Truman is a little less expensive it has a plastic
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:00.160]   blade you know it's funny some people fret not played plastic handle them some
[00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:06.880]   people prefer the Truman because the handle is you know it's funny we we sent
[00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:10.600]   the Winston to Steve Gibson and he ended up going back and ordering a Truman
[00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:14.320]   because he wanted the handle was a flatter there was a different feel to it
[00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:18.480]   but I'm going to write this minute get the Truman to fifteen dollars you get the
[00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:23.280]   handle three blades a tube of shave cream so it's a month of shaving for 15 bucks
[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:29.520]   and then you can get I mean you can get replacement blades the design is really
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:33.400]   well done you know it's a lot of these very hard to eject the blades this just
[00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:38.200]   pops right off very easily but it but it's a sure attachment it's the best
[00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:41.440]   shave you ever had and it comes with something that will actually transform
[00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:45.720]   your shave it's more than just the blade it's the Harry's shave cream which is
[00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:53.080]   quite remarkable it is not a lot not a you know aerosol can it comes in a tube
[00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:56.600]   it's good for the environment smells fabulous and will give you the smoothest
[00:54:56.600 --> 00:55:01.240]   cleanest shave you ever had it's a Leo never the reason I'm actually ordering
[00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:04.240]   one and paying for it is that even though you sent Steve Gibson a free one of
[00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:09.320]   it I can afford $15 I want you to send me that $327 he'll microphone yeah we'll
[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:13.040]   send you the microphone you buy the razor I'll buy the razor I'm not done this is
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:16.960]   so I don't even I don't even need the cream the cream smells I'll say
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:20.960]   universally man if you've never spoiled yourself on a razor just worth it it's

[00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:36.080]   shopping gonna change experience a book buying yeah they were great until they
[00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:40.640]   got a monopoly now they're just screwing with everybody Matthew Ingram writes a
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:43.560]   great comp like we should get Matthew want to talk about this giant
[00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:48.800]   behaving badly this is in giga oh Google Facebook and Amazon show us the
[00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:55.400]   downside of monopolies and black box algorithms the latest on Amazon is this
[00:57:55.400 --> 00:58:00.320]   has shut thing yeah so I don't know anything about this walk me through this
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:04.160]   you don't know anything about anything Brian you did that now with every story
[00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:08.520]   well I mean this is what happens Leo what do you do you just do magic all day
[00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:14.760]   you don't you don't read the tech news anything I represent the every man
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:19.240]   that's what I do Leo and I do that very well I know that the rigor it's you
[00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:24.080]   should read for president to work well for Reagan and Bush so this comes from
[00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:29.680]   the New York Times as publishers fight Amazon books vanish the story began with
[00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:33.440]   Hashette which is one of the big five a French publisher but they have little
[00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:37.680]   Brown a lot of other imprints they're a very very big publisher and we don't
[00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:42.080]   know exactly why Hashette got on Amazon's bad side but of course you could
[00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:45.960]   speculate it might have something to do with Amazon hot shot list yeah they are
[00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:50.080]   got on their Hashette list the Amazon demanding maybe it's good then that's
[00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:53.400]   good you might want to make that the headline that's good
[00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:58.480]   that's been been came up with that the Hashette list maybe they were trying to
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:02.320]   get a better deal from Hashette on the cost of the books etc what happened
[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:05.400]   first was that a lot of Hashette titles including Malcolm Gladwell's the
[00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:09.920]   tipping point outliers all his books were suddenly two to three weeks delayed
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:14.160]   you could nor even though you could go to a bookstore today and get him you
[00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:17.640]   could go to a third-party seller and get him Hashette said no we sent him
[00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:21.280]   boxes of them they got tons of them Amazon saying no it's gonna be delayed
[00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:25.400]   now they're cracking down it's even worse this is Brad Stone's book which I
[00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:29.000]   highly recommend the everything store Jeff Bezos in the age of Amazon
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:35.720]   currently unavailable what you cannot buy other reason to that you came as I
[00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:40.560]   did not like this book at all yes right yeah you cannot buy it on Amazon
[00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:46.880]   this is you know yeah isn't that weird I mean first of all like I'm really
[00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:50.880]   conflicted as far as Amazon I actually deeply adore once I became a
[00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:56.360]   member right like we love the ability to to click a thing and have it be there
[00:59:56.360 --> 01:00:00.800]   the next day and so on and of course you know weird promises of robot drones
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:05.280]   bringing us our stuff is very appealing however you know they're
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:10.480]   their business along with efficiency comes all of the baggage that we
[01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:15.040]   associate with Walmart right like like we we all date Walmart for whatever
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:19.680]   reason like for example not talking efficiency here though we're talking
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:24.440]   Amazon really acting in a way that violates the antitrust act look at this
[01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:29.080]   this is it looks like you may never have heard of Robert Galbraith his new
[01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:34.280]   novel the silkworm a calmerin strike novel this is JK Rowling this is her
[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:38.760]   pseudonym yeah this book is out or about to come out I'm not sure it's not
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:44.360]   available on Amazon currently unavailable on Amazon the girls of August a big
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:51.560]   and Rivers a sitting bestseller can you order it on Amazon unavailable on Amazon
[01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:57.320]   so what's the question people are speculating you know that Amazon I love
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:01.040]   Amazon - I'm a prime member I get stuff all the time but but it has had a pretty
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:05.560]   negative impact on local booksellers and it's essentially owns the online
[01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:09.200]   book selling market I mean is this an example that they're flexing their
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:12.440]   muscles and that they are an evil company and that they're gonna have a
[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:17.200]   negative impact on our freedom to read that's the big fear right that that some
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:21.140]   people expressed at the very beginning when Amazon became literally the
[01:01:21.140 --> 01:01:25.800]   Amazon of the book industry and and there are those who think that this is
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:31.160]   you know proof of the pudding that that they are in fact using their power to to
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:34.280]   control what we read I mean I don't I think it's more of a business issue but
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:38.800]   it's a scary thought I mean is that is that the claim Larry that they're that
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:43.400]   they're actually trying to to screw over like by not making certain things
[01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:46.000]   available they're trying to screw over local books I was like what's their
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.160]   angle on this I don't understand why they would stand on this doesn't screw
[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:51.920]   over local books but the point is that there's so many local bookstore that are
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:55.600]   gone out of business yeah they already screwed them over Brian put them out of
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:59.860]   business now they have monopoly power and now they're screwing publishers
[01:01:59.860 --> 01:02:04.360]   authors and ultimately readers by wielding that monopoly power you know in
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:08.000]   the New Yorker in February there was an article that said Amazon is bad for
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.760]   books and I poo poo I think I poo pooed on this show I said yeah you know come
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:16.480]   on Amazon's great I mean yes admittedly we're losing our bookstores but Amazon
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:22.160]   sells books and they're they love books and boy I think George Packer was right
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:26.960]   I think it didn't take too long for us to realize this is the this is the
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:30.000]   problem that you're getting out I mean leaving aside whether it's antitrust or
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:37.440]   not I'm not an antitrust lawyer you know the big issue is Amazon kind of got
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:41.400]   the benefit of the doubt with a lot of this stuff because they so relentlessly
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:46.200]   frame themselves is doing what's best for right customer and so and so even
[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:49.560]   when it came to these book disputes previously there's one with Beck Millen
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:53.560]   I think was back millen four or five years ago they pulled similar tactics
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:56.720]   yeah they could say we're doing it because we want to make sure there's the
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:02.320]   lowest price and and so even if you disliked what they were doing to the
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:06.000]   market you could say well it is true they've been consistently trying to have
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:09.760]   those prices I can see their angle that being good for the consumer the
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:17.680]   problem is now it's by making books unavailable and doing it on purpose like
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:23.120]   this is Amazon's choosing to do it they are proving that the consumer
[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:27.480]   actually isn't their top priority because if it was their top priority they would
[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:32.160]   keep the books available well negotiating in the background and that's the bigger
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:36.160]   danger for Amazon beyond any sort of legal remedy that may or may not arise
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:40.520]   whether or not they violated anything it's I think not just you for a lot of
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:46.440]   people it's kind of lifting the veil that Amazon had very successfully put in
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:50.200]   place that yeah we may do stuff that you find a little uncomfortable we may be
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:52.840]   killing local bookstores blah blah blah blah but we're doing it because it's
[01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:56.440]   best for the consumer well now there's an example they did something that wasn't
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:04:00.600]   best for the consumer you use the word Walmart Brian it is a lot like Walmart
[01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:03.840]   well there's a fantastic book called the Walmart effect where one of the
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:07.840]   examples they give is a previous to Walmart every time you ever bought
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:12.720]   deodorant it always came in a box and Walmart one of the effects you know and
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:16.400]   again there's all kinds of legitimate reasons to be upset with Walmart but
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:19.600]   one of the things they figured out is like wow we're wasting you know 10 to
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:25.200]   15 cents per package to have cardboard printed to put this this in this is
[01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:29.800]   stupid so they worked with the with the deodorant matter manufacturers and nowadays
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:35.640]   purely because of Walmart they cut out five to 15 cents per product out there
[01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:38.880]   and and it didn't just happen for Walmart I happened for all of the other
[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:43.640]   ones you you go to anywhere now you can't find deodorant inside of a cardboard
[01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:47.320]   box anymore and that's all because of Walmart and and it's like I understand
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:51.720]   like like there there is efficiency what we all want is for content creators and
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:55.400]   for the people who make the products to get a bigger chunk of it and and do
[01:04:55.400 --> 01:05:00.040]   having more efficient structure but on the other hand it's like man it's it's a
[01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:05.720]   Amazon is not nice to people who own the content my my fire reading book is
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:09.920]   $39.99 is the retail price for it because we didn't want to make the
[01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:14.720]   cheapest book to teach how to you fire but but Amazon you really don't want
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:18.960]   budget fire eaters you're really looking for a higher class of fire like nobody
[01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:22.520]   says I want to learn to eat fire and I want to pay as little as humanly
[01:05:22.520 --> 01:05:28.120]   possible right and so and but but like meanwhile like they have these
[01:05:28.120 --> 01:05:33.400]   aggressive rates I think I think I make like 1550 per book like like two-thirds
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:37.600]   of the profit goes to Amazon for that stuff so yeah but it by the way if you
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.880]   had published with a regular publisher you'd have made a buck 50 a book right
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:48.400]   so in one respect authors if they you know do it the Amazon where are gonna do
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:51.800]   better it's a good plan I just don't like to see a company and then yeah it's
[01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:55.040]   great that the owner doesn't come in boxes but it but what's scary is that a
[01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:57.840]   company has that kind of power and can wield it and I think you nailed it
[01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:02.360]   Ben Amazon supposedly cared about customers more than anything else and
[01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:06.440]   this yeah this is a very much the of the whole deal between networks and cable
[01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:10.840]   companies what was it time Warner blocked CBS programming for a while
[01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:14.760]   because they were very much to a deal and the consumers you know the the
[01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:21.400]   viewers the ones that were hurt by that nobody expected to love us
[01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:25.800]   that was no but apples to the same thing when there was when a publisher
[01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:29.080]   published a negative or actually wasn't even a negative book but a book that's
[01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:33.240]   an unauthorized yeah biographies Steve Jobs you remember this Steve pulled that
[01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:35.640]   publisher's books from the Apple Store he said well what we're just not gonna
[01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:40.040]   sell your books but the Apple Store did not dominate the book selling marketplace
[01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:46.520]   Amazon does right and this is a little scary so part two of Matthew's excellent
[01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:52.760]   column talks about Matt Howie and Metaphilter Metaphilter which is a site
[01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:57.320]   some of you remember from the earliest days of the internet a great link site
[01:06:57.320 --> 01:07:03.160]   it's still around Metaphilter.com but something has happened to Metaphilter
[01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:09.000]   and their Google ranking has just tumbled and it's cost them 40% of their ad
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:16.440]   revenue and his point Matt Howie's point he writes this in the medium
[01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:21.000]   is that you know we could be out of business because of something that
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.840]   happened at Google that we don't know about understand perhaps Google feels
[01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:28.440]   like the links on Metaphilter because that's what it is is a link a link
[01:07:28.440 --> 01:07:32.200]   collection just like all blogs were originally maybe they feel like these
[01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:37.080]   are not legitimate links or whatever he says 90% of our revenue comes from
[01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:40.920]   Google AdSense that's how you know we do take subscriptions but very few people
[01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:46.760]   pay money for it over the last 13 years Metaphilter is 13 years old
[01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:52.200]   traffic has grown steadily over our sites as has revenue it's allowed us to
[01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:57.640]   get our increase our staff to eight people with full health dental iCare
[01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:05.640]   a 401k you know sane hours he's laying people off and he says and I don't know
[01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:09.240]   why Metaphilter has lost 40% of its
[01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:13.560]   track ask Metaphilter has lost 40% of its traffic overnight
[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:17.880]   all right look i'm gonna say something might not be popular but it's like
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:21.960]   look at the graph before you say anything okay i will look at the graph because
[01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:26.440]   the graph is kind of telling it's sudden sure sure but you know what this is
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:29.960]   what it means when you build your business on another business even says
[01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:34.360]   that he says live by the google die by the google yeah yeah
[01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:40.920]   uh yeah but on you know this is a case i'm not saying it's very very
[01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:45.960]   similar to the amazon case where we have given a company google all power
[01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:50.360]   if you are not listed on google if you don't show up number one in the search
[01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:54.440]   you don't exist you of course you still have your website
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:09:00.440]   but but no one can find you and i i don't care if you're on bing
[01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:05.720]   right now it happened to me actually my safekids.com site
[01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:10.440]   took some ads that google didn't like i kind of made a mistake and i
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:13.000]   went to these text link ads for just a little while
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:17.240]   and i went from number one and number two in the listings on online safety to
[01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:21.320]   becoming invisible when i realized a mistake i took the ads down and i
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:25.000]   eventually kind of crawled my way back up i'm still not number one yet
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.760]   but it's a very big mistake if you do something
[01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:33.400]   that pisses off google and i didn't you know i didn't mean to do that
[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:37.000]   uh but but but you know they have a huge amount of cloud and you don't want it
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.200]   to happen well whatever cloud we have i'm going to send people to meta filter
[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:43.880]   dot com if you ever use meta filter if you like meta filter go there
[01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:47.960]   uh matt's trying to raise the money to keep meta filter alive
[01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:50.520]   uh because you're not going to make the money
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:53.960]   uh go with it the bigger problem is that he has no idea what
[01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:57.960]   why he did it i mean you knew it was his ads right exactly
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:04.120]   and that's and you know meta filters meta filter wasn't like uh some like
[01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:07.640]   the demand media stuff where they weren't at all explicitly built on google
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:12.200]   like they existed first and they predate google then that's right
[01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:17.480]   right and then google you know it it's not like they chose to be propped up by
[01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:22.120]   google it's it that was the way things went and and
[01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:25.240]   i mean i mean whether or not the intended thing i they worked to give
[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:27.880]   towards in the mouth or something of that effect but the problem is
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:33.080]   is google has this power and no one know and the problem is not knowing not
[01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:37.320]   knowing why it happened where the issue was and and i think this is this is
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:40.520]   i think one of matthews broader points and it's the same thing with amazon
[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:44.040]   uh and facebook this week i mean there's that that that the guy on facebook
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:47.960]   complaining about the the quality of news um like
[01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:50.680]   i feel like a lot of these tech companies and one of the great things about tech
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:54.120]   is the very idealistic way that people you know look at that they're changing
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:57.480]   the world and and this sort of thing and and
[01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:01.960]   there's i think almost an ignorance about the power that they're wielding
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:06.040]   and it's it's really it's dangerous i mean it's it's messing with
[01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:12.600]   uh like people's livelihoods in this case and i i feel like personally just
[01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:15.640]   in general i think matthews article is very good like techniques get a lot
[01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:19.560]   more so these kinds of be a lot more serious about the power that they have
[01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:23.720]   and if they don't get serious uh the seriousness will be put on them
[01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:26.520]   like it was from microsoft in the 90s for example right
[01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:31.480]   i love uh i love uh mark and dreason's uh tweet on all this he says if we could
[01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:35.640]   only get monopolies to run as well as private company subject to competition
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:38.600]   everything would be great we gain benefits from the monopolies that
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:42.520]   google and amazon wheeled absolutely but we just got to get them to
[01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:45.720]   act as if they have a competent competition the nature right i think
[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:49.320]   this is the challenge is the nature of so much technology uh like it
[01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:55.800]   naturally monopolizes right yeah i mean if google by virtue of being the largest
[01:11:55.800 --> 01:11:59.000]   search engine all things being equal is going to
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.640]   increase its lead over the second place search engine just because it has more
[01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:04.120]   searches i mean and that's the case in lots these
[01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:07.480]   businesses where there's the network effect and returns to scale
[01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:12.280]   uh like technology by its nature lends itself to monopoly
[01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:17.560]   and so this is this is going to be this is not new it's not it's going to
[01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:21.160]   keep happening it's going to keep getting worse the more industries that are
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:25.400]   affected by technology and um and it's something that i think we as an
[01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:28.520]   industry need to start thinking a lot more
[01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:33.160]   deeply about brian is our free market uh libertarian you have a you have a
[01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:37.880]   solution brian i i don't know i mean that's a very courteous way of you saying
[01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:40.920]   let's listen to the crazy person's point of view and the crazy person's point of
[01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:46.680]   degree with you i am i am with you i am with you i am with you i don't i don't
[01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:52.440]   like seeing anybody lose their job but at the end of the day if the net
[01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:57.640]   core value of meta filter is to serve only as a middleman to hand people off
[01:12:57.640 --> 01:13:01.800]   from google to the site that they go to i mean i don't i don't i don't know that
[01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:05.160]   the world is a better place for having that extra step in there you know and
[01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:09.240]   it's like it's really up to it's it's up to the world to decide you know i
[01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:12.600]   hopefully what'll happen is that meta filter has their own core audience they
[01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:16.360]   have their own passionate fans who go to melt meta filter as their alternative
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:19.720]   to google and that they live and thrive and survive on their own but but again
[01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:24.040]   it's like if that's not the case i i don't i don't know what to tell you and you
[01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:27.480]   can make a very strong case that the world is a much better place because of the
[01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:32.200]   existence of google i mean uh the google's changed the world the fact that you can
[01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:37.800]   yeah we we're so uh inured to the advances that we live with we don't
[01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:42.440]   really even feel them but think about this i can go to google.com
[01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:47.560]   enter in a fairly complex search term and literally within a second
[01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:51.960]   get definitive answers to almost any questions and it doesn't take it five
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:57.000]   seconds or 30 seconds or a minute it's within a second that's what's beautiful
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:00.920]   Leo is that no matter what your question is you can find out that you have
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:05.480]   cancer immediately well you know no it's one of the
[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:08.760]   it's fundamentally changed the way we acquire information it's amazing
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:14.280]   it's i mean on a level that that it's beyond profound i mean i think about
[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:18.440]   you know i just typed it out as the empire state building yeah in less time than
[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:22.680]   it took me to type the answer the question it gave me the answer it already knows
[01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:26.520]   we could have spoken it's what thousand two hundred fifty feet
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:31.080]   yeah in fact now that's one nice feature all uh chrome uh operating systems
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:34.440]   if you're on a google tab you can you just say okay google how tall is the
[01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:37.880]   empire state building but it will still give you the answer faster than it took
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:41.080]   to say that you know what's fascinating leo is to see
[01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:45.240]   the next generation uh their whole attitudes about what they expect out of
[01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:48.360]   technology uh is changed for example my daughter
[01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:52.600]   she's ten years old she has no expectation of ever finishing any
[01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:56.200]   question she ever writes into google she types the first few letters
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:59.320]   and then she looks at the autocompletes and then clicks on it that's interesting
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:02.520]   knows it'll be in there if i type how you have to spell it right either tall
[01:15:02.520 --> 01:15:06.280]   look at that all i have to do is to how and the very next thing is how tall is
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:11.000]   the empire state building exactly right i don't even have to finish the type
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:15.480]   wow all right that's a man that is mind boggling and we're so used to it
[01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:18.920]   that is mind boggling but that's wonderful man work
[01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:22.280]   i don't think this is a i don't think like anyone's making a controversial
[01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:26.120]   statement here i mean that that's the point is is amazon has done great things
[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:30.120]   as well and if it were you know pure evil then it'd be a lot
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:35.000]   easier to take a a position on these sort of things and and i and that's the
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.600]   point is like you know google has done great things and that's
[01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:42.040]   that's the meta filter issues they all meta-filtership never
[01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:45.960]   you know um take advantage of the google track that they got organically like
[01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:49.240]   they've never been one of those like seo like
[01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:52.680]   scammer sort of things like they just started getting more google traffic
[01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:57.080]   because they had good content and google because it's a good search engine
[01:15:57.080 --> 01:16:00.920]   link to them like and so you're you're almost arguing against yourself
[01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:03.560]   ryan and saying that like oh they shouldn't have
[01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:08.680]   google's so good but they should have like ignored all that traffic by google
[01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:11.320]   being a doing a good job like the promises of google
[01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:14.920]   started funneling them all this traffic because they were a good site and google
[01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:19.560]   was doing its job and then suddenly google changed its mind basically
[01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:24.360]   um and and the promise like like any smart business owner they they
[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:27.000]   and they had to scale with it right that the whole thing with meta-filter is
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.800]   it's all moderated right like there's not a much credible
[01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:33.720]   at the end of the day meta-filter is competing against google
[01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:36.840]   and meta and google has no responsibility to
[01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:40.920]   meta-filter is a place where people go to learn things right and uh
[01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:44.360]   they derived a trend just benefit from google sending them a lot of links or
[01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:47.400]   whatever and then uh and then a support like for example of reddit i love
[01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:51.080]   reddit it's it's great to get on there but at the end of the day uh
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:55.240]   when i type in i want to find a thing do i want you to point me to
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:59.320]   the reddit article of today i learned that this thing is a thing no i want to
[01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:02.440]   go to the thing that's that that that that makes no
[01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:05.960]   sense google is not generating i'm good at that i did that
[01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:08.920]   i'm not the answers no i mean the point is without
[01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:11.720]   sites like there has to be a place to go that's right
[01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:15.080]   there has to be it's not the answer from google you're right it's it's it's a
[01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:18.040]   index that's all well and speaking of great things
[01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:22.360]   google just did this photo stories thing and the google plus
[01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:24.920]   again it's like you're giving me all this free stuff
[01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:27.960]   at this point i'm starting to feel like what are they up to
[01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:33.560]   what is their sneaky plan have you seen the photo stories thing it's amazing
[01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:38.920]   uh so uh do you know what breaking news yeah uh no i haven't seen anything
[01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:43.960]   go ahead and watch me through this actually i actually met a filter
[01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:47.480]   meta-filter should be happy because they're they're the uh they're getting
[01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:50.920]   what the european commission want which is the right to be forgotten yeah
[01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:54.040]   there you go whether you want to you wanted the right to be forgotten
[01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:58.520]   you wanted it you asked for it here it is there it is yep so i do you ever put
[01:17:58.520 --> 01:18:01.800]   stuff on google plus uh brian or put photo do you have your phone
[01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:06.680]   uploading photos to uh google you know i i i disabled that because uh
[01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:10.200]   you're not getting the benefit of letting the google hive mind
[01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:14.440]   have access to all of your most deepest personal thoughts and images
[01:18:14.440 --> 01:18:18.520]   by which you mean i haven't been seduced by the beast no sir i have not
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:21.720]   no it takes this conversation full circle i mean
[01:18:21.720 --> 01:18:25.000]   if you go back to microsoft in the surface you could argue in windows a could
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.200]   arguably say the problem with it is they were doing it because microsoft
[01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:32.120]   needed it not because consumers needed it uh and i mean it's a very similar
[01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:35.080]   thing with google plus i mean i think google plus in general i think is much
[01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:38.840]   more about identity um now everyone's logged in when they use
[01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:42.760]   google whether they realize it or not and to that i think it's a success but
[01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:48.600]   the actual like google plus service itself um google needs it to exist so it exists
[01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:52.920]   um i'm not you know that the reason why none of us were immediately familiar
[01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:56.040]   with what you're talking about is because none of us nobody uses us
[01:18:56.040 --> 01:19:01.560]   yeah so look it takes your pictures i for some reason i can't get into mine
[01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:06.520]   and it turns you into Chad johnson it turns you and it makes a photo album with
[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:11.160]   maps and little captions and stuff for of different things you've done so
[01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:15.080]   this is Chad this is Chad's trip home or somewhere
[01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:18.760]   and uh to boston to boston debase and it just does it on a map
[01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:22.200]   there he met jesus i met jesus the gamer
[01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:27.960]   wow that's weird um it just does it it's gone through all of my photos since
[01:19:27.960 --> 01:19:33.240]   2007 and two yeah that's probably it goes into all of your photos including the
[01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:36.680]   ones that you don't want to share i mean that's the problem and and so
[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:40.920]   but you're not sharing them it's just uh only i can see this cute album
[01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:44.520]   okay well this is this is actually where the money's at i think there are two
[01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:47.480]   big things that people that are going to explode number one
[01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:50.680]   uh we all have a ton of photos and a lot of them are high quality and they're
[01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:54.760]   paying to figure out where they are and what they're doing exactly like i i
[01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:57.240]   cannot tell you like i spent i wasted like an
[01:19:57.240 --> 01:20:01.880]   hour looking for one photo that i vaguely remembered uh a friend of mine was was
[01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:05.320]   talking about like september 11th merchandise or something and i was like oh
[01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:09.400]   yeah i took a photo of like after september 11th
[01:20:09.400 --> 01:20:13.720]   there was this gift shop yeah and they said they had a sign that said all
[01:20:13.720 --> 01:20:16.360]   september 11th merchandise 50 percent off oh god
[01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:19.960]   i thought that was offensive yes when was that again and i
[01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:24.440]   wasted a stupid hour going through that stuff if we could get context awareness
[01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:28.040]   from our apps that do that uh and and the second thing also
[01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:32.120]   is also like a curation algorithm something that can look at the composition
[01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:35.800]   of a photograph and say i say three i see three faces here it doesn't there's a
[01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:39.400]   lot of wasted space over here yeah let's crop that let's make this happen
[01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:41.640]   it's doing all sorts of super smart stuff as
[01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:45.160]   hammy too in the chat room says this is awesome and kind of scary at the same
[01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:49.480]   time and that kind of sums up this whole thing i would just stop it awesome it's

[01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:17.080]   80 year old man i should be wearing a top hat
[01:24:17.080 --> 01:24:20.040]   mnemonical with a big mustache i've got
[01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:23.240]   products and brick bats

[01:24:27.480 --> 01:24:30.520]   you go uh other notes just speak to the book you
[01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:35.000]   i want to plot it to brick bats man that's a money set
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:38.760]   tell a little brick bats for ebay ebay apparently at the beginning of the
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:42.760]   month learned that it had been at majorly hacked
[01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:46.600]   and they thought maybe we did not tell anybody about this about Wednesday of
[01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:48.600]   last week i heard about this
[01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:52.120]   immediately went to my ebay account no word no
[01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:54.680]   warning so i thought well i'm changing the password
[01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:59.880]   finally now if you go to ebay.com you'll see important password update
[01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:03.480]   uh they have a part of the problem is they have 145 million users
[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:07.640]   every one of them needs to change their password
[01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:10.760]   they say they're going to send uh they're going to send out emails but it's
[01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:12.920]   going to take a while to that many people
[01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:16.680]   we don't know what you do how much uh has been compromised that's the big
[01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:18.920]   problem yeah what what i recommend everybody
[01:25:18.920 --> 01:25:21.880]   does and i talked to Steve Gibson about this and he did you really would you
[01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:24.840]   talk to Steve Gibbs sure uh well we were in the hot tub together
[01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:28.680]   together he said i'll give you a product to
[01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:32.280]   brick bats so is when it comes time to enter your
[01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:36.360]   password just mash your keyboard a bunch and then every time you log into
[01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:40.280]   that site just to say i got my password right and then have them send you an email
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:45.240]   then you can be different every time i think that is not Steve Gibson's idea but
[01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:48.120]   thank you for thank you for blaming him for that
[01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:52.280]   inanity i give you a brick bat stuff for that
[01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:56.200]   three brick bats no plot it's for me sir no side
[01:25:56.200 --> 01:26:02.760]   no sir so um i you know this is another case very much like target where the
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:06.040]   company is not really saying exactly what happened
[01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:10.520]   apparently enough to they enough concern that they want everybody to
[01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:14.680]   uh change their passwords ebay saying people didn't get any financial
[01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:18.840]   information right uh they did not properly encrypt the
[01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:22.120]   passwords apparently they were encrypted but not in a way that was
[01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:27.240]   effective um so they were very much worried about this they say it's a
[01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:31.800]   precautionary measure um credit cards apparently not
[01:26:31.800 --> 01:26:36.840]   swiped but name date of birth email address physical address
[01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:39.880]   yes everything you need for a dandy theft
[01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:43.640]   every basically everything you need for a dandy theft right exactly
[01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:48.840]   um now remember that the ceo and cto of target lost their jobs over this i
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:51.960]   don't know what's going to happen at ebay we're also remember that ebay is
[01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:55.880]   owned by paypal i certainly hope this is in a reflection
[01:26:55.880 --> 01:27:00.600]   on ebay owns paypal or people own zb i mean ebay ebay ebay owns
[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:04.360]   ebay owns paypal that's right ebay on paypal who knows who the hell owns
[01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:07.640]   anybody right ebay on ebay is bigger so i think they
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:10.040]   own paypal they own paypal absolutely yeah
[01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:14.520]   apparently this did not affect the paypal security system but gosh is good
[01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:19.880]   i hope not um
[01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:23.560]   the uh data will be according to vice president chief
[01:27:23.560 --> 01:27:27.320]   technical officer mccaffey uh roger samani
[01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:31.640]   inevitably the data that will stone will be sold online
[01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:37.640]   you are at great risk if you use the same password on multiple sites
[01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:41.480]   it's just bad all around so i knowing general
[01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:46.600]   that you leo are uncomfortable with uh with private corporations having
[01:27:46.600 --> 01:27:51.080]   uh you know your biometric data but does not really i gave google everything
[01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:55.240]   right with uh i mean does this make you comfortable with the idea of of
[01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:58.200]   thumbprints or what is the way to authenticate
[01:27:58.200 --> 01:28:01.720]   i mean i mean it's like because somebody could copy that right i mean the real
[01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:04.440]   the real issue is that these companies are not
[01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:09.720]   are not adequately securing their servers they're not storing the
[01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:12.840]   information all this information should have been stored hash with a salted
[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:19.480]   hash none of it was all they're just not doing a good job of securing stuff
[01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:23.720]   uh and the problem is we don't even know frankly
[01:28:23.720 --> 01:28:27.480]   uh we don't even know how they're doing we don't know what's been stolen
[01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:31.800]   um you know it's they're not very forthcoming with the information about
[01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:34.200]   this kind of stuff they'd even delay telling people to the
[01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:36.680]   and there's essentially nothing we can do that there's nothing you can change
[01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:39.880]   your password but you can't you can't clean up the mess afterwards right
[01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:42.840]   i mean the target breach it's particularly annoying what did what did people do
[01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:45.960]   wrong they use a credit card a target yeah and they will you should never have
[01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:49.880]   done that that was a mistake but but keep in mind also and this is
[01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:53.880]   important is is remember at the end of the day like your liability for fraudulent
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:57.000]   credit card purposes if you're purchases is zero
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:00.280]   is zero here's i'll give you a ability but well ebay's a little different so for
[01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:02.360]   instance say somebody gets my ebay account
[01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:06.520]   goes in says oh i look at this leo's selling his uh mustang
[01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:10.760]   for uh twenty thousand dollars let's just change that to 20 cents
[01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:13.080]   uh they change it then they go back and they buy it
[01:29:13.080 --> 01:29:15.320]   or something like that i mean it's also like
[01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:19.640]   problems paypal paypal i i believe like like people think of paypal like a
[01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:22.520]   banking institution they are not they don't they don't know
[01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:25.320]   be able to use rules they do they can freeze your money anytime they want
[01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:28.520]   yeah it's all fraudulent they take all your money yeah
[01:29:28.520 --> 01:29:31.560]   by the way not every country has those protections you know the credit card
[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:34.440]   protections we have in this country that's really global
[01:29:34.440 --> 01:29:36.120]   they're there are countries where you don't have the
[01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:39.960]   and i'm not sure that's um a good thing in the united states that we have this
[01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:42.440]   protection because it's let everybody just go well who cares you're not going to
[01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:47.160]   lose one fifty bucks well we're just because you were talking about how
[01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:50.760]   the move now is to chip and pin technology by the end of next year
[01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:54.840]   credit ships yeah yeah well i mean the the problem
[01:29:54.840 --> 01:29:58.760]   the problem here is um first of all they were salt and hash they're using
[01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:01.640]   ebay's proprietary technique i think the problem is no one knows what that
[01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:04.360]   technique was um so that's that's part of the
[01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:06.760]   they were just encrypted but oh so you're saying they were
[01:30:06.760 --> 01:30:09.960]   asked they they were but but ebay's like it's
[01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:13.480]   it's our own proprietary one and no one kind of knows what that might be
[01:30:13.480 --> 01:30:16.920]   um so that's it's it's even more of a black box in many ways
[01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:20.520]   but the bigger issue here is is there's no one
[01:30:20.520 --> 01:30:24.760]   there's no one one it's an extremely hard problem i think it's easy to sit
[01:30:24.760 --> 01:30:27.000]   here and say that everyone should do a better job
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:32.680]   um the problem is is one it's hard to secure a computer system by definition
[01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:37.000]   two uh passwords are really hard for regular people to to manage
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:41.080]   effectively um but but the broader issue is no one's
[01:30:41.080 --> 01:30:45.080]   really properly incentivized to fix this i mean you you're getting at that with
[01:30:45.080 --> 01:30:50.200]   the consumers for credit card are generally not liable
[01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:53.640]   um for someone like ebay or any sort of retailer
[01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:58.040]   uh you know i have this for my site i have a membership program and i have
[01:30:58.040 --> 01:31:01.960]   uh you know i can choose the level of verification i want to accept a
[01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:06.520]   uh a credit card payment and it makes sense generally choose a lower one
[01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:10.520]   because you don't want to make an easy counter problems exactly and
[01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:15.240]   and that that pervades everything i mean
[01:31:15.240 --> 01:31:19.640]   it's and it's really i think realistically uh the target one is
[01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:22.840]   interesting i think it was actually really encouraging that the ceo lost
[01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:27.880]   his job because ideally that is providing a better incentive for other
[01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:30.600]   companies to do a better job with password security so you don't lose your
[01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:35.160]   job uh but i think that that realistically that's
[01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:37.800]   it's probably going to take something where there's
[01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:41.000]   just massive penalties associated with losing information
[01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:47.080]   because otherwise um it it's expensive it takes a lot of time it takes a lot of
[01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:50.360]   expertise and it's an unforgiving job that
[01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:55.560]   provides you zero benefit until like you can't prove a negative right you can't
[01:31:55.560 --> 01:31:59.080]   say oh this program is paying for itself because we haven't been having
[01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:01.960]   like how do you how do you how do you measure that and that
[01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:06.280]   when that's what makes it so hard to have companies realistically
[01:32:06.280 --> 01:32:11.480]   give it the resources it deserves once again you are speaking to
[01:32:11.480 --> 01:32:15.800]   intelligently for somebody who's up early in the morning in Taipei so stop it
[01:32:15.800 --> 01:32:20.680]   stop Taiwan well i just hit that point of lucidity where you've been up so long
[01:32:20.680 --> 01:32:27.560]   nothing but brilliance comes out of your mind it's so easy to to to say things
[01:32:27.560 --> 01:32:31.240]   like that they ought to take security more seriously but i you know like
[01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:35.000]   what does that mean yeah yeah everything was back to priorities and
[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:39.480]   and kind of incentives and until you kind of grok with those priorities and
[01:32:39.480 --> 01:32:41.960]   grokals incentives and why the pressure of where they are
[01:32:41.960 --> 01:32:45.880]   um it's just kind of a lot of you know a lot of hot air i should say that as
[01:32:45.880 --> 01:32:48.440]   someone else also has a podcast because that's what we make our living on that's
[01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:51.880]   what we live on that's why i'm going to give you a snack right now
[01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:57.400]   ben Thompson of stratecary a Santa Fe corn stick from my nature box this is a

[01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:25.880]   now the thing about the thing i like about nature box is these are there's no
[01:33:25.880 --> 01:33:29.160]   high fructose corn syrup there's no trans fats
[01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:32.840]   there's no artificial flavors nothing artificial at all
[01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:37.880]   uh no artificial colors it is delicious these are nutritionist
[01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:42.360]   designed treats you can get them delivered to your door
[01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:46.600]   every month they have three size boxes it's great for a family but great for
[01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:50.040]   business too we get we get like a dozen nature boxes a week i think
[01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:53.560]   because people love them and look at all the treats hundreds of delicious
[01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:56.600]   treats you can if you choose
[01:33:56.600 --> 01:34:01.000]   see my mouth's watering now narrow it down a savory sweeter spicy
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:05.480]   uh you can also choose special dietary needs like vegan soy free gluten
[01:34:05.480 --> 01:34:10.200]   conscious lactose nut free a non-gmo you all of them
[01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:13.000]   that would work with it i get the assortment of this grout i haven't even
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:16.280]   if you select all of them what would happen yeah
[01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:19.240]   is there anything well what i would suggest is get this first box we're
[01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:22.360]   gonna get you 50 off your first box when you use the off or go to it
[01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:25.880]   at naturebox.com/twit and what i would suggest is just
[01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:28.680]   unless you have a specific allergy or something get
[01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:32.760]   an assortment because speaking to which like uh you know my daughter two of my
[01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:36.040]   three daughters have food allergies uh in both two
[01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:40.680]   nuts and i just looked at their FAQ and it says here that uh it says here
[01:34:40.680 --> 01:34:43.560]   in just a few weeks you'll have the option of choosing the snacks the best
[01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:46.280]   fit your dietary needs and that you can write them
[01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:51.000]   at support@naturebox.com which i'll certainly be doing
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:54.200]   well this is not free is it true that that that that
[01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:56.760]   plantains are free of all those things that
[01:34:56.760 --> 01:35:00.920]   vegan vegetarian soy people can all eat
[01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:04.840]   that's right it's all the way it's all the plantains they want
[01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:09.400]   they don't like soy people there that's not this preferred nomenclature
[01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:13.080]   soy people should eat more plantains but just wait a minute go back up because
[01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:19.160]   Chad you see right there about this snack and it shows you in a very easy uh
[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:24.920]   logos what uh the ingredients are this is a nut-free snack for instance
[01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:29.400]   this is savory vegan low sodium this is really nice this really pays
[01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:31.640]   attention to the nutritional value of the snacks
[01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:34.680]   we have loved them they're all really delicious
[01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:38.600]   and uh Lisa is a big fan of the dried pineapples which are also nut-free
[01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:42.440]   uh and the best dried pineapples we've ever had the dried fruit on here is
[01:35:42.440 --> 01:35:45.640]   the best we've ever had this amazing take better than hairy
[01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:50.680]   shavings well that's a tough choice
[01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:54.680]   yeah but you wouldn't shave with everything bagel sticks that's the
[01:35:54.680 --> 01:35:58.840]   difference um anyway i just want you to check it out
[01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:03.640]   you will be very very happy with your nature box first one half off
[01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:08.120]   naturebox.com/twit use the offer code twit uh we've been very far oh by the way
[01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:13.160]   did you see that they also donate uh nature boxes
[01:36:13.160 --> 01:36:19.160]   and food to uh food banks around the country 150,000 meals have been donated
[01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:22.360]   to date by nature box. You know what i love Leo is that
[01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:27.240]   that kind of thing is is so and and forgive me for phrasing it this way
[01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:31.480]   it's it's so not extraordinary to donate and it's happening now look at
[01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:34.040]   nowadays you know what's going on? I think started with Tom's shoes right
[01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:36.280]   where they give a pair of shoes for every pair you buy
[01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:39.640]   Warby Parker does that with glasses with pair of glasses for every
[01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:44.360]   i think this is this is encourages me about uh corporate conscience that
[01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:48.040]   and maybe they're doing it for PR who knows but i feel like they're not i feel
[01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:50.520]   like the corporate corporations are starting to really care
[01:36:50.520 --> 01:36:53.960]   and want to give back and i think this is the best part Leo is even if they are
[01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:57.320]   doing it with service right exactly at the end of the day people are
[01:36:57.320 --> 01:37:02.040]   getting fed how good is that? and i hope that they're feeding them
[01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:04.520]   everything bagel sticks because they're really
[01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:07.720]   a bit you that taste better than the snacks the delta gives out on on the
[01:37:07.720 --> 01:37:13.000]   airplane airplanes airplanes wake up and smell the nature box please
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:17.480]   really oh that's brilliant why hand out those crappy snacks
[01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:21.400]   man because they're cheap wake up and smell the nature box
[01:37:21.400 --> 01:37:25.400]   hmm they're even in for the glass if you're lucky enough to be nutritious
[01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:29.400]   they're cheap we have a kid in the audience you want to just come here
[01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:34.120]   try a nature box just see does a this is good you in fact take
[01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:37.480]   take the whole do you like everything bagels sticks you think what's your name
[01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:41.400]   Ethan and where did your brothers and sisters go they just left
[01:37:41.400 --> 01:37:43.880]   oh they're there okay there you guys are from a
[01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:47.480]   Perth Australia so they don't have nature box in Perth
[01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:51.880]   so go ahead eat them and you don't have and and you'll know why america is the
[01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:56.440]   best country in the world this is why we want the cold war
[01:37:56.440 --> 01:37:58.920]   suckers
[01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:02.760]   you know actually having just come back from france where they actually have
[01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:06.840]   routinely you get good food you don't have to go out of your way i know
[01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:12.040]   it would be a solution box it's a terrible alternative nature box
[01:38:12.040 --> 01:38:15.720]   they have the right what is it the deluxe royale
[01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:19.720]   or a all the likes the royale with cheese
[01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:25.000]   ah do you order coffee and you actually get good coffee it's amazing
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:30.440]   it's amazing i love france and i talked about paper cup i mean you get a
[01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:36.120]   glass in a glass yeah we go to a coffee you know you know if you stand up at the
[01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:39.720]   coffee bar you pay less for your coffee than if you sit down if you
[01:38:39.720 --> 01:38:43.720]   it's it's a year of a cup of coffee if you stand but if you want to sit in a
[01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:47.240]   seat it's two and a half year old that seats expensive
[01:38:47.240 --> 01:38:49.800]   they're renting seats but you said good huh
[01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:53.800]   good huh yeah the whole family loves it mark nature box
[01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:59.400]   uh wwdc keynote coming up a week from monday june second it will be 10 a.m
[01:38:59.400 --> 01:39:06.040]   mark german who it just got out of junior high school apparently he's very young
[01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:09.080]   i i'm i'm reading this guy we quote this guy all the time he writes for nine and
[01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:12.760]   five mac has the best sources anywhere he is brilliant
[01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:17.480]   and i find out he's 20 years old i just feel like i can i i can't i can no
[01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:20.920]   worry it's scary i shouldn't be in this business
[01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:25.320]   it's a young man's game obviously here's what's wrong yo is soon it won't matter
[01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:30.520]   you you can be uh a mumra a decade old husk and it won't matter you'll be a
[01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:35.880]   vibrant youthful a when i welcome you to the plotage in brick patch
[01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:41.320]   job yeah i'm just 20 years old stop saying plot it's in brick that's i think
[01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:45.160]   you'll be fine there's your problem right there
[01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:49.080]   apple uh apparently according to mark german again the youngest man with the
[01:39:49.080 --> 01:39:53.480]   best connections ever says that he says there will be uh
[01:39:53.480 --> 01:39:57.880]   os 10 10 point 10 which is very confusing
[01:39:57.880 --> 01:40:02.840]   10 10 10 there will be ios 8 with new health book fitness tracking software
[01:40:02.840 --> 01:40:05.880]   improve maps new ipad features we don't know what they are
[01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:09.960]   are you snoring yeah i'm still going to keep there will be new hardware probably
[01:40:09.960 --> 01:40:15.640]   new mac books retina macbook airs anybody yes that's that's good i jump at that
[01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:18.280]   are you kidding me there's no rumors of any i watch
[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:23.000]   come there are rumors but i don't know
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:26.760]   hey dude do you think there's going to be any surprise i guess what the the two
[01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:32.120]   ways they could surprise us is if the rumors of a full resolution
[01:40:32.120 --> 01:40:36.440]   large format ipone turned out to be true some kind of curve but they want to
[01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:41.240]   announce that they want to announce that in june okay so so do you think there's
[01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:44.840]   a chance that an i watch or no no i think they're gonna announce that
[01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:47.960]   not even announce that this year i think it's a 20 think the retinot screen would
[01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:50.680]   do the battery life for the macbook here i think that's one of the reasons you
[01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:54.120]   might not see a macbook here with retina because they mean to me that's a lot of
[01:40:54.120 --> 01:40:57.960]   pixels the fact that i can go all the way across the atlantic on one battery
[01:40:57.960 --> 01:41:02.360]   with the macbook here yeah thirteen hours on the 13 inch it really changed my life
[01:41:02.360 --> 01:41:05.080]   you know because i go to conferences now i used to go and i would immediately
[01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:08.680]   look for a seat next to an electrical outlet right that was like my my biggest
[01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:12.520]   priority now i can go to a conference all day take notes go on
[01:41:12.520 --> 01:41:16.760]   wifi and not have to worry and and it's like you know it's an enabling
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:19.640]   technology it's not just an upgrade it's it's a
[01:41:19.640 --> 01:41:23.720]   substantial improvement in my lifestyle when i when i eat when i have to go on
[01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:27.320]   battery and and it's rare that you get any technology that you can
[01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:31.160]   make that statement about oh that's why i buy these by the dozen these are fake
[01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:36.360]   electrical outlet stickers and i just go around the airport and i uh
[01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:39.960]   i put those on all of it's great and then i wait that way you get the real one
[01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:43.080]   right right else goes after the fake right it's so fun to see everybody
[01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:45.560]   flocking
[01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:49.880]   five dollars and seventy five cents for a set of four kids
[01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:52.680]   but if you say you you could code card no no
[01:41:52.680 --> 01:41:57.480]   don't put code on that the the macbook air is a curious situation to me because
[01:41:57.480 --> 01:42:01.800]   when it was originally launched the macbook air was the highest most premium
[01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:05.240]   laptop out there right there is news stories about how they're so light and
[01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:07.880]   so ravy but they get stoned right because nobody
[01:42:07.880 --> 01:42:12.920]   realized but then they position it i mean apple positions the macbook air as
[01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:15.800]   their entry level version of the laptop right now
[01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:20.680]   so with that being the case why wouldn't you ruin the battery life on it why
[01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:23.960]   why i mean it's like there's no it's your entry level
[01:42:23.960 --> 01:42:27.800]   throwaway every college kid's gonna get a computer that seems like first of
[01:42:27.800 --> 01:42:30.680]   all exactly the brand that you'd want to flush down the toilet
[01:42:30.680 --> 01:42:34.920]   the 13 my my macbook air my 13 inch air i think cost me
[01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:37.320]   fourteen hundred bucks that's more expensive cheap one is
[01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:42.360]   11 inch and it only has eight ninety nine but that's still twice the price of a
[01:42:42.360 --> 01:42:45.960]   comparable you know in terms of specs and twice the price of a
[01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:50.120]   windows laptop so it's still not cheap it's just less expensive than the other
[01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:54.120]   mac i tell you one thing i know we will see and that's a 4k display
[01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:57.800]   uh the macbook uh pro with retina and the macbook
[01:42:57.800 --> 01:43:03.800]   i mean the mac pro support 4k displays apple has updated oh as 10 to support
[01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:06.600]   4k displays apple doesn't it's not a really smart
[01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:10.840]   display they've got to have a 4k display i i think it's a really smart move i think
[01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:14.680]   that by and large the entire nature of 4k uh has been
[01:43:14.680 --> 01:43:18.040]   mismanaged from the very beginning this is a whole technology where they're
[01:43:18.040 --> 01:43:21.720]   they're selling to the displays when literally nobody can tell the
[01:43:21.720 --> 01:43:25.240]   difference between 1080p and 4k when you go to the movie theater
[01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:29.400]   you're not even seeing 4k at the movie theater you're seeing 2k at the movie
[01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:32.200]   theater that's because you're 20 feet away from the screen
[01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:36.520]   correct correct but but if you want to do it right and this is what i think apple
[01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:40.280]   will do very smartly uh sell 4k based on the real estate for the
[01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:45.240]   screen like and i pointed this out before i'm looking at uh six monitors right now
[01:43:45.240 --> 01:43:50.520]   would much much much rather have one very large monitor that had enough room
[01:43:50.520 --> 01:43:53.720]   right to fit all of these individual things oh that's a good idea
[01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:56.840]   that's an interesting well i mean that's trivial i mean i think you could buy a
[01:43:56.840 --> 01:44:00.840]   4k display and do that now i think i actually disagree i think what apple
[01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:05.400]   apple will do this in the end of the retina which is high dp uh yeah yeah baking it
[01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:08.920]   you know that's dumb yeah i oh wait a minute i just i have a 4k
[01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:12.920]   display i got one of the only the two that have 60 hertz refresh rate there's
[01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:16.440]   an Asus and there's a sharp which apple sells they're insanely expensive they
[01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:20.600]   cost as much as the mac pro itself uh 2,500 bucks
[01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:25.400]   but i with 1093 they have i dpi so i run it at 1080p
[01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:29.720]   and it's the crispest thing i ever saw it's not real estate it's just beautiful
[01:44:29.720 --> 01:44:33.240]   because of the sub pixel rendering and then when i'm looking at an image or
[01:44:33.240 --> 01:44:37.480]   video then i get dot for dot and it's the best of both worlds you got to see it
[01:44:37.480 --> 01:44:42.200]   before you uh poo poo at brian it's really i would just say that in general what you
[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:47.080]   do is you get a modest increased infidelity and at a major major price and
[01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:49.880]   if you want to sell it's a ridiculous price premium yeah no i agree
[01:44:49.880 --> 01:44:53.960]   whereas if you're selling real estate you know it's it's quadruple the real estate
[01:44:53.960 --> 01:44:58.280]   it's four times larger than 1080p well you could do that like the most smarter we could do that
[01:44:58.280 --> 01:45:04.600]   if ces last year sony sony had a 1080p set right next to the 4k set and i was
[01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:08.840]   standing 10 feet from it watching their program that was a custom design to show
[01:45:08.840 --> 01:45:13.480]   off their 4k and i could barely tell the difference i mean it was it was
[01:45:13.480 --> 01:45:17.000]   a personal improvement uh it's nothing compared to the difference between
[01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:21.000]   standard definition and 1080p and so if they're going to sell it to watch movies
[01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:24.920]   then and they've got to come they've got to do something different so you know i agree
[01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:29.640]   with you uh as a computer screen yeah i can see it making sense but as a way of watching movie
[01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:35.160]   it's like if you're sitting right here if you are talking about content viewing
[01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:39.960]   uh subjective experience i heard some rumors a friend of mine is uh over at Warner Brothers
[01:45:39.960 --> 01:45:44.920]   and he talked about the experience of seeing a uh HDR display this is a whole new movement
[01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:48.840]   because everything you see on every display display you see every time they release something
[01:45:48.840 --> 01:45:54.200]   on blu ray they have to take you know our eyes see all the way to the brightness of the sun all
[01:45:54.200 --> 01:46:00.520]   the way to the darkness of you know candlelight and so on uh but our displays have an extremely narrow
[01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:06.440]   high end and low end of brightness on there and so he talked about displays that are being made
[01:46:06.440 --> 01:46:11.560]   that are intentionally crafted using different technologies so that they're so bright that you
[01:46:11.560 --> 01:46:16.920]   have to squint to look at them when something when the sun shows up you're physically in pain
[01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:21.960]   great uh he says this is so good from any other display you've seen why would i want that
[01:46:21.960 --> 01:46:28.920]   because because it feels like reality and that's it really doesn't and that 4k doesn't right
[01:46:28.920 --> 01:46:33.560]   so there's nothing there's nothing great about reality you know when it comes to losing your
[01:46:33.560 --> 01:46:40.360]   eyesight we will throw things that technology can improve on but what matters is if you want to
[01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:45.480]   motivate consumers the you have to be able to have your product look different from the other
[01:46:45.480 --> 01:46:49.640]   guys probably right i think that we've underscored the problem apple is going to have a week from
[01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:55.000]   monday is almost anything announces short of an i watch people are just going to say well so what
[01:46:55.400 --> 01:46:59.960]   that's why i was snoring right yeah well apple apple apple's been pretty successful with so
[01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:05.720]   what announcements um for for a lot of years now i think um well but doesn't it at some point don't
[01:47:05.720 --> 01:47:12.680]   you have to innovate i guess i got the back from seven they came out with the i the iphone yeah i
[01:47:12.680 --> 01:47:21.080]   mean the the reason why do people why do people love apple products it's usually i mean love not
[01:47:21.080 --> 01:47:26.360]   not like not like go go gaga oh it's the new thing not right headlines about apple why do people
[01:47:26.360 --> 01:47:32.840]   develop attachments to that it just works it's the refinement yes the it's the working all together
[01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:39.320]   and that that is very much innovation it's not headline writing innovation but it's doing the
[01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:44.280]   quote unquote snooze fest year after year but making it better and better and i i mean i think
[01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:49.000]   we we as an industry if you look at i mean if you look at tech in the very big picture you could
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:53.400]   arguably say there's only been four innovations in the history of tech period that being you know
[01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:59.000]   the mainframe the pc the internet and and the and the smartphone and everything inside of that has
[01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:03.960]   been has been a snooze fest i mean it all depends on your context i think we get so enamored with
[01:48:03.960 --> 01:48:09.480]   the headlines uh and you know it was you know i'm i'm gonna back i'm gonna back i'm gonna back
[01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:16.200]   yeah i'm gonna back bend up here and say that uh that that none of apple's home runs have been
[01:48:16.760 --> 01:48:22.360]   uh daring innovations they've all been extraordinarily safe bets that uh that everything around them
[01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:26.680]   you know it's like the the time they take risks is when you get something like a newton you know
[01:48:26.680 --> 01:48:32.040]   it's it's only after 20 years after the newton they get around and make it a an iPhone and they've
[01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:36.680]   never created it none of their successful products were they the first ones in the category i mean
[01:48:36.680 --> 01:48:41.160]   correct there were mp3 players before their ipod they were there were smartphones before the
[01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:46.600]   iPhone there were certainly tablets before the ipod what they did is simply refine them made
[01:48:46.600 --> 01:48:52.440]   them less complicated to use and managed to suddenly you know enter a market that existed
[01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:58.200]   and and excel at it which is you know what it is you see uh it's the virgin uh atlantic model
[01:48:58.200 --> 01:49:02.120]   you know virgin does the exact same thing all they do is take stuff that already exists and make
[01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:07.720]   it exquisitely awesome you know uh plane flight transatlantic plane flights were already around
[01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:13.320]   they just added massages and a bar to it you know that that's what that's what apple excels at
[01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:18.600]   are you gonna uh you know what you really need to do is get the new forty five thousand dollar
[01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:25.720]   sweet yeah did you see this uh what is the airline it's a it's a Abu Dhabi airline
[01:49:25.720 --> 01:49:33.160]   yeah at a height or eat a height yeah e t i h a d i think be used to eat on the plane well it's
[01:49:33.160 --> 01:49:38.840]   one of those uh three eighties or the you know the big air buses and actually there's a guy trying
[01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:45.800]   to raise money on kickstarter a travel a travel writer trying to raise money on kickstarter to buy
[01:49:45.800 --> 01:49:56.440]   this uh a passage on this uh it is let me see if i can find it here um it is a um uh three room
[01:49:56.440 --> 01:50:03.640]   suite on the airplane oh my god how many people can you bring in uh only two and it's forty five
[01:50:03.640 --> 01:50:08.520]   thousand dollars for a seven-hour flight for two people uh let me just compare it to private
[01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:13.720]   flying private it's probably a good deal they call it the residences on this plane the a 380
[01:50:13.720 --> 01:50:20.280]   uh you get a shower stall you get a living room and you get a bedroom and so wait a minute we're
[01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:26.040]   looking at this guy wants the guy who wants to ride that he wants to yes he needs he's trying
[01:50:26.040 --> 01:50:32.600]   to raise money he's a travel writer don't knock it he's got four hundred seventy six backers he's
[01:50:32.600 --> 01:50:36.760]   raised thirteen thousand dollars towards his twenty five thousand and this sounds like something
[01:50:36.760 --> 01:50:41.160]   like me and Justin would put together this seems ridiculous that he's actually trying to raise money
[01:50:41.160 --> 01:50:44.920]   for this wait till you see this thing though i'm gonna back it i think i've i've i've i've
[01:50:44.920 --> 01:50:49.480]   it's the first multi-room suite ever released on a commercial airplane
[01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:57.080]   uh yeah wouldn't you wouldn't you don't you want Evan Schlappig i'm sorry Ben Schlappig that's his
[01:50:57.080 --> 01:51:03.480]   name to Ben Schlappig to get to ride on this plane he's written on the problem the reason why i
[01:51:03.480 --> 01:51:06.840]   wouldn't spend it besides the fact that i don't have forty five thousand dollars to throw away no
[01:51:06.840 --> 01:51:11.400]   no you give them a buck that's all give them a buck no no i mean no in terms of this whole idea that
[01:51:11.400 --> 01:51:16.120]   the beauty of flying private occasionally i have the you know i have friends who have private
[01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:20.360]   planes occasionally i get to is that you don't have to go through security you just drive up to the
[01:51:20.360 --> 01:51:24.280]   point yeah you don't get that benefit no that's yeah i don't think you would get that benefit in
[01:51:24.280 --> 01:51:29.960]   this deal and so for me i mean forty two thousand maybe but forty five thousand probably the problem
[01:51:29.960 --> 01:51:34.200]   fly private is only would know if you could fly private without price i would think private
[01:51:34.200 --> 01:51:39.560]   private can't fly like transpacific like if this was if this was going like jusai pay for example i
[01:51:39.560 --> 01:51:43.800]   mean i'm gonna go to san francisco next week you would love this wouldn't you 12 or flight yeah i
[01:51:43.800 --> 01:51:49.320]   think in that case that's where that's why i'm the most i mean i'm kind of an air travel geek um
[01:51:49.320 --> 01:51:53.880]   well we've got the perfect person here yeah we're no i don't know that much about it but i the
[01:51:53.880 --> 01:51:58.920]   thing that surprises me the most about this product is it's on such a short route um a seven
[01:51:58.920 --> 01:52:03.800]   hour round yeah right where it is actually competing with private aircraft so you go up the stairs
[01:52:03.800 --> 01:52:09.080]   to your private that this is just first class don't get excited okay now we're gonna
[01:52:09.080 --> 01:52:18.840]   the door closes the tv comes on you relax the what are those eglot coolers what are those those
[01:52:18.840 --> 01:52:24.520]   those open up and you could put your shoes in there and then here's your shower your private
[01:52:24.520 --> 01:52:29.720]   shower walk through there and i don't know what else is in here oh here's your bed well look at
[01:52:29.720 --> 01:52:34.440]   that oh yeah double bed of course yeah lots of room and i'm still stuck on this for the
[01:52:34.440 --> 01:52:39.640]   mile-hundred-hundred thing yeah it's like you know what leo i'm sorry announcing right now i'm
[01:52:39.640 --> 01:52:45.000]   gonna record a webcam video of myself that i'll post on go fund me to raise enough money to make
[01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:50.920]   a decent indiegogo video that all will raise me even more money for a kickstarter video to go
[01:52:50.920 --> 01:52:54.920]   for a ride on this that's what i'm gonna do there you go bootstrap it's all about bootstrapping
[01:52:54.920 --> 01:52:58.920]   as a result we're right i mean we talked about marketing i mean like how many people on there's
[01:52:58.920 --> 01:53:03.880]   so new and ed ahead are airways it's good for ed ahead it's good for bench lapping uh it will
[01:53:03.880 --> 01:53:11.720]   operate from Abu Dhabi to london he throws starting december 2014 and there i i want to give the
[01:53:11.720 --> 01:53:17.960]   guy some money just because of his hot spa speaking of hot spa i don't know which is the
[01:53:17.960 --> 01:53:24.520]   word for that particular route but that's okay hi look at her i'm here and you are in your residence
[01:53:24.520 --> 01:53:31.320]   come have dinner she seems awfully perky uh she happens to be playing her because i don't think
[01:53:31.320 --> 01:53:37.880]   they want to be traveling by private jet the residents by etihad has a v-i residence and they
[01:53:37.880 --> 01:53:44.040]   will organize everything for you from a luxury limousine private check in and lounge and when
[01:53:44.040 --> 01:53:51.400]   you arrive on i see you will be greeted by your butt plop you get a butler buttler get out of here
[01:53:51.400 --> 01:53:58.440]   you just lost me whatever one thing it's time we're thinking maybe there are people who can
[01:53:58.440 --> 01:54:02.520]   afford this you know in that in that in that particular route i mean yeah give us great
[01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:07.480]   nobody's paying for this everybody's using this is the kind of thing you set up so that people can
[01:54:07.480 --> 01:54:11.800]   waste their stupid airline miles on it nobody actually pays for actually the best thing is i don't
[01:54:11.800 --> 01:54:17.560]   believe it my suggestion next time bring a 12 year old try to get on the get him on the exit row
[01:54:17.560 --> 01:54:21.480]   they're gonna come up to you and say you're sorry you can't sit here sir let's say all right i'll
[01:54:21.480 --> 01:54:25.960]   take the residence and then and then and then put down holy cow that's a brilliant idea
[01:54:25.960 --> 01:54:32.600]   i am mad last story stuff right i know last story of the day i am mad senator
[01:54:33.560 --> 01:54:44.600]   uh lay patrick leihy of vermont was single-handedly with a tweet killed patent reform in the senate
[01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:54.440]   dead the patent trolls have won congress what what yes what uh the house representatives had
[01:54:54.440 --> 01:55:01.080]   overwhelmingly approved pat reform in december was sent to the senate the chairman of the senate
[01:55:01.080 --> 01:55:02.920]   judiciary community patrick leihy
[01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:09.560]   tweeted uh yeah we're not going to do this we don't have the votes never mind
[01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:15.560]   julie uh sam uh samison who is julie samuels who was the former eff
[01:55:15.560 --> 01:55:20.120]   uh lawyer uh is a director of engine a group that lobbies for startups
[01:55:20.120 --> 01:55:25.320]   said uh tuesday night it was moving forward wednesday morning it was moving forward then i looked at
[01:55:25.320 --> 01:55:32.200]   twitter there was a tweet saying it was dead what the hell uh really a surprise wait
[01:55:32.200 --> 01:55:35.640]   now if not like leihy was trying to kill the bill i'm just reading a little more
[01:55:35.640 --> 01:55:39.640]   middle-eighy with leihy was leihy decided because he's the chairman of the committee
[01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:45.720]   to table it he you little laterally did it but i don't think he did it because he hates the idea
[01:55:45.720 --> 01:55:48.840]   but i think he did it because he didn't have the votes to make to get it to pass if i'm reading
[01:55:48.840 --> 01:55:53.640]   this right well and that's a question he said we don't have the votes right i would have liked
[01:55:53.640 --> 01:55:59.160]   it to have gone a little farther in the process to see that the the r-stechanical you just showed
[01:55:59.160 --> 01:56:04.840]   is interesting because that's contending that it was actually killed by harry reed um and the
[01:56:04.840 --> 01:56:12.680]   under pressure from the the trial lawyers and yeah the pharmaceutical industry yeah um i think uh
[01:56:12.680 --> 01:56:16.680]   which which would be unfortunate i i wonder if there's uh
[01:56:16.680 --> 01:56:22.360]   the pharmaceutical industry i think is under is certainly understandable although they tried to
[01:56:22.360 --> 01:56:27.320]   accommodate them i mean that that's kind of like the poster child for why patents are necessary
[01:56:27.320 --> 01:56:30.680]   yeah we need patents nobody's saying that what we don't want is software patents or we don't
[01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:35.720]   want is non-practicing entities to go around suing people because it's a good way to make money
[01:56:35.720 --> 01:56:42.280]   right because the writer says the leihy did not say he was giving up on the bill and
[01:56:42.280 --> 01:56:47.640]   noted he still thought to address the problem of patent jul. Next year yeah so yeah i mean okay
[01:56:47.640 --> 01:56:53.240]   first of all yeah i guess i'll step up i'll be doubles advocate here uh like if he didn't have
[01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:58.840]   the votes what's so wrong about saying i don't have the votes you know like like that's just a fact
[01:56:58.840 --> 01:57:04.680]   i assume right i don't think the leihy's not the bad right here that's the issue the contention
[01:57:04.680 --> 01:57:09.560]   it was killed you never got out of committee my lobbying groups yeah right and remember this past
[01:57:09.560 --> 01:57:15.640]   the house representatives by an overwhelming margin um it was supported by the president uh and
[01:57:16.120 --> 01:57:21.560]   the leadership the leadership starting at harry reid killed it uh right and democrats killed it
[01:57:21.560 --> 01:57:27.480]   lee reid and leihy uh killed it um yeah the arts technica article said that leihy was just doing
[01:57:27.480 --> 01:57:34.680]   harry reid's bit bidding harry's of course the uh majority leader i do wonder i do wonder i if
[01:57:34.680 --> 01:57:41.960]   there would if there'd be some way to get traction um in explicitly i don't know if i don't know if
[01:57:41.960 --> 01:57:46.920]   this is possible but to explicitly split off software from the rest of the patent system that
[01:57:46.920 --> 01:57:51.720]   may be the solution because then uh but you know who makes money on these lawsuits really it's the
[01:57:51.720 --> 01:57:56.760]   patent it's the lawyers that's who the lawyers 29 billion dollars last year and almost all of it
[01:57:56.760 --> 01:58:03.080]   went to lawyers uh who yeah it's a it's a very you talk about incentives and and like right it's
[01:58:03.080 --> 01:58:08.040]   actually a very understandable approach all they got to do is take 10 percent give it to congress
[01:58:08.040 --> 01:58:13.080]   and uh everything's fine it's very disappointing very disappointing i'll tell you what whenever we
[01:58:13.080 --> 01:58:17.400]   run across something like this i just wish i just want to hear kori doctor ove talk about it because
[01:58:17.400 --> 01:58:21.560]   i remember listening on this week in tech like it must have been three years ago greatest seasoning
[01:58:21.560 --> 01:58:26.120]   i mean where were you talked about the whole idea of piracy as as an intellectual venture and
[01:58:26.120 --> 01:58:31.560]   and uh uh in the 1700s and the whole reason we have patent laws it is right now it's like
[01:58:31.560 --> 01:58:36.520]   i just i just know in my mental rolodex i know that i'm dumb about this and i want to hear somebody
[01:58:36.520 --> 01:58:42.200]   smarter i will get kori on soon the problem with kori is in britain and unlike benny's not
[01:58:42.200 --> 01:58:46.600]   willing to get up early or no i think it's the other way around it's uh bedtime for posing yeah
[01:58:46.600 --> 01:58:50.920]   the problem with the problem with the problem with patents is i think everyone it's the same just a
[01:58:50.920 --> 01:58:57.320]   tired thing to get in a bigger knot or bow uh it's a similar thing to to the surface thing like we
[01:58:57.320 --> 01:59:04.680]   forgot the whole reason they exist right right the reason they exist is is the the the people who
[01:59:04.680 --> 01:59:08.920]   help the idea of patents and and go back to the founding fathers and whatnot like everyone knows
[01:59:08.920 --> 01:59:15.880]   patents are a bad thing they reduce competition they make things more expensive uh the reason they
[01:59:15.880 --> 01:59:23.480]   exist is that uh they are an artificial monopoly and the reason they exist is the fear that if they
[01:59:23.480 --> 01:59:28.360]   didn't exist some types of innovation would would not happen and again the pharmaceutical is a great
[01:59:28.360 --> 01:59:32.760]   example it takes something like seven or eight years to bring something to market and they're
[01:59:32.760 --> 01:59:39.240]   trivial to copy if there weren't patent protection there would be no point in investing in no we need
[01:59:39.240 --> 01:59:44.200]   pet seven or eight years that's clear but with the problems in in software and technology like
[01:59:44.200 --> 01:59:49.080]   there is no need for additional competitive advantage there's such an advantage to being
[01:59:49.080 --> 01:59:53.960]   first to market right uh the whole reason that patents exist in the first place doesn't even
[01:59:53.960 --> 02:00:00.600]   apply to technology and that that's but it's almost i i wonder if we would get traction by
[02:00:00.600 --> 02:00:05.400]   going back to first first principles like what's the point of patents okay now we all agree that's
[02:00:05.400 --> 02:00:12.920]   the point then it becomes just super obvious that they don't have a place in software in particular
[02:00:12.920 --> 02:00:18.200]   beyond the fact that you know software's math then you can't pop patent math but well i felt like we
[02:00:18.200 --> 02:00:21.240]   were i felt like we were getting there and i felt like this bill was one of the ways we were
[02:00:21.240 --> 02:00:25.560]   gonna get there but that's dead cori doctor oh by the way to answer your question brian brushford
[02:00:25.560 --> 02:00:33.000]   suggests the magnificent seven model for fighting patent roles go on it's actually kind of like
[02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:39.880]   your model he says uh the remember in magnificent seven the villagers who are plagued by bandits
[02:00:39.880 --> 02:00:44.280]   every year to sign instead of giving money to the bandits let's give it to mercenaries to fight
[02:00:44.280 --> 02:00:50.440]   the bandits the magnificent seven seven seven samurai in the original uh he says what we need
[02:00:50.440 --> 02:00:55.960]   to do is we need to get a kickstarter together and have all the money that you put into defend
[02:00:55.960 --> 02:01:00.680]   against pat pat and trolls get that together on a kickstarter and then we're gonna hire i don't
[02:01:00.680 --> 02:01:05.400]   know clinton eastwood you'll bring her uh steve mccwayne and james coburn and they will come and
[02:01:05.400 --> 02:01:10.760]   take care of the pat and trolls essentially like create a super fund a super fund right actually
[02:01:10.760 --> 02:01:15.960]   can i just point you as long as we're talking about it may one this is to me the long-term
[02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:23.480]   solution for the whole thing that larry lessigs may one campaign may one dot us kickstart fundamental
[02:01:23.480 --> 02:01:28.360]   reform by reducing the influence of money in politics he's raised 1.1 million dollars to create
[02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:34.760]   a super pack to end all super packs and i think it's exactly the right solution larry you remember
[02:01:34.760 --> 02:01:39.880]   with a guy who created creative commons he's been on this show many times and he finally realized
[02:01:39.880 --> 02:01:45.720]   he's never going to win in anything unless we get the money out of congress and uh by creating a
[02:01:45.720 --> 02:01:51.320]   super pack that would then elect people who would then change you know camp pine finance reform
[02:01:51.320 --> 02:01:57.240]   we could finally maybe do something but it's 1.153 million dollars doesn't sound like a lot
[02:01:57.240 --> 02:02:02.680]   but no congress is cheaper than you think i think that's the really interesting thing in all of
[02:02:02.680 --> 02:02:08.680]   this it doesn't take a lot of money so stage two launches next month keep them a metum going if
[02:02:08.680 --> 02:02:17.640]   you want to know more may one m a y o n e dot u s we are at a time thank you everybody it's been

[02:03:42.040 --> 02:03:48.440]   the main one we the last episode was about you know takin politics and um we got to fix this
[02:03:48.440 --> 02:03:53.160]   yeah really a great site and then if you get a membership to the site you've got you doing
[02:03:53.160 --> 02:03:55.960]   some interesting stuff you've got a private glass board which is a great idea
[02:03:56.760 --> 02:04:02.600]   um and uh meetups and all sorts of stuff so i won't say china anymore but but but you speak
[02:04:02.600 --> 02:04:07.960]   chinese there don't you yes you have chow mane you have egg foo young
[02:04:07.960 --> 02:04:13.160]   i'm making you stop right now those are all like western
[02:04:13.160 --> 02:04:18.280]   constructs i know i know i i was in chinese vanger i know all of that stuff but he has stuff in
[02:04:18.280 --> 02:04:23.720]   your face with your fortune you have guy bow you have charsel bow you have all the good bows i know
[02:04:23.720 --> 02:04:30.120]   it's good food you're talking uh it's just not that china it's another china it's the other china
[02:04:30.120 --> 02:04:34.600]   uh no no i mean it's actually it's a great place for food because there's oh yeah there's
[02:04:34.600 --> 02:04:37.880]   the different parts of china but there are uh the japanese actually
[02:04:37.880 --> 02:04:42.680]   uh controlled the island for the first 50 years of the 20th century and so there's a heavy japanese
[02:04:42.680 --> 02:04:49.480]   influence um in the europeans we heard before so it's actually a really interesting um mix uh and
[02:04:49.480 --> 02:04:54.520]   from a culinary perspective it's it's excellent one one of the one of the many advantages of a
