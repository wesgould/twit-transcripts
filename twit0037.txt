[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   This week in time.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   This is Twit, this week in tech, episode 37 for January 8th, 2005 CES.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   [Music]
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   And we're on Skype because we're all over the place.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   John C. Devorak, who never left home, is here from his home in Northern California.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   He's the virtual CES columnist.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   Kevin Rose and David Prager both went to Las Vegas, but you guys are home now?
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   Yes.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Oh, that's good.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   And so the one remaining fella who is still in Vegas, in fact, he's right now
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   winning his way to the McCarran Field, the airport, and as soon as he gets there,
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   he's going to get on Skype and join us is Patrick Norton, who was down there doing
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   a number of episodes, I think three episodes of his show for as if David's digital life.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   He's going to be on the airport Wi-Fi?
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   Yeah, we'll see how that works.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   So David, do you and Kevin do a system down there or any, or a dignity or any, any
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   things?
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   So we went there and we did a live recording of "Dig Nation" from the Central Hall on the broadcast.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Oh, come on, not from slots of fun?
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   No, what if slots of fun would have been cool.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   And then actually we got another big thing going on right now.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   We had Han Choi and Injuha and Dain Mazota and a few other people out there working to put together a special on CES called "Indigital Your Life in Gear."
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   That's the name right now.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   It's kind of a little pilot episode of what we think might turn into a product show.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   But that's exciting.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Yeah, a lot of really good news.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Yeah, that's really excited about it.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   And so a lot of the folks that did "Fresh Gear" and then actually a couple of the folks that did some of the filter stuff at G4, at least some of the producers and stuff.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Are they all gone from G4?
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   To the best of my knowledge, yes.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   I know that like there's no lab, there's no lab of any kind at G4.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   So you just basically hired the lab?
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Well, I don't know if we didn't hire them or didn't hire them yet.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Hire them.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Hire's kind of a fancy word.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Hire is what will happen when we start paying them, when we ultimately monetize the whole thing.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Basically everybody here is working for free too.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Han Choi has actually done a lot of work.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   He put a lot of work in to help him organize this stuff.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   That's neat.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Well, so once again, more old tech TV guys join the phone.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   And that'll go live on Tuesday the 10th.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Tuesday the 10th, you can download it.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Check it out.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   That's great.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   So that's your CES coverage.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   And is that that was also from CES or?
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   That was from CES and we'll put that up on revision3.com.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   John C. Devorek had an interesting idea.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Neither John or I went to Vegas.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   I just didn't go because I'm lazy.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   But John actually is trying something out.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   You're doing a virtual CES?
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Yeah, I gave up on the idea of going to CES.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   And I'll tell you why.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   There's over 6,500 analysts and media people.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   They are covering 2,500 booths.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Oh, I mean, it's like over covered.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   And so I put up a metasight instead, which is basically I went and looked at all the people
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   that are linking to CES or that have news about CES, which includes PC magazines,
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   if Davis, ZeeDeeNet, PCWorld, NGajitGizmodo.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   And you go to my site, Devorek.org/CES, and you'll find it.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   And that's essentially as far as I'm concerned.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   You can get the whole show that way.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   And in fact, it's very well covered if you take a look at those particular sites.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   And Gajit did an amazing job.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   I felt like I saw it.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   They had booth tours.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   They had live coverage of the keynotes.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   And they had an analysis.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   I thought they did as good a job as certainly a better job than I would have been.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Yeah, no, that's the way I see it.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   But there's something else about these shows that are over covered like this,
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   which I'm thinking is great for guys like Gary Shapiro and the CES folks.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   But the fact of the matter is even if you remember back during the tech TV days,
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   they would take and put their entire budget into going down to CES,
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   which is already over covered.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   We spent a million dollars one year.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   I can't remember if it was Comdex or CES.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   It was CES.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   A million bucks.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Right.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   They spent a million dollars.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Meanwhile, you have to remember there's 900 shows a year in the United States
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   that have to do with computer technology.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Really?
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Meanwhile, tech TV puts a million bucks in this and they won't spend 10 cents
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   on sending anybody to any of the other shows where there's a lot of good stuff.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   I mean, there's not everybody with 2,500 booths.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   You know this.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   I mean, these are just the guys who can afford to go to CES and exhibit.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   Most of the really cool stuff is someplace else and you have to get out.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   Next Fest, South by Southwest, demo.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   Those are much more interesting, frankly, than anything CES does.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Well, demo, I have an issue.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   What would you have done with a million dollars, Kevin and David?
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   I mean, you could go for years.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   You could do a thousand systems for that.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Well, the problem with this show is like you guys are saying,
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   it's just so big now and you're bombarded with like flat screen TVs.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   It's like now there's a 700-inch flat screen LCD.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Right.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   It's just the web is really the way to do it.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   I mean, everyone else is doing it so well.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   I mean, at least--
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   So why'd you go?
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Well, we went to shoot "Dignation" there.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   They were going to give us a free little spot on the showroom floor to shoot it.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   We met up with a bunch of fans that came out.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   So that was a lot of fun.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Well, and-- but to look at products, I actually skipped the entire floor.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   I went to Dolby to see some of my friends there and other than that,
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   I just took off and I've just turned to the web to find all the links and reviews.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   So even though you were there, you didn't even--
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   It was a madhouse.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   I mean, it is just like, it's craziness.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   I can't even tell you how packed it was.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Like, there was-- you get stuck in these little hallways and they kind of try and shuffle you through
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   and then you're just like sitting there for like five minutes going,
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   "How am I going to get out of this?"
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   It's pretty crazy.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   You know, I'm not saying at any point that these shows should be over with
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   and we should do everything on the internet because then that wouldn't work at all.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   You do need these shows.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   There are people that need to go to CES and those people tend to be salesmen
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   who have to like do deals and they have to meet, you know, a lot of clients during a very short period of time.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   And I think it's very effective for that.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   But for people who go and look for new products at this particular show,
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   I think it's futile.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   In fact, I was getting press releases during the show at my house here.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   And these press releases, if I was actually at the show,
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   I wouldn't have been able to respond to any of these things because that had been too busy
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   and then there's a lot of distractions.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   But John, if you don't need these shows, why did Condex fold if you need these shows?
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   I mean, it wasn't that one point of Condex, was the dealers meet the vendors?
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Well, I mean, yeah, that's what the key to the success of these shows.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   And then you do need these shows for that kind of thing where,
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   but again, it's mostly salespeople that need to have these kinds of meetings.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   So why did Condex fold?
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   I think well, Condex folded for a number of reasons.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   For one thing, they lost their focus.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   They went to, they kind of gave up on the idea that the show was about computers
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   and it became like an enterprise business show.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   I mean, this idea that you're going to start appealing to the enterprise people
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   who never go to anything.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   But what's the focus of CES?
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   I mean, there's no focus at all.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   It's consumer electronics.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Yeah, but that's everything.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   I know it's something that's...
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   I think it wanted to be everything.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   Well, I think CES doesn't want to be everything.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   I've talked to Shapiro about this and he's not that pleased with the...
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   I mean, he's not carping about the money, but he's not pleased with the fact that they have to absorb Comdex.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   I would like to see him spin it off the computer show.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   They almost did it this year with that, with the event at the Sands,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   which was the innovation pavilion.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   And there's no reason that they can't actually literally recreate Comdex
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   and just spin it off and not have this mix that they have now.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   That's the one place I wanted to go to the Sands innovation pavilion.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   That's the place I didn't get to go.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   That's what I really was really interested in seeing.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   I don't know what you heard about it or what was it.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   Well, I mean, I got pictures on the web.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   I don't know what it was like.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   I was like, it was fantastic.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   David and Kevin were there and saw nothing.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   You know what the worst thing was about Comdex for the journalists?
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   The worst thing?
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   See, what?
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   I'm glad you did that because I was going to do that any minute now.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   The absolute worst thing was the media bags.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   It's always kind of cool to get a nice little sat.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   I love those.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Oh, they're terrible.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   It's the crappiest little roller backpack you have ever seen.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   They had a pretty good bag a couple years ago.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Yeah, I had the great one.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   That was the main reason I went.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Yeah, I go to get the bag.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   This one is a Tachiba bags.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Tachiba bags.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   You know what it was?
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   It's because of the number, the sheer number of media that were there.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   The share of bags.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   You know, 6,500 bags for all these people.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   It's just like, that's a lot of those things cost like $10.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   That's like $65,000 worth of bags for a bunch of bone.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   And you know what's funny?
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   Here's what's really, really funny because this is one of the big news things that see us.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   Inside of the bag, though, is put things that people pay for.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   Well, inside of this bag is something from the Blu-ray group, Blu-ray group,
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   and also inside the bag is something from the HD DVD group.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   And those are some of the only things in the bag.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   It's ridiculous.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   Hey, that was one thing I was surprised.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   Did anybody see a combined HD Blu-ray DVD playback unit?
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   I don't think there was.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   There wasn't that.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   I mean, Broadcom announced a chip that'll do both at the same time on the same chip.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   But that's an issue because consumers are not going to buy two iDef DVD players.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   They're not going to buy one until this gets settled.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   It's not going to get settled.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   This is going to be the...
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   This is truly, and I've always like poo-pooed the idea that everything is VHS beta, you know, revisited.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   This really is.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   I think it is too.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   This really, this is boneheaded.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   And we were...
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   You know, I wish Robert Herron were here.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   He's also on route.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   He can't get back in time.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   But this was one thing Robert said from the beginning, "Oh, no, don't worry.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   There'll be dual format players, but there aren't."
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   You know, the dual format, if you talk to either one of these groups,
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   they'll tell you it's going to cost a lot of money to make a dual one.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   Because these two technologies are not that compatible.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   The other thing, you know, sitting from a distance, the other thing I noticed was there was no really big news.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   What was the big news of CES this year?
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Kevin?
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   Well, that big story.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   What about Vista?
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Did you hear that funny video about Vista?
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   No.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Oh, I guess they were showing up.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   You'll get your...
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   You'll get your...
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   You'll get your...
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   You'll just kind of try to flog it.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   That was a big...
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   I mean, you didn't have anything to say in his keynote.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   That was a big story in the keynote.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Apparently Larry Page gave a keynote that was maybe one of the worst in history, I'm told.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   Was that about Google Pack?
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Yeah, but probably a bit more complicated.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   But wait a minute.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   Robin Williams, it doesn't matter how bad the keynote was.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   15 minutes of Robin Williams redeems anything, doesn't it?
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   I saw it?
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Did you neither of you guys saw it?
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   I saw it as part of the stream.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   It was so boring that I turned it off.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   Well, as soon as I knew that Larry Page was doing it, I thought it might not be that good,
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   because half the time that Google has one of their co-founders in the media,
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   it's Sergey Brin, who's supposed to be the amicable guy, the guy who's good at talking.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   And as soon as you hear that Larry Page is giving the speech, at least from what I've heard
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   people say, "Hey, Sergey Brin is totally the voice, then why wouldn't they have the guy who's more than that?"
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   Neither one is exactly a pistol.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   We've had them both on the screen savers, and they're not exactly dynamic.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   But who cares?
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   They're scientists.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   They're not.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   Who cares?
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   They're rich.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   They're rich.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   The Google Pack, what's your take on that?
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   I think it's a clever marketing scheme to bundle all of their crap together.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   They couldn't figure out a way to get you to install Google Desktop or some of their other stuff.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   And so they said, "Hey, we're going to make this pack that has everything all in one."
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   But it's missing a word processor.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   Well, it's not supposed to be.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   It's just a bunch of...
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   I think you picked the word exactly right, Kevin.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   It's a box of crap.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   It is.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   It's just a box of crap.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   And then they throw in trial versions of Norton Antivirus.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   That's like...
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   I need that.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   The other thing is, I have installed that Google Desktop search thing three or four times
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.600]   on every time I've had to take it off the system because it just steals cycles and it stalls
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:51.600]   the machine.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.600]   They all do.
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.600]   They all do.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.600]   This is a dixing.
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.600]   Yeah, but geez.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.600]   I mean, there's got to be a smarter way of doing it.
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.600]   This pack...
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:00.600]   I mean, look at the software that's in there.
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:01.600]   It's so confusing.
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:04.000]   We're going to give you the Google toolbar for Internet Explorer.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.640]   And you also get Firefox with the Google toolbar.
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.600]   And who wants real player, please?
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:11.600]   Who...
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:12.600]   What is real in there too, really?
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:14.500]   It's an optional install.
[00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:18.000]   The good news is, the best thing of it, by the way, was the installer.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.720]   I really like the installer because it was very small, quick download.
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.200]   You could choose what you're going to install.
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:25.200]   It resumed.
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:27.560]   It downloads and then installs and then you can resume it.
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:28.560]   It has auto updating.
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.560]   I mean, that was the thing they should do more of.
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:32.760]   Give more of that stuff away.
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:34.800]   But yeah, the real player is one of the options.
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:38.480]   I mean, Norton Antivirus and Real Player 2 are the worst things you could put on a desktop
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.480]   computer.
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:40.920]   And who doesn't have Adobe Reader?
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:41.920]   Come on.
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:42.920]   Yeah.
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.160]   I don't get it.
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:45.160]   So that's the big announcement.
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.900]   Hey, hey, by the way, has anybody noticed that I had Adobe...
[00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.700]   That thing, by the way, is getting worse with age.
[00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:52.700]   But I had...
[00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:58.180]   They wanted to upgrade to Adobe 7 and it kept coming up saying, "Here's Adobe 7 and here's
[00:12:58.180 --> 00:12:59.180]   the Yahoo!
[00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:00.180]   Toolbars."
[00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:01.180]   Anyone seen this?
[00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:02.180]   Yes.
[00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:03.180]   And it won't let you not take the Yahoo!
[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:04.180]   Toolbar.
[00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:05.180]   I don't want the Yahoo!
[00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:06.180]   Toolbar ever.
[00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:07.220]   We're in a bad era.
[00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:08.580]   This is a bad era.
[00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:09.580]   Everything.
[00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:12.820]   And somebody pointed out, and I think this is true, that Google's real business...
[00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:14.460]   We're finally seeing is not search.
[00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.960]   Google's business is to get AdSense everywhere.
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.320]   I think it was Jason Collicanis who said this.
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:20.320]   That's their business.
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.880]   Put ads everywhere.
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:23.760]   And that's what the pack is all about.
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:28.560]   Just how many Google ads can we stick on your desktop?
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.400]   All ads all the time.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:35.600]   Now, was anybody surprised that they didn't announce a Google PC with the Google OS?
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.600]   That was...
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:37.600]   I wasn't surprised.
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:38.600]   There wasn't an "i" buzz.
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.240]   I don't see there being a Google OS for a long time.
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.640]   I mean, who would run Google OS?
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:47.980]   I mean, seriously, the first thing they would have to do is go hire or at least steal some
[00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:51.000]   of the Apple design guys, because if it's anything, then Google creates it's going to
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.780]   be ugly as all hell.
[00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:53.780]   They're great.
[00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:57.580]   I love their search engine, but they have no idea when it comes to a sense of design.
[00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:59.900]   I mean, I would not be running the Google OS.
[00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:04.300]   I mean, one of the reasons why most people, at least that are kind of in my demographic,
[00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:09.540]   run certain operating systems is because they'd love to customize it and it looks pretty.
[00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:10.940]   I can't see that coming out of Google.
[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:12.780]   Anything good coming out of Google there.
[00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:14.540]   So this was the keynote that everybody was waiting.
[00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:16.740]   I mean, they put it on Friday for some reason.
[00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:18.060]   Everybody was saying, "Well, this is going to be good."
[00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:19.740]   Bill Gates started out with nothing, right?
[00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.540]   I mean, Justin Timberlake, he brings on.
[00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:22.540]   Oh boy.
[00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:26.020]   This is his idea of a hot commodity.
[00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:31.180]   He shows Vista and says, "Yes, sometime next year, sometime later this year."
[00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:35.940]   And they announced what some deal with MTV to do music and some deal with DirecTV.
[00:14:35.940 --> 00:14:37.620]   Nothing, basically.
[00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:41.060]   I don't understand why they take these keynotes.
[00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:43.660]   Why don't get some real heavy hitters?
[00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:49.020]   I mean, I guess string would be qualified, but I'm sick of listening to these same old
[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:51.460]   speeches that are just nothing but promoting their own product.
[00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:52.460]   I mean, this is not a...
[00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:53.740]   Well, you think Bill Gates is a heavy hitter?
[00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:54.740]   There's no vision here.
[00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:55.740]   Yeah.
[00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:56.740]   Well, that's...
[00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:58.060]   Bill Gates announced this was the digital decade.
[00:14:58.060 --> 00:15:00.300]   Hey, good news.
[00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:01.300]   Here we are, 2006.
[00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.340]   He's figured this out.
[00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:07.340]   Have you guys seen the video that came out from CES about the product manager that was
[00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:10.660]   describing Vista and how they overlaid the video of OS X?
[00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.660]   Oh, it was awesome.
[00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:14.660]   It's going around the web right now.
[00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:17.820]   Basically, what they had this product manager saying, "Look at those transparent windows
[00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:19.420]   that you can see on top of each other."
[00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:22.580]   And here, you look at it in the toolbar, you can actually see video playing and they're
[00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:27.940]   showing OS X doing this right now as the Microsoft product manager is talking about it.
[00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:28.940]   It's hilarious.
[00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:31.260]   That's kind of the knock on Vista as it's just a rip off of OS X.
[00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:32.260]   Oh, it's a copycat.
[00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.940]   They just stole everything from OS X.
[00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:35.940]   Widgets, everything.
[00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:39.580]   Again, Apple stole widgets from Confetti.
[00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:41.660]   Yeah, what goes around comes around, I suppose.
[00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:47.260]   But how about Paul Odellini, the Intel CEO who brought on...
[00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:48.660]   He wasn't...
[00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:53.420]   He brought on Tom Hanks, Tom Cruise, Danny DeVino.
[00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:56.300]   This was a star fest and still nothing.
[00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:58.100]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:01.380]   You know, there's something wrong when they have to bring all these guys out just to...
[00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:02.380]   Oh, yeah.
[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:06.220]   Some of the women instead.
[00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.180]   I think it'd be better for this audience.
[00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:10.220]   Who wants to see Tom Cruise?
[00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:12.220]   Yeah, well, Tom apparently saved the demo.
[00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:14.140]   I guess they were showing a demo of...
[00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:15.140]   They were trying to show...
[00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:16.140]   Oh, no, this was...
[00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:17.140]   Was this Yahoo?
[00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:18.140]   Maybe it was Yahoo.
[00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:19.140]   I think it was Terry Semmel who...
[00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:20.140]   Right, right, right.
[00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:21.140]   Yeah, it was Yahoo.
[00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:28.300]   They were trying to show a streaming video of Tom Cruise's movie and it wouldn't play.
[00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:31.820]   So the cruise comes out and saves him and plays it.
[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:32.820]   That's really pathetic.
[00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:35.300]   All right, so come on, there must have been a big announcement.
[00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:36.740]   How about that Sony e-reader?
[00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.220]   Are you excited about that?
[00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:40.380]   You know, Patrick Norton seemed to be...
[00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:42.660]   I looked at it and I didn't think much of it.
[00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:43.660]   What's the point?
[00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:45.660]   Patrick's wanted one of these lead bays for a while.
[00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:46.900]   This is essentially what it is.
[00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:47.900]   Did you...
[00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:49.820]   When you were in Japan, Kevin, did you see a lead braid?
[00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:50.820]   The little Sony e-reader...
[00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:53.300]   No, you know, Phil Tron had one.
[00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:57.740]   I saw up in San Francisco a few weeks ago, but I had not seen it in Japan.
[00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:59.100]   And what did you think of it?
[00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:00.100]   It was cool.
[00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:01.100]   It was a cool little device.
[00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:02.100]   It's essentially what this...
[00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:05.860]   I think that's essentially what this new Sony e-reader is.
[00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:07.020]   And the idea is what they say...
[00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:08.900]   They don't give the battery life in terms of hours.
[00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:09.900]   They give it a number of books.
[00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:14.340]   I don't know how they get that, but they say a 15-book battery life.
[00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:16.540]   I hate the way they say there's so many songs in your pocket.
[00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:17.540]   I don't know.
[00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:18.540]   They just say how big the darn thing is.
[00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:19.540]   Tell me the hours.
[00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:20.540]   How fast do I read?
[00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:21.540]   Do you know how fast I read?
[00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:23.820]   Tell me how many hours is it going to be?
[00:17:23.820 --> 00:17:26.820]   And it's a very crisp display according to people who've seen it.
[00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:27.820]   But it's three dollars.
[00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:28.820]   It's also a hundred bucks.
[00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:29.820]   Yeah, 400 bucks.
[00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:31.740]   Isn't it just more of this?
[00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:35.660]   These things, only a number of people out there have warmed up to these readers.
[00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:37.940]   I just don't seem to be becoming successful.
[00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:40.740]   No, Steve Gibson is the only guy I know.
[00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:42.980]   And he uses a palm.
[00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:43.980]   And he...
[00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:44.980]   Norton likes the idea.
[00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:45.980]   Well, Norton likes the idea.
[00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:48.380]   Let's see if Norton likes the actual thing.
[00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:51.460]   He'll probably get it and then complain.
[00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:53.380]   You'll hear it here first.
[00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:55.940]   Maybe on DLTV then you'll hear it here.
[00:17:55.940 --> 00:17:57.780]   Kevin's got the trio coming in the mail.
[00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:58.780]   Do you think Kevin...
[00:17:58.780 --> 00:17:59.780]   Do you order that?
[00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:02.580]   I'm going to say 700.
[00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:05.420]   I have the 600, I have the 650 and...
[00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:06.420]   You're going to like the 650.
[00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:07.420]   You're doing it back.
[00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:08.420]   You're doing it back.
[00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:10.700]   You know, I think it's the palm OS thing.
[00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:11.700]   I don't know what it is.
[00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:14.060]   It's just like I really don't see...
[00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:15.420]   I just didn't really like it.
[00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:17.060]   It didn't work for me.
[00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:20.260]   So now hopefully with all these Windows CE apps I'll be able to find something I can
[00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:21.260]   actually do with it.
[00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.860]   This is for some reason a product from Palm Running Windows Mobile.
[00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:24.860]   Right.
[00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:28.540]   The first reviews are fairly negative by the way.
[00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:29.540]   What did they say?
[00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:33.060]   Well I heard I had a good digital camera which my razor right now does not.
[00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:34.060]   That'll be nice.
[00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:37.500]   I think a camera is the most important part of your phone.
[00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:38.500]   In video mode.
[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:42.500]   That's kind of one of the way you're taking pictures of it.
[00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.700]   So one of the things that came up...
[00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:49.020]   I don't know if it was at CES but it came out during CES which is Acesus coming up with
[00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:54.540]   a Lamborghini notebook to compete I guess with the Acer Ferrari notebook.
[00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:56.100]   The Ferrari notebook is beautiful.
[00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:57.100]   Oh it is.
[00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:00.540]   The Lamborghini one is pretty too but it's black.
[00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:01.540]   It's really shiny.
[00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:03.860]   You see them every once in a while.
[00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:04.860]   Someone will have one.
[00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:05.860]   They're pretty cool.
[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:07.980]   The thing I really like is the Ferrari mouse.
[00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:10.340]   I've been trying to get one of those.
[00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:11.980]   Well it's a beautiful paint job.
[00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:12.980]   I mean that's what it is.
[00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:14.980]   It's a paint job with a Ferrari logo on it.
[00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:17.420]   I presume the Lamborghini is the same thing.
[00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:19.420]   They must think somebody wants them.
[00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:23.300]   They're showed a beautiful painted red cake.
[00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:27.240]   It's these case mods of I guess trickle down or else they're looking at these shows and
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.620]   figuring in a monster garage.
[00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:29.700]   Well somebody must want these.
[00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:31.220]   I don't know what's going on.
[00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:33.500]   If you want a case mod wouldn't you do it yourself?
[00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:34.500]   Why would you go to Dell?
[00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:36.220]   Well it's pretty hard to do with laptops.
[00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:37.220]   Yeah that's true.
[00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:38.700]   Although you can just paint the thing.
[00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:40.980]   I mean these things you put some stickers on it.
[00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:43.620]   I mean it's not like they're immune to that.
[00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:48.860]   I think it's probably a limited market but it's sexy and it tracks eyeballs.
[00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:56.900]   It seems like CES for all the noise and sound and fury was really not particularly interesting.
[00:19:56.900 --> 00:20:01.580]   You know one thing that they announced but I don't think they were at CES was the Optimus
[00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:05.220]   keyboard is going to be out on February 1st.
[00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:07.420]   You're going to be able to purchase the Optimus keyboard.
[00:20:07.420 --> 00:20:08.580]   What's the Optimus keyboard?
[00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:09.820]   I just sent you a link.
[00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:10.820]   Check it out.
[00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:11.820]   Oh you did.
[00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:16.300]   It's the most amazing OLED keyboard where the back you've seen pictures of this before.
[00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:17.300]   Hold on.
[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:19.300]   I've watched something.
[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:20.300]   Hold on.
[00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:21.300]   I know what happened.
[00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:22.300]   There it is.
[00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:23.300]   There it is.
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:24.300]   There you go.
[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:25.300]   Prager you've seen this.
[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:26.300]   I've watched something.
[00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:27.300]   Hold on.
[00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:28.300]   I know.
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:29.300]   There it is.
[00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:31.300]   I know what happened.
[00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:32.300]   Terrible.
[00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:39.260]   You know I have this Firefox extension that opens all the windows that I had opened before
[00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:43.060]   and it's something gone wrong with it and it now opens all the windows I've ever had
[00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:44.060]   opened.
[00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:45.060]   Wait a minute.
[00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:46.060]   Wait a minute.
[00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:47.060]   Okay.
[00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:48.060]   Could you hear that?
[00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:49.060]   Did you hear that music?
[00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:50.500]   Is that the session saver?
[00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:51.500]   Yeah.
[00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:52.500]   Session saver.
[00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:55.940]   But it goes, well one machine it works fine but it goes crazy on this machine and it opens
[00:20:55.940 --> 00:20:58.460]   like it just opened 20 or 30 windows.
[00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:02.940]   Anyway I got another product that came out at the show which is kind of a baffling one.
[00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:09.780]   Has anyone noticed that the $399 Kodak camera with the two lenses and two CCD image sensors?
[00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:10.780]   And why two?
[00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:11.780]   What's the deal on that?
[00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:12.780]   I have no idea.
[00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:14.500]   Two is better than one.
[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:19.340]   One lens handles 23 millimeter and the other one's a 3x optical zoom.
[00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:20.340]   So it's a wide angle.
[00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:22.340]   A macro or something like that.
[00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:26.300]   That's a wide super wide angle plus a little zoom and I guess you flip it or you choose
[00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:27.300]   one or the other.
[00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:28.300]   I just think it's crazy.
[00:21:28.300 --> 00:21:32.500]   I mean they are CCD so cheap now that you can just throw a second one into the camera.
[00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:34.740]   Well this Optimus keyboard is gorgeous.
[00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:35.740]   Wow.
[00:21:35.740 --> 00:21:36.740]   How much is it?
[00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:37.740]   Did you get that John?
[00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:38.740]   I sent it to you too.
[00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:40.300]   It's got little LEDs.
[00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:41.300]   What is it?
[00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:42.300]   What is it?
[00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:43.300]   It's got little LED.
[00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:46.020]   Every single little button you can put your own disc.
[00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:48.140]   I mean it's like every single little button is like a little display.
[00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:52.540]   But I don't know what's so it looks ridiculously awesome and it's super cool but like is it
[00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:53.540]   really?
[00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:55.100]   But is it really that bit?
[00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:56.900]   Does it really going to improve anything that you do?
[00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:00.580]   Well what if you use multiple languages?
[00:22:00.580 --> 00:22:01.580]   I guess.
[00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:03.940]   But what are the reasons I don't think so is FI.
[00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:04.940]   Good for gaming.
[00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:08.460]   There's a lot of like say video editors that say they use Final Cut that love the little
[00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:11.820]   editor keyboard but once they get using it they don't care about the buttons.
[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:13.340]   They don't look at the case.
[00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:14.340]   Who is it really mad?
[00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:15.340]   But here's the question.
[00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:16.940]   How much is this going to be?
[00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:17.940]   It's $100.
[00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:18.940]   $100.
[00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:19.940]   No.
[00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:21.980]   See also one of five.
[00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:23.540]   There's no $100.
[00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:26.820]   This is with that many OLEDs is going to be $1000.
[00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:28.700]   You know what this is like that guy.
[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:29.700]   This is like the Shlomo guy.
[00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:30.700]   Well these are cheap.
[00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:31.700]   Are they?
[00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:32.700]   Well I mean they're supposed to be.
[00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:33.700]   That's the reason that they're all.
[00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:34.700]   A hundred made of them?
[00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:36.140]   Well they're all little dinky ones.
[00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:38.700]   It's probably just one big one cut up.
[00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:39.700]   Wow.
[00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:43.580]   Well they say it's coming out in February.
[00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:47.220]   I don't think we'll see it in February.
[00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:48.220]   I don't think we'll see it.
[00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:49.220]   Do you think June?
[00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:51.060]   June you think we'll see it?
[00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:52.060]   I love the idea.
[00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:54.620]   Yeah you know I'm just going to guess at the product price.
[00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:57.660]   I'm going to guess because this is the price point where it's going to start to have the
[00:22:57.660 --> 00:22:59.420]   minister returns his $249.
[00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:01.060]   Yeah it'd be around that.
[00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:02.660]   I'm thinking $199.
[00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:04.340]   $199 what it should be.
[00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:05.820]   $199 it'll sell a lot.
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:06.820]   $350.
[00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:07.820]   I'd buy it at $199.
[00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:08.820]   $350 you'll die.
[00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:15.100]   Yeah isn't it funny how finally you have to calibrate that kind of stuff.
[00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:17.940]   Let's see if there's prices in some of the reviews.
[00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:19.900]   I'm going to click through some of them.
[00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:21.540]   Nobody says a price.
[00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:22.980]   I would buy this.
[00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:23.980]   Oh $200.
[00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:26.860]   Wait a minute.
[00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:32.180]   The keyboard is as a prototype the cost of making it is $200.
[00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:35.500]   That would mean the retail price would be $600 to $800.
[00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:38.780]   You got to do a 3x of cost apart.
[00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:43.940]   Of course that's a bag of parts and numbers if it costs a lot to manufacture.
[00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:45.100]   We made it a lot more.
[00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:48.300]   But it's whatever the case is it sounds like it's not affordable.
[00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:50.300]   What's the cost of parts for the Xbox 360?
[00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:52.900]   That's more than that.
[00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:57.340]   But the problem with the game business is that they sell the boxes at a loss.
[00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:58.340]   I know.
[00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:01.140]   You can't sell software for a keyboard.
[00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:02.940]   There's no way to make the money back.
[00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:05.620]   It's a one-shot deal.
[00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:13.780]   Did you guys go see the guy who, what's his name, is selling the two-terabyte compact flash
[00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:15.860]   drives?
[00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:17.620]   It's the Adam Computer Guy?
[00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:19.380]   Oh, I've seen links for that.
[00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:20.860]   I never thought it was bogus.
[00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:21.940]   Well, I think it is bogus.
[00:24:21.940 --> 00:24:23.820]   But he was showing it's CES.
[00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:27.460]   Well, that's funny because I blogged that when he first announced it.
[00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:28.460]   The Adam Computer?
[00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:29.460]   Yes.
[00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:30.460]   Yeah.
[00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:31.460]   That would probably be something.
[00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:33.700]   If I had gone to the show I would have tried to track it down.
[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:35.580]   I don't know what anybody saw this.
[00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:37.020]   I mean, did he really have a booth?
[00:24:37.020 --> 00:24:41.660]   Yeah, and Gadget has pictures of the booth.
[00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:45.340]   The size of a compact flash, and he's got labels on him that say one terabyte and two
[00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:46.340]   terabytes.
[00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:47.340]   They are solid state.
[00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:48.340]   They're this noose, whatever, this quad.
[00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:50.140]   And it's USB 2.
[00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:51.140]   No, no, no.
[00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:52.140]   It's got to look.
[00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:54.500]   He's actually got them in computers.
[00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:55.500]   Replacing the hard drive.
[00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:59.300]   So you can have a two-terabyte, solid state hard drive.
[00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:03.140]   So you have to trick your computer into thinking it's being connected through some kind of
[00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:04.140]   IDE.
[00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:05.140]   He's got an IDE interface.
[00:25:05.140 --> 00:25:07.060]   S-A-C-A or something?
[00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:08.060]   Yeah.
[00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:10.700]   The whole thing is bogus, clearly bogus.
[00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:11.700]   But who knows?
[00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:12.700]   I mean, I don't want to lie bull the guy.
[00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:13.700]   Maybe it isn't.
[00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:16.700]   But has anybody ever used any of these, John?
[00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:20.140]   I mean, this is not the first thing he's come out with.
[00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:26.420]   No, in fact, I can't find that blog reference, but I'll try to get it.
[00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:27.420]   It'll be on the--
[00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:28.420]   You wrote about it in your blog?
[00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:32.460]   I wrote about it when it first was announced, or when I first saw pictures of it, which
[00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:34.780]   was about six months ago, maybe longer.
[00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:36.340]   People were skeptical then.
[00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:42.540]   Well, if you start to research this fellow and his previous partners, you could do that
[00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:43.540]   on Google.
[00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:46.100]   You'll find some very interesting things that he goes back.
[00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:49.380]   He's like a Russian guy or something like Bulgaria or something like that.
[00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:53.060]   He's kind of like a mad scientist type.
[00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:55.100]   I can't remember the details, unfortunately.
[00:25:55.100 --> 00:25:56.580]   I'm trying to get up.
[00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:59.140]   I'm desperately going through and gadget seeing if I can find it.
[00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:01.140]   All I remember is the atom computer.
[00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:07.820]   He's using some sort of quantum mechanics to get huge amounts of data in very small
[00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:08.820]   spaces.
[00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:12.500]   What I don't understand is if he can't do it, what's the percentage of spending the
[00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:16.460]   money fake in all this?
[00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:22.580]   Doesn't it seem like he must be able to come up with something if he's showing it?
[00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:23.580]   Here's the reference.
[00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:27.420]   Unfortunately, I lost the images, which I think I took from his site, and I just linked
[00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:28.420]   to him deep-linked.
[00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:31.100]   It was done on 9/7/2005.
[00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:35.140]   They went to my blog and they go to 9/7 and they find it on there.
[00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:36.940]   The atom chip corporation.
[00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:40.340]   He's a little right up there.
[00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:44.140]   There's a picture of the metal genden.
[00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:51.300]   There's a picture on his site of the metals that he's won.
[00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:55.860]   The whole thing is if it's a scam, it's an interesting scam.
[00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:59.980]   It's hard to believe that it's possible.
[00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:02.380]   Where would this come from?
[00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:05.300]   Well, who knows?
[00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:08.220]   Maybe it's deep Russian.
[00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:13.860]   The atom chip corporation, you can go to the website atomchip.com and you can see his
[00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:19.260]   6.8 GHz CPU, two terabytes of quantum storage.
[00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:23.260]   Yeah, a bunch of patents and a bunch of awards.
[00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:27.380]   That sounds to be more vapor-worthy than that phantom gaming console.
[00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:29.420]   That's what people are comparing it to, is the fan.
[00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:33.660]   It seems to be that he really likes awards.
[00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:36.820]   If you Google Shimon Genlin, you find a Vorex article, actually.
[00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:38.620]   I'll put that in the show notes.
[00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:43.980]   You're interested in these dual core centrino notebooks?
[00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:46.300]   Yeah, Apple.
[00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:47.300]   That's the thing.
[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:51.100]   To me, CES felt so dull.
[00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:55.260]   Maybe it's because in comparison to what we hope will come out next week from Apple, maybe
[00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:58.140]   it's just that this is the opening act.
[00:27:58.140 --> 00:27:59.620]   That's what I'm more interested in.
[00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:04.140]   Speaking about Engadget, their big rumor anyway, or that's where I read it first, was
[00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:08.340]   they're coming out with 42-inch and 50-inch displays that have built-in computer.
[00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:09.340]   I don't know.
[00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:10.820]   What do you think about that?
[00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:12.740]   This came from one guy's blog.
[00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:17.380]   Actually, it's a funny blog because he talks about how he found out about this in a convenience
[00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:18.380]   store.
[00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:24.140]   The convenience store clerks, that kind of friend told him this story, which obviously
[00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:29.940]   he's from a Grady's Power page.
[00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:31.100]   I find this hard to believe.
[00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:32.100]   John, what do you think?
[00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:37.300]   First of all, this is the kind of thing you'd announce at CES, not at Mac World Expo.
[00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:38.300]   It's an HDTV.
[00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:42.540]   Basically, it's a media center with a Mac in it.
[00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:50.860]   I think that kind of bounced me about some of these initiatives kind of surrounds my
[00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:55.060]   fulfillment over Vive, which is, I thought they were going to do a whole-
[00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:57.420]   Well, I'm sure this would have a Vive chip in it.
[00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:59.460]   Yeah, I would, I guess.
[00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:00.460]   I don't know.
[00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:06.660]   I think there's been no real move that I've seen from the consumers to really want this
[00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:07.660]   kind of thing.
[00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:11.380]   There's a lot of nerds that really like a lot of geeks that think it's cool, but generally
[00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:14.780]   speaking, these have to be mass market items, and I'm not seeing any, I'm not seeing a
[00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:15.780]   trend here.
[00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:19.580]   Nobody wants a Colonel Panic or a blue screen of death on their television set.
[00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:22.940]   You know, and that was one of the things that was good about Tivo.
[00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:24.780]   It was pretty reliable.
[00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:25.780]   It felt like a alliance.
[00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:28.100]   It was because of those legs.
[00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:31.660]   So Apple's big announcement is going to be the notebooks with the Intel-based--
[00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:32.660]   I think so.
[00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:34.740]   That will suck because I just bought a PowerBook.
[00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:35.740]   Yeah, I heard that.
[00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:36.740]   What were you thinking?
[00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:38.500]   Well, you know, they updated the screens.
[00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:42.700]   They did a new resolution screen on the PowerBooks recently and within like the last what?
[00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:43.700]   Four or five months?
[00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:44.700]   Real high res too, huh?
[00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:48.700]   Yeah, so I thought, you know, they're not going to release anything new, hopefully.
[00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:52.620]   That's what they're trying to hope you'll say, you know?
[00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:56.580]   I would be convinced this was happening only if Leo had just bought a PowerBook.
[00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:58.140]   Yes, exactly.
[00:29:58.140 --> 00:29:59.700]   I'm holding off.
[00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:04.460]   I really do believe, in fact, I've told everybody I know that now, you know, if the
[00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:07.620]   last couple of months have been the time to wait, don't buy a Mac now, you know, wait
[00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:09.340]   and see what they announced Tuesday.
[00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:13.060]   I think they're going to go-- they might do something in the form of some type of media
[00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:16.340]   center because, you know, if you play with Frontrode all, you know, it's even you guys
[00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:17.340]   need to get to cool.
[00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:18.340]   Yeah, love Frontrode.
[00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:19.340]   It's really cool.
[00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:22.500]   It just needs a few more features, a little PVR functionality, and it would be a really
[00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:23.500]   cool device.
[00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:24.740]   Well, that's a speculation.
[00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:29.300]   They'll build a Vive-based Mac Mini with Frontrode on it.
[00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:32.460]   You know, the new iMacs come with Frontrode and a remote control.
[00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:34.980]   You press the button and it comes up.
[00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:37.660]   Much nicer looking than a Microsoft Media Center edition.
[00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:40.820]   It really, you know, has little rotating icons.
[00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:44.500]   You pick your music or your videos or your DVD or your--
[00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:47.900]   Has anyone played with Myth TV?
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:50.260]   A lot of this comes from, I think, that initiative.
[00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:55.060]   The problem is, is that Myth TV, which has all this functionality, you know, you put
[00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:58.500]   in a little box and put it over by your television set and use it.
[00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:01.860]   Because it's plug-in driven, you can actually put all kinds of cool features on there.
[00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:05.060]   I know Apple will not never have, which is things that will allow you to--
[00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:06.060]   Like, bittorn.
[00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:07.060]   --like, bittorn.
[00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:08.060]   --or bittorn.
[00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:09.060]   Right, and you put bittorn on.
[00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:10.220]   You can do all these cool things.
[00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:13.500]   And, you know, that's pretty much the way people really want to go.
[00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:14.500]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:17.740]   I mean, if you're going-- that's what speaking to you what you said originally, which is,
[00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:18.740]   this is a geek market.
[00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:21.220]   This is not a general market, and that's what geeks want to do.
[00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:26.740]   Yeah, but then again, you know, you give me a Mac Mini that you can plug into your TV,
[00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:30.220]   you know, with a cable card slot in the back, and then you plug directly DVI into the back
[00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:34.460]   of your TV, have a little remote for it, 100 gigabyte hard drive internally.
[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:35.460]   I don't know.
[00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:38.140]   That could be a little TV killer right there.
[00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:41.700]   How many cable companies are offering or allowing you to use cable card?
[00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:42.700]   TV killer.
[00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:43.700]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:44.700]   Hold on a second.
[00:31:44.700 --> 00:31:45.700]   TV killer.
[00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:46.700]   TV killer is dead.
[00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:47.700]   That's easy to kill him.
[00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:48.700]   TV killer.
[00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:49.700]   It doesn't take long.
[00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:51.940]   I'm talking about the PVR industry as a whole.
[00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:52.940]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:56.140]   It's a-- he meant to say it's a killer PVR, which is what it is.
[00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:57.140]   I'm just giving them a little.
[00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:59.460]   I don't know if TV was completely dead.
[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:01.660]   I mean, there's stocks at $5 a share.
[00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:05.020]   Did you hear what Jim Denny said recently?
[00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:06.020]   Yeah.
[00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:07.020]   What?
[00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:08.020]   Jim Denny is like their big marketing guy.
[00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:11.980]   He says, "It's been my opinion that the DVR is sort of a stepping stone technology,
[00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:14.020]   more of a feature than an actual product."
[00:32:14.020 --> 00:32:17.780]   He said, "Really, the feature is internet delivered content, not recording and watching
[00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:18.780]   it later."
[00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:20.620]   So that was the smartest thing out of T-Ville I've heard in a long time.
[00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:21.620]   I agree.
[00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:22.620]   Well, they're making those moves.
[00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:23.620]   They've got the deal with Yahoo.
[00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:25.180]   I mean, I think that makes sense.
[00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:27.900]   They need to deal with Netflix is what they need to deal with.
[00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:30.540]   Everybody needs to partner with them so I can don't have to wait for my movies to come
[00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:31.540]   down.
[00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:32.540]   They are.
[00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:33.540]   They have a deal with Netflix.
[00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:34.540]   Oh, well, there you go.
[00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:35.860]   Hey, here's an interesting question.
[00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:38.740]   You must have noticed the Google video announcement.
[00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:42.460]   Does this intrigue you, Kevin, particularly?
[00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:46.340]   What they're going to do is start offering CBS is going to offer shows without commercials.
[00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:48.620]   NBA is going to offer games the day after.
[00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:49.940]   You'll be able to download them.
[00:32:49.940 --> 00:32:50.940]   Now here's the thing I like.
[00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:54.140]   You have a choice of whether include copy protection or not.
[00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:55.740]   Obviously, CBS and NBA will.
[00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:59.020]   Others like Charlie Rose are not going to.
[00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:04.540]   You can also set the price unlike Apple where everything's 99 cents for music, a buck 99
[00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:05.540]   for video.
[00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:07.460]   You could set the price and you're still paying for your own bandwidth.
[00:33:07.460 --> 00:33:08.980]   If you put your stuff up there, right?
[00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:09.980]   No, no.
[00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:10.980]   Google hosts it.
[00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:11.980]   Yeah.
[00:33:11.980 --> 00:33:13.620]   Oh, so that's how much or what you can do in iTunes.
[00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:14.620]   Yeah.
[00:33:14.620 --> 00:33:17.060]   So how much are they going to pay you to watch Charlie Rose?
[00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:19.580]   Have you ever been on Charlie Rose?
[00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:21.380]   You seem like the type that he'd like to have on him.
[00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:22.380]   Now he likes Markoff.
[00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:23.380]   Oh, he said Markoff.
[00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:24.380]   All right.
[00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:27.660]   I don't understand what the big deal is about the NBA thing.
[00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:30.260]   If anything is worth watching live, it's freaking sports.
[00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:34.100]   You don't want to watch a basketball game that has to do.
[00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:35.100]   I don't know.
[00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:36.860]   I think Charlie Rose I would buy.
[00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:38.420]   Probably not some CBS shows.
[00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:43.540]   But what you know, here is an opportunity to sell system or dignity video.
[00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:47.940]   You can sell it for 99 cents and you don't have to put in copy protection.
[00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:49.980]   I think Google might have a handle on this.
[00:33:49.980 --> 00:33:51.020]   By the way, they're only taking.
[00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:55.780]   I think now I heard one person say 20%, another say 30%, but they're taking a much smaller
[00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:57.260]   cut than Apple takes.
[00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:00.340]   What's the deal with how Google is re-compressing the video?
[00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:01.340]   Because right now.
[00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:02.340]   Oh, it's awful.
[00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:03.340]   It's terrible.
[00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:04.340]   Everything.
[00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:07.220]   Every single system episode that we've posted on there or our dignity.
[00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:09.740]   It just they just, I mean, it's related to death.
[00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:10.980]   It's 20K a second or something.
[00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:12.180]   Well, I think they're very low bandwidth.
[00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:16.860]   But I think that this, they say downloads here and I'm hoping that that means they're
[00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:18.660]   going to have full quality downloads.
[00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:19.660]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:23.700]   I think you're not going to put it, you know, you're not going to see, you know, everybody
[00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:25.940]   loves Raymond pixelated at 20 kilobits.
[00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:26.940]   I mean, that's ridiculous.
[00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:28.340]   Well, you know, I've been doing that already.
[00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:33.300]   I actually, I've been watching the show The Office, which is the US version is also very
[00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:34.300]   good.
[00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:37.580]   And I missed an episode of it and I went on the iTunes music store and they had it the
[00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:41.900]   next day or the day after or two days after and I was able to buy it for Buck 99 and I
[00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:44.940]   had it the quality that I want and downloaded it right then and there.
[00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:47.540]   I thought you used, I thought you used BitTorrent Kevin.
[00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:49.380]   You know, no, here's the deal.
[00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:50.380]   Hold on.
[00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:51.380]   It's like, I got to write this down.
[00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:54.660]   What was the date today that somebody actually bought a copy of The Office?
[00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:56.660]   Let me get this.
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:35:02.740]   I bought, I bought desperate housewives lost and surface the entire seasons.
[00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:04.660]   Yeah, you see, that's, that's the whole thing.
[00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:05.660]   It's easy.
[00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:09.780]   Yeah, it's easy and I know the quality is going to be remaining the same throughout
[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:10.780]   all the different episodes.
[00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:11.780]   I want to collect it.
[00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:13.140]   So that's my way of collecting these episodes.
[00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:15.620]   If I get it off mid-torn, it's going to be all chopped up.
[00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:16.620]   It might be an X fit.
[00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:17.780]   It might be an H264.
[00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:18.780]   Who knows?
[00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:21.580]   That's the best way I get it in one unified package that I can keep forever.
[00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:23.940]   David, move your mic a little away from your nose.
[00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:24.940]   It sounds yikes.
[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:25.940]   A windstorm.
[00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:26.940]   Is that better?
[00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:27.940]   Yes.
[00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:28.940]   Yeah.
[00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:30.500]   I, I, you know, it's funny.
[00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:34.700]   I agree with you because even though the quality is not that good on iTunes, at least
[00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:37.420]   it's acceptable, you know, I wish it were a little bit better.
[00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:40.620]   I mean, you could buy the DVD in a year and it'll be a good quality.
[00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:44.140]   Well, see, the problem with the premium, premium content and when I say premium, I
[00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:48.060]   mean like ABC, CBS stuff is if you want to get ABC stuff, you got to go to iTunes and
[00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:52.180]   now if you want to get CBS stuff, you got to go to Google and like right now, you know,
[00:35:52.180 --> 00:35:55.940]   the average consumer, all they have to do is plug in to direct TV or Comcast or whoever
[00:35:55.940 --> 00:36:00.380]   and they can get it all through their DVR, not subscribe to a bunch of different stuff.
[00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:04.260]   Isn't, isn't CBS somebody is going to put shows up the day before?
[00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:05.860]   Well, I don't know.
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:06.860]   That's pretty cool.
[00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:07.860]   Nancy, I like that.
[00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:08.860]   Yeah.
[00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:09.860]   Would you pay enough money?
[00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:12.860]   Oh, who cares whether you see it the day before a week later?
[00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:13.860]   I'll tell you one thing.
[00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:16.260]   I would like to see the day before is the Super Bowl.
[00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:17.260]   That would be cool.
[00:36:17.260 --> 00:36:19.660]   Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:24.700]   Well, I understand with the new quantum technologies built into Adam computers, you can.
[00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:26.660]   Yes, you can.
[00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:29.540]   You can see it next year's games this year.
[00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:30.540]   It's an amazing thing.
[00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:33.540]   The one problem I have to say with Apple though right now is they don't have a way
[00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:37.700]   for you to take that video that you just purchased and easily kick it out to your TV.
[00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:41.140]   You know, my power because it's video out, but you know, it's just all names.
[00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:46.740]   If you have an iPod with video, you just buy it at a V core, that's what I do.
[00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:47.740]   That's another iPod.
[00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:50.100]   How much did that core cost you, Leo?
[00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:51.580]   I think it's expensive.
[00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:53.100]   I think it's 30 bucks.
[00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:55.340]   It's a ripoff too because it really is.
[00:36:55.340 --> 00:37:00.420]   It could just be the standard multimedia cord, which I have three or four, but no, I tried
[00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:01.420]   those.
[00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:02.420]   It's not.
[00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:05.700]   They've wired it slightly differently, so you have to buy an Apple AV cord.
[00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:09.140]   I'm hoping you guys are enamored with this stuff.
[00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:10.140]   Yeah, not so.
[00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:12.060]   Sorry, I'm just saying I'm just critical here.
[00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:13.060]   Yeah, I don't.
[00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:14.060]   I agree with you.
[00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:16.660]   What we're really going to need though is what I'm hoping is coming out with Mac
[00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:21.380]   World is a updated airport express that you can stream your video right to your TV.
[00:37:21.380 --> 00:37:23.580]   Yeah, that would solve it, wouldn't it?
[00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:24.580]   Yeah.
[00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:27.180]   And those are low enough quality.
[00:37:27.180 --> 00:37:28.020]   The file size is low enough.
[00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:31.180]   I think they'd stream very well over even over B.
[00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:34.300]   Well, even if it was high quality, right?
[00:37:34.300 --> 00:37:37.060]   I mean, even if you have 10 mgs or eight mgs, that's going to be, you know.
[00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:38.660]   Yeah, but yeah, let's say you had six megabits.
[00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:39.660]   Yeah, yeah, you're right.
[00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:40.660]   Yeah.
[00:37:40.660 --> 00:37:42.020]   Anything but HD.
[00:37:42.020 --> 00:37:46.620]   These new Centrino notebooks, they've got the new wireless on theirs is AB and G.
[00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:52.180]   I wonder why they added A, which seemed to have been kind of the bundle chip because
[00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:55.300]   they could and you it's one one better.
[00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:58.140]   It's got three, not not two.
[00:37:58.140 --> 00:38:01.140]   Did you hear about Nvidia's quad SLI?
[00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:02.340]   Wait a minute.
[00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:03.340]   I hear a ring.
[00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:04.820]   Yeah, let's talk about that in a second.
[00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:07.300]   John's got an SLI machine, but Patrick's calling here.
[00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:09.060]   Let me let me pick him up.
[00:38:09.060 --> 00:38:11.260]   Hey, Patrick, you're in the airport.
[00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:12.260]   I'm at the caron.
[00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:13.260]   Yeah.
[00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:14.260]   What were you laughing about?
[00:38:14.260 --> 00:38:16.260]   This is why he's in the background.
[00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:19.540]   Your icon before it, your eyebrows look like racing is caterpillar.
[00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:22.700]   I don't even know what icon you're seeing.
[00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:24.860]   I see the same one.
[00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:25.860]   What's that?
[00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:26.860]   I don't even know.
[00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:29.020]   I don't see it on this end, so I don't even know what icon I'm sending.
[00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:31.700]   I better check.
[00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:34.900]   So Patrick is actually in Las Vegas.
[00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:35.900]   He's at McCarran.
[00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:38.100]   He's on Wi-Fi and it actually sounds pretty good.
[00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:42.980]   The best part about traveling in Las Vegas is not the delightful people, the tremendous
[00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:46.020]   events, the first class dining.
[00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:48.020]   It's really the free Wi-Fi in the caron airport.
[00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:52.020]   In fact, I'm practically regularly just used the Wi-Fi.
[00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:53.980]   Let me edit that little clip out.
[00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:54.980]   We'll send it to McCarran.
[00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:57.500]   You probably see it on billboards everywhere.
[00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:01.740]   So Patrick, we've been talking a little bit about CES and the general consensus is in
[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:05.820]   fact, Kevin says he didn't even go to the show for is that it was just too crowded,
[00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:07.980]   too crazy, not worth going.
[00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:11.220]   John C. de Vorek, of course, was the meta reporter.
[00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:14.580]   He just sat back and let other people's blogs cover it.
[00:39:14.580 --> 00:39:18.140]   Where would you have rather been at home or in Vegas this week?
[00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:23.980]   Well, you see, if people like me didn't go to Las Vegas, de Vorek couldn't sit happy,
[00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:29.540]   you know, fat, sassy and next to his massive wine collection blogging about the event.
[00:39:29.540 --> 00:39:31.060]   So we thank you.
[00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:32.380]   It's because of you, right.
[00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:34.340]   Yeah, you're a prince.
[00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:39.380]   He's a soldier for those of us who are able to sit back from the fray.
[00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:40.380]   Thank you.
[00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:41.380]   This one's a little different.
[00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:49.060]   I mean, it is a huge, I'm officially convinced it's bigger than Condex was at Condex's biggest.
[00:39:49.060 --> 00:39:51.260]   It was huge this year.
[00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:55.500]   The boost felt a little more spaced out and they really, you know, I didn't get to see
[00:39:55.500 --> 00:40:02.420]   too much of the show floor until Friday, but the man, they had the Hilton, they had the
[00:40:02.420 --> 00:40:06.460]   LVCC, which includes not just the North and the Central Hall, but the South Halls didn't
[00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:08.820]   even exist when Condex was at its peak.
[00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:12.020]   Plus they had the sands going up both levels again.
[00:40:12.020 --> 00:40:13.020]   So it was pretty wild.
[00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:14.020]   There was a lot going on.
[00:40:14.020 --> 00:40:15.020]   A lot of vendors.
[00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:16.860]   Were you able to see everything?
[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:19.740]   No, I, well, you can't remember something.
[00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:22.660]   I'm producing television in a trailer out in the yard.
[00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:24.140]   So I don't get to see everything.
[00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:28.300]   Patrick, did you make it over to the sands because the other guys didn't?
[00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:33.100]   I got to, I got to walk through the sands on my way to get a shuttle to the LVCC.
[00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:34.940]   So you didn't see the other?
[00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:38.780]   I only had a couple hours today to look around.
[00:40:38.780 --> 00:40:42.580]   And I spent a little bit of time down at the show to look at some of the high-end audio
[00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:44.740]   equipment and there were three or four.
[00:40:44.740 --> 00:40:49.060]   I went to talk to jail audio about subwoofers and a couple other things.
[00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:54.060]   Patrick got to do three DLTV episodes while you were there though.
[00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:55.700]   That's pretty good.
[00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:56.700]   It was fun.
[00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:58.700]   We did three one hour shows.
[00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:02.460]   So it's like, wait, I have my Devoric moment.
[00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:07.820]   www.dl.tv is a great place to go for all your video coverage needs for CES.
[00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:09.740]   How many hours of coverage is three?
[00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:11.860]   Did you do three hour shows?
[00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:13.740]   We did three one hour shows.
[00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:15.860]   Martin Sargent was with you too, right?
[00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:17.900]   Yeah, Martin Sargent was with you too.
[00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:18.900]   Martin Sargent was with you too.
[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:21.260]   A couple of things were a little risque.
[00:41:21.260 --> 00:41:25.340]   We have at least one mother of an 11-year-old who is not pleased with us.
[00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:28.500]   But you guys will probably see the thing and giggle yourself hysterical.
[00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:29.500]   Is it on DLTV?
[00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:31.500]   Yeah, it's up on DLTV.
[00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:35.180]   Yeah, I'm looking at two pictures of him on your homepage.
[00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:40.220]   We just basically told him to go out and find, you know...
[00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:42.540]   And he found a robo- a robo-chimp, huh?
[00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:45.540]   Yeah, he was very much in love with a robo-chimp.
[00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:49.220]   Marty the robo-chimp made a rather fetching couple during that segment.
[00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:52.140]   There was interaction, there was drama, there was pathos.
[00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:56.220]   It was quite a sight actually, this screaming chimp.
[00:41:56.220 --> 00:42:01.100]   Well, I'm just glad Marty is still gainfully employed.
[00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:02.900]   He could have done a segment from Slots of Fun though.
[00:42:02.900 --> 00:42:05.860]   I'm still disappointed that nobody went to Slots of Fun.
[00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:06.860]   I used to love this video.
[00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:08.820]   Marty and Roger went to Slots of Fun.
[00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:10.180]   Oh, did they all good?
[00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:11.180]   Alright.
[00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:14.500]   I'm glad the old traditions are still kept on.
[00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:15.500]   I went to the double-down saloon.
[00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:16.500]   Oh, there you go.
[00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:17.500]   Hey, you had a...
[00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:18.500]   You had a tech team...
[00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:19.820]   You had a tech team down there, right?
[00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:21.060]   On Wednesday, how was that?
[00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:22.060]   With all the...
[00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:23.460]   Hey, you're saying Slots, right?
[00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:24.460]   Yeah.
[00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:26.260]   Okay, you're with.
[00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:29.540]   I lost 160 bucks playing craps in about 20 minutes.
[00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:30.540]   That's Slots of Fun?
[00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:31.540]   No, no, no, at the...
[00:42:31.540 --> 00:42:32.540]   Wow.
[00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:33.540]   I didn't know.
[00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:37.580]   You'd have to work hard at Slots of Fun because I think it's at $2 tables.
[00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:39.500]   The Win Hotel, good buffet by the way.
[00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:40.500]   Oh, really?
[00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:41.500]   That's very good.
[00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:42.500]   Yeah.
[00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:43.500]   Did you stay at the Win this time?
[00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:45.300]   Oh, no, I crashed on Kevin's couch.
[00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:46.300]   No.
[00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:48.060]   Sit in my parents' house.
[00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:49.060]   High budget productions.
[00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:50.860]   That's the kind of budget we were rolling right there.
[00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:56.260]   We've come a long way from the million dollars spent on a Comdex.
[00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:57.500]   So, man.
[00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:59.700]   So what was I going to ask you?
[00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:01.180]   Is there...
[00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:02.420]   Any exciting products at C.E.A.?
[00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:04.420]   Yeah, any exciting products at C.E.A.A.S.?
[00:43:04.420 --> 00:43:09.820]   The Sony reader, I think, was the coolest thing I've seen in a while.
[00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:10.820]   We knew you'd say that.
[00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:11.820]   We knew you.
[00:43:11.820 --> 00:43:12.820]   You know, it's...
[00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:13.820]   We've got to...
[00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:18.460]   I mean, it was one of the first things we put up on this show on Thursday's show.
[00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:21.500]   It's essentially an Americanized version of the Sony Libre.
[00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:22.500]   And it's thinner...
[00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:26.220]   And if I'm reading the specs right, it's thinner and lighter than the original Sony
[00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:30.540]   Libre was, which is a true e-paper-based electronic book.
[00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:32.300]   The screen is extraordinary.
[00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:33.300]   It's really amazing.
[00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:35.300]   And the battery life is incredible.
[00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:36.740]   They're basically out of a charge.
[00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:38.180]   It's supposed to go about 70...
[00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:42.540]   You turn pages about 7,500 times is how to measure it.
[00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:46.780]   And with the onboard storage, they're claiming you can get about 80 novels inside the book.
[00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:50.740]   So that's why they measure battery life by books, not by hours, because it doesn't
[00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:53.580]   use any batteries until you turn the pages.
[00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:54.580]   Exactly.
[00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:55.980]   I mean, essentially, it's like...
[00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:59.500]   It's similar to the Compact Flash in the sense that once the pixels are set, either dark
[00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:04.580]   or light, and then there's no power necessary to maintain that state until you change the
[00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:07.020]   entire page again, until you update the entire page again.
[00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:08.020]   Okay, that's nasty.
[00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:11.700]   Now that's getting a little more intriguing, because it's 80 books and it's going to last
[00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:13.540]   a long time.
[00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:14.540]   Yeah.
[00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:16.940]   And it's very legible.
[00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:19.700]   But it's heavier than a paperback, isn't it?
[00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:22.380]   Actually, I own paperbacks that are heavier than that.
[00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:23.380]   Interesting.
[00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:27.580]   Certainly, the Kryptonomicon would outweigh that handling.
[00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:28.580]   It was...
[00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:29.580]   I mean, it was...
[00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:33.020]   It's more expensive, though, $300 or $400, depending on how you equip it.
[00:44:33.020 --> 00:44:36.420]   Yeah, it's going to be interesting to see what the pricing is right over here.
[00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:37.420]   It's also going to be interesting.
[00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:41.060]   The Libre in Japan, part of the reason why nobody imported that from Japan is because
[00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:45.500]   they had the content really locked down and they interfaced in Japanese.
[00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:46.660]   So it'll be interesting to see.
[00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:50.740]   They're claiming they'll support JPEGs and PDFs and RSS feeds.
[00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:51.740]   Who?
[00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:53.700]   What happens if you drop it?
[00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:55.300]   That's a good question.
[00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:56.300]   It looks pretty.
[00:44:56.300 --> 00:44:57.500]   It looks fairly sturdy.
[00:44:57.500 --> 00:45:00.780]   They also wrapped it in fine faux Corinthian leather.
[00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:02.820]   And I think there's two fold reasons for that.
[00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:09.180]   One, obviously, to give it that fine faux Corinthian library look or a cardomontivan.
[00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:12.620]   Two, it gives it some nice cushioning and padding.
[00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:14.260]   I think it's a bit interesting to see what happens.
[00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:15.260]   I mean, I'm literally like...
[00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:19.340]   It's like an edge of sketch where you drop it and it kind of gets all messed up for me.
[00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:22.220]   I think we'll find out when it ships.
[00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:24.860]   So does it have a networking of some kind?
[00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:26.340]   It must have a ethernet.
[00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:31.780]   No, I believe it's handled by a software package that lives on your computer and then you transfer
[00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:32.780]   it over USB.
[00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:34.100]   You have to use some crappy software.
[00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:35.100]   I've used...
[00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:39.220]   Yeah, well, there's got to be some kind of program to move it on.
[00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:43.180]   I mean, as soon as you start putting wireless in there, you need a huge battery and all
[00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:45.420]   kinds of intelligence to handle the communications.
[00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:50.020]   They're going to have a relatively dumb device and use USB and save the battery life for
[00:45:50.020 --> 00:45:51.020]   a better thing.
[00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:52.020]   That's fine with me.
[00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:53.020]   You're going to put 80 books on there.
[00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:55.900]   Although that makes the RSS a little less exciting.
[00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:58.060]   We go on RSS for a second.
[00:45:58.060 --> 00:46:00.660]   We got a demo of Windows.
[00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:05.900]   I was over there actually with Lloyd Case from Extreme Tech and Jim and a couple other
[00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:07.660]   folks from PC Magazine.
[00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:11.300]   This is the first time I've ever actually gotten to talk to a real genuine person inside a
[00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:12.660]   Microsoft in years, right?
[00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:15.620]   Because we never got to talk to him at Tech TV.
[00:46:15.620 --> 00:46:18.860]   We're asking the questions to do in the "Dog and Pony Show us Windows" media player
[00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:20.020]   at 11.
[00:46:20.020 --> 00:46:21.700]   It's a really clean interface.
[00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:25.060]   It's going to be really interesting to see how people like it compared to the version
[00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:26.620]   now because it's graphics.
[00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:27.620]   It's much more graphical.
[00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:28.620]   It's much cleaner.
[00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:33.340]   But I asked him, "Are there going to be RSS support in Windows Media Player 11?"
[00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:34.340]   Pause.
[00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:35.340]   Wait, hold on.
[00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:36.340]   It's scribbling.
[00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:39.300]   Looking back and forth, we're going to have to ask the product manager, which are the
[00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:40.620]   palm.
[00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:42.140]   So-and-so the palm is in the next office.
[00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:43.140]   We'll have to grab them.
[00:46:43.140 --> 00:46:45.980]   That's where I asked John if you've ever heard of this palm.
[00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:51.540]   No, the funny thing is Microsoft has a whole slew of these weird buzz words that they use
[00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:52.540]   internally.
[00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:55.700]   I've had a lot of meetings with them myself.
[00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:59.540]   They'll just drop one into the conversation because they don't realize that there's an
[00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:00.540]   alien amongst them.
[00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:03.140]   And then I'll ask them, I say, "What if that's a composer to me?"
[00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:04.140]   And then they-
[00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:07.540]   They all clam up and then they won't tell me.
[00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:11.940]   Like, it's a-that's funny.
[00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:14.060]   Well, they grabbed on their way out.
[00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:17.620]   They grabbed the palm for the Windows Media Player 11 and asked them, "Are you going to
[00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:18.940]   have RSS feeds?"
[00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:23.860]   And they don't expect to ship Windows Media Player 11 with RSS support.
[00:47:23.860 --> 00:47:25.860]   Chris Prillo will be very kind of suppressing.
[00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:28.100]   Yeah, Chris Prillo will be very disappointed.
[00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:29.700]   What would you do with RSS support?
[00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:31.700]   I guess catch podcasts for one thing.
[00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:33.660]   Well, catch podcasts, download.dl.tv.
[00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:39.300]   Download an even number of other favorite audio and video programs.
[00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:40.300]   I see.
[00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:41.300]   Yeah, podcast video.
[00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:42.300]   Yeah.
[00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:43.300]   Yeah, I mean-
[00:47:43.300 --> 00:47:45.460]   I've been talking about Avalanche for the longest time, right?
[00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:47.020]   Is there like alternative BitTorrent?
[00:47:47.020 --> 00:47:51.420]   You would think they would have support for like Avalanche and RSS feeds built in.
[00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:53.420]   I mean, how hard can that be, I guess?
[00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:54.420]   I think I'm starting-
[00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:55.420]   I'm starting a letter writing campaign.
[00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:58.900]   You know, I honestly believe that Microsoft's so out of touch with what's actually going
[00:47:58.900 --> 00:48:02.260]   on that they just-they just overlooked it.
[00:48:02.260 --> 00:48:05.620]   When you ask the question, they probably freaked out and somebody like a couple of guys will
[00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:07.100]   be slapping their forehands to it.
[00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:08.900]   They're working right now to write it.
[00:48:08.900 --> 00:48:10.180]   How did we overlook that?
[00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:13.140]   The feeling I got was that they-they were looking at it.
[00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:14.860]   They didn't think they were going to have it in time for launch.
[00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:17.340]   I would just look to the guy and like, "What do you-case of scotch?
[00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:20.540]   How do we get this put up higher on the development of this flat food, the slider and the programmer
[00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:22.980]   stores?"
[00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:27.740]   So maybe if we mail like, you know, tons of packages of craft slices to Microsoft, they
[00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:29.060]   get it together on this.
[00:48:29.060 --> 00:48:32.740]   Any other big stories that CES brought you?
[00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:35.420]   Well, do you guys read about the Google keynote, right?
[00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:37.620]   Yeah, we were kind of slamming the Google pack.
[00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:39.260]   I didn't- wasn't impressed by that.
[00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:42.300]   On the other hand, Google video might be very good for all of us.
[00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:45.300]   Has anybody checked Google's video on the page?
[00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:46.300]   Is it on the page?
[00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:47.300]   Is it on the page?
[00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:48.300]   Yeah.
[00:48:48.300 --> 00:48:49.300]   The pay service isn't up yet.
[00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:50.300]   I don't know.
[00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:52.620]   Google pack, I think, could be a really interesting move for them.
[00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:55.940]   Because it's obviously-you look at it, it's like they did it half just to piss off Microsoft.
[00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:56.940]   Right.
[00:48:56.940 --> 00:48:59.380]   You know, you can't maintain your own operating system.
[00:48:59.380 --> 00:49:00.380]   Let us help you.
[00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:01.380]   Right.
[00:49:01.380 --> 00:49:03.700]   You know, and it's a really interesting idea if they can help, you know, if they can sort
[00:49:03.700 --> 00:49:08.020]   of slither in and-and sorry, help people maintain their systems.
[00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:12.340]   You know, maybe that is their stepping stone to having some sort of online.
[00:49:12.340 --> 00:49:16.340]   I mean, it's like-it sounds like everybody's describing job machines from 1996, you know?
[00:49:16.340 --> 00:49:20.060]   There's going to be an online operating system in Google's going to own the world.
[00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:24.860]   I really think-I'm going to have to go with Jason Callicannis on this and say that their
[00:49:24.860 --> 00:49:28.500]   only real goal is just to get AdSense everywhere.
[00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:29.980]   And that's what they've done.
[00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:34.060]   It packaged up a bunch of programs that will put ads on your system in one form or fashion.
[00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:38.700]   And then they made a deal with Reel and Norton to, you know, put a little extra stuff in
[00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:39.700]   there.
[00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:40.700]   I'm sure they make money off of that.
[00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:41.700]   Right.
[00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:44.780]   Well, it-it's even goes one step further than that they want to get targeted AdSense everywhere.
[00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:45.780]   Yes.
[00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:49.140]   You know, they're bundling all these tools like chat and the ability to search your file
[00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:50.340]   so they know what you're looking at.
[00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:51.340]   Yes.
[00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:52.340]   They know who you're talking to.
[00:49:52.340 --> 00:49:53.340]   Yes.
[00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:56.660]   They know where you're located and they can deliver those, you know, extremely highly targeted
[00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:57.820]   ads and make more money.
[00:49:57.820 --> 00:49:58.820]   That's the key.
[00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:01.740]   That's the key to successive AdSense is that the ads match content that you-
[00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:02.740]   Yeah, you know what though?
[00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:05.140]   I think that they-there's a lot of talk and no action.
[00:50:05.140 --> 00:50:09.700]   I mean, all you have to do is look at anybody's blog that's running ads since I run it myself.
[00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:12.740]   And they miss the mark so often that it's just not even-
[00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:14.340]   I mean, it's just-it's almost funny.
[00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:15.340]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:50:15.340 --> 00:50:16.340]   They should be bad.
[00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:17.340]   I think I'd make more money if they were better.
[00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:21.900]   But we're, you know, I'm making almost 2,000 a month now on very small little AdSense ads.
[00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:27.840]   And I'm sure people who make more of an effort to make the AdSense appear more prominently
[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:29.220]   are doing even better.
[00:50:29.220 --> 00:50:30.220]   There's money to be made.
[00:50:30.220 --> 00:50:33.460]   You know, if I'm making 2 grand, that they're making a lot more.
[00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:34.460]   Right.
[00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:36.220]   Yeah, I know that about it.
[00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:39.980]   You know, yeah, in fact, I think I've come into conclusion that if you look at the-just
[00:50:39.980 --> 00:50:43.660]   the way the numbers work and the fact that what you get your-how you get your few pennies
[00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:48.740]   now and again is that your best bet is to take out the Google AdSense ads rather than
[00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:49.740]   displaying it.
[00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:51.020]   Yeah, I think you're probably right.
[00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:52.020]   I think you're probably right.
[00:50:52.020 --> 00:50:56.580]   And it is-it is, I would say, you know, the vast majority, the bulk of their revenue,
[00:50:56.580 --> 00:50:59.220]   if not all of their revenue, comes from these ads.
[00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:05.940]   So I think that that's Jason Calick-I'll put a link to Jason's blog posting.
[00:51:05.940 --> 00:51:09.220]   But basically his thesis was Google's not a search company.
[00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:11.580]   They're an AdSense company.
[00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:12.580]   That's their business.
[00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:15.420]   And everything they do, if you take it, if you consider it in that light, makes a lot
[00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:16.420]   of sense.
[00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:20.580]   I'm kind of curious to see what they're going to do with the video distribution.
[00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:24.300]   Well, we're hoping that they'll do-you know, I mean, there's many things to like about
[00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:25.300]   it over Apple.
[00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:28.300]   What Apple's been doing, well, one is you could set your own price.
[00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:31.700]   If they take a smaller cut, you could choose whether to have DRM or not.
[00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:32.700]   I mean, I sort of-
[00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:37.260]   Well, is anybody other than-anybody other than the, you know, than the-the-the couple
[00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:40.100]   of Apple's partners actually able to sell video?
[00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:42.340]   You mean on-on Google or on iTunes?
[00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:47.300]   On iTunes, you're not allowed to sell video on iTunes unless you have a special deal,
[00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:48.300]   as far as I know.
[00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:49.300]   Yeah, we-
[00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:50.300]   Like ABC does instead of-
[00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:54.260]   I approached them right away and they said, yeah, we're interested, but right now the
[00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:58.860]   complication, you know, we don't want to do deals with a million different little people,
[00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:00.740]   so we've got to figure out a way to centralize it.
[00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:05.900]   I imagine they'll do something like they do with CD Baby, which gives independent musicians
[00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:07.100]   the chance to sell on iTunes.
[00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:09.100]   You go to some central clearinghouse.
[00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:10.100]   But then-
[00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:11.100]   That's just a bigger cut.
[00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:12.940]   You know, you might be-you might be wrong there, Leo.
[00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:14.220]   And I'll tell you why.
[00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:18.660]   There-you know, in the cable TV business you run into the situation where these-these
[00:52:18.660 --> 00:52:22.300]   deals are made that basically cut out the little guy.
[00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:24.820]   And I wouldn't be surprised if these networks do some sort of thing.
[00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:29.340]   But why are you gonna-if you're gonna give them carriage, you're gonna give us carriage,
[00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:33.420]   we're more important, you know, let's do an exclusive or you can only have that-you
[00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:36.260]   can have us an NBC, but you can't have these little guys.
[00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:39.620]   There's a really strong effort by these big companies to keep little guys from doing what
[00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:40.620]   you described.
[00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:41.620]   You may well be right.
[00:52:41.620 --> 00:52:42.620]   I mean, it's very threatening to them.
[00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:47.060]   Apple-you know, I talked with Apple in the earliest days when they didn't have much content.
[00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:50.500]   Maybe they were using the threat of that to get the big guys to come along now that
[00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:51.500]   they have.
[00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:53.260]   Maybe they don't need the little guys anymore.
[00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:56.940]   Well, have you guys been here and I've got hit from three different directions in the
[00:52:56.940 --> 00:53:02.620]   last couple of weeks that the big announcement at Macworld is gonna be a new version of iTunes
[00:53:02.620 --> 00:53:05.140]   with a lot of the video functionality.
[00:53:05.140 --> 00:53:08.940]   You're-pardon me, my voice is going again.
[00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:14.140]   Oh, and with a lot of increased video, like all the tools that are missing to make video
[00:53:14.140 --> 00:53:17.300]   play on the iPod, the fifth generation iPod.
[00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:20.520]   And some ideas that there's gonna be some interesting stuff done with video distribution
[00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:23.980]   on the inside the software itself.
[00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:25.060]   You know what, buddy?
[00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:28.580]   That makes perfect sense, but I think what's really clear, whether they do or don't, is
[00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:30.380]   that this is the next big thing.
[00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:36.260]   I mean, everybody from Yahoo to Google to Apple is looking at video distribution over the net.
[00:53:36.260 --> 00:53:38.100]   That's the next big thing.
[00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:42.140]   Well, so it was online, you know, bill tracking for lawyers and-
[00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:47.660]   Yeah, maybe it's bogus.com was gonna kill off, you know.
[00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:50.680]   What was IPTV looking like at CES?
[00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:52.520]   Was there a lot of IPTV action?
[00:53:52.520 --> 00:53:53.520]   There is.
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:57.760]   You couldn't swing a dead cat without hitting something that had some angle with online
[00:53:57.760 --> 00:53:59.360]   video or IPTV or-
[00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:04.200]   I mean, and what was bizarre is when you ran into stuff like Modio, which they-
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:07.440]   Nokia had demonstrating on a phone, which is a company who is-
[00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:08.680]   They were called Crown Castle.
[00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:10.240]   They changed their name recently.
[00:54:10.240 --> 00:54:16.960]   They own a ton of 10 megahertz bandwidth, and they're doing a broadcast network for cellular
[00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:17.960]   and portable devices.
[00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:20.460]   And over the air broadcast network, a 10 megahertz.
[00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:24.360]   You know, at the same time, you've got the IPTV stuff.
[00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:29.420]   You've got MobyTV and the Verizon stuff competing on cell phones.
[00:54:29.420 --> 00:54:35.840]   You've got, you know, I could start listening to Google video, Yahoo to go-
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:39.740]   Is it Yahoo video to go or Yahoo video to go?
[00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:43.140]   The Dave TV.
[00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:45.420]   And there's just stuff everywhere.
[00:54:45.420 --> 00:54:48.100]   And there's- The portable players are going to be interesting.
[00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:53.740]   We've got our chances to get our hands on the new Vision M from Creative, which doesn't
[00:54:53.740 --> 00:55:00.580]   seem to have any video DRM agreements in place right now, but is looking to be a fairly
[00:55:00.580 --> 00:55:06.460]   strong competitor to Apple's iPod and delivering their claim in four hours of battery life
[00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:08.700]   out of a similar two and a half in screen.
[00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:10.620]   A lot of portable devices.
[00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:11.620]   One of the-
[00:55:11.620 --> 00:55:12.620]   You know, you-
[00:55:12.620 --> 00:55:13.620]   Go ahead.
[00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:18.860]   And if people want to keep up with IPTV, they go to iptvdaily.com.
[00:55:18.860 --> 00:55:22.260]   One of the people- One of the reasons people were complaining about Google doing its own
[00:55:22.260 --> 00:55:27.140]   DRM instead of using one of the existing solutions is now you've got yet another DRM
[00:55:27.140 --> 00:55:28.140]   standard.
[00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:31.300]   And how are you going to get all device makers to support, you know, 15 different kinds of
[00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:33.140]   copy protection?
[00:55:33.140 --> 00:55:37.060]   I would be really interested to see what, if anything lies under that, because I've
[00:55:37.060 --> 00:55:40.540]   noticed a bunch of people are like, "We have our custom system for protecting our content
[00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:44.100]   is just a re-warmed over, you know, Windows media player."
[00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:46.100]   I don't think Google obviously is doing that.
[00:55:46.100 --> 00:55:47.100]   Yeah, I know.
[00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:48.100]   I'm sure Google is doing it for the internet.
[00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:52.020]   They're going to say, "Well, we can do it better, so we're going to do it ourselves."
[00:55:52.020 --> 00:55:53.740]   But it does raise an issue for consumers.
[00:55:53.740 --> 00:55:56.780]   First of all, consumers don't like copy protection to begin with.
[00:55:56.780 --> 00:56:00.140]   They'll put up with it, but it's got to be easy and there can't be- It can't be- I have
[00:56:00.140 --> 00:56:04.900]   to use one program to copy video from one machine, from one source and another program
[00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:08.220]   to copy from another source and none of it will play on my Zen, but some of it will play
[00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:09.220]   on my iPod.
[00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:11.300]   That's not going to work.
[00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:14.380]   You talk about Betamax versus VHS.
[00:56:14.380 --> 00:56:18.180]   That's like 20 times worse.
[00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:21.380]   Betamax versus a builder on VCR kit in some cases.
[00:56:21.380 --> 00:56:23.060]   I can't remember who it was.
[00:56:23.060 --> 00:56:27.900]   I tested a portable video player last year that he manufactured and listed any of the
[00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:31.060]   specs for compatible video formats for the player.
[00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:32.420]   It plays it all.
[00:56:32.420 --> 00:56:33.420]   Don't worry about it.
[00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:40.500]   No, it played like two bizarre formats and it took us like four or eight attempts to figure
[00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:41.500]   out what they were.
[00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:44.140]   Where's August Morbism when we need it?
[00:56:44.140 --> 00:56:48.420]   Divx actually made a number of good partnerships it looks like with hardware manufacturers to
[00:56:48.420 --> 00:56:49.420]   play back Divx.
[00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:51.420]   They were a number of Divx- Well, they did what Google did.
[00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:54.020]   They didn't think that's how Google was going to be doing the D.I. videos.
[00:56:54.020 --> 00:56:55.020]   Oh, interesting.
[00:56:55.020 --> 00:56:56.020]   I didn't see that.
[00:56:56.020 --> 00:56:57.020]   That's a big deal.
[00:56:57.020 --> 00:56:59.380]   Divx and Google partner up, Yahoo News.
[00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:00.380]   Wow.
[00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:01.460]   That's right.
[00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:03.540]   So some good moves for Divx.
[00:57:03.540 --> 00:57:05.220]   Divx is doing okay.
[00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:10.180]   I installed a bulb, a new Divx stuff and I recorded a bunch of things off the various
[00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:14.180]   devices and put them on my laptop so I can watch movies and things while I'm traveling.
[00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:17.220]   And the sound is never sinking up right on any of it.
[00:57:17.220 --> 00:57:21.300]   It's like the levels are going one way and the text is going.
[00:57:21.300 --> 00:57:26.860]   I have one scene where this Ingmar Bergman and somebody else and Bogart are like talking
[00:57:26.860 --> 00:57:27.860]   to each other.
[00:57:27.860 --> 00:57:32.500]   He's talking on his voice and when he's talking to Turvois it's weird.
[00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:33.700]   It's like a Woody Allen movie.
[00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:34.700]   He's in the Compressant.
[00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:35.700]   Yeah, really.
[00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:36.700]   It's the Divx.
[00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:37.700]   With some Tiger Lily part three.
[00:57:37.700 --> 00:57:40.260]   But I mean, which Divx presser?
[00:57:40.260 --> 00:57:41.660]   Dr. Divx or the...
[00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:43.500]   Well, Dr. Divx is gone, unfortunately.
[00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:44.500]   No, it's the New York.
[00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:45.740]   No, there's an open source version.
[00:57:45.740 --> 00:57:46.740]   Yeah, which I'm glad.
[00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:47.740]   Thank goodness.
[00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:48.740]   And there's a pretty good...
[00:57:48.740 --> 00:57:50.820]   The new Divx tool is pretty amazing, actually.
[00:57:50.820 --> 00:57:51.820]   Is it?
[00:57:51.820 --> 00:57:52.820]   You had a lot of code rewriting.
[00:57:52.820 --> 00:57:57.180]   Yeah, actually, if you're not running the latest version of the Divx tool, it's worth
[00:57:57.180 --> 00:57:58.180]   downloading it.
[00:57:58.180 --> 00:58:00.740]   But again, consumers are having a hell of a time.
[00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:03.340]   And in fact, audio videos sync is one of the biggest issues.
[00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:06.660]   There's no real good way to do it.
[00:58:06.660 --> 00:58:09.020]   That's why people are going to end up buying stuff from iTunes.
[00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:11.540]   Why Kevin's buying stuff from iTunes Music Store?
[00:58:11.540 --> 00:58:12.540]   Because it works, right?
[00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:15.500]   Kevin, you don't have to worry about syncing audio and video.
[00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:16.500]   Exactly.
[00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:18.460]   And you know you're going to get a quality download every time.
[00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:23.820]   Kevin, Mr. BitTorrent, the man that taught me everything I knew about stealing content.
[00:58:23.820 --> 00:58:26.180]   Get a company going and you start paying for stuff.
[00:58:26.180 --> 00:58:27.020]   No, no, no.
[00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:30.660]   I'm not saying BitTorrent doesn't have its uses, but you know, it's one of those things
[00:58:30.660 --> 00:58:35.420]   if you want to collect an archive of ten different episodes of one of your favorite
[00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:39.780]   seasons of Battlestar Galactica or something like that, you're going to want that same
[00:58:39.780 --> 00:58:42.260]   quality across the entire list of episodes.
[00:58:42.260 --> 00:58:44.380]   How much you think it's going to provide it?
[00:58:44.380 --> 00:58:46.980]   Kevin, you can download called Series as One Download.
[00:58:46.980 --> 00:58:47.980]   I know.
[00:58:47.980 --> 00:58:48.980]   $1.99.
[00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:52.460]   You get paid $1.99 to watch Battlestar Galactica?
[00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:53.460]   I would.
[00:58:53.460 --> 00:58:55.580]   You'd have to pay me $5 to watch it.
[00:58:55.580 --> 00:58:58.740]   Did you watch the first season?
[00:58:58.740 --> 00:59:01.380]   You know, I'd rather stick pins in my eyes.
[00:59:01.380 --> 00:59:02.380]   Wow.
[00:59:02.380 --> 00:59:05.980]   Would you have paid a Buck99 to see firefly episodes?
[00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:06.980]   Yes.
[00:59:06.980 --> 00:59:07.980]   Absolutely.
[00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:08.980]   You know what I mean?
[00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:09.980]   I just bit torrented that one.
[00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:10.980]   I didn't.
[00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:16.920]   But yeah, but I mean, what's funny though is I mean, I just did a big chunk of a feature
[00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:20.060]   on BitTorrent and iTunes video.
[00:59:20.060 --> 00:59:22.660]   And it was like the one thing I said in the BitTorrent thing is like, yeah, BitTorrent's
[00:59:22.660 --> 00:59:26.300]   amazing, but it would be so much nicer if you could.
[00:59:26.300 --> 00:59:30.100]   Just like what you said before, Kevin, if you could buy the HBO stuff, like you could
[00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:32.780]   buy Deadwood two weeks after it goes live for a couple bucks.
[00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:33.780]   I totally pay a few dollars.
[00:59:33.780 --> 00:59:34.780]   That's what's going to happen.
[00:59:34.780 --> 00:59:35.780]   That's what's going to happen.
[00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:38.940]   All you're seeing, the reason BitTorrent has been successful up to now is because it's
[00:59:38.940 --> 00:59:43.860]   really a bellwether of the interest that consumers have in getting video this way.
[00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:48.380]   As soon as companies figure out how to do it, reliably, people are going to people
[00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:49.380]   pay for it.
[00:59:49.380 --> 00:59:50.740]   Well, it's just like in the threes.
[00:59:50.740 --> 00:59:55.300]   It's been so long since I've actually downloaded an MP3 legally because I want that quality
[00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:57.740]   and I just go on the iTunes music store and buy it.
[00:59:57.740 --> 01:00:01.460]   This is what we've been saying all along from the day one of Napster.
[01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:04.740]   We kept yelling at these guys, hey, you know, the people want this stuff.
[01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:06.300]   They're not really wanting to steal it.
[01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:08.220]   They just, it's the only way they can get it.
[01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:11.220]   It's funny because it looked like at the keynotes, everybody was saying the thing I've
[01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:15.060]   been saying in my speeches for a long time, consumers just want content where they want
[01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:18.220]   it, when they want it, how they want it with no restrictions.
[01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:20.820]   And finally, that message seems to be coming through.
[01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:24.820]   I mean, there's always going to be a DRM, but I think there are one hopes try to keep
[01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:26.540]   it as unobtrusive as possible.
[01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:30.060]   They do have to solve this issue, though, of multiple DRM solutions.
[01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:33.180]   I was going to say one of the things that sucks right now is that you can't decrypt
[01:00:33.180 --> 01:00:34.420]   your iTunes music.
[01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:35.740]   That's one of the things I am kind of pissed off at.
[01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:37.540]   Jaim doesn't work anymore.
[01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:38.540]   They broke it.
[01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:39.540]   Well, here's the deal.
[01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:40.900]   I don't share with anyone.
[01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:45.140]   I just want to decrypt it so I can move it between my multiple machines and not worry about
[01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:47.340]   authorizing and deauthorizing my music.
[01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:51.100]   And Jaim was great because I could buy the music online, decrypt it, and then do whatever
[01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:52.100]   I want with it.
[01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:53.100]   But now it's broken.
[01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:56.820]   See, this sounds like the Kevin I know and love.
[01:00:56.820 --> 01:01:01.620]   Most of the iTunes updates of the last four or five updates have been not to improve it,
[01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:05.660]   not to add a feature to turn it to reverse copy protection.
[01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:07.140]   That's the stuff.
[01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:08.140]   Yeah.
[01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:14.940]   Did you hear, according to Reuters, the digital track sales tally last year was 142.5%
[01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:20.460]   and this year it's 147% more at 350,000,000.
[01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:22.460]   That's just about to say.
[01:01:22.460 --> 01:01:23.460]   Yeah, but you know what?
[01:01:23.460 --> 01:01:24.780]   When a million of it was in the last seven days in the year.
[01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:27.580]   Do you think we're about to see the same thing with video?
[01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:29.460]   Yeah, because more bandwidth.
[01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:31.740]   Well, guys, guys, take a step back from that.
[01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:36.700]   If you read the rest of the article that came from David, they're also losing money because
[01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:39.940]   they make about 10% of the amount of download.
[01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:42.940]   Oh, they claim that the numbers say they're making, they're saying they're saying they're
[01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:46.380]   on a download, they make up about 10% of what they do off of the DVD.
[01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:48.980]   They've done something grossly inflated price.
[01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:50.580]   They've done something stupid.
[01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:53.660]   No, this is called creative bookkeeping.
[01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:54.660]   Yeah.
[01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:55.660]   More likely.
[01:01:55.660 --> 01:01:56.660]   Anything.
[01:01:56.660 --> 01:01:58.300]   Well, I mean, it's 142% and you make less money.
[01:01:58.300 --> 01:02:00.940]   Yeah, you're stupid or you're lying.
[01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:03.180]   No, but guys, guys, guys, listen to me.
[01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:05.580]   CD sales are down.
[01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:08.220]   You know, individual track sales and all my downloads are on our own.
[01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:09.540]   CD sales are going to never go back up.
[01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:12.220]   They are going to go down until they go to zero.
[01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:13.220]   It's the end of the month.
[01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:17.140]   I know what I'm saying though, is they're used to scamming so much money out of people.
[01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:19.860]   DVD sales costs $2 to make, right?
[01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:20.860]   So their margins are small.
[01:02:20.860 --> 01:02:22.580]   And they're still, if you scam it.
[01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:24.700]   What does it cost them to make a digital decision?
[01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:26.300]   It's not $2 even.
[01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:27.980]   It's only about, it's less than $1.
[01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:30.580]   But what does it cost them to make a download?
[01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:31.580]   Zilch.
[01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:32.580]   Well, C-O-R-O.
[01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:36.180]   With distribution, the maintenance of the website.
[01:02:36.180 --> 01:02:38.020]   That's also Apple's got it.
[01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:39.540]   Apple's the one is not making any money.
[01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:42.500]   I guarantee you, the music industry is making a ton of money.
[01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:46.900]   No, what I'm saying though, is what the music industry says is they're making money, but
[01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:48.220]   they make less money off of it.
[01:02:48.220 --> 01:02:51.660]   They're claiming they make less money off of a digital track than they do off of a CD
[01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:52.660]   track.
[01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:53.660]   And you believe them?
[01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:58.220]   Actually, if you think about it, if it's a 10 song album and you pay 10 bucks on iTunes,
[01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:03.380]   they're going to rip you for $18 in CDs and half of the retail stores in North America.
[01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:06.780]   Well, the case I would make is that that business is going to die no matter what.
[01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:10.540]   So you guys can get 10 bucks or you get no bucks.
[01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:12.300]   You ain't going to get 18 bucks.
[01:03:12.300 --> 01:03:16.940]   I think we settled that.
[01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:18.980]   So let's get back to the question then.
[01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:22.540]   Is video the next frontier for this?
[01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:24.540]   It has to be.
[01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:27.460]   I'm going to disagree with this one.
[01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:29.620]   Of course, I'm disagreeing in the short term.
[01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:33.580]   I think video is the next frontier, but it's way out until we get better bandwidth in this
[01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:34.580]   country.
[01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:36.580]   It's falling behind.
[01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:38.620]   We're like 15th or worse in the world.
[01:03:38.620 --> 01:03:41.180]   Actually, we were up to 13th as of November.
[01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:42.180]   Oh, wow.
[01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:43.180]   But it still we're pretty pathetic.
[01:03:43.180 --> 01:03:44.180]   But it's interesting.
[01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:48.220]   Look how long it took for us to turn around from CDs to download the music.
[01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:50.020]   Look how quickly this video thing is happening.
[01:03:50.020 --> 01:03:51.500]   It's having much faster.
[01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:52.500]   Yeah.
[01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:56.140]   And it's going to saturate fast too, because there's not enough people with enough bandwidth
[01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:59.140]   to do it, you know, on mass.
[01:03:59.140 --> 01:04:00.860]   And there's one other problem, I think.
[01:04:00.860 --> 01:04:06.100]   And that is that everyone keeps going crazy about HD and HD looks fricking awesome.
[01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:08.660]   But that bandwidth that that requires is ridiculous.
[01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:12.940]   So if you get used to liking your HD, I don't think you're going to be able to find it on
[01:04:12.940 --> 01:04:15.060]   Google video or iTunes anytime soon.
[01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:17.820]   I mean, they can they can compress it and make it look like that.
[01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:19.740]   But the bandwidth they just can't do it.
[01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:20.740]   Isn't it?
[01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:21.740]   They're both happening at the same time.
[01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:26.780]   We're both moving to this lower quality streaming and downloadable video.
[01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:29.740]   And then this higher quality, you know, high definition video.
[01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:31.740]   Yeah, you know, it's a world wide.
[01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:33.820]   Leo, it's like a worldwide political trend.
[01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:35.700]   If you think about it, you have the EC and bulk.
[01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:38.220]   Andization taking place at the same time.
[01:04:38.220 --> 01:04:39.220]   Wow.
[01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:40.220]   Wow.
[01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:41.220]   I love profundity.
[01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:42.220]   I got it.
[01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:43.220]   I have to wrap my head out.
[01:04:43.220 --> 01:04:44.220]   You can write jeans down.
[01:04:44.220 --> 01:04:45.220]   Holy moly.
[01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:47.700]   That's going in the show notes.
[01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:49.700]   Let me go.
[01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:51.700]   The main world wide.
[01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:55.820]   EC and bulk andization at the same time.
[01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:56.820]   Maybe that is.
[01:04:56.820 --> 01:04:57.820]   Maybe you're right.
[01:04:57.820 --> 01:04:58.820]   Maybe there's a political thing going on here.
[01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:04.420]   Well, on the other hand, high fidelity music as we've talked about before is history.
[01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:07.900]   Everybody's moving towards low quality downloadable music formats.
[01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:11.860]   I myself hope that CDs, Lig, are on for a while.
[01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:16.020]   Well, anybody who wants to do multiple formats, so that I would violate the Digital Oneeum
[01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:21.620]   Copyright Act by cracking their audio so they can have it on four different systems or without
[01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:24.100]   buying a Sonos system or something.
[01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:27.140]   I mean, it's kind of, I don't know.
[01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:31.740]   I guess maybe that's the last best hope for the $18 CD is the copy protection and the
[01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:35.300]   low quality of a downloadable one will keep you from doing it.
[01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:37.740]   Well, it would be interesting to me to be enough.
[01:05:37.740 --> 01:05:41.780]   If you think about it this way, if Sony will buy into that horrible root kit pseudo copy
[01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:46.400]   protection they put on the disk, I'm sure they'll be willing to dump CDs to move everything
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:52.220]   to online and try to do some sort of rotating horrible copy encryption management system
[01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:56.220]   that has a proprietary player or something just as asinine.
[01:05:56.220 --> 01:05:58.380]   You just talked about your ebook reader.
[01:05:58.380 --> 01:06:00.940]   That's what you're talking about right there.
[01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:05.780]   And yeah, but the book reader, but they're saying what they're saying about the ebook
[01:06:05.780 --> 01:06:09.180]   reader is that it's going to actually, you're going to be able to import content into it.
[01:06:09.180 --> 01:06:11.580]   Yeah, but you'll have to go through that Sony program.
[01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:13.580]   Yeah, if it's Sony, it's baloney.
[01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:14.580]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:06:14.580 --> 01:06:19.020]   Sony makes the user program, even for PDFs and JPEGs, you'll have to go through the
[01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:20.020]   Sony program.
[01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:22.220]   Well, Apple makes you use iTunes.
[01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:24.060]   You know, and what do people do?
[01:06:24.060 --> 01:06:29.380]   They hack ways around that there's half dozen applications that, you know, there's a there's
[01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:32.180]   a there's a win amp plug in that'll actually allow you to contact.
[01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:33.620]   I got an idea.
[01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:39.220]   What topic number two, which is the E.C. and ball.
[01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:42.060]   Not really pretty much wrapped.
[01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:44.060]   I think CES is done.
[01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:49.900]   Now we're going to do a live show from the Zeeam Tuesday, the 10th.
[01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:52.580]   It'll be the evening of Tuesday, the 10th, the day.
[01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:54.460]   The evening of live or live to take?
[01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:58.220]   Well, live for the listeners, but live for us.
[01:06:58.220 --> 01:07:00.260]   We'll be in the Zeeam, which is a beautiful theater.
[01:07:00.260 --> 01:07:01.260]   Well, you see it.
[01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:03.140]   We have about 170 seats.
[01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:04.300]   I think they're all gone.
[01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:07.660]   In fact, I think we have a waiting list of about 75, but you may still be.
[01:07:07.660 --> 01:07:09.900]   Is that Tuesday, the 10th you're talking about?
[01:07:09.900 --> 01:07:10.900]   Tuesday.
[01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:12.460]   Wozniakle, join us.
[01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:15.900]   David Pogue is going to stop by and Chris Breen.
[01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:20.260]   And if any of you would like to come, it'll be seven o'clock.
[01:07:20.260 --> 01:07:21.820]   If it's 6.30, the door is open.
[01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:22.820]   It's 6, I think.
[01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:26.220]   But if you're not there by 6.30, we're going to start giving your seats away.
[01:07:26.220 --> 01:07:28.980]   And I think there'll be a little bit to talk about.
[01:07:28.980 --> 01:07:30.620]   I certainly hope so.
[01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:32.660]   Yeah, that would be nice.
[01:07:32.660 --> 01:07:36.180]   I want to thank the folks on AOL Radio and their podcast channel for broadcasting our
[01:07:36.180 --> 01:07:39.260]   show, and providing us for the bandwidth to bring you this show.
[01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:41.020]   Our BitTorrent servers will be coming back up.
[01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:44.700]   In fact, they should be back up by the time this makes air.
[01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:45.700]   So we'll have audio and video.
[01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:50.060]   And it'll take a little while for me to get all of the stuff back over, though.
[01:07:50.060 --> 01:07:52.940]   I have to see all of the old shows as well.
[01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:55.580]   But we'll get the new shows up right away.
[01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:58.340]   We've got a whole new dedicated server just for BitTorrent.
[01:07:58.340 --> 01:08:02.940]   And it's running very swift.
[01:08:02.940 --> 01:08:07.260]   So our final verdict on CES, so you're all going to go next year?
[01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:08.260]   Of course.
[01:08:08.260 --> 01:08:09.260]   I am.
[01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:12.580]   There's going to be three million square feet of exhibition space.
[01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:15.580]   I'm going to go again next year the same way I went this year.
[01:08:15.580 --> 01:08:16.580]   Me too.
[01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:18.740]   I'm going to be with John's house to have some more dough while we...
[01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:19.740]   The virtual sea.
[01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:21.340]   I think it's going to be more and more.
[01:08:21.340 --> 01:08:22.620]   I mean, look at it this time.
[01:08:22.620 --> 01:08:24.180]   I've never seen coverage like this online.
[01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:27.780]   I think there'll be less and less reason to go to CES every year.
[01:08:27.780 --> 01:08:30.980]   But as long as you guys slog it out, make sure you get some really good parties, most
[01:08:30.980 --> 01:08:32.900]   of which I missed.
[01:08:32.900 --> 01:08:34.460]   The Foo Fighters played for Motorola.
[01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:35.460]   Wow.
[01:08:35.460 --> 01:08:36.460]   Geez.
[01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:37.460]   Actually, I'm really pissed at Motorola's PR people.
[01:08:37.460 --> 01:08:40.500]   I had three other phones and a couple other items on the show on Thursday.
[01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:43.020]   They didn't tell me the Foo Fighters were playing at their party Thursday night.
[01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:44.180]   They didn't tell me about the party.
[01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:45.500]   Stevie Wonder on Friday night.
[01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:47.420]   Somebody tell me the who were playing Saturday night.
[01:08:47.420 --> 01:08:48.420]   Was that true?
[01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:49.420]   That should have been fried.
[01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:50.420]   I don't think so.
[01:08:50.420 --> 01:08:54.140]   There was a private event with Samsung with the who they were there.
[01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:57.140]   These Peacetownson and the other guy was there.
[01:08:57.140 --> 01:09:00.140]   And I think the Black Crows played for AMD, I believe.
[01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:01.140]   Yeah.
[01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:02.140]   Really?
[01:09:02.140 --> 01:09:03.140]   Wow.
[01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:06.220]   Yeah, it's a kid that would make a money if the serious parties are back.
[01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:07.220]   That must be.
[01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:10.980]   Yeah, that's a good sign the economy's coming around.
[01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:13.580]   And Tom Cruise and Danny DeVito were there.
[01:09:13.580 --> 01:09:15.700]   And Robert Williams was there.
[01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:17.260]   And Justin Timberlake.
[01:09:17.260 --> 01:09:21.700]   And Robin Williams was apparently really, really out of control.
[01:09:21.700 --> 01:09:22.940]   I heard it was very funny.
[01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:25.740]   Yeah, but they couldn't print any of it.
[01:09:25.740 --> 01:09:27.420]   Is that going to be on the stream?
[01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:29.660]   I mean, can we watch that on the stream or do they cut that?
[01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:33.860]   They wouldn't let us record it.
[01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:37.580]   They knew it was going to be score early.
[01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:38.580]   I love it.
[01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:39.580]   Mensa Boy.
[01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:42.420]   Yeah, Roger actually is the one that has the scoop on that one, Roger Chang.
[01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:43.420]   He called Larry Pader.
[01:09:43.420 --> 01:09:44.420]   He was there.
[01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:45.420]   Mensa Boy.
[01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:47.820]   I like that.
[01:09:47.820 --> 01:09:48.820]   Back to you, Mensa Boy.
[01:09:48.820 --> 01:09:49.820]   All right.
[01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:50.820]   Hey, thanks everybody.
[01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:52.340]   Another twit is in the can.
[01:09:52.340 --> 01:09:53.140]   We'll see you Tuesday.
[01:09:53.140 --> 01:10:21.340]   And there's Patrick's plane.
[01:10:21.340 --> 01:10:27.020]   Patrick, you'll be glad to hear my car was not stolen.
[01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:28.660]   It was not stolen.
[01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:31.820]   I was going to actually ask you whether or not a stolen.
[01:10:31.820 --> 01:10:33.420]   So what happened to poet?
[01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:35.180]   No, I was one block off.
[01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:36.180]   That's all.
[01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:38.460]   I thought my car was one block closer than it really was.
[01:10:38.460 --> 01:10:40.660]   I should have put this on me.
[01:10:40.660 --> 01:10:42.300]   Wait a minute.
[01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:43.300]   Where was that?
[01:10:43.300 --> 01:10:44.300]   Was that in Vegas?
[01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:47.460]   No, just last night I was coming home from out in the Mission District.
[01:10:47.460 --> 01:10:50.060]   My car was, I thought I parked my car one block closer.
[01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:54.140]   And there was the exact same little parking spot that was open with the same green little
[01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:55.900]   logo on the parking.
[01:10:55.900 --> 01:10:58.780]   So what kind of car are you driving?
[01:10:58.780 --> 01:11:00.620]   A Volvo C70.
[01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:02.060]   Very popular with the thieves.
[01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:06.980]   Oh yeah, those guys in the Mission Boy, those Volvos, they're high in their list.
[01:11:06.980 --> 01:11:08.580]   I was driving him up on the Impala.
[01:11:08.580 --> 01:11:10.980]   I was driving a white Lexus coupe.
[01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:12.620]   And it just disappeared.
[01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:14.620]   Didn't she help you look for it for her?
[01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:15.620]   I know.
[01:11:15.620 --> 01:11:16.620]   Who's she?
[01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:17.620]   The white Lexus coupe.
[01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:18.620]   The girl you were with?
[01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:19.620]   Mindy?
[01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:20.620]   Who's Mindy?
[01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:21.620]   Yeah, who's that?
[01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:22.620]   There's no one.
[01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:23.620]   Is she from Japan?
[01:11:23.620 --> 01:11:27.620]   No, she's not from Japan and that's a great change of subject.
[01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:29.620]   This is amazing.
[01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:36.620]   I should have paid attention.
[01:11:36.620 --> 01:11:44.620]   I don't know what I'm going to do.
[01:11:44.620 --> 01:11:45.620]   Too much work.
[01:11:45.620 --> 01:11:47.620]   The problem is, there's no limit.
[01:11:47.620 --> 01:11:50.620]   I'm going to do it.
[01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:51.620]   I'm going to do it.
[01:11:51.620 --> 01:11:52.620]   I'm going to do it.
[01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:53.620]   I'm going to do it.
[01:11:53.620 --> 01:11:54.620]   I'm going to do it.
[01:11:54.620 --> 01:11:55.620]   I'm going to do it.
[01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:56.620]   I'm going to do it.
[01:11:56.620 --> 01:11:57.620]   I'm going to do it.
[01:11:57.620 --> 01:11:58.620]   I'm going to do it.
[01:11:58.620 --> 01:11:59.620]   There's no limit.
[01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:00.620]   My server is completely collapsed.
[01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:02.620]   So here's the deal.
[01:12:02.620 --> 01:12:06.620]   I'm just trying to get the thing off, but I have a hell of a ton of blue screens.
[01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:07.620]   Like forget it.
[01:12:07.620 --> 01:12:08.620]   I'm killing you.
[01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:09.620]   I'm killing you.
[01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:10.620]   I'm killing you.
[01:12:10.620 --> 01:12:11.620]   I'm killing you.
[01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:12.620]   I'm killing you.
[01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:13.620]   I'm killing you.
[01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:14.620]   I'm killing you.
[01:12:14.620 --> 01:12:15.620]   I'm killing you.
[01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:16.620]   I'm killing you.
[01:12:16.620 --> 01:12:17.620]   I'm killing you.
[01:12:17.620 --> 01:12:18.620]   I'm killing you.
[01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:19.620]   I'm killing you.
[01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:20.620]   I'm killing you.

[01:12:22.620 --> 01:12:23.620]   I'm killing you.
[01:12:23.620 --> 01:12:24.620]   I'm killing you.
[01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:25.620]   I'm killing you.
[01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:26.620]   I'm killing you.
[01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:27.620]   I'm killing you.
[01:12:27.620 --> 01:12:28.620]   I'm killing you.
[01:12:28.620 --> 01:12:29.620]   I'm killing you.
[01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:30.620]   I'm killing you.
[01:12:30.620 --> 01:12:31.620]   I'm killing you.
[01:12:31.620 --> 01:12:32.620]   I'm killing you.
[01:12:32.620 --> 01:12:33.620]   I'm killing you.

[01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:39.620]   I'm killing you.
[01:12:39.620 --> 01:12:40.620]   I'm killing you.
[01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:41.620]   I'm killing you.
[01:12:41.620 --> 01:12:42.620]   I'm killing you.
[01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:43.620]   I'm killing you.
[01:12:43.620 --> 01:12:44.620]   I'm killing you.
