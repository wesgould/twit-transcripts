[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400]   This is Twit, this week in Tech, episode 19 for August 22nd, 2005.
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:31.400]   [Music]
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.400]   Wow, it's a big cast today.
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.200]   Let me see if I can introduce everybody here, sitting to my right Patrick Norton with his
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.200]   fishbone shirt.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.200]   Is that a punk-scaw?
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.200]   Yeah.
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.200]   Kevin Rose.
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.200]   Hello.
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:46.200]   Good to see you.
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.600]   Sitting behind Kevin, his counselor.
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.200]   Is this going to be for the future for Kevin?
[00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.800]   Anytime we ask you something, you're going to whisper in your ear.
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.800]   That's a Scientology rap.
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:55.800]   Alright.
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.000]   On Skype, we've got Roger Chang from GameSpot.com.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   Hey Roger.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Hey, what's up?
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.800]   Steve Gibson, also on Skype.
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:03.800]   Steve's found a new technique.
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.400]   We're going to talk about that a little bit later on.
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.800]   Glad to be joining the gang.
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.800]   Join the gang and via phone, as we still can't.
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.000]   John C. Devorex, what is the deal, John, with your Skype?
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Why are we not able to ever get it?
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   I don't know about the funny thing, it was like I tried to move it over to a laptop today.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.300]   In the first time I ever used Skype, it worked fine, but now it's not working for crap.
[00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.800]   But I moved to the laptop and it crashed and had to send a message back to Skype headquarters.
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.800]   [Laughter]
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.000]   You, we have penetrated Devorex's office.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   You've become the brainwashing.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   I don't think so.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.600]   At least that program probably knows how to get a message back to headquarters.
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.360]   We're not convinced of that.
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.400]   One hopes, but you do have a new internet access.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.000]   Yeah, that didn't help, did it?
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Well, did briefly.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.600]   We were able to, I don't know.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.400]   I think then we had problems with your microphone.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.400]   You know what?
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.240]   You deserve to be on the phone.
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.000]   By popular demand, can you just do one thing for me, John?
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Oh, gladly.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.520]   Can you say I get no spam?
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.000]   I get no spam.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   It's a fact.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   It's unbelievable.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   You know, there's a loco?
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Do you get any email?
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Is it Avatar that's got John's head and it says I get no spam?
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   I get no spam.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.640]   You know, I get more spam on my blog.
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.040]   And the thing is, you know, you got it.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.000]   We're working on that part of it because that's a little harder to beat because, you
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.800]   know, there's certain things you can do, but we do have, you know, we are blocking IPs
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.900]   left and right now.
[00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.480]   That's a big problem on Wiki's blogs and websites anywhere where you like comments.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.320]   These stupid, Fenteramine- Party poker.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.480]   Party poker and all that.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.480]   Geez.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.480]   You just get on there.
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.480]   I'm kidding.
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.480]   What are they up to?
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.480]   Are they automated?
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.480]   I don't think so.
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.480]   It seems like people.
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.880]   They always put a comment in like, yes, I agree.
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:38.880]   By the way, party poker.com.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.880]   I love that one.
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:40.880]   I love that one.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.880]   I got to know it.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.880]   It has nothing to do with the topic.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.880]   Yeah.
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:46.880]   Yes, I agree.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.880]   And grow here naturally.
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.880]   Well, the other favorite one is, wow, you've got a great blog.
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.680]   It's unbelievably good.
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.120]   And then they have some link to something that's, you know, some spam.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.600]   And I can't imagine how many bloggers who probably have like no customers.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.600]   And you know, they say, let me post this.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.600]   Yeah, right.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.600]   Oh, wow.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.520]   Somebody actually put a comment on my blog.
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.720]   Well, they're finally starting.
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.960]   There's a couple different services.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.480]   Typehead now has that type key.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.480]   That works pretty well.
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.480]   It works pretty well.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.760]   It requires you to actually create a count and log in before you can comment on someone's
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.760]   blog.
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.720]   And then, blogger decided to capture images.
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.960]   So you have to actually physically type in that little image that you know, every time.
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.320]   Well, you know, they have those add-ins for WordPress too, which is what I use.
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.160]   But I find them annoying when I run into them.
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.240]   So I'm trying to avoid both of those things.
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.600]   But then what's the option, just administrating, administering it constantly.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.000]   You just have to block a lot of IPs.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.480]   And luckily, the newest WordPress has a Mark Allis spam.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.000]   So what you do is just go through the comments and say yes to the ones that you like.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.840]   And then click on the button that says Mark Allis spam and erases them all.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.120]   You know, I have good eyesight.
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.160]   And sometimes I am unable to type those capture things incorrectly.
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.720]   It's like, what the hell is that?
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.720]   Is that an all-in-law?
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.360]   Especially if it's both lower and upper cage.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.200]   I find it really difficult when I'm on acid because you can't really tell if it's you
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.200]   or the capture.
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.560]   How do you discern anything on the screen when you're on acid?
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.840]   Oh, everything else looks crisp and clear.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.920]   Except for the snakes.
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.440]   What are you guys talking about?
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.120]   Did you hear that Hunter S. Thompson's funeral was today?
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.120]   It was yesterday.
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.120]   They came up as ashes.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.120]   Well, they shot him out of cannon, right?
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.120]   No, no, they didn't.
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.640]   They were originally going to do that of a cannon.
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.480]   They couldn't get the permit to do the cannon.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:26.560]   So Johnny Depp paid to build a 15-foot tower that was in the emblence of the sort of freak
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:32.680]   power campaign that the double-fisted thumb he used to do for the Gonzo movements.
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.080]   And they blew the ashes out with fireworks.
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.080]   Oh, that's so great.
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.360]   White, blue, and green fireworks.
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.600]   So was he cremated right after then?
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.360]   Usually what one does with a body in the US.
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.360]   I don't know.
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.360]   He was cremated after one.
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.360]   Oh, because it was a long time ago that he died.
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.360]   Yeah.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.360]   Yeah, it's been months.
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.360]   Yeah.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.320]   So, you know, I was sitting there in someone's, like, fire mantle.
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.200]   That's not unusual either, Roger.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.320]   I think they should have taken him to Burning Man and just put him on the Burning Man.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.120]   I don't really think Burning Man was Thompson's style, like, 40 years ago.
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.320]   He was, like, amateur.
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.320]   Yeah.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.280]   Did you ever know him, Jack, as you were a columnist at the exam at the same time he
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.280]   was.
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.600]   Yeah, I worked with him, had a couple lunches and chatted with him a few times over the
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.320]   phone when he was getting his computer set up.
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.960]   Was he as Gonzo in person as he pretended to be in this book?
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.520]   I thought it was just kind of, well, I've heard stories, but I never got to witness anything
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.520]   really weird.
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.920]   I mean, I did witness the fact that he liked to drink a lot.
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:26.920]   Yeah.
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.360]   And I went to a couple of Christmas parties where he was at.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:36.640]   One time we went to the camp in place and had lunches with Hirst and Warren Hinkle.
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:44.280]   And Hunter had a tumbler, a full tumbler, like a glass, water glass tumbler full of shivis.
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.920]   I thought that was kind of interesting.
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.920]   That takes the two fingers.
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.120]   You were drinking wine, you know, and he's drinking a tumbler.
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.120]   The whole tumbler is amazing.
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.320]   You guys don't disrespect, but you guys just don't understand the whole concept of alcoholism
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.320]   to you.
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.280]   That's the resident sober person.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.280]   Let me explain it to you.
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:03.280]   Tumbler is shivis.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.280]   Yeah.
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.280]   That's the single serving sentence.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.280]   It's empty.
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:08.280]   You read the whole drink.
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.120]   The next day, I mean, oh my God, just get it.
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.520]   Actually, don't get hangouts.
[00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:19.760]   Yeah, a lot of people, their liver adapts, Steve, and they consume either their liver's
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.640]   adapt or the other thing you do is you start drinking again before you have the full impact
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.280]   of the hangover and you just smooth it off.
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.280]   Wow.
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.280]   You never really cut the zipper.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:33.240]   You get the point where people will be drinking like a court or a leader or whatever you want
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.480]   to call those a portal a day when the total caloric intake.
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.520]   You know, the other funny thing I found about him was that he was really interested in,
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:43.920]   if anyone, and I like to do this, was to deconstruct his writing.
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:44.920]   Really?
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:45.920]   His own writing?
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:49.760]   Yeah, he never, he didn't seem to me to be overconfident as a writer and he was always
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.360]   looking for like, you know, what you thought of things.
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.360]   I found that unusual.
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.240]   And the other thing I found out from him was that Faulkner was his real influence.
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.400]   Yeah, that doesn't surprise me.
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:00.920]   Well, that's why he was always deconstructing his writing.
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.400]   As you look at his letters and he's like, he's bagging on himself for 30 bucks.
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.200]   It's hard to live up to Faulkner.
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.200]   That's a pretty high standard.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.840]   But do you want to live up to Faulkner?
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:13.040]   If you're in loathing in Las Vegas, Yachnapatafa County, I don't know.
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:14.040]   It's tough choice.
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.360]   So let's talk about tech, the Zotab virus.
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:21.480]   Steve and I talked about it pretty extensively in the new security podcast we're doing.
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.800]   But what do you think?
[00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:24.800]   Who's to blame here?
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:29.320]   About 35% of IT executives blame Microsoft.
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:30.320]   Is that ridiculous?
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.720]   Should you blame the virus author?
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.720]   The problem is that people are not patching immediately.
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.720]   There's a lot of criticism.
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.720]   But you can't patch.
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.200]   If you're in a corporation and you have 5,000 computers.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:46.760]   Exactly, because we've run across situations where the patch is where we break other things.
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:47.760]   Right.
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.760]   And so they have to be fully vetted before they're able to verify that it's not going
[00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:51.760]   to create some other problem.
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:55.240]   A number of IT execs wrote me because I talked about this a little bit on the air and they
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:59.120]   said, look, you've got to understand we cannot just run and apply these patches.
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.320]   We've got to test them.
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.320]   It takes us.
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.000]   So if they've got a three day turnaround on the virus, as they did in this case, we're
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.520]   not going to be able to patch in time.
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.400]   Can somebody describe how the virus works?
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:14.640]   The virus uses it's a remote net bios port 445 exploit for Windows 2000.
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.400]   So it's a worm.
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.400]   Yeah.
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.760]   Which means it infects you without any.
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:19.760]   Right.
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:24.360]   So what happened was all the corporations that had corporate firewalls protecting their
[00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:25.840]   perimeters, they were safe.
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:31.760]   But employees picked this thing up at home or elsewhere over the weekend, brought them
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:36.560]   in inside the corporate network and it just went wild.
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.440]   What did it do?
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.840]   It infects the machines, installs a backdoor.
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:48.040]   There's actually, Zotan was the first, but there's now 12 and counting different worms
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:52.600]   which are all variations on three primary worms.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:56.480]   And so it's just become a real worm fest.
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:02.600]   Log into an IRC server that then gives the hacker the ability to command your machine.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.240]   It had several commands.
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.800]   One was download this file so you could put any arbitrary code on there.
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.760]   So it does guide you with the great zombie machines or what?
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:11.760]   Yes.
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:12.760]   Okay.
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.680]   That's the idea of all viruses these days, right?
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:19.200]   I mean, it's not, it's now to take over your machine so that you'll be forwarding spam
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:21.200]   or used for a DDOS attack.
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.720]   I mean, what other purpose is there?
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.640]   Do we have a count on how many machines were affected?
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:28.080]   I don't think that many, the problem was it affected all these big media companies who
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.920]   then said, "This is the worst thing that's ever happened."
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.320]   It was a lot more than just large media companies.
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.320]   Oh, sure was.
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:37.040]   Who runs Windows 2000 and Office of Virates, right?
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.760]   You know, half the fortune went thousand firms in the planet.
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:43.920]   But all the attention was CNN, New York Times, ABC, Disney.
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:50.560]   It's funny to watch CNN and Wolf Blitzer try to explain what's going on.
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.480]   And they said it was Windows 99.
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.480]   No, they did.
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.480]   They did.
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.480]   That's all your kids.
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.480]   On the air.
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:00.640]   That is embarrassing.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:01.640]   Which is worse?
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:05.000]   Connie Chung saying, "Dose," instead of "Doss" to Bill Gates.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.400]   "Doss" is Steve Jobes.
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.400]   Steve Jobes.
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.400]   "Dose."
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:14.640]   I got a "Doss" is "Zotob" for you.
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.520]   I think the real problem here is, you know, we've all been worrying about these so-called
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:22.840]   zero-day problems where something could take over the net or do some real damage in,
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.120]   you know, like virtually zero time.
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:30.400]   But the significant factor here was that never was there a public disclosure of what
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.120]   the vulnerability was.
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:37.000]   This thing was reverse engineered from the fix for the vulnerability.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.400]   So within three days of issuing the patch, they basically took the patch, figured out
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:48.400]   what was changed in the DLLs, and determined what the vulnerability was, then exploited
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.520]   the vulnerability, and had to worm out and running on the net within three days.
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:53.520]   Pretty remarkable, really.
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:58.640]   So essentially, Microsoft now, it's not about not disclosing the vulnerability.
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:01.520]   They can't even fix the vulnerability.
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:02.520]   Wow.
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.520]   That's great.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:10.520]   So I mean from a memory perspective, not from the users.
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.320]   No, but it's amazing.
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.320]   It's amazing.
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.320]   Yeah.
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:19.760]   Back to the question I posed, whose fault is it?
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:26.760]   Ultimately, we have to hold Microsoft accountable for having an operating system out there, which
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:27.920]   has these problems.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:33.400]   I mean, as you and I talked about, actually, it was a last segment you and I did last week
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:41.520]   up in Canada, Leo, vulnerabilities, security vulnerabilities are incredibly hard to guard
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:44.960]   against preemptively, but it has to be done.
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.440]   I mean, Microsoft's got a ton of money.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:52.320]   Let's have to put more money in to making this stuff not have problems.
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:56.160]   Although what's interesting is this did not impact XP.
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.480]   Microsoft has put a ton of money into protecting XP.
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.960]   It impacted 2000.
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:00.960]   That's a good point.
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:05.440]   And XP was not insecure, even if it was not behind a firewall.
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:06.440]   It would have taken money.
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.960]   You couldn't have created a worm this easily for XP.
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:13.560]   So what's happening is it's like a tube of butter that you're squeezing.
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:16.360]   Microsoft's it's coming out between the fingers.
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:18.360]   That's a very bad analogy.
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:19.560]   I'm making it sick.
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:26.400]   Although, for example, Microsoft, remember they previewed Monad, the advanced command
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:32.600]   line interpreter for Vista, and five viruses were created immediately, so they've removed
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:36.200]   Monad from the initial release.
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.920]   So here again, it's going to be left once they get Vista out.
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:42.440]   The door, the arrow in glass.
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:46.200]   And some file formatting or some file structure changes.
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:50.960]   It's going to be search, arrow, glass, and virtual folders.
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:54.560]   You're doing with PCMag, you're doing a round table on Vista on the beta.
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.600]   Has that happened yet or is that happening next week?
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:57.600]   Next week.
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.160]   That's going to be very interesting.
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.680]   Can you give us a preview of a pattern?
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:07.040]   Well, essentially the PCMag team like descended on Windows Vista as if they were a plague
[00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:10.360]   of hungry little locus and just tore it apart.
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.880]   Michael Miller is going to be on talking about what they found in the summarizing.
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:16.120]   Then I'm going to do a video walkthrough of it.
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:20.800]   The irony is this is the beta, but as we can tell, it's going to be changing pretty.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:24.640]   Well, they mean Steve brings it up like the Monad tool.
[00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:28.720]   It takes that three to 36 hours later.
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:33.920]   It's been whacked by a very large stick, and they decide they're going to remove it.
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:35.560]   They've been removing stuff successfully.
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:40.760]   At this point, it's almost like a Windows Vista by a commitment to an entirely well-as-somewhat
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:40.760]   different well-as-somewhat-different well-as-somewhat-somewhat-somewhat-somewhat-somewhat-somewhat-somewhat-somewhat-somewhat-somewhat-somewhat-somewhat-somewhat-somewhat-somewhat-somewhat-somewhat-somewhat-somewhat-somewhat-somewhat-somewhat-somewhat-somewhat-somewhat-somewhat-somewhat-somewhat-somewhat-somewhat-somewhat-somewhat-somewhat-somewhat-somewhat-somewhat-somewhat-somewhat-somewhat-somewhat-somewhat-somewhat-somewhat-somewhat-somewhat
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:14:00.880]   different.
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:24.400]   It's a very interesting thing.
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:31.400]   Well, I don't know why we're writing because people were cutting.
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:35.520]   This is a $50 I book that the school district in Virginia was giving away.
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:36.520]   Did you see the video?
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:37.520]   It was like crazy.
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:40.080]   There were baby strollers that were just mangled.
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:43.080]   People were taking out in stretchers.
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.320]   They brought in the SWAT team in right gear.
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:46.320]   That's the theory.
[00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.320]   It happens all the everyone's.
[00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.120]   I mean, this happens for a good close.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:53.840]   This will happen for a Star Trek release of the Ever-Doh would do another one.
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:58.800]   I say again, I don't think it'll ever happen for a four-year-old in Speron.
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.800]   I bet you it would.
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:01.800]   Let's try it.
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:02.800]   No.
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:03.800]   Okay, come to the...
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:07.840]   Not for one, but if you said you had a thousand or fifty bucks, maybe you're right.
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:11.640]   I mean, there's so many better ways to do it, and they didn't.
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:12.800]   No, no, no, no.
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:13.960]   I think they had no idea.
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:18.240]   But the fact that people were posting on my message board here in California, and you
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:22.480]   had to be a resident of the county to get this, tells you that they got more interested.
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.480]   Why is that a little auction?
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:25.480]   Well, for example.
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:26.960]   Yeah, well, it seems kind of obvious.
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:30.880]   Auction sites are restrictive to people who don't have access to credit cards or access
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:31.880]   to the internet.
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:32.880]   That's right.
[00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:35.120]   They need the laptop in order to log on to the auction site.
[00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.120]   The auction site.
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:40.200]   But just not even just an auction auction.
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:41.440]   Like, just do a raffle.
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:42.440]   You can not even...
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:45.880]   Well, fundamentally, the problem is they said we've got a thousand of these notebooks.
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:47.840]   We're going to sell them for fifty dollars.
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.440]   You know, everybody's like, "It's an i-book.
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.440]   It must be better.
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:51.440]   It's got the Macintosh.
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.440]   It's a computer.
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.440]   It's got the $50 hot damn.
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:57.600]   Hey, if that's the case, how come the Macintosh doesn't have more market share?
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:58.600]   I mean, this is the whole thing.
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.600]   That's a good point.
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.600]   Because they don't sell enough $50 notebooks, John.
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.600]   You know the price point.
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:06.360]   I mean, but at the same price point, how come they don't have more market share?
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:11.480]   I explained this, by the way, in last week's market watch column as an example of a certain
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:15.440]   phenomenon taking place in the American psyche as we speak.
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:16.440]   Check it out, folks.
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:23.440]   I thought we weren't supposed to be so that you wrote a book.
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:27.000]   I wrote an incredibly engaging column describing this exact phenomenon.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   One of the best.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.840]   If you send me twenty five dollars, I will send you a compact guess with the information
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:33.840]   on it.
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:34.840]   I should.
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:35.840]   We're going to try...
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:38.840]   Steve and I are going to try something with this new security podcast.
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:41.640]   They're about twenty minutes each, so we can get four on one CD.
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:42.640]   We're going to go to Lulu.
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.400]   Remember we had Bob Young-On from Lulu.
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:48.440]   It's the... you print it yourself.
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.080]   They charge $550 for the CD.
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.640]   We'll charge $10.
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:52.640]   We'll put four of them.
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:53.880]   It'll be... and we'll just do a set.
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:54.880]   We'll see.
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:55.880]   I'll be very interested to see...
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:57.440]   Look, everybody's trying different models.
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:58.840]   We're not trying to make money on the thing.
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.520]   No, you're not trying to make money.
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:01.520]   You just want to do a dead-ass.
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.960]   You can sort of make a cafe press model, right?
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.240]   Let me tell you how much I make from Cafe Press.
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.240]   Every each and every month without fail.
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:09.240]   $37.
[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:12.040]   I'm telling you, I know we're not going to make a lot of money on this job.
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:13.640]   It's got weeks lattes covered.
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.640]   But I keep strong stuff against the wall.
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:20.120]   If one of them works, then we'll know that we've got a model.
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:22.320]   Do you still have the Lulu port boxers?
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:24.240]   Boxers, hell, I've got thongs.
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.240]   Oh, you did?
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.240]   I'm a bass on them.
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.240]   Oh, I could just see the end.
[00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:31.280]   The boxers are so better than the thongs.
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:33.320]   Not a lot of guys wear thongs.
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:37.800]   Speaking of which, do you see that looking at porn makes you go blind?
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:38.800]   What?
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:39.800]   Briefly.
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:40.800]   Blind.
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.440]   They did this test, Yale University researcher.
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:47.680]   They had people look at slides and describe the slides following.
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:50.120]   They had a variety of slides.
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:54.440]   They were not able to remember the following slides at all when there was a pornographic
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.600]   or violent image.
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:58.440]   Apparently, the brain takes some time to process these images.
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.440]   To recover from it.
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:00.440]   Exactly.
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:01.440]   That's precisely right.
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.440]   They were cut.
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:03.440]   That's what they're just still thinking about it.
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:04.440]   Oh, baby.
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:05.440]   It's exactly right.
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:06.440]   What?
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:07.440]   What's that?
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:08.440]   Oh, oh.
[00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:09.440]   So, model go back?
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:10.440]   It does make you go blind.
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:15.240]   What about they growing the hair on the palm of your hands?
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.760]   Scientists are working on that right now at Texas A&M.
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:18.760]   That's the best part about watching kids.
[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:21.760]   I'd be happy if I could grow on the top of my head.
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:22.760]   No kidding.
[00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:26.160]   What do I have to do to have that happen?
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.160]   Jeans.
[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.880]   We could tell you, but this is a family podcast.
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:32.160]   So Linus is trademarking Linux.
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.800]   It's about time.
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:35.800]   Funny that he never did.
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.240]   I think it's over.
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:39.240]   He's trying.
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:40.800]   I think it's a lost cause.
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.800]   I think it's crazy.
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:46.440]   I mean, he has a copyright just by virtue of doing it.
[00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:49.600]   What would the trademark mean would nobody else could use it without licensing it from
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:50.600]   him?
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.840]   In other words, you can't start calling it good new Linux.
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.840]   It's all about Richard Stallman.
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.160]   No, that's the rationale.
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:58.160]   I'm all for it.
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.520]   Can I tell Richard Stallman's story?
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:01.520]   Please do.
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:04.080]   Richard Stallman, just so people know, is he one of the original MIT hackers who created
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.560]   the Free Software Foundation and the GPL license.
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:09.360]   And much of the software that we think of as being Linux.
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.360]   Yeah.
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:11.360]   That's right.
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:12.360]   That's right.
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:13.360]   That's why I told you and that's why Richard wants you to call it good new Linux.
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:14.360]   Anyway, it's quite a character.
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:15.360]   It's quite a character.
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:16.360]   It's quite a character.
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:17.360]   It's quite a character.
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.360]   Yeah, he's kind of a crazy character.
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:23.640]   He's a nice enough guy, but he's kind of an ethical one a funny way.
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.680]   But anyway, so we're going to have him on Silicon Spin as a guest.
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:30.440]   And so he signed him up and he would have been a good guest because it was going to be a
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:35.000]   controversial show about Linux and it was going to really promote his ideas.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.560]   But he made this edict that we couldn't have him on the show or he wouldn't do the show
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:46.560]   unless everyone on the show agreed in advance to only refer to Linux as good new Linux.
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:47.560]   Oh my goodness.
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:51.440]   And I'm telling you, this was going to be a show that was going to highlight him and
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:55.280]   what he was about and what we were trying to do and the importance of it and all the
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:56.280]   rest of it.
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:00.520]   But he refused to do the show because of this one little thing.
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:03.280]   And I thought that from then it was just this guy's nuts.
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.280]   I mean, this is ridiculous.
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:08.480]   Well, there's a code out of the story because on the screensavers, we agreed and we put
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:09.480]   him on.
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:12.160]   But that's the difference between a roundtable show.
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:13.160]   You can't tell your guests.
[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:14.680]   No, I can't tell people what to say.
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.480]   But Patrick and I said, yeah, we'll call it the new Linux to heaven.
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.480]   But then you know what we did.
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:19.720]   We kind of got a little revenge.
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:24.240]   And actually the reason for the revenge is Richard kind of was hitting on every female
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.000]   on the staff.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.520]   And so with the bad.
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.160]   I don't remember that.
[00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.360]   Good to talk to some of the women.
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.160]   So you've seen him?
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:37.760]   I mean, he's sort of like, you know, I have a lot of respected numbers.
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:40.280]   He's a sort of a scare Santa Claus.
[00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:41.280]   Look at me.
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:44.800]   One thing you can always get Richard because he doesn't understand something.
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:48.280]   He like there's this free software theme song that he likes to sing.
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:52.080]   And he doesn't realize that it's kind of goofy when you sing it.
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:53.960]   So we asked him to sing it and he's saying it.
[00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:54.960]   It was very funny.
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:57.160]   It was kind of mean.
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:59.160]   But we got our revenge.
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:02.160]   We got our revenge.
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:09.040]   But you know, Suzanne Vega saying, you know, Tom's diner, a cappella, that wasn't mean.
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:10.040]   Yeah.
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.040]   Well, what's he the finger?
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:12.880]   Maybe there's a difference.
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:15.640]   I feel so dirty.
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:16.880]   You didn't know we did that.
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:17.880]   No.
[00:21:17.880 --> 00:21:18.880]   I didn't know why.
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:19.880]   You didn't know why we made him.
[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:20.880]   So I didn't make him sing.
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.160]   I just said, Richard, would you sing?
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.880]   And he said, I'd love to.
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.680]   He's got a lot of hair.
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:27.440]   It was like the Merv Griffin show.
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:30.640]   We also mean, you know, to say a couple of nice things about Stalman.
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.280]   He is the source of a tremendous--
[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:33.680]   We owe him hugely.
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:34.680]   Yes.
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:38.600]   I mean, is it safe to say he's pretty much the source of the entire public license?
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:40.800]   Or the inspiration of the GBL?
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:41.800]   Yes, GBL.
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:42.800]   He's the father.
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:46.920]   He keeps the tools we use on the open source versions of Linux.
[00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:51.400]   There's something about many of these open source guys, though, like Eric Raymond.
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.400]   They're characters.
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:53.400]   They're iconic class.
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.840]   They're odd to say the--
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.120]   You have to be.
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:58.120]   I guess so.
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:21:59.120]   They're odd, cool.
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:03.680]   Well, they said we're not going to make any money on this, much like I've said many times.
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.160]   Of course, they're interested in the urban open source.
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.160]   Yes, but they're saying it.
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:09.880]   They're doing it ahead of a sense of opening things up for the world.
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:14.240]   When we say it, it's because we're ironic and cynical.
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:16.560]   You really can't make money off.
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:17.800]   Speaking of making money, wait.
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:18.320]   Yes.
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.400]   I have a question.
[00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:24.560]   Who here is deeply fascinated by Google taking advantage of the insane stock price
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:31.920]   to sell off $14 million in shares for approximately $4 billion.
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.720]   That's still getting up.
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:35.040]   Still raining at $500.
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:36.080]   No, I was watching.
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:40.000]   If anybody out there-- and in fact, I'm blogging this on Monday morning, by the way.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.520]   Devorak.com/blog.
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:42.960]   If it--
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:44.560]   Devorak.org.
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:46.320]   Sorry, I almost screwed it up.
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.040]   Although you could get the other way.
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:49.040]   You get a free one.
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:50.040]   Devorak.org/blog.
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:53.680]   Anyway, Jim Kramer showed mad money.
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:56.480]   It's probably one of the greatest shows ever to appear on television.
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:58.080]   How does this guy go on TV, though?
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.400]   Didn't he get in trouble for--
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:00.720]   Have you watched this show?
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:01.320]   Oh, he's great.
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:01.680]   I love him.
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:02.320]   He's a character.
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.840]   He's a-- he's ranting.
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:10.160]   He did the math and indicated Google even after this deal based on its growth rate and
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:13.320]   the way people normally project these things.
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:17.640]   Although I'm not in agreement with-- I have written that I think it could hit $500.
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.880]   But he says he could see it hitting $900.
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:20.840]   Jeez.
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:24.280]   And I think the stock's got a lot of legs.
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:28.880]   And until it stops growing, which I don't see it happening anytime soon, this stock is
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.640]   just going to keep going up.
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:34.960]   I don't buy tech stock because I keep thinking Jim Lauterbeck is going to come hit me.
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:38.160]   But he was the keeper of the flame at 10.
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:40.160]   But there's some reasons those rules are in effect.
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.160]   I think they're good rules.
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:44.200]   And I continue not to buy tech stock now because I'm afraid.
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.920]   But don't you think that the rug could be pulled out at any time?
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:50.280]   I mean, yeah, Google, if everything continues as is.
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:51.880]   But what if somebody comes up with a better way?
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:53.880]   Don't you think everybody would switch?
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:59.320]   No, but even when Google came out or we saw Altavista and the rest of them come out one
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:02.920]   after another, they don't show up out of the blue.
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:08.080]   Google was lingering and lurking for years and years before all of a sudden it made this
[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:09.080]   move.
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.080]   We don't see anything.
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:13.800]   I mean, if you can show me something that could unseat Google, it's going to be out
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:14.800]   there for us to see right now.
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:16.760]   And we're going to unseat them in the future.
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:17.760]   There is nothing.
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:20.840]   There have been a number of sites to say the next Google tail, whatever happened to them.
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:21.840]   Yeah, well, that's the point.
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:23.680]   Do you think that you'd use them for a while?
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:24.680]   You go, this sucks.
[00:24:24.680 --> 00:24:25.680]   It stinks.
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:26.680]   When all Russia--
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:27.680]   When all Russia--
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:28.680]   I think stinks.
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:29.680]   There was a Russian member clusti.
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:30.680]   Yeah, lefty.
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:31.680]   It's lefty.
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:32.680]   Bad name.
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:33.680]   Yeah, a lefty, whatever you want to go.
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:34.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:35.680]   I know where you're going.
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:38.240]   Well, I think it's not just about standard search anymore either.
[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:41.520]   I mean, they're building a collection of different services from the mapping services
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:42.520]   to the email.
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:43.520]   And the mapping services.
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:44.520]   So that's the question.
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:45.520]   Everything.
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.120]   Google already has something like $3 billion in the bank.
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:50.120]   They're getting another $4 billion in selling this additional stock.
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.120]   What are they going to buy?
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:52.120]   What do they want?
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:53.120]   It's not even that.
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.560]   They're taking a lesson from Microsoft.
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:58.360]   If you have billions in a war chest, it's a lot easier to cover your ass if anything
[00:24:58.360 --> 00:24:59.360]   goes wrong.
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.160]   So they say it's an acquisition.
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.720]   That's for acquisition purposes.
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:05.640]   Well, they're also-- I mean, the leather rumor about Google that was all over the place
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:11.560]   this week was that they were going to start their own free Wi-Fi, their nationwide free
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:12.560]   blog Wi-Fi network.
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:13.560]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:15.480]   Because they're all that dark fiber.
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:16.480]   And I don't know.
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:19.480]   They plan on launching an instant messaging service soon here.
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:20.480]   That's the other one.
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:21.480]   Yeah.
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:22.480]   It's kind of funny.
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:26.280]   It's just this rolling day taunt between Yahoo and--
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:27.280]   [PHONE RINGING]
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:29.120]   If one does something, the other one has to do.
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.120]   I believe we lost--
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:32.120]   I'm just playing around.
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:33.720]   No, I have to start the-- it's apparently--
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:34.720]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:35.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:36.720]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:37.720]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:40.480]   Can we mention VoIP usage is on the rise?
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:43.800]   I think, you know, listen, we're going to talk about crazy companies.
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:48.600]   What is Yahoo doing spending $1 billion on a risky Chinese adventure?
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:50.600]   I mean, while Google's taking money in, Yahoo--
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:51.600]   But look what Yahoo's--
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:52.920]   --indorically to be able to do this.
[00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:54.120]   Look at broadcast.com.
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:55.120]   They've wasted--
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.120]   Well, that was ridiculous.
[00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:57.760]   Money, time, and time again.
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:58.920]   Mark Cuban's driving me crazy.
[00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.560]   As if this guy did anything brilliant.
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:01.560]   I know.
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:04.760]   The only thing brilliant he did was he, you know, stumbled into $5 billion.
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:05.760]   Let me tell you something.
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.760]   I'll call that-- that's lucky.
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:08.760]   You know what?
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:09.760]   Luck, brilliance.
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:10.760]   It's all about taking--
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.960]   He found somebody stupid enough to pay $5 billion for a car.
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:17.200]   He sold instead of sitting on it because it was going to be worth $25 billion in three
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.200]   years.
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.200]   That's the one that's pretty--
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:20.200]   --that's the lead exponent of smarts.
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:23.800]   I think he did because he wanted to be able to buy the Mavericks and yell and scream and
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:24.800]   chop his feet.
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.600]   Well, he's obviously enjoying himself.
[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:27.600]   He's having a good time.
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:28.600]   I'm not knocking him.
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:32.160]   Well, he's got the HD thing going to, which is interesting.
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:33.160]   Interesting.
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:34.160]   That's about it.
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:36.160]   I said the word interesting.
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:37.160]   Interesting.
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:39.040]   So how did this come up?
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:40.040]   I forgot.
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:41.040]   We were talking about, like, looking at--
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:42.040]   A flusoll eagle.
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:43.040]   Yeah, he's googled.
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:44.040]   I think it's a sort of re-wife on network.
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.400]   The reason Yahoo buys China is look what their strategy has been.
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:54.000]   Very successful is the partnering with-- in Dokomo in Japan, SBC in the States.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.360]   They're the big internet service provider for both those companies.
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:59.320]   That's been-- I think they're number one smart strategy that they've done.
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:00.880]   They are the portal in Japan.
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:05.160]   They are the portal for all SBC customers, guaranteeing you millions and millions of page
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.560]   views a day.
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:07.560]   That's a smart move.
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:08.560]   I think they want to do the same thing in China.
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:09.560]   It'll be working for them.
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:13.360]   I talked to somebody today who said that the last time they were at Yahoo, it was nuts.
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:14.360]   They're going crazy.
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:15.800]   They're working long hours.
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:18.360]   They are trying to grab the brass ring right now.
[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:20.600]   They see this as their big opportunity.
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:22.480]   Their hope is not going to happen.
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.480]   You don't think so?
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:27.840]   Google engineers are saying that they believe Yahoo's search returns better results than
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:28.840]   Google is.
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:29.840]   Wow.
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:30.840]   Really?
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:31.840]   I haven't been any evidence of that.
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:32.840]   Me neither.
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:33.840]   Well, they're using--
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:37.880]   They dumped Google and they use Nkutomi now, or Nkutomi, right?
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:39.360]   No, they acquired Nkutomi while in there.
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:40.760]   But that's what their engine is now.
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:42.560]   Nkutomi instead of the Google engine.
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:45.480]   I don't think Nkutomi was ever that good.
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:48.000]   Well, it was for a moment.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.760]   So it was out to Vista for a moment.
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:52.880]   During that one, there was a directory when Hottop was actually the top.
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:54.440]   I thought it was the best search engine now.
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.200]   And then all the web was good, too.
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:57.760]   Well, all the web is a meta.
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:58.760]   That doesn't count, right?
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:27:59.760]   No, no.
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:00.760]   All the web is not a meta.
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:03.160]   It's a genuine-- but their own search.
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:04.160]   Free-standing search.
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.160]   It used to be called something else originally.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:07.160]   Fast.
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:08.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:09.160]   That's the technology they use.
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:10.560]   So is all the web still good?
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:12.640]   It's weed and there's something like that.
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:13.640]   Is all the web still good?
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:15.040]   I mean, is there anything better than Google?
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:16.040]   No.
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.040]   No.
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.960]   How does Google do it?
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:21.800]   They have a clean white page.
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:23.680]   They're on the higher line of engineers.
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:24.680]   It is.
[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:25.680]   It is.
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:26.680]   I mean, look at the Yahoo page.
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:27.680]   Even if Yahoo worked out, I wouldn't use it.
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:29.440]   You know, it hurts you to open that page.
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.240]   It's like, oh, you got to be clean.
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.440]   It did used to be clean.
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:34.200]   And then they went somewhere.
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:36.880]   Wired Magazine has a very-- I recommend it to anybody this month.
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:40.760]   They have a year by year history, the last 10 years of the internet.
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:45.560]   And a great picture of Philo and Yang and of Sean Fanning.
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:47.280]   I mean, some great pictures.
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:51.160]   It's amazing what's happened in just 10 years.
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.960]   It's lifetime.
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:54.880]   It's like future shock, baby.
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:57.280]   I mean, I was older than you, Patrick, 10 years ago.
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:00.440]   And you still are, ironically.
[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:04.240]   You mean that picture I have in the attic hasn't done a thing, huh?
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:05.240]   No, Dorian.
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:08.040]   If Adi, you'd look really traumatized.
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:10.200]   You know, I just had a Yahoo search for my name.
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:11.960]   I just look any better than Google.
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.640]   I'm not that impressed.
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:18.880]   Try a Leola port podcast and see what the difference is between Google and Yahoo.
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:20.360]   And let me tell you something else.
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:26.160]   You know, one of the things I do in my blog, Devorg.org/blog, is that I run a lot of
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.160]   that program.
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:28.920]   And you can see the number of bots that come through.
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:31.000]   They'll look at your index.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   Bots.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.720]   Google has 10 times as many bots as Yahoo.
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:35.960]   Yahoo is actually third.
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:39.320]   I mean, it's mostly Google, then MSN and then Yahoo.
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:41.280]   And they're both of those are way down at the bottom.
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:44.600]   They don't have enough worms or crawlers out there.
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:45.600]   Spiders.
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:46.600]   No worms.
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:47.600]   Don't say the worm.
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:48.600]   Don't say the worm.
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:50.720]   I, you know, I do actually look at the same stats.
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:54.560]   And I'm amazed at the number of crawlers that I don't know anything about that are crawling
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:58.080]   and downloading hundreds of megabytes every month from me.
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:29:59.080]   Sometimes gigabytes.
[00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:00.560]   Who are these people?
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:03.000]   What are they looking at me for?
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   Sometimes jigga watts.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.160]   Well, I'll give you an exam just running the stats on right now on thisweekintech.com.
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:10.160]   Did I say that?
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:11.160]   Thisweekintech.com, right?
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:14.560]   You know, people usually have already gone there to get to the podcast.
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:15.560]   Oh, yeah, that's right.
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:16.560]   They already know.
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:18.800]   I don't have to tell them as you do with the vorac.org/blog.
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:22.920]   Yeah, let's just talk the whole gooling self-promoting right now.
[00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:25.440]   I learned everything I know from this man, John Cena.
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:27.440]   I'm not saying he's not at his feet.
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:32.960]   Okay, Google, when you put just Leo podcast, Google throws it right at the top.
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:35.000]   Not Yahoo.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   Not Yahoo.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.360]   You know, the New York Times is going to write another article about this podcast next week.
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:46.500]   And then they're going to talk about some self-promotion to vanity searches, comparing
[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:49.040]   vanity searches to get used for a podcast.
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:52.280]   And if none of the New York Times reporters ever do a vanity search.
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:55.200]   Yes, but they'll never talk about it in print, you see.
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:56.440]   Yeah, I have the same thing.
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:01.080]   I have Google Box number one, MSN bot is number two, then unknown robot identified by crawl
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:04.960]   is number three, then ink to me slurp, which is presumably Yahoo slurp.
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.480]   I like some of the stuff MSN is doing.
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:08.320]   Have you tucked out their sandbox?
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:10.760]   Their little start.com thing they're working on?
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:11.760]   No, tell me about that.
[00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:12.760]   Take a look at this.
[00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:13.760]   It's been out for a while though, hasn't it?
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:14.760]   Isn't that old?
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:15.760]   They've been sitting on it forever.
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:19.840]   No, no, this is a new, because of Yahoo's homepage and Google's homepage, they're trying
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:21.640]   to do a kind of my MSN.
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:24.640]   Yeah, but it's all Ajax and it's all pretty, you can drag and drop.
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:26.200]   That's like the Google.
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.200]   What is Ajax?
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.200]   Is that that technology?
[00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:31.000]   Yeah, it's basically a combination of it's like, what did they used to call it?
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   It's an XML HTTP.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   It allows you to do like really cool dynamic stuff.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.120]   You can drag and drop stuff around, move it around.
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:41.200]   My perspective had practically invented that, so it's ironic that Google scooped them on
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.800]   that, but it's good they can do it now.
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:43.800]   That's pretty cool.
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.120]   It works with all browsers, right?
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:46.120]   Yeah.
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:47.120]   That's kind of amazing.
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:49.560]   It's nice because a lot of the stuff that you used to require like a hard refresh to
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:52.160]   a page can now be done directly within the page without having to--
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:55.320]   That's the same thing with the Google start page, IG, where you can drag things around.
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:56.320]   Exactly.
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:57.320]   I love that.
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:58.320]   How popular are they?
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:31:59.720]   I use Google IG as my homepage.
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:00.720]   You bet.
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:03.400]   But, Dvorak, you have your own custom start page.
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:04.400]   I have a portal page.
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:06.240]   Which is starting to look at home with that HTML.
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:09.400]   It's starting to look more and more like the label of a Dr. Bronner's Peppermint soap
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:10.400]   bar.
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:15.280]   Well, the problem with it is I think the days-- I did this thing years ago as a text-only
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:16.680]   page, so it would load real fast.
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:20.960]   I think the days of that as we approach, I think Canada has announced that they've hit
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:21.960]   full saturation.
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:26.480]   This is a new story we didn't cover, but it was about a week or two ago that the Canadians
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:32.320]   say saturation for broadband, everybody agrees with 75% of the population.
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:34.520]   And Canada appears to have hit it.
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:35.520]   Really?
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:36.520]   75%.
[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:37.520]   We're close though.
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:38.520]   We're almost 60%.
[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:39.520]   Yeah, a lot of high-fills.
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:40.520]   A lot of high-fills right now.
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:41.520]   They expect to hit it.
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:43.720]   We expect to hit it in the next two years.
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:47.720]   When it happens, there's no reason to have these slow-loading pages or these fast-loading
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:48.720]   pages.
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:51.040]   You might as well go forward with everything.
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:56.240]   Hey, John, did you catch any of the articles this week that suggested that the FCC's
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:33:00.120]   estimations of broadband penetration in the US were kind of bogus?
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:05.360]   No, but I've always felt that the FCC's definition of broadband was kind of bogus.
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:06.360]   How are they defining it?
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:10.760]   Well, depending on who you talk to, it's anywhere from 300k to a megabit, and they
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:13.320]   don't say much more about anything faster.
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:15.600]   And to me, broadband begins that a megabit.
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:16.600]   I agree.
[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:17.600]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:20.440]   Although, if you have dial-up, 300k sounds pretty fun.
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:22.160]   I remember I was happy with ISDN.
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:23.160]   It's at the 120.
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:24.160]   The ISDN was great.
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:29.280]   Especially if you were in a part of a city where they had incredibly bad copper.
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:31.080]   ISDN was a miracle.
[00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:32.080]   I was not really about this.
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:33.080]   I think John's exactly right, though.
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:36.840]   By definition, DSL is not broadband.
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:37.840]   Because it's too fast.
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:38.840]   Too slow.
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:40.400]   Well, that's the most version you've got.
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:43.640]   The American version of DSL is too slow.
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:44.640]   Right.
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:45.640]   We should have...
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:49.920]   They've been talking about X DSL and V DSL and all these high-speed DSLs.
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:56.360]   And 99.
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.360]   And where are these things?
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:00.360]   They've never put them in place.
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:03.360]   And the thing that really galles me the most is the phone companies are always hinting
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:07.720]   that if, well, you know, if North Point and all these competitors get off of our lines,
[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:09.520]   we can put these bright boosters on.
[00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:12.520]   We can push the signal out a lot further than jack up the rate.
[00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:14.560]   So we're not subsidizing these other guys.
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:18.920]   Why should we be upping the ante for everybody when they're just poachers sitting on our
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:19.920]   own DSL?
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:20.920]   It's all BS.
[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:24.800]   Somebody says Cisco's sitting on a DSL that is multi-multi-multi-megabit.
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:27.280]   That's just 100-megabit DSL that they're not...
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:28.280]   They've got...
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:29.280]   They're just sitting on it.
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:30.280]   Oh.
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:31.280]   100-megabit.
[00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:32.280]   That doesn't sound right.
[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:33.280]   I don't think you can do that over the top.
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:34.280]   Somebody's nodding.
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:35.280]   Not at this.
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:36.280]   Somebody in this room is nodding.
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:37.280]   But then I'm like, no.
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:39.920]   Somebody who can't say anything is whispering in Kevin's ear.
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:40.920]   I'm...
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:43.440]   You know, they may be something that works in the lab.
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.680]   I mean, this is difficult.
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:46.720]   I mean, there's a lot of cool stuff that works in the lab.
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:50.720]   You put it in the field and one squirrel gets on the line the next season so you've got
[00:34:50.720 --> 00:34:51.720]   nothing.
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:52.720]   Damn squirrels.
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:54.200]   It's all about the squirrels.
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:55.200]   Hey, you laugh.
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:58.680]   But when we had the copper replaced, when the copper finally physically, the copper in
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:03.480]   my friend's house, which is put in in the 40s, squirrels love copper, it finally completely
[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:05.120]   rotted through, corroded through.
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:06.120]   Yeah.
[00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:07.120]   Clothraft copper.
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:08.120]   Well, yeah.
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:10.080]   Clothraft copper, the cloth that disintegrated, the copper was rotting through.
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:13.480]   At one point I was using a pair of vise grips to bridge one of the breaks in it because at
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:14.480]   the point...
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:17.640]   You know, we were waiting for 9X to show up.
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:20.800]   You think I got to use a copper penny on a fuse to reuse it, aren't you?
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:21.800]   No.
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:22.800]   No.
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:23.800]   But it's gripping off the wire.
[00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:27.160]   I know, well, the particular wiring question was on the side of the house.
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:28.880]   It was about five feet off the ground.
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:29.880]   Hey, look, if you're waiting...
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:32.320]   Hey, we were waiting for somebody to call back.
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:33.920]   We were waiting for a client to call back.
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:38.040]   If the client called back and we weren't there, we were not going to get the gig, okay?
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.040]   It was money.
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:40.040]   We needed it.
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.480]   I'm here, but just as long as the vise grip holds.
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:45.840]   The high-neck shows up like four days later, they look at the copper, they're like, "Wow,
[00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:47.680]   we can't believe we should fall apart sooner."
[00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:51.440]   They replace it, our web connection went up like 20K.
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:52.440]   Is the future fios?
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:54.720]   This fiber that Verizon's putting in, this is amazing.
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:55.720]   Do you have any idea?
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:57.720]   They get fired into your curb and then they put ethernet.
[00:35:57.720 --> 00:35:58.720]   How do you have anything?
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:35:59.720]   They put ethernet.
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:01.200]   Who's going to take a hold of every curb?
[00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:02.200]   They're putting it.
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:03.600]   They're in like 40 cities now.
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:04.600]   40 cities.
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:05.600]   Which 40 cities?
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:06.600]   What percentage of the cities?
[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:10.000]   They didn't finish wiring Brooklyn for cable until the late '90s.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.200]   A lot of the LA area, Providence is wired.
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.200]   They've got fiber to the curb.
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:15.280]   It's 50 bucks.
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:19.160]   You get seven megabits down, you get a megabit up.
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:23.280]   And they've fiber to the curb and then they put a hundred megabit ethernet into your house.
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:25.840]   Which sounds great, but it's the same problem we've had with every--
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:27.240]   It's rolling out very quickly.
[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:30.920]   Well, I'm with Norton on this one.
[00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:32.240]   I don't see any evidence of it.
[00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:36.280]   I think there's just popping up here and there, especially with new developments, but I don't
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:38.120]   think we're going to be getting it anytime soon.
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:39.120]   Oh, I agree with you.
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:40.120]   I agree with you.
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:44.600]   Those of you who live in densely populated urban areas with rundown buildings.
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:47.760]   I don't live in a density of urban areas right now.
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:49.600]   He just lives in a room.
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:55.160]   Just because John and I agree, he lives in the pathetic housing situation that I do.
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:58.400]   But in my area, where everything's underground, I don't think it's going to be that big a
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:36:59.400]   deal.
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.560]   It costs a lot of money to pull the fiber.
[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:01.560]   They're going to pull the fiber.
[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:04.200]   Yeah, I mean, it takes time and it takes money.
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:06.280]   Oh, they amortize it out over 30 years, right?
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:07.280]   Yeah.
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:11.240]   Well, there are cable industry was built over basically writing off the cost of upgrading.
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:13.000]   So why is Verizon touting it?
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.280]   Why are they doing it if they don't plan?
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:16.680]   I mean, what's you're saying this is political?
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:17.680]   Political.
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:20.040]   Yeah, that's a good show.
[00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:21.040]   You can put on a good show.
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:22.040]   Look what we're doing.
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:23.040]   Look what we're doing.
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.320]   Let us do our own thing.
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:26.200]   We need to get like they did in Pennsylvania.
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:30.040]   We need to be able to tell the metropolitan areas that they can't put in YMAX.
[00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:31.040]   We need this.
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:32.040]   We need that.
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:33.040]   Oh, so this is it.
[00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:34.040]   This is it.
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:35.040]   Yeah, look at the size of these spools.
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:36.040]   These are huge spools.
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:39.560]   I talked to a guy who spends 100 bucks a month for Fios.
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:41.080]   He's got 80 megabits down.
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:42.080]   I don't know why you'd want it.
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:43.080]   He's a lucky guy.
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:44.080]   You know, let's go move into his house.
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:45.880]   Let's just put a server in there and see how long it lasts.
[00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:47.720]   Well, that's a good point.
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:48.720]   I don't know.
[00:37:48.720 --> 00:37:49.720]   I don't know.
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:50.720]   I'm not fine with the company.
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:51.720]   I'm sorry.
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:53.400]   15 megabits down for $50.
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:55.400]   I tried to sign up for this when I was an L.A.
[00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:56.920]   They said it was only in like one area.
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:38:00.000]   Well, let's just spread more because I do a radio show down there and I talk to people
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   all the time.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   No, let's spread more.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   That's good.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   I don't know.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.600]   I don't know if I can get this that we can talk about it directly.
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:07.600]   I'm not--
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:10.400]   I just want Verizon's cell phone service to work in my own neighborhood.
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:12.400]   Mr. DeVorack, Verizon.
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:13.400]   Mr. DeVorack.
[00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:14.400]   Landshark.
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:15.400]   We have your cable.
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:16.400]   We're outside now.
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:19.240]   There's a couple black cars pulling on.
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:20.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:21.640]   Bonjourne, run.
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:23.240]   Did the security escape?
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:24.240]   I asked her.
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:28.680]   Dean, shall we take some questions from the vast Twitter audience, the Twitter army,
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:29.680]   as they are known?
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:33.120]   Hey, by the way, before we do that, I want to remind everybody, our first live Twitter
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:35.560]   podcast is coming up September 4th, Labor Day weekend.
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:38.280]   We're going to be at the Apple Store in San Francisco.
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:39.760]   We're going to take over the whole place.
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:44.720]   Speaking of riots, they have a nice auditorium there and $50 I books for everybody who comes.
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:45.720]   No, it's the case.
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:46.720]   Don't even suggest that, Leo.
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:48.880]   I thought the first public one was the 11th, Leo.
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:49.880]   It is.
[00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:50.880]   We moved it up.
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:54.560]   The first public one is the 18th at Noonan's, but September 4th, Apple has invited us to
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:55.560]   use the Apple Store.
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:57.280]   There will be no $50 I books.
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:59.240]   Let us make this abundantly clear.
[00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:00.240]   $20 Ipods.
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:02.200]   I got a $5 autograph from Leo.
[00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:03.680]   I'll give you autographs for $5.
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:04.680]   That's cheap.
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:05.680]   Hey.
[00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:06.680]   No, anybody autographs galore.
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:08.840]   Leo will sign anything you've ordered.
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:14.280]   I have ordered 500 pocket protectors, Twitter pocket protectors, which will be free to the
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:15.280]   first 500 people who have made this.
[00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:17.000]   You're going to have to get a shirt with a pocket again.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.840]   See that old ZTV pocket protector?
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:21.880]   I could sell that on eBay for at least $12.
[00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:24.360]   And if you put a sign in, it would sell for at least $7.
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:29.080]   So I've ordered 500 pocket protectors that will say, what should they say on them?
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:30.080]   Twitter army?
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:31.080]   Sure.
[00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:33.680]   I've got something a little cooler than the pocket protectors.
[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:35.360]   What's cooler than a pocket protector?
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:36.520]   I think that's pretty good.
[00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:38.040]   You're with me on this one.
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:41.440]   Actually, I believe the question should be, the question should be, what's cooler than
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:43.960]   a pocket protector that costs less than 71 cents?
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:46.520]   Ah, a little change purse?
[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:47.520]   Okay.
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:49.440]   Okay, I'll get some change purses.
[00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:50.440]   We'll see how many of those.
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:52.440]   You know, I want somebody to use one.
[00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:53.440]   There's a squeeze.
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:54.440]   Yeah, a rubber clamp.
[00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:55.440]   A rubber clamp thing.
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:56.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:57.440]   That's very popular.
[00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:01.000]   We're going to suck at phone calls from like, Hi, I'm Bob from my mal-comated novelties.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.440]   I've got some great items you can use to promote your 71 cents.
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:05.440]   It's a deal.
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:06.440]   Okay.
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:07.440]   Less than 71 cents.
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:08.440]   The pocket protector is in quantity.
[00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:10.440]   How do we get like fans?
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:11.440]   Like they used to get out of memory.
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:13.440]   They'll be fun at all.
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:14.440]   Let me see.
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:15.440]   Is there anybody who's not going to be there?
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:16.440]   You're going to be there right now.
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:19.840]   Because I think if you're not there, we should have a picture of you on a stick and then we
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:21.320]   can have a whole, you're going to be there, right?
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:22.320]   Yeah.
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:23.320]   Patrick's going to be there.
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:24.320]   Devorak, you're going to be there?
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:25.320]   Do you want me to not be there?
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:26.320]   I can stay at home.
[00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:27.320]   I can stay at home.
[00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:28.320]   I can stay at home.
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:29.320]   I'm going to stick my work.
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:30.320]   Yeah.
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:31.320]   Steve Gibson can't be there.
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:32.320]   He's in Irvine.
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:33.880]   And you and I are doing our own thing anyway now, do you?
[00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:34.880]   Oh, yes.
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:35.880]   See now he's moved on.
[00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:37.720]   He's got the number two podcast in the nation.
[00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:38.720]   He's moved on.
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:41.040]   Sounds just like...
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:42.040]   Where is Marty?
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.040]   Maybe...
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:45.040]   Marty, Marty, Marty, Marty, you come in and mark podcasts.
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:46.040]   Marty, we have an invitation for Marty.
[00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:47.600]   And we're going to be at a bar, Marty.
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:48.600]   Well, what more could you ask for?
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:49.600]   A bar?
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:50.600]   He's an L.A.
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:51.600]   He's an L.A.
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:52.600]   He's got a car.
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:53.600]   He's got a good money.
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:54.600]   It's got a good money.
[00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:56.240]   Picture John on a stick and do all his cooler and O'Brien moving mouth thing.
[00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:57.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:58.680]   The clutch cargo thing?
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:00.200]   The problem is we don't have video.
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:01.680]   Roger Chang, you're going to be there?
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:02.680]   Yes.
[00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:03.680]   Okay, so no mask for...
[00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:04.680]   A good, brilliant video.
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:05.680]   Let's do it.
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:06.680]   We'll all have Prager masks.
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:07.680]   No, that's just scary.
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:08.680]   Prager!
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:11.200]   So we'll be in the auditorium at the Apple Store September 4th.
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:16.640]   Please come, the broadcast begins sometime around 4 o'clock in the afternoon and we're
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:17.640]   just going to have a lot of fun.
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:18.640]   And I will have pocket protectors.
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:20.800]   Just remember that parking is expensive.
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:21.800]   It's Tom.
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:22.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:23.800]   Take public transit.
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:24.800]   Bart dumps you right there.
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:28.520]   And even though this show really never says anything, you can see how much fun we're all
[00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:30.520]   having and everybody else will too.
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:35.440]   Well, we don't say anything because we promised to play a guy calling in and we never do
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:36.440]   it.
[00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:38.440]   Hey, let's bring up a lot of questions.
[00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:39.440]   Kylo gaining out of it.
[00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:40.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:41.440]   Listen, I get this guy.
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:43.360]   Who did you say he is?
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:44.360]   He's the wrestler?
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:46.680]   Oh, it sounds like the...
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:47.680]   Not good Will Hunting.
[00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:50.000]   What's the movie with QSAC where he plays a hit band?
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   This is the number one podcast of the nation.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   This is what we brought up.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   We brought a podcast of the nation, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:59.800]   Yeah, I'm Shiloh gaining out of Zamesville, Ohio.
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:00.800]   I was thinking about...
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:02.200]   Hey, I want to hear his name.
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:06.240]   Yeah, I'm Shiloh gaining out of Zamesville, Ohio.
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:11.040]   I was thinking about starting my own web podcast and I was wondering if you knew any place
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:15.480]   where you was able to download bringing music samples without having to pay a royalty.
[00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:16.480]   Thank you very much, Leo.
[00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:17.480]   Ah.
[00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:18.480]   I'm in the gang.
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:20.800]   What do you want to do on a music show?
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:21.800]   Maybe.
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:23.800]   I mean, there is PODS Safe Music.
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:25.400]   Oh, who cares?
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:26.800]   But it's all pretty bad.
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:27.800]   Good.
[00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:28.800]   Oh, P sound.
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:29.800]   Oh, P sound.
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:30.800]   Oh, P sound.
[00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:31.800]   Creative Commons.
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:37.120]   Creative Commons, the thing John loves so much, has a music page of stuff you can use
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:38.120]   in podcasts.
[00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:39.120]   Yeah.
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:40.120]   Oh, fantastic material.
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:42.560]   None of it as good as our fabulous doing the Twit.
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:44.600]   Do you love that?
[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:45.600]   I never heard it.
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:46.600]   Oh, it's great.
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:50.000]   It's Ashly Twit did it for us.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   He's a professional composer.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   It's amazing.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   It's amazing.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   It's at the end of every podcast.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   Here's just a little...
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   D-A-D-A-D-A-D-A-D.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   Okay.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   Sounds like PB yet.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.480]   And his name is Ashly Twit?
[00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:08.480]   Yeah, so he had to do it for us.
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:09.480]   Do it a Twit.
[00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:10.480]   Yeah.
[00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:11.480]   He's doing the Twit.
[00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:12.480]   All right, another question.
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:13.480]   Hi, Twits.
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:18.000]   I'm Jeff with my host from the Netherlands and I'm interested in your opinion on the future
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.960]   of operating systems.
[00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:25.360]   For the last decade and a half, all those interfaces have been either command-formed or women-winning
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:26.360]   systems.
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:27.360]   Is this going to change?
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:32.000]   Are we going to use other input devices that keep what's on mind?
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.480]   Basically, what are operating systems going to look like in 10-20 years?
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:37.480]   All right.
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:40.040]   He's not really asking about operating systems, but user interfaces.
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:41.040]   Yeah, that's what he does.
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:42.040]   How is that going to change?
[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:43.040]   It's not.
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:44.720]   I say it's going to change a lot.
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:45.720]   No.
[00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:46.720]   And I'll tell you why.
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:47.720]   Why?
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:49.920]   This is basically once it's stabilized, it's the way it's like the automobile.
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:53.520]   At some first, they had a stick and they had to deal in the middle and they did this
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:56.240]   and they finally got it together while what an automobile should be like.
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:57.240]   It doesn't have a starter.
[00:43:57.240 --> 00:44:00.000]   It doesn't have a starter button anymore.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   All right.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.560]   Essentially, they've got it together and now that's all they do.
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:04.560]   It's just a little variation.
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:05.560]   I just don't see.
[00:44:05.560 --> 00:44:08.000]   But that took him 40 years, John.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   Have we hit that point?
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.400]   Yeah, I mean the first machines came out in '75, right?
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:12.400]   30 years now.
[00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:13.400]   Yeah.
[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:14.400]   I don't know.
[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:17.680]   It's kind of interesting until somebody figures a way to jack into the back of your skull.
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:22.560]   Jeff Raskin, the late Jeff Raskin, unfortunately, did some really interesting stuff with zooming
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:23.720]   interfaces that I liked.
[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:24.720]   It was not.
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:25.720]   He's always hated windowing.
[00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:29.600]   He doesn't like the idea of encapsulating data in a box.
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:31.000]   And I really liked what he was doing.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   It's called Archie.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.240]   You could see, I'll put a link in the show notes, but the idea there was kind of an infinitely
[00:44:36.240 --> 00:44:37.680]   zoomable desktop.
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:43.040]   So you could dig down into the desktop and have documents in there and zoom into them
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:44.040]   and zoom out.
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:45.040]   I really liked it.
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:51.160]   I think the reason our current desktop works as well as it does is it models the way people
[00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:52.160]   think.
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:55.800]   I mean, we think in terms of documents and in terms of things.
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:58.760]   And I think that the model maps well.
[00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:05.080]   And I really agree with John in much the same way that the Apple II had a word processor
[00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:10.560]   and a spreadsheet that are basically the same as what we have today because we're done.
[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:11.560]   Yeah.
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:12.560]   Yeah.
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:15.320]   It works well for a certain segment of the population.
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:17.960]   There's a lot of people that find the entire interface frustrating.
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:20.920]   But you get into different forms of intelligence.
[00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:23.160]   There's different ways of processing information.
[00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:28.080]   What if for people who are literate and for people who are used to using this paradigm
[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:30.240]   or have been forced into this paradigm, it's not bad?
[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:32.520]   The people who are not are just going to die off.
[00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:33.520]   I mean, literally.
[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:34.520]   Artists can be a scientist.
[00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:36.520]   Are musicians going to die off?
[00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:37.520]   Artists are many.
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:41.560]   These artists are more adept at using these machines than most of us.
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:45.640]   And you watch them die using illustrator and Adobe Photoshop and watch them go through
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:46.640]   the machin.
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:47.640]   Oh, it's amazing.
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:48.640]   Sure.
[00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:51.920]   And it's loaded machine which you usually have an Apple that's got extra processors in it.
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:53.800]   And he says he's not a computer geek.
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:57.200]   I'm thinking, "Holy mack, well, you're like 10 times more than I am."
[00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:58.200]   Yeah.
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:45:59.200]   No, that's true.
[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:01.000]   But in a very narrow, what about voice recognition?
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   Is that, I mean, keyboards are pretty antiquated, couldn't we?
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   Really?
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   Would you like that, John?
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   I'd love voice recognition.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.640]   Well, that's a big difference in the user interface.
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:10.640]   It's not doable.
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:13.880]   Look at us, we can barely understand each other.
[00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:14.880]   What happened?
[00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:16.520]   I totally agree with John.
[00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:19.280]   I think that in fact it's about bandwidth.
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:24.120]   And when you really think about it, in terms of specifying what you want to do, a mouse
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:29.600]   cursor where you're able to move across a service and click icons and drag things and
[00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:34.720]   move things, that's an amazing amount of bandwidth between you and the system that is
[00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:37.000]   like zero, zero error.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:41.400]   If you try to verbally specify the same kind of things, it's a huge nightmare.
[00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:42.960]   Well, all hail Doug Engelbart.
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:44.600]   What happened to voice recognition software?
[00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:48.080]   What happened to the dragon naturally speaking that was so popular way that got out of it?
[00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:49.080]   Scan software.
[00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:50.080]   IBM and Scan software.
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:52.840]   Did IBM sell IBM's via voice to Scan software?
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:55.360]   Scan software owns Dragon and via voice.
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:58.320]   And Microsoft owns the third one, learn out in house B, and that's it.
[00:46:58.320 --> 00:46:59.320]   It's over.
[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:03.000]   Now everybody says IBM's doing a lot of research in China, and if you're going to do it, the
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.800]   one place you would do it would be China where the keyboard doesn't make sense for their
[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:07.800]   written language.
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:10.480]   Have you ever seen one of those like 600 keyboard?
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:11.480]   Yeah, it's my mind.
[00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:12.480]   The more those are amazing.
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:18.440]   But you, so you, Mandarin, de Vorak and Gibson say it ain't going to happen ever?
[00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:21.320]   I think the mouse will get a little more humpy because you know they keep making the
[00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:23.680]   mouse more humpy.
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:26.480]   I think that these things will be added on.
[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:30.480]   I mean again, take a look at the model or the analogy of the car.
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:33.540]   I mean, there's a lot of things that have changed, but we still haven't got a joystick
[00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:35.040]   or fly by wire car.
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:36.040]   Right.
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:37.040]   Well, you're, you're, you're the gun.
[00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:39.200]   But it does, it's not, doesn't work.
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:40.960]   It would be better, wouldn't it?
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:43.000]   No, it works for a plane.
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.920]   No, well, if you think about it, if you had to drive a car with a stick, where would the
[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:47.920]   feedback come from?
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:48.920]   I don't know.
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:49.920]   I don't know.
[00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:53.340]   The plane when you're flying it by a stick, you've got a stick, two pedals and a separate
[00:47:53.340 --> 00:47:54.340]   set of throttles.
[00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:55.340]   You know what I mean?
[00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:57.800]   And you don't have another, and you don't have another plane five feet away from you.
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:58.800]   Yeah.
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:02.240]   It, it, it, that's one of the things I, when I was, when I was, when I talked about this
[00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:05.880]   before, I was in these simulators and there's one that I got in which was the advanced
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:09.080]   flight simulator they have over at, at NASA Ames.
[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:12.600]   And it's a, it's a, it's a fly by wire with a stick that doesn't have all the pedals or
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:13.600]   anything.
[00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:14.600]   It's just basically just a stick.
[00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:17.720]   And it turns out to be really easy and comfortable to fly it.
[00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:19.480]   It's because the computer flies it.
[00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:21.480]   You just turn the direction on the plane or anything.
[00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:22.480]   But it gives you feedback.
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:24.280]   The computer gives you feedback onto the stick.
[00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:25.280]   Thank you.
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:26.280]   They do.
[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:27.280]   It depends on relaxing.
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:28.280]   It's amazing.
[00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:30.080]   Well, it's like that in my car.
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:31.520]   I'd like to relax when I drive.
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:35.200]   They also say you, the, the, there would be so much less traffic and there would be some,
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:37.840]   there, you could be, you could have a much denser.
[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:38.840]   Sorry.
[00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:39.840]   Go ahead.
[00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:40.840]   Keep it turned.
[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:41.840]   Oh, sorry.
[00:48:41.840 --> 00:48:42.840]   Sorry.
[00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:43.840]   Stop him.
[00:48:43.840 --> 00:48:44.840]   Stop.
[00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:45.840]   Stop.
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:46.840]   Okay.
[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:47.840]   Go ahead.
[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:48.840]   Now the, the, the, the research keeps coming out and you look at the numbers or people looking
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:51.840]   at, at automotive traffic and the, uh, automotive density, you can put in the square mile of
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:56.320]   a highway and if we get all the, you know, basically if you drove on the hit a button
[00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:59.680]   and the, you know, the computer started driving you on the highway, you can have a much, much
[00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:01.800]   higher, you know, automotive density.
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:06.400]   My thing, my thing is always been what if one of those people doesn't change the oil
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:08.600]   or doesn't do the regular maintenance of the car.
[00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:09.600]   Yeah.
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:10.960]   The world's worst 80 car pileups.
[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:14.480]   Well, no, it ends up being similar to what happens now except that instead of having a
[00:49:14.480 --> 00:49:18.800]   53 car pileup, the cars, the, you know, the Ford motion sensor sees that the car is slowing
[00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:20.720]   down and that slows everyone behind it now.
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:24.960]   And then they, and then that one car gets thrown off to the side and burnt to a crib.
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:25.960]   As it should be.
[00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:26.960]   Exactly.
[00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:30.600]   Yeah, I was going to say, if you like, I was driving in traffic yesterday and I was like,
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:34.280]   man, if I had a decent bumper on the front of this truck, I'd just stand on it.
[00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:38.440]   Cause you know, there's nothing worse than being behind a $65,000 Porsche car.
[00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:39.440]   Yeah.
[00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:40.440]   But you can do 180 miles an hour.
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:41.440]   But it's not.
[00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:45.120]   And I'm going to do it 55 in the passing lane because I am clueless.
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:46.920]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:49.240]   There's, there's moments where I could really get into the whole letting something else
[00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:50.240]   drive.
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:52.480]   So you have a, you have a, you have a beef.
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:54.880]   I have many beefs, John.
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:56.120]   Not like you.
[00:49:56.120 --> 00:49:57.120]   You have no complaints.
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:58.120]   You too.
[00:49:58.120 --> 00:49:59.120]   You know it's funny.
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:01.120]   You two are closer than you think.
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:04.360]   This is Kevin from ivybrutes.com.
[00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:06.360]   And I was wondering what your thoughts were on IPTV.
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:08.680]   You think it's mainstream yet?
[00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:12.400]   And that it will ever be like broadcast television and become a comments or a cement
[00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:13.400]   attainment.
[00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:17.680]   Also, I know you guys are planning on doing a show in front of a live audience.
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:20.680]   So will we be seeing a video version of the speaking tech?
[00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:21.680]   Thanks.
[00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:22.680]   I love the podcast.
[00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:23.680]   You have the good work.
[00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:24.680]   Well, Kevin should answer this one.
[00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:25.680]   He's the king of IPTV.
[00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:26.680]   I love him at that.
[00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:27.680]   I am.
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:28.680]   I have a publication, IPTVDaily.com.
[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:30.680]   Go check it out.
[00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:31.680]   It's in beta.
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:32.680]   Yeah.
[00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:37.080]   I was going to say to Kevin, first of all, first of all to Kevin, excellent job following
[00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:42.120]   the Dvorak Laport model of self promotion by using your web page rather than your hometown.
[00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:43.120]   Yes.
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:44.120]   Good job.
[00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:45.120]   It was nicely done.
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:46.120]   Yeah.
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:47.120]   Second of all, is it mainstream yet?
[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:48.120]   No, not even close.
[00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:50.120]   You Patrick did your first IPTV broadcast for PC Magazine.
[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:51.120]   Yeah.
[00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:52.120]   And we did our second one.
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:53.120]   It was actually really good.
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:54.120]   I tried to click on it and it wouldn't stream.
[00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:55.120]   Hey, I said the A.
[00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:58.080]   I sent Patrick a note saying it wouldn't stream for me either.
[00:50:58.080 --> 00:50:59.080]   Here's the problem.
[00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:01.480]   What we can't seem to get people to figure out is, and what we're going to have to do
[00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:05.280]   is manually remove the link because the link there is only going to be active when we're
[00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:06.840]   actually broadcasting.
[00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:10.280]   And then we're archiving the shows and making them available off a separate server.
[00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:13.920]   So what we do is we left the link up on the web page and I keep getting these emails
[00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:15.120]   like, dude, it doesn't work.
[00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:16.120]   It's broken.
[00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:17.840]   And the problem is, it's not broken.
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:19.840]   We're just not sending anything out over it.
[00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:22.080]   Oh, that's a good reason to have a link.
[00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:24.240]   It's called a dead link.
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:25.240]   It's broken.
[00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:27.240]   It just doesn't work.
[00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:28.920]   No, it works.
[00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:32.240]   It's just you don't receive anything until we're sending it together.
[00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:33.240]   And great.
[00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:37.000]   You know, we're going to start stalking in like PR marketing speak in a second.
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.360]   There's this thing called an HTML editor.
[00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:41.960]   And you get in there and you can just take that link out.
[00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:44.280]   Actually, ours actually does that.
[00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:49.360]   We actually, when you get to product page, that's because we're just technology.
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:56.360]   You can do it.
[00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:59.360]   You can write that in assembler and it would be 4K.
[00:51:59.360 --> 00:52:02.360]   Well, you know, you already descended my way.
[00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:04.360]   Well, when did you think about IPTV?
[00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:05.360]   Yes, let's get down to that.
[00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:06.360]   And what's that webpage again, John?
[00:52:06.360 --> 00:52:09.360]   IPTVDaily.com as opposed to IPDaily.
[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:12.360]   IPDaily.com is a whole nother site.
[00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:13.360]   Everybody took that one already.
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:15.360]   So anyway, the thing is if you go around anywhere else in the world, in fact, you can see this
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:18.360]   by the number of new stories that come out, that IPTV is already in place.
[00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:21.360]   It's really bump broadcasting over it.
[00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:26.360]   And it's going to be the dominant form of TV distribution in areas that don't have cable
[00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:27.360]   TV.
[00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:29.360]   We're talking about television coming in over the Internet.
[00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:35.360]   And in fact, I saw some good demos of this when I was in Stockholm at the Erickson Research
[00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:41.360]   Facilities and they have IPTV all over Sweden.
[00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:44.360]   And essentially, it looks like you wouldn't know the difference between that and cable.
[00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:49.360]   And they have, of course, 30 megabit per second connections, which helps quite a bit.
[00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:52.360]   Well, that's where broadband penetration and high speed Internet is going to be very important.
[00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:53.360]   You can't.
[00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:54.360]   There's no point in doing it unless you get universal broadband.
[00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:56.360]   No, we've got here and we've got cable TV.
[00:52:56.360 --> 00:52:57.360]   We don't need IPTV.
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:00.360]   But around the world and in China, it's going to be huge.
[00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:03.360]   It's really going to be a dominant form of distribution.
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:08.360]   And what it's going to eventually result in, and I think that's why Kevin's kind of on the right track here
[00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:13.360]   with that system thing they're doing, is that I think it's going to create a lot of mini broadcasters
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:18.360]   that can put up one or two things and just let people get them when they feel like it.
[00:53:18.360 --> 00:53:21.360]   I think that's kind of a bad broadcasting.
[00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:24.360]   The whole thing is that you see a couple of different paths here.
[00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:27.360]   You see the mainstream networks that are kind of jumping on that bandwagon.
[00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:31.360]   You have the SBCs getting ready to deploy the set top boxes.
[00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:36.360]   But it's going to be a while until we can actually push our content to a set top box.
[00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:40.360]   Right now, it's all done through vidcasting where people subscribe to our feed
[00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:43.360]   and automatically download through BitTorrent or direct download.
[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:47.360]   But which is, I guess, it's IP based, but it's not really on your TV.
[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:49.360]   It's not true IP TV.
[00:53:49.360 --> 00:53:50.360]   Right.
[00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:55.360]   So we agree it's not IPTV until it comes into your living room set.
[00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:57.360]   Yeah, but isn't that changing, though?
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:59.360]   If you start moving forward and looking forward five years,
[00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:03.360]   does the cable, does the box plug into the television become the norm,
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:08.360]   or are people going to be moving towards multimedia computers that are attached to an ACTV?
[00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:10.360]   Or a portable handheld?
[00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:11.360]   There's ACTV sales.
[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:13.360]   I don't think either one of those models is what's going to happen.
[00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:16.360]   I think what you're going to end up with is basically the system we have now,
[00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:21.360]   but with 802.11 and or whatever methodology you want to use,
[00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:24.360]   the ability to go to your computer, push a bunch of buttons,
[00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:27.360]   and have it sent to your TV directly.
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:30.360]   You know, get a feed like what you're doing,
[00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:31.360]   or what, say, Kevin's doing.
[00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:35.360]   I can just click on it, and then I have a compatible box on my television set
[00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:39.360]   that has wireless on it, and I just stream it over there and watch it on television.
[00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:40.360]   Which one?
[00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:41.360]   Which one?
[00:54:41.360 --> 00:54:42.360]   Which one?
[00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:43.360]   Which one?
[00:54:43.360 --> 00:54:44.360]   Which one?
[00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:45.360]   Which one?
[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:46.360]   Which one?
[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:47.360]   Which one?
[00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:48.360]   Which one?
[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:49.360]   Which one?
[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:50.360]   Which one?
[00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:51.360]   Which one?
[00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:52.360]   Which one?
[00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:53.360]   Which one?
[00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:54.360]   Which one?
[00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:55.360]   Which one?
[00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:56.360]   Which one?
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:57.360]   Which one?
[00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:58.360]   Which one?
[00:54:58.360 --> 00:54:59.360]   Which one?
[00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:00.360]   Which one?
[00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:01.360]   Which one?
[00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:02.360]   Which one?
[00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:03.360]   Which one?
[00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:04.360]   Which one?
[00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:07.360]   And personal video recorders, you know, a la TiVo,
[00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:11.360]   that are now being added to cable, to cable set-top boxes.
[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:16.360]   I mean, it allows the hard drive to get the content any time that the cable company can deliver it,
[00:55:16.360 --> 00:55:19.360]   and the user gets to watch it in their TV.
[00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:21.360]   I think it's IPTV if you still need a computer.
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:27.360]   I think it's IPTV if the delivery mechanism is a peer to cable.
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:31.360]   No, I agree with that, except I think with a computer you can add an extra dimension.
[00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:33.360]   In other words, you can get these mini-castes.
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:36.360]   You can get the movies that are maybe more obscure.
[00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:37.360]   You can do a little more digging.
[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:38.360]   True.
[00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:42.360]   What is shooting in the same way that we have VCRs that allow you to add content to your TV?
[00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:43.360]   Right.
[00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:46.360]   I mean, it's interesting we realize that CNN, oh, sorry, Seth.
[00:55:46.360 --> 00:55:47.360]   Roger?
[00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:52.360]   Yeah, oh, I'm just saying it just has to be transparent enough, so someone like my dad can use it,
[00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:55.360]   and it's straightforward enough that you don't need a PC.
[00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:58.360]   But, I mean, you guys are all hitting on a good point.
[00:55:58.360 --> 00:55:59.360]   It's TV-allicart.
[00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:05.360]   You pick the shows you want to watch, not necessarily, oh, I got to pick up MTV because I want to watch,
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:07.360]   you know, Heaven forbid, Pimp, I ride.
[00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:12.360]   I'd say watch what happens with radio and with podcasting because I think that's a precursor
[00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:17.360]   to technology to all of this, and I think that's exactly what's happening right now with radio.
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:22.360]   Is that people are replacing music radio with their iPod because it's got the songs they want
[00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:27.360]   and they don't have any DJs or ads, and they're starting to replace talk radio with podcasts.
[00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:29.360]   And that's exactly the same thing.
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:33.360]   The only difference is one infinity station that they can't make money off of does not entirely
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:34.360]   a trend make.
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:36.360]   I'm not talking about KYOU.
[00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:37.360]   I mean, but...
[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:39.360]   We should make a led infinity bias.
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:42.360]   Anybody wants to buy a stamp right now?
[00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:43.360]   Are they clear, Kelly?
[00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:44.360]   Are they out there listening?
[00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:45.360]   What's their price?
[00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:46.360]   We're up for sale.
[00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:49.360]   Well, it's got to be because we're so early on the curve, it's got to be millions.
[00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:50.360]   Five billion?
[00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:51.360]   Hey, you know what?
[00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:53.360]   We'll trade it for a whole bunch of Google stuff.
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:55.360]   How many people, how many people, how many hosts do we have?
[00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:57.360]   But then they would have to be ads.
[00:56:57.360 --> 00:56:58.360]   You don't want to add?
[00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:00.360]   We got six hosts that's been million bucks.
[00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:01.360]   Hey, do you want to own a house?
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:02.360]   Or do you...
[00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:03.360]   It's six million.
[00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:04.360]   The rest was John.
[00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:05.360]   Yeah, no, no, no.
[00:57:05.360 --> 00:57:06.360]   Yeah, no, no, no, no.
[00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:07.360]   We could crank it up again later.
[00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:08.360]   Okay.
[00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:09.360]   We could always do it again.
[00:57:09.360 --> 00:57:12.360]   Yeah, after the clause, you know, they could go keep you out of the business for a while
[00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:13.360]   with a non-compete.
[00:57:13.360 --> 00:57:18.360]   But, you know, you get a million cash, you know, I can deliver with it.
[00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:19.360]   Somehow.
[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:22.360]   You'll finally be able to get your opals out of that safe, John.
[00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:25.360]   That's a devore act, John.
[00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:29.360]   Did you ever get a safe cracker?
[00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:31.360]   Well, here's the problem, it turns out.
[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:32.360]   We're still working on this.
[00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:36.360]   The problem was that this is defective safe that had a bunch of safety bolts that apparently
[00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:39.360]   if somebody tried to steal the safety things, we'd like throw these bolts all over the place
[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:40.360]   so you couldn't open it.
[00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:41.360]   Right.
[00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:45.360]   Under any circumstance, even with a safe cracker, so it has to be like opened up by the company
[00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:46.360]   in some way, shape or form.
[00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:47.360]   Oh, really?
[00:57:47.360 --> 00:57:48.360]   It has to be drilled.
[00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:51.360]   You can't get like a welder and it just welded it.
[00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:52.360]   Well, essentially, it's what they're going to do.
[00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:53.360]   But there's other ways of doing it.
[00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:55.360]   I think you need a laser.
[00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:57.360]   Hello, two guys.
[00:57:57.360 --> 00:57:59.360]   This is Andy here at Phoenix, Arizona.
[00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:01.360]   I just like saying that.
[00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:02.360]   Hello, two guys.
[00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:03.360]   Okay.
[00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:04.360]   Andy.
[00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:06.360]   Go for the screen, these call.
[00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:07.360]   No.
[00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:08.360]   Okay, here's question.
[00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:10.360]   I wanted to ask you one of the hear what he has to say.
[00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:11.360]   He's so happy.
[00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:12.360]   He is happy.
[00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:13.360]   Good.
[00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:14.360]   I twitched his lucky fill-in.
[00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:15.360]   We're going to look at his fill-in.
[00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:17.360]   Lucky fill-in, sitting in a minute.
[00:58:17.360 --> 00:58:18.360]   Hello, two guys.
[00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:21.360]   This is Andy here at Phoenix, Arizona.
[00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:22.360]   He's cracking himself up.
[00:58:22.360 --> 00:58:23.360]   I was like saying that.
[00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:24.360]   Hello, two guys.
[00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:27.360]   [laughter]
[00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:36.360]   Anyway, John, episode 18 was having some issues there with not being able to send HTML emails
[00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:41.360]   because they were getting assassinated by the fill-in.
[00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:46.360]   John said he had some good tools to use for email filtering.
[00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:54.360]   And I was wondering, since he's not accepting emails, you can do it site if you can post links to tools that he was using to fill-in.
[00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:55.360]   Remember he wouldn't tell us.
[00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:56.360]   Is this three-stage?
[00:58:56.360 --> 00:58:57.360]   No, it was three-stage.
[00:58:57.360 --> 00:58:58.360]   It was three-stage.
[00:58:58.360 --> 00:58:59.360]   It was three-stage.
[00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:00.360]   Time.com.
[00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:01.360]   Computer time.com.
[00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:02.360]   We have a link on it.
[00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:03.360]   The answer is that we did.
[00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:04.360]   Andy, we did post the link.
[00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:05.360]   Yeah, we did.
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:06.360]   Yeah.
[00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:08.360]   But there was that three-stage filtering process.
[00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:09.360]   All right, you know, we did.
[00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:11.360]   John never wanted to tell us about that.
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:12.360]   No, I could tell you about it, but it's boring.
[00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:13.360]   Okay.
[00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:14.360]   It's boring as the other guy.
[00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:15.360]   Lucky fill-in, sitting in.
[00:59:15.360 --> 00:59:18.360]   It's lucky fill-in, sitting in Australia, and I need some help in a major way.
[00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:24.360]   My ISP has started filtering all Peter Peter traffic, and I therefore cannot use BitTorrent.
[00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:28.360]   Changing ISP is an option unless I go back to dial-up.
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:35.360]   I've worked around this by using some open HTTP proxy servers I found online, but these are often hit and miss and pretty slow.
[00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:41.360]   This also means I can only use Bitcomic as other clients not support HTTP proxy servers.
[00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:44.360]   Is there a better way I can avoid this content filtering?
[00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:53.360]   This is going to happen more and more where people block certain kinds of content like BitTorrent to avoid, which is, by the way, a very legitimate way to distribute files.
[00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:55.360]   Our files are distributed that way.
[00:59:55.360 --> 00:59:56.360]   Yeah.
[00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:57.360]   It's a terrible shame.
[00:59:57.360 --> 01:00:02.360]   I think the ISPs are even more paranoid and with good reason in Australia than they are here in the States.
[01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:03.360]   You have a fix for this?
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:04.360]   Yeah.
[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:05.360]   But I think--
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.360]   Well, I should have the--
[01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:07.360]   No, they charge.
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:08.360]   I'm not sure this--
[01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:12.360]   Last time I was there, they still charge by megabyte download.
[01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:13.360]   Oh, you have a--
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.360]   You were--
[01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:15.360]   Yeah.
[01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:16.360]   Metered by how much you download now.
[01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:17.360]   It's hard.
[01:00:17.360 --> 01:00:23.360]   I think that makes a huge difference in the model too because, you know, it's great to say, "Oh, yeah, you've got broadband and you can-- you have all this great connectivity."
[01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:29.360]   But when people really start using it, suddenly it really becomes expensive for the broadband provider.
[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:30.360]   And if people are doing--
[01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:37.360]   You know, it makes it easy to suck down multi-hundred megabyte files, suddenly someone's got to pay that bill.
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:41.360]   How does he get around it?
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:48.360]   I'm curious how they're blocking it because unless they're just blocking the commonly used default ports for the peer-to-peer clients--
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:50.360]   Or he can use a different port.
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:51.360]   Exactly.
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:54.360]   Would he be able to bit torrent with everybody else?
[01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:57.360]   Would he only be able to people who use different-- the different port?
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:58.360]   Would it--
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:00:59.360]   It just means he--
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:02.360]   I wish that-- you know, Cohen might know the answer to this.
[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:03.360]   Yeah, Cohen would know the answer to it.
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:05.360]   Do you have his phone number and we'll call him?
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:06.360]   I don't know if it's somewhere but--
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:09.360]   All right, I'd love to get Bram on the show sometime, like the author of bit torrent.
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:11.360]   We're going to answer the question next week, do some research.
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:15.360]   All right, we'll do some research because, yeah, it does use a standard port but it can use any port.
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:16.360]   Right.
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:21.360]   But then what would that-- the tracker would have to use that non-standard port too, I think.
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:25.360]   I bet you there's a fixed port that Cohen knows about.
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:27.360]   Yeah, this has got to be going on a lot.
[01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:34.360]   I'd be wondering if that's because the Australian P2P sites had basically spent all that money getting their asses beat around the port.
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:37.360]   And I wonder if that's the IIS, Australian ISPs that are just--
[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:39.360]   They want no liability for P2P whatsoever.
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:40.360]   I'm scared.
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:43.360]   Which is the courts have been brutal on P2P in Australia.
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:45.360]   That's really too bad.
[01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:48.360]   Because that means they can't download the system, they can't download.
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:50.360]   I mean, we have an HTTP version.
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:02:00.360]   In fact, I even make a zipped port 80 version of this file for people who not only can't use BitTorrent and they can't use other non-standard ports, but they also can't even download an MP3.
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:05.360]   There are ISPs that will prohibit you from downloading an MP3.
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:06.360]   That's just ridiculous.
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:08.360]   Well, by file extension.
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:09.360]   By file extension.
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:10.360]   So I do it as a zip.
[01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:11.360]   Wow.
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:12.360]   Hi, I'm Kerry.
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:13.360]   And I'm Les.
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:17.360]   We host the signal, the only podcast in the verse dedicated to Firefly and Serenity.
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:23.360]   It was great hearing your hearty recommendation of Firefly in Twit #17 and your Fox bashing technique was excellent.
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:26.360]   However, we believe you were wrong about the theme tune.
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:30.360]   The words of the song relate to the defeat of the independence of the Battle of Serenity Valley.
[01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:31.360]   And they express those things.
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:32.360]   Oh, goodness.
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:33.360]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:34.360]   You're just about already.
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:35.360]   That's what we should mind.
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:38.360]   No, no, no, no, they're talking about the theme that's used in the Firefly.
[01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:40.360]   What they're basically saying is the first thing.
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:44.360]   Yeah, no, actually, Devorik and I are united front on this.
[01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:49.360]   And I personally, I think, you know, I got to say, Joss Whedon, one of my favorite creators
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:50.360]   of television of all time.
[01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:51.360]   I'm tasting music.
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:52.360]   Gift did.
[01:02:52.360 --> 01:02:53.360]   No, yes, great tasting music.
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:57.360]   But the Firefly theme, and I'm a country music, I'm probably the only country music fan.
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:58.360]   I love country music.
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:02:59.360]   Okay, Leo loves country music.
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:03.360]   The Firefly theme, you know, it's just, it's a country theme.
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:05.360]   I don't even know what it's like a pseudo folk theme.
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:08.360]   It's just, it's almost as bad as the enterprise theme was.
[01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:09.360]   Yeah, it's like, Josh, we love you.
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:12.360]   And, you know, these guys are so chipper and perky.
[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:13.360]   They're chipper and perky.
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:14.360]   They're fire.
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:15.360]   They're brown coats.
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:16.360]   They're fireflies.
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:19.660]   They're talking about, Patrick sent me, there's a link at Apple has the trailer for the
[01:03:19.660 --> 01:03:20.660]   Ferenity Trail.
[01:03:20.660 --> 01:03:21.660]   Oh, a Serenity Trail.
[01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:22.660]   They have changed it.
[01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:26.560]   I don't know, Patrick, if you go back to the trailer now, changed it three times.
[01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:29.560]   My son pointed out that if they keep changing it, we'll have the whole movie.
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:31.360]   It'll be called Windows Vista.
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:34.360]   It changed, the latest version is like completely different than the one before.
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:36.360]   We've got a few more hints about the storyline.
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:38.360]   They've got some of the funny stuff.
[01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:40.360]   And you can watch it at 1080p if you've got enough horsepower.
[01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:45.360]   Do they still, I don't think they still have the H264 high def version.
[01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:46.360]   That was great.
[01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:50.360]   But we should, you know, it'd be fun to check out the Serenity podcast that they're talking
[01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:51.360]   about here.
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:54.360]   And the other thing that's going to be interesting is watching how Fox reacts to the movie if
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:58.360]   it's a success or if maybe sci-fi'll start bringing up.
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:00.360]   Josh has said that he, Josh has said that he refused to do it.
[01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:04.360]   Josh has said that he refuses to do a series again, but he might do movies every couple
[01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:05.360]   of years.
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:06.360]   I think the movies are fine.
[01:04:06.360 --> 01:04:10.360]   I'll wait until he screws up one moment before I see you.
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:12.360]   Should we hear the rest of these perky?
[01:04:12.360 --> 01:04:13.360]   Absolutely.
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:15.360]   Because I think they really are sweet.
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:17.360]   Challenge John Dvorak to a duel.
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:22.360]   Or you could just listen to our podcast at www.serenityfirefly.com.
[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:24.360]   They're learning from you, John.
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:25.360]   A duel.
[01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:28.360]   A duel at Don or listen to our podcast.
[01:04:28.360 --> 01:04:33.360]   Do we have to use the swords like they did in the Shin Dig episode?
[01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:35.360]   I'll take that later, John.
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:38.360]   I'll put the batteries in my favorite scenes.
[01:04:38.360 --> 01:04:39.360]   All right.
[01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:44.360]   Let me, as long as we're talking the spokes here, people who cannot download MP3s.
[01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:45.360]   Hello, Twits.
[01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:49.360]   This is Randall calling from near Charles Town, West Virginia.
[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:52.360]   And I have a question concerning MP3 players.
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:57.360]   Where I work, it's a federal job, a three-letter agency.
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:03.360]   And as you might imagine, they don't allow any sort of device that plugs into a USB port.
[01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:10.360]   And it's gotten to the point where they're not going to allow MP3s written onto CDs anymore.
[01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:18.360]   So I'm wondering if there's an MP3 player which can be run using flash memory, like SD cards,
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:22.360]   compact flash, or memory sticks.
[01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:25.360]   I'm sure they probably would allow that, but who knows?
[01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:26.360]   Wait, wait.
[01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:27.360]   Do they make such a thing?
[01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:28.360]   I had the same problem with the test site.
[01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:31.360]   They wouldn't allow in certain devices that were USB storage devices.
[01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:32.360]   With where?
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:34.360]   In Nevada test site when I was working there.
[01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:35.360]   Yeah.
[01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:37.360]   It wouldn't allow me, you couldn't bring them into the building?
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:40.360]   No, you couldn't bring them into the facility at all.
[01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:45.360]   So he's looking for a USB player with no flash memory, no USB connection?
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:47.360]   Can we play this again?
[01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:48.360]   This is confusing.
[01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:52.360]   I think he just wants a flash plated without a USB connector.
[01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:55.360]   Three-three's written onto CDs anymore.
[01:05:55.360 --> 01:06:03.360]   So I'm wondering if there's an MP3 player which can be run using flash memory, like SD cards,
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:06.360]   compact flash, or memory sticks.
[01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:07.360]   There's a bunch of them.
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:08.360]   I'm sure they probably would allow that.
[01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:09.360]   There's plenty of them.
[01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:10.360]   But they don't have a USB port.
[01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:12.360]   Yeah, the problem is with these days, okay.
[01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:19.360]   Basically, they want nothing I can connect to a local computer that can be used to a pocket PC device.
[01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:20.360]   They want to allow those in.
[01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:21.360]   They want voice recorders.
[01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:22.360]   You can actually, you know what?
[01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:26.360]   How about this not having to listen to music all day and doing some work?
[01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:28.360]   Heck, there's money here.
[01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:29.360]   Sorry, money.
[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:33.360]   Actually, what he needs is essentially an older MP3 player that doesn't have an internal,
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:37.360]   or doesn't have an onboard USB, that doesn't have an onboard USB jack.
[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:39.360]   Even my Rio, my diamond Rio, the USB jack.
[01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:41.360]   Yeah, but I think what he's asking me is,
[01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:46.360]   is there a, you know, basically older USB players don't have the USB jack built into it.
[01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:51.360]   So if you spend some time searching around online on eBay or Craigslist.org,
[01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:55.360]   you can probably find an old MP3 player we can sell like any of the old diamond Rio.
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:57.360]   Yeah, it's headed to him.
[01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:59.360]   Put in the box of crap.
[01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:01.360]   Are we still not giving it away yet?
[01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:03.360]   No, this is a sore spot.
[01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:05.360]   The box is ready to go.
[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:06.360]   My wife says she'll send you.
[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:11.360]   My wife says she'll send you.
[01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:13.360]   My wife says she'll send you.
