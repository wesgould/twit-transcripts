[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:58.080]   Tech news. This is the third week in a row. We've had a full in studio panel. I love it when
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.040]   a plan comes together. Harry McCracken is here at the Technologizer Fast Company.
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.040]   Dot com. Always a pleasure to have Harry in studio. Thank you, sir.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.600]   And look who the cat drug in.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.880]   He's talking to me to you.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.120]   I'm like, this is my individual. It's really funny. I love that. It must be Alex.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.920]   It must be Alex. We'll have editor in chief of Crunch Base News at Alex on the Twitter.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.400]   Hello, Alex. Haven't seen you in ages. You look fantastic. You look amazing.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.680]   I haven't been on like six months and my hairline's gone back another half inch.
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.680]   So you make two more years and I'll just be completely.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.680]   But you also look fit as a fiddle. I worked out just for the show last night.
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.280]   That's not a lie. I did that. Yeah.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.800]   You told me you did 100 pushups and some of those stuff last night.
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.680]   Yeah. I was like, I've got a camera for two hours. I'm as old. I try.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.760]   If I did 100 pushups, it would be my last stuff that I ever did.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.680]   Megan Moroni is also here. I'm thrilled to have Megan in, of course,
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.160]   our co-host at iOS today and Tech News Weekly and longtime Twitter.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.720]   I'm sorry. I can't say that.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.280]   A longtime Twit.tv participant.
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.040]   So who's buying a Mac Pro?
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.000]   Wrong question. Who's boss is buying them a Mac Pro?
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.800]   Yeah.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.960]   No, go ahead and go ahead and go out.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.160]   What movie can I get to see for someone who's a Mac Pro to make that movie?
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.120]   I talked today to a long time 40 year film editor.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.200]   Actually 30 years been doing it since his 30s and the 60s.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.640]   He was driving to Vegas. He says, I don't need the new Mac Pro.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.040]   I'm actually making my new documentary on an iPhone.
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.040]   But there are people who need a new Mac Pro.
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.720]   I have to say, thank you, Apple.
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.120]   Maybe a little too literally took us seriously when we said we wanted the cheese
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.120]   greater back. I was amazed on Twitter at the number of people said it actually looks like
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.240]   a cheese greater.
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.320]   Looks even more like a cheese greater than the old cheese.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.440]   The old cheese greater.
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.640]   But Apple did, I would say the biggest takeaway from me from WWDC on Tuesday,
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.000]   the keynote, or Monday I should say, the biggest takeaway from me was Apple has listened
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.520]   and listened in a lot of ways.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:13.280]   But the Mac Pro is the first one. This was the Mac Pro they should have done in 2013 when they did
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.080]   that trash can.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.880]   Which went into the trash can.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:17.440]   Yeah.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.680]   No one liked it. But I think this is going to be super popular.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.360]   Well, not only did no one like it, Apple admitted in 2017 that it was
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.160]   a misdesigned that because of thermal issues, they couldn't actually make it any better.
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.600]   They couldn't upgrade it. They hadn't upgraded it for six years.
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.120]   They said, we're going to have a new Mac Pro. We're working on it now.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.080]   But it's going to be, they didn't say how long, but they said it's not going to be next year.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.960]   They were right. It wasn't. It was 2019.
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.080]   It'll be out in September. It starts at $6,000.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.480]   But that's modestly equipped.
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.160]   Really, like a 256 gig heart drive.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:59.280]   No one knows how much it will cost, but it will be upgradable to 1.5 terabytes of RAM.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:05.520]   One of the tech blogs said, depending on what they put in there, that could be as much as $20,000.
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:14.560]   The 28 core Intel W processor sells for around $10,000.
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.160]   Just for the processor.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.280]   Just for the processor.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.560]   I'm thinking if you put all 28 cores and nobody's going to put it on with two or
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.960]   about half.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.760]   Afterburner graphics option, which gives you not one, not two, not three, but four
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.000]   Radeon graphics cards, Vega Pro cards.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.880]   Then there's a lot of optional stuff. There's this fabric connect interleave thing that I don't.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.480]   There's part of the, I think part of the reason Apple did what they did is because
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.600]   it's, you can't really say, okay, well, how much would a PC cost?
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:52.080]   Because nobody, you can't get any of these. Promise makes the hard drive module.
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:58.720]   Nvidia makes, not Nvidia, Radeon AMD's Radeon makes the GPU module.
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:02.800]   Maybe eventually they'll offer these for PCs, but right now you couldn't build a comparable PC.
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.640]   So there's no way to comp the price.
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:11.120]   They did claim that the base unit compares with PCs that are even more expensive.
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.640]   That's probably true though, right?
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:17.760]   Yeah, I mean, it's not so much as it's an expensive Mac. It's that it's aiming at the super high end
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:18.480]   part of the market.
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:23.360]   That's why the price point isn't a huge point of contention. If you're going to spend 6 to 10K
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.960]   on a computer, you're buying the one you want, you're not going like, wow, this one's 50 bucks
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.960]   cheaper. I must go with a PC. You're buying the machine you demand for your job.
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.080]   Yeah. I think there are people who would like a Mac that expandable.
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.480]   Oh yeah.
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.920]   But not at that level, kind of down several matches.
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.520]   Those people will be disappointed. But it seems like the people who actually
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:46.080]   Apple is trying to target with this, they did a good job of doing that. It's just that it's
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.840]   not all that many people. It's like a 8-pin.
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.200]   And they have a lot of money to throw at stuff because the faster they can render
[00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:55.200]   animation or whatever, the more money they can make.
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.560]   So it's in studios.
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:00.240]   Yeah. And in most cases clients will pay for the hardware anyway. I mean, that's
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:05.920]   in a way, somebody who's going to charge back the hardware to the client wants it to be expensive
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.800]   because they're going to have their 10% and make more money. So I don't think the price is an object
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.600]   at all. And I do think Apple, when Apple did their apology tour, one of the things they said is
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:21.840]   we have gone out and actually hired professional video editors, music creators, people who use Mac
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:26.640]   Pros. We brought them in house to help us design this. And I think that that's pretty clear.
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:32.800]   That's what they got. They got it. If you said to the designers, money prices no object,
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:37.440]   make the best modular Macintosh you could make. This is probably what you'd get something like this.
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:42.720]   It reminds me a little bit of the McLaren Senna, which is the coolest and best car
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.400]   of all time. And it's just built to go around tracks really fast. And if you want that thing,
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.000]   this is the thing you and if you want to do high quality fast video rendering,
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.560]   here's the machine. But here's a problem. I can't afford a McLaren Senna. What I really want is a
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:08:00.720]   Mac mini with all the guts. And so I'm not mad. The Mac mini is much better. In fact, for a lot
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:05.360]   of people, a Mac mini would be a good choice. Thunderbolt means you can have that external GPUs,
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:10.560]   external hard drives. So for many people, the Mac mini or the new iMac Pro, which is $5,000,
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:18.320]   that might be a better choice. I agree with you, Harry. There is a little bit of a missing
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:23.360]   piece in the middle, but not much used to be you could say, well, what's your budget? This is the
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:29.840]   Mac you want. And it was a fairly linear graph of price power. There is a little notch there.
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:36.080]   There are people who like stuff like internal drives. And I mean, if you're into internal
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:46.240]   upgrades and you don't have $6,000 plus another $4,000 for the monitor plus money for the stand,
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:52.560]   then you might be disappointed. Okay, one tactical error Apple made. The stand, right?
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:58.320]   It's fine to announce the stand that showed the stand. It was a mistake to say the price of the
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:05.920]   stand. And probably what they should have said is the monitor is $6,000 and includes a stand.
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:10.560]   I understand why they decoupled the stand. A lot of professionals don't use stands. They use visa
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:16.320]   arms. There's a visa mount. They'd spend money on the visa mount instead. But of course, it was
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:21.680]   a huge mistake and that you could tell the minute they said on the stage. There were groans.
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:27.280]   I think a lot of it was. I mean, there are all kinds of Windows PCs and workstations
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:31.760]   that compete for this market. You just never hear about them unless you're a potential customer.
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.640]   And Apple being Apple, this thing got a huge amount of attention.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:40.720]   They people like us who will never buy this. So stuff that looks ludicrous to us is actually
[00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:45.440]   totally saying if you are one of the relatively small number of people who might actually buy one.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:49.280]   I think that the general reaction of the pro community is this is exactly what we want.
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:53.280]   And the people in the room were developers. I mean, developers do like powerful computers,
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:58.800]   but even developers don't need machine this powerful. You don't need a pro display XDR.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:05.280]   And as Apple pointed out, and they started with this, a really high-end professional
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:10.400]   accurate video display, 25,000, 50,000 dollars would be expensive. So a $6,000
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.840]   monitor is not that big a deal. I have a question about all the stuff.
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.560]   I got a quote to vendor Hardeworn and Gadget who wrote,
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:22.720]   a $999 monitor stand is everything wrong with Apple today. You could pinpoint the exact
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:28.160]   moment when Apple lost the audience on Monday. John Turnis, the company VP of hardware engineering
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:34.080]   revealed the pro display will cost $4,999. It's pricey, but reasonable considering the
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:40.080]   features. But then there was one more thing and not the good kind. One hour, 42 minutes and five
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:45.920]   seconds into the keynote stream, he revealed the stand as a separate $1,000 purchase. The crowd,
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:51.520]   which is mostly enthusiastic until then, actually they had huge applause for dark mode in iOS.
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:56.960]   Yes. Actually, the biggest applause, I think, was the tip calculator in the Apple Watch app.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:02.160]   But the audience erupted into cautious murmurs enough to make Turnis
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:08.080]   stammer as he continued on. He was unprepared for the Apple faithful to question the glorious
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:13.840]   technology being bestowed upon them. It's good writing. But here's my question. So we all agree
[00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:18.640]   that this new computer is fantastic, has a market. The monitor is fantastic, has a market.
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.600]   How big is that market? How many people are out there actually?
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:29.760]   How many people have a McLaren? Ford makes a GT for $450,000. They're going to make
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:35.520]   fewer than a thousand of them, but they make it. I think this is Apple's McLaren or GT.
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:40.160]   It's a Halo car equivalent. It's a Halo car. It's the race car. It's the one you make to show that
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:46.080]   you can make the best thing possible. There will be a market, but it may not be more than a thousand
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:49.680]   people. It might be a very small market. It doesn't matter because I'm pretty dumb and I
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:54.560]   disposable money. They couldn't ties me to overspend on a computer, but looking at the Mac Pro,
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:12:01.120]   they have something for you to overspend on. I overspend on a Mac Pro for $5,000.
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:08.160]   By the way, that was the base price. I probably spent a little bit more because I wanted 10 cores
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:14.080]   because 10 is better than 8. Obviously. That way you can run a 15 Chrome tabs instead of 13.
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:18.320]   You know, it's totally shameful. Yeah. That's why you need one and a half terabytes of RAM.
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:25.040]   What is terribly shameful is I have that Mac Pro on my desktop. Almost always, I will use my MacBook
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:31.520]   Air, which I mean on paper is probably a hundred times slower. I can't tell the difference.
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:38.720]   It's not like I go, "Oh, this is so slow. I have to go use my desktop."
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:44.720]   But are you editing video or? Oh, you don't need it. Rendering the next picture movie.
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:49.840]   I mean, I have a question. So I get that a car is something that you just want to have
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:53.520]   just to show that you have a car, but this is a machine that you could use to make something
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:13:00.160]   and make something great. So does it put more independent creators at a disadvantage because
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.560]   they don't work for Pixar or they just are trying to create something and they don't have that
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:07.840]   power. They can't afford it. That was my exact response to this editor who said,
[00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:11.360]   "I mean the Mac Pro. I can't afford it. I don't need it. I'm going to use my iPhone."
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:15.920]   I said, "This is exactly what I think is most interesting about the age we live in is that you
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:21.680]   can create. There's YouTube, which means you don't distribute a film worldwide with no money.
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:26.240]   There's your iPhone, which means you could shoot 4K video, edit it, and distribute it from your
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:32.640]   phone while you're driving to Las Vegas. We live in a world where all that really matters is your
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:39.120]   ability to technology. So you don't do it. You make Roma,
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:45.040]   right? Or a time solo longer to render maybe? Yeah, or you get a cup of coffee while you're
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:48.560]   rendering that scene. I think the point is good, but I don't think this is going to give people
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:52.320]   that are professionals and have bigger budgets, such a leap ahead of independence. That independence
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:59.040]   become impossible in the market. No, because honestly, the only thing that you need that really is
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:04.960]   requirement is talent and ability, desire. The technologies, there's a huge range in many price
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:09.440]   points. I guarantee you there, look, Steven Soderbergh's last movie was shot on an iPhone.
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:16.320]   I guarantee you that there are great things being done with cheap technology. We know it. All it
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:20.960]   takes, what it really takes is the one thing you can't buy ability. Good story.
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:26.160]   So good story. You can drive a less powerful car, still very quickly on a track, but if you are
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:29.840]   also the best and you're the best car, you can set all time records and that's Pixar
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:33.760]   in this analogy. And I'm the kind of guy who buy a McLaren to drive and stop and go traffic.
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:38.400]   Uh, please tell me you don't have McLaren. Not yet. And now that you said it was something
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:43.440]   well, it's between that and the Mac Pro. I really, uh, I'm way in my office. They both generate the
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:47.280]   same amount of heat I hear. So it's a very close comparison. Yeah, I don't, they didn't mention what
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:55.040]   the TDP would be for this 28 core Xeon processor, but I think it's like four or 500 watts. They did
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:15:00.320]   mention that the power supply would be massive. 1.4 kilowatts or something like that. One and a
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:05.840]   half kilowatts. Um, that means your lights dim in your house when you, when you render,
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:11.760]   you render faster, but you can't see anything. I like this car technology analogy thing. We
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:17.040]   should try this more often. We've tried it. You remember that meme that went around that, uh,
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:23.600]   if, if cars had improved as fast as technology, well, you remember that? They'd all cost 15 cents.
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:28.240]   Yeah. You have to turn them off four times a day and not do it them. Yeah. And they would crash on
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:34.480]   their own question. That's a 1995. I don't know how those works. Exactly. It's an old joke.
[00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:39.360]   So I'm just saying we've been doing this for a long time. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not responsible for
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:44.080]   that crazy metaphor. Uh, although I probably repeated it many, many times. Oh, are you gonna buy
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:47.360]   a Mac Pro? The new one? No, of course not. I don't know any, but I literally though,
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:52.080]   the only person on case. So I asked Alex Lindsey, who if anybody that we know is going to buy a
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:57.120]   Mac Pro be Alex Lindsey, he does professional production. He was on a set somewhere he couldn't
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:01.840]   talk. I said, I'd love to know what you think. I said, how many are you going to buy? He says,
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:07.280]   depends on how much money I can get when I mortgage my house. He said, I'll buy as many as I can,
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:12.160]   but honestly, that's, that's the level of expense we're talking about. It'll probably be.
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:17.120]   It probably costs as much as an inexpensive car. 20, 30,000. Yeah. Didn't we price it out as like
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:22.640]   four years at a state school or four years at a state college? That's sort of the way I look at
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:28.560]   money. You have a choice. You can render faster or go to college, which would you like? Apple listened
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:32.640]   about the iPads to one of the complaints I had. And I think a lot of people had about the iPad
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:38.000]   Pro was that it was a lot of hardware running and operating system meant for a phone, a phone in
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.760]   about 2007. And they've actually now, maybe it's just lip service. Maybe they're really doing
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:49.680]   something, but they've separated out the iPad OS. It is not iOS anymore. It's iPad OS. And they've
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:55.280]   given a lot of desktop features to the iPad Pro. Some have called again the radio show and said,
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:17:02.880]   I just bought a MacBook. Should I have an iPad Pro 12.9 and a MacBook? Do I need the MacBook anymore?
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:08.800]   Yes. You say yes. Alex is nodding, which doesn't work that well on a podcast.
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:13.040]   Oh, I'm so sorry. Harry and I were talking on the way up here. We were driving up. He very
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:17.280]   nicely drove me up. And he's an iPad fan. And I am actually on the other side of this device.
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:22.240]   I'm a laptop. Yeah, you use look at Harry's using the iPad 12.9. I've used iPads as my primary
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:27.360]   devices since 2000. You must be thrilled. It looks just great. I mean, you're right that when they
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:32.320]   announced the new hardware last year, the hardware went way past what the software was capable of
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:37.840]   to such a degree that I assumed that the good stuff must be coming at WWDC because it would be so
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:44.160]   weird to put in a USB C port and then let you do anything with it essentially. So most of the stuff
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:49.120]   that I hoped would happen did happen last week. You were right. I mean, I didn't anticipate.
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:52.880]   Apparently all they had to do was flip a switch on that USB C port and suddenly they can you could
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:56.560]   put a thumb drive in there. You could put a USB hard drive. If it's a desktop class browser,
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:02.480]   like they say it is, that's huge news. Tell me about that. So you're using an iPad as your day-to-day
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:07.680]   computer, right? And the Safari on there is basically the iPhone version of Safari.
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:12.160]   It's pretty much. I mean, there's a lot of stuff that works great, but the more sophisticated a web
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:16.640]   app is, the more likely it is, it won't work well, which in a lot of cases is not a major problem
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:22.000]   because some things have great native apps, but there's a lot of stuff that does not have a great
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.920]   native app like Google G Suite. We run into that all the time because we use G Suite for our shows.
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:33.440]   Google's apps for the iPad range from sort of mediocre to really bad, and I'd be much happier
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:38.800]   using the web-based versions, which up until now have not worked at all. And if those work really
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:45.120]   well in Safari on the iPad, it'll make a huge difference. Only somebody uses the iPad day and day
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:48.720]   out will understand why that makes a big difference. The desktop Safari makes a big difference.
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:55.360]   Yeah, because I spent a lot of money on this very powerful large screen tablet and Google Docs,
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:19:00.480]   Google Docs app version is rudimentary. And if you need to use Google Docs,
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:06.880]   getting access to the full version is huge. Microsoft Office is really good on an iPad.
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:11.040]   Yes, and there are also web-based versions of the office apps.
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:16.560]   How do those work on the? The native Microsoft office apps are really good.
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:18.880]   I don't particularly want to use the web-based ones.
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:20.720]   But they'll be better with Safari.
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:26.320]   AirTable, we use AirTable at Fast Company. The iPad app is not very good. I think I'll be
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.320]   much happier using the web-based version.
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:34.800]   There's also little things like the grid of icons, which has been so wasteful on the iPad for so many
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:39.520]   years. You have this big screen and you still are, there's lots of space in between the icons.
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:40.640]   They're going to fix that.
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.880]   And you can put on widgets on the desktop if you want to.
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:45.440]   This is something that anybody's used Android for any time.
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:49.440]   Understands the value of widgets. It's the main reason I love my Android phone.
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:54.240]   Even like scrolling. Working on small documents on the iPad is fine.
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:59.520]   But if you're working on like a 6,000-word document, it's been very sluggish to go through it.
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:00.960]   Do they say they'll be improvements?
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:03.680]   They have scrolling much more on a desktop where you can
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:07.120]   the faster you scroll, the faster it goes up through it.
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:13.440]   And they didn't talk about it. It's hidden in accessibility, but mouse support.
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:19.200]   Mouse support, yes. It's aimed at an accessibility feature for people who have challenges with touching
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.680]   the screen. And yet so many people said, "Oh, good. They did it."
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:26.560]   I think that there are people who want, do you want a mouse on your iPad?
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:30.080]   Yeah, particularly. And I think people who expect this to be just like using a mouse on a Mac
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:35.920]   might be disappointed. But it also sounds like if Apple implemented this, they've done 80% of
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:40.400]   the heavy lifting they need to do to offer it as just a standard feature to everybody.
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:42.080]   They did. I thought an interesting thing.
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:51.520]   The reason I want a mouse is stupid, but the switching of the mode from typing to touching
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:55.440]   is enough of a movement of the hand that it slows me down.
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:56.720]   I just need a trackpad.
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:00.240]   A trackpad would be nice. And there are a lot of keyboards that have room for not the Apple
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:04.080]   keyboard, but the bridge keyboard for instance, have room for a trackpad, but no trackpad.
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:06.800]   But what they did do, which I thought was really interesting.
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:11.680]   So I interpreted them hiding the mouse as a way of saying, "Well, we don't want to emphasize the
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:15.760]   mouse because we really think it's a touch device and it should be touch and you should use touch
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:21.360]   and you should only use mouse if you can't use touch." But then they talked about the fact that
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:25.600]   there are going to be many, many more keyboard shortcuts in all of the apps.
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:31.600]   And that is to me a great thing because I can keep my hands on the keyboard. That is a strange
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:37.040]   thing though, to put in an iPad. And that's when I lose my attractiveness to it. I mean, to me,
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:42.880]   if you have mouse support, keyboard shortcuts and a screen, I have a laptop. And laptops are amazing.
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:47.760]   They're so good. This laptop that I have is an old MacBook Pro. It is a tank. I've broken the
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:51.520]   keyboard. That's why you like it because it has the old keyboard. It doesn't have that ridiculous
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:55.760]   touch bar. It's from 2015. Yeah, I would not. That was the last good MacBook. I would not
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:59.360]   trade it for a brand new top of the line iPad Pro because I just need no advantage and I see actual
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:04.400]   disadvantages. Meghan, meanwhile using the 13 inch 2017 or 2018 MacBooks. Yeah, it was fun.
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:09.520]   It's got the touch bar. Yeah, I don't ever use it. Yeah. In fact, the only time I ever use it is to
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:14.960]   accidentally hit Siri in the middle of typing. I accidentally hit stuff. But I want to know why
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:19.120]   Harry prefers the iPad life because people that I know in respect do this and they swear by it.
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:23.600]   So what am I missing? You miss an iPad life like thug life. Yeah. How do you like that?
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:26.720]   iPad. You have to ask. You'll never understand. On the mean streets of Petaluma.
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:32.800]   No, but what really sings to you about it? Sure. Well, but basically, because that's a relatively
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:38.800]   new platform, it has a lot less cruft. Your Mac and Windows PCs have decades of stuff that's
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:44.720]   built up. I figured when I use a Mac or Windows PC, a lot of the time I feel like I'm devoting 20%
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:50.160]   of my time to be like being a mechanic from my own computer. My Mac is telling me I have all the
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:54.400]   disk space I need on my Mac. And despite that, it flashes a message every five minutes in the
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:23:00.800]   corner telling me I'm running out of disk space. And I should do this or that. I don't, I feel like
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:07.040]   a lot of ways windowing was a step backwards for computers. If you have like 17 windows on your
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:10.880]   desktop and you don't have to drag them around and some of them are overlapping on others,
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:17.600]   I like the iPads approach to it much better where you can have a couple of apps on screen and in
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:22.960]   iOS 13, they're also adding stuff to make that better. But you don't have windows floating around
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:29.120]   and overlapping when you don't want. There's just a little bit less of all the stuff that's
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:35.680]   built up over the years. It's more modern. It's better at touch. I mean, I'm aware of things like
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:41.760]   the surface, which have touch and it's just fine. But ultimately on a surface, I'm aware I'm using
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:48.240]   apps for the most part that were not designed to be touch first. Every iPad app is touch first.
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:53.360]   It has suffered a little bit with the keyboard in the past because the shortcut some things have
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:59.680]   not been as predictable. But I think the fact that Apple has slowly made this a more powerful
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:05.040]   platform has been helpful because they haven't rushed their way through some of these decisions
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:09.760]   that are hard to get right. Like Windows 8, payments. Oh my god. What a nightmare. Yeah,
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:17.840]   Microsoft saw the iPad as being really dangerous and very quickly tried to turn windows into
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:23.120]   something to compete with that. And in some ways it was cool, but they made lots and lots of mistakes,
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:29.120]   which even now they are undoing. What app do you use to write? I use Scrivener, which is,
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:34.720]   I mean, it's my single most essential app. I would not use a computing platform that didn't
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:39.600]   have Scrivener. It's interesting because Scrivener is just one of maybe a dozen apps that have similar
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:44.880]   features there. The Scrivener allows you to keep research notes side by side with what you're writing.
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:49.360]   Ulysses is another one that some people swear by. I've used that. Do you guys run on WordPress
[00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:55.360]   or different CMS? We're on WordPress and WordPress, about 90% runs fine on an iPad,
[00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:58.160]   but they mentioned WordPress during the keynote. That's another one of those.
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:02.160]   Something that works even better in the new browser. I'm interested in pressing you don't
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:08.720]   write in the CMS. I do all watch. I use Scrivener for my more elaborate projects, where I'm interviewing
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:13.760]   people and doing transcriptions, and pull you up old stories for a lot of shorter stories for the
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:18.720]   web. I write into the CMS. There you go. iPad has gotten better and better for actual work like
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:24.080]   that. For a long time, it really was just a consumption device. People like you are the people taking
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:28.400]   the arrows in the back as you charge over the hill with your iPad. Five or six years ago,
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:32.400]   I spent half my time arguing with people who told me that I could not use my iPad.
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:41.280]   To do stuff, you don't hear that very much anymore. Honestly, I still feel like it's a little of a
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:45.760]   stretch. It's a little square peg round hole. You have to really want to do it. Do you not feel
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:49.040]   that anymore? Do you feel like, "No, this is it. This is my flow. I'm working."
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:54.240]   I feel ultimately people are pretty smart and for the most part, the thing you think is the best
[00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:59.840]   device for you probably is. If you're skeptical about the app, I'm not going to try to convince
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:05.200]   you to use an iPad if you don't want to. That's probably a bad sign. I think over time, more and
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:10.160]   more people at least have the option of using an iPad. If there are a million things you love about
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:15.920]   your Mac or your PC or your Surface Studio, there's no reason to switch what you like.
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:21.040]   Use what you like. It's a personal computer after all. I feel like it's generally a bad
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:24.960]   sign if somebody else thinks they know better than you do what you should be using.
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:30.640]   You don't feel personally as you use your iPad that you're compromising, that you're kind of
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:37.760]   putting up with stuff. I've certainly discovered a little workarounds, some of which I don't think
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:41.360]   I'll have to use anymore with iOS. There's to me a little cognitive load with it. That's,
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:45.280]   I guess, what I'm saying. There's a little burden. I feel like there's also a cognitive load with
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:51.120]   Macs and PCs. There are certain things I like doing better on a Mac. I have a lot of stuff in
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:57.520]   Dropbox. If I'm moving mass quantities of files around in Dropbox, that's still been easier on
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:03.120]   a Mac or Windows PC than on an iPad. You give me hope because if I can...
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:08.560]   I have to say, this is not going to happen to iOS 13. You can do a public beta at what next month,
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:15.280]   Megan. I think what they said next month. In the fall, it'll be out. I think that's the time I might
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:20.240]   sit back and say, "Okay, let me give it another shot seeing if I can work entirely on an iPad."
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:28.000]   There are some much-needed features. I don't think dark mode is one of them, but we are going to get
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:35.280]   dark mode. I also have some concerns about the additional gestures. My biggest problem with iOS
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:43.280]   in general compared to a desktop operating system is the issue of hidden affordances of
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:54.160]   discoverability. To remember that a three-finger swipe is undo and a three-finger pinch is a cut,
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:28:01.840]   and a three-finger open is paste, or is a vice versa. I don't use those finger things.
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:07.600]   Even the guy who was trying to demo it on stage couldn't really do it. He said, "Oops,
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:11.360]   oops, oops, a bunch of times." I'm a little skeptical about those.
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:15.280]   I wish they... But that's what you have to do in a touch interface. You have to overload all the
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:19.360]   gestures. The nice thing about old-fashioned interfaces is with menus, at least you can find
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:23.840]   stuff if you can find it, which is sometimes tough. Yeah, I can't remember all the Emacs commands,
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:28.240]   but I know if I have a menu bar, I can at least remind myself, and eventually they become second
[00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:33.840]   nature. Apple has really trained me, though, to deal a lot more with touch, because I run an Apple
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:38.240]   mouse and an Apple touchpad on my keyboard. So you have the Magic Trackpad? Yeah, yes. So I do
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:43.280]   gestures here and mouse-ing, and typing in the middle. That's my corporate setup. I've really
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:48.800]   gotten accustomed to doing it. Even though you're a right-handed person, I can't mouse-
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:52.880]   ambidextrous? No, I'm dumb. But you're able to trackpad with your left hand? Yeah, because it's just
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:56.720]   little gestures you do to open all your windows at once and bring them back in. And so I wonder if
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:00.480]   they're just training us to be more functional with their hands than we otherwise would be.
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:03.920]   And I wonder if in five years this will feel very normal to us, very intuitive, because if
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:08.480]   Harry's right, if we all end up using iPads, which could happen, we're going to need to have
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:13.040]   that level of, I think, gesture control. I don't think that, by the way, I think a lot of people
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:17.360]   are just... I apologize. She does not think that. I have a question, though. Do you have a Mac book?
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:23.600]   It's like a backup? I have a Mac book, which I keep at home. Like my MacBook Pro is like my desktop.
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:31.840]   It's my power machine. But at work, I have the iPad. And for a while, I also had a Chromebook,
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:36.320]   which I would once in a great while use for stuff I could not figure out how to do on my iPad.
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:41.200]   And it's been a long time since I've had to resort to the Chromebook. I like a command line.
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:47.040]   I just feel like this is... If you took this away from me, I would probably use the iPad. But
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:50.640]   since I have this, I always go back to it. That's a good point. And some people have said that the
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:57.920]   iPad isn't an exclusive device. It fills a niche in between a desktop and a laptop. Or a desktop,
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:04.320]   maybe a laptop and a phone. Yeah. For me, there's just no space there. I feel so happy with this.
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:12.000]   You got the two things. I think you're more... I think more typical response from most people.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.280]   I'm not going to buy another $1000 device to fill this gap that doesn't really exist for me.
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:19.600]   Well, now you've called me average. I want to move to an iPad.
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:23.440]   I mean, you're normal. You're normal, not average.
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:28.080]   You people outnumber people who are iPad only. I mean, there's no doubt about it for now.
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:32.080]   This is not the dominant way of doing things. When the iPad first came out,
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:37.040]   there was this brief window where it felt like maybe the PC was doomed. It became clear pretty
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:40.960]   quickly that was not true. You're all the stories. You probably won't run on the post PC era.
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:44.560]   I watched some of them. Clearly, the iPad has had a huge amount of influence on the PC.
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:49.760]   Everybody was running scared PC sales tumbled. That's why Microsoft did Windows 8.
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:52.560]   We thought we were in a post PC era, but that didn't turn out to be.
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:54.960]   The relatively familiar PC stalls lags.
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:31:00.240]   Steve Jobs at the time said there are still going to be needs for trucks. You don't get rid of
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:09.360]   trucks. And so the desktop, which for programmers and people doing heavy duty rocket ship design,
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:12.400]   maybe still need some heavy duty hardware on the desktop.
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:18.400]   What's really interesting is how many people who don't need that can move to the iPad.
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:22.080]   And in fact, that's my biggest question and I'd like to open it to all of you,
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:27.440]   is what does this tell us about Apple's future plans? We know a few things, for instance.
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:32.800]   We know that they want to move away from Intel. At least, well, and maybe that's another question.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:38.480]   Maybe they keep using Intel on the Mac Pro side of the equation for really heavy duty.
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:42.160]   The trucks are still running Intel, but they want to move to their, I think they want to make all
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:46.000]   their own chips. And I think they think that the arm chips they design are good enough to replace
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:53.360]   all desktop chips. But maybe they're going to keep some Intel. We also know that the iPhone
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:58.880]   is their number one product. A lot of their focus on the iPhone, a lot of their revenue from the
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:04.000]   iPhone and yet services are becoming important. So that means they'd like to have people in an
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.800]   ecosystem never to leave. They don't want you to say, well, I'm going to have an iPhone,
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:12.080]   but I want a Windows computer. They don't want that. They need to be all Apple.
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:17.280]   And then I've thought for a while, maybe they were getting rid of desktop operating systems
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:24.720]   that Mac OS would gradually become iOS. I think that the announcements they made this
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:29.120]   week change a little bit. What do you think, Alex? Well, they introduced iPadOS, the
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:34.560]   USB-OS, there's WatchOS, there's iOS. They're making more iOS is not fewer.
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:38.400]   I mean, but again, Windows 8 was a problem of fusion. And so they're trying to hear to go
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:41.280]   for more of a dance. Oh, the right tool for the right job.
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:44.800]   Right. Now, the question is, can they maintain that many different platforms at a high level?
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:48.240]   Well, they're, where they almost all of them are still iOS. Well, right. They're iOS with a
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:52.480]   different wrapper on them, but, but Harry's point about things and being improved on the iPad with
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:58.480]   iOS 13, or whatever iPadOS thing that's coming up is probably says they can. Watching Apple's
[00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:02.240]   keynote, I watched a highlight reel before we came on, just remind myself what happened.
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:05.440]   I was shocked at the breadth of what they're doing over there. No kidding.
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:09.360]   It's amazing. That was, that was astounding. Megan and I did the stream,
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:13.840]   you get on our Switch specials on Monday. And that was exactly what we came away with was wow,
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:18.240]   they've been busy. And so if they can keep up that pace of production, probably there's no need
[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:21.680]   for unified OS and they're going to keep things distinct. Maybe they'll move the processor,
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:25.040]   you know, barrier from arm a little bit further, maybe even the MacBooks.
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:30.080]   You don't need to. I think it seems like it's going fine. Everyone seems so happy. I mean,
[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:34.560]   no one left this keynote mad about anything but an overpriced stand they weren't going to buy
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:38.800]   anyways. It was great for memes. I saw a lot of good cheese grater jokes on Twitter,
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:43.280]   but fundamentally the updates were good and the iOS is look strong. The iOS is look strong.
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:47.840]   What do you think, Megan? Because we do a show, iOS today, we talk a lot about iOS.
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:54.080]   And I, you know, my opinion that Apple seems to be, what at least was, did seem to be ignoring
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:59.760]   Mac OS. Well, I think everybody thinks they want a unified OS, but then I mean anyone who tried that
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:04.320]   on Windows really, you know, especially with Windows Phone, like that was never, it never
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:08.880]   worked. People didn't like it. Windows Phone was amazing. Actually, I agree with you, Alex.
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:12.320]   Windows Phone, it wasn't that it wasn't good. We were the only two people who liked them,
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:18.960]   but everyone's a game of two, Megan, sorry. But we do, we need a different OS for a different job.
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:23.920]   And I think people use things differently. But like, for example, I've been using the iPad more
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:27.760]   and more as just an entertainment device. And like, I have a lot of apps on my phone that I
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:31.680]   have an addictive personality. And Apple doesn't mind that because that services, that's income.
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:35.360]   Yeah. And so like, I don't keep Twitter on my phone anymore. I don't keep Instagram on my phone
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:39.600]   or Facebook on my phone anymore, but they're all on my iPad. Yeah. So it's like, when I'm,
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:43.840]   when I've made that decision, like, now I'm going to just. It's a leisure device. Yeah,
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:47.840]   totally. And I'm sure there are other people like me. I don't think that I'm like everyone else.
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:51.280]   Just like, you know, I don't think Harry, but I think that's a common, that makes us,
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:56.080]   that's a sensible usage. Yeah. And if you especially think of people getting older and, you know,
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:35:01.440]   I mean, my dad has bought Max's entire life. He's retired now. Is he going to buy another Mac?
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:05.600]   No, but he's going to, he's bought an iPad every year. It also explains because Alex is not getting
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:10.880]   older and he has no leisure. So you don't need an iPad. I turned 30 really soon. So that joke
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:16.240]   doesn't quite hurt. Oh, that's so old. Okay. I didn't use to be sold. Now I am. So you're actually
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:20.560]   a millennial. Oh, I'm like right in the middle of it. Oh my God. I had no idea.
[00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:22.960]   Do you have an iPad? You look so much older.
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:26.960]   I come on to it really just to get burned by.
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:33.600]   It's amazing. You look great. I thought he was 50. I thought you look amazing for that.
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:35.360]   No, no, I knew I was on a lots more.
[00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:41.520]   For 40, you look amazing. Okay. Back to the question. The answer is I have a iPad original
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:46.320]   and I told God that's not an iPad. I haven't I have. That's from 2010.
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:50.800]   You're like a gamer. So it's the iPad is. Well, I have gaming PC is much more houses and I have a
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:55.200]   MacBook Pro in between and I have a couple of PS. If you had a modern iPad, you could play Fortnite
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:36:00.080]   on it. But I'm not 14. So why would I do that? I can play that's legends like a man.
[00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:05.840]   And if you get that joke, five points, is they fix legends more manly? No, it's good.
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:12.080]   Also for kids. I get there was ironic. I was shooting for irony. I get it.
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:16.800]   What about you, Harry? What do you think apples going? What is what is apples future?
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:23.440]   I mean, at WWDC, it felt pretty good. It felt like most of the engines were firing. It is a
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:29.360]   little intimidating that they have so many platforms. They're updating on this yearly cadence and
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:34.400]   they're all coming out at the same time. And remember in the old days, iOS and Mac OS were
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:38.960]   not coming out at the same time. And the occasion to lay them and they were not yearly.
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:44.080]   It's a little intimidating as happy as I am to think of the update. iPad OS every year,
[00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:47.840]   that's on top of everything else. It's just a challenge to do that.
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:53.280]   That was the excuse we gave Apple was that they just can't do everything. So they have to change.
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:58.960]   In fact, I even thought of it as the the baleful eye of Mordor that they would they would change
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:02.960]   their focus. And now we're going to do this now. There was one year when I think they delayed
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:06.560]   Mac OS by a few months because they needed engineers for iOS. They even said that.
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:12.960]   Now if they did that now, it would be a big deal because we assume that a WWDC,
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:18.080]   they'll be new versions of everything. And there are and they and I think the overwhelming
[00:37:18.080 --> 00:37:23.360]   impression was they had a million things to show and there was many more they couldn't even get to.
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:28.240]   As you said, firing on all cylinders. What happened? Did they suddenly find a bunch of engineers?
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:33.280]   Well, they feel like a big change. They do have a lot more engineers and they did back in the
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:38.800]   years when they had trouble walking and chewing gum at the same time. I remember the the remote app
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:44.240]   was written by one guy. He had gotten reassigned. They didn't update it for years because no one
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:48.640]   else could apparently write a remote app. Then the guy goes back and fixes it. It was there.
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:53.600]   It felt like there was this engineering shortage. And even then Apple was very profitable, had a
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:58.320]   lot of money and it was just assumed. Well, the problem isn't that Apple can't afford to hire
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:01.760]   engineers. It's just there aren't that many great engineers in the world. But apparently there are.
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:06.160]   And it is true that nothing much happened with Apple TV at this event. They'd had this other
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:12.240]   Apple TV event recently. I think people who love Apple TV always feel a little bit like it doesn't
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:16.720]   get enough love from Apple. And they were able to do the new stuff in about five minutes during
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:21.760]   the keynote. They spent more time on dark mode than they did on Apple TV. Who here loves Apple TV?
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:28.320]   I want to dispute that, Dave. I have two and it's I have two mediocre ish. Okay. I love it.
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:34.240]   I also love it. All right. I found the two people. No, I love it anymore than I would love Roku
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:39.200]   if I was using that. It's more polished than Roku. Roku is more capable.
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:47.280]   Like a third the price. It's a lot less expensive. But I tell you like if I in fact have one TV that
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:51.920]   can only has one device, it can't have cable because there's no and it's the Apple TV because
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:58.320]   the quality is good. It's the best. It gives you 4k and HDR even if you didn't buy 4k and HDR.
[00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:03.200]   As far as the store goes, it's got all the same stuff any other store has. And because of
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:07.680]   Disney anywhere, which is called movies anywhere now, I guess, I don't care where I buy stuff because
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:14.160]   it most of it just propagates to all the other stuff. I don't like the TV app, but I don't make
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:18.320]   that my default. I think that's a bad Apple has yet to get that working properly with its
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:22.720]   recommendations. Do you do well with the little remote with the touch bit at the top? They fixed
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:27.120]   the remote used to be the worst remote ever invented. Now it's only the second worst remote
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:31.840]   ever invented because they put a little ring around the menu. So the orientation now is always
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:35.840]   clear. Maybe you can buy new Apple TVs when I'm here. I think you might want the first generation
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:39.520]   or the second generation. I don't know. It's black and it's under my television. Yeah, I have that one.
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:46.160]   I don't know. Probably. You need the latest one, which is 4k HDR and has the new remote. And you
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:50.960]   can buy the new remote standalone if you want. Because the remote is terrible. You can also use
[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:55.360]   the remote app on your phone, which is not terrible. Word? Yeah. But that's a terrible experience,
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:59.360]   which means you're watching TV. You got it. Where's my phone? I just realized the show is just tech
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:08.080]   support for me. Yeah. I feel I actually I was starting to really think Apple was on the road to
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:13.680]   damnation to perdition that the thing I loved most about Apple, which was Mac OS, was getting
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:20.160]   ignored. They hadn't updated the Mac process 2013. And there was one more thing. And we're going to
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:27.920]   pause. There was one more thing Apple did at WWDC, which was listening to everybody I know. And they
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:33.920]   had been ignoring for years. They did something else. We're going to take a break. This is I've
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:38.160]   recently learned about dark patterns. And I'm going to start introducing many dark patterns
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:44.960]   into our programming. So if you would like to know what I'm talking about, you have to listen
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:48.080]   to this commercial. That's a dark pattern, right? I'm here for it.
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:57.200]   I showed Alex Wilhelm is here. Crunch based news. It's so great to see you spend half your time
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:02.800]   in the East Coast. Yes. Apparently you met somebody. Yes. And are you married yet? I get married in
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:06.880]   less than two weeks. I was going to not bring that up because I thought you were going to do that.
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:13.200]   This is his bachelor party. This is you guys. Yeah. Well, Alex, we've got a little surprise for you.
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:20.640]   No. You've heard of the thunder down under? No. I'm sorry. I said the word bachelor party.
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:25.680]   Can we just sort of wind? We're going down a hill here. I don't know. It's the bottom of two
[00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:29.680]   weeks. Less than two weeks. Two Saturdays from now is the wedding here or there? There.
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:34.480]   Yeah. So you just came out for a bit for us. And then you're going right back to Providence and
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:39.920]   they'll fly out Friday night. And you're married Dr. Liz. Dr. Liza. Liza. Dr. Liz is her mom.
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:46.640]   Same job. Same. As somebody who's been married at more than once, you also married the mom.
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:49.920]   I'm just saying the good news is you get the whole family. I get along really well with the whole
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:53.760]   family. They're all really nice. No, they're great. And I'm so happy for you and Liza. That's so
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:58.320]   fantastic. I it'll be the first and last time I wear a suit. I'm really excited about it. I bought
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:02.160]   one for this thing. But shorts, right? Suit and shorts. No, I'm teaching you the shorts right
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:06.560]   afterwards. That's your going away outfit. By the way, I still remember when I was
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:10.400]   gay married 19 years ago. And I remember what you said to me. You said, where are you going to
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:16.800]   marry? And I said outside. And you said, my first wedding was outside. It lasted seven years.
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:20.960]   You've had last in 19 years. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. It's impressive. Isn't that good? Good job.
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:25.760]   19 years in November. Okay. Yeah. So it's not over yet. Yeah. Chickens counting.
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:32.800]   That's Megan Maroney, Tech News Weekly. And of course, iOS today, which will be on Tuesday.
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:38.160]   And we're going to do another developer. Yes. Rosemary Orchard. She does automations. She does
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:42.320]   podcast with David Spire. This will be fun. Yeah. That'll be a lot of fun Tuesday at 9am.
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:45.920]   And Harry McCracken, I still call him the technologist. You'll always be the technologist
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:51.200]   who to me. He's technology editor for Fast Company. And what are you up to these days? You got to
[00:42:51.200 --> 00:42:57.600]   podcast anything you want to plug? Getting married. I'm working on several stories I can't tell you
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:01.600]   about yet. But they'll be exciting. You're long-form stuff at Fast Company. Yeah. So good.
[00:43:01.600 --> 00:43:07.280]   We have the luxury of working on things that take time sometimes. I bookmark every one of them.
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:11.120]   In fact, well, we'll talk when we come back from the end, but I'll talk a little bit about
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:16.960]   your most recently. Our show today brought to you by Atlassian. We're in Atlassian House,
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:22.880]   proud to be our IT department uses Atlassian to get things done to collaborate, to communicate.
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:28.320]   It is really important. I think a lot of people think of Atlassian as for developers,
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:33.600]   but it's also for IT teams. And it's really important as, you know, not just our business,
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:38.400]   but almost all businesses now are IT focused. Whether you're in the cloud, you have technology
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:42.800]   that you have to support, even if you just have a bunch of computers running spreadsheets,
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:50.800]   your IT team is what keeps the lights on, keeps the road rolling, and you've got to plan and
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:56.960]   execute faster than ever. You have to communicate. Incidents often require open, agile, and smart
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:44:03.600]   coordination. You need Atlassian. Atlassian, well known for JIRA, of course, which is the
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:10.480]   tool that most agile teams use. We use JIRA, not as a development team, but as an IT team to
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:16.640]   keep track of projects who's doing what stage it's at. It's a very useful tool. We also use
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:21.440]   Atlassian's Confluence to document what we do. I think that's the thing I would underscore.
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:26.560]   It's great to coordinate your efforts to make sure everybody's doing the right thing and is on
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:31.200]   the right page. It's also equally important to document it. It's equally important to communicate
[00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:35.520]   it. Atlassian makes that easy without leaving the Atlassian platform. If you've got a code base,
[00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:40.320]   you've got Bitbucket. If you have pages to monitor or services to monitor, you need
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:45.600]   Ops Genie status page that helps your team detect incidents better, coordinate response,
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:51.440]   efforts, resolve issues faster, and again, keep customers or stakeholders up to date.
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:57.120]   Here's the thing you really need to know. Bottom line, your team can choose tools that are right
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:45:02.720]   for your current framework and knowing that as you grow Atlassian's tools can grow with you.
[00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:07.840]   They've got so many tools to help you in every area of IT and collaboration.
[00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:11.440]   And of course, because you're in Confluence of the backbone, you never have to leave
[00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:18.000]   the platform to get the job done. Like all of Atlassian's products, the tools you need for
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:23.760]   your IT team are easy and free to try. You go to Atlassian.com/IT to find out which Atlassian
[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:31.760]   offering is right for your team at Atlassian.com/IT. We thank Atlassian for supporting this week
[00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:37.040]   and tech and we thank you for supporting us by using that special address at Atlassian.com/IT.
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:45.200]   So the thing that... What are you laughing at? No, I just live in transitions. They're so smooth.
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:48.400]   You're really good at this. It's fun to watch. Yeah, it's like you've been doing it for a while.
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:54.320]   I am a learner. I'm still learning. Some day I hope to have a podcast of my own.
[00:45:55.840 --> 00:46:02.960]   The thing that I was so grateful for to Apple and we heard it in the rumor. I have been saying for
[00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:07.840]   years and the excuse I guess was, well, they just don't have enough engineering talent.
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:15.520]   What the hell, Apple? iTunes sucks. Nobody thinks iTunes is great, right? Finally, Apple
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:20.560]   puts the nail in the coffin and puts iTunes to bed or do they. I don't know. Did you go to the
[00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:24.240]   event, Harry? I was there. Did you get to see what this new thing, because they're gonna have three
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:27.440]   apps. They're gonna have music. They're gonna have podcasts. They're gonna have...
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:30.880]   What's the third one I forgot? TV. TV.
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:35.280]   Tell me they're not just renaming iTunes music.
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:42.240]   Did you get to play with it? I have not played with it. I was flirting with installing the betas.
[00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:46.320]   I decided to wait until the... That's my deep fear is that they just renamed it.
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:52.400]   They've broken it up. They broke it up and they moved the sync stuff into the operating system.
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:56.400]   It's not on the menu bar, because people wondered, "Well, if I don't have iTunes, how do I back up
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:47:01.840]   my iPhone? How do I restore my iPhone? How do I sync?" All of that's now OS-based, which is
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:06.160]   actually a better place for it. That was the problem. They tried to jam too much stuff into one program.
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:10.880]   It is kind of weird that... When was the last time anybody loved iTunes?
[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:15.200]   It's taken them a decade, finally. It was years ago. I went back and I looked at the
[00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:20.160]   initial response to iTunes, which was "Raptures." Oh, what was? That's because it was so simple.
[00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:24.960]   Do you recall when Steve Jobs told? I think it was Walt Mossberg on stage when Walt pointed out
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:29.600]   that Apple had become one of the biggest Windows developers, because iTunes was so big on PCs,
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:35.440]   and Jobs called it a cool drink of water and hell. And then the joke flipped, because iTunes
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:39.360]   became the thing you wanted to kill more than anything else, no matter what platform you were using.
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:43.600]   Oh crap, iTunes opened. You were never happy to see it. It was like the bad friend who steals your
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:47.200]   stuff. I've always been a little surprised at so many people use that, because I almost never
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:52.640]   touch it. It's been a long time. Every time I plug in my iPhone, I stick pops up. You can turn that
[00:47:52.640 --> 00:47:57.520]   off, which I think I've done. Yeah, now you can sync file, Wi-Fi. You don't really have to.
[00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:03.760]   There are all these other tools, which are great, for everything iTunes does. I use iExplorer,
[00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:08.880]   which basically lets me look at the file system on my iPhone or my iPad.
[00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:12.240]   I've started using Vox to play music, so I don't have to use it for music.
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:19.200]   Yeah, I'm not an Apple music person, even. Yeah. All right. Well, anyway, thank you, Apple, for listening.
[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:26.400]   For the late, but finally listening. They're getting rid of iTunes. The other thing I thought
[00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:32.400]   was really important, and it's going to be more and more important, is Apple is really now a privacy
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:39.840]   company. They didn't hesitate with FindMy.com. They talked about how Apple's... I didn't know this.
[00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:43.040]   Apparently, all Apple laptops have been sending beacons all this time. We didn't even know,
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:47.040]   but they're going to be able to send them, and you're going to be able to find your laptop,
[00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:52.480]   even if it's off without disclosing personal location information, even to Apple.
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:58.160]   Things like that. Apple's putting some... They're putting their mind behind the promise of privacy,
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:01.360]   and I think that's a really smart move. Sign in with Apple?
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:03.600]   The sign in with Apple? I think they're transformative.
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:08.240]   Yes. I'm already seeing it on apps. Day one, we had the day one developer on. They've already
[00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:10.720]   put that sign in with Apple into their day one app.
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:13.040]   And it works on Android, too. It works everywhere.
[00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:13.680]   Yeah, because I just...
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:16.880]   Just as signing with Google, Twitter, and Facebook works everywhere.
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:21.040]   But this time, instead of giving them information, you're giving it to Apple, in fact,
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:25.040]   you don't even have to give your email address to the person you're signing in with Apple obfuscated.
[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:28.880]   Of course, you have to trust Apple, because they will see... If you do that, all the emails
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:33.360]   from that sign... The thing you signed up for will be going through Apple's servers unencrypted,
[00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:39.120]   but I think people do trust Apple. More than in Facebook or Google or Twitter,
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:42.080]   or they've been... Well, I don't have a Twitter in the same platform,
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:43.600]   company... But they have single sign-ons.
[00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:47.600]   All of them have single sign-ons. I don't use single sign-ons. I mentioned this in
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:52.400]   iOS today, because I used to use the Facebook single sign-on. And then, after I clobbered my
[00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:58.240]   Facebook account, I realized I have no way of getting into any of these. So I've realized single
[00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:02.240]   sign-ons are actually very dangerous. You really should always sign in with email so that you have
[00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:05.680]   access to your account. I've been trying to avoid them over the last year or two.
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:10.320]   But it's interesting, because the app developers will have to use it.
[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:14.640]   It says in the guidelines, if you use any of them,
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:19.760]   Twitter, Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, you have to also offer Apple got a sign-on.
[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:24.400]   And it has to be at the top, which I thought was interesting.
[00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:28.960]   And when we talked about it on iOS today, I said, "I don't want to see privacy become more of a
[00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:34.960]   luxury." If this isn't offered to people that don't want to buy a $1,000 phone,
[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:39.520]   but it is going to be on Android. So that's good. But it is interesting, because Facebook has had
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:43.200]   a private sign-on thing, or they announced a private sign-on thing, and they never did it,
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:46.480]   because developers didn't want it. And developers want that information.
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:47.840]   Yeah, they want that.
[00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:51.520]   So that's why Apple has to strong arm them into using the Apple sign-ons.
[00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:55.360]   Snap had a single sign-on that they, the same thing. It's going to be private.
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:51:00.000]   No one else is going to, and nobody uses it. But now everyone's going to use it because it's Apple,
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:05.280]   and it's like you trust, you got to trust somebody. Trust the least offensive of all of them.
[00:51:05.280 --> 00:51:10.000]   Honestly, I know we don't, and this is under a precise line at Google. I hope we don't want
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:17.520]   privacy become a luxury item. It is, and it will be. Period. It's going to be, there's nothing you
[00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:24.240]   can do about it, because if you don't have the cash, you can use free services by trading your
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:30.080]   attention and your information to those free services, it will take cash. You will have to give
[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:35.040]   money to companies like Apple in order for them not to use surveillance capitalism on you.
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:38.960]   That's just how it's going to be. Unless it comes through regulation, unless we have like a privacy
[00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:40.080]   bill that- No.
[00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:45.440]   Are you going to tell Google, you got to give away Gmail, and you can't monetize it in any way.
[00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:48.720]   You're not going to do that. No, no Congress is ever going to do that.
[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:52.960]   I don't think luxury is the right word. I would say for a cost. There will be a price attached to it.
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:56.240]   Luxury implies the McLaren Senna, Mac Pro thing we're talking about.
[00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:57.040]   Or iPhone.
[00:51:57.040 --> 00:52:00.960]   Or iPhone, but I think this will be available at a lower price point than I think you're
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:02.000]   indicating or hinting at.
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:06.400]   But real privacy ultimately will be, and I'll tell you why. I'm reading Neil Stevenson's new book.
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:08.800]   You thought I'd get that, and then you were right.
[00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:08.800]   I did.
[00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:10.160]   It came out this week.
[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:14.400]   Fall or Dodge and Hell. Really good. But he talks about a near future
[00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:20.000]   where, oh, interesting. Face recognition is everywhere. You can't go outside without
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:24.960]   many cameras recording your presence, who you are, what you're doing at all times.
[00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:32.640]   I think we're already there in many municipalities, where people create anonymous personas. He calls
[00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:39.120]   them per does. It's an acronym, P-U-R-D-A-H. And so everybody, we all have real identities,
[00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:44.880]   but people will be able to create multiple personas that will be encrypted, blockchain
[00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:48.080]   encrypted that they will then put out on the internet because it's so dangerous.
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:53.360]   And we already know this. Anybody in the public eye knows dangerous to put out your real last name
[00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:58.400]   or your real address that's being doxed. That's hazardous in the Twitter age.
[00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:02.480]   So they have these identities, and then they wear something called a veil.
[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:07.440]   And they point out that you could wear a veil if you want to avoid face recognition.
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:11.200]   But what these people are wearing, everybody's wearing some sort of augmented reality glasses,
[00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:14.160]   which I think we all agree will be in the next 10, 20, 30 years.
[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:19.120]   So they're, but they have specials. They look like sunglasses, so you can't see their eyes.
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:22.560]   And they have little laser lights underneath them that are beaming
[00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:28.560]   algorithmically lights on your face to prevent face recognition from working.
[00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:34.560]   But you can also program them to be in effect a barcode that's tied to your whatever perda you
[00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:40.880]   want to project as you walk around. This is he's, he's in this novel, he's dealing with
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:46.080]   what he sees as the inevitable consequences of the life we're in right now.
[00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:48.800]   And I think he's right with face recognition and all of this.
[00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:52.480]   I think he's absolutely right. Social media, he says the internet collapses in 30 years.
[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:55.360]   It'll collapse because there'll be so much false information on it.
[00:53:55.360 --> 00:54:00.560]   Only people who can afford an editor, a personal editor, a personal editor to go through it will
[00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:05.840]   have real information. Those who can't will be inundated with so much false information
[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:11.120]   that you'll pick this, the affinity that you have. And you'll believe you'll be, and we're already
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:14.560]   seeing this, by the way, you'll be in that belief group. And that'll be your group.
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:17.760]   And nobody could tell you different like the Tucker Carlson Fox News media.
[00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:22.240]   Yeah, Sean Hannity's affinity group. And we're already there. I mean,
[00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:25.200]   honestly, we're getting there. And you can see this isn't so far in the future.
[00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:28.320]   But the reason I bring all of this up, besides saying it's worth reading,
[00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:31.600]   not so much because it's the greatest novel I've ever written, although I think Stevenson is one
[00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:36.000]   of my favorite novels, but because the ideas in it, I think are really challenging and interesting.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:40.960]   But what he's essentially saying is those who can afford it can get real information on the internet.
[00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:46.240]   And hide their identity. Well, at least not high, but control their identity, control their privacy.
[00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:51.520]   But it is not going to be inexpensive. And he said, most people don't care. They just go out
[00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:55.680]   in the street because they don't care. Yeah, most people aren't on shows like this. They don't
[00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:59.600]   need to have higher levels of protection attached to them. But I think the time will come with it.
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:04.240]   Every, this is the real problem. Anybody can be a target on Twitter. Yeah, like if, you know,
[00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:10.800]   in a custody case or something, like, you know, anything. I think the login with Apple hits
[00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:14.080]   two things. One, the privacy zeitgeist that we've been talking about a lot, I think,
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:17.840]   probably on this show and around the internet for the last couple of years, but also the antitrust
[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:21.840]   wave that we're talking about. Apple is demanding this sort of placement. And I'm curious if that's
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:26.960]   kind of poorly timed given the changing climate in DC about tech giants and their platform power.
[00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:32.480]   There's new controversy lately over the app store and Apple having a monopoly on app distribution.
[00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:35.920]   And I almost wondered whether they might respond to that a little bit at WWDC.
[00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:43.680]   One thing they did not do is let you choose different default apps for iOS. It's still tied to Safari
[00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:49.600]   in their mail app. I think Apple, what they did was doubled down on the monopoly, but they published
[00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:55.920]   a an explanation of why our monopoly is good. They listed a lot of the good third party apps
[00:55:55.920 --> 00:56:02.640]   out there. And it's certainly true for any app Apple has on the offers to people. They're strong
[00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:09.120]   alternative us through the app star. Yeah, they made a case. They didn't say, oh, no,
[00:56:09.120 --> 00:56:12.080]   we don't want to be anopoly or we're going to do something about being a monopoly.
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:15.280]   They said, no, no, we are a monopoly. Essentially, wait, I don't think they said those words,
[00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:19.280]   but that's certainly the takeaway. And it's good. You should be glad. And I think they're
[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:22.880]   doing the same thing with privacy. They're going to say, and I think that this might,
[00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:27.840]   I think they're thinking is this might inoculate them against Congress, against governmental regulation.
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:33.200]   Go ahead, regulate Facebook, break up Google. We don't care because we're the privacy
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:41.440]   company. Now admittedly, this is, by the way, this is a whole nother thread in this issue of
[00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:48.080]   deregulation versus deregulation. So Shoshana Zuboff in our book surveillance capitalism says,
[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:54.800]   you'll never see at least our government or most governments regulating tech too much because
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:57:01.520]   they want the information that tech is getting. That's how governments are surveilling us.
[00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:08.480]   So there's an unholy alliance between law enforcement, Congress, and these big tech companies,
[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:13.760]   as long as you give us information, we're not going to shut you down. That's prison in the US.
[00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:19.120]   And it's wechat in China. Wechat is looped through. China is a good example of what the
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:23.760]   futures could look like here. Especially if you're in the Uyghur portion of the country where some
[00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:29.120]   million Uyghurs or million Muslims are they can recognize them and face recognition. And then
[00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:32.560]   they isolate them and put them in concentration camps. I mean, it's literally evil,
[00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:36.880]   acted out through the power of technology. Shameful. It's awful. But I mean, it's powered by the
[00:57:36.880 --> 00:57:41.280]   stuff that is often innocuous when not used to malicious intent. Facial recognition by itself
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:47.680]   is not inherently evil. It just is always used in evil ways. It seems. I'm just, I'm just
[00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:52.480]   I'm just, and it is somewhat evil because the models used to train these things. This is going
[00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:55.920]   to be a big problem in machine learning in general. The models, many of these companies
[00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:59.600]   like Amazon and Facebook and others are using are based on white people. So they do a terrible
[00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:04.640]   job, a lot of false positives that people of color. There's a lot of, you know, ethical issues
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:09.520]   with it. It also makes them pretty good jokes. There was a woman over on BuzzFeed, Katie
[00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:14.640]   Noppelos, I think, and she did it. She Amazon wanted to scan people's bodies and their underwear
[00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:20.240]   to get like scans of. For measurements, I do it so that they can. So she went in and she
[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:24.000]   refused to sign the non disclosure agreement because she went and write a story about this
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:27.600]   for BuzzFeed. And she just kind of wrote a hilarious story about how Amazon wouldn't
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:33.040]   get her almost nudes. And so she made a lot of Jeff Bezos jokes. It was fantastic. So yes,
[00:58:33.040 --> 00:58:35.840]   we are all going to die and there's no privacy in the world. It's terrible. But at the very
[00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:40.880]   same time, at least we can get along the way to hell. I think you just did a, a little bit of a
[00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:45.040]   faux pas. I just want to point this out. Her screen went dark and you hit her shift key.
[00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:48.080]   No, actually I hit her talk bed. I was hoping no one's going to notice that. Sorry. This is a
[00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:52.480]   nervous twitch. That is very strange. Do you do that to other people? No, I think I was like,
[00:58:52.480 --> 00:59:00.320]   why did I do that? I instantly felt bad. I know. That was really interesting. It was.
[00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:03.040]   Well, you were just doing my favor. I think this is a new thing that the kids are doing. Yeah.
[00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:06.480]   Millennials. Keep that awake. Do you do that as millennials? Do you do that for other millennials?
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:10.000]   Yeah. You make sure their machine never sleeps. I promise to never do it again. No, no, it's good.
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:13.280]   You're the wake up guy. Like they have the reply guy on Twitter. You're like the wake up guy.
[00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:17.360]   I was like waking up. I don't want to be a wife guy. I don't want to be a reply guy. And if you
[00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:20.480]   don't get those jokes, good job. You're not on Twitter too much. Megan and I apparently are on
[00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:24.400]   Twitter very much. But anyway, I apologize. It's totally fine. Thank you for pointing it out.
[00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:29.120]   Is this one of those things that didn't exist 20 years ago? 20 seconds ago. No, I think you're
[00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:33.040]   right. I think this is very modern. And that's why we have millennials on the show. You just
[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:37.440]   needed it to be. I think it's very gentlemanly personal. You're looking at my notes. You're
[00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:42.800]   looking at my notes. See, I've been creeping on her note stopping the entire time. Stealing her
[00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:46.000]   goodness. It's just like an act of shovel rig to make. I'm just going to throw it at to people.
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:49.520]   I think so. Yeah. Let me know how that would be. You should go to coffee shops and do that and
[00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:57.120]   see how it goes. Yeah. Hashtag space bar. I mean, to be fair, it was the touch. It was the
[00:59:57.120 --> 01:00:02.720]   just you know, it was a little yeah. Because it drives me nuts when your screen goes dark.
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:06.720]   And now because I'm so ADD, I have no idea what we're talking about. Oh, yes, I do. I just get
[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:11.360]   jokes about facial recognition will be joking. But basically privacy as a luxury item. Yeah.
[01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:16.240]   I think it's pretty clear. We're kind of headed to that territory where some people will have
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:21.120]   privacy just as some people have technology and then some people won't. We're already there. I mean,
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:26.480]   all of those like facial like you pointed out facial recognition is you know, it gets false
[01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:31.280]   positives. Like, you know, if you live, if you have food stamps, you're being tracked more often.
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:35.760]   Like it starts with the poor. It starts with the marginalized and you know, and then it will come
[01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:41.280]   to us. And we've already seen how it's working in situations like that. And it's not good. And if,
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:45.360]   you know, when you have to stand up and do something about it, even if it's not happening right now
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:51.200]   to us. What could we do? Well, you could do what they did in San Francisco. In fact,
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:56.320]   he was on triangulation on Friday with Denise Howell. I forgot his name. What was his name,
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:01.840]   Carsten? Do you remember an activist who got the city of San Francisco to ban face recognition
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:09.040]   within the city limits? There is a movement of foot to get face recognition off police body cams.
[01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:15.600]   I think people there is going to be a backlash. But I think ultimately this and I'll go back to
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:22.160]   that is Congress ever going to tell Google, you have to give away Gmail, but you can't charge for
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:27.040]   it. But with our information, his name is Brian Hofer. Brian Hofer, that's right. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:33.520]   I don't think Congress will ever be sufficiently educated to make effective tech policy at the
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:37.920]   edges of what's new and what's possible. So I don't think we're going to see them work in the space.
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:40.560]   I wonder if we're going to have to just slow it out and then the market.
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:44.720]   I think they're designed by the way. I think it's not a bad design by the founders to be that way,
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:52.320]   to not be quick. Yeah. Quick is a dictatorship. Quick to respond to any social movement is a
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:56.400]   dictatorship. And I think ultimately risky because you can respond too quickly.
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:02:01.200]   I think that Apple being hardcore about privacy has been good. It's good for Apple.
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:04.400]   It's also good for people who don't use Apple products because at Google I/O,
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:10.480]   Google had a lot of privacy news. They're never going to go as far as Apple does.
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:15.680]   And it won't be the default in a lot of cases. But I do believe that Google and other companies
[01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:21.120]   are offering more privacy features than they would if Apple did not exist as this arch rival,
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:26.000]   who was slugging away at them about it. Yeah. I mean, I think our expectations for privacy have
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.840]   changed. We want more. We are much more aware. But mine have. I used to argue, oh, you don't need
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:33.280]   privacy. What is everybody so worried about privacy? What's the worst that could happen?
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:39.520]   Turns out everything. I mean, that's a very privileged attitude to have. And I think we're all learning
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:44.720]   that anything can happen. Yeah. And in fact, if you turn on every privacy feature Google has,
[01:02:44.720 --> 01:02:49.200]   it's a way, way, way more private experience than if you leave everything on the default.
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:52.480]   Is it still usable? I mean, that's the balance.
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:56.720]   That's the balance. The less Google knows about you, the less useful it is. A lot of cases.
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:00.160]   I think Google's business is knowing a lot about you in a way that Apple's is not.
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:04.480]   The best thing you could ask for is give me the choice. The best thing you could say is,
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:08.400]   well, tell me what you're collecting, what you do with it, and what I'm going to lose if I turn
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:11.840]   that off. And let me choose. I think Google's moving in that direction. You know that choice.
[01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:16.160]   In some cases, it's kind of buried. And they're not tugging at your arm, asking you to make those
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:19.920]   decisions. They're happy if you don't make them, but they are there in a lot of cases.
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:24.000]   I mean, compared to Facebook, where they're actively hiding any choices that you might have,
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:29.360]   if those choices even exist. And then Apple, I think sometimes people assume Apple's more private
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:33.280]   than it truly is. We already know if you put a third party app on your iPhone,
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:41.120]   you're hackable and followable. Although they are introducing new features to make it less easy
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:44.480]   for third party apps to do stuff with your data. You don't want them to do.
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:49.360]   But remember, the WhatsApp hack that allowed somebody to call your WhatsApp app on your iPhone
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:54.800]   and have total command of it. It's not an impervious platform, I guess is what I'm saying.
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:58.160]   And there was a story in the post that detailed how often third party apps in the iPhone were
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:01.520]   reached non-pinging servers that came out with in the last month. Thousands.
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:06.640]   So one of the things Apple offered, and I'm curious to see whether the market picks this up.
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:12.080]   I noticed that Nest is not one of the cameras that will be taking advantage of Apple's new
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:19.120]   camera platform, which offers free 10-day recording, not counted against your storage limit,
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:26.320]   and end-to-end encryption. So that, and as we know, this has been a problem with Ring Doorbells
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:32.400]   and other cameras that people in the Ukraine, in the case of Ring, were able to look at your videos.
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:39.040]   Nobody could see your videos. They only have three companies so far in this group,
[01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:44.960]   Anchor's U-Fee, Logitech, and NetAtmo. And I doubt Nest would ever go along with this, partly
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:50.400]   because Nest's income comes from the fees that they charge you for recording. But also because
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:56.080]   you have to wonder how all in would estimate be on end-to-end encryption. I don't know.
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:57.520]   Maybe Goolby forced to do that.
[01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:05.840]   And the Apple stuff requires that you have a home pod or an iPad or an Apple TV.
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:08.160]   So the audience is somewhat limited for it.
[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:13.040]   There are a lot of those devices on the market, but I'm curious to see if Apple can ride this
[01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:17.200]   wave for a while and what the new and next features they can build that fit in the privacy
[01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:21.200]   model will be. And I'm curious if they're going to make us more attached to them, because I feel
[01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:25.840]   very stuck in the Mac iOS world right now, not because I'm making an active choice, but just
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:27.440]   because of habit. And this could keep me around.
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:28.800]   You're in a gated community, though.
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:33.120]   I mean, back to the point about privilege. I mean, I don't have to be on Facebook. I'm off
[01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:36.720]   of Facebook and Instagram now, so I get to have a more private life because I can get away with it.
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:40.400]   And something that can have nice devices. I feel very privileged, but maybe Apple will
[01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:42.080]   keep me around even more with this sort of stuff.
[01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:46.080]   Yeah. No, I think that's right. And I think it's a smart, certainly a smart move for Apple,
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:47.360]   from a marketing point of view.
[01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:49.360]   It's going to keep me around with the emoji makeup.
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:51.760]   Is that a big thing? Because those look fun.
[01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:54.560]   Smokey eye. Yeah.
[01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:59.520]   I thought that emoji was done when in Snapchat, and then it blew up and everyone loved it.
[01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:04.320]   So I've stopped mocking stickers and fun little images because apparently I'm way off the mark.
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:05.680]   There is.
[01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:08.240]   He grimaces.
[01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:11.200]   I'm trying not to get in trouble with Megan. She's close enough. She could hit me.
[01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:20.480]   There is kind of a weird sexism in Apple putting two female YouTube stars up to talk about
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:24.000]   the new mimeojis. Were they female? No, one of them was.
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.080]   There you go. I don't know.
[01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:28.880]   Yeah. So now you're in trouble with the guy.
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:32.000]   Yeah. Makeup. Could have fooled me.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:37.680]   Yeah. Well, okay. Let's just be fair. Gender is not immediately obvious in a mimeoji.
[01:06:37.680 --> 01:06:38.880]   Yeah.
[01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:38.880]   Yeah.
[01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:41.840]   Not as gender, especially in emoji wearing a ton of makeup.
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:42.080]   Yeah.
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:46.320]   Okay. Good. I'm showing my age and prejudice.
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:46.880]   Yeah.
[01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:48.720]   I apologize. You may get me.
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:49.680]   I think we all are.
[01:06:49.680 --> 01:06:52.240]   The anticipated your concern and aggression.
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:55.520]   No, I think the intro, the middle, the corrective role, fine there.
[01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:55.520]   Yeah.
[01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:57.600]   I thought that was a solid BB minus.
[01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:57.840]   Yeah.
[01:06:57.840 --> 01:06:59.840]   Hey, at least I didn't reach out to touch it.
[01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:00.800]   You just did.
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:00.800]   Yeah.
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:02.960]   So if you don't see the video, you miss out.
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:04.400]   I'm allowed. I own that lap.
[01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:05.920]   It's true. I've done along to him.
[01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:09.520]   I'm excited about this stuff.
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:15.360]   Okay. If we said everything there is to say about WWDC and the keynote.
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:19.680]   I mean, you know, there is a, from a purely programmers point of view,
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:22.160]   this new Swift UI thing that they announced.
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:23.440]   That got the most chairs.
[01:07:23.440 --> 01:07:24.960]   That's a developer conference.
[01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:29.520]   But it is going to make it a lot easier for even non-programmers, kids,
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:32.160]   and people who want to develop Swift apps, iOS apps,
[01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:34.560]   much easier for them to develop apps.
[01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:38.960]   It's a much more natural way to design an app right on the screen, drawing it.
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:42.400]   I think that Apple has done great work there.
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:45.200]   They've always done great work in Xcode and their interface design.
[01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:47.760]   But this is very exciting.
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:50.080]   I mean, when I was back in high school trying to learn C++,
[01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:52.560]   it was me in a dark room, trying to make a compiler work.
[01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:52.880]   Right.
[01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:54.160]   I mean, this is so much better.
[01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:55.680]   And how great to put it in the hands of kids?
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:58.000]   Yeah, and adults for that matter.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:04.160]   But I imagine, in fact, I don't know, I would think Apple would have done,
[01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:06.480]   would have always been doing this because honestly,
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:10.560]   if you have developers who are developing for your platform and your platform only,
[01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:11.760]   that is good for you, right?
[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:14.880]   So I thought that was also very important.
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:20.320]   And let's not forget that there is a tips calculator now on Apple Watch.
[01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:23.280]   Can we give like a nine out of 10?
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:25.840]   I feel like going through this list of stuff, we've all been...
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:28.000]   It's darn amazing.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:28.720]   Which is rare.
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:31.920]   You pointed out there was one negative, a thousand dollar monitor stand.
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:32.480]   That was it.
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:33.680]   What do I think did that on purpose?
[01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:36.560]   To attract all the negative commentary to one lightning rod.
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:38.960]   And the rest of it was they knew it was going to be good?
[01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:40.240]   No, no, make it a thousand dollars.
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:41.280]   People will lose their minds.
[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:43.280]   They're playing three-dimensional chess.
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:44.240]   Eight-dimensional chess.
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:46.240]   Yeah, I'm playing three.
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:47.040]   They're playing eight.
[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:47.520]   Yeah, they are.
[01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:49.040]   They're in 2134 already.
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:50.000]   Oh my gosh.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.120]   I do think that there were a few things that people have noticed,
[01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:56.320]   people using the beta that weren't announced, I found interesting.
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:08:59.200]   There's the location tracking.
[01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:02.480]   So you know how when you're using your iPhone and it says,
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:05.040]   whatever app has been tracking you, do you want to keep tracking?
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:05.040]   Yeah.
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:09.840]   And then, but now there will be a screenshot will come up and show exactly where...
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:10.800]   What it knows.
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:12.000]   Yeah, where they were tracking you.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:12.480]   That is awesome.
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:14.480]   The other thing that...
[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:15.600]   That is really...
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:17.680]   That's throwing shade at the apps, right?
[01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:18.400]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:21.600]   Saying, well, yeah, but it even showed it for, I think it was like the app store.
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:23.200]   Notice how I did that millennial thing.
[01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:24.960]   Do you kids still say throwing shade?
[01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:26.400]   Not since 2013.
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:27.520]   Not since you've said it.
[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:33.200]   Could that be the Leo rule that when he says it on Twitter, it's officially over?
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:35.040]   Grandpa's saying it stopped.
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:37.440]   Can you please say Bay so we can end that one too?
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:40.320]   Oh, well, we got it.
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:45.680]   Oh, the last one was the 3D touch is going to be gone in iOS 3 too.
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:46.000]   What?
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.120]   Is that official?
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:50.160]   Yeah, people who've been using the beta, it's gone.
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:52.160]   And so if you...
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:53.040]   It'll be a long press.
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:54.960]   So the peak and poke are the like...
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:55.680]   How low?
[01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:56.000]   Yeah.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:56.320]   I know.
[01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:59.200]   So you long press to still do it, but then the...
[01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:01.200]   So the capabilities remain, but you don't have that.
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:02.800]   You have to push really hard on the...
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:05.680]   So it's still a rumor what iOS...
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:08.240]   I mean, what iPhone 11, whether it'll have that capability.
[01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:09.120]   People look at the code to see...
[01:10:09.120 --> 01:10:11.680]   The code shows no 3D touch features.
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:12.480]   I didn't know that.
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:13.280]   That's fascinating.
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:14.960]   So we'll see.
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:18.880]   I think the only one left is the flashlight and the camera,
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:20.640]   which I didn't even know you could 3D touch,
[01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:22.080]   which is part of the problem with 3D touch.
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:22.640]   Because no one...
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:23.600]   I didn't know that either.
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:24.000]   Yeah.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.640]   That was the only thing I used 3D touch for.
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:27.280]   What does it do?
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:30.960]   If you're on the lock screen, you can quickly get into the camera
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:32.160]   or quickly turn on the flashlight.
[01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:34.240]   It's gonna try this on.
[01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:34.720]   Yeah.
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:35.440]   All right.
[01:10:35.440 --> 01:10:36.000]   So amazing.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:36.960]   Is this an all-apple show?
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:38.480]   Oh, that's amazing!
[01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:39.520]   Why don't you take this away?
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:41.920]   Well, they're not taking that one away.
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:42.560]   Oh, okay. Good.
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:42.720]   All right.
[01:10:42.720 --> 01:10:43.040]   Sorry, Leo.
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:43.600]   You can do the end.
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:43.600]   Yeah.
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:43.600]   Yeah.
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:45.600]   I think...
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:50.240]   This is why Apple is the most valuable company in the history of the world.
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:53.040]   Do you ever feel like a sheeple?
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:57.040]   I own two high-end Windows 10 gaming pieces.
[01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:57.360]   That's right.
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:10:58.080]   You're a game.
[01:10:58.080 --> 01:10:58.560]   Yeah.
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:10:59.440]   Not even much of a gamer.
[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:00.640]   I just like to live in both worlds.
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:00.880]   Yeah.
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:03.600]   Still, after this conversation,
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:06.080]   are you not gonna go home and throw away your Windows machines?
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:07.040]   No, no, no.
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:09.440]   I want a mechanical keyboard and external monitor.
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:11.840]   I want to glow red like Satan's horns.
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:12.640]   Max, don't do that.
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:13.280]   PCs do.
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:13.920]   No, that's true.
[01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:18.240]   Plus, you don't have liquid cooling and big blowers.
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.560]   And it's gonna be an intimidating form factor.
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:20.800]   Yeah.
[01:11:20.800 --> 01:11:21.920]   Not a cheese grater.
[01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:22.560]   Cheese grater.
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:24.160]   That's for the yuppies, but the cappuccinos.
[01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:25.040]   All right.
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:26.160]   We got more to talk about,
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:29.360]   including Google's Stadia Gaming Service, Mr. Gamer.
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:32.640]   But first, a word from our sponsor, Captera.
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:33.600]   Are you in business?
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:35.360]   Do you use business software?
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:37.280]   So many companies, business, for them,
[01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:41.600]   business software means something running on a Windows XP machine in the closet.
[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:43.520]   They still need IE8.
[01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:44.640]   It's the only way they can do it.
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:49.200]   There is better software for every business, modern software.
[01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:53.040]   Software, you can use a modern computer with software that works right.
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:56.080]   It's easy to use, and you can find it at Captera.
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:12:00.640]   Look, finding the right software for business can be kind of complicated.
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:01.120]   What do you do?
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:04.560]   You Google it, then you're going to get a list of a thousand programs.
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:05.760]   No additional information.
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:06.560]   It's going to be all crazy.
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:07.200]   Is this one good?
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:08.480]   I don't even know.
[01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:10.880]   Or you can call a friend, but what do they know?
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:18.640]   Captera has all the software, 700 categories in every possible area of business.
[01:12:18.640 --> 01:12:22.480]   The big ones like CRM or IT project management, E-commerce,
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:26.720]   link management tools, web conferencing, but also individuals,
[01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:30.160]   things like yoga studio management or dental office management,
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:32.720]   every possible program.
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:37.920]   And these are all brand new modern, excellent software.
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:39.200]   And you don't have to take my word for it.
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:43.760]   You could do the search, narrow it down by rating, by capabilities, the number of seats.
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:46.960]   Is it running the cloud or is it running on a hard drive, that kind of thing?
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:53.920]   Even compare them side by side, forward at time, and then the best thing, reviews,
[01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:56.560]   almost a million reviews from actual users.
[01:12:56.560 --> 01:13:01.520]   So you're going to see exactly what that program can and cannot do, how people like it.
[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:04.800]   This is the tool you've been needing all this time.
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:09.520]   Stop suffering with old, out of date, dangerous business software.
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:12.480]   Get something new for your business.
[01:13:12.480 --> 01:13:14.400]   No matter what kind of software your business needs,
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:17.440]   Captera makes it easy to discover the right solution fast.
[01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:21.760]   And once you find that perfect software, pay it forward, leave a review,

[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:31.680]   Yeah, it is an amazing deal, free.
[01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:33.360]   It's the directory of everything.
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:35.680]   And it's what you need at captera.com/twit.

[01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:49.440]   It's a brilliant idea.

[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:56.160]   Thank you for using captera.com/twit.
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:14:00.080]   So E3 is this week.
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:02.960]   What's going on right now as we speak, I believe?
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:05.360]   The Sony... Oh no, Sony's not there.
[01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:07.200]   It's the Xbox thing.
[01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:08.400]   Brad's time is from The Robles.
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:09.440]   First coffee.
[01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:10.160]   Xbox.
[01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:13.040]   There's going to be a nice purple Xbox, the Fortnite Xbox.
[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:14.400]   Something about Keanu Reeves.
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:15.600]   Always.
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:16.400]   Keanu Reeves there?
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:20.880]   Keanu Reeves is going to be in Cyberpunk 2077,
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:27.920]   the best game that most anticipated game possibly in E3.
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:31.360]   It doesn't sound like an A-list title, to be honest.
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:34.080]   It's made by the people who made The Witcher 3.
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:34.960]   Oh, that's good.
[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:38.400]   Best games of this generation.
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:40.720]   Can we just get Carson on the show?
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:41.040]   Yeah.
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:42.160]   Carson's pretty amazing.
[01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:45.680]   One of the best games of this generation.
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:46.560]   I'll do the cameras.
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:47.440]   Keanu Reeves is...
[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:49.760]   You know, we're in a big E3 show next week,
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:52.400]   so we'll have some people who know what they're talking about.
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:53.040]   Yes, that's right.
[01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:54.560]   So we'll after E3.
[01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:58.240]   So this is a little teaser of...
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:01.360]   What was it, Cyberpunk 2077?
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:01.920]   Yes.
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:04.400]   Kind of looks like a little play-brenery here.
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:04.880]   Yes.
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:07.120]   But watch for the guy getting out of the car,
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:09.600]   because you might be somebody you recognize.
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:11.920]   No, he's at the very end of this.
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:12.560]   He's at the end?
[01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:13.120]   He's at the end of this.
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:14.240]   He's the hero.
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:16.720]   No, he's the guy that the hero works for,
[01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:18.000]   or something like that.
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:18.720]   Oh, you're kidding.
[01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:19.200]   He's not even...
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:20.720]   You don't even get to be Keanu?
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:24.080]   No, I think I couldn't tell exactly from the voice,
[01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:25.520]   but I think you might be...
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:28.400]   What's his face from Breaking Bad?
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:30.000]   Excuse me, but all these games look...
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:30.640]   Breaking Bad.
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:31.840]   You think that's Aaron Paul?
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:32.880]   I think that's...
[01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:34.080]   Does he say "yo" a lot?
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:36.960]   It sounded like the voice of Aaron Paul, but I'm not...
[01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:37.760]   Oh, I think you're right.
[01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:38.240]   No, wait a minute.
[01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:39.200]   I think Aaron Paul is in this.
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:40.560]   Let's turn up the sound.
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:41.840]   All right, I'll turn up your sound.
[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:42.480]   Yeah.
[01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:44.640]   And I think that's Mr. T, right?
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:47.600]   All right, start it up, Berg.
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:49.680]   Why don't you go...
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:51.920]   Let me go back to the kid.
[01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:54.480]   So he's going into the...
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:54.800]   Yeah.
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:56.960]   Vee my man.
[01:15:56.960 --> 01:15:58.880]   You made it.
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:00.800]   You blown up all over the news.
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:01.520]   Are you alone?
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:03.600]   Since you just want the money.
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:04.960]   Yeah, that sounds like your...
[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:05.840]   You got the chip.
[01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:08.800]   All right.
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:09.520]   It's a lot of bass.
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:10.080]   I'm gonna get you up, Berg.
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:13.200]   So why don't you go to the bathroom?
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:14.080]   Wash up.
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:15.360]   We gonna be wit you in a minute.
[01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:17.600]   Come on, man.
[01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:18.320]   You're neck.
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:19.200]   It's a mess.
[01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:22.960]   So, Carson, what makes this...
[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:25.760]   the game of a generation?
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:29.920]   It looks like every other game I've ever seen.
[01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:32.720]   It does, but the developer CD Project Red
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:37.440]   has a phenomenal track record with the Witcher series.
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:38.560]   Witcher's good.
[01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:39.200]   I like what you...
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:44.560]   They are very independent of not falling into the traps of many...
[01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:45.680]   You're saying it's not EA.
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:47.840]   There's no loot boxes in this.
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:48.640]   No loot boxes.
[01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:49.280]   Look at this.
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:51.840]   Actually, the rendering looks good, but it is a cutscene.
[01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:52.480]   I mean, it's not.
[01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:55.120]   But I want Keanu.
[01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:58.000]   I just can't believe Keanu went from always be my maybe
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:01.440]   right back to dystopian gunfights.
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:02.160]   Yeah, wow.
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:03.200]   That is artistic way.
[01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:04.800]   He's the king of the Matrix, man.
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:06.720]   Oh, I missed him.
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:07.760]   No, no, it's coming.
[01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:08.560]   He's at the end?
[01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:09.360]   He's at the very end.
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:09.920]   Oh, okay.
[01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:10.960]   Oh, we shot the friend.
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:13.360]   Okay, here it comes.
[01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:15.920]   Okay, that works.
[01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:18.400]   We have a little bird.
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:21.600]   Oh, it's Keanu!
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:23.600]   Is he safe?
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:23.920]   Whoa.
[01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:26.960]   Whoa.
[01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:31.920]   So, he's really got a cameo right at the very end there.
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:33.120]   Okay, that's cool.
[01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:34.880]   All right, I'll play it, and if it's not good,
[01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:36.240]   I'll just burn Carson's house done.
[01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:36.640]   Yeah.
[01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:37.040]   There we go.
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:38.240]   Sounds good.
[01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:40.080]   It won't be out.
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:42.320]   Okay, this is the thing I hate about E3.
[01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:42.960]   Take a guess.
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:43.920]   No, don't show it.
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:44.640]   Take a guess.
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:46.160]   You didn't see it.
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:46.720]   I didn't see it.
[01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:47.200]   Take a guess.
[01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:48.400]   When will this game be out?
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:49.280]   It was just announced.
[01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:50.000]   Yeah.
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:53.760]   I mean, my heart says January, 2020.
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:55.520]   April 16th, 2020.
[01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:57.600]   That's a game you're just taking
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:17:59.840]   to moves in slow motion compared to consumer like codes.
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:01.840]   This is a game that was announced in 2013.
[01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:02.240]   Yeah, they've-
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:02.880]   What?
[01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:03.200]   Yes.
[01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:03.680]   Yeah.
[01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:04.240]   This is-
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:04.640]   It's too good.
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:06.000]   You can come forever, dude.
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:07.520]   This is-
[01:18:07.520 --> 01:18:09.920]   Stuke Nuka meets Keanu Reeves.
[01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:10.640]   I mean, there's-
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:10.880]   Okay.
[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:12.400]   Well, are you excited about Stadia?
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:12.880]   This is-
[01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:13.280]   So we-
[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:14.960]   The other shoe dropped on Stadia.
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:15.440]   You guys-
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:15.840]   Uh-
[01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:17.200]   Jason Hall and Megan
[01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:18.640]   talked about this Thursday morning.
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:19.680]   You showed the Stadia event.
[01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:20.320]   Was it a good event?
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:21.120]   Was it interesting?
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:22.640]   Uh, it was not a live event.
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:23.600]   It was like recorded.
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:24.080]   No, please.
[01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:25.200]   And we just watched it.
[01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:25.520]   So-
[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:26.480]   I'm so sorry.
[01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:27.280]   And I had-
[01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:29.520]   I guess I wasn't following along closely enough,
[01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:30.960]   because Jason had to point out at the end of the event
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:32.880]   that it's not a Netflix for gaming.
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:35.120]   Like, it's not an all-you-can game.
[01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:35.760]   You still have to buy-
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:36.480]   That's what's weird.
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:38.720]   Well, it wasn't clear when they first announced it,
[01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:39.360]   because of course,
[01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:43.040]   Microsoft and Sony and others are already doing this kind of streaming
[01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:44.640]   gaming thing where you pay a flat fee.
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:45.680]   Even Apple is-
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:47.520]   Even Apple with Arcade Plus.
[01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:51.280]   But, uh, Stadia, you buy the game.
[01:18:51.280 --> 01:18:52.240]   Like, for 60 bucks.
[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:53.040]   Like, it's not even-
[01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:53.840]   Yeah.
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:55.520]   But it doesn't install any system.
[01:18:55.520 --> 01:18:55.840]   You can-
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:56.320]   In fact, the-
[01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:57.680]   The Founders Edition
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:18:59.920]   is a Chromecast Ultra
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:02.160]   and three months of service.
[01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:05.520]   And then this special controller that they're making,
[01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:07.600]   which looks like everybody else's controller.
[01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:09.680]   And the idea is you don't get a gaming console.
[01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:10.880]   They run it on their servers.
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:13.520]   It is a little weird, though, that you would-
[01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:14.960]   So this is 130 bucks.
[01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:16.400]   You spend 130 bucks.
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:18.000]   All you get is a Chromecast Ultra.
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:19.600]   You don't get a gaming system.
[01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:20.640]   And a- and a controller.
[01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:22.720]   And then you have to buy games.
[01:19:22.720 --> 01:19:22.960]   The-
[01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:24.240]   You do get the first game,
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:25.760]   Destiny 2 free.
[01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:26.960]   Can I talk about that for a second?
[01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:27.360]   Yeah.
[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:28.560]   Destiny 2 rocks.
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:30.000]   And I spent several hundred hours
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.280]   getting my butt kicked to that game.
[01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:32.240]   But you already played it.
[01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:32.720]   It's-
[01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:33.280]   It's two years old.
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:34.240]   Everyone should play it.
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:35.040]   It's great.
[01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:35.840]   But it's old.
[01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:36.240]   So-
[01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:38.320]   But I mean, you don't have to have a gaming system, right?
[01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:39.120]   Like that's what is-
[01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:39.680]   That's the point.
[01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:41.760]   Because like you already have two big rigs
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:42.480]   that you've been talking about.
[01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:43.840]   Yeah, who's gonna play this?
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:44.000]   Because-
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.120]   Stadia is not aimed at me.
[01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:45.920]   I mean-
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:46.880]   Who is it aimed at?
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:48.720]   My colleague Jared Newman did a story
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:52.320]   where he basically said that gamers
[01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:54.960]   don't seem to have a big problem with buying gaming consoles.
[01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:58.560]   Oh, you can get an Xbox for a couple hundred bucks.
[01:19:58.560 --> 01:19:59.520]   And who does that leave?
[01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:00.720]   Essentially, it was this question.
[01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:03.200]   And last stadium turns out to be something more than
[01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:06.880]   existing games available in streaming form.
[01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:08.800]   Well, they released a list and it looks like,
[01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:10.800]   you know, a lot of the big games NBA 2K,
[01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:13.600]   Borderlands 3, Mortal Kombat 11.
[01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:15.280]   They have one in simulator 19.
[01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:15.760]   Say again?
[01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:17.520]   Farming simulator 19.
[01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:18.960]   It's not a joke, it's on the list.
[01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:20.400]   Did you say farming simulator 19?
[01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:22.160]   Farming simulator 19.
[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:22.560]   Sorry, but-
[01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:24.960]   Is it the 19th edition of farming simulator?
[01:20:24.960 --> 01:20:25.600]   I believe so.
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:28.160]   They're also talking about maybe eventually having games
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:29.840]   that do things consoles can't do.
[01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:30.480]   I'm very big in Germany.
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:30.880]   Like what?
[01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:32.000]   I didn't really say.
[01:20:33.120 --> 01:20:35.520]   Can you see the mystery features down the road?
[01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:35.760]   Yeah.
[01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:40.720]   They talked about at the original announcement back at GDC,
[01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:41.680]   the idea that you-
[01:20:41.680 --> 01:20:42.960]   I mean, there's some interesting things.
[01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:46.000]   For instance, you could have multiple servers in the Google
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.680]   Cloud running your game.
[01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:51.600]   You could have, if you're doing couch gaming, cooperative gaming,
[01:20:51.600 --> 01:20:54.240]   I could have my server on my side of the screen.
[01:20:54.240 --> 01:20:56.240]   You could have your server running on your side of the screen.
[01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:58.080]   So performance might be really good.
[01:20:58.080 --> 01:20:59.280]   But what they really didn't address,
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:01.920]   and they still haven't addressed is this issue of latency.
[01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:04.320]   Because you make this great thing with all-
[01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:06.720]   Yeah, let's assume it's a great thing with lots of great games
[01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:07.920]   at a fair price.
[01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:10.240]   And then Comcast gets a hold of it,
[01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:12.480]   and it controls the whole thing.
[01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:14.000]   Call me!
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:15.040]   Call me!
[01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:18.320]   Last night, I was playing Apex Legends with a friend of mine,
[01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:21.120]   and my Comcast internet connection just blipped for a second,
[01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:22.160]   and I got dumped-
[01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:22.640]   Game over, man.
[01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:23.440]   Game over!
[01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:24.240]   I got dropped and dumped.
[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:25.200]   I had to reboot the whole thing.
[01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:25.680]   It was a mess.
[01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:29.520]   And I pay for a really fast SF Comcast connection.
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:31.360]   I think the fastest one I can.
[01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:33.760]   And it's just not consistent enough to even run a PS4.
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:36.080]   So I don't want to use this because I don't trust it yet,
[01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:38.000]   but I love the idea of it,
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.400]   a way to constantly upgrade the backend,
[01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:42.800]   the equivalent of the console over time to play better games.
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:43.360]   Fantastic.
[01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:44.400]   I love the idea.
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:46.960]   I just wonder if we have the broadband network
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:47.840]   needed to power this.
[01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:50.160]   That is kind of the Achilles heel of this whole thing.
[01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:51.920]   And this idea has been around for so long.
[01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:53.040]   Remember on Live?
[01:21:53.040 --> 01:21:53.760]   On Live, yeah.
[01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:55.440]   That was like a decade ago, I think.
[01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:56.320]   Pretty much.
[01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:58.320]   Well, Google had Google Fiber, and they gave that up.
[01:21:58.320 --> 01:22:00.400]   And a guy-kai, was that what it was called?
[01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:03.360]   The Sony bought that for their streaming service.
[01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:06.080]   Google does say that this is way better than what we've seen before.
[01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:08.800]   And if anybody could do that, it'd be Google.
[01:22:08.800 --> 01:22:10.960]   Although, let's hope they don't accidentally
[01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:13.520]   misconfigure it and bring the whole thing down for a day.
[01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:16.400]   This happened last week during Twitch.
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:18.880]   We were talking to Google's down, Google's down, Google's down.
[01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:20.480]   Well, now we don't know a whole lot more,
[01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:26.000]   but Google's explanation is that they had a configuration
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.720]   that they were just going to put on a few servers, and somebody-
[01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:34.560]   whoops, put it on all the servers, which caused the servers to use
[01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:36.480]   less than half the normal amount of bandwidth.
[01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:40.000]   And then everybody all piled onto that bandwidth,
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.920]   making it unusably slow.
[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:46.080]   But the worst part of this is, it slowed down the Google Cloud,
[01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:50.000]   which the engineers needed to use in order to fix it.
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:55.680]   So they were de-dossed out of their own fix, which is why it went on most of the day.
[01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:59.040]   They said it wasn't a hacker, it wasn't a bad guy.
[01:22:59.040 --> 01:22:59.920]   It was an oops.
[01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:03.280]   How can that still happen?
[01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:04.800]   Yeah, that's a good question.
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:07.440]   I don't know anything about how networks work, to be totally clear.
[01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:10.640]   I know that Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud are things that exist in the world.
[01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:12.400]   That's great. I use them implicitly.
[01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:15.280]   However, how can you accidentally take down Europe?
[01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:19.840]   People have- so I'm reading the hacker news thread on this,
[01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:24.080]   and people pointed out, you know, Juniper networks on their big routers,
[01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:27.200]   they have a feature just like you do on Windows.
[01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:28.560]   You guys on Mac don't need it.
[01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:32.400]   But on Windows, when you change the resolution of your monitor,
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:35.040]   it says, "Okay, I'm going to change it."
[01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:39.280]   But if you don't say, "Okay, in 45 seconds, I'm reverting back,"
[01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:41.680]   because maybe you screwed it up and you can't see anything.
[01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:45.360]   Juniper networks, when you make a change to the network configuration,
[01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:47.440]   it says, "Okay, but I'm going to revert in 30 seconds,
[01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:49.920]   I'm going to do it again in a revert in two minutes."
[01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:51.280]   And eventually it'll stick.
[01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:54.560]   Seems like that might be a little thing you could add, Google.
[01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:56.080]   They needed, "Are you sure about them?"
[01:23:56.080 --> 01:23:56.800]   Yeah.
[01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:58.160]   "Are you really sure?"
[01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:00.720]   Or just like, if that didn't work, revert back,
[01:24:00.720 --> 01:24:02.720]   or just revert back unless you say it's working.
[01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:04.560]   I don't know, maybe they have that.
[01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:06.960]   But it took down like Snapchat and a bunch of other services,
[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:08.080]   like, "Well, this goes down."
[01:24:08.080 --> 01:24:09.440]   Right, exactly.
[01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:10.800]   Not just Gmail going down.
[01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:15.120]   So imagine you're in the middle of a hot Fortnite battle,
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:16.080]   or I'm sorry-
[01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:16.800]   Destiny 2.
[01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:17.840]   Destiny 2, panel.
[01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:18.800]   Apex Legends.
[01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:20.000]   Apex Legends.
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.040]   You're playing PUBG.
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:21.920]   And-
[01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:24.400]   Now we're just saying names.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.920]   And it goes down.
[01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:28.800]   You're dead, dude.
[01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:30.480]   You know what, though?
[01:24:30.480 --> 01:24:33.360]   I'm not young enough to have an ego about my game performance.
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:34.000]   You don't care that much.
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:34.560]   You don't care that much.
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:36.560]   I'm just talking to some friends and trying to not think about
[01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:37.760]   like Twitter for an hour,
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:40.240]   and then I'm going to go back and read some analytics for work.
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:40.720]   You know?
[01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:41.600]   It's just a break.
[01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:42.880]   So would you get Stadia,
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:45.840]   especially as somebody with gaming consoles on different-
[01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:47.520]   or gaming PCs on different coasts?
[01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:50.720]   When I thought it was, the Netflix for games, I was in.
[01:24:50.720 --> 01:24:52.800]   But now that it's just my PS4,
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:54.720]   somewhere further away down the Comcast pipe,
[01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:55.600]   I'm less interested.
[01:24:55.600 --> 01:24:56.640]   I'm not saying no.
[01:24:56.640 --> 01:24:58.880]   I'm definitely willing to support new things in gaming
[01:24:58.880 --> 01:24:59.680]   because I think it's cool.
[01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:02.880]   But I'm not going to buy the founder's package
[01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:03.760]   or whatever it was called.
[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:06.400]   By the way, a survey says,
[01:25:06.400 --> 01:25:08.160]   "Men don't talk to one another."
[01:25:08.160 --> 01:25:10.960]   Because we don't like to go on the phone.
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:14.000]   Unless we're playing games.
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:15.200]   Where did I see this?
[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:16.640]   Men are so chatty.
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:17.280]   I'm gay.
[01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:18.960]   Let me tell you.
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:19.840]   They have so many thoughts.
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:21.840]   Like, do my shoe broke and I don't know.
[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:23.840]   Like, they just go on and on and on.
[01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:25.120]   If my friend Holden sees this,
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:25.920]   I'll know what I'm talking about.
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:27.760]   I'll listen to him talk all the time on games.
[01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:28.480]   But it's great.
[01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:29.760]   You just can tell us how you-
[01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:30.320]   It's how you rely on-
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:33.920]   And you know, as an older gentleman of a certain age,
[01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:36.480]   I have to report that in my day,
[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:39.360]   well, we didn't have PUBG Fortnite Destiny 2.
[01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:40.160]   And what is it?
[01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:40.960]   Apex Legends.
[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:41.280]   There you go.
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:44.880]   We played games like Poker or Bridge.
[01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:47.280]   And you would get together with the guys
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:48.560]   once a week you'd play poker.
[01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:49.920]   And that was your social life.
[01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:52.960]   I currently host a regular poker game in your old house, Leo.
[01:25:52.960 --> 01:25:53.760]   That's still a thing.
[01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:56.800]   Look under the chair.
[01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:58.880]   No, but-
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:00.080]   There's an extra ace.
[01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:01.280]   I taped it to the bottom.
[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:02.880]   We've changed out the chair since you lived there, but-
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:03.440]   Oh, okay.
[01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:04.960]   I think poker is still really good.
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:06.960]   I just think also everyone's a lot busier than they used to be.
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:09.040]   And so it's much harder to have a standing Thursday game.
[01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:10.240]   You don't have to go anywhere to play these games.
[01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:11.200]   You're playing in your home.
[01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:12.960]   And you can push the time back before by 30 minutes.
[01:26:12.960 --> 01:26:13.680]   Yeah.
[01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:14.960]   And I know you're not a 14-year-old,
[01:26:14.960 --> 01:26:18.160]   but that is exactly what my 14-year-old does as well.
[01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:19.280]   Like, he has five friends.
[01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:21.120]   They play Fortnite together.
[01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:22.400]   Like, if I go in at any time,
[01:26:22.400 --> 01:26:24.080]   they have the game and then they have like,
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:27.360]   they're also on FaceTime talking with each other.
[01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:28.880]   Yeah.
[01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:30.000]   And my daughter does the same things
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:30.720]   that without the game.
[01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:31.680]   They're just talking to each other.
[01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:32.320]   Yeah.
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:32.800]   They don't mean-
[01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:33.360]   I was-
[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:37.760]   Yeah, women and girls just don't mind talking to each other.
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:39.280]   But guys, we don't for some reason.
[01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:40.960]   So we have to have an organized activity
[01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:42.160]   that we're participating in-
[01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:43.840]   Like watching a football game.
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:44.000]   Yeah.
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:47.120]   Well, we're not told that we're allowed to just talk about things.
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:48.320]   We're told that we're supposed to be buttoned up.
[01:26:48.320 --> 01:26:49.920]   And games unlock that a little bit.
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:50.880]   And I think it's healthy.
[01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:52.880]   And gaming is not the healthiest thing for young kids.
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:55.360]   But I think the conversational element for boys probably is.
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:56.320]   Yeah.
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:58.960]   I asked my son, Henry, he's 24.
[01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:00.960]   What are you-
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:02.080]   He's very social.
[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:02.880]   What do you guys-
[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:03.440]   What do you do?
[01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:05.200]   Because they're-
[01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:07.600]   He's always with his buddies partying and stuff.
[01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:08.800]   What do you talk about?
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:10.240]   So mostly we make fun of each other.
[01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:15.040]   And I think that's probably mostly what you do on Apex Legends, right?
[01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:16.080]   Yeah, because I'm terrible.
[01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:17.120]   And so I always die in-
[01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:18.320]   Just a lot of smackers talking.
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:18.560]   Right?
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:19.120]   Just a lot of-
[01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:19.360]   Yeah.
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:20.480]   Self-smack.
[01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:21.600]   Because it's like, oh, I'm so terrible.
[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:22.000]   Why do I-
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:22.880]   Oh, you've got-
[01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:23.840]   I should delete my own game.
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:24.400]   Yeah.
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:26.240]   You've got the defensive smack.
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:26.560]   Yeah.
[01:27:26.560 --> 01:27:28.640]   Well, I mean, I'm not good.
[01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:28.960]   So-
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:31.280]   I only brought that up because I just read-
[01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:32.640]   But you know, this is known for years.
[01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:34.480]   But I just read a story about-
[01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:36.880]   Oh, like they've like they discovered this.
[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:38.240]   Men don't like to talk on the phone,
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:39.600]   but they'll talk during games.
[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:42.080]   Somebody just-
[01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:42.400]   Wow.
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:44.320]   You didn't know that, huh?
[01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:45.360]   It's okay, you guys.
[01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:45.840]   It's okay.
[01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:46.720]   It's okay to talk.
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:48.160]   It's okay to cry.
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:48.800]   I don't know.
[01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:50.320]   Trying to get the sound out of you?
[01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:50.800]   No.
[01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:51.360]   I think-
[01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:53.440]   I think all the men in this table are the chatty variety.
[01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:53.840]   In general.
[01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:54.400]   Yeah.
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:27:55.440]   That's why we're on the chatty show.
[01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:56.080]   I know.
[01:27:56.080 --> 01:27:57.600]   I come on Twitter so I can be chatty.
[01:27:57.600 --> 01:27:58.080]   Yeah.
[01:27:58.080 --> 01:27:59.280]   You and I are more alike.
[01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:00.400]   Men just talk on podcasts.
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:00.720]   Yeah.
[01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:02.320]   I get home and I'm dead silent.
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:03.200]   Let's see a word.
[01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:04.240]   There's a non-gamer.
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:04.880]   No, a gamer.
[01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:05.760]   Yeah, what do you have to-
[01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:06.320]   What do you-
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:07.200]   What do you do Harry?
[01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:08.160]   You don't talk to anybody.
[01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:10.560]   Well, I said at work not talking to people.
[01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:12.560]   You're just like me.
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:15.280]   But your work is talking to people.
[01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:15.520]   Yeah.
[01:28:15.520 --> 01:28:17.840]   You know, you say too,
[01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:19.280]   but it's really more talking at people.
[01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:20.240]   It's true.
[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:20.960]   Yeah.
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:21.840]   They don't talk back.
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:23.280]   That's why podcasting is so much fun.
[01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:23.680]   It's so great.
[01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:24.640]   It's a one way to-
[01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:25.200]   How did I get-
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:26.240]   Why am I in radio?
[01:28:26.240 --> 01:28:27.680]   Because no one talks back to me.
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:28.880]   Yeah.
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:30.640]   They just have to sit and listen.
[01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:34.160]   As I gas on and on and on.
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:38.080]   You know, this week there was so much great gas.
[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:39.680]   We've made a little movie about it.
[01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:40.800]   Would you like to see it?
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:41.280]   I'd love to.
[01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:41.760]   Okay.
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:42.320]   I'd love to.
[01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:43.360]   It's to throw boy.
[01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:43.840]   That's a great decision.
[01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:46.080]   He's at it again, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:46.560]   Look at that.
[01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:47.440]   Is that huge?
[01:28:47.440 --> 01:28:48.000]   That's huge.
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:48.480]   Like an iPhone.
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:50.320]   A little iPhone throw pillow.
[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:52.240]   So there is a headphone jack.
[01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:53.520]   Yes.
[01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:54.960]   That's because it's the original.
[01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:55.600]   That's the head.
[01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:55.600]   There is.
[01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:57.040]   This is the original iPhone.
[01:28:57.040 --> 01:28:59.040]   Windows Weekly.
[01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:03.280]   Did you get to see any of the WWDC events on Monday?
[01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:06.560]   Microsoft actually played a fairly big role
[01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:08.160]   in the keynote,
[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:10.640]   and I don't believe was mentioned even once.
[01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:12.720]   All about Andrew.
[01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:12.960]   It's true.
[01:29:12.960 --> 01:29:13.120]   They sure-
[01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:15.200]   There is the Motorola Z4.
[01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:16.560]   It looks very familiar,
[01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:19.760]   but they did pack some impressive updates within it.
[01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:22.000]   Mac Break Weekly.
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.320]   We've got some sort of weird augmented reality,
[01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:26.080]   Mac Pro, on the table here,
[01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:28.000]   replacing the old cheese grater.
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:29.360]   That looks pretty sweet.
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:30.720]   I think we maybe have to buy one.
[01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:33.360]   This week in Computer Hardware.
[01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:35.600]   Are the connections to the monitor routed through that stamp?
[01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:36.960]   Like when you lock the stand in places,
[01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:38.320]   it like doing all the power.
[01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:40.480]   So you had a thousand dollars, Johnny.
[01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:42.000]   To build the perfect stand.
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:42.720]   You blew it.
[01:29:43.520 --> 01:29:46.640]   Apparently the perfect stand is a whole lot of margin.
[01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:47.360]   Twit.
[01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:49.600]   Tell your boss it's job related.
[01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:53.440]   By the way, that's another funny thing about that monitor.
[01:29:53.440 --> 01:29:54.960]   It doesn't have an HDMI port.
[01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:55.520]   What does it have?
[01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:57.600]   It has a proprietary connection.
[01:29:57.600 --> 01:29:59.280]   That's just brutal.
[01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:00.240]   It does.
[01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:02.880]   Does it have the verse amount, or do you have to buy that?
[01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:03.680]   No, you have to buy that.
[01:30:03.680 --> 01:30:04.720]   It has no mount.
[01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:09.120]   If you buy the $6,000 Mac Pro and the $5,000 monitor,
[01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:09.600]   you just have to-
[01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:10.320]   And you don't get to stand.
[01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:11.840]   You have to lean the monitor on the Mac Pro.
[01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:13.680]   Like a savage.
[01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:17.600]   It's so sad.
[01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:19.440]   It's so much money for no functionality.
[01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:20.000]   For zero.
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:20.400]   Amazing.
[01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:21.600]   Zippity-doo-dah.
[01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:23.360]   I showed today brought to you by Wordpress.
[01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:24.720]   That's where I make my home on the net.
[01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:25.920]   Everybody should have a home on the net.
[01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:27.440]   Now, I'm going to talk about your Facebook feed,
[01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:28.480]   or your Twitter feed.
[01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:29.600]   Or you should-
[01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:30.960]   You find to have those.
[01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:34.720]   I say this especially to younger people
[01:30:34.720 --> 01:30:36.080]   who might think,
[01:30:36.080 --> 01:30:37.120]   "Oh, I got Snapchat.
[01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:38.000]   I don't need a website.
[01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:39.200]   You need a website.
[01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:40.080]   You need a website.
[01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:41.440]   That's the place you put your best stuff.
[01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:44.080]   That's your persona on the internet.
[01:30:44.080 --> 01:30:45.680]   And the best place to make that website,
[01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:47.040]   wordpress.com.
[01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:49.440]   First of all, because it's powerful.
[01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:50.640]   It's easy.
[01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:51.920]   They do the hosting.
[01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:53.280]   They do the updates.
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:54.960]   They've got great site building tools.
[01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:56.320]   They've got thousands of themes.
[01:30:56.320 --> 01:30:58.160]   And they have incredible support.
[01:30:58.160 --> 01:31:02.720]   24/7 from actual WordPress experts.
[01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:06.160]   300 people who live and breathe WordPress.
[01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:08.480]   So you're getting support from somebody
[01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:11.040]   really knows their stuff anytime.
[01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:12.240]   I love that.
[01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:14.800]   And WordPress is free to start.
[01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:15.680]   So if you're saying,
[01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:16.880]   "Well, I'm a teenager.
[01:31:16.880 --> 01:31:18.160]   You know, I can't afford-
[01:31:18.160 --> 01:31:18.880]   No, start.
[01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:20.160]   Get that website up."
[01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:22.480]   As you grow, of course WordPress will grow with you.
[01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:24.480]   I've grown into the business plan,
[01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:26.960]   because I have lots of plugins I like to use,
[01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:29.200]   lots of themes I like to use.
[01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:32.080]   WordPress was started so anyone can publish their ideas.
[01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:35.280]   And wordpress.com is the perfect embodiment
[01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:36.960]   of the WordPress philosophy.
[01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:38.560]   No two-week trials,
[01:31:38.560 --> 01:31:40.320]   no hidden fees.
[01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:41.600]   And most importantly,
[01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:43.120]   the reason you want this website
[01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:45.360]   is because you own your own content
[01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:46.640]   and you own it forever.
[01:31:46.640 --> 01:31:47.680]   Upload anything you want.
[01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:49.200]   Text, pictures, video.
[01:31:49.200 --> 01:31:50.320]   Put it on WordPress.
[01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:52.720]   And then you can put it on other places.
[01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:54.720]   But it's got to live where you own it.
[01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:55.840]   You can download it anytime.
[01:31:55.840 --> 01:31:56.560]   You're never stuck.
[01:31:56.560 --> 01:31:59.600]   WordPress is so powerful, so flexible.
[01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:01.520]   Many of the biggest companies on Earth use it
[01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:02.880]   to build their websites.
[01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:05.600]   Fortune.com, Quartz uses it.
[01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:07.760]   Millions of people, you use it.
[01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:08.560]   Harry just told us.
[01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:10.160]   Fast companies use it.
[01:32:10.160 --> 01:32:12.720]   Millions of people use wordpress.com every day
[01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:14.560]   to turn their dreams into reality.
[01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:15.920]   You should too.
[01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:19.200]   I'm on a really a campaign, a kick,
[01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:22.320]   to get young people, especially teenagers in high school,
[01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:23.440]   to create websites.
[01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:26.000]   Because that's where you live.
[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:27.760]   And that's what, for the rest of your life,
[01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:29.760]   that's what people are going to find when they Google you.
[01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:32.720]   And by the way, it also applies to any business.
[01:32:32.720 --> 01:32:34.800]   If you're in business and you don't have a website,
[01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:37.440]   you practically don't exist.
[01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:39.200]   Go to wordpress.com/twit.
[01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:41.360]   You'll get 15% off any new plan purchase.
[01:32:41.360 --> 01:32:43.120]   Wordpress.com/twit.
[01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:45.360]   15% off your brand new website.
[01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:47.120]   I have a huge soft spot for WordPress.
[01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:48.400]   Ran my own server for years.
[01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:51.200]   Discovered wordpress.com 12 years ago.
[01:32:51.200 --> 01:32:53.120]   Said, "Why am I running my own server?
[01:32:53.120 --> 01:32:53.600]   It's cheaper.
[01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:55.200]   I'll let them do all the work."
[01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:56.320]   And I've been there ever since.
[01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:56.960]   It is awesome.
[01:32:56.960 --> 01:32:58.480]   LeoLaport.com's my site.
[01:32:58.480 --> 01:32:59.120]   What's yours?
[01:32:59.120 --> 01:33:02.160]   WordPress.com/twit.
[01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:03.920]   We thank WordPress for supporting Twit.
[01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:06.720]   And thank you for supporting us by using that.
[01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:10.000]   Let's talk about YouTube a little bit.
[01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:14.400]   You know, earlier I was talking about how great it is
[01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:16.160]   that if you have the talent and the interest,
[01:33:16.160 --> 01:33:19.920]   you don't need to spend a lot of money to create.
[01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:22.240]   And YouTube is absolutely a big part of that.
[01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:25.840]   You know, these youngsters don't remember it, Harry.
[01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:27.760]   But when we were young and the internet started out,
[01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:30.560]   we were excited because it broke down the barriers,
[01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:31.440]   the gatekeepers.
[01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:32.960]   What are you laughing at?
[01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:35.120]   I'm on the youngster side.
[01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:36.960]   That's the cool kid table.
[01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:38.400]   And this is where the grownups live.
[01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:40.560]   So I'm going to ignore you.
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:42.880]   That's turning just much lower up here than yours over there.
[01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:43.840]   But it's good.
[01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:44.800]   It's $105.
[01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:49.840]   But YouTube has a dark side, you know?
[01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:50.960]   All right.
[01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:52.480]   I am on a campaign.
[01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:55.360]   To me, the biggest problem with YouTube
[01:33:55.360 --> 01:33:56.640]   is the recommendation engine.
[01:33:56.640 --> 01:33:58.480]   It's what everybody knows.
[01:33:58.480 --> 01:34:00.880]   It's what, in fact, there was a New York Times article this Sunday
[01:34:00.880 --> 01:34:03.840]   about a kid, 21-year-old who started watching
[01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:07.440]   an innocuous videos on YouTube and got sucked down the rabbit hole
[01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:08.560]   into right-wing videos.
[01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:11.040]   And then I don't know how it sucked into the rabbit hole
[01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:12.000]   and left-wing videos.
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:16.160]   But it's the recommendation engine that does all that.
[01:34:16.160 --> 01:34:18.160]   Why doesn't YouTube just turn that off?
[01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:20.560]   Because, yeah, exactly.
[01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:23.440]   And they're obsessed with engagement.
[01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:25.200]   And not just how many videos you watched,
[01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:27.920]   but what percentage of the video you watched?
[01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:30.480]   What's wrong with Facebook, Google, Twitter,
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:34.240]   all of the social media is they're optimizing for engagement.
[01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:35.680]   It's the business model.
[01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:37.920]   But that's what they have to stop doing.
[01:34:37.920 --> 01:34:39.920]   Because if you just searched for a video,
[01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:43.440]   found it and watched it, that'd be the end of it.
[01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:46.400]   Instead of watching a video on how to cook a steak
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:50.880]   and then getting directed to a video on a vegetarianism
[01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:53.200]   and then getting directed to the next video on veganism
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:55.680]   and the next video on is PETA and the next...
[01:34:55.680 --> 01:34:58.640]   By the end of the line, you're doing what they just did down the road
[01:34:58.640 --> 01:35:01.440]   in Petaluma where you're liberating chickens.
[01:35:01.440 --> 01:35:04.560]   You're breaking into chicken farms and freeing the chickens.
[01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:05.520]   - That sounds good to me.
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:06.480]   - Free-range chickens.
[01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:08.080]   - You probably watched those videos.
[01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:11.120]   That's what happens though.
[01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:13.440]   - The insatiable drive of modern corporations
[01:35:13.440 --> 01:35:16.720]   to increase profit both sequential quarterly and year-of-a-year
[01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:17.360]   leads them to...
[01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:17.920]   - Well, knock it off!
[01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:20.080]   - ...beating to immoral and amoral choices.
[01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:20.400]   - Yes.
[01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:23.120]   - In Google, a company that famously said "do no evil"
[01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:25.200]   is now more beholden to its shareholders
[01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:27.360]   than it is to its principals.
[01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:29.280]   And so YouTube will not change.
[01:35:29.280 --> 01:35:31.840]   It's Susan Wojcitski, I believe.
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:35.360]   Can't turn this off because it would destroy all of her KPIs,
[01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:36.800]   all the metrics that she reports to...
[01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:37.600]   - What's the KPI?
[01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:38.800]   - Key performance indicator,
[01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:40.160]   a metric that you track over time.
[01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:43.440]   - Is it because they're publicly held that they can't do this?
[01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:44.560]   - Oh, they could do it.
[01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:45.600]   - They just won't.
[01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:46.800]   Because then they'd be worth less money.
[01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:48.800]   And then they would have less money.
[01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:49.440]   - Be fair to them.
[01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:53.920]   I also think YouTube also takes pride in being an open forum
[01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:56.720]   and at least in the past has had the attitude that,
[01:35:56.720 --> 01:35:58.960]   yes, freedom of speech does have its costs.
[01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:02.080]   You're gonna have to be comfortable with stuff.
[01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:05.920]   You're uncomfortable with being part of the deal.
[01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:08.800]   And I think they're slowly getting their head around the notion
[01:36:08.800 --> 01:36:11.840]   that that might not be the best way to look at what they're doing.
[01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:13.360]   And I think that is sincere.
[01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:13.680]   - Yes.
[01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:16.320]   Stop the recommendation engine.
[01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:17.600]   The whole thing goes away.
[01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:18.880]   It's no longer a problem.
[01:36:18.880 --> 01:36:20.240]   You can post anything you want.
[01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:21.680]   You can post anything you want.
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:23.920]   I don't end up liberating chickens
[01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:27.680]   because I haven't gone down the rabbit hole.
[01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:30.160]   I'm just watching the videos I search for and find.
[01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:33.360]   You can have Google deliver them in the search results.
[01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:36.400]   It seems to me if they really cared about this,
[01:36:36.400 --> 01:36:38.640]   maybe that's too simplistic.
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:41.760]   - I think they are doing some stuff with not doing enough.
[01:36:41.760 --> 01:36:44.880]   - They're not like not recirculating ugly stuff and making it
[01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:45.840]   so it doesn't pop up.
[01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:48.320]   - I feel like this is what the real problem is
[01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:50.160]   that Facebook, Google and these other companies
[01:36:50.160 --> 01:36:52.800]   pay lip service to this idea of fixing it.
[01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:55.280]   But they're not willing to really fix it.
[01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:58.080]   So they have these band-aids that honestly,
[01:36:58.080 --> 01:36:59.200]   I don't think they really do.
[01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:01.840]   - They also make decisions and then undo them
[01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:05.280]   and then make the same mistake again and have to undo it again.
[01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:08.400]   And the stuff with this guy, Steven Crowder,
[01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:10.480]   where they said that he had not violated,
[01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:12.400]   he was doing this homophobic stuff.
[01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:13.840]   - A louder with Crowder.
[01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:14.560]   - Right.
[01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:16.000]   - He's like a shock jock.
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:17.680]   If you watch him, he doesn't look so different
[01:37:17.680 --> 01:37:19.520]   from stuff you might have seen on the radio.
[01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:23.040]   But he was dissing a Vox columnist who's gay
[01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:24.800]   and he was calling him a lisper
[01:37:24.800 --> 01:37:26.960]   and he was making fun of his national origins.
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:27.840]   - Carlos Manzo.
[01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:31.040]   - It was bullied, which they have banned in their TLS.
[01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:32.960]   But they are more concerned about pissing off
[01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:34.480]   the conservative media salesman.
[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:35.440]   - No, but they can make a case.
[01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:36.160]   You can make a case.
[01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:37.440]   Well, look, it's free speech.
[01:37:37.440 --> 01:37:38.400]   It's shock jock.
[01:37:38.400 --> 01:37:40.880]   Then don't have a no bullying clause.
[01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:42.000]   Leo, you can't have it both ways.
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:43.840]   You can't say no bullying on YouTube,
[01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:45.200]   but that bullying's okay.
[01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:46.880]   - I feel like YouTube,
[01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:51.040]   so the real problem is, is YouTube a platform or a publisher?
[01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:54.480]   - Like everything else, it's stuck in between.
[01:37:54.480 --> 01:37:55.280]   - It's a little bit of both.
[01:37:55.280 --> 01:38:00.960]   And this is, of course, it was section 260 of the Internet Decency Act.
[01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:02.880]   This is the whole issue, isn't it?
[01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:04.720]   If you're a platform, you're not responsible.
[01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:06.320]   You can't be held responsible.
[01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:07.520]   You're like the phone company.
[01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:08.160]   You can't be right.
[01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:11.040]   Phone company's not responsible for the death threats you make on their phones.
[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:13.360]   You are.
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:16.640]   But if you're a publisher, like Fast Company,
[01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:19.040]   then you're responsible for every word that's written on your website.
[01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:20.880]   - The phone company does not curate phone calls.
[01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:21.280]   - They're not.
[01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:21.920]   They don't have to.
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:23.680]   If I make any one phone call,
[01:38:23.680 --> 01:38:26.400]   it's not looking for other phone calls I might want to make in the future.
[01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:28.000]   - There's stupid recommendation engine.
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.760]   I'm telling you that if you could just be a,
[01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:30.400]   that's the thing.
[01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:32.880]   If they could say reasonably, we're just a platform.
[01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:33.520]   - Yes.
[01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:34.880]   - We just put stuff up.
[01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:36.080]   Anything you want, we put it up.
[01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:37.760]   Facebook is the same thing.
[01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:40.000]   If they took the news feeds, it's the new thing.
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:40.320]   - It's the new thing.
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:41.280]   - Algory them out and made it a time-
[01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:41.440]   - See how crazy.
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:42.240]   - A serious thing,
[01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:43.840]   a stuff that you opted into.
[01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:44.080]   - Yes.
[01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:45.200]   - They wouldn't have responsibility for it,
[01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:47.040]   but they make editorial choices.
[01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:49.440]   - So, meaning you have a recommendation engine.
[01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:51.600]   In my opinion, you are a publisher.
[01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:54.400]   And now all of that stuff, they're trying to avoid,
[01:38:54.400 --> 01:38:56.240]   because they want to have it both ways.
[01:38:56.240 --> 01:39:00.400]   - You are a publisher who's not paying all of the content creators.
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:00.880]   - That's right.
[01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:02.000]   - Although YouTube, of course,
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:03.520]   does pay a lot of the content creators.
[01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:07.360]   - Well, that's another matter I've been harping on for years,
[01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:10.400]   which is, you know, when you're working on YouTube's farm,
[01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:13.520]   you're lucky if you get a penny on the dollar, you know.
[01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:16.720]   - But they're blaming the algorithm for all of this.
[01:39:16.720 --> 01:39:17.680]   - Right, so dump the algorithm.
[01:39:17.680 --> 01:39:19.840]   - Yeah, and then it was also a laugh.
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:21.120]   - But who wrote the algorithm?
[01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:24.480]   - Right, and it's a lack of fourth thought of what could happen.
[01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:27.600]   You know, well, why didn't these people assume like,
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:30.320]   "Okay, well, what would happen if people use this
[01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:35.120]   in the worst way possible, then this recommendation algorithm
[01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:37.840]   would lead people to be, you know,
[01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:41.200]   into this left wing or right wing releasing chickens
[01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:43.120]   or becoming a Nazi, whatever it is.
[01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:45.520]   Like, how could they not have imagined that?"
[01:39:45.520 --> 01:39:46.720]   - So, well, we didn't.
[01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:48.880]   I mean, to be fair, when Twitter started,
[01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:50.400]   I thought, "Oh, this is gonna be great.
[01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:52.000]   Everybody have a voice."
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:39:54.640]   Had no idea how horrible it would become.
[01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:57.920]   I mean, they got rid of info wars.
[01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:02.000]   They banned Alex Jones mostly because of pressure, I would guess.
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:03.200]   - Took a long time for them to do it.
[01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:04.240]   - And it took them a long time.
[01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:06.320]   - They're banning all neo-Nazis and white supremacists.
[01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:09.200]   - But louder with Crowder, they didn't ban, they demonetized.
[01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:12.320]   They demonetized, so he can't make money on it.
[01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:14.240]   But of course, all of these YouTube channels,
[01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:16.720]   I believe the bulk of the money they make,
[01:40:16.720 --> 01:40:18.160]   it doesn't come from YouTube advertising.
[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:19.520]   - You selling t-shirts and stuff?
[01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:20.320]   - Yeah.
[01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:21.440]   - Comes from merchandise.
[01:40:21.440 --> 01:40:22.800]   - If you wanna have--
[01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:23.360]   - Or whatever.
[01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:25.680]   - If you wanna have rules about what you can and cannot say
[01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:27.760]   on YouTube, like, bullying, which they have rules about,
[01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:28.640]   you need to enforce them.
[01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:29.840]   If you're not going to enforce them,
[01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:30.480]   don't have them.
[01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:31.840]   If you're gonna make editorial choices,
[01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:33.040]   you have editorial responses and villages.
[01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:34.080]   - If you're a publisher, be a publisher.
[01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:37.600]   - A side and stop with this crap of when to be in the middle.
[01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:39.120]   Or just tell me the truth.
[01:40:39.120 --> 01:40:41.760]   We want it both ways because we only care about money
[01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:43.280]   and then go after yourself.
[01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:44.800]   I'm editing myself gently here for the show.
[01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:48.640]   - Now, honestly, if you're completely cynical,
[01:40:48.640 --> 01:40:52.000]   isn't that the right point of view to take?
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:53.520]   Because you're never gonna really,
[01:40:53.520 --> 01:40:55.920]   maybe you'll pay, what do they pay in Europe?
[01:40:55.920 --> 01:40:59.440]   A five billion dollar fine and then you move on.
[01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:02.560]   I mean, really, isn't that a pragmatic approach?
[01:41:02.560 --> 01:41:03.600]   Is all right, come get us.
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:04.800]   The fines are just too low.
[01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:08.240]   It should hurt more than that.
[01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:09.920]   You shouldn't be able to pre-announce what happened was
[01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:12.000]   they pre-announced a fine in their earnings call
[01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.400]   of an expectation of what they will get charged.
[01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:16.800]   If you can do that, if I can pre-pay, my fine,
[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:17.680]   it's not a fine.
[01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:18.880]   It's not gonna tap on the wrist.
[01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:20.000]   It's just a cost of doing business.
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:21.120]   Put it in your cogs.
[01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:22.720]   - There is a point to be made though,
[01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:26.160]   that you don't want government to decide
[01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:28.800]   what's approved, what's not approved on YouTube.
[01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:31.280]   - I'm no interested in doing that.
[01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:35.280]   - Yeah, so you find them for not what they put on there.
[01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:36.320]   What do you find them?
[01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:39.280]   - I don't want to conflate the EU issue and the YouTube thing.
[01:41:39.280 --> 01:41:41.280]   - Right, the EU is a competitive competition issue.
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:42.400]   - Right, which is, I think.
[01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:45.600]   - So what could the US government do reasonably?
[01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:47.200]   I mean, as much.
[01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:52.560]   I mean, I think YouTube says, well, fine.
[01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:55.200]   So sue me.
[01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:56.640]   - So what you're saying is that they took away
[01:41:56.640 --> 01:42:00.320]   the recommendation engine YouTube would no longer make money,
[01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:02.160]   like they would no longer make money.
[01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:03.760]   - It would limit view time,
[01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:06.160]   because the recommendation engine exists and is promoted
[01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:07.600]   because it drives as Harry Potter out.
[01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:11.760]   - Same reason Netflix auto plays every goddamn part.
[01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:12.560]   - Gosh darn.
[01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:13.840]   - Gosh darn video.
[01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:16.080]   - Right, it increases the time you spend on the site.
[01:42:16.080 --> 01:42:18.240]   I mean, for example, if you read John Doar's book,
[01:42:18.240 --> 01:42:20.080]   Measure What Matters, which goes over OKRs,
[01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:21.280]   which is how Google runs its business.
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:23.120]   There's a story about YouTube in there
[01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:24.320]   and discusses how they were trying to get
[01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:27.600]   to the billion hours viewed per month mark or something like that.
[01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:30.240]   They are hungry for your attention in your time
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:31.680]   because that's how they can make more money.
[01:42:31.680 --> 01:42:34.560]   - In fact, it was the growth engine at Facebook
[01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:36.320]   that got them into the most trouble right away.
[01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:37.040]   - It was the growth team.
[01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:37.520]   - Growth team.
[01:42:37.520 --> 01:42:37.840]   - Yeah.
[01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:40.800]   These people are not out for our best interest,
[01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:41.760]   but they make a lot of money.
[01:42:41.760 --> 01:42:42.480]   And so this is what it works.
[01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:44.160]   So you say, how do we end up down this path?
[01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:46.160]   Well, because all the signals along the way
[01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:48.160]   had dollar signs attached to them.
[01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:49.440]   And I just think that they should stop
[01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:50.480]   trying to have it both ways.
[01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:51.760]   And they have enough money already,
[01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:52.480]   and they don't need more.
[01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:54.960]   You make enough profit as it is, just cap it.
[01:42:54.960 --> 01:42:56.480]   - Do you agree with Elizabeth Warren
[01:42:56.480 --> 01:42:58.160]   and others that we should break them on?
[01:42:58.160 --> 01:43:02.560]   - I think Elizabeth Warren is very, very smart,
[01:43:02.560 --> 01:43:04.960]   but I don't think there's any political will to do that in the country.
[01:43:04.960 --> 01:43:05.280]   - No.
[01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:06.800]   - It also takes a long time.
[01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:08.160]   It's not like it's something that could--
[01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:10.960]   - And I'm concerned about unintended consequences.
[01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:12.720]   - She has a real extreme take on it.
[01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:13.280]   - Yeah.
[01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:14.160]   - I think it's little too far.
[01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:17.040]   - But you could, I don't disagree with her
[01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:20.880]   that maybe Facebook should be forced to divest Instagram
[01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:21.920]   and WhatsApp.
[01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:25.280]   That Google, maybe Google should be forced to divest YouTube.
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:27.760]   I was never happy with Google owning YouTube.
[01:43:27.760 --> 01:43:30.240]   - Well, Facebook is quickly unifying the messaging back
[01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:33.120]   and between its applications to make them impossible to unstick.
[01:43:33.120 --> 01:43:33.600]   - Wow.
[01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:36.720]   - It's almost like Menlo Park has some intelligent people inside of it.
[01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:38.640]   But I mean, this is an Amazon issue.
[01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:39.280]   Sorry, Harry.
[01:43:39.280 --> 01:43:41.600]   - I was gonna say Facebook says that they would have,
[01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:44.960]   Instagram and WhatsApp or separate companies,
[01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:48.160]   they would have less resources to fight all the bad stuff.
[01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:48.960]   - Oh.
[01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:52.960]   - There's an economy of scale because they're part of this larger company.
[01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:53.280]   - Yeah.
[01:43:53.280 --> 01:43:54.160]   - Makes me so mad.
[01:43:54.160 --> 01:43:56.320]   If we can't be huge, China's gonna win.
[01:43:56.320 --> 01:43:56.800]   - By the way.
[01:43:56.800 --> 01:43:57.760]   - That's the argument that it is.
[01:43:57.760 --> 01:44:01.600]   - That is Google's excuse for saying we really need to be able to do business with Huawei.
[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:05.280]   Because if we got them loose, it's bad for everybody.
[01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:07.280]   - I'm skeptical about government being involved in.
[01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:10.880]   In fact, our current federal administration
[01:44:10.880 --> 01:44:14.000]   is talking about looking into the social platforms
[01:44:14.000 --> 01:44:15.520]   for being unfair to conservatives.
[01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:15.760]   - Right.
[01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:19.920]   - And it's almost the opposite of some of the concerns other people have.
[01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:21.360]   It's the weirdest complaint.
[01:44:21.360 --> 01:44:23.360]   Nothing is bigger on Facebook than
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:27.040]   people of Leo's age sharing Fox News content.
[01:44:27.040 --> 01:44:28.720]   It's like the biggest thing on Facebook.
[01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:29.920]   And I tried that very dumb.
[01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:32.800]   - I'm sorry, I try not to do it, but they're so compelling.
[01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:34.480]   And I just, I can't resist.
[01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:36.640]   - Those, those broccabama memes.
[01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:36.880]   - Yeah.
[01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:38.720]   - I mean, Facebook runs on Fox News.
[01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:40.560]   It's super popular stuff.
[01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:42.720]   - It's not bias against conservatives.
[01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:48.880]   - Well, do you think Leo, the government should step in and say no more recommendation
[01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:49.200]   engine?
[01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:52.080]   - Well, that would be an interesting thing you could do without
[01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:54.080]   breaking them up.
[01:44:54.080 --> 01:44:59.280]   There seems to be a middle ground between breaking them up and ignoring them.
[01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:02.080]   That maybe there are some things you could do.
[01:45:02.080 --> 01:45:03.760]   I think it's a challenge to figure out what those are,
[01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:06.240]   but I think with some energy and some effort,
[01:45:06.240 --> 01:45:11.600]   more intelligent people than I could probably figure out things like maybe,
[01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:13.600]   yeah, no more recommendation engine.
[01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:17.360]   - Doesn't it get to the point where it's like yelling fire in a crowded theater?
[01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:19.120]   I mean, that it isn't, you know, that it's-
[01:45:19.120 --> 01:45:21.040]   - Well, they're not protecting violence.
[01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:23.440]   - I mean, I'm saying like that it's protected by freezing-
[01:45:23.440 --> 01:45:24.080]   - Oh, I see what you were saying.
[01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:24.640]   It is dangerous.
[01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:27.520]   - Yeah, but this is the real issue.
[01:45:27.520 --> 01:45:28.640]   Who decides what's-
[01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:29.520]   - Right, exactly.
[01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:30.720]   - Who decides what's dangerous?
[01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:32.080]   Is it the chicken liberators?
[01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:34.000]   Are that dangerous?
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:36.560]   - Or it's the proponents of the poultry carceral state.
[01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:36.880]   - Yes.
[01:45:36.880 --> 01:45:38.400]   - I was holding that for as-
[01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:41.920]   - Because I have other issues with the recommendation engine,
[01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:43.200]   and that's just the amount of time.
[01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:44.240]   I mean, like I check my-
[01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:46.560]   - It's bad for humans and other living things.
[01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:47.440]   - Right, exactly.
[01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:47.920]   - In general.
[01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:50.720]   - Just, I mean, even if you're just constantly watching
[01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:53.040]   educational videos that are all accurate
[01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:54.160]   and they're from NASA or-
[01:45:54.160 --> 01:45:55.840]   - Even if it were good recommendations,
[01:45:55.840 --> 01:45:56.480]   it would be bad.
[01:45:56.480 --> 01:45:58.960]   - It's just like if you're going to be doing it for 12 hours,
[01:45:58.960 --> 01:46:00.160]   then it's not healthy.
[01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:03.840]   - Yeah, I mean, Netflix AutoPlay isn't inherently evil.
[01:46:03.840 --> 01:46:07.920]   It's not dragging me down into the depths of chicken carcinators.
[01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:11.840]   But, but it's annoying as hell.
[01:46:11.840 --> 01:46:14.720]   And it gets me to watch a hell of a lot more TV than I want to.
[01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:16.560]   What if the solution is what we just talked about earlier?
[01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:18.560]   The idea that you can be a publisher or a platform,
[01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:19.360]   but if you're going to have-
[01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:20.960]   - Pick one. - Pick one.
[01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:22.320]   - Plast-a-sure, not allowed.
[01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:24.640]   - The law exists to do this.
[01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:26.440]   To be honest, that's-
[01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:29.440]   We don't have to even write a new law to do that.
[01:46:29.440 --> 01:46:31.040]   - But just have to enforce it.
[01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:32.160]   - That's exactly the problem.
[01:46:32.160 --> 01:46:33.680]   Despite all of the things that we've said,
[01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:35.440]   which I think most of which are pretty true,
[01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:37.320]   who are we going to trust to go into these companies
[01:46:37.320 --> 01:46:39.880]   with enough intelligence to properly regulate them?
[01:46:39.880 --> 01:46:41.280]   We have a government currently,
[01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:44.240]   an administration has very pointed out, of Schmucks.
[01:46:44.240 --> 01:46:45.600]   I wouldn't trust them to change my tires.
[01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:46.720]   - I didn't use that word.
[01:46:46.720 --> 01:46:48.000]   - I was paraphrasing.
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:49.120]   But I'll call them Schmucks.
[01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:50.880]   - I don't think I've ever heard Harry say Schmuck.
[01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:52.400]   - He's that word.
[01:46:52.400 --> 01:46:53.680]   - Might have used even worse word,
[01:46:53.680 --> 01:46:55.040]   but I didn't use that particular word.
[01:46:55.040 --> 01:46:56.040]   - I forgot the exact quote,
[01:46:56.040 --> 01:46:57.640]   half of them I said, and had to land the plan.
[01:46:57.640 --> 01:46:59.640]   So like, it's filled in.
[01:46:59.640 --> 01:47:02.920]   - Yeah, honestly, we may be worried about a minor thing
[01:47:02.920 --> 01:47:05.120]   compared to what could happen in the next couple of years.
[01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:10.120]   So, for instance, there seems to be zero will in the Senate
[01:47:10.120 --> 01:47:14.480]   to do anything about Russian election interference.
[01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:18.080]   And that's already started.
[01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:22.280]   It's already started and no big deal.
[01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:23.600]   - Mitch McConnell's not worried.
[01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:24.440]   No big deal.
[01:47:24.440 --> 01:47:25.760]   - That's where dangerous water is going.
[01:47:25.760 --> 01:47:27.240]   - Yeah, I think we're in very dangerous water.
[01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:29.760]   So maybe worrying about whether Google should get rid
[01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:32.680]   of its recommendation engine is worrying about something
[01:47:32.680 --> 01:47:33.960]   not so important.
[01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:35.120]   - I think it's pretty important.
[01:47:35.120 --> 01:47:36.200]   If you read that New York Times,
[01:47:36.200 --> 01:47:37.280]   like Kevin Rose article,
[01:47:37.280 --> 01:47:40.720]   like if it is really a breeding ground for, you know,
[01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:41.920]   somebody to--
[01:47:41.920 --> 01:47:43.240]   - Flat Earthers.
[01:47:43.240 --> 01:47:45.360]   Seriously.
[01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:46.360]   - Anti-vaxxers.
[01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:47.560]   - Yeah.
[01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:50.200]   I like using Flat Earthers 'cause it's apolitical.
[01:47:50.200 --> 01:47:51.800]   But it's a really good example.
[01:47:51.800 --> 01:47:54.920]   On the face of it,
[01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:57.240]   believing the Earth is flat is nuts.
[01:47:57.240 --> 01:48:01.200]   And it really had pretty much died out until YouTube.
[01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:05.240]   And suddenly people believe the Earth is flat again
[01:48:05.240 --> 01:48:07.000]   because of YouTube.
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:10.400]   Magellan figured it out by looking at the horizon.
[01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:11.800]   So go outside,
[01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:15.200]   although I got a very snitty email.
[01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:16.680]   Did you see that?
[01:48:16.680 --> 01:48:18.120]   'Cause I had said,
[01:48:18.120 --> 01:48:19.920]   I was talking on Twig about this and I said,
[01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:21.240]   "Well, you know, you get in an airplane,
[01:48:21.240 --> 01:48:23.040]   "you can see the curvature of the Earth."
[01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:24.920]   Excuse me, Leo, but Neil deGrasse Tyson
[01:48:24.920 --> 01:48:26.920]   has pointed out that in a commercial flight
[01:48:26.920 --> 01:48:28.120]   of 36,000 feet,
[01:48:28.120 --> 01:48:29.400]   or less, you came out in fact,
[01:48:29.400 --> 01:48:30.760]   "You're the curvature of the Earth."
[01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:32.760]   So I apologize.
[01:48:32.760 --> 01:48:34.360]   It looked curved to me.
[01:48:34.360 --> 01:48:38.440]   - I don't know if that was really an apology.
[01:48:38.440 --> 01:48:39.720]   (laughing)
[01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:40.560]   - No.
[01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:44.960]   Excuse me, but I believe you're wrong.
[01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:46.560]   - And anyway,
[01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:51.600]   it's the horizon, not the curve-isen,
[01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:53.720]   says Eric Deckman, Eric Sharp.
[01:48:53.720 --> 01:48:54.800]   Was that your email, Eric?
[01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:55.640]   I apologize.
[01:48:55.640 --> 01:48:58.520]   - For mocking you repeatedly on the show.
[01:48:58.520 --> 01:49:00.760]   - Am I wrong, but does it not go curved when you're up there?
[01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:02.480]   - I thought it did, but I might be wrong.
[01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:04.560]   Maybe it's the window, it's a distortion.
[01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:05.640]   Could be, I don't know.
[01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:07.720]   - Anyways, the world round.
[01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:08.640]   - Is the world round?
[01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:10.200]   - Well, I think we're pretty sure it is.
[01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:12.480]   Unless you believe that every astronaut,
[01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:14.560]   every satellite, every picture you've seen
[01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:17.640]   of the big moon marble is fake.
[01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:18.640]   But that's the problem,
[01:49:18.640 --> 01:49:20.280]   is that if you watch enough YouTube videos,
[01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:22.000]   you can believe anything is fake.
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.800]   - It's actually a bumpy spheroid.
[01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:27.920]   - I think it's an ovoid, isn't it?
[01:49:27.920 --> 01:49:29.280]   I don't know, it's got a name for it,
[01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:30.560]   whatever shape it is.
[01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:31.440]   - Yes, but it's not flat.
[01:49:31.440 --> 01:49:32.280]   - It's not flat.
[01:49:32.280 --> 01:49:33.120]   - It's not a disc.
[01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:33.960]   - No, we're pretty sure it's not flat.
[01:49:33.960 --> 01:49:34.800]   It's bulged.
[01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:35.640]   - It's not held up by elephants.
[01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:36.960]   - Bulged, it's ovoid.
[01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:37.800]   - Okay.
[01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:39.480]   - It's an oblate spheroid, as a matter of fact.
[01:49:39.480 --> 01:49:40.320]   - Oblate spheroid.
[01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:41.160]   - I believe so.
[01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:42.000]   - That's the whole dollar with the word.
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:42.840]   - That's what Grey Raven says,
[01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:45.080]   and I'm going with Grey Raven.
[01:49:45.080 --> 01:49:45.920]   It does sound right.
[01:49:45.920 --> 01:49:47.880]   That rings a bell, oblate spheroid.
[01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:50.760]   Plus it's fun to say.
[01:49:50.760 --> 01:49:53.560]   Somehow this guy has his record
[01:49:53.560 --> 01:49:55.880]   of the number of political videos he watched.
[01:49:55.880 --> 01:49:57.040]   - You can download it if you do.
[01:49:57.040 --> 01:49:57.880]   - We all about it.
[01:49:57.880 --> 01:49:59.600]   - We'll download your YouTube history.
[01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:00.680]   - How does he know that?
[01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:03.640]   What magic is, what witchcraft is this?
[01:50:03.640 --> 01:50:05.880]   - I mean, I'm just gonna put on my mom hat for a second,
[01:50:05.880 --> 01:50:08.920]   but everyone, every parent who's worried about their kid
[01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:11.120]   watching porn, that's not what you should be wearing.
[01:50:11.120 --> 01:50:11.960]   - No.
[01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:12.800]   - Really?
[01:50:12.800 --> 01:50:13.640]   - There's other kinds of pornography.
[01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:16.080]   - It's much bigger and taught.
[01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:18.080]   'Cause I think it's like kids alone,
[01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:21.560]   young teenagers, 20 year olds,
[01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:24.520]   alone watching this stuff with no one to talk to about it.
[01:50:24.520 --> 01:50:26.760]   And I think it's really serious.
[01:50:26.760 --> 01:50:27.880]   So look at your kids' YouTube.
[01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:30.360]   - Good job on Kevin Russe, and it'd be a worth reading.
[01:50:30.360 --> 01:50:32.480]   Actually go on the web, 'cause the web,
[01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:33.800]   they've done as usual with the times
[01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:35.600]   that have been a good job of production of this.
[01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:37.560]   - Also Kevin Russe in general is a fantastic journalist.
[01:50:37.560 --> 01:50:38.400]   - Great report.
[01:50:38.400 --> 01:50:39.240]   - He's really good.
[01:50:39.240 --> 01:50:40.080]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:50:40.080 --> 01:50:40.920]   - Yeah, big shut up.
[01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:43.760]   One of those long pieces he's probably spent months working on.
[01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:45.760]   - Yeah, he goes deep.
[01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:48.000]   And I always learn something reading his stuff.
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:54.080]   - He quotes Guillaume Chaslow, a former YouTube engineer
[01:50:54.080 --> 01:50:58.120]   who sits become a critic of the company's recommendation system.
[01:50:58.120 --> 01:51:00.360]   He said this year, "The YouTube's algorithms are designed
[01:51:00.360 --> 01:51:02.040]   to increase the time people spend online
[01:51:02.040 --> 01:51:04.120]   because it leads to more ads."
[01:51:04.120 --> 01:51:06.560]   It's that simple.
[01:51:06.560 --> 01:51:10.360]   But we also know it leads to other things.
[01:51:10.360 --> 01:51:13.520]   And it seems frankly the height of the responsibility
[01:51:13.520 --> 01:51:16.320]   for Google say, "We can fix this.
[01:51:16.320 --> 01:51:17.280]   We need those ads.
[01:51:17.280 --> 01:51:18.440]   We can fix this."
[01:51:18.440 --> 01:51:19.680]   - And it's not just far right either.
[01:51:19.680 --> 01:51:20.760]   There's far left.
[01:51:20.760 --> 01:51:21.760]   There's all kind of-- - Oh, like I said,
[01:51:21.760 --> 01:51:23.000]   chicken liberation front.
[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:25.480]   I mean-- - It's just untrue.
[01:51:25.480 --> 01:51:26.320]   - The CLF.
[01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:27.240]   - The CLF.
[01:51:27.240 --> 01:51:28.440]   - It's coming for your free range eggs.
[01:51:28.440 --> 01:51:30.000]   - Well, I'm a part of that, but--
[01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:30.840]   (laughs)
[01:51:30.840 --> 01:51:32.000]   - How happy are you, Rang?
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:33.560]   - Oh, I just don't eat chicken.
[01:51:33.560 --> 01:51:34.720]   - Oh, you don't have to eat them.
[01:51:34.720 --> 01:51:36.160]   They're just laying eggs, eat eggs?
[01:51:36.160 --> 01:51:37.000]   - Yeah, I do.
[01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:38.680]   - Did you see a chicken liberation person
[01:51:38.680 --> 01:51:41.240]   rush the stage when Jeff Bezos was speaking
[01:51:41.240 --> 01:51:43.040]   at the Amazon conference a few days ago?
[01:51:43.040 --> 01:51:43.920]   - No, I missed that.
[01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:46.080]   What were they hoping for?
[01:51:46.080 --> 01:51:46.920]   - I'm not sure.
[01:51:46.920 --> 01:51:47.760]   And I'm not sure where they--
[01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:48.640]   - Is Amazon sell chickens?
[01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:50.200]   - Well, they own whole foods, so--
[01:51:50.200 --> 01:51:51.600]   - Oh, of course they do, yeah.
[01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:53.600]   - I mean, to be clear, we could treat poultry
[01:51:53.600 --> 01:51:55.320]   a lot better in the American farming--
[01:51:55.320 --> 01:51:56.280]   - I completely agree.
[01:51:56.280 --> 01:51:58.560]   - Also, I used to collect eggs from chickens
[01:51:58.560 --> 01:52:01.040]   and a coop, and chickens are real dumb.
[01:52:01.040 --> 01:52:02.280]   - Nasty beasts.
[01:52:02.280 --> 01:52:03.400]   - They're not great.
[01:52:03.400 --> 01:52:05.240]   So there's a middle ground to be found here.
[01:52:05.240 --> 01:52:06.080]   - They deserve to be--
[01:52:06.080 --> 01:52:08.080]   - Yes, but treated nicely before I eat them.
[01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:08.920]   - Yeah.
[01:52:08.920 --> 01:52:10.480]   - If I was in 4-H, I know cows.
[01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:12.280]   Cows are dumb, no guilt,
[01:52:12.280 --> 01:52:14.120]   but they should be treated fairly well their own life.
[01:52:14.120 --> 01:52:16.520]   - We get our eggs from our neighbor.
[01:52:16.520 --> 01:52:20.040]   The chickens are wandering around, they're enjoying life,
[01:52:20.040 --> 01:52:23.000]   they're having sexual intercourse constantly, it's okay.
[01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:26.920]   - Details little, you always bring the details.
[01:52:26.920 --> 01:52:28.360]   - You should get back into the writing game.
[01:52:28.360 --> 01:52:30.120]   - Did you see--
[01:52:30.120 --> 01:52:31.400]   - All right, I'm gonna take a break.
[01:52:31.400 --> 01:52:32.720]   (laughing)
[01:52:32.720 --> 01:52:34.800]   Some are embarrassed now, flushing.
[01:52:34.800 --> 01:52:37.240]   And then I'm gonna talk about the big move Amazon made
[01:52:37.240 --> 01:52:39.520]   on Friday that's going to change everything.
[01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:41.480]   And it has nothing to do with chickens.
[01:52:41.480 --> 01:52:43.480]   Or sexual intercourse.
[01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:45.320]   Our show--
[01:52:45.320 --> 01:52:50.160]   Or she, they can edit that out, right?
[01:52:50.160 --> 01:52:51.000]   Our show today.
[01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.240]   - Right before the ad too.
[01:52:53.240 --> 01:52:54.760]   - Before the ad.
[01:52:54.760 --> 01:52:58.700]   Let's just pause for a moment to cleanse our thoughts,
[01:52:58.700 --> 01:53:01.480]   forget what Leo just said.
[01:53:04.640 --> 01:53:07.760]   - I wish we had a Twit recommendation engine.
[01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:09.800]   That we just recommend that we should do that,
[01:53:09.800 --> 01:53:10.800]   the next Twit.
[01:53:10.800 --> 01:53:12.000]   - We should get that nice picture.
[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:13.320]   - Lisa tweeted it.
[01:53:13.320 --> 01:53:15.960]   - Who's the most controversial guest that comes on the show?
[01:53:15.960 --> 01:53:17.320]   That would be the equivalent.
[01:53:17.320 --> 01:53:18.160]   - It's not me.
[01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:21.720]   - The equivalent of a--
[01:53:21.720 --> 01:53:22.800]   - Far right, chicken liberation--
[01:53:22.800 --> 01:53:24.720]   - A show broken chicken liberation type.
[01:53:24.720 --> 01:53:25.560]   - It's me.
[01:53:25.560 --> 01:53:26.400]   - It's you?
[01:53:26.400 --> 01:53:27.240]   - No, you're like the most--
[01:53:27.240 --> 01:53:28.080]   - Oh my God.
[01:53:28.080 --> 01:53:30.600]   - You're a nice educated person on the entire Twit.
[01:53:30.600 --> 01:53:33.120]   - You have no idea, you should watch iOS today.
[01:53:33.120 --> 01:53:34.840]   Probably Jason Calganis.
[01:53:34.840 --> 01:53:36.280]   - Yeah, he's pretty controversial.
[01:53:36.280 --> 01:53:38.640]   We love Jason though, I'm always trying to get him on.
[01:53:38.640 --> 01:53:40.640]   He's too busy these days.
[01:53:40.640 --> 01:53:43.080]   Dvorak has his moments.
[01:53:43.080 --> 01:53:44.440]   - I don't know if I've ever been on Dvorak,
[01:53:44.440 --> 01:53:45.920]   but I used to watch cranky geeks
[01:53:45.920 --> 01:53:47.120]   back in the ignition days.
[01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:48.920]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:53:48.920 --> 01:53:50.080]   He hasn't been on since Christmas.
[01:53:50.080 --> 01:53:53.360]   We keep trying to entice him, but yeah, no luck.
[01:53:53.360 --> 01:53:57.640]   - "Protester interrupts Jeff Bezos
[01:53:57.640 --> 01:54:00.800]   to plea for abused chickens."
[01:54:01.880 --> 01:54:02.880]   Here's the story.
[01:54:02.880 --> 01:54:07.240]   This'll be a little, we'll call this the palette cleanser,
[01:54:07.240 --> 01:54:08.920]   a little Amoose bush.
[01:54:08.920 --> 01:54:12.040]   Here's--
[01:54:12.040 --> 01:54:14.120]   - The colleague Mark Sullivan was in the room for that.
[01:54:14.120 --> 01:54:16.520]   - Here's Jeff being interrupted.
[01:54:16.520 --> 01:54:18.280]   Go ahead, you can turn on my idea.
[01:54:18.280 --> 01:54:20.560]   - If you want to be an entrepreneur,
[01:54:20.560 --> 01:54:24.680]   the most important thing is to be customer obsessed.
[01:54:24.680 --> 01:54:27.400]   So don't satisfy your customers.
[01:54:27.400 --> 01:54:30.280]   Figure out how to absolutely delight them.
[01:54:30.280 --> 01:54:31.600]   That is the number one thing.
[01:54:31.600 --> 01:54:33.960]   - We've been saving it for a long time.
[01:54:33.960 --> 01:54:36.000]   - Passion, you have got to have--
[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:39.080]   - Don't pay the warehouse workers more than 10 bucks an hour.
[01:54:39.080 --> 01:54:42.240]   - That you're going to develop and work in.
[01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:44.840]   - Jeff Bezos, he really underlined.
[01:54:44.840 --> 01:54:47.080]   - Wait a minute, where's the abused chicken?
[01:54:47.080 --> 01:54:50.240]   Now I feel like the Washington Examiner
[01:54:50.240 --> 01:54:51.800]   clicked, link baited me here.
[01:54:51.800 --> 01:54:53.240]   - Well, the Washington Examiner's not the paragon
[01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:54.400]   of journalistic integrity.
[01:54:54.400 --> 01:54:59.400]   - Where's the guy, Priya Sarni of direct action everywhere
[01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:03.880]   walked on stage to plead?
[01:55:03.880 --> 01:55:04.960]   Oh, here he is, with the Amazon--
[01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:06.760]   - Oh, I thought it was the chicken that walked on stage.
[01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:10.800]   - No, CEO about the welfare of chickens in factory farms.
[01:55:10.800 --> 01:55:12.280]   The guy walks on, what are you funny
[01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:13.760]   if you were wearing a chicken suit?
[01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:16.360]   Here you go, here's the, play my audio again.
[01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:18.360]   - Work can actually move the needle.
[01:55:18.360 --> 01:55:24.560]   - I've been inside of Amazon's chicken farms
[01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:26.600]   where animals are criminally abused.
[01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:30.480]   And now she's being dragged off
[01:55:30.480 --> 01:55:32.080]   and then Jeff's just sitting there.
[01:55:32.080 --> 01:55:34.160]   - I didn't know Amazon had chicken farms.
[01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:36.080]   Whole Foods.
[01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:37.800]   - This is Amazon Fresh, there's Whole Foods.
[01:55:37.800 --> 01:55:38.640]   Oh yeah.
[01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:40.600]   - There's Amazon Ghost Stories with chicken sandwiches.
[01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:42.640]   - I mean, Amazon now even sells like,
[01:55:42.640 --> 01:55:44.400]   Amazon basics men's shorts.
[01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:45.760]   Like I'm not pretty sure they sell everything now.
[01:55:45.760 --> 01:55:48.080]   - You do not want to be the richest man in the world
[01:55:48.080 --> 01:55:50.560]   because what happens is people come to you and say,
[01:55:50.560 --> 01:55:52.520]   "You could fix this, everything."
[01:55:52.520 --> 01:55:55.080]   - I'm not so sure where their Amazon owns
[01:55:55.080 --> 01:55:56.080]   chicken farms though.
[01:55:56.080 --> 01:55:56.920]   - Right.
[01:55:56.920 --> 01:55:58.080]   - If I was the richest man in the world,
[01:55:58.080 --> 01:55:59.520]   no one would ever talk to me.
[01:55:59.520 --> 01:56:01.280]   I would never let them give it an island.
[01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:02.120]   - Yes exactly.
[01:56:02.120 --> 01:56:04.200]   I would live on the island, I'd fly my friends in,
[01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:06.720]   I would live in a hot tub, I'd never get out.
[01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:09.040]   And it would be the best life of all time.
[01:56:09.040 --> 01:56:10.520]   - A little wrinkly.
[01:56:10.520 --> 01:56:13.160]   - I think, you know what Priya, I'm glad you did that.
[01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:14.840]   It's good, let's raise the issue,
[01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:17.120]   let's talk about the plight of chickens.
[01:56:17.120 --> 01:56:20.200]   - One thing you don't want to do is go to the post office.
[01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:21.080]   Not that they're not wondering,
[01:56:21.080 --> 01:56:23.080]   I like the post office, I like to hang out there
[01:56:23.080 --> 01:56:24.800]   and talk to my postal carrier.
[01:56:24.800 --> 01:56:27.320]   But if you're trying to mail something,
[01:56:27.320 --> 01:56:28.440]   if you're trying to get postage,
[01:56:28.440 --> 01:56:30.920]   the best way to do it, stay right at your desk,
[01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:34.320]   sit at your desk and use stamps.com.
[01:56:34.320 --> 01:56:36.520]   No more driving to the post office,
[01:56:36.520 --> 01:56:38.480]   parking, lugging your mail in packages in.
[01:56:38.480 --> 01:56:40.960]   No, you can do everything you do at the post office
[01:56:40.960 --> 01:56:43.760]   right here at your desk with stamps.com.
[01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:45.360]   One of the most popular time saving tools

[01:56:47.080 --> 01:56:49.200]   we've been using it for years.
[01:56:49.200 --> 01:56:51.360]   Stamps.com eliminates trips to the post office,
[01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:53.800]   saves you money, you get deals from stamps,
[01:56:53.800 --> 01:56:55.960]   you can't get at the post office.
[01:56:55.960 --> 01:56:58.200]   And everything, you can print postage,
[01:56:58.200 --> 01:57:00.600]   you get a lovely USB scale,
[01:57:00.600 --> 01:57:02.520]   so you always have exactly the right postage.
[01:57:02.520 --> 01:57:05.480]   Stamps will even suggest the right postage
[01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:06.320]   to save you money.
[01:57:06.320 --> 01:57:08.040]   They'll say, you know, this is a book, Media Mail,
[01:57:08.040 --> 01:57:09.320]   you could save some money.
[01:57:09.320 --> 01:57:12.480]   If you are an Amazon or eBay or Etsy seller,
[01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:14.800]   you can make your mailing look so much more professional,
[01:57:14.800 --> 01:57:16.680]   you can print right on envelopes with your logo,
[01:57:16.680 --> 01:57:18.120]   you return a dress automatically.
[01:57:18.120 --> 01:57:19.600]   If you're mailing a package,
[01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:22.160]   you don't have to lick and paste a bunch of stamps on,
[01:57:22.160 --> 01:57:23.440]   maybe put a few extra on
[01:57:23.440 --> 01:57:25.000]   because you don't want it to be postage.
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:26.000]   You don't know, it'll do it all
[01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.160]   and it looks professional, looks beautiful.
[01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:30.120]   Whether you're a small office setting,
[01:57:30.120 --> 01:57:33.080]   invoices and online shipper selling products
[01:57:33.080 --> 01:57:35.840]   or even a warehouse setting thousands of packages a day,
[01:57:35.840 --> 01:57:38.320]   Stamps.com can handle it all.
[01:57:38.320 --> 01:57:39.800]   Simply use your computer,
[01:57:39.800 --> 01:57:42.400]   your printer, no special hardware to print
[01:57:42.400 --> 01:57:45.800]   official US postage 24/7.
[01:57:45.800 --> 01:57:48.440]   And once your mail's ready, you just hand it to the carrier,
[01:57:48.440 --> 01:57:51.440]   drop it in a mailbox, that's it, it's done.
[01:57:51.440 --> 01:57:52.640]   With Stamps.com, get this,
[01:57:52.640 --> 01:57:55.000]   you get five cents off every first class stamp

[01:57:57.800 --> 01:58:01.440]   Just the other day, when they raise the rates,
[01:58:01.440 --> 01:58:04.080]   I said, oh no, I have a bunch of stamps
[01:58:04.080 --> 01:58:05.920]   that I can't use anymore.
[01:58:05.920 --> 01:58:06.800]   I went in the office,
[01:58:06.800 --> 01:58:07.680]   we printed out the little,
[01:58:07.680 --> 01:58:10.120]   whatever two cents stamps I needed, Stamps.com.
[01:58:10.120 --> 01:58:13.040]   It's a no brainer, saves you time, saves you money.
[01:58:13.040 --> 01:58:16.920]   It's no wonder 700,000 small businesses already use Stamps.com.

[01:58:27.800 --> 01:58:29.560]   See that nice lady, she's trying to give you the offer,
[01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:31.000]   no, no, no, no, no, no, don't click her,

[01:58:38.440 --> 01:58:41.680]   who was gonna give you an amazing deal.
[01:58:41.680 --> 01:58:43.080]   Stamps.com,
[01:58:43.080 --> 01:58:48.440]   and the offer code twit to get that credible offer.
[01:58:48.440 --> 01:58:52.000]   Stamps.com, thank you Stamps, by the way.
[01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.320]   They've been a sponsor of this show for more than a decade,
[01:58:54.320 --> 01:58:55.200]   I think. - Really?
[01:58:55.200 --> 01:58:56.440]   - Yeah. - That's impressive.
[01:58:56.440 --> 01:58:58.600]   - Yeah, I really am very grateful to them.
[01:58:58.600 --> 01:59:03.120]   So on Friday, Amazon said,
[01:59:03.120 --> 01:59:05.880]   "Actually it was Americans, I mean, a federal express said,
[01:59:05.880 --> 01:59:08.640]   "We're not doing business with Amazon anymore."
[01:59:08.640 --> 01:59:10.240]   That's it, it's over.
[01:59:10.240 --> 01:59:13.080]   Battle lines are being drawn now.
[01:59:13.080 --> 01:59:16.480]   I read the Brad Stone's great book, The Everything Store.
[01:59:16.480 --> 01:59:18.280]   And he talked about the battle Amazon fought
[01:59:18.280 --> 01:59:21.480]   with the carriers, UPS and FedEx to keep the prices low.
[01:59:21.480 --> 01:59:23.440]   And Amazon has a lot of clout, they say,
[01:59:23.440 --> 01:59:24.760]   "We won't do business."
[01:59:24.760 --> 01:59:27.080]   But all this time with his deal in place,
[01:59:27.080 --> 01:59:29.440]   they've been buying or leasing jets,
[01:59:29.440 --> 01:59:31.960]   they've been building facilities.
[01:59:31.960 --> 01:59:34.880]   In fact, maybe it's just Petaluma,
[01:59:34.880 --> 01:59:37.200]   but when you get packages delivered to you,
[01:59:37.200 --> 01:59:40.600]   is it from an Amazon Prime truck or a FedEx truck?
[01:59:40.600 --> 01:59:41.760]   - Much of the time it's Amazon.
[01:59:41.760 --> 01:59:43.080]   - Yeah. - The foot-financed
[01:59:43.080 --> 01:59:44.800]   my old list. - Yeah.
[01:59:44.800 --> 01:59:47.280]   More and more, Amazon's doing their own deliveries,
[01:59:47.280 --> 01:59:49.680]   even drone deliveries.
[01:59:49.680 --> 01:59:51.560]   So FedEx, I think finally said,
[01:59:51.560 --> 01:59:53.440]   "You know what, we're gonna side with the other guys,
[01:59:53.440 --> 01:59:55.400]   "we're gonna go, we're getting plenty of business
[01:59:55.400 --> 01:59:59.600]   "from Walmart and that's the future."
[01:59:59.600 --> 02:00:01.040]   So I think it's gonna be interesting to watch
[02:00:01.040 --> 02:00:03.080]   the Battle of the Mahimists here over.
[02:00:03.080 --> 02:00:05.440]   - I thought they were stopping the air contracts,
[02:00:05.440 --> 02:00:08.040]   but not the last mile deliveries.
[02:00:08.040 --> 02:00:10.080]   - Maybe I misread it, I thought they said
[02:00:10.080 --> 02:00:11.400]   no more business with Amazon.
[02:00:11.400 --> 02:00:13.880]   - No, I think your thing makes more sense than mine.
[02:00:13.880 --> 02:00:16.440]   But I don't think the entire relationship is kaput,
[02:00:16.440 --> 02:00:18.400]   I think they're getting rid of a chunk of it,
[02:00:18.400 --> 02:00:21.960]   which is still very important and key to how they operate.
[02:00:21.960 --> 02:00:23.960]   - And it could be-- - For express deliveries.
[02:00:23.960 --> 02:00:24.800]   - For express deliveries.
[02:00:24.800 --> 02:00:26.340]   - They're still doing international stuff?
[02:00:26.340 --> 02:00:27.580]   - International, okay.
[02:00:27.580 --> 02:00:31.440]   I mean, it could also be another one of those
[02:00:31.440 --> 02:00:33.780]   negotiation things where they'll come back and say,
[02:00:33.780 --> 02:00:34.840]   okay, we made a deal.
[02:00:34.840 --> 02:00:38.000]   Amazon obviously has plenty of deliveries to go around.
[02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:41.160]   Here's their new drone.
[02:00:41.160 --> 02:00:43.080]   It's the primary delivery drone.
[02:00:43.080 --> 02:00:45.360]   It can fly vertically like a helicopter.
[02:00:45.360 --> 02:00:48.600]   I don't, I thought all drones could.
[02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:51.360]   And in a new aerodynamic airplane mode,
[02:00:52.120 --> 02:00:54.120]   there it goes.
[02:00:54.120 --> 02:00:59.040]   This is, so you don't, you don't think this is this VTOL device.
[02:00:59.040 --> 02:01:01.160]   - We all fell for this like four years ago.
[02:01:01.160 --> 02:01:02.360]   - Yeah, 60 minutes, remember?
[02:01:02.360 --> 02:01:03.200]   - Yeah.
[02:01:03.200 --> 02:01:04.200]   - And they're like, this is coming out now.
[02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:05.240]   It's already gonna be in the market.
[02:01:05.240 --> 02:01:06.440]   I've never seen one.
[02:01:06.440 --> 02:01:08.120]   And now they're gonna get another press cycle
[02:01:08.120 --> 02:01:09.480]   because people have forgotten what they had
[02:01:09.480 --> 02:01:10.560]   for lunch last week.
[02:01:10.560 --> 02:01:11.920]   And we're gonna go through all over again.
[02:01:11.920 --> 02:01:13.520]   And I'm still not gonna see one in the air.
[02:01:13.520 --> 02:01:15.960]   There's regulatory problems, there's pathing problems.
[02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:18.520]   - Do you really want drones all over the place?
[02:01:18.520 --> 02:01:20.920]   - Eventually, pretty soon you're gonna look up
[02:01:20.920 --> 02:01:22.600]   and all you're gonna see is Elon Musk's
[02:01:22.600 --> 02:01:24.440]   Starlink satellites and drones.
[02:01:24.440 --> 02:01:25.800]   And you won't see the sun.
[02:01:25.800 --> 02:01:28.280]   - But every 19 year old boy will be very happy by that.
[02:01:28.280 --> 02:01:30.160]   That's their current dream for the future.
[02:01:30.160 --> 02:01:32.800]   From the new drone uses a combination
[02:01:32.800 --> 02:01:34.800]   of thermal cameras, depth cameras, and sonar
[02:01:34.800 --> 02:01:36.560]   to detect hazards.
[02:01:36.560 --> 02:01:38.440]   With the help of machine learning models on board,
[02:01:38.440 --> 02:01:40.240]   computers can automatically identify obstacles
[02:01:40.240 --> 02:01:41.640]   and navigate around them.
[02:01:41.640 --> 02:01:44.400]   Here's the quote from Amazon's Jeff Wilkie.
[02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:46.960]   "From paragliders, power lines to the corgi
[02:01:46.960 --> 02:01:50.560]   in your backyard, this drone has you safely covered."
[02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:52.720]   (laughing)
[02:01:52.720 --> 02:01:55.160]   - I'm clear if they're delivering the corgi
[02:01:55.160 --> 02:01:56.600]   or avoiding the corgi.
[02:01:56.600 --> 02:01:58.260]   I don't, I'm not sure.
[02:01:58.260 --> 02:02:00.920]   I wanna see it.
[02:02:00.920 --> 02:02:04.480]   I wanna see one in the world commercial delivery.
[02:02:04.480 --> 02:02:05.320]   - So one of these.
[02:02:05.320 --> 02:02:06.280]   - This is a little misleading.
[02:02:06.280 --> 02:02:08.240]   If you watched the video I just showed,
[02:02:08.240 --> 02:02:10.680]   how big do you think that is?
[02:02:10.680 --> 02:02:12.800]   - It's hard to tell.
[02:02:12.800 --> 02:02:14.160]   - Let me show you how big it is.
[02:02:14.160 --> 02:02:16.480]   Here it is standing next to Jeff Wilkie.
[02:02:16.480 --> 02:02:18.720]   It's the size of a robo-cop.
[02:02:18.720 --> 02:02:20.720]   - So it's carrying the package inside that little-
[02:02:20.720 --> 02:02:22.520]   - It's gigantic.
[02:02:22.520 --> 02:02:24.000]   What if Jeff Wilkie's very small?
[02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:25.680]   - Yeah. - Oh, he could be tiny.
[02:02:25.680 --> 02:02:27.720]   Maybe it's a Jeff Wilkie action figure.
[02:02:27.720 --> 02:02:28.560]   - True.
[02:02:28.560 --> 02:02:30.760]   - It could actually be only six inches across.
[02:02:30.760 --> 02:02:32.560]   I don't think we want a lot of these flying
[02:02:32.560 --> 02:02:34.240]   through the air all of a sudden.
[02:02:34.240 --> 02:02:36.160]   - But if they're too small, they can't carry a match
[02:02:36.160 --> 02:02:38.680]   and it seems like the economies of scale would not work.
[02:02:38.680 --> 02:02:40.200]   - I guess they have to be bigger.
[02:02:40.200 --> 02:02:42.240]   But this looks like it's a one package delivery.
[02:02:42.240 --> 02:02:44.040]   Do you think they get multiple packages?
[02:02:44.040 --> 02:02:44.880]   What do they do?
[02:02:44.880 --> 02:02:47.560]   They hover over your house and open the mall and it falls.
[02:02:47.560 --> 02:02:48.600]   Under your corgi.
[02:02:48.600 --> 02:02:51.480]   (laughing)
[02:02:51.480 --> 02:02:53.920]   - I hope inside there there's like a package of cotton balls
[02:02:53.920 --> 02:02:55.080]   wrapped in a bunch of plastic.
[02:02:55.080 --> 02:02:57.000]   - There's only a few things they can deliver.
[02:02:57.000 --> 02:02:58.280]   That's for sure.
[02:02:58.280 --> 02:02:59.800]   Do you think we're gonna have like neighborhood
[02:02:59.800 --> 02:03:02.000]   like Amazon drop off points in the future?
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:03.640]   Like honey, we're not gonna have that.
[02:03:03.640 --> 02:03:05.600]   - They have the whole foods.
[02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:07.280]   - You perhaps have not heard of-
[02:03:07.280 --> 02:03:08.520]   - They work with apartment buildings.
[02:03:08.520 --> 02:03:10.840]   - Amazon's scout.
[02:03:10.840 --> 02:03:11.840]   - That's the little robot there.
[02:03:11.840 --> 02:03:12.680]   - That's the little robot.
[02:03:12.680 --> 02:03:14.240]   - But Jeff he has been tested, I believe.
[02:03:14.240 --> 02:03:15.080]   - Oh yeah.
[02:03:15.080 --> 02:03:15.920]   - He's out there doing deliveries.
[02:03:15.920 --> 02:03:16.760]   - It's no homage.
[02:03:16.760 --> 02:03:19.640]   - It's a, it's no homage, exactly.
[02:03:19.640 --> 02:03:20.880]   - I'm glad you said that.
[02:03:20.880 --> 02:03:21.720]   (laughing)
[02:03:21.720 --> 02:03:23.200]   - It's a homage on his midnight.
[02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:24.600]   This is a scout.
[02:03:24.600 --> 02:03:26.480]   It's a little, well, what is it?
[02:03:26.480 --> 02:03:29.800]   It's an igloo cooler on wheels is what it is.
[02:03:29.800 --> 02:03:31.400]   And it doesn't move very fast.
[02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:34.520]   It moves fairly slowly, but it does occupy the sidewalk.
[02:03:34.520 --> 02:03:37.640]   Fortunately, in most towns in America USA,
[02:03:37.640 --> 02:03:40.760]   nobody's on the sidewalk, so it's okay.
[02:03:40.760 --> 02:03:43.640]   Although having to dodge around this little robot
[02:03:43.640 --> 02:03:45.160]   all the time would be a little annoying.
[02:03:45.160 --> 02:03:46.800]   It's cute though, so I don't wanna kick it.
[02:03:46.800 --> 02:03:48.320]   - Yeah, but people will.
[02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:49.280]   - Well, maybe.
[02:03:49.280 --> 02:03:51.760]   But I mean Postmates is working on this robot as well.
[02:03:51.760 --> 02:03:53.520]   They have an ex-division that's working
[02:03:53.520 --> 02:03:54.400]   on robotic technology.
[02:03:54.400 --> 02:03:56.520]   This is an idea many people are tinkering with.
[02:03:56.520 --> 02:03:59.520]   - Is this so expensive that these companies really just,
[02:03:59.520 --> 02:04:01.160]   they dis this how they wanna do it?
[02:04:01.160 --> 02:04:05.160]   I think it's probably margin to be found in deliveries still.
[02:04:05.160 --> 02:04:06.480]   - Well, you don't have to have a person.
[02:04:06.480 --> 02:04:08.320]   You don't have to pay a person.
[02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:11.320]   - Are persons so expensive that anything you can do
[02:04:11.320 --> 02:04:13.680]   to get a human out of the supply chain?
[02:04:13.680 --> 02:04:16.640]   - No, you're gonna have to pay for their pesky health insurance
[02:04:16.640 --> 02:04:17.480]   and all that.
[02:04:17.480 --> 02:04:18.400]   - Amazon doesn't do that.
[02:04:18.400 --> 02:04:20.880]   They've solved that with contractors.
[02:04:20.880 --> 02:04:24.160]   - And honestly, unless somebody employs people,
[02:04:24.160 --> 02:04:26.880]   they're not gonna have money to buy Amazon prying goods.
[02:04:26.880 --> 02:04:30.400]   Maybe that's somebody else's problem.
[02:04:30.400 --> 02:04:31.760]   - It's the same market for the Apple Pro.
[02:04:31.760 --> 02:04:33.680]   Eventually there'd be eight people with a lot of money.
[02:04:33.680 --> 02:04:35.080]   It's fine.
[02:04:35.080 --> 02:04:37.440]   - I think this is cool, but I just wanna see it happen.
[02:04:37.440 --> 02:04:39.280]   - Another sign of the times.
[02:04:39.280 --> 02:04:42.080]   Facebook, you cover this kind of stuff.
[02:04:42.080 --> 02:04:46.440]   Facebook shareholders meeting.
[02:04:46.440 --> 02:04:51.440]   - 68% of investors voted to fire Mark Zuckerberg.
[02:04:51.440 --> 02:04:54.240]   - And what was the result of that vote?
[02:04:54.240 --> 02:04:55.960]   - Well, they're still okay with him as CEO,
[02:04:55.960 --> 02:04:57.640]   but they're not so crazy about him as chairman.
[02:04:57.640 --> 02:04:59.000]   - Oh, they don't mind him, CEO,
[02:04:59.000 --> 02:05:00.000]   they don't want him as chairman.
[02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:00.840]   - They believe so.
[02:05:00.840 --> 02:05:03.680]   - So they don't want him on the board,
[02:05:03.680 --> 02:05:05.560]   just 'cause then the board would run him?
[02:05:05.560 --> 02:05:06.840]   - They want him with a little bit less power
[02:05:06.840 --> 02:05:08.480]   and somebody else waiting in.
[02:05:08.480 --> 02:05:11.400]   But what percentage of voting stock does he control?
[02:05:11.400 --> 02:05:12.440]   - Well, here's the problem.
[02:05:12.440 --> 02:05:14.480]   There's, as you know, class A,
[02:05:14.480 --> 02:05:16.200]   which is what all the shareholders have,
[02:05:16.200 --> 02:05:17.520]   that's one vote per share.
[02:05:17.520 --> 02:05:19.600]   And then there's this class B stock,
[02:05:19.600 --> 02:05:21.880]   which has 10 votes for share.
[02:05:21.880 --> 02:05:25.040]   And you know who has almost all the class B stock?
[02:05:25.040 --> 02:05:26.200]   Is it the public?
[02:05:26.200 --> 02:05:28.120]   No, it's Mark Zuckerberg.
[02:05:28.120 --> 02:05:30.600]   - No, 75% in fact.
[02:05:30.600 --> 02:05:32.160]   - And that's why he controls.
[02:05:32.160 --> 02:05:34.200]   - 60% of the voting power Facebook.
[02:05:34.200 --> 02:05:39.160]   So vote all you want little shareholders, Mark,
[02:05:39.160 --> 02:05:40.120]   trumps everybody.
[02:05:40.120 --> 02:05:42.680]   - CEO, chairman, and controlling your shareholder.
[02:05:42.680 --> 02:05:44.360]   - But wouldn't you, if you were Mark Zuckerberg,
[02:05:44.360 --> 02:05:46.280]   take this a little bit seriously like,
[02:05:46.280 --> 02:05:51.280]   hmm, hmm, if that, a huge majority of your shareholders,
[02:05:51.280 --> 02:05:56.080]   of your, you know, private shareholders want you out?
[02:05:56.080 --> 02:05:58.200]   - If the stock plummets he has to take that seriously.
[02:05:58.200 --> 02:06:00.160]   - Ah, it's all about the price.
[02:06:00.160 --> 02:06:01.640]   They're not selling their shares.
[02:06:01.640 --> 02:06:03.800]   They're voting, but they're not selling their shares.
[02:06:03.800 --> 02:06:05.160]   - Hmm.
[02:06:05.160 --> 02:06:06.000]   - Interesting.
[02:06:06.000 --> 02:06:09.520]   - Facebook has had a really tough
[02:06:09.520 --> 02:06:11.680]   couple of, I don't know, year, I wanna say,
[02:06:11.680 --> 02:06:12.800]   maybe even two years now.
[02:06:12.800 --> 02:06:14.760]   And I just pull out their stock price.
[02:06:14.760 --> 02:06:18.200]   They peaked at 210, give or take,
[02:06:18.200 --> 02:06:20.560]   fell all the way down to 125.
[02:06:20.560 --> 02:06:22.400]   And now they're back up to the 180s.
[02:06:22.400 --> 02:06:23.440]   So they've recovered enough.
[02:06:23.440 --> 02:06:24.280]   There's no pressure on him.
[02:06:24.280 --> 02:06:25.240]   - They're doing all right.
[02:06:25.240 --> 02:06:26.080]   - Yeah.
[02:06:26.080 --> 02:06:27.520]   - I mean, there's a big move in Silicon Valley
[02:06:27.520 --> 02:06:29.480]   to have more founder friendly terms from investors,
[02:06:29.480 --> 02:06:31.000]   to get founders more controlled longer
[02:06:31.000 --> 02:06:32.000]   than for life of companies.
[02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:33.000]   Snap has done this.
[02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:34.840]   - A lot of it because of Facebook, right?
[02:06:34.840 --> 02:06:35.680]   - I think they said so.
[02:06:35.680 --> 02:06:37.440]   - This was the model, Mark,
[02:06:37.440 --> 02:06:39.560]   was the benevolent dictator for life.
[02:06:39.560 --> 02:06:41.360]   And it's worked out very well for Facebook,
[02:06:41.360 --> 02:06:42.560]   well, it had until recently.
[02:06:42.560 --> 02:06:43.680]   - I mean, it's worked out well for Facebook,
[02:06:43.680 --> 02:06:45.360]   even still, their revenue's growing,
[02:06:45.360 --> 02:06:46.600]   their market footprints increasing,
[02:06:46.600 --> 02:06:47.440]   and their profits are going up.
[02:06:47.440 --> 02:06:50.720]   - So what do you think about them doing a cryptocurrency?
[02:06:50.720 --> 02:06:53.440]   - I mean, I'm trying to find a way to be nice about this.
[02:06:53.440 --> 02:06:56.280]   - That's gonna be launched in nine days.
[02:06:56.280 --> 02:06:58.560]   - I mean, percent of people,
[02:06:58.560 --> 02:07:00.480]   why, why not just have a digital currency
[02:07:00.480 --> 02:07:01.880]   without a blockchain?
[02:07:01.880 --> 02:07:03.400]   Blockchains are slow.
[02:07:03.400 --> 02:07:04.600]   It's gonna be centralized anyways,
[02:07:04.600 --> 02:07:06.440]   so it's not gonna have the better parts of blockchain,
[02:07:06.440 --> 02:07:07.520]   or decentralization.
[02:07:07.520 --> 02:07:09.080]   Facebook's not gonna give anyone else control
[02:07:09.080 --> 02:07:10.520]   of their digital currency.
[02:07:10.520 --> 02:07:11.640]   So which means marketing's done,
[02:07:11.640 --> 02:07:13.240]   attached to an idea that I don't want,
[02:07:13.240 --> 02:07:14.360]   that they're gonna spread across a platform
[02:07:14.360 --> 02:07:16.160]   that people are trying to not use.
[02:07:16.160 --> 02:07:20.280]   - We don't know what it'll be called.
[02:07:20.280 --> 02:07:21.640]   Libra is the codename.
[02:07:21.640 --> 02:07:24.560]   It will be a stable coin.
[02:07:24.560 --> 02:07:25.840]   So that means the price,
[02:07:25.840 --> 02:07:27.640]   you're the financial whiz here.
[02:07:27.640 --> 02:07:28.560]   - It's pegged.
[02:07:28.560 --> 02:07:29.400]   - It's pegged.
[02:07:29.400 --> 02:07:32.320]   It doesn't, as Bitcoin, which is the wild fluctuation,
[02:07:32.320 --> 02:07:33.160]   is one of the things,
[02:07:33.160 --> 02:07:34.600]   one of the many things that hurt Bitcoin.
[02:07:34.600 --> 02:07:36.800]   It won't have those wild fluctuations.
[02:07:36.800 --> 02:07:37.640]   - No, for example,
[02:07:37.640 --> 02:07:39.760]   Tether is a stable coin that's pegged to the US dollar,
[02:07:39.760 --> 02:07:42.440]   one Tether is equivalent to one USD.
[02:07:42.440 --> 02:07:43.640]   - But that eliminates the investors,
[02:07:43.640 --> 02:07:45.520]   but it eliminates the speculators as well, right?
[02:07:45.520 --> 02:07:47.360]   And I guess that's better not to have speculation.
[02:07:47.360 --> 02:07:49.000]   - So how do you drive uptake then?
[02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:51.080]   You might have to have a useful on the Facebook platform
[02:07:51.080 --> 02:07:53.640]   in a way that other currencies wouldn't be.
[02:07:53.640 --> 02:07:55.760]   Perhaps it's good for cross-border transfers of money,
[02:07:55.760 --> 02:07:58.840]   but I don't really currently see the need for it.
[02:07:58.840 --> 02:07:59.680]   And I don't wanna be,
[02:07:59.680 --> 02:08:00.720]   I've been kind of mean on the show,
[02:08:00.720 --> 02:08:02.000]   so I'm trying to find something nice to say.
[02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:04.880]   - You'll be able to use it, I guess, within Facebook,
[02:08:04.880 --> 02:08:06.000]   in the Facebook ecosystem,
[02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:08.680]   you could transfer it among Facebook properties.
[02:08:08.680 --> 02:08:10.760]   The article on TechCrunch says,
[02:08:10.760 --> 02:08:12.280]   Facebook's working with merchants
[02:08:12.280 --> 02:08:13.720]   to accept the token as payment.
[02:08:13.720 --> 02:08:14.960]   We'll see how that works.
[02:08:14.960 --> 02:08:16.640]   - In the era of Venmo,
[02:08:16.640 --> 02:08:18.200]   I feel like we've already kind of solved
[02:08:18.200 --> 02:08:20.640]   the money transfer problem in truck countries.
[02:08:20.640 --> 02:08:22.400]   So if it's not in terra country,
[02:08:22.400 --> 02:08:23.840]   I don't particularly care.
[02:08:23.840 --> 02:08:24.840]   - According to the information,
[02:08:24.840 --> 02:08:26.400]   they're gonna roll out,
[02:08:26.400 --> 02:08:27.240]   I don't know what this means,
[02:08:27.240 --> 02:08:29.480]   physical devices for ATMs,
[02:08:30.320 --> 02:08:35.040]   so that you could bring your money to and buy Facebook coin.
[02:08:35.040 --> 02:08:35.920]   - Well, let's come up with the name of them.
[02:08:35.920 --> 02:08:37.480]   Let's call them like Zuck Bucks.
[02:08:37.480 --> 02:08:39.160]   - Zuck Bucks, I like it.
[02:08:39.160 --> 02:08:41.400]   How many Zuck Bucks are you gonna buy?
[02:08:41.400 --> 02:08:42.400]   - No Zuck Bucks.
[02:08:42.400 --> 02:08:44.680]   - Yep, I'm not on Facebook anymore.
[02:08:44.680 --> 02:08:45.880]   So that's zero, you?
[02:08:45.880 --> 02:08:47.600]   - Yeah, I don't know.
[02:08:47.600 --> 02:08:48.600]   I have a lot of--
[02:08:48.600 --> 02:08:51.280]   - I'm on Facebook, I don't really spend money there.
[02:08:51.280 --> 02:08:53.200]   - You know what I would buy?
[02:08:53.200 --> 02:08:56.880]   An Axe body wash with the Xbox logo on it.
[02:08:56.880 --> 02:08:58.920]   Now, as a Apex legend player,
[02:08:58.920 --> 02:09:01.680]   you probably not in the market for this.
[02:09:01.680 --> 02:09:04.880]   You know, this announcement produced in partnership
[02:09:04.880 --> 02:09:07.000]   with the makers of Axe Body Spray.
[02:09:07.000 --> 02:09:12.000]   This announcement of the Xbox links body wash and deodorant
[02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:16.000]   really kind of makes me think that they're saying,
[02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:18.840]   we stink, gamers stink, is that what they're saying?
[02:09:18.840 --> 02:09:22.680]   - Look, gamers are not famous for hygiene.
[02:09:22.680 --> 02:09:23.520]   - That's what they're saying.
[02:09:23.520 --> 02:09:26.120]   - It's gotten better in the era of esports and like cameras,
[02:09:26.120 --> 02:09:28.200]   but I do think that they're gonna sell
[02:09:28.200 --> 02:09:30.640]   more of those bottles of Xbox Axe
[02:09:30.640 --> 02:09:32.760]   than we would think reasonable.
[02:09:32.760 --> 02:09:35.520]   And if it leads to cleaner children putting my mom head on,
[02:09:35.520 --> 02:09:36.360]   what's wrong with that?
[02:09:36.360 --> 02:09:38.960]   - That's wrong, what's wrong with cleaner children?
[02:09:38.960 --> 02:09:40.200]   Do silly things.
[02:09:40.200 --> 02:09:43.600]   - There is such thing as too much Axe Body Spray though.
[02:09:43.600 --> 02:09:44.440]   - Oh yeah.
[02:09:44.440 --> 02:09:45.280]   - Famously so.
[02:09:45.280 --> 02:09:46.720]   - Oh yeah.
[02:09:46.720 --> 02:09:48.800]   - But body wash is relatively, you shower it off,
[02:09:48.800 --> 02:09:50.280]   so you can't really get too stinky.
[02:09:50.280 --> 02:09:51.120]   - Right, yeah.
[02:09:51.120 --> 02:09:53.680]   - Well, oh yeah, you've not smelled Axe apparently.
[02:09:53.680 --> 02:09:56.680]   - I told these the spray, but if it's a body wash,
[02:09:57.600 --> 02:09:59.200]   well give me a sniff.
[02:09:59.200 --> 02:10:02.160]   - I don't even know how to interpret that,
[02:10:02.160 --> 02:10:04.280]   but no way that I could is good.
[02:10:04.280 --> 02:10:05.120]   - I know, I know way.
[02:10:05.120 --> 02:10:07.200]   - That's why I put you between us.
[02:10:07.200 --> 02:10:09.000]   So I couldn't be harassed on the show.
[02:10:09.000 --> 02:10:11.880]   - All right, it's clearly time for us all to go home.
[02:10:11.880 --> 02:10:14.600]   I think I've done all,
[02:10:14.600 --> 02:10:17.520]   have I done everything I needed to do, Carsten?
[02:10:17.520 --> 02:10:18.360]   I have.
[02:10:18.360 --> 02:10:21.040]   - You've done everything except for more and make.
[02:10:21.040 --> 02:10:23.360]   - Oh, you're absolutely right.
[02:10:23.360 --> 02:10:25.200]   A very sad post from Dale Daugherty,
[02:10:25.200 --> 02:10:27.520]   who is the founder of Make Magazine
[02:10:27.520 --> 02:10:28.640]   and the Maker Fair,
[02:10:28.640 --> 02:10:31.360]   he announced that in fact,
[02:10:31.360 --> 02:10:33.880]   it is over for make and the Maker Fairs,
[02:10:33.880 --> 02:10:34.840]   which is a surprise.
[02:10:34.840 --> 02:10:38.320]   The ticket sales apparently for Maker Fair
[02:10:38.320 --> 02:10:41.520]   that was upcoming were right on the mark,
[02:10:41.520 --> 02:10:44.920]   but Maker Fair laid off all its staff
[02:10:44.920 --> 02:10:46.400]   and has halted operations.
[02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:48.600]   There will not be another Maker Fair.
[02:10:48.600 --> 02:10:50.000]   Dale, who is a great guy,
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.360]   we've interviewed many times on our shows,
[02:10:52.360 --> 02:10:54.640]   says he's hoping to find,
[02:10:54.640 --> 02:10:56.920]   he said the business model wasn't good,
[02:10:56.920 --> 02:10:58.840]   but he's hoping to find somebody who can help him,
[02:10:58.840 --> 02:11:01.400]   at least keep the magazine printing.
[02:11:01.400 --> 02:11:02.840]   'Cause I think a lot of people got a lot
[02:11:02.840 --> 02:11:03.760]   out of Make Magazine.
[02:11:03.760 --> 02:11:04.600]   - People loved it.
[02:11:04.600 --> 02:11:05.680]   - People bought tickets.
[02:11:05.680 --> 02:11:07.280]   - It was very dependent on sponsorships.
[02:11:07.280 --> 02:11:10.880]   So kind of the same issue as other forms of media
[02:11:10.880 --> 02:11:12.680]   that people still love debt,
[02:11:12.680 --> 02:11:17.120]   but you need sponsors and advertisers
[02:11:17.120 --> 02:11:18.280]   to put up the money.
[02:11:18.280 --> 02:11:20.800]   - And Microsoft and Autodesk did not sponsor
[02:11:20.800 --> 02:11:21.960]   this year's Maker Fair,
[02:11:21.960 --> 02:11:25.480]   and that was, I think, probably the approximate cost.
[02:11:25.480 --> 02:11:27.720]   But you can't blame Microsoft and Autodesk,
[02:11:27.720 --> 02:11:29.960]   I think this is a man.
[02:11:29.960 --> 02:11:30.960]   If they just called me,
[02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:32.600]   I would have given him whatever they need.
[02:11:32.600 --> 02:11:34.800]   - Palmer, Lucky also says he'll give him whatever.
[02:11:34.800 --> 02:11:35.880]   - Palmer's got some money,
[02:11:35.880 --> 02:11:37.520]   the creator of--
[02:11:37.520 --> 02:11:40.040]   - Oculus Rift. - Oculus Rift.
[02:11:40.040 --> 02:11:41.880]   He says, "I loved Maker Fair
[02:11:41.880 --> 02:11:44.800]   "been a make-reader literally since the first issue.
[02:11:44.800 --> 02:11:48.360]   "Some friends and I would love to save Maker Media."
[02:11:48.360 --> 02:11:51.480]   So maybe an angel will come.
[02:11:51.480 --> 02:11:56.280]   And there is, I think, maybe,
[02:11:56.280 --> 02:11:59.160]   Dockety says he's aware of Lucky's interest
[02:11:59.160 --> 02:12:01.160]   and a GoFundMe page that was started.
[02:12:01.160 --> 02:12:02.800]   So maybe there, maybe it's not over.
[02:12:02.800 --> 02:12:07.400]   It would be a really great thing to bring this,
[02:12:07.400 --> 02:12:08.240]   keep this alive.
[02:12:08.240 --> 02:12:10.160]   'Cause as people point out,
[02:12:10.160 --> 02:12:11.000]   the subscriptions were good,
[02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.440]   they had 25,000 paid subscribers,
[02:12:13.440 --> 02:12:15.680]   a million YouTube subscribers.
[02:12:15.680 --> 02:12:17.240]   The Maker Fair event last week
[02:12:17.240 --> 02:12:19.240]   met its ticket sales target.
[02:12:19.240 --> 02:12:22.360]   1.45 million people attended Maker Fairs in 2016.
[02:12:22.360 --> 02:12:26.320]   It's by every measurement, it sounds like a success.
[02:12:26.320 --> 02:12:27.160]   But as you point out,
[02:12:27.160 --> 02:12:28.640]   they don't make money on tickets alone.
[02:12:28.640 --> 02:12:31.000]   They've got to have sponsorships.
[02:12:31.000 --> 02:12:32.680]   All right, now,
[02:12:32.680 --> 02:12:35.560]   we do like to put obituaries at the end of the show.
[02:12:35.560 --> 02:12:36.840]   Is anybody else dead?
[02:12:36.840 --> 02:12:39.360]   - Nope.
[02:12:39.360 --> 02:12:41.120]   - I mean, pulse check, but I think we'll get to--
[02:12:41.120 --> 02:12:43.040]   - A chicken was probably just killed.
[02:12:43.040 --> 02:12:45.240]   - Oh my God, the chickens.
[02:12:45.240 --> 02:12:47.840]   'Cause think of the chickens, that's Megan Maroney.
[02:12:47.840 --> 02:12:50.400]   She will be back Tuesday for iOS today.
[02:12:50.400 --> 02:12:53.560]   - Yes, even before that, tomorrow,
[02:12:53.560 --> 02:12:56.480]   I am interviewing Julian Guthrie, who wrote Alpha Girls.
[02:12:56.480 --> 02:13:01.000]   She profiles four venture capitalists,
[02:13:01.000 --> 02:13:06.000]   some of the early women who pioneered the--
[02:13:06.000 --> 02:13:09.600]   - And that'll be for an upcoming triangulation.
[02:13:09.600 --> 02:13:10.440]   - That's trying to, but you can watch live,
[02:13:10.440 --> 02:13:11.880]   that'll be at 3PM, so--
[02:13:11.880 --> 02:13:13.640]   - 3PM Pacific, 6PM Eastern.
[02:13:13.640 --> 02:13:14.480]   - Yes, I'm very excited.
[02:13:14.480 --> 02:13:15.480]   - And on Monday.
[02:13:15.480 --> 02:13:17.160]   - And on Friday, I interviewed Trey Rechliff
[02:13:17.160 --> 02:13:19.120]   about his book, Under the Influence,
[02:13:19.120 --> 02:13:22.280]   all about the bailful influence of influencers on Instagram.
[02:13:22.280 --> 02:13:24.360]   And he was great, that was, so that--
[02:13:24.360 --> 02:13:26.320]   - Did that triangulation, that's not coming out yet.
[02:13:26.320 --> 02:13:31.320]   - No, that will air the first week in July, I believe.
[02:13:31.320 --> 02:13:33.680]   - Next month, look for that.
[02:13:33.680 --> 02:13:39.240]   Alex Wilhelm will be married in two weeks.
[02:13:39.240 --> 02:13:40.320]   - Yes, I will not be here.
[02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:41.800]   - Congratulations.
[02:13:41.800 --> 02:13:42.640]   - Thank you.
[02:13:42.640 --> 02:13:43.640]   - That's wonderful, I'm really excited.
[02:13:43.640 --> 02:13:44.760]   - I have some advice for you.
[02:13:44.760 --> 02:13:45.600]   - Please.
[02:13:45.600 --> 02:13:46.680]   - 19 years.
[02:13:46.680 --> 02:13:50.000]   - Yeah, so when you were, we were talking earlier,
[02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:51.840]   and then Liza called, and I said, you can take that,
[02:13:51.840 --> 02:13:55.040]   and he answered the phone and said, hello, gorgeous.
[02:13:55.040 --> 02:13:56.640]   - Good move, keep doing that.
[02:13:56.640 --> 02:13:57.480]   - Keep doing that.
[02:13:57.480 --> 02:13:58.680]   - That's all you need to do.
[02:13:58.680 --> 02:13:59.880]   - Keep doing that.
[02:13:59.880 --> 02:14:00.720]   - It was so sweet.
[02:14:00.720 --> 02:14:01.960]   - They are such a cute couple,
[02:14:01.960 --> 02:14:04.320]   and the fact that they live in my childhood home
[02:14:04.320 --> 02:14:06.040]   is not in any way.
[02:14:06.040 --> 02:14:06.880]   - That's true.
[02:14:06.880 --> 02:14:08.200]   - Still my favorite coincidence I've ever been a part of.
[02:14:08.200 --> 02:14:09.440]   - Like the actual building?
[02:14:09.440 --> 02:14:10.920]   - No, it's the same house.
[02:14:10.920 --> 02:14:13.120]   - So Liza was out here, we were getting ready
[02:14:13.120 --> 02:14:15.200]   for a new screen savers, and we're talking about,
[02:14:15.200 --> 02:14:16.560]   she says, I live in Providence.
[02:14:16.560 --> 02:14:18.800]   And I said, I grew up in Providence, that's so cool.
[02:14:18.800 --> 02:14:19.680]   She said, where did you grow up?
[02:14:19.680 --> 02:14:21.320]   I said, I named the street, I won't say it,
[02:14:21.320 --> 02:14:22.160]   I don't want you to be a doctor.
[02:14:22.160 --> 02:14:23.000]   - Thank you.
[02:14:23.000 --> 02:14:24.480]   - And she said, oh really?
[02:14:24.480 --> 02:14:25.680]   Really on that street?
[02:14:25.680 --> 02:14:26.920]   What number?
[02:14:26.920 --> 02:14:29.160]   And I told her the number, she said, that's where I live.
[02:14:29.160 --> 02:14:31.160]   Her parents had, I guess, bought the house.
[02:14:31.160 --> 02:14:34.520]   And now she's living there as she goes to med school.
[02:14:34.520 --> 02:14:35.360]   She's gonna.
[02:14:35.360 --> 02:14:36.200]   - No, now she's a resident.
[02:14:36.200 --> 02:14:37.840]   - I'm sorry, she's been through med school,
[02:14:37.840 --> 02:14:40.720]   she's now a resident at where?
[02:14:40.720 --> 02:14:42.040]   - Med school at Tulane.
[02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:44.600]   - Oh, nice, and resident at Providence Hospital.
[02:14:44.600 --> 02:14:46.900]   - It's a collection of brown and some
[02:14:46.900 --> 02:14:49.120]   local hospitals, it's a medical world,
[02:14:49.120 --> 02:14:50.920]   it's very confusing to me.
[02:14:50.920 --> 02:14:53.480]   - So in fact, I think you have a video
[02:14:53.480 --> 02:14:55.000]   that I'm going to see after the show.
[02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:55.840]   - I was just about to tell people,
[02:14:55.840 --> 02:14:56.640]   they can't see the public video.
[02:14:56.640 --> 02:14:58.240]   - We don't wanna show that public,
[02:14:58.240 --> 02:15:00.960]   but of the Amazon drone landing on your corgi
[02:15:00.960 --> 02:15:02.480]   in the backyard, I grew up in.
[02:15:02.480 --> 02:15:04.480]   - It's a haven-ease, but close, yes.
[02:15:04.480 --> 02:15:06.720]   It doesn't end well for scout or no one.
[02:15:06.720 --> 02:15:09.640]   - Great to have you, please come back.
[02:15:09.640 --> 02:15:12.440]   I love having you on @alex on the Twitter,
[02:15:12.440 --> 02:15:15.000]   and of course Crunchbase News where he is
[02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:18.520]   pretty high ranking monkey muck, an editor in chief.
[02:15:18.520 --> 02:15:20.240]   - Of a team of eight, but yes.
[02:15:20.240 --> 02:15:22.440]   - Eight people, that's a lot.
[02:15:22.440 --> 02:15:24.040]   And the great technologist here himself,
[02:15:24.040 --> 02:15:26.400]   Harry McCracken, who is also an editor,
[02:15:26.400 --> 02:15:28.360]   a technology editor at Fast Company,
[02:15:28.360 --> 02:15:29.920]   anything you wanna plug?
[02:15:29.920 --> 02:15:31.560]   Well, you can't tell us you're upcoming.
[02:15:31.560 --> 02:15:32.400]   - I have some good stuff coming up
[02:15:32.400 --> 02:15:34.360]   in the next week or two, so keep clicking
[02:15:34.360 --> 02:15:36.080]   on Fast Company and you'll see it eventually.
[02:15:36.080 --> 02:15:38.840]   - I forgot the byline, I just read of yours,
[02:15:38.840 --> 02:15:40.120]   it was a great story, you do.
[02:15:40.120 --> 02:15:42.120]   I like the long form stuff, it's really fun.
[02:15:42.120 --> 02:15:45.080]   And Harry has a real love as I do
[02:15:45.080 --> 02:15:46.760]   for the history of technology.
[02:15:46.760 --> 02:15:49.360]   So those history pieces are always of great interest.
[02:15:49.360 --> 02:15:50.800]   I think that was what I was reading,
[02:15:50.800 --> 02:15:52.960]   but I forgot, it's gone out of my head.
[02:15:52.960 --> 02:15:58.320]   I'm gonna go home and watch the last game of Thrones again.
[02:15:58.320 --> 02:16:00.720]   So, no, I'm not.
[02:16:00.720 --> 02:16:03.760]   I have other planets.
[02:16:03.760 --> 02:16:08.120]   And oh man, I just almost got myself in big trouble,
[02:16:08.120 --> 02:16:09.880]   but I'm not gonna say what I was gonna say,
[02:16:09.880 --> 02:16:11.200]   but you know what I was gonna say,
[02:16:11.200 --> 02:16:13.040]   and you know what I was gonna say,
[02:16:13.040 --> 02:16:14.160]   but I'll tell you what I'm gonna say,

[02:17:06.800 --> 02:17:07.720]   Not anymore anymore.
[02:17:07.720 --> 02:17:09.160]   - No, definitely not.
