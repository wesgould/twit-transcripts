[00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:36.140]   We're going to go to the grocery store.
[00:14:36.140 --> 00:14:43.140]   We're going to go to the grocery store.

[00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:16.140]   We're going to go to the grocery store.
[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:23.140]   We're going to go to the grocery store.

[00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:58.140]   We're going to go to the grocery store.
[00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:05.140]   We're going to go to the grocery store.
[00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:12.140]   We're going to go to the grocery store.
[00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:19.140]   We're going to go to the grocery store.
[00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:26.140]   We're going to go to the grocery store.
[00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:33.140]   We're going to go to the grocery store.
[00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:40.140]   We're going to go to the grocery store.
[00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:47.140]   We're going to go to the grocery store.
[00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:54.140]   We're going to go to the grocery store.
[00:18:54.140 --> 00:19:01.140]   We're going to go to the grocery store.
[00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:08.140]   We're going to go to the grocery store.
[00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:19.140]   We're going to go to the grocery store.
[00:19:19.140 --> 00:19:28.140]   We're going to go to the grocery store.
[00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:34.140]   We're going to go to the grocery store.
[00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:38.140]   We'll have an Xbox One tear down next week.
[00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:41.140]   We did do an Xbox PlayStation 4 tear down minutes ago.
[00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:44.140]   One of the things we're seeing, and I just looked at Amazon.com.
[00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:49.140]   Of the almost 2000 reviews on Amazon.com for the PlayStation 4 launch edition,
[00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:54.140]   there are about 500 one-star reviews for people who say it was
[00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:58.140]   "bricked on arrival" or "bricked after I installed the update."
[00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:01.140]   Blue screen of death or blue circle of death.
[00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:03.140]   People are complaining about this sounds a little familiar.
[00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:06.140]   Sounds like any hardware launch.
[00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:07.140]   Especially the gaming industry.
[00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:09.140]   I'm not sure if anything.
[00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:11.140]   You're going to have a few thousand.
[00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:15.140]   The iPad Air has a couple of blue screen issues.
[00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:17.140]   This is an air.
[00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:19.140]   I had Safari crash on me several times.
[00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:21.140]   I was reading the show.
[00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:22.140]   That's depressing.
[00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:23.140]   I just picked up a retinomini.
[00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:24.140]   I love the mini.
[00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:25.140]   I got my mini.
[00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:29.140]   There are already people saying "image retention problems on the retinomini."
[00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:31.140]   It just doesn't end.
[00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:33.140]   Nothing's perfect when you make millions of them.
[00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:35.140]   I'm very happy with the mini.
[00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:36.140]   I thought too.
[00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:38.140]   I have both an air and a mini.
[00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:40.140]   It seems like it has all the advantages of an air.
[00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:41.140]   Boy, is it fast.
[00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:43.140]   A lot faster than last year's mini.
[00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:48.140]   Which had a two-generational processor in it.
[00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:51.140]   I think the screen is gorgeous and I like that size.
[00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:52.140]   It's really more of an interface.
[00:20:52.140 --> 00:20:54.140]   Yeah, it's my first 7-inch tablet.
[00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:55.140]   It's cool.
[00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:57.140]   There's two big-sized iPads before it.
[00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:58.140]   It's more portable.
[00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:00.140]   It's easier to read.
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:01.140]   Slip in your pocket.
[00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:04.140]   It's not much bigger than that Bloomberg card you've got there.
[00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:07.140]   It's not much bigger than a Samsung Mega.
[00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:10.140]   There's a 6.5-inch phone or whatever it is.
[00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:12.140]   What is it called?
[00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:13.140]   The Mega.
[00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:14.140]   The Mega.
[00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:15.140]   Mega.
[00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:16.140]   It's ridiculous.
[00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:18.140]   I'm like really guys.
[00:21:18.140 --> 00:21:23.140]   I want to do a Goldilocks and a 3-bearers spoof with different Samsung phones.
[00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:26.140]   This one's, you have the note, the Mega.
[00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:27.140]   Something else.
[00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:28.140]   It's too big.
[00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:29.140]   This is too whatever.
[00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:30.140]   This is just right.
[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:31.140]   It's just ridiculous.
[00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:37.140]   Somebody, Miriam Jour, had the HTC One Mega or what it is.
[00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:38.140]   Max.
[00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:39.140]   Same thing.
[00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:40.140]   It's like, what is this?
[00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:41.140]   This is swollen.
[00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:42.140]   This phone is swollen.
[00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:45.140]   You need to get an anti-inflammatory quickly.
[00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:46.140]   It's kind of-
[00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:47.140]   Some topical cream.
[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:48.140]   Some topical cream.
[00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:50.140]   Something's really wrong with his phone.
[00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:52.140]   Well, lines for the PlayStation 4.
[00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:56.140]   We'll see if they're lines for the Xbox One.
[00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:59.140]   It's interesting to see that the console has really survived.
[00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:00.140]   Yeah.
[00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:06.700]   I mean, my focus group of two, which is my daughters, I can tell you that consoles are not anything
[00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:10.140]   that they've asked for for the holidays or birthdays.
[00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:15.020]   Given the choice between playing Wii or playing console games and sitting and watching Minecraft
[00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:16.020]   videos, Minecraft.
[00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:18.020]   Yeah, it's all about Minecraft.
[00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:19.020]   It's all about Minecraft.
[00:22:19.020 --> 00:22:20.020]   It's all about Minecraft.
[00:22:20.020 --> 00:22:21.020]   Totally.
[00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:26.100]   You should get them at a Disney infinity because it's amazing because it's Minecraft.
[00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:28.100]   It's the greatest thing I've ever played.
[00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:29.100]   I'm sorry.
[00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:31.100]   Did you say Minecraft with Disney characters?
[00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:32.100]   Yes.
[00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:33.100]   Mickey Mouse is the creeper.
[00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:34.100]   Yeah.
[00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:35.100]   So is it 8-bit?
[00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:36.100]   No.
[00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:41.100]   It's 360 for PS3 for Wii, for Wii U. It's awesome.
[00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:45.620]   It's basically- they've got regular platformer games you can go through and earn points.
[00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:47.380]   But the best part is they've got this toy box mode.
[00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:51.780]   So it's kind of like Skyrim in that you've got actual physical toys.
[00:22:51.780 --> 00:22:53.420]   But it's high quality graphics.
[00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:54.420]   Totally high quality.
[00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:55.420]   Yeah.
[00:22:55.420 --> 00:23:00.340]   What's great about it is when you go into this, they call it the toy box mode, you can create
[00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:01.500]   your whole world.
[00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:05.580]   And they actually have different things like logic based setups you can do.
[00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:10.020]   So if you jump on this platform and then this action will occur and then this will happen.
[00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:13.700]   So people have actually done things like they've recreated the very first level of the original
[00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:14.700]   Super Mario Brothers.
[00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:17.700]   And people have done things like recreating Mario Kart and things like that.
[00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:19.340]   And you can do all kinds of stuff.
[00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:23.020]   And then you unlock these different things in the toy box mode so you can have all these
[00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:24.500]   different characters playing together.
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:28.380]   And it's basically- like seriously, like I would describe it as taking the best parts
[00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:30.900]   of Minecraft with Disney and Pixar characters.
[00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:32.980]   Is it a completely open world?
[00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:33.980]   Yes.
[00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:36.100]   I mean, they've got a game part where you can play the games.
[00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:40.380]   But then the toy box mode is completely open world where you can do whatever you want.
[00:23:40.380 --> 00:23:42.380]   And you can have all sorts of characters interacting together.
[00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:45.300]   And all the Disney characters are in there?
[00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:46.500]   And they keep adding more and more.
[00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:48.740]   Like I just got some more toys this week.
[00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:50.420]   But I mean, they've got all kinds of stuff.
[00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:53.820]   You know, a lot of the Pixar characters and a lot of the classic Disney things you can
[00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:57.100]   put in like Cinderella's castle or like the castle from Sleeping Beauty.
[00:23:57.100 --> 00:24:01.140]   And you can build and like even have ESPN like score signs and stuff like that.
[00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:03.180]   And they've got like the Wreck It Ralph guys.
[00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:05.580]   And it's really, really fun.
[00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:06.580]   I love it.
[00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:07.580]   I love it.
[00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:08.580]   Anybody who tells my kids about this.
[00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:09.580]   Yeah.
[00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:10.580]   It's got to say-
[00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:11.580]   It's got to say-
[00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:12.580]   It's got to say-

[00:24:17.580 --> 00:24:18.580]   It's got to say-
[00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:19.580]   It's got to say-
[00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:20.580]   It's got to say-
[00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:21.580]   It's got to say-
[00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:22.580]   It's got to say-
[00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:23.580]   It's got to say-
[00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:24.580]   It's got to say-
[00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:25.580]   It's got to say-

[00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:31.580]   It's got to say-
[00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:32.580]   It's got to say-
[00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:33.580]   It's got to say-
[00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:34.580]   It's got to say-

[00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:33.580]   That's the rumor.

[00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:46.580]   What a surprise.
[00:36:46.580 --> 00:36:49.580]   It is the problem is.
[00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:52.580]   Reason Facebook's willing to pay $3 billion is it's more popular
[00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:54.580]   than Facebook with kids.
[00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:57.580]   As is Instagram, which they buy per million dollars.
[00:36:57.580 --> 00:36:59.580]   Not necessarily only with kids.
[00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:02.580]   I mean, it's projected to pass Facebook in the number of photos
[00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:05.580]   that are exchanged per day.
[00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:06.580]   None of which you could say.
[00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:08.580]   Perhaps by the end of the year.
[00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:10.580]   It's interesting that a product that could potentially be
[00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:13.580]   worth millions of dollars is based on just extremely poor
[00:37:13.580 --> 00:37:15.580]   judgment by its users.
[00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:16.580]   Right.
[00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:18.580]   Who knew that was a feature?
[00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:19.580]   But apparently it is.
[00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:21.580]   Well, and they're in.
[00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:24.580]   We're discerning because they're not publishing pictures publicly.
[00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:26.580]   I think that's why kids like it.
[00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:28.580]   They know that these pictures don't live.
[00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:31.580]   So I can say a silly video or send a picture.
[00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:36.580]   My kids use it and contrary to what most old folks like me think,
[00:37:36.580 --> 00:37:39.580]   the kids aren't using this for sex team.
[00:37:39.580 --> 00:37:40.580]   They're just.
[00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:41.580]   Oh, they are.
[00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:42.580]   Yeah.
[00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:44.580]   But that's not all it's for our illusions.
[00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:45.580]   No, it's not all.
[00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:46.580]   It's one of the funny things.
[00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:48.580]   I mean, I use it with some of my friends and most in each other
[00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:50.580]   ridiculous things, but no, absolutely.
[00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:51.580]   Of course, it's been used for sex.
[00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:54.580]   You know, I'm sure it is, but I don't think it's as much as one
[00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:56.580]   might assume it's entirely for sex.
[00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:57.580]   Yeah, I mean, everything's used for sex.
[00:37:57.580 --> 00:37:58.580]   Right.
[00:37:58.580 --> 00:37:59.580]   Anthony, what is it?
[00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:00.580]   Twitter for sex thing.
[00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:02.580]   But I think it's just fun.
[00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:04.580]   Kids like it and they like the idea they can send goofy pictures
[00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:06.580]   and not have to worry about them living forever.
[00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:09.580]   It shows the kids are more savvy about privacy than we might have
[00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:10.580]   imagined.
[00:38:10.580 --> 00:38:13.580]   No, the ephemeral nature of it is certainly huge, but personally,
[00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:15.580]   I mean, look, I'm not going to lie.
[00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:17.580]   I'm totally just like I just said in the chat, I'm totally waiting
[00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:21.580]   for this thing to just go totally group on so I can laugh my
[00:38:21.580 --> 00:38:25.580]   ass off because no, this is not worth four million dollars.
[00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:27.580]   There is no they don't even have.
[00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:28.580]   There's no revenue.
[00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:29.580]   No, exactly.
[00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:32.580]   And the thing is, is that you have to wonder how long of a mean,
[00:38:32.580 --> 00:38:33.580]   okay, so great.
[00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:35.580]   This is the platform where everyone is using for this sort of
[00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:38.580]   thing and clearly, you know, Facebook tried to create a copy
[00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:41.580]   cat and it didn't work, which makes total sense because part
[00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:43.580]   of the reason you use it is because it's not Facebook, right?
[00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:46.580]   And you know, you don't necessarily trust Facebook not to
[00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:48.580]   store copies of it everywhere.
[00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:50.580]   Although, you know what, I don't necessarily trust Snapchat not
[00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:52.580]   to have copies of a lot of this stuff.
[00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:57.580]   No, in fact, as we know, the NSA at least does access.
[00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:58.580]   Totally.
[00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:02.580]   And there are lots of programs that are with Snapchat.
[00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:04.580]   Of course, as with anything, you could always do a screenshot,
[00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:05.580]   but Snapchat's designed.
[00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:08.580]   So if your buddy takes a screenshot at all,
[00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:11.580]   notify you, Leo took a screenshot of that picture,
[00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:13.580]   but there's ways around that.
[00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:16.580]   In fact, 10 boys, this is actually very sad.
[00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:20.580]   We're just try or arrested and accused.
[00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:25.580]   These boys are aged 13 to 15 of using Snapchat to make child
[00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:28.580]   pornography in Canada and Quebec.
[00:39:28.580 --> 00:39:33.580]   And see that right there to me is why it's really not worth $4
[00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:36.580]   billion because you've got to have checks in place for things
[00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:37.580]   like that, right?
[00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:40.580]   Like if you were to be actually bought and vetted by a real
[00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:43.580]   public company, you would have to make sure that there were
[00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:46.580]   things or filters or something in place so that that sort of
[00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:49.580]   thing can be reported because I mean, that's the sort of
[00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:52.580]   thing where if it happens enough, that that will take down no
[00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:53.580]   matter what your business is.
[00:39:53.580 --> 00:39:54.580]   You know what I mean?
[00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:58.580]   Like if there's any whiff of being a haven for child porn,
[00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:01.580]   then that will take down your business.
[00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:06.580]   Well, and this is why it's, as you said, Mark, everything can
[00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:07.580]   be used for this kind of stuff.
[00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:11.580]   But the reason that this is perhaps more of an issue is,
[00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:14.580]   according to the police doing the investigation, the girls,
[00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:17.580]   boyfriends would say, "I'll pose for me for a picture."
[00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:20.580]   In Snapchat, the girls, according to the police, thought it was
[00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:22.580]   safe because the picture would not live forever.
[00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:24.580]   But instead, the boys were exchanging these pictures,
[00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:26.580]   saving these pictures, and eventually they were making it
[00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:27.580]   out to the internet.
[00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:31.580]   And so that's why it's more of a problem for Snapchat,
[00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:34.580]   particularly than it is, say, let's say for Twitter, where I'm
[00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:35.580]   sure the same thing happens.
[00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:39.580]   The question about Snapchat is, is it AOL instant messenger or
[00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:40.580]   is it Twitter, right?
[00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:43.580]   I mean, the reason they turned down $3 billion,
[00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:47.580]   reportedly from Facebook or for from Google, if that's true,
[00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:51.580]   is because Twitter now has a 23, 24 million,
[00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:53.580]   $3 million market cap, right?
[00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:56.580]   They, Twitter turned down lots of people that want to buy them.
[00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:57.580]   This is--
[00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:00.580]   The Snapchat thinks that it will go public and get A and B worth
[00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:01.580]   $18 billion?
[00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:04.580]   That's the only reason you turned down three or four.
[00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:05.580]   Right.
[00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:06.580]   I mean, that's why Groupon did.
[00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:08.580]   I mean, Groupon turned down 10, right?
[00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:10.580]   And Groupon really thought that it could scale.
[00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:12.580]   And then, you know, there were people like me who was like,
[00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:13.580]   "There's no way this scales.
[00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:14.580]   This doesn't work."
[00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:17.580]   And my fear with Snapchat is I think that it's a feature,
[00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:20.580]   and it's a very cool feature, but unlike Twitter, which had
[00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:23.580]   obvious API potential, and the potential would be more than just,
[00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:26.580]   you know, using it for what it was originally designed for,
[00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:30.580]   I don't know if Snapchat will ever have anything that's beyond
[00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:31.580]   kind of that sort of breakout moment.
[00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:34.580]   Do you think, Christina, are you smarter than Mark Zuckerberg?
[00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:36.580]   [ Laughs ]
[00:41:36.580 --> 00:41:37.580]   No, I'm not smart enough.
[00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:40.580]   Well, no, because Mark thinks it's worth $3 billion.
[00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:41.580]   Well, right.
[00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:44.580]   And for him, it might be, but Mark needs to get the kids on board, right?
[00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:45.580]   Yes.
[00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:47.580]   So, I mean, that's the difference, right?
[00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:50.580]   And that's why I'm saying, like, if I were Snapchat, I don't
[00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:51.580]   understand why you turn that down.
[00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:52.580]   You know, you got --
[00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:55.580]   I would snap that up so fast, because I'll tell you what,
[00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:57.580]   that $3 billion isn't going to last 30 seconds.
[00:41:57.580 --> 00:41:59.580]   It's just -- it's --
[00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:00.580]   Take a screenshot, kids.
[00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:02.580]   It's a ephemeral, and that offer is going to go.
[00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:03.580]   It's going.
[00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:04.580]   Right, right, no.
[00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:07.580]   I mean, you know, but Mark needs it for a completely different reason.
[00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:08.580]   You know, it's not about the technology.
[00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:09.580]   It's about onboarding the users.
[00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:11.580]   And that's a completely different thing.
[00:42:11.580 --> 00:42:14.580]   But he won't, because as you pointed out, kids are not stupid.
[00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:16.580]   And the reason that Polk didn't work --
[00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:19.580]   Well, right, but see, you keep the Snapchat name in the name.
[00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:20.580]   But there's still these Instagram --
[00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:22.580]   Well, that's Instagram, is exactly.
[00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:24.580]   You know, you let it run kind of as an independent company,
[00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:25.580]   the way Instagram still does.
[00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:28.580]   I mean, it's basically their ad operations and some of their
[00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:29.580]   pressing things.
[00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:31.580]   But then you don't get the value, because you really haven't
[00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:33.580]   onboarded the Instagram users to Facebook.
[00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:36.580]   They're Instagram users, not Facebook users.
[00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:37.580]   Right, but --
[00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:39.580]   Sure, I think the market -- you can go to the market and say --
[00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:41.580]   You still have all of the users, right?
[00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:42.580]   We still have all these young users.
[00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:43.580]   It doesn't matter that they're on.
[00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:46.580]   It doesn't matter if they sell the ads and reap the benefits from
[00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:47.580]   whatever evidence --
[00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:49.580]   But how do you put ads in Snapchat?
[00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:50.580]   Well, that's the problem, right?
[00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:51.580]   How do you do that?
[00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:52.580]   I mean, you could obviously --
[00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:54.580]   You could have pop-ups, right?
[00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:56.580]   But that's really going to annoy your user base.
[00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:59.580]   If you have, like, every time you send an image, you can have,
[00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:01.580]   like, a little pop-up come-up say, "Oh, you've got to watch this
[00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:03.580]   pre-roll," or you could maybe have sponsored --
[00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:05.580]   They're trying to do the story-stream thing, which is not
[00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:06.580]   going to work.
[00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:08.580]   They're storyboard idea, which no one cares about.
[00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:10.580]   You could try to have sponsored things that way,
[00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:14.580]   or you could maybe have advertisers send disappearing ads.
[00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:15.580]   I don't know.
[00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:16.580]   I mean, that's the problem, right?
[00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:20.580]   Like, I don't know how you monetize this beyond just what it is.
[00:43:20.580 --> 00:43:23.580]   I think if they had -- if it had been envisioned as something
[00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:26.580]   more than just a neat feature, then maybe you could make the
[00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:28.580]   argument that there's a better business case to be made.
[00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:31.580]   Maybe if you could integrate it into other areas.
[00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:35.580]   But it's like, you know, I don't know.
[00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:37.580]   I personally think this is going to go the way a group --
[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:38.580]   Michael Roos.
[00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:41.580]   I was going to say, I think there's a serious brand management
[00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:44.580]   challenge to say that I'm going to advertise against Snapchat
[00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:49.580]   when it is a service that has launched with this sort of --
[00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:53.580]   I don't want to say, you know, an heir of child pornography
[00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:57.580]   or inappropriate content, but if you're Procter and Gamble,
[00:43:57.580 --> 00:44:01.580]   if you're Pfizer, how are you going to position your brand
[00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:03.580]   against the disappearing photographs?
[00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:06.580]   You know where you want to be on Candy Crush Saga?
[00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:08.580]   That's where you want to be.
[00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:11.580]   I don't think it's known in the market that broadly, though,
[00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:12.580]   for that.
[00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:13.580]   I think that's maybe --
[00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:15.580]   You talk about Snapchat?
[00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:16.580]   I'm talking about Snapchat.
[00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:18.580]   Because nobody's using Candy Crush for child porn,
[00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:19.580]   I don't think.
[00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:20.580]   No, no, no.
[00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:23.580]   But I'm not sure that the market, really, when people think of it,
[00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:26.580]   that at least yet, that's what they think of.
[00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:27.580]   Oh, come on.
[00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:30.580]   In fact, it's really a problem because, in my opinion,
[00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:32.580]   Snapchat isn't really about sexting.
[00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:35.580]   It's partly sexting, but it's really more about -- and I watch
[00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:38.580]   my kids use it -- they do goofy, thick pictures.
[00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:40.580]   That's the problem is that people like me immediately hear
[00:44:40.580 --> 00:44:42.580]   about Snapchat and say, "Oh, sexting."
[00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:44.580]   It's not maybe even the reality.
[00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:46.580]   It's just that's what the most obvious thing is.
[00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:47.580]   Could be.
[00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:48.580]   Could be.
[00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:50.580]   But I think also on the monetization thing,
[00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:53.580]   remember, nobody had any freaking idea how Google was going
[00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:56.580]   to monetize, and nobody had any idea how Twitter was going
[00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:58.580]   to ever monetize itself.
[00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:02.580]   And while I would, you know, logically, you look at them now
[00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:05.580]   and it makes a lot more sense why Procter and Gamble
[00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:09.580]   would ever advertise on one of those two, you know,
[00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:13.580]   Snapchat, I mean, that thing's only been up for two years.
[00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:15.580]   I mean, it was, you know, fall of 2011.
[00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:16.580]   It's created.
[00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:17.580]   It's the money, boys.
[00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:21.580]   God, what you could do with $3 billion.
[00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:25.580]   You'd never need -- you could start a million new companies.
[00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:28.580]   But it's the hubris of Silicon Valley, right?
[00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:31.580]   It's like you're not there to -- you're not just there for the money.
[00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:35.580]   Most of the people, or at least the really passionate ones.
[00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:37.580]   Are they in Venice Beach?
[00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:38.580]   Yeah.
[00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:39.580]   You're right, they are in LA.
[00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:42.580]   You know the problem with Venice Beach is medical marijuana.
[00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:43.580]   You go -- you can't go five feet.
[00:45:43.580 --> 00:45:45.580]   You know what I mean, hence?
[00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:48.580]   They're just too high to take the money.
[00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:50.580]   We don't need the money, man.
[00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:53.580]   What are we going to be money for?
[00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:57.580]   Usually it's about wanting to, right, put a dent in the universe.
[00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:59.580]   So Steve Jobs said, and more --
[00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:02.580]   I admire that.
[00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:05.580]   I mean, I think that's great that they're not thinking about money.
[00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:09.580]   Well, one of the guys is already rich anyway, so it just kind of doesn't matter.
[00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:10.580]   Oh, really?
[00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:11.580]   Yeah.
[00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:12.580]   He's like a rich kid?
[00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:13.580]   Well, if they went to Stanford.
[00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:17.580]   I'm sure he's like a really rich kid.
[00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:18.580]   So --
[00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:20.580]   Was it these guys or was it their investors?
[00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:22.580]   Because the other side is that the investors have a lot of say in this.
[00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:23.580]   I mean, if the --
[00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:24.580]   Sure, that's very true.
[00:46:24.580 --> 00:46:25.580]   Yep.
[00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:28.580]   Yeah, the New York Times story said that Benchmark was pretty interesting.
[00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:32.580]   Benchmark was pretty instrumental in steering them towards a long term.
[00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:33.580]   Yeah.
[00:46:33.580 --> 00:46:34.580]   Don't take the money.
[00:46:34.580 --> 00:46:40.580]   Although I find it's completely hard to believe that a venture capitalist looking at that kind of exit would say,
[00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:41.580]   "No, just keep trying."
[00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:42.580]   How much did they put in?
[00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:44.580]   They put in like, what, 20 million or 13 million?
[00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:45.580]   Yeah, I'm going to pay the --
[00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:46.580]   Yeah, I'm going to pay the --
[00:46:46.580 --> 00:46:49.580]   The valuation was under a billion just last year at the beginning of this year.
[00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:50.580]   Yeah.
[00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:51.580]   So --
[00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:52.580]   They got to want -- they have to want to cash out there.
[00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:53.580]   Some --
[00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:54.580]   Triple your money.
[00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:57.580]   Somebody told these guys something that is doing them a disservice because they are --
[00:46:57.580 --> 00:47:00.580]   They are now overextended.
[00:47:00.580 --> 00:47:01.580]   Yeah.
[00:47:01.580 --> 00:47:03.580]   And it may not work out well.
[00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:06.580]   Candy Crush, how much is that worth?
[00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:12.580]   Apparently, they're thinking about an IPO King, the English company that makes Candy Crush release new numbers saying
[00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:17.580]   there are half a billion installs on Facebook and mobile devices,
[00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:20.580]   150 billion games to date.
[00:47:20.580 --> 00:47:22.580]   These are all good numbers.
[00:47:22.580 --> 00:47:24.580]   Do you -- Anybody play Candy Crush?
[00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:26.580]   I actually gave it up.
[00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:28.580]   I had -- I was playing on a -- It's an addiction.
[00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:34.580]   I got to, you know, into the '70s or '80s and I went cold candy turkey because I was spending --
[00:47:34.580 --> 00:47:35.580]   I was losing time.
[00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:38.580]   I mean, it was like a blackout where I was losing --
[00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:43.580]   Part of the success of this is that -- because I haven't played it.
[00:47:43.580 --> 00:47:46.580]   You die, but you can come back if you get your friends on Facebook.
[00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:48.580]   You can -- Yeah, you can -- Or you buy.
[00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:49.580]   Yeah, you can either buy -- You can spend money.
[00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:50.580]   You can spend money.
[00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:51.580]   You can buy up lives.
[00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:52.580]   You can socialize.
[00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:56.580]   But the -- the -- the catch is that once you burn through the five lives or whatever you have at the moment,
[00:47:56.580 --> 00:48:00.580]   then you have to -- if you don't either spend money or bring your friends in,
[00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:03.580]   you have to wait an hour or two hours or five hours.
[00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:04.580]   Which is -- That's a good thing.
[00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:06.580]   It's a good thing except -- You're addicted.
[00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:08.580]   You're losing the -- You're making it.
[00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:10.580]   You're a dopamine hit and you have to wait.
[00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:14.580]   Yeah, and that's what -- that's what drove me crazy because I realized I both -- I spent money and I also --
[00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:17.580]   I know what your friends -- I didn't -- I never hit up my friends.
[00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:18.580]   That was the line I threw up.
[00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:20.580]   I get that all the time on Facebook for everybody I know.
[00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:22.580]   I mean, that's the arm bill all over again.
[00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:26.580]   Those are distilling all of the mechanics that made Farmville a viral success world.
[00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:31.580]   It is a -- except that it has the mobile component and the genius of it is --
[00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:37.580]   is that unlike Farmville, which was just kind of a classic grinding game, you know, kind of similar to any sort of MMO or low-level MMO,
[00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:42.580]   because this is a match three game and you want to get to the next puzzle level and you want to have a chance to beat it,
[00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:47.580]   you know, you had that option to spend 99 cents and get your next, you know, pack of lives.
[00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:51.580]   And no, I won't lie. I beat all the levels available for iPhone.
[00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:56.580]   So I beat all of those and I'm at level I think like 471 or something.
[00:48:56.580 --> 00:48:57.580]   Yeah.
[00:48:57.580 --> 00:48:58.580]   Yeah.
[00:48:58.580 --> 00:49:00.580]   Let's not talk about how much money I've spent.
[00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:01.580]   It's a lot.
[00:49:01.580 --> 00:49:02.580]   Like 100.
[00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:03.580]   Gee.
[00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:04.580]   That's why I stopped.
[00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:10.580]   I was at level about 43 and I was on the subway and I saw a woman at level 371 and I said, "That's where I'm headed."
[00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:11.580]   It's never stopped.
[00:49:11.580 --> 00:49:17.580]   Well, according to King, the most difficult level is level 65, the licorice and chocolate level.
[00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:21.580]   And that's where people really get crushed, so to speak.
[00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:25.580]   Do you remember that kids? The licorice and chocolate level. What a level, huh?
[00:49:25.580 --> 00:49:33.580]   Well, I had this theory that it's like one of the like equalizing factors for all of us because on the subway, you know,
[00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:37.580]   Michael is right. Like everybody from all walks of life plays Candy Crush Saga.
[00:49:37.580 --> 00:49:40.580]   And that's actually what's kind of great about the game. Like you have people like your business guys.
[00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:45.580]   You have people who are maybe just like regular folks.
[00:49:45.580 --> 00:49:50.580]   You have like, you know, people with studs in their areas. You have like, you know, guys that would normally look kind of scary.
[00:49:50.580 --> 00:49:56.580]   Everybody is playing Candy Crush Saga. It's one of the equalizers, the great modern equalizers on the subway.
[00:49:56.580 --> 00:50:02.580]   Like we all are Candy Crush players. I mean, Bram Cohen, the guy that created a bit torrent, he plays Candy Crush all the time.
[00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:07.580]   And I know this because I get friend requests from him on Facebook like all the time.
[00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:12.580]   Like the number of people who would be shocked are Candy Crush players, which makes me feel slightly better about myself,
[00:50:12.580 --> 00:50:15.580]   not that I've spent so much money on it because like that's sort of stupid.
[00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:18.580]   Like how much is so much money? You can be honest with me.
[00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:20.580]   I think about $450.
[00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:28.580]   So I spent, I admit to have spent $300 on the Simpsons tap tap before it crashed and I was never able to play at $300.
[00:50:28.580 --> 00:50:36.580]   $300? $300 in donut. They owe me $1,400. $1,400. I'm sorry. But $450. If you think about, I mean, a game.
[00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:43.580]   Yeah, I know. I know. I know. And you know, the worst part, I don't even feel bad about it. I'm like, "Ah, whatever."
[00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:50.580]   No, you admitted that with Blithely. I would have, you know, it took me a long time to really face the fact that I'd spent $300 on it.
[00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:51.580]   I think they have A meetings for that.
[00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:53.580]   I need CCA.
[00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:59.580]   I was actually, you know, at first I was really mad at electronic arts because my, it got corrupted and they never fixed it.
[00:50:59.580 --> 00:51:02.580]   And then I was really relieved. It was like, "Thank God."
[00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:10.580]   Right. Well, that's what happened to me in Farmville. I didn't ever spend that much on Farmville, but it took me moving to get away from getting sucked into it.
[00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:16.580]   And it was Mashable's fault that I got addicted to Farmville. They made me review the stupid iPad app and I got sucked in.
[00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:23.580]   And then it became like a good stressful lever. And that's what Candy Crush is. It's just like I'll be in meetings or I'll be, you know, on a phone call or something.
[00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:31.580]   And it's just something to do. And I love puzzle games. So, no, I mean, I've come to terms with my addiction and it's ridiculous and insane and it's a lot of money.
[00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:36.580]   But at the same time, it's like, you know, it happens in criminal, which is what makes it so dangerous.
[00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:39.580]   It is cheap in this Mac, although I don't know if it's less harmful.
[00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:50.580]   There's people in the chat talk about the Star Trek next generation episode with Ashley Judd and Will Wheaton, the game where they have the addictive Google Glass that shoots the eyes.
[00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:51.580]   We're here. Yeah, it's happening.
[00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:53.580]   In fact, we're going to get the glasses even.
[00:51:53.580 --> 00:51:59.580]   I mean, how soon before Candy Crush is on your Google Glass, then you'll be walking into trees.
[00:51:59.580 --> 00:52:03.580]   Candy traction.
[00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:12.580]   God. All right. Let's take a break. Hey, you know, if you didn't, let's, let's, I want to do Tom first and then we'll find out what you missed if you missed any, uh, Twit this week.
[00:52:12.580 --> 00:52:15.580]   So Tom Merritt, what is coming up in the week ahead?
[00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:28.580]   Thanks, Leo. Here's a look at some of the things we'll be keeping an eye on on the week ahead on Tech News today. It all starts on Wednesday, quiet early part of the week, but November 20th, the Nexus 5 comes to T mobile for $450,
[00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:39.580]   in stores, Google shuts down its checkout product that's all wallet from here on out and the Google Chrome Dev Summit kicks off. It's a two day developer event in Mountain View.
[00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:52.580]   Thursday, November 21st is Pandora's earnings report. It's also the Xbox 360's birthday, which bears on Friday, November 22nd, which is the launch of the Xbox one in 13 markets.
[00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:59.580]   Also, the Lumia 2520 tablet and the Lumia 1520 phone become available.
[00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:06.580]   Until the week ahead, I tell you, Leo. Thank you, Tom Merritt. Now, if you missed anything on Twit, you missed a lot.
[00:53:06.580 --> 00:53:17.580]   Let's watch previously on Twit this week in Google. Did you see this? If I tap, I get the K for the breakfast. Oh, it makes me hungry for a kid. There's more.
[00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:26.580]   What? Cupcake, cupcake, and then look what happens. We'll ever get a real kickback bar from Candy Crush. I've got to get that bar.
[00:53:26.580 --> 00:53:33.580]   All about Android. Matthew Holson is building the All About Android podcast game. It's an endless runner. His premise isn't fair.
[00:53:33.580 --> 00:53:36.580]   Because if we're eating desserts, I'm clearly going to win.
[00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:43.580]   No house. Today, you'll know how to pick a podcast and camera and then how to get a Raspberry Pi fully contained in any of it.
[00:53:43.580 --> 00:53:48.580]   This is a traditional Western electric phone, right? With a dog with everything.
[00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:57.580]   And they take the guts out. And this is a cell phone. I put a sim in it from T-Mobile. In fact, I'm going to call it. I am not kidding. What are you doing out there?
[00:53:57.580 --> 00:54:00.580]   Well, the chicken look lonely.
[00:54:00.580 --> 00:54:04.580]   Twit. I got your touch surface right here.
[00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:08.580]   We got a priest, a chicken, and a phone.
[00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:10.580]   Is that a real chicken?
[00:54:10.580 --> 00:54:17.580]   No. Although in Petaluma, it could have been. There's chickens everywhere. You go down.
[00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:18.580]   You just run around?
[00:54:18.580 --> 00:54:25.580]   Yeah, there's a law in Petaluma that you cannot stop somebody from owning chickens. It's actually in the city ordinances.
[00:54:25.580 --> 00:54:26.580]   Wow.
[00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:29.580]   This was a chicken capital for a long time.
[00:54:29.580 --> 00:54:37.580]   Hey, you know, this is the anniversary of the Heidi game. Anybody that ring a bell for anybody, the Heidi game?
[00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:42.580]   Christina's too young. I'm surprised. I thought Jason might know this one.
[00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:52.580]   So on this day in 1968, Oakland Raiders were playing the New York Jets. The Raiders were down 32 to 29.
[00:54:52.580 --> 00:55:04.580]   Scored two touchdowns in the last minute, but nobody in the Eastern time zone saw it because NBC broke to go to a television movie of Heidi.
[00:55:04.580 --> 00:55:09.580]   Oh, right, right, right. And it was like the best play ever. Okay. I remember this.
[00:55:09.580 --> 00:55:13.580]   Yes. It was the Shirley Temple version of Heidi, right?
[00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:14.580]   Yes.
[00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:16.580]   Or no, no, no, no. I think it was a...
[00:55:16.580 --> 00:55:17.580]   I think it was...
[00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:19.580]   Well, not Shirley Temple because she was...
[00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:22.580]   Yeah, that was a really old one. I think it was like a TV movie version of Heidi.
[00:55:22.580 --> 00:55:23.580]   Okay. All right.
[00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:24.580]   Okay. All right.
[00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:30.580]   Jets lost to the Raiders 32-43, but a lot of people on these coasts didn't see it.
[00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:37.580]   And it was very, very famous. And it changed network television, I think, to some degree.
[00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:48.580]   Right. Right, right, right. Because at that point, they had kind of an agreement that if they could extend and, I guess, preempts programming rather when sports went longer.
[00:55:48.580 --> 00:55:49.580]   Yeah.
[00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:55.580]   Because before that, yeah, because they weren't going to preempt their prime time stuff, they were just going to go straight to Heidi.
[00:55:55.580 --> 00:55:56.580]   Yeah. Okay.
[00:55:56.580 --> 00:56:00.580]   So that's the beginning of the end of watching TV on a schedule. It was the beginning of the...
[00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:01.580]   1968?
[00:56:01.580 --> 00:56:04.580]   Well, it was early, but I think it was what...
[00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:06.580]   People remembered that and they thought, "I have to get..."
[00:56:06.580 --> 00:56:07.580]   There was a live television...
[00:56:07.580 --> 00:56:13.580]   Some day, somebody will invent a VCR and Tivo, and I'll never have to suffer like this again.
[00:56:13.580 --> 00:56:15.580]   Maybe I'm crazy.
[00:56:15.580 --> 00:56:21.580]   Hey, did you guys see all the hype? This is a Y-combinator startup called Coin.
[00:56:21.580 --> 00:56:25.580]   And everybody, but everybody wrote stories, the end of the wallets.
[00:56:25.580 --> 00:56:30.580]   And people were going into our chat room saying, "Have you seen Coin? It was the most type cool."
[00:56:30.580 --> 00:56:32.580]   You think it's cool?
[00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:33.580]   I think it's something that you look cool, yeah.
[00:56:33.580 --> 00:56:35.580]   I'm not sure it's fully practical.
[00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:38.580]   And then somebody in Europe, like everybody in Europe timed in and they're like...
[00:56:38.580 --> 00:56:39.580]   What work in Europe?
[00:56:39.580 --> 00:56:46.580]   None of this will work here because they use proximity sensors and not swipe anymore.
[00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:52.580]   The idea is it is a less than a millimeter thick card that you program.
[00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:57.580]   It has a dynamic magnetic strip, so you program in your credit card, you carry one card.
[00:56:57.580 --> 00:57:04.580]   And if you can convince a store that it is not some sort of thievery device,
[00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:10.580]   you can use it because when it swipes, it swipes whatever credit card you told it to swipe.
[00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:17.580]   I was amazed at how people jumped on this like it was the second coming of, you know...
[00:57:17.580 --> 00:57:18.580]   Yeah.
[00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:19.580]   Candy Crush Saga.
[00:57:19.580 --> 00:57:21.580]   It's a really cool concept.
[00:57:21.580 --> 00:57:23.580]   Which no one will ever use.
[00:57:23.580 --> 00:57:25.580]   Yeah, I mean, it's just impractical in a lot of...
[00:57:25.580 --> 00:57:29.580]   I bought something from Best Buy a couple days ago, covered from my iPad Mini.
[00:57:29.580 --> 00:57:33.580]   And I swipe my card on the terminal in front of me, and then the cashier said,
[00:57:33.580 --> 00:57:36.580]   "Okay, I just need to look at it and type in the last four digits."
[00:57:36.580 --> 00:57:37.580]   Right.
[00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:38.580]   So...
[00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:46.580]   I talked to the CEO of Coin before this came out, and he acknowledged that there's a number of both
[00:57:46.580 --> 00:57:50.580]   behavioral and security challenges that are going to have to be overcome.
[00:57:50.580 --> 00:57:53.580]   And of course, this whole Europe thing.
[00:57:53.580 --> 00:58:00.580]   But I mean, this is one of those situations where my new technology focus group of my wife
[00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:02.580]   says that she would buy this in a heartbeat.
[00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:03.580]   She would.
[00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:08.580]   She would, because she has a wallet that is stuffed full of loyalty cards and gift cards,
[00:58:08.580 --> 00:58:13.580]   and if she doesn't have the Barnes & Noble card, then how is she going to spend those $15 of Barnes & Noble credit?
[00:58:13.580 --> 00:58:17.580]   And all of that is can be coinified and simplified down to the...
[00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:21.580]   ...and be in theory, Google Wallet or Apple Passbook.
[00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:26.580]   Well, I think this is even more practical than those at the end of Google Wallet.
[00:58:26.580 --> 00:58:29.580]   Yeah, because at the very least you can swipe it.
[00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:32.580]   You can't be guaranteed that a terminal is going to work with the wallet.
[00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:37.580]   And for that credit that you never use off the gift card to be able to take those gift cards
[00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:41.580]   and virtualize them, and know that you're going to have them if you show up at that store,
[00:58:41.580 --> 00:58:42.580]   that's a selling point.
[00:58:42.580 --> 00:58:46.580]   And also for business travelers who have a personal and an expense card that they have to use,
[00:58:46.580 --> 00:58:47.580]   they have to use.
[00:58:47.580 --> 00:58:52.580]   Yeah, but on the interface of that thing, if you've got more than five or six things,
[00:58:52.580 --> 00:58:55.580]   and you're hitting the... I can just imagine it's like the channel changer, right?
[00:58:55.580 --> 00:58:56.580]   It's like you go past it.
[00:58:56.580 --> 00:58:58.580]   It's like, "Oh, shoot, I got to go all the way around again."
[00:58:58.580 --> 00:59:00.580]   You know, "I got to keep hitting the button.
[00:59:00.580 --> 00:59:03.580]   I can just see somebody standing at a terminal hitting that button."
[00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:04.580]   And they're like, "Oh, no, I just passed Target.
[00:59:04.580 --> 00:59:05.580]   Crap."
[00:59:05.580 --> 00:59:09.580]   The biggest issue is going to be that you've got to get everybody in the world to say,
[00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:10.580]   "Oh, I know what that is.
[00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:11.580]   That's a coin."
[00:59:11.580 --> 00:59:14.580]   And I'll accept that in lieu of an actual credit card.
[00:59:14.580 --> 00:59:18.080]   Yeah, I mean, the guy has been out there with his... I mean, not even the sleek one that looks
[00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:22.980]   like this, his prototype with wires and the breadboard hanging off it, and he's been able
[00:59:22.980 --> 00:59:23.980]   to use it.
[00:59:23.980 --> 00:59:24.980]   Why?
[00:59:24.980 --> 00:59:27.580]   Because retailers will accept what you hand them.
[00:59:27.580 --> 00:59:28.580]   Because it swipes.
[00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:29.580]   Because it swipes.
[00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:30.580]   I mean...
[00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:33.580]   Oh my God, if I were a hacker, I would just... Oh, this is great.
[00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:34.580]   It's great.
[00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:35.580]   I could swipe.
[00:59:35.580 --> 00:59:36.580]   I could swipe.
[00:59:36.580 --> 00:59:37.580]   I could swipe.
[00:59:37.580 --> 00:59:38.580]   I could give you anything you want to swipe.
[00:59:38.580 --> 00:59:39.580]   What do you want to swipe?
[00:59:39.580 --> 00:59:40.580]   It's crazy.
[00:59:40.580 --> 00:59:45.780]   The good thing that makes sense is if you lose it, it has a Bluetooth... It's tied to your
[00:59:45.780 --> 00:59:46.780]   phone via Bluetooth.
[00:59:46.780 --> 00:59:47.780]   Right.
[00:59:47.780 --> 00:59:48.980]   The phone will say, "Oh, you left your coin behind."
[00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:49.980]   Yeah.
[00:59:49.980 --> 00:59:50.980]   Right.
[00:59:50.980 --> 00:59:54.580]   I mean, yeah, I mean, and that's the thing is that you've got to have the two interfaces
[00:59:54.580 --> 00:59:55.580]   together.
[00:59:55.580 --> 00:59:59.340]   I think the reason that this has more potential than, say, Google Wallet did and some of the
[00:59:59.340 --> 01:00:02.580]   other things is because it still has that physical element.
[01:00:02.580 --> 01:00:07.780]   I think that the problem with NFC that people haven't realized in addition to the very,
[01:00:07.780 --> 01:00:12.180]   very difficult task of onboarding all of the point of sale systems in the world to using
[01:00:12.180 --> 01:00:16.380]   NFC, which is one challenge, is that people like the physical swiping nature.
[01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:19.180]   They like having that aspect there.
[01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:22.780]   And to them, it feels safer than tapping something, even if there's no difference.
[01:00:22.780 --> 01:00:23.780]   Right.
[01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:27.980]   And even if you can create as this shows, you can take a copy of all the data that's on
[01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:31.940]   a card and put it on another card and easily transfer that to something else.
[01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:33.780]   People like that physical experience.
[01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:38.580]   So I think that the genius of this is that it pairs those two worlds of having the management
[01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:41.980]   system of something like a Google Wallet or PayPal Wallet.
[01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:47.900]   I mean, ironically, the guy who was behind both of those things, Osama Bader is an investor
[01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:49.940]   or an advisor to this company.
[01:00:49.940 --> 01:00:50.940]   So that's actually-
[01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:55.700]   I just think they've got to have the best PR company ever because it all happened in
[01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:57.420]   one day.
[01:00:57.420 --> 01:00:59.180]   Everybody wrote about it.
[01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:03.820]   And whoever did the PR on this hired them.
[01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:04.820]   They were actually good.
[01:01:04.820 --> 01:01:06.820]   They blast everybody and they got to me too.
[01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:09.580]   And I looked at it and I was like, "Hmm, that's interesting."
[01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:11.500]   It left me completely cold.
[01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:15.580]   I can see the credit card companies go, "Yeah, nice idea, no."
[01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:17.580]   And that's all they have to do.
[01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:22.780]   Gardner in the chat room says this violates Visa's terms of service, basically.
[01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:26.780]   And it'll be a completely complete non-starter with anything.
[01:01:26.780 --> 01:01:29.860]   And don't give them 50 bucks.
[01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:31.100]   Don't give them 50 bucks.
[01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:33.100]   You're out 50 bucks.
[01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:34.100]   I agree.
[01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:37.260]   Well, I mean, if you do sponsor Kickstarter as a form of entertainment-
[01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:38.500]   It's not a Kickstarter though.
[01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:40.620]   It's their own website, which is even worse.
[01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:42.980]   It's cheaper than $450 of Candy Crush.
[01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:43.980]   But-
[01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:44.980]   Sorry.
[01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:47.580]   We're not going to give Christina a hard time.
[01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:51.780]   But the other thing about this one, to Jason's point, that you can only do eight cards on
[01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:52.780]   the card itself.
[01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:55.140]   You can load the rest of them on your phone and swap them on and off as you want.
[01:01:55.140 --> 01:01:58.140]   The button loop problem, I think they have licked.
[01:01:58.140 --> 01:02:02.980]   But they do have some security challenges with PCI, the payment card industry standard,
[01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:06.420]   which has some fairly strict controls about where you can store this data.
[01:02:06.420 --> 01:02:07.420]   So this is something-
[01:02:07.420 --> 01:02:08.420]   Fair, yeah.
[01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:10.620]   I mean, if it works, it's going to be very cool.
[01:02:10.620 --> 01:02:14.140]   There are many, many landmines that could potentially make it not work at all.
[01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:19.420]   Yeah, I mean, the promise of it is that this is the one card you need to carry.
[01:02:19.420 --> 01:02:23.500]   But there's so many pitfalls that- Only eight cards your wife's not going to be happy.
[01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:25.620]   But she can have the other 25 on her phone.
[01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:27.780]   And if she shows up at Strange Store, she can swap it in.
[01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:28.780]   Oh, she can with the phone.
[01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:29.780]   Yeah.
[01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:33.600]   Just- At the very best, the best thing this thing- this can hope for is to be an interim
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:37.460]   solution between the digital wallet and sort of where we are right now.
[01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:38.460]   Right?
[01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:39.940]   I mean- Of course, I thought that about Ariel, too.
[01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:45.420]   I thought, Ariel, this is like- There's no way this is- this is totally transitional.
[01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:47.420]   You know, the whole idea of an antenna.
[01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:52.460]   Well, no, the whole point of Ariel- No, the whole point of Ariel was to do exactly what
[01:02:52.460 --> 01:02:55.980]   they're going to do, which is to go to the Supreme Court and basically redefine what
[01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:57.260]   retransmission laws are.
[01:02:57.260 --> 01:03:01.300]   I mean, that was Ariel's cool- But who cares because it's going to all be on the Internet
[01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:02.300]   someday anyway, right?
[01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:03.300]   Right.
[01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:04.300]   Well, right.
[01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:05.300]   It will, but this kind of forces- Somebody, yeah.
[01:03:05.300 --> 01:03:07.100]   Somebody needs to break their model before.
[01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:10.180]   Oh, actually it takes- So Barry Diller's just trying to break the model so that he can
[01:03:10.180 --> 01:03:12.180]   swoop in and be of the ultimate campaign.
[01:03:12.180 --> 01:03:14.180]   Yeah, I mean, he's an Internet media mogul.
[01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:15.180]   It's got a A.C.
[01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:17.180]   Oh, so it's a Trojan horse.
[01:03:17.180 --> 01:03:19.180]   That's exactly it.
[01:03:19.180 --> 01:03:23.140]   And then of course, the irony is that one of the people- One of the people suing Ariel
[01:03:23.140 --> 01:03:27.660]   and by extension, Barry Diller is Fox, which Barry Diller found it.
[01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:32.340]   So it's really funny that the W Fox or whatever is one of their-
[01:03:32.340 --> 01:03:34.660]   It's Barry Diller's Up Yours is what it is.
[01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:38.620]   We can ask Barry Diller about this next week at the Bloomberg Business Summit.
[01:03:38.620 --> 01:03:39.620]   Awesome.
[01:03:39.620 --> 01:03:40.620]   Nicely done.
[01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:41.620]   Awesome.
[01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:42.900]   Where can I find out more about that, Mark Millian?
[01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:44.060]   BloombergLink.com.
[01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:45.060]   BloombergLink.com.
[01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:48.060]   We're going to find out more about that.
[01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:49.060]   All right.
[01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:50.060]   We'll see you in Chicago.
[01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:51.060]   Nice.
[01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:52.060]   November 20th.
[01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:58.060]   Microsoft, ladies and gentlemen, what a story.
[01:03:58.060 --> 01:03:59.460]   I don't even know where to begin.
[01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:04.980]   So there's a short list for CEO, one of whom, Stephen Elop, who was the guy left Microsoft
[01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:08.140]   to go run Nokia and is now being folded back into Microsoft.
[01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:11.020]   It's a Nokia acquisition succeeds.
[01:04:11.020 --> 01:04:15.740]   Apparently, he's thinks he's going to sell Xbox and Bing.
[01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:19.020]   Don't want those businesses.
[01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:32.060]   Another potential hire, an interim CEO, a number of people say, Ken Turner, if he's a CEO,
[01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:36.020]   because one of the rumors is Ken Turner does it for two years, and then Elop goes in.
[01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:41.140]   And a lot of people said, if Ken Turner ever becomes a CEO, we're leaving Microsoft forever.
[01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:45.980]   And then Microsoft, in some weird timing, announces, we're not going to use stack ranking
[01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:46.980]   anymore.
[01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:52.300]   So it was a very controversial employment and HR method that we talked about many times
[01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:55.660]   to work thinks is the single source of downfall.
[01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:57.700]   Yeah, 10 years too late.
[01:04:57.700 --> 01:04:58.700]   Yeah.
[01:04:58.700 --> 01:05:02.100]   And then bomber says, this is all this week.
[01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:03.340]   It's my fault.
[01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:04.860]   And that's why I'm leaving.
[01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:06.540]   Microsoft failed because of me.
[01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:10.020]   I don't know that he quite said that.
[01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:12.100]   This is from the Wall Street Journal interview.
[01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:13.100]   Yeah.
[01:05:13.100 --> 01:05:14.100]   Yeah.
[01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:16.940]   He basically said, you know, I'm trying to break a lot of patterns.
[01:05:16.940 --> 01:05:17.940]   And I'm a pattern.
[01:05:17.940 --> 01:05:19.540]   So I need to step aside.
[01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:20.540]   Which is right, actually.
[01:05:20.540 --> 01:05:24.540]   If you're going to reinvent a company, become a device and services company, you can't be
[01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:27.540]   under the guy who made them, you know, the Windows company.
[01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:33.340]   But the thing is, Ken Balmer went in and did exactly what he thought he was supposed
[01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:36.860]   to do, which was he's a sales guy.
[01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:38.260]   He's a marketing guy.
[01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:44.220]   And he went in and optimized the crap out of every one of their businesses.
[01:05:44.220 --> 01:05:46.500]   Every one of their businesses got more efficient.
[01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:49.460]   They got more profitable.
[01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:51.300]   And they made a ton of money.
[01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:54.300]   So he's been kind of saying for the past five years, like, what are people talking
[01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:55.300]   about?
[01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:56.300]   You know, we're making a ton of money.
[01:05:56.300 --> 01:05:58.140]   We're making more money than anybody.
[01:05:58.140 --> 01:06:01.420]   And what he forgot is they're a technology company.
[01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:04.260]   And the thing about being a technology company is the product that you're making all your
[01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:08.980]   money on today is not the product you're going to be making your money on in 10 years.
[01:06:08.980 --> 01:06:14.940]   And so, you know, their innovation, the innovation engine completely dried up over the past,
[01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:16.380]   you know, decade.
[01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:18.260]   And that's why they are there.
[01:06:18.260 --> 01:06:21.900]   But I will say on Bing, just to mention, you know, they talked about they're going to sell
[01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:25.900]   Bing, there is no way on Earth they will get rid of Bing.
[01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:32.180]   Even though it's not profitable, even though it's in big trouble, it gets them from a profit
[01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:33.480]   standpoint.
[01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:38.380]   It brings them so much data, so much valuable data on what users are doing and what users
[01:06:38.380 --> 01:06:43.980]   are, you know, interested in and all of that, that that is very much part of the future
[01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:45.580]   of their business.
[01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:49.180]   And who would buy Bing at a price of reselling it?
[01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:50.780]   I mean, most of my are might.
[01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:51.780]   I don't know.
[01:06:51.780 --> 01:06:52.780]   Maybe.
[01:06:52.780 --> 01:06:53.780]   I don't know.
[01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:54.780]   I don't know.
[01:06:54.780 --> 01:06:55.780]   I don't know.
[01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:56.780]   I don't know.
[01:06:56.780 --> 01:06:59.780]   Bloomberg is also talking about Alan Malawi.
[01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:00.780]   Yes.
[01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:01.780]   As one of the candidates.
[01:07:01.780 --> 01:07:06.660]   But it was the Bloomberg story that said that Eelop would, Alan Malawi is the CEO for
[01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:09.980]   it, by the way, and I'm one of the best CEOs, if not the best CEO in the country.
[01:07:09.980 --> 01:07:11.380]   But he's getting up there.
[01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:12.380]   He's about to retire.
[01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:16.380]   He's preparing to retire from Ford.
[01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:17.380]   Sixteen.
[01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:18.380]   He's so big.
[01:07:18.380 --> 01:07:20.980]   You know, he did Boeing and then turn them around and then turn Ford around.
[01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:26.380]   I mean, he is the consummate like, like he's right up there like that.
[01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:27.380]   He goes up.
[01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:31.180]   But he's a total Jack Welch.
[01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:35.780]   And I think that the part of me has to wonder if they keep, his name keeps getting
[01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:39.580]   mentioned almost because like Microsoft wants to be interested, not so much because he's
[01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:41.180]   really actually considering it.
[01:07:41.180 --> 01:07:45.300]   But they keep kind of dropping the name like, oh, well, maybe if this comes out enough,
[01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:49.900]   we can make something work because he would obviously be, I think, any company that wants
[01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:54.340]   to go in another direction's very first choice because he's an amazing, amazing business.
[01:07:54.340 --> 01:07:56.020]   I think he's the only guy they could hire.
[01:07:56.020 --> 01:07:58.580]   I don't think he's available, but I think he's the only guy they could hire that would
[01:07:58.580 --> 01:08:01.820]   get everybody to say, it's kind of like Marissa Meyer going to Yahoo.
[01:08:01.820 --> 01:08:05.580]   It would get everybody to sit up and say, well, maybe there's something going on.
[01:08:05.580 --> 01:08:06.580]   This might be something.
[01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:08.220]   It would be a five-year job.
[01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:11.500]   If he goes, I think it would be a five-year job.
[01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:13.940]   I think he would go in and they would innovate.
[01:08:13.940 --> 01:08:17.940]   They would do something product-wise because he is such a passionate--
[01:08:17.940 --> 01:08:19.940]   You don't like your 70 car.
[01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:20.940]   --you don't like your 70 car.
[01:08:20.940 --> 01:08:21.940]   You don't like your 70 car.
[01:08:21.940 --> 01:08:22.940]   You're 73.
[01:08:22.940 --> 01:08:23.940]   Yeah.
[01:08:23.940 --> 01:08:24.940]   There is a Microsoft car.
[01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:25.940]   MS Fiesta.
[01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:26.940]   And then he would groom somebody.
[01:08:26.940 --> 01:08:27.940]   Well, I mean, look at that.
[01:08:27.940 --> 01:08:28.940]   I mean, look at that.
[01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:32.380]   With Ford and Microsoft, you know, doing Sink, which has been one of Ford's most successful
[01:08:32.380 --> 01:08:33.380]   things.
[01:08:33.380 --> 01:08:38.180]   I mean, Sink is cited as one of the top reasons that people buy Ford cars.
[01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:42.820]   I mean, when they do their surveys, it's something like 60% or 75% of one of the main
[01:08:42.820 --> 01:08:46.140]   reasons that people are buying a Ford car is because of Sink.
[01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:47.540]   And it's been tremendously successful.
[01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:48.540]   And that was Microsoft.
[01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:52.860]   And I mean, I think that's kind of the saddest part about Microsoft is I think Jason was
[01:08:52.860 --> 01:08:53.860]   right.
[01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:56.340]   You know, like, Ballmer did everything that he thought he was going to do.
[01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:57.500]   He's the sales guy.
[01:08:57.500 --> 01:09:01.940]   And he worked on sales and selling his two big products, Office and Windows.
[01:09:01.940 --> 01:09:04.580]   And then just didn't keep his eye out for what was coming next.
[01:09:04.580 --> 01:09:08.020]   But behind the scenes, because it is this sprawling huge company, there have been a lot
[01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:12.180]   of people that have been doing really, really smart things and doing really amazing, innovative
[01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:16.820]   things that just hasn't had the chance to productize themselves.
[01:09:16.820 --> 01:09:19.220]   And you know, that's just the stuff we know about.
[01:09:19.220 --> 01:09:21.780]   Who knows about all the stuff that's maybe been happening that we haven't known anything
[01:09:21.780 --> 01:09:22.780]   about.
[01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:25.140]   And I mean, it's the last two.
[01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:26.140]   That's the sad part.
[01:09:26.140 --> 01:09:28.660]   A lot of you who let all those things all left, sadly.
[01:09:28.660 --> 01:09:29.660]   Absolutely.
[01:09:29.660 --> 01:09:33.540]   But they've still got, you know, I mean, I think as far as research goes, they're a company
[01:09:33.540 --> 01:09:37.420]   that does some of the best research and some of the most in depth stuff out of anybody out
[01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:38.420]   there.
[01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:40.780]   You know, they do research into all kinds of really interesting areas.
[01:09:40.780 --> 01:09:45.820]   And they have a social scientist, like a psychologist guy who works at Bing.
[01:09:45.820 --> 01:09:46.980]   His name is Matt.
[01:09:46.980 --> 01:09:50.780]   And I can't remember what his exact title is, but basically he studies like user behavior
[01:09:50.780 --> 01:09:52.940]   and all kinds of other things.
[01:09:52.940 --> 01:09:55.220]   But he's a fascinating guy.
[01:09:55.220 --> 01:09:58.260]   And like they're doing these really weird, interesting things.
[01:09:58.260 --> 01:10:00.380]   It would just be great to see if they could productize it.
[01:10:00.380 --> 01:10:02.420]   And I don't know.
[01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:06.460]   I think that the most important thing that happens whenever Microsoft, you know, chooses
[01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:10.660]   their next CEO is that they get away to a certain degree from the Windows branding because
[01:10:10.660 --> 01:10:11.660]   that's really holding them back.
[01:10:11.660 --> 01:10:14.980]   I mean, it's the most powerful brand, but it's also kind of the news around their next
[01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:15.980]   right.
[01:10:15.980 --> 01:10:16.980]   It's legacy.
[01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:17.980]   Yeah.
[01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:18.980]   It is.
[01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:19.980]   Yeah.
[01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:20.980]   It is.
[01:10:20.980 --> 01:10:21.980]   They need to make everything Xbox, you know, I mean, put a side that the additional, you
[01:10:21.980 --> 01:10:26.020]   know, excuse me, you're going to have to put that apology is put aside the BS around,
[01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:27.900]   you know, the Xbox one and the drama there.
[01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:28.900]   It is such a powerful brand.
[01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:33.220]   I mean, I would have called it the Xbox phone, you know, call it like Xbox eight, you know,
[01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:34.220]   point one or whatever.
[01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:38.820]   Like, like name everything Xbox because that is a very powerful brand.
[01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:40.140]   And then that's the most powerful brand.
[01:10:40.140 --> 01:10:41.140]   They have Xbox search.
[01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:45.260]   I mean, shoot, I would literally like rename the company Xbox.
[01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:47.260]   Maybe not go that far, but you know what I mean.
[01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:48.260]   But the Windows.
[01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:49.260]   Ex tablet.
[01:10:49.260 --> 01:10:52.300]   Ex tablet, you know, as a marriage of Foley.
[01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:55.420]   It's talked about this on our Windows weekly podcast.
[01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:57.140]   It's her opinion.
[01:10:57.140 --> 01:11:03.300]   And her sources tell her that in 2014 or actually probably 2015 for Windows nine, it will
[01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:08.060]   be very much a Windows phone ish experience, which is kind of Xbox.
[01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:11.580]   The Windows phone is the one success in that Windows sphere.
[01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:14.340]   Success by what measure?
[01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:16.540]   Not by sales or user interface.
[01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:17.540]   He's a code.
[01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:19.540]   It's actually a piece of code.
[01:11:19.540 --> 01:11:20.540]   It's nicely done.
[01:11:20.540 --> 01:11:21.540]   It works.
[01:11:21.540 --> 01:11:22.540]   It is nicely done.
[01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:23.540]   Yeah.
[01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:25.380]   And look, they're, I mean, they've managed to become number three.
[01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:29.100]   I mean, you know, you look at what Windows mobile was and it was terrible and they really
[01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:31.460]   they never that never was in the market.
[01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:33.340]   And they're doing very well in Europe.
[01:11:33.340 --> 01:11:36.500]   They're number one in a number of countries where the iPhone doesn't sell.
[01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:37.740]   I mean, I think they're doing all right.
[01:11:37.740 --> 01:11:39.460]   But that's what we can be like that.
[01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:41.380]   He seems so skeptical, Mark Millian.
[01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:44.580]   That 4% of the market is what, you know, what Balmer originally thought the iPhone might
[01:11:44.580 --> 01:11:45.660]   be able to carve out.
[01:11:45.660 --> 01:11:47.340]   So it's there's some iron either.
[01:11:47.340 --> 01:11:49.700]   Bimer missed that boat by a little bit.
[01:11:49.700 --> 01:11:50.700]   A little bit.
[01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:53.100]   Our show today brought to you by Shutterstock.com.
[01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:54.580]   A great place to go.
[01:11:54.580 --> 01:12:01.260]   If you have a blog or anything that you need images for, a great place for royalty free
[01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:07.980]   imagery, over 30 million high quality stock, 30 million high quality stock photos, illustrations,
[01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:10.340]   vectors and video clips.
[01:12:10.340 --> 01:12:11.340]   And I just love it.
[01:12:11.340 --> 01:12:16.020]   Whether it's for a website, a publication, an advertisement or any other type of project,
[01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:20.180]   many of the contributors, professional photographers and artists, Shutterstock reviews, each image
[01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:23.700]   carefully for content and quality before they added to the library.
[01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:29.140]   And still, they still get over 20,000 images added every single day.
[01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:30.140]   I love the pricing too.
[01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:33.140]   You can get image packs, but you can also do a subscription.
[01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:34.140]   That's what we do.
[01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:36.540]   And I'm going to tell you how you can really save on your subscription.
[01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:41.340]   We have the 25 images a day, a subscription, very useful for a publication.
[01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:44.020]   They also allow you to set up a free account.
[01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:48.300]   You don't have to give them a credit card at Shutterstock.com and create light boxes of
[01:12:48.300 --> 01:12:51.220]   images you want to save for later use.
[01:12:51.220 --> 01:12:55.980]   You're going to love the search tool that lets you search not only for objects, but adjectives,
[01:12:55.980 --> 01:12:59.100]   you know, happy clowns, sad clowns, that kind of thing.
[01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:00.860]   The light boxes are shareable.
[01:13:00.860 --> 01:13:02.860]   So you can share them to your team members.
[01:13:02.860 --> 01:13:07.820]   They have a great iPad app and they are truly multilingual, truly international, multilingual
[01:13:07.820 --> 01:13:12.980]   customer support in more than a dozen countries full time customer support throughout the week.

[01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:38.820]   Christina Warren is here from Mashable.
[01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:42.540]   We've got from the unofficial Apple web log.
[01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:46.500]   Christina, she called you her mentor, Mike Rose.
[01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:49.220]   We also have Mark Millian from Bloomberg Business Week.
[01:13:49.220 --> 01:13:54.220]   I'm not going to say it like Ruby Dog and Jason Heiner from Tech Republic.
[01:13:54.220 --> 01:13:56.220]   Nice one.
[01:13:56.220 --> 01:13:58.460]   Yeah, I spin.
[01:13:58.460 --> 01:14:00.460]   I spin that unexpected.
[01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:01.900]   Google, after what?
[01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:05.260]   Eight years wins the book scanning case.
[01:14:05.260 --> 01:14:08.060]   This is, was at the time a huge story.
[01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:12.980]   Google just decided we're just going to start scanning books and we'll worry about the rights
[01:14:12.980 --> 01:14:20.300]   later, of course, the publishing industry sued eight years ago, the authors guild sued.
[01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:28.860]   And in the US Circuit Court on Thursday morning, Judge Denny Chin said, "Hey, it's fair use
[01:14:28.860 --> 01:14:30.700]   because it's transformative.
[01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:33.740]   It doesn't harm the market for the original work."
[01:14:33.740 --> 01:14:38.940]   Google Books provides significant public benefits and essential research tool.
[01:14:38.940 --> 01:14:39.940]   Wow.
[01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:43.340]   I love the speed of the American legal system.
[01:14:43.340 --> 01:14:44.540]   Eight years it took.
[01:14:44.540 --> 01:14:47.020]   This is obviously the right answer.
[01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:48.020]   Yes.
[01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:51.780]   The authors guild will appeal to the decision so it's not over and I guess it could go to
[01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:54.100]   the Supreme Court at this point.
[01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:56.660]   But boy, is this the right answer?
[01:14:56.660 --> 01:15:02.140]   In fact, it was Judge Chin who said, "I don't think that he actually was very skeptical
[01:15:02.140 --> 01:15:03.140]   about this."
[01:15:03.140 --> 01:15:09.020]   Google had made a deal with the publishers and the authors guild and he said, "No, go
[01:15:09.020 --> 01:15:12.100]   back to the drawing board."
[01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:14.660]   But I think this is a really important decision.
[01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:17.220]   A lot of authors don't like it.
[01:15:17.220 --> 01:15:26.060]   Scott Tarot called Google Scanning an Indigody and a Money Grab who pays for the eight years
[01:15:26.060 --> 01:15:31.020]   of high priced litigation, the authors guild, I guess.
[01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:34.780]   Millions of dollars and years wasted.
[01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:37.220]   This is Marissa Mayer's big initiative.
[01:15:37.220 --> 01:15:38.220]   She was the one who loved this.
[01:15:38.220 --> 01:15:39.220]   Really?
[01:15:39.220 --> 01:15:40.220]   I didn't know that.
[01:15:40.220 --> 01:15:43.380]   Larry Page and Marissa went to his scanner and they were the first ones just scanning
[01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:44.380]   books by themselves.
[01:15:44.380 --> 01:15:45.380]   Let's see if it would work.
[01:15:45.380 --> 01:15:46.380]   Wow.
[01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:51.340]   It's just so great to be able to go online and search for the contents of a book.
[01:15:51.340 --> 01:15:55.220]   I understand the issue if you wrote that book that maybe you feel like somebody's stealing
[01:15:55.220 --> 01:15:58.860]   it, but nobody's going to read the book that way.
[01:15:58.860 --> 01:16:01.980]   I think it probably helped their case that they haven't really made a whole lot of money
[01:16:01.980 --> 01:16:07.900]   off of books because you can't really argue that they've just used this as a big profit
[01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:14.900]   center.
[01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:20.700]   If Google's goal, which they claimed is their goal, was to index all knowledge everywhere,
[01:16:20.700 --> 01:16:24.500]   getting the books in there is a big deal.
[01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:27.660]   Isn't this the future we wanted where everything is online and searchable?
[01:16:27.660 --> 01:16:28.980]   No, definitely.
[01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:34.820]   I think that just from a historical archive perspective, they had to stop doing what they
[01:16:34.820 --> 01:16:38.260]   were doing to a certain degree because of all the litigation.
[01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:44.100]   When you think about as a way to just have stuff saved and archive for historical purposes
[01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:46.620]   down the line, this is great.
[01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:52.220]   This is a huge opportunity to have books and magazines that would not be flagged as needing
[01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:55.580]   to be preserved for the future and you have them preserved.
[01:16:55.580 --> 01:16:56.580]   That's amazing.
[01:16:56.580 --> 01:16:59.140]   Or books that have been out of print for years that the authors aren't getting anything
[01:16:59.140 --> 01:17:00.140]   from anyway.
[01:17:00.140 --> 01:17:04.340]   The people could be able to drive and see information from those books.
[01:17:04.340 --> 01:17:09.300]   On the bottom line, I think with the book scanning thing and where the authors guild
[01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:18.140]   was misguided a bit, and the extent to which they pushed this was, I've actually bought
[01:17:18.140 --> 01:17:22.620]   more books because of Google books than I've not bought books.
[01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:28.660]   The fear was, if you can look it up on Google and you find that one passage, then you don't
[01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:29.780]   need to buy the book.
[01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:32.780]   You won't buy the book and they'll lose book sales.
[01:17:32.780 --> 01:17:39.180]   In fact, the opposite, I think, is true more often, which is I look something up on Google,
[01:17:39.180 --> 01:17:43.260]   I discover Google books points me to the fact that there's a passage about that in this
[01:17:43.260 --> 01:17:49.020]   book of which it'll give me a certain amount of that book to look at.
[01:17:49.020 --> 01:17:50.900]   In many cases, I'll decide, well, that's amazing.
[01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:53.220]   I knew nothing about this book.
[01:17:53.220 --> 01:17:59.100]   I'll then buy that book if it's something that I need for research or out of interest
[01:17:59.100 --> 01:18:00.580]   or whatever.
[01:18:00.580 --> 01:18:06.260]   It certainly caused me to buy more books than it caused me to not buy books because that
[01:18:06.260 --> 01:18:10.660]   title, that information was available online.
[01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:13.340]   It's kind of like a library, right?
[01:18:13.340 --> 01:18:18.500]   Do we have to pretend that the library must exist in a physical space and has to have
[01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:23.180]   all the volumes in a physical space and you have to go to the stacks and go through the
[01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:25.100]   dusty books and find it?
[01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:29.940]   Can't we just acknowledge the world has changed and now there is a better way?
[01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:33.260]   I have 13 books all out of print.
[01:18:33.260 --> 01:18:38.660]   I'm not worried about losing money because those out of print books would be scanned by
[01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:39.660]   Google.
[01:18:39.660 --> 01:18:42.700]   You might prefer that they scanned them.
[01:18:42.700 --> 01:18:43.700]   Hell yeah.
[01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:46.340]   Sorry, Scott Tarot, you've made plenty of money.
[01:18:46.340 --> 01:18:48.780]   This is not going to cost you a penny.
[01:18:48.780 --> 01:18:53.380]   The challenge with comparing them to a physical library is there's implicit scarcity in a
[01:18:53.380 --> 01:18:54.380]   physical library.
[01:18:54.380 --> 01:18:55.380]   There's only so many kinds of shelves.
[01:18:55.380 --> 01:18:58.740]   The shelves are only so large.
[01:18:58.740 --> 01:19:05.580]   You can't disrupt the market for those commercially viable books by having a library of infinite
[01:19:05.580 --> 01:19:06.580]   size.
[01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:12.260]   What Amazon and Google and the other ebook vendors are able to do is actually make a
[01:19:12.260 --> 01:19:17.420]   library that does not have a physical limit and that creates disruption.
[01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:20.100]   Whether it's going to be bad for the authors in the long run because they're losing revenue
[01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:24.940]   or good because of that discoverability that Jason was talking about is too soon to tell.
[01:19:24.940 --> 01:19:29.580]   But it's certainly not completely dismissable to say they don't have an issue.
[01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:30.580]   They have an issue.
[01:19:30.580 --> 01:19:31.580]   Yes, true.
[01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:34.180]   But it's the hard part.
[01:19:34.180 --> 01:19:38.340]   What you're exactly right, Mike, I think the problem is we're in between two models.
[01:19:38.340 --> 01:19:45.500]   I mean, having scarcity versus having infinite availability are completely different economic
[01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:52.500]   models and being in between them is the difficult place to be when the economics, especially
[01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:58.100]   your economics and your livelihood is based on the one that you're moving from.
[01:19:58.100 --> 01:20:02.140]   Yeah, you're tripping over the long tail and whacking your head on the kitchen counter.
[01:20:02.140 --> 01:20:03.140]   It's very unfortunate.
[01:20:03.140 --> 01:20:04.140]   Excellent.
[01:20:04.140 --> 01:20:05.140]   Excellent.
[01:20:05.140 --> 01:20:09.540]   Yeah, I don't want to diminish the feelings of, well, I do want to diminish the feelings
[01:20:09.540 --> 01:20:10.540]   of authors.
[01:20:10.540 --> 01:20:13.060]   You know what?
[01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:15.780]   The world is changing.
[01:20:15.780 --> 01:20:19.220]   In the benefits, and I think this is what Jai Jin was saying, the benefits to society
[01:20:19.220 --> 01:20:23.500]   far outweigh the somewhat minor concerns of authors.
[01:20:23.500 --> 01:20:27.020]   This is not going to cost authors sales.
[01:20:27.020 --> 01:20:32.260]   And the benefits to society are so huge here that I think that that was the right thing
[01:20:32.260 --> 01:20:33.260]   to say.
[01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:34.860]   Now, we'll see what happens on appeal.
[01:20:34.860 --> 01:20:38.380]   The author's guild plans has been many more millions of dollars and continue to fight
[01:20:38.380 --> 01:20:42.300]   this all the way up to the top.
[01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:44.700]   Another Google story, but not a victory.
[01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:51.540]   It turns out, I was surprised to read this, that despite the Apple Maps debacle, according
[01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:59.780]   to the Guardian and comm score, Apple iPhone users did not abandon Apple Maps and go to
[01:20:59.780 --> 01:21:01.140]   Google Maps in droves.
[01:21:01.140 --> 01:21:09.300]   And in fact, Google Maps, when it lost the iPhone, lost 23 million mobile users, 81 mobile
[01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:12.100]   users at its peak September last year.
[01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:17.300]   It lost 23 million of them who just said, "Yeah, Apple Maps is good enough.
[01:21:17.300 --> 01:21:18.300]   I'm not going to doubt."
[01:21:18.300 --> 01:21:22.260]   Of course, it took a while for Google to come out with a Google Maps for iOS.
[01:21:22.260 --> 01:21:23.820]   And there's still a big barrier to entry.
[01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:28.500]   I mean, a lot of people who aren't all that tech savvy don't know to go to the App Store
[01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:30.620]   to download the Google Maps version.
[01:21:30.620 --> 01:21:31.620]   I got maps.
[01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:32.620]   It says maps.
[01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:33.620]   I got maps.
[01:21:33.620 --> 01:21:36.580]   You click an address from an email or text message, it takes you to Apple Maps.
[01:21:36.580 --> 01:21:37.580]   The power of the default.
[01:21:37.580 --> 01:21:42.060]   I mean, this is why Microsoft got sued over IE being the default browser.
[01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:46.860]   There's incredible implicit, there's incredible power in having the thing that comes up when
[01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:47.860]   you press the button.
[01:21:47.860 --> 01:21:51.580]   I mean, what's interesting is that even now there are some deficiencies in Apple Maps
[01:21:51.580 --> 01:21:55.700]   that then reasons that people get driven to Google Maps for transit directions, for example.
[01:21:55.700 --> 01:22:00.220]   And that's part of why Apple bought and bark earlier this year is to start--
[01:22:00.220 --> 01:22:01.220]   And hop stop.
[01:22:01.220 --> 01:22:03.020]   --and hop stop, start pulling that capability back.
[01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:05.620]   Even for driving directions, it's still not there.
[01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:11.420]   Even in Apple's backyard in the Bay Area, it's essentially on insane routes.
[01:22:11.420 --> 01:22:16.380]   And I like the design better of app here than Google, but I still have to use Google in
[01:22:16.380 --> 01:22:18.540]   ways because Apple doesn't know where it's going.
[01:22:18.540 --> 01:22:23.700]   Well, there's a certain baseline of like for non-expert users of core capability and core
[01:22:23.700 --> 01:22:28.780]   functionality that once it's good enough, once it's an 80 or 90% solution, you will
[01:22:28.780 --> 01:22:34.020]   not motivate millions of iPhone users to go download a better Maps app because the one
[01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:36.820]   they have that comes with the phone is good enough.
[01:22:36.820 --> 01:22:42.380]   The trouble is that Maps is such a hard thing to do because these businesses are changing
[01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:43.380]   constantly.
[01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:47.740]   Even Apple will move their store a couple blocks and I'm sure they know when to change
[01:22:47.740 --> 01:22:49.860]   their maps on their store.
[01:22:49.860 --> 01:22:54.140]   But businesses go-- small businesses are cycling in and out.
[01:22:54.140 --> 01:22:55.820]   Google's a huge advantage there, right?
[01:22:55.820 --> 01:22:56.820]   Because of Google Places.
[01:22:56.820 --> 01:22:57.820]   They've got a sales force.
[01:22:57.820 --> 01:22:58.820]   Businesses, key core directories up to date.
[01:22:58.820 --> 01:23:02.740]   And they've got a sales force that's calling businesses to make sure that their business
[01:23:02.740 --> 01:23:03.740]   is selling.
[01:23:03.740 --> 01:23:04.740]   And way is too.
[01:23:04.740 --> 01:23:05.740]   I mean, the fact that Google bought ways is--
[01:23:05.740 --> 01:23:06.740]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:23:06.740 --> 01:23:07.740]   --ways and ways of--
[01:23:07.740 --> 01:23:08.740]   --ways and ways of--
[01:23:08.740 --> 01:23:10.380]   --that gets users updating the maps.
[01:23:10.380 --> 01:23:13.380]   That gets users not only updating the maps, updating the routing, updating the traffic,
[01:23:13.380 --> 01:23:14.380]   updating the construction.
[01:23:14.380 --> 01:23:15.380]   But the traffic is the huge thing.
[01:23:15.380 --> 01:23:16.580]   It's astonishing to watch ways--
[01:23:16.580 --> 01:23:17.580]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:23:17.580 --> 01:23:21.460]   --a heavily trafficked corridor on ways and just see the thousands of people that are
[01:23:21.460 --> 01:23:22.860]   participating in that conversation.
[01:23:22.860 --> 01:23:25.340]   So was it a mistake for Apple to say we can do maps?
[01:23:25.340 --> 01:23:27.860]   I mean, despite the fact that the tyranny--
[01:23:27.860 --> 01:23:28.860]   It was too powerful.
[01:23:28.860 --> 01:23:32.860]   --I think it's a mistake to not take it very seriously.
[01:23:32.860 --> 01:23:35.780]   I think they could have done-- I think they could have ponied up a little more money
[01:23:35.780 --> 01:23:36.780]   to get ways--
[01:23:36.780 --> 01:23:37.780]   They should have bought ways.
[01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:38.780]   --because they were a discussion to ways.
[01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:45.820]   And I think they've got this instilled culture of getting inexpensive deals and not overpaying
[01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:46.820]   for things.
[01:23:46.820 --> 01:23:52.820]   But when you're fighting in hot space, like navigation and napping, you need to pony
[01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:54.060]   up some serious money.
[01:23:54.060 --> 01:23:55.060]   Yeah.
[01:23:55.060 --> 01:23:57.540]   I think ways may have chosen Google, honestly.
[01:23:57.540 --> 01:23:59.100]   I don't think it was a money problem.
[01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:07.500]   I think Apple may have done whatever it could to get ways, but I think way too in Google.
[01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:15.420]   Well, I mean, possible factors that ways wanted to spend-- stay in Tel Aviv or at least
[01:24:15.420 --> 01:24:17.580]   keep their engineering resources there.
[01:24:17.580 --> 01:24:20.020]   And Apple is a very headquarter-centric company.
[01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:21.020]   That could have played into it.
[01:24:21.020 --> 01:24:23.660]   Although Apple now owns a bunch of Israeli country.
[01:24:23.660 --> 01:24:24.660]   It's a company buy.
[01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:25.660]   A lot of security companies.
[01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:26.660]   It's a bot one.
[01:24:26.660 --> 01:24:27.660]   Yeah.
[01:24:27.660 --> 01:24:28.660]   There are big in Israel, too.
[01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:29.660]   Everybody's big in Israel.
[01:24:29.660 --> 01:24:30.660]   I mean, all these companies.
[01:24:30.660 --> 01:24:31.660]   I'm big in Israel.
[01:24:31.660 --> 01:24:32.660]   We're all huge in Israel.
[01:24:32.660 --> 01:24:35.540]   I was just there a couple weeks ago in Tel Aviv.
[01:24:35.540 --> 01:24:36.540]   And it's--
[01:24:36.540 --> 01:24:37.540]   Were they talking about me?
[01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:38.540]   Oh, sorry.
[01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:39.540]   Yeah, they were--
[01:24:39.540 --> 01:24:40.740]   You know, we all report?
[01:24:40.740 --> 01:24:41.740]   It's awesome.
[01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:43.580]   No, it is amazing.
[01:24:43.580 --> 01:24:46.100]   The startup community in Israel is phenomenal.
[01:24:46.100 --> 01:24:47.100]   It's exciting.
[01:24:47.100 --> 01:24:52.140]   And American Western investors are just going nuts about kicking money into these companies
[01:24:52.140 --> 01:24:53.140]   now.
[01:24:53.140 --> 01:24:55.620]   And it's really a great time for the entrepreneurs over there.
[01:24:55.620 --> 01:25:00.540]   It is-- I wrote a big, long-form piece on Google-- on them trying to create the next Silicon
[01:25:00.540 --> 01:25:01.540]   Valley there.
[01:25:01.540 --> 01:25:06.820]   Actually, at Ben Gurion University, which is in-- which is south of Tel Aviv, but they
[01:25:06.820 --> 01:25:10.020]   are doing some pretty amazing, amazing things.
[01:25:10.020 --> 01:25:14.740]   It's in the north where they've got-- I mean, Tel Aviv itself, you know, just on Rothschild
[01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:15.740]   Boulevard.
[01:25:15.740 --> 01:25:16.740]   Yeah.
[01:25:16.740 --> 01:25:17.740]   It has a ton of companies.
[01:25:17.740 --> 01:25:21.140]   But in the north, you've got Microsoft and Google and everybody's got some presence
[01:25:21.140 --> 01:25:22.140]   up there.
[01:25:22.140 --> 01:25:23.140]   Yeah.
[01:25:23.140 --> 01:25:24.140]   And Haifa.
[01:25:24.140 --> 01:25:25.140]   It's big.
[01:25:25.140 --> 01:25:30.780]   Our show today brought to you by audible.com, Audible Platinum account awaiting you for free
[01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:32.180]   for the first 30 days.
[01:25:32.180 --> 01:25:34.260]   That means two books I've talked about audible before.
[01:25:34.260 --> 01:25:40.340]   I shouldn't have to tell you about the world's best audio bookstore, 150,000 titles strong.
[01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:45.260]   They've got classics and Hathaway reading the wonderful Wizard of Oz.
[01:25:45.260 --> 01:25:51.140]   They've got brand new novels, the John Grisham Sycamore Row, which just came out.
[01:25:51.140 --> 01:25:54.420]   They've got books about the technology industry.
[01:25:54.420 --> 01:26:02.420]   Must read books like Stephen Levy's In The Plex, How Google Thinks, the Amazon book-- Amazon
[01:26:02.420 --> 01:26:05.220]   story, which I'm really dying to read.
[01:26:05.220 --> 01:26:06.540]   What is the name of that?
[01:26:06.540 --> 01:26:08.340]   I really wanted the everything story.
[01:26:08.340 --> 01:26:09.340]   The everything story.
[01:26:09.340 --> 01:26:11.940]   Brad Stone's story about Amazon.
[01:26:11.940 --> 01:26:16.100]   We had Nick Bilton in here and his book, Hatching Twitter is on there too.
[01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:19.540]   It really is a great resource for people who want to follow the tech industry.
[01:26:19.540 --> 01:26:24.500]   Hatching Twitter is one of the best read books, by the way.
[01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:27.060]   The dramatic reading in that is phenomenal.
[01:26:27.060 --> 01:26:29.940]   One of the best that I've listened to in a long time.
[01:26:29.940 --> 01:26:32.180]   Here's a little excerpt from Hatching Twitter.
[01:26:32.180 --> 01:26:33.420]   Daniel May is reading.
[01:26:33.420 --> 01:26:38.540]   Pulling the door closed, a metal clicking sound reverberating through the room as he
[01:26:38.540 --> 01:26:44.820]   grabbed the black waste basket in the corner of his office, his hands now shaking and clammy.
[01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:46.100]   This was it.
[01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:51.500]   This last act as the CEO of Twitter would be throwing up into a garbage can.
[01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:57.820]   That's from the very beginning of Hatching Twitter and it gets-- it's what a story that
[01:26:57.820 --> 01:26:58.820]   is.
[01:26:58.820 --> 01:26:59.820]   So here's a deal.
[01:26:59.820 --> 01:27:03.060]   You can get that and the Amazon book or many other great books.
[01:27:03.060 --> 01:27:05.900]   I like to alternate fiction with nonfiction.
[01:27:05.900 --> 01:27:08.260]   It's kind of just the way I work.
[01:27:08.260 --> 01:27:11.940]   But if you've got two books for free, it's up to you.
[01:27:11.940 --> 01:27:16.940]   Visit audible.com/twit2.
[01:27:16.940 --> 01:27:21.380]   Not only will you get two books, but you'll also get the daily digest of the New York Times
[01:27:21.380 --> 01:27:25.780]   or the Wall Street Journal, your choice every single day, maybe five days a week.
[01:27:25.780 --> 01:27:28.580]   I guess there's not a Sunday Wall Street Journal.
[01:27:28.580 --> 01:27:33.300]   It is a fabulous deal and we're going to give it to you free for the first 30 days.
[01:27:33.300 --> 01:27:34.980]   Cancel it anytime.

[01:27:42.620 --> 01:27:46.300]   The offer is good in the US and Canada.
[01:27:46.300 --> 01:27:49.580]   But of course you can go to your local Audible store and take a look anyway.
[01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:50.900]   It's great.
[01:27:50.900 --> 01:27:51.900]   We just love it.
[01:27:51.900 --> 01:27:53.300]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:27:53.300 --> 01:27:58.580]   Devastating ending to that Niner's game.
[01:27:58.580 --> 01:28:01.140]   Oh man, I'm just dying here watching that.
[01:28:01.140 --> 01:28:03.500]   Doron's got the field goal quarter of the quarter.
[01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:04.500]   It's the quarter of my eye.
[01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:07.980]   It's not going to be a happy time at home.
[01:28:07.980 --> 01:28:11.220]   I'm just like that.
[01:28:11.220 --> 01:28:16.820]   Speaking of Google, the creator of Minecraft tweeted today, "Google managing to make YouTube
[01:28:16.820 --> 01:28:21.460]   comments worse is one of the most impressive feats in all human history."
[01:28:21.460 --> 01:28:22.460]   Aren't they worse now?
[01:28:22.460 --> 01:28:23.460]   So what Google did was you have to be...
[01:28:23.460 --> 01:28:24.460]   I don't think they're worse.
[01:28:24.460 --> 01:28:27.420]   I would think they'd be better because they're tied to you, right?
[01:28:27.420 --> 01:28:30.620]   So you can no longer comment anonymously on YouTube.
[01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:33.500]   You have to have a Google+ account and comment with your Google+ account.
[01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:36.060]   All the comments are people complaining about the new Google comments.
[01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:40.380]   People are pissed off about it, but I think the comments were full.
[01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:41.380]   They were so...
[01:28:41.380 --> 01:28:42.980]   It was so horrible on YouTube.
[01:28:42.980 --> 01:28:44.780]   There was no way to get any worse.
[01:28:44.780 --> 01:28:47.420]   I mean, there's no way they could have possibly gotten any worse.
[01:28:47.420 --> 01:28:48.660]   I mean, it was like a Turkish bath.
[01:28:48.660 --> 01:28:52.700]   You put one toe in the water and you feel dirty all over.
[01:28:52.700 --> 01:28:55.980]   It was terrible before.
[01:28:55.980 --> 01:28:58.620]   I never read the comments because of that, right?
[01:28:58.620 --> 01:29:00.180]   You don't want to read them.
[01:29:00.180 --> 01:29:02.740]   But people, YouTubers are very pissed off.
[01:29:02.740 --> 01:29:03.740]   Why are they so pissed off?
[01:29:03.740 --> 01:29:07.020]   Who wants to channel a YouTuber tonight?
[01:29:07.020 --> 01:29:08.020]   I can.
[01:29:08.020 --> 01:29:09.020]   We want to troll.
[01:29:09.020 --> 01:29:10.020]   We want to troll.
[01:29:10.020 --> 01:29:12.780]   Chad will do it because Chad, the host of This Week in YouTube, probably the best person
[01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:13.780]   to comment on this.
[01:29:13.780 --> 01:29:14.780]   Chad Johnson.
[01:29:14.780 --> 01:29:20.260]   So what happened is YouTube has finally done the thing that they've wanted to do, which
[01:29:20.260 --> 01:29:23.620]   was link Google+ profiles with YouTube accounts.
[01:29:23.620 --> 01:29:25.740]   And they delayed that for a long time.
[01:29:25.740 --> 01:29:29.620]   And even if you delay, you could still say, "No, I don't want to do it yet."
[01:29:29.620 --> 01:29:31.540]   But it got super annoying.
[01:29:31.540 --> 01:29:34.420]   They would message you every single day.
[01:29:34.420 --> 01:29:36.980]   Even if you had said, "No, stop bothering me."
[01:29:36.980 --> 01:29:38.420]   They would kept asking you.
[01:29:38.420 --> 01:29:45.060]   And so now that these two services are linked and you have to comment through Google+ basically.
[01:29:45.060 --> 01:29:50.420]   So basically on YouTube, you don't have to go to another service, but you're using another
[01:29:50.420 --> 01:29:52.380]   service to comment now.
[01:29:52.380 --> 01:29:54.380]   And so this will do a few different things.
[01:29:54.380 --> 01:30:00.300]   One, if you're making a comment and you forget to uncheck the little box that says post this
[01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:06.500]   to my Google+ profile, it will automatically post your comment to your profile.
[01:30:06.500 --> 01:30:10.940]   There are some features that it's added, which it added threaded conversations.
[01:30:10.940 --> 01:30:14.140]   So if you have a comment, people can respond.
[01:30:14.140 --> 01:30:17.020]   And you now have a much higher limit.
[01:30:17.020 --> 01:30:19.620]   You could only use like 240 characters before.
[01:30:19.620 --> 01:30:22.860]   And now you can go crazy with it.
[01:30:22.860 --> 01:30:29.060]   The things that people are upset about is that the algorithm for ranking the comments higher
[01:30:29.060 --> 01:30:30.620]   is completely changed.
[01:30:30.620 --> 01:30:36.700]   And so if you have a popular comment, it will always show up at the top for everyone, which
[01:30:36.700 --> 01:30:40.860]   means that if you get any famous person commenting, they're going to be at the top.
[01:30:40.860 --> 01:30:45.060]   And a lot of people feel like that's a form of censorship that no one, not everyone is
[01:30:45.060 --> 01:30:47.260]   on the same playing field anymore.
[01:30:47.260 --> 01:30:52.740]   And I can't understand being upset because you can't create an anonymous YouTube posting
[01:30:52.740 --> 01:30:54.340]   account as easily, right?
[01:30:54.340 --> 01:30:57.860]   But you have to create a page and has a name and you can still do it.
[01:30:57.860 --> 01:30:59.100]   And it's a profile.
[01:30:59.100 --> 01:31:00.700]   But it is associated with you.
[01:31:00.700 --> 01:31:02.180]   And that I can understand.
[01:31:02.180 --> 01:31:04.460]   But man, it fixed the comments.
[01:31:04.460 --> 01:31:05.460]   You got to look.
[01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:08.740]   I'm looking at the comments on Windows Weekly, admittedly far fewer.
[01:31:08.740 --> 01:31:11.700]   But every one of them is like a real comment.
[01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:14.540]   There's no fanboy saying, "Why ain't you on your point?"
[01:31:14.540 --> 01:31:15.860]   You know, "Oh!"
[01:31:15.860 --> 01:31:19.340]   Or you know, it's just there was so much garbage.
[01:31:19.340 --> 01:31:24.340]   So I mean, okay, yeah, maybe it's the ranking situation isn't as good.
[01:31:24.340 --> 01:31:29.340]   But to be honest, I think most people are upset because the transition was so weird.
[01:31:29.340 --> 01:31:30.700]   It was very abrupt.
[01:31:30.700 --> 01:31:32.420]   Two completely different systems.
[01:31:32.420 --> 01:31:33.620]   They can't talk to each other.
[01:31:33.620 --> 01:31:37.420]   So if you had had a comment, the reply button was just gone.
[01:31:37.420 --> 01:31:40.220]   There is no way to respond to those comments.
[01:31:40.220 --> 01:31:44.780]   Also if you have spam comments, they're sort of in this weird limbo where you can't remove
[01:31:44.780 --> 01:31:49.780]   them because they're on the old comment system and you don't have any moderation tools for
[01:31:49.780 --> 01:31:52.020]   that comment system anymore.
[01:31:52.020 --> 01:31:56.100]   So I feel like a lot of the hate is coming from the transition.
[01:31:56.100 --> 01:32:01.500]   Any video that's uploaded from now on will have the new comment system from the very
[01:32:01.500 --> 01:32:05.300]   beginning and I feel like it's a better system.
[01:32:05.300 --> 01:32:07.020]   So it is a better system.
[01:32:07.020 --> 01:32:11.100]   I just think had a great video that she put together that sort of summed this up.
[01:32:11.100 --> 01:32:12.580]   Chad did an awesome job too.
[01:32:12.580 --> 01:32:14.260]   But I think you guys even had her on this video.
[01:32:14.260 --> 01:32:15.260]   We did.
[01:32:15.260 --> 01:32:16.260]   We did.
[01:32:16.260 --> 01:32:18.900]   So this last Monday's episode we had, I just you know.
[01:32:18.900 --> 01:32:23.900]   She has a great video.
[01:32:23.900 --> 01:32:24.620]   It's like an eight minute video or six minute video or something that sums up the whole issue.
[01:32:24.620 --> 01:32:26.100]   The good and the bad too.
[01:32:26.100 --> 01:32:28.780]   So if you're interested in this, I think that's a that's an awesome place.
[01:32:28.780 --> 01:32:32.700]   Yeah, it's not the gold iPhone torque or the unicorn baby making.
[01:32:32.700 --> 01:32:34.940]   It's Google plus and YouTube merge, right?
[01:32:34.940 --> 01:32:38.500]   Yeah, I want to make sure I get the right one.
[01:32:38.500 --> 01:32:41.900]   And by the way, we don't mind a legal zoom ads since they're an advertiser on our network
[01:32:41.900 --> 01:32:42.900]   as well.
[01:32:42.900 --> 01:32:48.500]   So I just want you all to know in case you haven't heard the news, Google plus has merged
[01:32:48.500 --> 01:32:49.500]   with YouTube.
[01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:52.100]   So if you're trying to leave a comment right now and you can't, it's probably because
[01:32:52.100 --> 01:32:56.700]   you haven't linked up your Google plus account to your YouTube account, thus causing chaos.
[01:32:56.700 --> 01:33:03.180]   I feel like Google plus has also has enabled a censorship of certain words.
[01:33:03.180 --> 01:33:05.220]   So she mentioned that and you can do that.
[01:33:05.220 --> 01:33:06.220]   Yeah.
[01:33:06.220 --> 01:33:09.820]   So now you can white list or black list or basic blacklist certain words.
[01:33:09.820 --> 01:33:11.660]   And so you can't.
[01:33:11.660 --> 01:33:15.660]   So you know, she mentions, you know, if I don't want you to say blank on my on my channel.
[01:33:15.660 --> 01:33:16.660]   Yeah, she bleeps herself.
[01:33:16.660 --> 01:33:18.820]   Then you're not going to say blank on my channel.
[01:33:18.820 --> 01:33:22.260]   And you're noticing Leo that you're seeing stuff that people from your circle.
[01:33:22.260 --> 01:33:23.380]   These are people I follow.
[01:33:23.380 --> 01:33:25.580]   So they get, they get higher up.
[01:33:25.580 --> 01:33:26.580]   Exactly.
[01:33:26.580 --> 01:33:27.580]   Exactly.
[01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:29.380]   That's, I care more about the people I know's comments.
[01:33:29.380 --> 01:33:30.380]   I don't.
[01:33:30.380 --> 01:33:31.380]   I mean, the features are great.
[01:33:31.380 --> 01:33:33.940]   You can now like say a comment that's only shared with a circle.
[01:33:33.940 --> 01:33:37.860]   So if you want to say to your family, look at this guy is an idiot, right?
[01:33:37.860 --> 01:33:39.980]   Or whatever, it's not public.
[01:33:39.980 --> 01:33:46.380]   And Mike Elgin points out as a comment, by the way, to the I Justine video that it
[01:33:46.380 --> 01:33:50.540]   also shares stuff on Google plus when you comment on it.
[01:33:50.540 --> 01:33:54.900]   So if you don't turn that off, it's going to be a valuable promotional tool, right?
[01:33:54.900 --> 01:34:00.620]   I can say from talking to the other YouTubers, all of their view counts have risen because
[01:34:00.620 --> 01:34:04.300]   it's automatically shared socially when you comment on a video.
[01:34:04.300 --> 01:34:08.900]   See now, admittedly, Google plus isn't the most viral of social networks and has kind
[01:34:08.900 --> 01:34:11.020]   of a limited appeal.
[01:34:11.020 --> 01:34:15.900]   Feels to people like me, but probably less so to, you know, than say Facebook.
[01:34:15.900 --> 01:34:19.060]   Seriously, you know, evidently, I read it every single day.
[01:34:19.060 --> 01:34:21.860]   I don't post that much on it, but I do read it all the time.
[01:34:21.860 --> 01:34:23.860]   I like it because the quality is higher there.
[01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:25.060]   Tell you what it's no snapchat.
[01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:26.620]   There's no snapchat.
[01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:28.420]   I keep looking for those sexting.
[01:34:28.420 --> 01:34:29.500]   No, yeah.
[01:34:29.500 --> 01:34:31.300]   You should read the comments.
[01:34:31.300 --> 01:34:32.660]   I get on my Google plus page.
[01:34:32.660 --> 01:34:37.980]   Oh, well, and I know a number of women who've left Google plus because it is unfortunately
[01:34:37.980 --> 01:34:39.180]   welcome to the internet.
[01:34:39.180 --> 01:34:40.180]   That's very sad.
[01:34:40.180 --> 01:34:41.180]   Totally.
[01:34:41.180 --> 01:34:44.140]   And on behalf of men everywhere, I apologize.
[01:34:44.140 --> 01:34:45.620]   I don't know what second that.
[01:34:45.620 --> 01:34:46.620]   What do you do about that?
[01:34:46.620 --> 01:34:49.140]   I mean, it's not okay, guys.
[01:34:49.140 --> 01:34:50.140]   Knock it off.
[01:34:50.140 --> 01:34:51.140]   Get out of it.
[01:34:51.140 --> 01:34:52.140]   Crawl back into your hole.
[01:34:52.140 --> 01:34:53.140]   Go away.
[01:34:53.140 --> 01:34:56.900]   Well, Google plus is I think it's like if you look at the demographics, it's something
[01:34:56.900 --> 01:34:59.340]   like 40% engineers, 20%.
[01:34:59.340 --> 01:35:01.380]   That's why I like it.
[01:35:01.380 --> 01:35:03.220]   Smart professionals, 8%.
[01:35:03.220 --> 01:35:04.980]   It's all sort of people in the tech industry.
[01:35:04.980 --> 01:35:08.180]   And as we know, the tech industry is like 90% male.
[01:35:08.180 --> 01:35:12.980]   And so there's it definitely has there's a misogynistic strain to Google.
[01:35:12.980 --> 01:35:16.260]   Yeah, but that's not the creepers that are bothering Christina.
[01:35:16.260 --> 01:35:17.260]   I'm sure right?
[01:35:17.260 --> 01:35:18.260]   Christina.
[01:35:18.260 --> 01:35:20.500]   No, no, no, no, it will mean some of the market.
[01:35:20.500 --> 01:35:24.700]   But no, for the most part, it's just it's fine.
[01:35:24.700 --> 01:35:25.700]   I mean, it is what it is.
[01:35:25.700 --> 01:35:26.700]   It's just one of those things.
[01:35:26.700 --> 01:35:31.100]   You know, I don't let me honor you because to be a woman on the internet, public woman
[01:35:31.100 --> 01:35:33.220]   on the internet is such a brave thing to do.
[01:35:33.220 --> 01:35:35.380]   And you're so smart and you're so good.
[01:35:35.380 --> 01:35:38.260]   And you and you and you soldier on.
[01:35:38.260 --> 01:35:40.020]   I just don't know how you do it, frankly.
[01:35:40.020 --> 01:35:46.580]   I mean, I get a lot of nasty comments, but not anything like any woman gets, you know,
[01:35:46.580 --> 01:35:47.580]   on the internet.
[01:35:47.580 --> 01:35:48.580]   It's sad.
[01:35:48.580 --> 01:35:49.580]   You don't get a lot of women coming on to you on the internet?
[01:35:49.580 --> 01:35:51.580]   No, I don't know why I beg for it.
[01:35:51.580 --> 01:35:52.580]   I plead for it.
[01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:53.580]   It's baffling.
[01:35:53.580 --> 01:35:54.580]   Nothing.
[01:35:54.580 --> 01:35:55.580]   Nothing zero.
[01:35:55.580 --> 01:35:57.500]   No, I'm like, I'm just joking.
[01:35:57.500 --> 01:36:02.620]   Anyway, thank you for being brave, Christina.
[01:36:02.620 --> 01:36:04.420]   And super smart and good.
[01:36:04.420 --> 01:36:05.420]   Damn it.
[01:36:05.420 --> 01:36:06.420]   Here.
[01:36:06.420 --> 01:36:08.660]   Jeremy Hammond says my days of hacking are done.
[01:36:08.660 --> 01:36:09.900]   He's a little bit bitter about it.
[01:36:09.900 --> 01:36:17.660]   He's the anonymous hacker who hacked Strat 4 releasing millions of emails related to
[01:36:17.660 --> 01:36:20.460]   this private intelligence firm.
[01:36:20.460 --> 01:36:26.300]   He was sentenced on Friday to 10 years in jail plus three years supervised release.
[01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:32.180]   He did plead guilty to account of computer fraud and abuse.
[01:36:32.180 --> 01:36:39.220]   And he says the lengthy prison sentence was a vengeful, spiteful act designed to put a
[01:36:39.220 --> 01:36:42.500]   chill on politically motivated hacking.
[01:36:42.500 --> 01:36:49.140]   He also points out that at the same time as he's hacking Strat 4, he kept getting suggestions
[01:36:49.140 --> 01:36:59.300]   from another anonymous hacker named Sabu who we later found out was a FBI informant.
[01:36:59.300 --> 01:37:02.020]   And Sabu kept saying, oh, you got to hack this nation state.
[01:37:02.020 --> 01:37:04.580]   You got to hack this nation state.
[01:37:04.580 --> 01:37:08.260]   He even says, I never heard of Strat 4 until Sabu brought in another hacker who told me
[01:37:08.260 --> 01:37:09.260]   about it.
[01:37:09.260 --> 01:37:13.660]   Practically, I would have never done the Strat 4 hack without Sabu's involvement.
[01:37:13.660 --> 01:37:20.700]   And you got to wonder how much entrapment was involved by the FBI on and all of this.
[01:37:20.700 --> 01:37:23.660]   You know, they want to get these guys and make examples of them.
[01:37:23.660 --> 01:37:24.660]   They really do.
[01:37:24.660 --> 01:37:35.180]   I'm going to say the some of the Silk Road backstory on the hacking and just the insanity
[01:37:35.180 --> 01:37:40.620]   there is cray cray has replaced anonymous as the most interesting.
[01:37:40.620 --> 01:37:43.660]   Although the mega upload guy is pretty good too.
[01:37:43.660 --> 01:37:44.660]   Kim dot com.
[01:37:44.660 --> 01:37:45.660]   Kim dot com.
[01:37:45.660 --> 01:37:47.460]   The whole thing stuff was really fascinating.
[01:37:47.460 --> 01:37:48.460]   I'm not going to lie.
[01:37:48.460 --> 01:37:51.460]   Sabu's whole thing if reading this IRC logs.
[01:37:51.460 --> 01:37:52.460]   So cray.
[01:37:52.460 --> 01:37:54.380]   Tell us, tell us, don't keep it a secret.
[01:37:54.380 --> 01:37:55.380]   What, what?
[01:37:55.380 --> 01:37:56.380]   Tell me.
[01:37:56.380 --> 01:37:57.380]   I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:37:57.380 --> 01:38:02.260]   The Silk Road guy tried to have somebody killed who was extorting him and he's just
[01:38:02.260 --> 01:38:03.460]   doing some insane.
[01:38:03.460 --> 01:38:08.380]   He was just like, you know, supposedly some libertarian, just like kid, those, you know,
[01:38:08.380 --> 01:38:10.020]   that's the problem with hacker website.
[01:38:10.020 --> 01:38:12.140]   They're anarchist caught up in it.
[01:38:12.140 --> 01:38:16.460]   And you know, somebody was trying to extort him and he paid somebody in bitcoins to try
[01:38:16.460 --> 01:38:18.700]   to have this guy assassinated.
[01:38:18.700 --> 01:38:19.700]   Okay.
[01:38:19.700 --> 01:38:24.420]   So tip number one, if you're hiring a murderer, a Bitcoin is not the way to pay for it.
[01:38:24.420 --> 01:38:25.500]   Oh, better than cash.
[01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:27.620]   It's anonymous, but I think people want cash.
[01:38:27.620 --> 01:38:28.620]   Yeah.
[01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:30.180]   And I think you're probably not going to find a good hit man.
[01:38:30.180 --> 01:38:31.180]   Good hit man.
[01:38:31.180 --> 01:38:33.180]   It's not going to be very dirty.
[01:38:33.180 --> 01:38:36.860]   And I'm thinking he's probably going to need to be paid in cash and probably be better connected.
[01:38:36.860 --> 01:38:37.860]   I don't know.
[01:38:37.860 --> 01:38:39.220]   You give me some Bitcoin.
[01:38:39.220 --> 01:38:41.780]   Actually, with what what is Bitcoin up to now?
[01:38:41.780 --> 01:38:42.780]   460 something like that.
[01:38:42.780 --> 01:38:50.300]   I was going to say maybe savvy assassins savvy assassins take Bitcoin.
[01:38:50.300 --> 01:38:51.300]   It's current price.
[01:38:51.300 --> 01:38:52.300]   Whoa.
[01:38:52.300 --> 01:38:53.300]   And it's probably aren't on IRC.
[01:38:53.300 --> 01:38:54.300]   That's the whole thing.
[01:38:54.300 --> 01:38:55.300]   Right.
[01:38:55.300 --> 01:38:58.700]   527 dollars on Mount Gox for Bitcoin.
[01:38:58.700 --> 01:38:59.700]   Wow.
[01:38:59.700 --> 01:39:02.700]   Should have bonded a hundred.
[01:39:02.700 --> 01:39:07.420]   I have like six Bitcoins because we take Bitcoin donations.
[01:39:07.420 --> 01:39:09.580]   It's going up in value rapidly.
[01:39:09.580 --> 01:39:10.580]   Yeah.
[01:39:10.580 --> 01:39:11.900]   You know who has a lot of Bitcoin?
[01:39:11.900 --> 01:39:16.300]   Steve Gibson early in days of Bitcoin mining just thought he'd try his hand at it and got
[01:39:16.300 --> 01:39:19.420]   50 Bitcoins almost right away.
[01:39:19.420 --> 01:39:21.820]   He's sitting on 25 grand worth of Bitcoins.
[01:39:21.820 --> 01:39:23.900]   I've got like 10 or 11.
[01:39:23.900 --> 01:39:25.620]   I bought when was that like 14?
[01:39:25.620 --> 01:39:26.620]   Wow.
[01:39:26.620 --> 01:39:27.620]   That's a good investment.
[01:39:27.620 --> 01:39:29.780]   One of those pays for the candy for Shabbat.
[01:39:29.780 --> 01:39:30.780]   So you're.
[01:39:30.780 --> 01:39:31.780]   There you go.
[01:39:31.780 --> 01:39:34.380]   Those takes the whole candy crush bill.
[01:39:34.380 --> 01:39:35.380]   Exactly.
[01:39:35.380 --> 01:39:36.380]   No joke.
[01:39:36.380 --> 01:39:37.380]   See?
[01:39:37.380 --> 01:39:38.380]   See.
[01:39:38.380 --> 01:39:42.500]   I will cash one in and then I will feel better about see all race.
[01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:43.500]   See.
[01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:44.500]   Thank you.
[01:39:44.500 --> 01:39:45.500]   Man.
[01:39:45.500 --> 01:39:53.140]   Why did I become a Bitcoin miner in the early days?
[01:39:53.140 --> 01:39:54.140]   Anything else?
[01:39:54.140 --> 01:39:55.140]   I'm looking at stories here.
[01:39:55.140 --> 01:39:58.500]   Do you guys anything that you really excited to talk about here?
[01:39:58.500 --> 01:39:59.980]   Google Glass 2.0.
[01:39:59.980 --> 01:40:01.980]   Oh, woo woo.
[01:40:01.980 --> 01:40:02.980]   I can't wait.
[01:40:02.980 --> 01:40:09.700]   I did get some interesting information from somebody at Google that is, you know, I can't
[01:40:09.700 --> 01:40:11.780]   say, didn't want to speak on the record.
[01:40:11.780 --> 01:40:12.780]   Okay.
[01:40:12.780 --> 01:40:18.020]   They talked about the fact that on, you know, there's this little, there's a little screw
[01:40:18.020 --> 01:40:19.620]   on this thing.
[01:40:19.620 --> 01:40:20.620]   See right there.
[01:40:20.620 --> 01:40:22.180]   Are you wearing your glass right now?
[01:40:22.180 --> 01:40:23.180]   Oh, yeah.
[01:40:23.180 --> 01:40:24.180]   Okay.
[01:40:24.180 --> 01:40:25.180]   So you're a glass owner.
[01:40:25.180 --> 01:40:26.180]   You're a glass owner.
[01:40:26.180 --> 01:40:27.180]   Yeah.
[01:40:27.180 --> 01:40:28.180]   I was going to say you are a glass holder.
[01:40:28.180 --> 01:40:29.180]   Come on.
[01:40:29.180 --> 01:40:36.300]   That screw is going to come off and these new, you know, more fashionable glasses and with
[01:40:36.300 --> 01:40:40.380]   prescription lenses, there's going to have a kit that's going to take that screw off.
[01:40:40.380 --> 01:40:43.820]   And then the, the lenses will have something that connects to that thing.
[01:40:43.820 --> 01:40:47.140]   You see it'll, it'll, the whole band, the whole metal band will come off.
[01:40:47.140 --> 01:40:49.780]   So, so that metal band is not part of the glass.
[01:40:49.780 --> 01:40:50.780]   That's just a thing.
[01:40:50.780 --> 01:40:51.780]   No.
[01:40:51.780 --> 01:40:54.580]   And the glass, which is the little computer and battery here, detaches and you can put
[01:40:54.580 --> 01:40:56.220]   it on something much more attractive.
[01:40:56.220 --> 01:40:57.220]   Yeah.
[01:40:57.220 --> 01:40:58.220]   So there'll be a glass.
[01:40:58.220 --> 01:41:02.100]   It'll be something in the corner there that then will connect up to the glass and you'll
[01:41:02.100 --> 01:41:06.620]   be able to put it on, you know, the average people will be able to buy frames and, and
[01:41:06.620 --> 01:41:07.620]   put it on.
[01:41:07.620 --> 01:41:08.620]   I wouldn't go that far.
[01:41:08.620 --> 01:41:09.620]   Well, yeah.
[01:41:09.620 --> 01:41:10.620]   I mean, it's a conceptual.
[01:41:10.620 --> 01:41:11.620]   I'm serious.
[01:41:11.620 --> 01:41:15.860]   If Warby Parker makes a, makes a pair of, of glass compatible things, people might actually
[01:41:15.860 --> 01:41:16.860]   buy them.
[01:41:16.860 --> 01:41:18.860]   That was a rumor, but I don't think it is going to be Warby Parker.
[01:41:18.860 --> 01:41:19.860]   No, I know.
[01:41:19.860 --> 01:41:20.860]   I don't think it is.
[01:41:20.860 --> 01:41:23.220]   I think, I think, again, I think this is one that like the internet started.
[01:41:23.220 --> 01:41:26.420]   I think it would be all kind of started that rumor kind of like a wallie.
[01:41:26.420 --> 01:41:30.220]   And they should be working with Google because they're both hip and with it.
[01:41:30.220 --> 01:41:31.220]   Exactly.
[01:41:31.220 --> 01:41:33.220]   And hipsters are like, yes, we'll do it.
[01:41:33.220 --> 01:41:34.220]   I mean, but totally.
[01:41:34.220 --> 01:41:38.420]   I mean, you know, but no, I mean, they definitely need to work with somebody to make them not
[01:41:38.420 --> 01:41:39.420]   ugly.
[01:41:39.420 --> 01:41:41.380]   And there's going to be stereo glass.
[01:41:41.380 --> 01:41:43.820]   You'll be able to listen to your Google Play music and with two.
[01:41:43.820 --> 01:41:44.820]   Yeah.
[01:41:44.820 --> 01:41:45.820]   Yeah.
[01:41:45.820 --> 01:41:48.460]   They're going to have headphones instead of bone conduction.
[01:41:48.460 --> 01:41:49.460]   That's short.
[01:41:49.460 --> 01:41:50.460]   Well, they already have it.
[01:41:50.460 --> 01:41:52.860]   I mean, it's already comes with the, um, uh, oh, it does.
[01:41:52.860 --> 01:41:53.860]   Yeah.
[01:41:53.860 --> 01:41:56.700]   And you know, glass 2.0 comes with the earpiece.
[01:41:56.700 --> 01:41:58.700]   Have you already got your glass 2.0?
[01:41:58.700 --> 01:41:59.700]   Yeah.
[01:41:59.700 --> 01:42:02.860]   I just got it on Thursday.
[01:42:02.860 --> 01:42:06.860]   And so, you know, and it actually connects to the, to the USB, I thought it was, they
[01:42:06.860 --> 01:42:08.420]   put a new audio port, but it doesn't.
[01:42:08.420 --> 01:42:11.940]   It just connects to the, to the micro USB port.
[01:42:11.940 --> 01:42:16.660]   But so the stereo, which is coming out sort of in the near future as in like any time
[01:42:16.660 --> 01:42:18.980]   now, does the same thing.
[01:42:18.980 --> 01:42:20.460]   It just connects to that.
[01:42:20.460 --> 01:42:21.460]   That's how you can do it.
[01:42:21.460 --> 01:42:22.460]   So you get two of them.
[01:42:22.460 --> 01:42:23.460]   Yeah.
[01:42:23.460 --> 01:42:24.860]   And you have both you can have both.
[01:42:24.860 --> 01:42:28.740]   So, um, which is much better because, you know, the old one, you could barely hear it,
[01:42:28.740 --> 01:42:31.660]   especially if it was in a loud room or you're out on the street or that kind of thing.
[01:42:31.660 --> 01:42:32.660]   Because that was bone conduction.
[01:42:32.660 --> 01:42:33.660]   So it was just trying to get.
[01:42:33.660 --> 01:42:37.220]   Yeah, the bone conductor, which sounds like a cool idea, but it was really difficult.
[01:42:37.220 --> 01:42:41.140]   It didn't sound like a cool idea in 1973 when they were selling the bone foam collar
[01:42:41.140 --> 01:42:42.140]   that you remember that?
[01:42:42.140 --> 01:42:43.140]   Yeah.
[01:42:43.140 --> 01:42:45.900]   No, for skiing, it was never been a cool idea.
[01:42:45.900 --> 01:42:46.900]   But this supposedly.
[01:42:46.900 --> 01:42:50.540]   But I want to see the whole thing.
[01:42:50.540 --> 01:42:51.540]   Put it all on.
[01:42:51.540 --> 01:42:52.540]   Let's see it.
[01:42:52.540 --> 01:42:55.820]   This is what nerds do instead of saying take it off.
[01:42:55.820 --> 01:42:57.820]   They say, put it on.
[01:42:57.820 --> 01:42:58.820]   Put it on.
[01:42:58.820 --> 01:42:59.820]   Hairpiece.
[01:42:59.820 --> 01:43:00.820]   Yes.
[01:43:00.820 --> 01:43:02.620]   Uh, it's total dorks too.
[01:43:02.620 --> 01:43:03.620]   Here, like, take my good one.
[01:43:03.620 --> 01:43:04.620]   That looks so much better than.
[01:43:04.620 --> 01:43:05.620]   Don't fit the earpiece.
[01:43:05.620 --> 01:43:06.620]   Always in there.
[01:43:06.620 --> 01:43:07.620]   There you go.
[01:43:07.620 --> 01:43:08.620]   Yeah.
[01:43:08.620 --> 01:43:09.620]   Ooh.
[01:43:09.620 --> 01:43:10.620]   Is there a tube to go in your mouth?
[01:43:10.620 --> 01:43:11.620]   Ooh, wouldn't that be nice?
[01:43:11.620 --> 01:43:13.620]   Like something you could food to directly into.
[01:43:13.620 --> 01:43:15.300]   I hate having to hold my burrito.
[01:43:15.300 --> 01:43:17.420]   I just wanted like shot into my face.
[01:43:17.420 --> 01:43:20.700]   See, then we really are like Wally.
[01:43:20.700 --> 01:43:21.700]   You know, we're all.
[01:43:21.700 --> 01:43:23.460]   Totally Wally's Wally world.
[01:43:23.460 --> 01:43:24.460]   Totally.
[01:43:24.460 --> 01:43:25.460]   Yeah.
[01:43:25.460 --> 01:43:28.140]   Just feed me information into my cortex.
[01:43:28.140 --> 01:43:31.460]   But the real benefit, I mean, it still looks completely dorky, right?
[01:43:31.460 --> 01:43:34.740]   I was not a fan the first time around.
[01:43:34.740 --> 01:43:39.420]   What's different, and I really hadn't used it for three or four months.
[01:43:39.420 --> 01:43:43.260]   The difference this time around is there's a lot more you can do with it.
[01:43:43.260 --> 01:43:46.060]   My big, my big beef, the first time around was just, there wasn't a whole lot that thing
[01:43:46.060 --> 01:43:47.060]   could do.
[01:43:47.060 --> 01:43:50.340]   Now, software wise, they've added a lot.
[01:43:50.340 --> 01:43:53.140]   And then they've also opened it up to some.
[01:43:53.140 --> 01:43:55.540]   It's kind of like Twitter, the first, or sorry, the iPhone.
[01:43:55.540 --> 01:43:59.020]   The first time they had a few partners that they kind of let in and some developers,
[01:43:59.020 --> 01:44:00.020]   they could do some things.
[01:44:00.020 --> 01:44:05.860]   But next week they're having their big, they released the Glass SDK.
[01:44:05.860 --> 01:44:10.740]   And there's going to be probably a big explosion in third party apps because they're going
[01:44:10.740 --> 01:44:16.340]   to let you do a lot more with it if you're a developer than they were before.
[01:44:16.340 --> 01:44:22.340]   And when I was there, I went, actually went to the in San Francisco, their fitting area.
[01:44:22.340 --> 01:44:23.820]   And it was packed.
[01:44:23.820 --> 01:44:25.660]   I mean, it was completely packed.
[01:44:25.660 --> 01:44:27.340]   And I asked the guy, you know, is this normal?
[01:44:27.340 --> 01:44:33.180]   And they said, no, since they released 2.0, and then they gave all of the original Glass
[01:44:33.180 --> 01:44:39.380]   Explorers to invite to send everybody a couple of weeks ago, they said it's been massive
[01:44:39.380 --> 01:44:40.380]   since then.
[01:44:40.380 --> 01:44:42.420]   But it's still $1,500, right?
[01:44:42.420 --> 01:44:43.420]   It is still $1,500.
[01:44:43.420 --> 01:44:46.500]   So I'm not sure who's paying $1,500.
[01:44:46.500 --> 01:44:50.180]   I guess, you know, rich people in San Francisco that don't know, don't have enough things
[01:44:50.180 --> 01:44:51.180]   to do with their money.
[01:44:51.180 --> 01:44:52.180]   But--
[01:44:52.180 --> 01:44:56.060]   Oh, and people who think they're going to become internet famous, I'm not joking, you
[01:44:56.060 --> 01:44:59.940]   guys, like people who think this is the next wave of like SEO, like internet famous, like
[01:44:59.940 --> 01:45:01.940]   web marketing stuff, those people.
[01:45:01.940 --> 01:45:04.580]   So the Chiron shared women with Glass.tumbler.com.
[01:45:04.580 --> 01:45:09.980]   There's a few entry I scroll down, and there's Christina Warren at the bottom.
[01:45:09.980 --> 01:45:14.540]   So that is my tumbler that I created to a white newspaper tumbler.
[01:45:14.540 --> 01:45:19.220]   What's funny, actually, is that Bloomberg, whenever they run a story on women with Glass,
[01:45:19.220 --> 01:45:24.460]   or not Glass on Glass in general, for whatever reason, somehow that footage is in their B-roll
[01:45:24.460 --> 01:45:25.460]   for Glass.
[01:45:25.460 --> 01:45:29.460]   So like my tumbler shows up on Bloomberg any time they're talking about Google Glass.
[01:45:29.460 --> 01:45:30.460]   Nice.
[01:45:30.460 --> 01:45:31.460]   It's really weird.
[01:45:31.460 --> 01:45:32.940]   That's the only women they can find that have Glass on.
[01:45:32.940 --> 01:45:37.260]   Apparently, but it means just like in the B-roll for any discussions about Google Glass.
[01:45:37.260 --> 01:45:42.660]   Now that was just a came out of a Twitter conversation, but I need to update that.
[01:45:42.660 --> 01:45:46.860]   We'll need to get the new Google Glass, and we've still got the old pairs in the office.
[01:45:46.860 --> 01:45:48.340]   So we'll need to get a new picture.
[01:45:48.340 --> 01:45:50.700]   Finding new pictures to this blog must be a full-time job.
[01:45:50.700 --> 01:45:56.580]   There's only really, let's face it, 10 women with Glass three months ago.
[01:45:56.580 --> 01:45:57.580]   I know.
[01:45:57.580 --> 01:45:59.580]   I've been, as you can tell, I'm very involved.
[01:45:59.580 --> 01:46:00.580]   I'm very, yeah.
[01:46:00.580 --> 01:46:01.580]   I'm very hands-on.
[01:46:01.580 --> 01:46:06.260]   I'm totally, like everybody else, administrator.
[01:46:06.260 --> 01:46:08.860]   They're like 10 other administrators, but it's not just you.
[01:46:08.860 --> 01:46:10.620]   You can find another woman to put up there.
[01:46:10.620 --> 01:46:13.420]   Well, hey, you start with Sarah Jessica Parker.
[01:46:13.420 --> 01:46:16.820]   I mean, where else can Sarah go now?
[01:46:16.820 --> 01:46:17.820]   I sort of agree.
[01:46:17.820 --> 01:46:18.820]   Hey, she's on Twitter now.
[01:46:18.820 --> 01:46:19.900]   I'm so excited.
[01:46:19.900 --> 01:46:22.980]   She made Manolo Blomik a household word.
[01:46:22.980 --> 01:46:23.980]   She did.
[01:46:23.980 --> 01:46:24.980]   Are you absolutely?
[01:46:24.980 --> 01:46:25.980]   Yeah.
[01:46:25.980 --> 01:46:26.980]   SJP, she's now at SJP.
[01:46:26.980 --> 01:46:27.980]   She's now on Twitter.
[01:46:27.980 --> 01:46:28.980]   It's very cool.
[01:46:28.980 --> 01:46:29.980]   Wow.
[01:46:29.980 --> 01:46:30.980]   She has a three-letter Twitter handle.
[01:46:30.980 --> 01:46:32.740]   Well, she is Sarah Jessica Parker.
[01:46:32.740 --> 01:46:33.740]   That's true.
[01:46:33.740 --> 01:46:36.060]   Do you think they saved it for her?
[01:46:36.060 --> 01:46:37.060]   They probably--
[01:46:37.060 --> 01:46:38.060]   I'm sure they hooked that up.
[01:46:38.060 --> 01:46:40.060]   The person who had it before was somebody inactive.
[01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:42.860]   The person who had it before was assassinated by a bitcoin assassin.
[01:46:42.860 --> 01:46:47.740]   The rumor was that the New York Stock Exchange has been saving the letter-- what was it?
[01:46:47.740 --> 01:46:52.660]   The letter M for Microsoft just hoping they'd leave NASDAQ and come to Microsoft.
[01:46:52.660 --> 01:46:59.660]   Maybe this whole time, F. Williams and Dick Costolo were saving SJP just praying someday
[01:46:59.660 --> 01:47:02.540]   Sarah Jessica Parker would come and post pictures of--
[01:47:02.540 --> 01:47:03.540]   Girl cheese.
[01:47:03.540 --> 01:47:04.540]   Girl cheese sandwiches.
[01:47:04.540 --> 01:47:05.540]   Girl cheese sandwiches.
[01:47:05.540 --> 01:47:09.460]   She obviously got what Twitter is all about right away.
[01:47:09.460 --> 01:47:10.460]   Salad.
[01:47:10.460 --> 01:47:13.060]   That's a good looking phone.
[01:47:13.060 --> 01:47:17.060]   Great girl cheese sandwiches and the Empire State Building.
[01:47:17.060 --> 01:47:18.980]   Those were all taken with glass, I'm sure.
[01:47:18.980 --> 01:47:21.180]   Oh, I bet they-- well, this one might have been.
[01:47:21.180 --> 01:47:22.180]   Probably not.
[01:47:22.180 --> 01:47:23.180]   Probably they're taken looking at iPhone.
[01:47:23.180 --> 01:47:24.180]   I'm sure.
[01:47:24.180 --> 01:47:25.180]   She uses Twitter for Android.
[01:47:25.180 --> 01:47:26.180]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:47:26.180 --> 01:47:27.180]   Oh, nice.
[01:47:27.180 --> 01:47:29.180]   Which I actually did think was interesting.
[01:47:29.180 --> 01:47:30.980]   I would have pegged her for an iPhone person.
[01:47:30.980 --> 01:47:31.980]   But she has an iPhone too.
[01:47:31.980 --> 01:47:32.980]   She has an iPhone too.
[01:47:32.980 --> 01:47:34.780]   Here's a picture of a penny.
[01:47:34.780 --> 01:47:37.780]   She found it on the 14th Street subway platform.
[01:47:37.780 --> 01:47:40.300]   So this is high class entertainment.
[01:47:40.300 --> 01:47:41.300]   Wow.
[01:47:41.300 --> 01:47:42.300]   Completely.
[01:47:42.300 --> 01:47:46.340]   No, she's obviously was forced to sign up to promote her AOL thing on the New York
[01:47:46.340 --> 01:47:47.340]   ballet.
[01:47:47.340 --> 01:47:49.340]   And yeah, but anyway, she's on.
[01:47:49.340 --> 01:47:50.340]   Good for her.
[01:47:50.340 --> 01:47:53.580]   And that's going to have a million followers more than me in three days.
[01:47:53.580 --> 01:47:57.420]   I should say in three days, she's starting to park her for one.
[01:47:57.420 --> 01:47:59.260]   You still remember when you were number one?
[01:47:59.260 --> 01:48:00.260]   I'm still bitter.
[01:48:00.260 --> 01:48:04.700]   I used to be number one many, many years ago.
[01:48:04.700 --> 01:48:06.620]   Speaking of AOL, I'm a little worried about this.
[01:48:06.620 --> 01:48:16.100]   Roku and AOL have done a deal to bring live TV news services to Roku.
[01:48:16.100 --> 01:48:19.580]   You know, this has probably has something to do with a David Pogue effort.
[01:48:19.580 --> 01:48:21.220]   Oh, no, he's a young.
[01:48:21.220 --> 01:48:23.700]   But AOL does do a lot of TV, right?
[01:48:23.700 --> 01:48:24.700]   Yeah.
[01:48:24.700 --> 01:48:26.900]   And when they have Puff Post live and that sort of stuff.
[01:48:26.900 --> 01:48:29.260]   So that's, I mean, I think that's probably the...
[01:48:29.260 --> 01:48:34.340]   They say they're going to do Wall Street Journal Associated Press Reuters, BBC News
[01:48:34.340 --> 01:48:39.780]   Huff Post live, Newsy, e, CNET, Engadget, ET, Story Hunter and Global Post.
[01:48:39.780 --> 01:48:42.420]   I'm terrified.
[01:48:42.420 --> 01:48:45.460]   Why would you even watch Twitch when you can watch all of that?
[01:48:45.460 --> 01:48:46.460]   You're not terrified.
[01:48:46.460 --> 01:48:48.460]   No, I'm not at all.
[01:48:48.460 --> 01:48:50.780]   Not at all.
[01:48:50.780 --> 01:48:52.300]   I've got Jason Heiner.
[01:48:52.300 --> 01:48:53.940]   I've got Christina Warren.
[01:48:53.940 --> 01:48:55.180]   I don't need those guys.
[01:48:55.180 --> 01:48:56.420]   I've got Mark Millian.
[01:48:56.420 --> 01:48:59.780]   I've got Michael Rose and I've got Stamps.com.
[01:48:59.780 --> 01:49:03.420]   I never have to go to the post office ever again.
[01:49:03.420 --> 01:49:04.420]   Thanks to Stamps.
[01:49:04.420 --> 01:49:05.420]   What a transition.
[01:49:05.420 --> 01:49:06.420]   Stamps.com.
[01:49:06.420 --> 01:49:08.060]   God, you are good.
[01:49:08.060 --> 01:49:09.060]   Ah.
[01:49:09.060 --> 01:49:11.740]   Just slip it right in there.
[01:49:11.740 --> 01:49:15.340]   Stamps.com is actually a really great solution for anybody who's still...
[01:49:15.340 --> 01:49:18.140]   And this is the time of year you don't want to go to the post office.
[01:49:18.140 --> 01:49:23.420]   Finding parking, all the people there who are mailing packages to Aunt May and putting
[01:49:23.420 --> 01:49:25.460]   their Christmas card list on there.
[01:49:25.460 --> 01:49:32.940]   Stamps.com has printed, get this, in one year, $1 billion in postage.
[01:49:32.940 --> 01:49:33.940]   You don't need a postage meter.
[01:49:33.940 --> 01:49:39.500]   You just need your computer, your printer, and it'll do international mail for you.
[01:49:39.500 --> 01:49:41.500]   Fill out all the forms so you don't have to.
[01:49:41.500 --> 01:49:44.620]   In fact, anything you could do at the post office, Stamps.com will do for you faster,
[01:49:44.620 --> 01:49:45.620]   better, easier.
[01:49:45.620 --> 01:49:47.820]   They even have discounts you can't get at the post office.
[01:49:47.820 --> 01:49:48.820]   I love it.
[01:49:48.820 --> 01:49:52.580]   They've got a button in the interface that says, "Tell the mail carrier to come.
[01:49:52.580 --> 01:49:53.580]   I've got something."
[01:49:53.580 --> 01:49:57.140]   I mean, this is one thing the post office does really well.
[01:49:57.140 --> 01:49:59.380]   Six days a week, they come to your office, right?
[01:49:59.380 --> 01:50:04.060]   Well, even if that's not enough, you can still push the button and they'll come again.
[01:50:04.060 --> 01:50:05.060]   I love it.
[01:50:05.060 --> 01:50:06.060]   Stamps.com.
[01:50:06.060 --> 01:50:11.740]   You can save up to 63% on Priority Mail, Express shipments up to 40% on package insurance,
[01:50:11.740 --> 01:50:13.500]   so it will save you money.
[01:50:13.500 --> 01:50:17.380]   If you sell items on eBay or Amazon or Etsy, it's great.
[01:50:17.380 --> 01:50:23.700]   It'll take the information from your web store and populate the package mailing label.
[01:50:23.700 --> 01:50:29.300]   It'll print right on envelopes if you have to send out billings or invoices or brochures
[01:50:29.300 --> 01:50:31.700]   with your company's logo, return address and everything.
[01:50:31.700 --> 01:50:33.900]   I love stamps.com.
[01:50:33.900 --> 01:50:38.900]   Small business and stamps.com, hand in hand, my friends.
[01:50:38.900 --> 01:50:40.540]   That's why I want you to visit stamps.com.
[01:50:40.540 --> 01:50:43.740]   Now, you may say that $80 value looks like a great deal right on the front.
[01:50:43.740 --> 01:50:44.740]   I'm just going to take that.
[01:50:44.740 --> 01:50:45.740]   No, no.
[01:50:45.740 --> 01:50:46.740]   Shop around a little bit.
[01:50:46.740 --> 01:50:49.140]   Click the radio microphone at the top of the homepage.
[01:50:49.140 --> 01:50:51.700]   Enter in our offer code TWIT.
[01:50:51.700 --> 01:50:53.620]   You're going to get $110 bonus value.
[01:50:53.620 --> 01:50:55.820]   This is something special just for Twit listeners.
[01:50:55.820 --> 01:51:00.980]   $55 in free postage you can use over the life of your account.
[01:51:00.980 --> 01:51:02.700]   You've got a free digital scale.
[01:51:02.700 --> 01:51:05.500]   You just pay the shipping and handling about $5 on that.
[01:51:05.500 --> 01:51:07.420]   $5 supplies kit, stamps.
[01:51:07.420 --> 01:51:10.220]   You can print right on the stamps.
[01:51:10.220 --> 01:51:13.580]   Of course, months trial of stamps.com.
[01:51:13.580 --> 01:51:14.580]   Stamps.com.
[01:51:14.580 --> 01:51:16.020]   Use our offer code TWIT.
[01:51:16.020 --> 01:51:18.020]   Click that microphone in the corner.
[01:51:18.020 --> 01:51:20.020]   You will love it.
[01:51:20.020 --> 01:51:21.020]   I do.
[01:51:21.020 --> 01:51:27.020]   Wolfram has announced a programming language that incorporates the mathematical stuff and
[01:51:27.020 --> 01:51:28.580]   the Wolfram alpha stuff.
[01:51:28.580 --> 01:51:34.580]   You can write high level programs that model the world.
[01:51:34.580 --> 01:51:39.620]   There's no one in the text viewer right now more like a cartoon supervillain than Stephen
[01:51:39.620 --> 01:51:40.620]   Wolf.
[01:51:40.620 --> 01:51:45.660]   He's apparently one of the most altruistic sort of...
[01:51:45.660 --> 01:51:46.660]   I love him.
[01:51:46.660 --> 01:51:51.660]   He has super smart.
[01:51:51.660 --> 01:51:53.420]   This is a really interesting idea.
[01:51:53.420 --> 01:51:55.020]   It's a very high level language.
[01:51:55.020 --> 01:52:00.020]   They've already been using it inside Mathematica for 25 years or something similar.
[01:52:00.020 --> 01:52:06.300]   Imagine that you could write a language but pull information together.
[01:52:06.300 --> 01:52:10.100]   They wanted to do a programming cloud which means you could deploy and launch apps just
[01:52:10.100 --> 01:52:17.580]   like you can on Amazon, web services right now or Google call their thing.
[01:52:17.580 --> 01:52:18.580]   App Engine.
[01:52:18.580 --> 01:52:19.580]   App Engine.
[01:52:19.580 --> 01:52:20.580]   App Engine.
[01:52:20.580 --> 01:52:24.660]   But you could also run it standalone.
[01:52:24.660 --> 01:52:26.180]   I don't know what it is.
[01:52:26.180 --> 01:52:29.460]   I don't know what it means but I certainly will be very interested in it.
[01:52:29.460 --> 01:52:30.460]   I love it.
[01:52:30.460 --> 01:52:33.660]   The future of programming is not code now.
[01:52:33.660 --> 01:52:42.460]   The future of programming is that stuff fades to the background and future of programming
[01:52:42.460 --> 01:52:49.820]   becomes about creativity and social science and understanding users.
[01:52:49.820 --> 01:52:57.540]   And so in 2020 I see a massive layoffs of coders who know computers better than people.
[01:52:57.540 --> 01:52:59.180]   You got to know people too.
[01:52:59.180 --> 01:53:00.180]   You can't make the transition.
[01:53:00.180 --> 01:53:01.180]   You got to know people.
[01:53:01.180 --> 01:53:03.860]   I mean social scientists are the future of code.
[01:53:03.860 --> 01:53:04.940]   Look at Candy Crush.
[01:53:04.940 --> 01:53:07.220]   That's not hard software to write.
[01:53:07.220 --> 01:53:08.220]   Yeah.
[01:53:08.220 --> 01:53:09.220]   No.
[01:53:09.220 --> 01:53:13.220]   No, it's all about game mechanics and behavioral analysis and game-ifying, like figuring out
[01:53:13.220 --> 01:53:17.500]   like how you can get people to spend that extra dollar or ask their friend for something
[01:53:17.500 --> 01:53:21.220]   that's going to end up leading to another person to spend a dollar.
[01:53:21.220 --> 01:53:24.380]   I mean, just last thing I'll say on Candy Crush, I would love to see what their conversion
[01:53:24.380 --> 01:53:30.700]   rate is from a user who has never spent a dime to someone who's spent at least a dollar
[01:53:30.700 --> 01:53:32.700]   or whatever, because I bet it's pretty high.
[01:53:32.700 --> 01:53:37.380]   And that's where I think that that's why they are so profitable and why they've made
[01:53:37.380 --> 01:53:38.900]   so much freaking money.
[01:53:38.900 --> 01:53:44.140]   Russian cosmonauts, occasionally they infect the International Space Station with malware.
[01:53:44.140 --> 01:53:45.140]   It happens.
[01:53:45.140 --> 01:53:46.700]   They bring USB keys up.
[01:53:46.700 --> 01:53:52.500]   The funny thing is it's the malware that we wrote, or some government, our government,
[01:53:52.500 --> 01:53:59.020]   maybe the Israeli government, wrote two, Stuxnet to take down the Iranian nuclear enrichment
[01:53:59.020 --> 01:54:00.020]   facilities.
[01:54:00.020 --> 01:54:02.020]   And Soviet part of space station.
[01:54:02.020 --> 01:54:03.020]   Oops.
[01:54:03.020 --> 01:54:04.020]   You.
[01:54:04.020 --> 01:54:05.020]   Whoops.
[01:54:05.020 --> 01:54:06.020]   Whoops.
[01:54:06.020 --> 01:54:08.580]   I'm sure they have McAfee in space.
[01:54:08.580 --> 01:54:09.580]   Yeah.
[01:54:09.580 --> 01:54:10.580]   Sure they do.
[01:54:10.580 --> 01:54:11.580]   I think that's where he's going.
[01:54:11.580 --> 01:54:12.580]   He is in space.
[01:54:12.580 --> 01:54:16.740]   John McAfee is on his way.
[01:54:16.740 --> 01:54:19.220]   Leonardo DiCaprio, I love this story.
[01:54:19.220 --> 01:54:21.100]   I just saw it looked over your shoulder and I saw it.
[01:54:21.100 --> 01:54:23.260]   Leonardo DiCaprio.
[01:54:23.260 --> 01:54:25.460]   And how do you say his name?
[01:54:25.460 --> 01:54:27.700]   Um, don't know how this is.
[01:54:27.700 --> 01:54:30.380]   The second wrist man in the world and I never heard of him.
[01:54:30.380 --> 01:54:31.380]   Is she go-hoggy?
[01:54:31.380 --> 01:54:33.220]   Oh, are you talking about Carlos Slim?
[01:54:33.220 --> 01:54:35.420]   Oh, he's the, oh, Carlos Slim is the second.
[01:54:35.420 --> 01:54:39.700]   The Chicago-Coggy is the, uh, is the founder of this company Mobley, which is basically
[01:54:39.700 --> 01:54:40.860]   an Instagram clone.
[01:54:40.860 --> 01:54:43.060]   M-O-B-L-I, Mobley.
[01:54:43.060 --> 01:54:44.060]   Carlos Slim.
[01:54:44.060 --> 01:54:46.060]   Uh, why no Carlos Slim.
[01:54:46.060 --> 01:54:47.060]   Yeah.
[01:54:47.060 --> 01:54:49.180]   Yeah, Mexican telecommunications whiz.
[01:54:49.180 --> 01:54:50.180]   Yeah.
[01:54:50.180 --> 01:54:51.180]   He owns Mobiel.
[01:54:51.180 --> 01:54:52.180]   Uh, yeah.
[01:54:52.180 --> 01:54:55.900]   So, uh, this is the 60 million dollars in financing.
[01:54:55.900 --> 01:54:56.900]   Yeah.
[01:54:56.900 --> 01:54:57.900]   Now Mobley.
[01:54:57.900 --> 01:54:58.900]   Uh, and we have-
[01:54:58.900 --> 01:55:00.900]   What is Leo DiCaprio doing?
[01:55:00.900 --> 01:55:03.900]   Is he in a, is he jealous of Ashton Kutcher?
[01:55:03.900 --> 01:55:04.900]   He should be.
[01:55:04.900 --> 01:55:05.900]   He's very well-coused.
[01:55:05.900 --> 01:55:10.660]   So, why is Leo DiCaprio involved?
[01:55:10.660 --> 01:55:15.740]   Uh, I think, you know, this is c- Mobley, uh, they saw potentially an opportunity in
[01:55:15.740 --> 01:55:19.820]   Hollywood just getting much celebrities on board and outpacing Instagram that way.
[01:55:19.820 --> 01:55:23.860]   And now they're focused by bringing Carlos Slim on in the most recent funding rounds.

[01:57:46.860 --> 01:57:47.860]   And then they're focused on marketing.
[01:57:47.860 --> 01:57:48.860]   And then they're focused on marketing.
[01:57:48.860 --> 01:57:49.860]   And then they're focused on marketing.
[01:57:49.860 --> 01:57:50.860]   And then they're focused on marketing.
[01:57:50.860 --> 01:57:51.860]   And then they're focused on marketing.
[01:57:51.860 --> 01:57:52.860]   And then they're focused on marketing.
[01:57:52.860 --> 01:57:53.860]   And then they're focused on marketing.
[01:57:53.860 --> 01:57:54.860]   And then they're focused on marketing.
[01:57:54.860 --> 01:57:55.860]   And then they're focused on marketing.
[01:57:55.860 --> 01:57:56.860]   And then they're focused on marketing.
[01:57:56.860 --> 01:57:57.860]   And then they're focused on marketing.
[01:57:57.860 --> 01:57:58.860]   And then they're focused on marketing.
[01:57:58.860 --> 01:57:59.860]   And then they're focused on marketing.
[01:57:59.860 --> 01:58:00.860]   And then they're focused on marketing.
[01:58:00.860 --> 01:58:01.860]   And then they're focused on marketing.
[01:58:01.860 --> 01:58:02.860]   And then they're focused on marketing.
[01:58:02.860 --> 01:58:03.860]   And then they're focused on marketing.
[01:58:04.860 --> 01:58:05.860]   And then they're focused on marketing.
[01:58:05.860 --> 01:58:06.860]   And then they're focused on marketing.
[01:58:06.860 --> 01:58:07.860]   And then they're focused on marketing.
[01:58:07.860 --> 01:58:08.860]   And then they're focused on marketing.
[01:58:08.860 --> 01:58:09.860]   And then they're focused on marketing.
[01:58:09.860 --> 01:58:10.860]   And then they're focused on marketing.
[01:58:10.860 --> 01:58:11.860]   And then they're focused on marketing.
[01:58:11.860 --> 01:58:12.860]   And then they're focused on marketing.
[01:58:12.860 --> 01:58:13.860]   And then they're focused on marketing.
[01:58:13.860 --> 01:58:14.860]   And then they're focused on marketing.
[01:58:14.860 --> 01:58:15.860]   And then they're focused on marketing.
[01:58:15.860 --> 01:58:16.860]   And then they're focused on marketing.
[01:58:16.860 --> 01:58:17.860]   And then they're focused on marketing.
[01:58:17.860 --> 01:58:18.860]   And then they're focused on marketing.
[01:58:18.860 --> 01:58:19.860]   And then they're focused on marketing.
[01:58:19.860 --> 01:58:20.860]   And then they're focused on marketing.
[01:58:20.860 --> 01:58:21.860]   And then they're focused on marketing.
[01:58:21.860 --> 01:58:22.860]   And then they're focused on marketing.
[01:58:22.860 --> 01:58:23.860]   And then they're focused on marketing.
[01:58:23.860 --> 01:58:24.860]   And then they're focused on marketing.
[01:58:24.860 --> 01:58:25.860]   And then they're focused on marketing.
[01:58:25.860 --> 01:58:26.860]   And then they're focused on marketing.
[01:58:27.860 --> 01:58:28.860]   Yes.
[01:58:28.860 --> 01:58:29.860]   All right.
[01:58:29.860 --> 01:58:30.860]   I'd like to end the show with homework.
[01:58:30.860 --> 01:58:32.860]   Because what would be a show without homework?
[01:58:32.860 --> 01:58:35.860]   Your homework is to call your member of Congress and say,
[01:58:35.860 --> 01:58:38.860]   "I support J. Rockefeller's consumer choice
[01:58:38.860 --> 01:58:40.860]   in online video act.
[01:58:40.860 --> 01:58:43.860]   If we could get this past, life would be wonderful."
[01:58:43.860 --> 01:58:47.860]   J. Rockefeller, who is on the, he chairs the Senate Commerce
[01:58:47.860 --> 01:58:49.860]   Science Transportation Committee,
[01:58:49.860 --> 01:58:54.860]   is trying to get cable companies to unbundle channels,
[01:58:54.860 --> 01:58:58.860]   force them to sell individual channels instead of packages,
[01:58:58.860 --> 01:59:00.860]   bar them, cable satellite broadcasts,
[01:59:00.860 --> 01:59:04.860]   and large media companies from engaging in any competitive
[01:59:04.860 --> 01:59:07.860]   practices against online video distributors.
[01:59:07.860 --> 01:59:09.860]   Limit the ability of broadband providers
[01:59:09.860 --> 01:59:12.860]   to degrade competitive online video services.
[01:59:12.860 --> 01:59:15.860]   Don't screw in my Netflix.
[01:59:15.860 --> 01:59:17.860]   Empower consumers with truth and billing protections
[01:59:17.860 --> 01:59:19.860]   for broadband internet.
[01:59:19.860 --> 01:59:21.860]   I mean, it goes on and on.
[01:59:21.860 --> 01:59:25.860]   This is so good that it's undoubtedly going to fail in Congress.
[01:59:25.860 --> 01:59:31.860]   But if you like the idea, write your Congress, critter.
[01:59:31.860 --> 01:59:32.860]   Just say, "Hello.
[01:59:32.860 --> 01:59:34.860]   Remember me from SOPA?
[01:59:34.860 --> 01:59:35.860]   I'm back."
[01:59:35.860 --> 01:59:39.860]   And I want you to support J. Rockefeller's consumer choice
[01:59:39.860 --> 01:59:42.860]   in online video act.
[01:59:42.860 --> 01:59:44.860]   So there, that's your assignment.
[01:59:44.860 --> 01:59:46.860]   Hey, thank you so much for being here.
[01:59:46.860 --> 01:59:47.860]   I really appreciate it.
[01:59:47.860 --> 01:59:49.860]   Jason Heiner from Tech Republic, TechRepublic.com.
[01:59:49.860 --> 01:59:52.860]   And debonair, Google Glasser.
[01:59:52.860 --> 01:59:54.860]   It still looks dorky.
[01:59:54.860 --> 01:59:56.860]   It is more useful.
[01:59:56.860 --> 01:59:58.860]   Anything you want to plug that you're up to these days?
[01:59:58.860 --> 02:00:00.860]   You know, the interesting thing that I'm working on
[02:00:00.860 --> 02:00:03.860]   is a lot more long form stuff.
[02:00:03.860 --> 02:00:07.860]   So both on ZDNet and Tech Republic and globally,
[02:00:07.860 --> 02:00:11.860]   we have a team of editors across in Singapore and Sydney,
[02:00:11.860 --> 02:00:15.860]   Australia and London, and then Louisville, New York,
[02:00:15.860 --> 02:00:17.860]   and San Francisco and the US.
[02:00:17.860 --> 02:00:21.860]   And we're doing, we put together packages of stuff.
[02:00:21.860 --> 02:00:23.860]   We go deep on one topic a month on ZDNet.
[02:00:23.860 --> 02:00:27.860]   And then on Tech Republic, we do really in-depth, long form
[02:00:27.860 --> 02:00:30.860]   articles on, you know, really important topics,
[02:00:30.860 --> 02:00:33.860]   like the one I mentioned, the Israel trying to create.
[02:00:33.860 --> 02:00:35.860]   It's the next Silicon Valley was one.
[02:00:35.860 --> 02:00:38.860]   We also have one on Munich, which has kind of kicked all
[02:00:38.860 --> 02:00:42.860]   proprietary software off their city network and has gone completely
[02:00:42.860 --> 02:00:43.860]   open source.
[02:00:43.860 --> 02:00:44.860]   That one's publishing next week.
[02:00:44.860 --> 02:00:47.860]   So yeah, come check it out.
[02:00:47.860 --> 02:00:49.860]   And if you're interested in global tech,
[02:00:49.860 --> 02:00:50.860]   I love long form stuff.
[02:00:50.860 --> 02:00:55.860]   I don't have time to read it, but the idea is great.
[02:00:55.860 --> 02:00:58.860]   And I have like 8,000 articles in my pocket.
[02:00:58.860 --> 02:00:59.860]   You know, my pocket.
[02:00:59.860 --> 02:01:00.860]   These are 20,000 words.
[02:01:00.860 --> 02:01:02.860]   They're more like three to five thousand.
[02:01:02.860 --> 02:01:04.860]   Someday I'm going to get to read all those New Yorkers I've
[02:01:04.860 --> 02:01:06.860]   got piled up in my closet.
[02:01:06.860 --> 02:01:12.860]   Bloomberg Business Week, Mr. Mark Million, go to the new global tech.
[02:01:12.860 --> 02:01:14.860]   You know, it really is interesting.
[02:01:14.860 --> 02:01:15.860]   We don't know what's going on.
[02:01:15.860 --> 02:01:19.860]   Here's, you know, Pavel Duraov, the Mark Zuckerberg of Russia.
[02:01:19.860 --> 02:01:22.860]   Yeah, I spent several hours with him for that story.
[02:01:22.860 --> 02:01:27.860]   He's a very reclusive founder, founder of the biggest social
[02:01:27.860 --> 02:01:30.860]   network in Russia called V Contaktke.
[02:01:30.860 --> 02:01:35.860]   And I spent some time with him here in Silicon Valley and when
[02:01:35.860 --> 02:01:39.860]   I was overseas a couple of weeks ago, he's a really interesting
[02:01:39.860 --> 02:01:39.860]   guy.
[02:01:39.860 --> 02:01:41.860]   He's a huge fan of the Matrix movies.
[02:01:41.860 --> 02:01:43.860]   So he always dresses like in these.
[02:01:43.860 --> 02:01:44.860]   He looks like Neo.
[02:01:44.860 --> 02:01:45.860]   Yeah.
[02:01:45.860 --> 02:01:46.860]   Like a scarf wrap.
[02:01:46.860 --> 02:01:49.860]   He actually looks like a store mannequin in that picture.
[02:01:49.860 --> 02:01:50.860]   I don't do something.
[02:01:50.860 --> 02:01:55.860]   Is that really a person or is it just a mannequin posing as a
[02:01:55.860 --> 02:01:56.860]   Pavel Duraov?
[02:01:56.860 --> 02:01:57.860]   Very interesting.
[02:01:57.860 --> 02:01:59.860]   Bloomberg.com.
[02:01:59.860 --> 02:02:00.860]   It's a long URL.
[02:02:00.860 --> 02:02:01.860]   What's the easiest way to get it?
[02:02:01.860 --> 02:02:03.860]   Bloomberg.com/globaltech.
[02:02:03.860 --> 02:02:04.860]   That works?
[02:02:04.860 --> 02:02:05.860]   Oh good.
[02:02:05.860 --> 02:02:06.860]   Okay.
[02:02:06.860 --> 02:02:07.860]   And thank you, Mark.
[02:02:07.860 --> 02:02:08.860]   It's always great to see you.
[02:02:08.860 --> 02:02:09.860]   Thanks for being here.
[02:02:09.860 --> 02:02:10.860]   I really appreciate it.

[02:03:27.860 --> 02:03:28.860]   Thank you.
[02:03:28.860 --> 02:03:29.860]   Thank you.
[02:03:29.860 --> 02:03:30.860]   Thank you.
[02:03:30.860 --> 02:03:31.860]   Thank you.
[02:03:31.860 --> 02:03:32.860]   Thank you.
[02:03:32.860 --> 02:03:33.860]   Thank you.
[02:03:33.860 --> 02:03:34.860]   Thank you.
[02:03:34.860 --> 02:03:35.860]   Thank you.
[02:03:35.860 --> 02:03:36.860]   Thank you.
[02:03:36.860 --> 02:03:37.860]   Thank you.
[02:03:37.860 --> 02:03:38.860]   Thank you.
[02:03:38.860 --> 02:03:39.860]   Thank you.
[02:03:39.860 --> 02:03:40.860]   Thank you.
[02:03:40.860 --> 02:03:41.860]   Thank you.
[02:03:41.860 --> 02:03:42.860]   Thank you.
[02:03:42.860 --> 02:03:43.860]   It's so great to see you, Christina Warren.
[02:03:43.860 --> 02:03:44.860]   You just never failed to impress.
[02:03:44.860 --> 02:03:45.860]   You have the best hat in show business today.
[02:03:45.860 --> 02:03:46.860]   Thank you.
[02:03:46.860 --> 02:03:49.860]   And a clock that never tells the right time.
[02:03:49.860 --> 02:03:50.860]   Which we enjoy.
[02:03:50.860 --> 02:03:51.860]   Yes.
[02:03:51.860 --> 02:03:54.860]   And a clueless poster, which is epic and awesome.
[02:03:54.860 --> 02:03:55.860]   Is that what that is?
[02:03:55.860 --> 02:03:56.860]   I've been trying to figure out.
[02:03:56.860 --> 02:03:57.860]   Okay.
[02:03:57.860 --> 02:03:59.860]   Clueless over a left shoulder.
[02:03:59.860 --> 02:04:00.860]   What's the story with the clock?
[02:04:00.860 --> 02:04:02.860]   Because the chat room's really been having fun with that.
[02:04:02.860 --> 02:04:03.860]   Yeah.
[02:04:03.860 --> 02:04:04.860]   I just need to put a new battery in it.
[02:04:04.860 --> 02:04:06.860]   And that's really odd.
[02:04:06.860 --> 02:04:07.860]   That's what it was.
[02:04:07.860 --> 02:04:11.860]   She took the battery out to put it in the smoke detector and then used the worst history.
[02:04:11.860 --> 02:04:12.860]   Exactly.
[02:04:12.860 --> 02:04:13.860]   And then you forgot.
[02:04:13.860 --> 02:04:15.860]   It was totally just the battery in it.
[02:04:15.860 --> 02:04:17.860]   Christina writes at Mashable.com.
[02:04:17.860 --> 02:04:20.860]   Anything you want to plug for yourself?
[02:04:20.860 --> 02:04:21.860]   Well, you know what?
[02:04:21.860 --> 02:04:27.860]   I wrote, I guess the best thing I probably wrote last week was my long overdue review
[02:04:27.860 --> 02:04:29.860]   of the new 15-inch MacBook Pro with retina.
[02:04:29.860 --> 02:04:31.860]   And I'm actually pretty happy with how that turned out.
[02:04:31.860 --> 02:04:33.860]   I don't want to have to send it back in.
[02:04:33.860 --> 02:04:36.860]   But actually, when I'm talking on right now and I'm going to be very sad to send it back,
[02:04:36.860 --> 02:04:37.860]   it's very laughter.
[02:04:37.860 --> 02:04:38.860]   Oh, I'm using it right now.
[02:04:38.860 --> 02:04:39.860]   And you're absolutely right.
[02:04:39.860 --> 02:04:40.860]   I love it.
[02:04:40.860 --> 02:04:41.860]   I love it.
[02:04:41.860 --> 02:04:44.860]   I'm very sad to have to send it back.
[02:04:44.860 --> 02:04:47.860]   But yeah, I mean, that's basically was my last big thing that I wrote.
[02:04:47.860 --> 02:04:49.860]   But I just keep it tuned to Mashable.
[02:04:49.860 --> 02:04:54.300]   You know, we cover tech news and social stuff and lots and lots of cat videos and things
[02:04:54.300 --> 02:04:56.860]   about Pokemon fan theories and stuff like that.
[02:04:56.860 --> 02:05:00.500]   And the Jean Claude Van Damne video, if you guys haven't seen that, people in the chat
[02:05:00.500 --> 02:05:01.500]   were talking about it.
[02:05:01.500 --> 02:05:02.500]   It's pretty amazing.
[02:05:02.500 --> 02:05:04.500]   And you just hired from the New York Times.
[02:05:04.500 --> 02:05:05.500]   Jim Roberts.
[02:05:05.500 --> 02:05:06.500]   Jim Roberts.
[02:05:06.500 --> 02:05:07.500]   Yeah.
[02:05:07.500 --> 02:05:08.500]   Huge.
[02:05:08.500 --> 02:05:09.500]   Huge.
[02:05:09.500 --> 02:05:10.500]   Huge.
[02:05:10.500 --> 02:05:11.500]   Yeah, he starts tomorrow.
[02:05:11.500 --> 02:05:12.500]   We're very, very excited.
[02:05:12.500 --> 02:05:13.500]   Yeah.
[02:05:13.500 --> 02:05:18.780]   And I don't know when you do the read design, but I just think it looks great.
[02:05:18.780 --> 02:05:19.780]   No read design.
[02:05:19.780 --> 02:05:21.780]   Yeah, that's been about a year.
[02:05:21.780 --> 02:05:22.780]   A year.
[02:05:22.780 --> 02:05:23.780]   Okay.
[02:05:23.780 --> 02:05:24.780]   I just need to write it out.
[02:05:24.780 --> 02:05:27.220]   I read Mashable every day.
[02:05:27.220 --> 02:05:29.700]   I don't go to Mashable.com.
[02:05:29.700 --> 02:05:30.780]   I read it on Flipboard.
[02:05:30.780 --> 02:05:31.780]   I read it.
[02:05:31.780 --> 02:05:32.780]   I never see the front page.
[02:05:32.780 --> 02:05:34.060]   That's how everybody reads news.
[02:05:34.060 --> 02:05:35.780]   Well, reads, who goes to the front page anything?
[02:05:35.780 --> 02:05:36.940]   Anything, any more on pages.
[02:05:36.940 --> 02:05:37.940]   It's a nice front page.
[02:05:37.940 --> 02:05:39.540]   You should go there more often.
[02:05:39.540 --> 02:05:40.780]   I like it.
[02:05:40.780 --> 02:05:42.660]   Our tech and product teams have done an amazing job.
[02:05:42.660 --> 02:05:44.380]   But yeah, Jim, Jim is a great hire.
[02:05:44.380 --> 02:05:46.940]   We're super ecstatic about it.
[02:05:46.940 --> 02:05:48.180]   I mean, like I kind of can't believe it.
[02:05:48.180 --> 02:05:49.180]   Like, oh my God.
[02:05:49.180 --> 02:05:51.580]   Like, you know, because he's one of the rock stars of the news industry.
[02:05:51.580 --> 02:05:53.060]   So we're really excited.
[02:05:53.060 --> 02:05:55.340]   And of course, Lance, you went off my old friend.
[02:05:55.340 --> 02:05:56.340]   He's doing a great job there.
[02:05:56.340 --> 02:05:57.340]   Yeah.
[02:05:57.340 --> 02:05:58.340]   Lance is amazing, you know, editor chief.
[02:05:58.340 --> 02:05:59.660]   And he's a great guy.
[02:05:59.660 --> 02:06:04.700]   The very first PC magazine I ever read when I decided to get into computers.
[02:06:04.700 --> 02:06:07.180]   He was the graphics editor.
[02:06:07.180 --> 02:06:08.180]   Yeah.
[02:06:08.180 --> 02:06:10.140]   And something he wrote was actually in that article.
[02:06:10.140 --> 02:06:14.780]   And actually, because of Google Books, I was able to find Google Magazine back from 1995.
[02:06:14.780 --> 02:06:15.780]   Yep.
[02:06:15.780 --> 02:06:17.940]   There's value to the search engine.
[02:06:17.940 --> 02:06:18.940]   There it is.
[02:06:18.940 --> 02:06:20.300]   And does that Scottish guy ever come in anymore?
[02:06:20.300 --> 02:06:21.300]   That cash more kid?
[02:06:21.300 --> 02:06:22.300]   Does he ever stop by anymore?
[02:06:22.300 --> 02:06:23.300]   Or is he out of it?
[02:06:23.300 --> 02:06:24.300]   You know what's usually he's still there?
[02:06:24.300 --> 02:06:25.300]   Yeah, no, he's still there.
[02:06:25.300 --> 02:06:26.300]   He's still there.
[02:06:26.300 --> 02:06:28.660]   I love Pete.
[02:06:28.660 --> 02:06:30.580]   It's funny because he's so shy.
[02:06:30.580 --> 02:06:31.580]   We tried.
[02:06:31.580 --> 02:06:33.940]   He's been on Twitter and we try to get him back.
[02:06:33.940 --> 02:06:36.300]   He's been on was on many times in the early days.
[02:06:36.300 --> 02:06:40.980]   And finally, Lisa told me, Lisa, his girlfriend told me he's too shy.
[02:06:40.980 --> 02:06:42.380]   He doesn't want to do it.
[02:06:42.380 --> 02:06:43.380]   He's shy.
[02:06:43.380 --> 02:06:46.020]   He's like the best looking guy in tech.
[02:06:46.020 --> 02:06:47.020]   But he's shy.
[02:06:47.020 --> 02:06:48.020]   Yeah.
[02:06:48.020 --> 02:06:49.020]   He's so shy.
[02:06:49.020 --> 02:06:50.020]   Yeah.
[02:06:50.020 --> 02:06:51.500]   Well, anyway, it's great to talk to you all.
[02:06:51.500 --> 02:06:52.500]   Thank you for being here.
[02:06:52.500 --> 02:06:53.500]   Good news.
[02:06:53.500 --> 02:06:54.740]   The Simpsons is going to be available for streaming.
[02:06:54.740 --> 02:06:57.100]   You won't have to watch Twitter for much longer.
[02:06:57.100 --> 02:06:58.100]   That's exciting news.
[02:06:58.100 --> 02:06:59.940]   Oh, it's not been for you.
[02:06:59.940 --> 02:07:03.020]   I was trying to watch the mono rail episode.
[02:07:03.020 --> 02:07:08.820]   There's no way to buy the mono rail episode without buying some crap DVD that I don't
[02:07:08.820 --> 02:07:09.820]   want.
[02:07:09.820 --> 02:07:11.820]   Finally, season six, I think.
[02:07:11.820 --> 02:07:12.820]   It's a mono.
[02:07:12.820 --> 02:07:13.820]   That's right.
[02:07:13.820 --> 02:07:14.820]   Conan O'Brien wrote it.
[02:07:14.820 --> 02:07:18.900]   It's considered by many one of the greatest episodes of television ever made.
[02:07:18.900 --> 02:07:20.820]   And you cannot stream it.
[02:07:20.820 --> 02:07:23.620]   But you will soon because they were they were.
[02:07:23.620 --> 02:07:24.620]   I love the group.
[02:07:24.620 --> 02:07:25.620]   Go ahead.
[02:07:25.620 --> 02:07:27.980]   Plus you go to some of the bad sites.
[02:07:27.980 --> 02:07:28.980]   There are many sites.
[02:07:28.980 --> 02:07:31.060]   I don't know where you could stream it because I look.
[02:07:31.060 --> 02:07:35.940]   That's where some of the streaming TV sites that are on the downbox.
[02:07:35.940 --> 02:07:38.340]   And I could not find it anywhere.
[02:07:38.340 --> 02:07:42.300]   And the reason was obviously Fox was getting a lot of money for syndication.
[02:07:42.300 --> 02:07:44.660]   24 seasons worth.
[02:07:44.660 --> 02:07:50.060]   But now it'll be on FX now, the mobile viewing app for FX networks.
[02:07:50.060 --> 02:07:52.060]   All right.
[02:07:52.060 --> 02:07:58.140]   I think we've done more than enough damage to my credibility and to your time.
[02:07:58.140 --> 02:08:03.340]   If your butt isn't numb yet, you're not sitting on these comfortable chairs.
[02:08:03.340 --> 02:08:05.580]   We've purchased for all of you.
[02:08:05.580 --> 02:08:06.580]   Thank you for being here.
[02:08:06.580 --> 02:08:08.180]   You can watch Twit Live 3 p.m.
[02:08:08.180 --> 02:08:15.580]   Pacific Sunday evening, 6 p.m. Eastern time, 2200, 2,300 UTC on twit.tv.
[02:08:15.580 --> 02:08:17.380]   If you don't get the live version, it's okay.
[02:08:17.380 --> 02:08:18.380]   I mean, I wish you would.
[02:08:18.380 --> 02:08:23.100]   But if you can't watch live, we will put a version with really loud bleep sounds in
[02:08:23.100 --> 02:08:24.100]   it.
[02:08:24.100 --> 02:08:26.540]   A veil, never again.
[02:08:26.540 --> 02:08:31.060]   I have to, I totally apologize for the deafening bleep tones.
[02:08:31.060 --> 02:08:33.460]   There was an error on the factory floor.
[02:08:33.460 --> 02:08:37.460]   One of the robots who makes the show went amok.
[02:08:37.460 --> 02:08:44.380]   And apparently amplified the bleep sounds louder than any human can tolerate.
[02:08:44.380 --> 02:08:47.620]   So I've got a new thing now, John, and all the editors.
[02:08:47.620 --> 02:08:48.980]   I've got a bleeping profanity.
[02:08:48.980 --> 02:08:52.340]   Remember, Christina said one bad word in this whole show.
[02:08:52.340 --> 02:08:53.780]   Just it's okay.
[02:08:53.780 --> 02:08:55.700]   Do what they do in rap videos.
[02:08:55.700 --> 02:08:57.500]   Take it and reflect it, reverse it.
[02:08:57.500 --> 02:08:58.500]   So it's backwards.
[02:08:58.500 --> 02:09:04.420]   It'll be just, it'll be just, it'll be like to listen to Eminem.
[02:09:04.420 --> 02:09:05.940]   It'll be, and it'll be the same level.
[02:09:05.940 --> 02:09:07.260]   It won't bother anybody.
[02:09:07.260 --> 02:09:09.660]   In fact, if you're not really paying attention, you don't know what happened.
[02:09:09.660 --> 02:09:12.820]   It's like what?
[02:09:12.820 --> 02:09:14.180]   So that's, I'm sorry.
[02:09:14.180 --> 02:09:15.180]   I apologize.
[02:09:15.180 --> 02:09:17.500]   Please keep listening to Twit even though we deafened you.
[02:09:17.500 --> 02:09:18.500]   Do whatever you can.
[02:09:18.500 --> 02:09:19.700]   Get a cochlear implant, whatever.
[02:09:19.700 --> 02:09:20.700]   I'm sorry.
[02:09:20.700 --> 02:09:29.100]   Um, live on demand also at twit.tv and wherever finer podcasts are made available to you.
[02:09:29.100 --> 02:09:30.340]   Thank you very much for being here.
[02:09:30.340 --> 02:09:31.340]   We'll see you next time.
[02:09:31.340 --> 02:09:32.340]   Another Twit.
[02:09:32.340 --> 02:09:33.340]   See you soon.
[02:09:33.340 --> 02:09:34.340]   See you soon.
[02:09:34.340 --> 02:09:35.340]   And do the Twit.
[02:09:35.340 --> 02:09:36.340]   All right.
[02:09:36.340 --> 02:09:37.340]   Do the Twit, baby.
[02:09:37.340 --> 02:09:38.340]   Do the Twit.
[02:09:38.340 --> 02:09:39.340]   All right.
[02:09:39.340 --> 02:09:40.340]   Do the Twit, baby.
[02:09:40.340 --> 02:09:41.340]   Do the Twit.
[02:09:41.340 --> 02:09:42.340]   All right.
[02:09:42.340 --> 02:09:43.340]   Do the Twit, baby.
