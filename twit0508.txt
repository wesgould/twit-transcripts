[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.720]   We have such a good panel.
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.840]   I don't even know where to start.
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.640]   So I'm just going to go, I guess, right to left or something like that.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.640]   I don't know.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:23.760]   Starting with Owen J.J. Stone, oh, Dr. On The Horn from his Mystery Layer in New Jersey.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.360]   My mystery layer has been downgraded to subpar cave because we have another guest with a super
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.360]   duper mystery layer.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.840]   So I'm just like in a whole, in a back room somewhere wrapped up in a broom closet or
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.840]   something like that.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.840]   Oh, no.
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.880]   Move that microphone right in on there so we can hear you better.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.120]   Are you using that snowball there?
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.120]   Is that what that is?
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.120]   I am.
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.120]   I have a better mic.
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.120]   I don't know where it is.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.120]   It's in a box somewhere.
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.480]   You sound good with as long as it's close to you, sound good.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.480]   It's good to see you.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.480]   I can take it close to me.
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.240]   Oh, Dr. Also with his Harry McCracken, the technologizer.
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.280]   Everybody on the show is going to have a nickname.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.280]   I brought my own.
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.280]   You brought your own.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.280]   And I'm a good homologizer.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.600]   It's good to see you once again, Harry from Fast Company.com.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.020]   Good to be here.
[00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.000]   One of the great tech journalists for many, many years.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.240]   Here's a guy you would not expect to see on this show, but I brought him back.
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.240]   Mr. Jason Calico.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:13.240]   It's good to be home.
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.480]   I missed you.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.360]   We have a little falling out.
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:23.920]   I was a small petty individual and I apologize, but I'm thrilled to have you back.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:24.920]   It's good to be home.
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.080]   It's good to be home.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.640]   We've got a newbie.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.640]   This is great.
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.720]   We're really thrown into the lines.
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.760]   Georgia Dow from iMoor.com.
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.760]   It's great to see you, Georgia.
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.200]   You've been on other shows, but this is your first time on Twitch, right?
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.200]   I know.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.200]   I'm so excited.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.760]   Oh, we're so glad to have you.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.760]   Thank you.
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.200]   Georgia's you're in Montreal.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.080]   I'm in Montreal.
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:51.040]   And you see here regularly on iMoor and on the iMoor podcast.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.320]   And there is so much to talk about.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.800]   I don't even know where to begin.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:59.440]   Microsoft had billed this week and there was a lot of news from Microsoft.
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:05.920]   Elon Musk announced Tesla's new product and it's not a car.
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.520]   We're all wearing Apple watches except for Owen.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.120]   Are you wearing your Apple watch?
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.040]   No, I sold the first one.
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.800]   I got the new one coming in next week.
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.320]   You got one and you sold it already?
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.720]   I messed up because I bought two and I didn't know if I wanted the sport or the sales
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.360]   deal and I don't want the stainless steel.
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.600]   So I sold it.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.600]   So you get the sport?
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.400]   So I can get my maximum dollar out of it, which was people that wanted to overpay for
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.400]   it.
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:33.400]   You made a profit?
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.400]   I doubled my money.
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.400]   So I got my sport for free.
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.400]   Oh, that's smart.
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.760]   Tonight, all you had to do was get up in midnight.
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.160]   I was up and ordering away and I ordered two because I didn't know what I wanted.
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.160]   So I was like, oh, good it.
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.160]   And then I got it.
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.160]   I opened it.
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.160]   I said, no, bye bye.
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.720]   And somebody paid double the price.
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.720]   Wow.
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:52.720]   Yeah.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.560]   Free watch.
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.560]   And that's weak.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.560]   My other watch comes up.
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.800]   They're kicking themselves now because Apple has advanced the I wasn't supposed to get this
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.140]   till later this month and I got it last week.
[00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.480]   This is the 42 millimeter.
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.120]   So Apple is actually kind of loosened the dials a little bit.
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:13.780]   Georgia, you have a sport, but you have the sport and I have it on the white band, but
[00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.240]   I'm getting the Milanese band as well.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.120]   I love that.
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.000]   So this so all of these are new changeable, right?
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.560]   You can use any band with any watch.
[00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:22.560]   Yeah.
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.400]   You can use any band.
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.400]   I can't.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.960]   I was hoping to steal from all of Renee's, but he got the 42 and I'm on the 38 because
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.240]   I have my new wrists.
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.440]   So yes, you can interchange as you need and really easily.
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.320]   I was using the 38 because I got Lisa's first and now I'm using the 42.
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.560]   You have a 42 sport.
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.560]   42 sport.
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.560]   I got like, because they let us get one at inside because of the developer kit.
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.760]   So they just sent us one early.
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.760]   But I think this is.
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.400]   Oh, so your inside app is on the watch already?
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.800]   No, just the SMS, but they featured us.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.040]   So we have a good relationship with them.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.640]   And I think when you're a top developer, they'll give it to you like first shot at bat.
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:03.440]   So I also have another one coming like a doctor, but I have to say, I think this is
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.240]   going to be a great, great success for them.
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.200]   I could see this, you know, easily being 25 to 50 million a year.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.200]   Watch here.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:16.800]   If they can, if they can produce that many because the, the act of getting your SMS messages
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.520]   here and your alerts here is so delightful, I think.
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.400]   But once people see the early adopters with it, they're going to want it.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:27.840]   And at Christmas, you know, there's, there's really like people went back and downgraded
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.240]   their iPhone sixes to five.
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.240]   So like, Eve Williams was like, I don't like the six.
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.440]   I'm going to go back to the five.
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:33.440]   Really?
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.440]   Yeah.
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:37.160]   And I think a lot of people don't feel the necessity to keep updating their phone.
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.720]   So they have a little bit of extra budget.
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:39.720]   So they buy the watch.
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.640]   So they buy the watch because it's a, it's, it really does enhance the experience when
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:48.920]   you're waiting for an Uber or you're getting like news and you can just look at your wrist
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.960]   and then meetings and I was at the movies yesterday and I had alerts coming in from
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:53.960]   the babysitter.
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.800]   Oh, I bet everybody behind you loved that as you're watching.
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:56.800]   You're watching.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.800]   Laid up every five minutes.
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.800]   Better than lighting up.
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.920]   And did you jump up every hour and do some exercise?
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.440]   No, I didn't do that.
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:06.640]   But that, that is the annoying, that is the most annoying part of it when it's like, you
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.120]   could turn that off now.
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:09.120]   You could get up now.
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:14.720]   First thing that I turned off was the annoying reminder to stand up and then the trash talking
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:18.760]   from my watch saying that I have not made my activity goals this week.
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.000]   I'm like, you know what?
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   Done.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   I don't need that.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   That's what you have parents for.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   Sorry.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Off.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.640]   I was at a conference and I got the neck, the neck note to stand up when I was sitting
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.320]   down and had to.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.880]   She literally just stood up in the middle of a conference.
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:33.880]   I've been doing that.
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.040]   Everybody's like, wow, Harry's losing it.
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.520]   I've been doing it on stage since show in shows.
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:39.720]   I've been jumping up just randomly standing up.
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.720]   Yeah.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.960]   I think it's actually better for movies than now.
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:43.960]   I got the little stars.
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.400]   Did you get the gold star?
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:46.960]   I haven't got my gold star yet.
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.240]   You know what Tim, coach, I got a gold star on here.
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.000]   I got some really pitiful luxury of my.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.480]   That's because Uncle Leo stand up anywhere.
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.480]   He's that he's a boss.
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.480]   He doesn't care.
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.480]   He stands up in the movies.
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.200]   He says about the baseball game.
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.200]   It doesn't matter.
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.200]   He just stands up.
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:02.960]   I'm already all the way around.
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:03.960]   Look at that.
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:10.480]   I'm so sad that when I got my stand up reminder when I was having dinner, I actually like just
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:14.120]   did this with my arm and kind of waved it around for a while.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.120]   Did it fool it?
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.120]   Yeah.
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.120]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.160]   Then I got my stand up and I'm like, huh, game this.
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.440]   So can I tell you?
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.440]   I hate this thing.
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.440]   I don't think this is a product at all.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.200]   Jason, I think you're completely wrong.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:28.200]   Wow.
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.200]   Here we go.
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.200]   I'll come back to the show.
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:35.920]   I feel like I suddenly got it because I've worn these all now.
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:40.160]   And Android Wear and Pebble and you're wearing the basis.
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.640]   You actually wear two watches.
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.080]   You're crazy.
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:51.320]   And I finally realized as much as I want this category to take off, they're too damn small
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.840]   to be useful.
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:55.880]   And the UI is too difficult on something this small.
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.040]   It's the same problem I had with Google Glass.
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.040]   It's too fussy.
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.040]   It's too finicky.
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.640]   It's too hard to get it to work.
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:07.560]   Especially when everything I do on this, I can do on my phone, which is right here.
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:12.160]   So I feel like I thought I was hopeful that Apple, just as they have in the past with
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:16.560]   the iPod, the iPad, the iPhone, would take an existing category and figure out the secret
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:18.280]   sauce that would make it sing.
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:23.200]   Now that I've had this for 10 days, they didn't.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.200]   And I just feel like this.
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.200]   I disagreeing entirely.
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.080]   I think this is not going to sell worse and worse.
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.080]   No.
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:30.080]   I'm right in the middle.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:33.320]   So as average consumers, people wanted a big phone.
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:38.640]   The sale of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus show that people holding on their iPhone 4 is waiting
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.440]   for an i6 and i6 Plus 2.
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:43.920]   So why do they want this little stamp size doo-y?
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:44.920]   That's my point.
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.720]   That's something that will be a novelty, but I don't think that's a necessity.
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.360]   This watch is not a necessity.
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.720]   It doesn't change my world and my lifestyle that I need to have it.
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:58.000]   And secondly, most people that have regular funds look at it and say, well, all Apple's
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.040]   going to do is come out with a better one next year.
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.520]   Why if I get one, I have to get the cheapest one because there's no way in the world I'm
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.400]   going to spend more money than I have to knowing the next year.
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:10.000]   It's going to be thinner and lighter and faster and you're going to want to get rid of it.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.080]   So thinner and lighter is not going to solve it.
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.080]   It's too small.
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:18.160]   It's a postage stamp on your wrist and it makes it no matter what, no matter who's making
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.360]   it, it makes it difficult to really be useful.
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.360]   Okay.
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.880]   So I know it depends on how you use it, right?
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:25.960]   I'm with Jason on this.
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:29.600]   I think that I use it just like I don't use it for many things.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:34.400]   I use it for use case scenarios where I want to do something quick, fast and seamless without
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:35.880]   any bugging anyone.
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:39.920]   So I use it for turning on my lights, changing my hues, turning off my lights, opening my
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:45.520]   door, shazamming music and answering calls and just checking notifications so that I
[00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.320]   know if I have to get out my phone or not.
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:49.600]   And that makes my life easier.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:53.960]   I think that it makes things faster and I enjoy using it for those cases.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:57.520]   I don't really interface with it very much besides that.
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.840]   The apps are going to need to catch up for sure.
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:04.360]   That's the issue is right now the having to hunt and peck to get what you want is a real
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.360]   bummer.
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.360]   Absolutely can see that.
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.880]   But when you get a nice delightful alert like, Hey, here's the SMS.
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:13.040]   Here is your Uber's arriving, your food's arriving.
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:16.600]   When those just gentle notifications come and you don't have to take it out, I think
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:17.760]   people are going to become addicted to it.
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:18.760]   How lazy have we become?
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:19.760]   Very easy.
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.760]   You really asked me the next question.
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:26.720]   I don't understand why it's so hard to look at your phone.
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.880]   Have you not seen Wally where everyone's like sitting in those mood around?
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.640]   That's how lazy.
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:37.240]   I was getting that messages of how to drive, which was fabulous because it was on my wrist
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:40.360]   it was easy to see and it was telling me which way to turn.
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.440]   I actually agree with you on that.
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:47.520]   I discovered that last fall when we were in London with the Android Wear and I said,
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:51.280]   you know, take us to the Tower of London and it, but just like the Apple watch, it was
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:53.040]   as you turn left, turn right.
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:58.640]   I think that's that is there are, but you have to be walking and you have to be like
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.200]   trying to find something you can't find.
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.200]   There's Wally.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.200]   Thanks.
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.200]   Yeah.
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.200]   So we know the world is going to want to take this.
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.200]   You press for a big go.
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.120]   I like smart watches when I'm up and about and walking around because when I'm walking
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:11.400]   around, I don't want to be using my phone and the smart watch works really well.
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:16.560]   I also think that basically almost all the Apple watch apps that exist were written by
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.560]   people would never seen an Apple watch and they wrote the app.
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:20.560]   That's absolutely true.
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:24.120]   The watch is going to take at least 60 to 90 days before it's really clear what's going
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:29.560]   on and I think the killer apps for the most part will not be written by Apple to a larger
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:30.560]   extent than usual.
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:34.160]   It's going to be the third parties that either make this thing compelling or fail to make
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.360]   this thing compelling.
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:38.040]   And I grant you that we've talked about this on MacPherick weekly.
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.560]   The ecosystem could change things.
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.120]   Apple pays interesting fences.
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:44.520]   Although again, with Apple pay, I don't find it so much of a convenience because I still
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.640]   have to debit or credit.
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:47.640]   Do you want cash back?
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:51.240]   I actually have to sign over at the grocery store.
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.240]   Yeah, I had to sign.
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.240]   I'd like to do that.
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:54.560]   Well, I think it's card specific.
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:56.040]   It might be merchant specific.
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.880]   I'm not such like, yeah, it should be.
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.680]   You just do that.
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:05.640]   But even then that's such a huge savings in time.
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:09.520]   I feel like it is possible and I'm going to be open minded.
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:13.480]   I'm going to continue to use it that the ecosystem and the apps could make a difference.
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:19.240]   But I also think that there may be a really structural issue, which is it's very hard
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:23.560]   to create a user interface on something this tiny that's functional, that's good, that's
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:24.800]   not fussy.
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:30.280]   This thing has a button, a crown, two buttons, a crown, force touch.
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:33.560]   And you still have to, you know, fump around quite a bit to do something.
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:34.560]   And voice.
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.640]   Yeah, I've been using Siri when it works.
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:38.760]   I was hoping they would have a much bigger screen.
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:41.800]   Other was going to be more like a bangle or just a little bit taller or bigger.
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.200]   I could be a little bit bigger.
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.440]   Who's that guy that has the big watch?
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.440]   A clock around.
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:48.440]   A flavor flame.
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:49.440]   I want to play the flame.
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.440]   I want to play the flame.
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:52.440]   Hi, I'm flavor flame.
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:53.440]   Apple.
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.440]   Apple.
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.720]   The other point is you named a whole ton of watch.
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.640]   You named a pebble, all these other things.
[00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:03.080]   And Jason's big thing is the notifications that easily come and tell you a lot of watch.
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.080]   They all do that.
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.600]   And they aren't mass market adaptable yet.
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:09.400]   People aren't just saying, oh, wow, you're getting SMS on your watch.
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:10.400]   I need one of those.
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:11.400]   Right.
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.400]   People aren't doing that.
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.200]   And the bubble we live in, that's what I think.
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.000]   Oh, this is the best way to go.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   That's what I think.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.200]   People don't look at a wear or an app phone.
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.440]   They're like, oh, so I can get an Uber alert?
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:23.440]   What's Uber?
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:24.600]   I live in a regular town.
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.600]   I don't know what Uber is.
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.200]   So I mean, that's why I don't think you're going to have the sales figures that you were
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.200]   quoting, Jason.
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.200]   So here's the thing.
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.880]   Because normal people, yes, our group will, but normal people are not.
[00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.120]   I agree with you 100% of that.
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:39.480]   You're going to see a social product arrive for this, like an Instagram or a Snapchat.
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.960]   That'll be made for this.
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.200]   And we just haven't seen it yet.
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:46.000]   You're going to see a game like Clash of Clans or Solitaire was for Windows.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   Remember that.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   We just haven't seen it yet.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.800]   Mark Bower does not actually allow animation on this.
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:54.840]   The only way you can have anything at all like animation is with the slideshow.
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:58.400]   There are some severe limitations to doing anything compelling on this right now.
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.640]   But it's pretty clear that the apps you can write now, which are really more like front
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:04.480]   ends for an app, and then your phone or a stopgap.
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:05.680]   And at some point, there will be--
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:06.680]   Somebody might solve it.
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:08.480]   There will be full blown apps on this.
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.560]   And at that point, that much more powerful.
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:11.560]   I'll be doing my old friend.
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:13.560]   You'll also have an Apple Watch.
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.800]   You'll also have an Apple Watch, which does not require your phone to be there because
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.160]   it'll have a connection.
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.640]   That's right.
[00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.080]   That is going to be the app killer.
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:22.920]   Those things in the future might mean something.
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:23.920]   Yeah.
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:26.240]   Oh, apps that magically make people excited.
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.240]   Sure.
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.240]   And Wi-Fi on my phone.
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:29.240]   Okay, those things sound better.
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.840]   But the world we're living in right now, we have to wait and say, I guess.
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:32.840]   Yeah.
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:36.400]   And it's true that on any platform, a killer app is what is going to make the difference.
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:37.400]   Right.
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.480]   My position is I'm wondering what that killer app could possibly be.
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:42.040]   People have the same position with the iPhone.
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:43.920]   People were like, well, what's this big screen for?
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:44.920]   And then once the navigation showed up--
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:45.920]   But multi-touch--
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:50.920]   --I have to say, when you first used multi-touch, a light bulb did go on, didn't it?
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:51.920]   Yeah.
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:55.680]   Even on the first iPhone, which was very limited, had no app store, multi-touch was kind of a
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:56.680]   revelation.
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:59.360]   It's like, ah, oh, I don't need a keyboard anymore.
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:03.880]   I can do this and I can use multiple-- I don't know what the multi-touch is for this.
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:07.840]   And I have to say, what's very obvious is how much thought this was put into this.
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:11.600]   You could see with the activity thing that Jay Blonick, the Nike guy, was spending a
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.480]   lot of time, will do circles.
[00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:14.480]   It'll do this.
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:15.480]   You'll get a little star.
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:18.360]   There clearly is years of thought that went into this.
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:22.960]   And that's why I may be a little discouraged that if even with all of the brains that Apple
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:26.840]   threw at this for years, they weren't able to come up with that compelling app.
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.960]   I'm wondering if that compelling app even exists.
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:33.680]   Someone in the chat room said, the iPhone solved the problem.
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:35.320]   This watch doesn't solve a problem.
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.320]   Exactly.
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.320]   It's in luxury.
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:38.880]   I'm worried about-- I think you're right.
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:41.360]   I think it will sell well among certain groups like us.
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:43.760]   We all five have.
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:44.760]   That's kind of amazing.
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:47.560]   I mean, the activity tracking alone, I think, is a major win.
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:51.240]   I've been using this basis one and it really has changed my behavior.
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.520]   I try to every day, hit my steps.
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:54.680]   I try to hit my run club.
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.080]   The Fitbit did that.
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:57.080]   Yeah.
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:00.720]   And I think that those changed behavior now, if a company like Apple can make it elegant
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:06.040]   and compatible with the iPhone in a very easy way without setup, that alone, if they
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:11.720]   get some people hooked on it, that could be an entire category health book that really,
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:13.840]   really compels people to buy, just to get healthier.
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:18.280]   I do agree with that, because I had the jawbone and I had the Fitbit and I made myself stop
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:21.000]   using both of them, because I was waiting for them to watch to come.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.320]   And apparently Apple Watch, by all tests, is more accurate than all of those devices
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:26.320]   also.
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:27.320]   But the software sucks.
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:30.680]   I have to say, I'm super disappointed in their health kit so far.
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:35.480]   And I really hope that basis or Fitbit will use this as an input.
[00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:40.960]   That would be killer if you could use any of the other apps with the Apple Watch as the
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.720]   input to give that data.
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:45.000]   Okay, that's just sort of like a middle man.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.480]   The interface is terrible.
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:50.600]   But it's a great station for stuff to be coming in and coming in and going out and going
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:51.600]   out.
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:52.600]   The other point.
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:54.320]   It's a first gen for its interface.
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:58.200]   And I think that they're going to get better as they realize how people interact with it.
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:01.920]   Plus Apple fans are just huge fans of their products.
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:07.640]   And we're talking about over 250 million user base of people that have iPhone 5s and 6s.
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:11.280]   We're talking about 2% and we've already hit our 5 million.
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:15.440]   We're going to be, I think that 2% of Apple users are going to weigh over that percentage.
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:18.280]   You're going to be ending up getting an Apple Watch test.
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.280]   These are going to be bundled by Christmas.
[00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:26.680]   Yeah, it's going to be pretty easy, I think, to hit huge numbers for Apple, you know.
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.800]   And then we'll have to see where it goes from there.
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:32.960]   The other thing I came away with is how brilliant Apple is in two things, design and marketing.
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:33.960]   It is beautiful.
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:37.000]   I mean, you have two of the best designers in the world, Andy.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.240]   I don't know who Andy is.
[00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:40.160]   Johnny Ive and Mark Newsom.
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:43.080]   And I think they've done a very, I mean, given that they had to make it thick enough to put
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.760]   a battery in, they've done a very good job of design.
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:46.760]   It feels good.
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:47.760]   It looks good.
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:48.760]   The OLED screen is spectacular.
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:49.760]   There are a million clever.
[00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:53.000]   Like each band is clever in a different way in terms of how it connects.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   On the other hand.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.600]   I don't like the crown.
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:00.120]   When the Apple iPhone came out, they had lapped.
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:01.280]   They lapped everybody in the business.
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:03.520]   There was nobody even close, right?
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.480]   I don't feel like that's the case today.
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:10.760]   I think that in fact, Android Wear is pretty darn close and could easily keep up, look
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:14.360]   at what Apple's done and say, oh, we can do that and we can best it.
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:16.200]   So it's going to be, that's good for consumers.
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.560]   That's going to mean there's going to be a lot of choice and it's not just going to
[00:19:18.560 --> 00:19:19.560]   be on iOS.
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:25.240]   Although Apple has a huge advantage on iOS and that they can establish a much more robust
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:31.040]   and sophisticated connection between the phone and the watch than Pebble or anybody else.
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.040]   I agree on iOS.
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.040]   On iOS.
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:37.160]   But an Android Wear watch can do much more with Android than any because of course,
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.440]   Android is much more open.
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:41.320]   And it can talk to all Google services, which it does.
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:42.320]   Yeah.
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:45.840]   So I agree, Android Wear, even though it is coming to iOS, just as Pebble, it will never
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:49.280]   really be a full peer as Apple watches to iOS.
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:53.480]   On the other hand, if you're an Android user, I would say don't feel left out.
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:57.280]   You're going to be just fine because the Android Wear watches, they're already a second generation
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.080]   is starting to come out.
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:02.200]   I'm going to get the LG or Bain on Wednesday.
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.360]   That's a pretty nice round watch.
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.320]   But does it come in solid gold, Uncle Leo?
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:07.320]   It is gold-ish.
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:08.320]   Solid gold.
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:09.320]   No, not that gold-ish.
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:10.320]   Solid gold.
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:15.480]   You know, it's funny because Jason bought the solid gold watch and then had it plated
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.480]   the look aluminum because he didn't want to be too boydy.
[00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.360]   I didn't want to be too ostentatious here.
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.280]   But if you put his watch on it weighs like four pounds.
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:22.280]   It's amazing.
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.280]   I covered the diamonds and rubber.
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:26.280]   Jason hangs out in rough neighborhoods.
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.280]   He doesn't want to get robbed on the screen.
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:29.880]   I don't get jacked for my billing.
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:33.440]   I've been wearing the Moto 360, which is an LCD screen and does not look half as good
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:34.440]   as the OLED screen.
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.320]   What price would this become?
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.040]   A huge salary, do you think, Leo?
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.040]   250.
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:40.040]   No, maybe not huge.
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:41.040]   199?
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.040]   199, yeah.
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.000]   Because he said it costs 80 bucks to make.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.280]   By the way, Tim Cook and his analysts call said, "I hate it when people say how much it
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:49.920]   costs for us to make."
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:50.920]   He hates it for two reasons.
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:52.960]   One, because you see the profit margins.
[00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:58.080]   Two, he says because you can't possibly, we don't use off the shelf components.
[00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:04.120]   So you can't tell me that you know how much my special VLSI CPU costs because I make it
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:05.120]   and you don't.
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:06.120]   Right.
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:07.120]   Or the Taptic Engine.
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:08.920]   By the way, okay, Taptic.
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:10.560]   It's just a freaking vibrator.
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:14.000]   It is not, this is Apple's marketing skill.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.400]   The engine is a Taptic Engine that will make your wrist feel as if somebody's touching.
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.400]   No, it's just a vibrator.
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:21.960]   It's a Haptic Vibrator.
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.560]   It's a normal vibration.
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:27.080]   It's not, I thought maybe it was going to feel like left, right or ghostly touches or
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:28.080]   no.
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:29.080]   It's just a buzz.
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:30.080]   Am I wrong?
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.080]   It's a softer buzz.
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:36.480]   It's a slower oscillation which causes less of a shocking buzz.
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:40.200]   You guys are really in the reality of the distortion field.
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:44.240]   If you think this is anything but a buzz, and by the way, you can hear it.
[00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.240]   Other people can hear it.
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:46.680]   Yes, you can hear it for sure.
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.400]   It is not an invisible tap on your wrist.
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:50.600]   It sounds like a buzz.
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:53.920]   And I can hear it when you're buzzing, so stop it.
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.000]   They did oversell that a bit.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   They oversold it.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   And they sold it.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   That's what they do.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   That's what they do.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.520]   They find new words for everything.
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:03.560]   The intersection between humanity and technology.
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:06.440]   The Taptic Engine is the thinnest, like it's...
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:07.440]   That's good.
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.440]   They're good.
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:09.440]   They're marketing wizards.
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:10.440]   They received jobs.
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:11.440]   It was brilliant at.
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:14.760]   There's one new thing though, for the interface, the force touch, which I don't think people
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.280]   even know about.
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:18.640]   I have the MacBook Pro with the...
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.040]   It has the force touch, yeah.
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.880]   It is kind of weird because when it's off, you can tell.
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:23.880]   That's a one piece.
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:24.880]   There's no clicking at all.
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:26.560]   You turn it on and suddenly you feel clicking.
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:28.440]   It's like, what happened?
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.200]   That is, that does fool you.
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:31.680]   But on the watch, does it?
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:32.680]   I don't know.
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:33.680]   You know, the watch does do one thing.
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:35.000]   I wish the iPhone did.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.040]   You could force touch notifications and clear them all at once.
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.040]   Oh, it does.
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.840]   You can't do that on the iPhone.
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:41.840]   Yeah.
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:42.840]   You have to one by one.
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:43.840]   Oh my God, you're right.
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:44.840]   It's the worst thing ever.
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:45.840]   That's genius.
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:49.920]   They've had on every other phone for five years.
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:51.480]   But Apple did it.
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:52.480]   It's genius.
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:53.480]   Genius now.
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:54.920]   So you get all your notifications.
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:57.080]   You force touch, well actually I'm not in the...
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:58.080]   You hold it down.
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.080]   I mean, I got to screw it.
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:00.880]   For people who don't know what force touch is, it means you push it really hard.
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:01.880]   You push it hard.
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:02.880]   And you don't let go.
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:03.880]   That's another word.
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:05.400]   Look, it's called pressure sensitive, right?
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:06.400]   Yeah.
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:09.360]   And the problem is that you don't know when you can and can't do that until you try and
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:10.680]   it either does or doesn't do anything.
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.120]   It's kind of like Windows 8 in that regard.
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:13.120]   It has magical incantations.
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.400]   It's like a right clip.
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:17.400]   You don't know what you're yet until you try it.
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:18.400]   Right.
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.040]   It is pretty closely analogous to the right click.
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:21.040]   Yes.
[00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:22.200]   It is the right click of...
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.200]   Okay, just which...
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:26.000]   I have this is the simple watch face or utility watch face.
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   Which one are you using?
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   I have.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   You have Mickey.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.160]   By the way, oh we got to try this.
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.160]   Wait a minute.
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:32.160]   How come they don't...
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:33.760]   Everybody put your watch face on Mickey.
[00:23:33.760 --> 00:23:35.560]   Oh, do I have to?
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:37.360]   No, you don't have to because you're not in the room.
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:38.360]   It won't work.
[00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:40.320]   But I want to just see if...
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:45.480]   So all three of the people in the room put it on Mickey and then let's see if Mickey's
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.000]   tap toe tapping is...
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   They said it would be in synchronous synchronization.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   No, we're going to go in.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   Okay, take it off.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   You have to take it off.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.480]   We're going to put them all in one spot.
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:55.080]   We're going to put them side by side.
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:56.400]   This is a very...
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:57.400]   This is...
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:58.400]   Oh crap.
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:23:59.400]   You know what they...
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:00.400]   Now you got to do it on camera.
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:01.400]   Hold it like this and do your pen code.
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:02.400]   Oh crap.
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.400]   Cover your pen code.
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.400]   Who cares if you don't have my pen code?
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.400]   So what?
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:06.400]   What are you going to do?
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.400]   You know my freaking pen code.
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.400]   Oh my God.
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.400]   Do your pen code.
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.960]   You're going to take all my money out of my bank.
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:13.440]   I'm going to take all your money.
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:14.440]   Oh wait a minute.
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:15.440]   Yep, yep.
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:16.440]   It looks like it's insane.
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:17.440]   Oh my God, it is insane.
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:18.440]   Oh my.
[00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:19.440]   Oh we just need one more to really prove this.
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:20.440]   One more.
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.440]   So tap it.
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:22.440]   Okay, one more.
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.440]   Oh crap.
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:24.440]   Oh no.
[00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:25.440]   Oh.
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:28.440]   That's like two grand where the watch is right there.
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:29.880]   We're careful.
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.880]   I think he's in sync.
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:35.520]   I don't know why that excites me.
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:37.480]   You need to loosen up your bow side.
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:38.480]   How come there aren't more.
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:41.800]   Oh that yell and the bow side is getting tighter and tighter every time you get to shriek
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.000]   and I feel for you.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   Am I turning red?
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.840]   There's still watch face story yet though, right?
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:47.840]   No.
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:48.840]   I will never be.
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.920]   I'll tell you what happened to Oh doctor.
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:51.920]   Are you in the doctor?
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:54.400]   I got skylights, the sunset and all of me.
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.360]   I don't know what's going on.
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:57.360]   I love that you have your glasses on.
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:59.720]   This looks like an episode of Homeland all of a sudden.
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:00.720]   Oh.
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:01.720]   He's playing solo land.
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:02.720]   I'm so worried.
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:03.720]   We're talking to his llama bod.
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:04.720]   Exactly.
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:05.720]   Oh it's winter time.
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:06.960]   It's nighttime so I have my lights and stuff.
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:07.960]   I'm like so bright.
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:08.960]   I don't need lights.
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.600]   Not a sun's right in my face.
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:11.600]   You don't like it for a minute.
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:12.600]   Wait a minute.
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:14.080]   We buried the lead.
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:17.640]   Georgia Dow you don't like Mickey Mouse?
[00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:19.320]   I really don't like Mickey Mouse.
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:20.320]   Oh my god.
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:21.320]   Is that a creepy?
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:22.320]   Is he like creepy clown creepy?
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:23.680]   No, it's oh I don't know.
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:24.680]   It's just.
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.760]   What's the last time Mickey had a good head?
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:27.760]   There's too much hype with Mickey.
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.080]   I'm like I'm so done with that.
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:33.920]   But it is interesting because remember Disney is not owned by Apple despite appearances.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.080]   They're very good friends though.
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:36.080]   They're very close.
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.280]   What's the Pixar connection?
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:43.040]   And Lorraine Jobs is in fact the largest stockholder Disney but this is still a license deal.
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:48.120]   Why don't they have a store with a hundred different options yet?
[00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:50.840]   By from Apple or from third parties?
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:52.400]   Well never get third parties.
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.400]   You can't do that.
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:57.760]   I was impressed by the degree to watch the ones they have are customizable.
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:58.760]   You can get a lot of.
[00:25:58.760 --> 00:25:59.760]   I like the way you can customize it.
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:00.760]   Features out of the ones they have.
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:01.760]   Yeah that kind of solves my mind.
[00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:05.520]   I assume there will be additional Apple ones and the only question is whether there
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:07.280]   will ever be ones from third parties.
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:08.560]   All right we've done it again.
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:13.120]   I don't know why but the Apple watch has consumed many many hours of programming on the Twitter.
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:14.560]   It's in the category it's worth it.
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:17.440]   But it's true when the iPad came out we spent a lot of time talking about the iPad when
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:20.080]   the iPhone came out we spent a lot of time talking about the iPhone means just the way
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:21.080]   it is.
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:24.920]   I tell you what this watch didn't change the world like somebody else did this week.
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:28.040]   Who else changed the world all in JJ Stone?
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:29.040]   Mr. Musk.
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.480]   Mr. Elon Musk.
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:31.480]   For sure he did.
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:32.480]   Let's talk about Tesla.
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:33.480]   He changed the world.
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.480]   One of the power wall.
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:35.480]   Coming up next.
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:38.600]   Elon Musk is like our own Tony Stark.
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:39.600]   We love him.
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:47.200]   You know I'm sitting here the announcement was at was at 830 Pacific time which is 1130
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:51.160]   East Coast time and I'm sitting I'm watching they're playing the same two crappy trance
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:53.720]   songs over and over and over and over.
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:58.240]   I even tried on Shazam on my watch and on my phone to figure out what they are.
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:04.120]   They're like production music and I tweeted apparently Elon's having trouble getting the
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:05.120]   Iron Man suit on.
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:06.120]   Okay.
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:07.440]   That was the big joke of the week now.
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:10.880]   Let's take a break and come back power wall.
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:16.640]   We will talk about a giant battery that is the changing the world says on JJ Stone.
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:18.040]   Great cast today.
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:20.280]   The return of Jason Callicannis to Twitter.
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:21.280]   Everyone.
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:22.280]   Oh my God.
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:23.280]   Siri was listening.
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:24.280]   Twitter is blowing up.
[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:25.280]   Siri was listening.
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:27.080]   It's got my entire last.
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:28.520]   Oh my God.
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:29.520]   Look at that.
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:30.520]   That's pretty good.
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:31.520]   Oh my the transcript.
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:32.520]   Oh he's got the transcript.
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:33.520]   It does continue us now.
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:35.320]   It's a show and then she says sorry Leo.
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:38.800]   Can you try that again in fewer words?
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:41.640]   Everybody's a critic.
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:45.080]   Owen JJ Stone is here from New Jersey.
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:46.840]   Somebody in the chat room said I'm laughing Baltimore.
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:52.000]   I think I might have to be careful with that.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.680]   The technology I was hearing about crack in the return of Jason Callic.
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:55.680]   How long has it been?
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:56.680]   A couple years.
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:57.680]   I'm sorry.
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:58.680]   Don't worry about it again.
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:27:59.680]   Listen.
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:01.320]   It's built up all this energy now.
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:02.320]   It's good.
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:03.320]   We're going up.
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:04.780]   What is going on?
[00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:08.120]   And Georgia Dow and people have been saying we got to get Georgia on Twitter for years.
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:09.720]   And finally I got around to doing it.
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:11.520]   So we have you too from iMore.com.
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:15.560]   Our show today brought to you by those good people at Carbonite.
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:20.320]   You know it's National Small Business Week this week.
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:24.520]   There are no such thing as small businesses, only small bides.
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:25.520]   Small people.
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:26.520]   Even a small business like this.
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:27.560]   This is a small business.
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:29.520]   It needs good backup.
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:33.280]   Carbonite for home or office is the best way to protect your data.
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:39.560]   And the cloud so that if there's a fire, a flood, you get an earthquake tsunami.
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:43.360]   Whatever happens, you don't lose your business.
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:48.480]   I mean if all your backups are sitting next to your computer and the place burns down,
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:50.560]   you've lost your receivables.
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:52.880]   You've lost your client list, your suppliers list.
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:54.960]   How do you get back in business?
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:55.960]   You need carbonite.
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:59.080]   You need cloud backup and carbonite is easy, especially for a small business where you don't
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:00.520]   have an IT department.
[00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:06.160]   It's easy to set up 75,000 small businesses use carbonite for their data.
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:09.880]   More than a million and a half folks all over the world use carbonite.
[00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:13.040]   For the hands-on business owner, it makes it hands-free.
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:15.560]   Backup is hands-free and hassle-free.
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:19.640]   And right now during National Small Business Week, a special deal when you go to Carbonite.com.
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:20.940]   Here's the deal.
[00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:22.100]   Try it.
[00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:23.100]   That's the best thing.
[00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:28.040]   And I love our sponsors who say try it for free because then you can see if it works for
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:29.040]   you.
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:35.360]   You see offer code TWIT and get that round-the-clock protection and two free bonus months.
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:38.600]   As long as you say, "I heard it," on TWIT, carbonite.
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:41.120]   You gotta back it up to get it back so do it right.
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:44.560]   Their tagline should be, "It was good enough for Han."
[00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:46.160]   Good enough for Han.
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:49.080]   How long was Han in carbonite?
[00:29:49.080 --> 00:29:52.680]   Do we know that?
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:53.680]   I don't know.
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:54.680]   Was it between eps--
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:55.680]   How long was it?
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:30:01.320]   That was it, Robin.
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:02.640]   See, Siri's not listening to me.
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:03.840]   She listens when she wants.
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:04.840]   Hey, Siri.
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:05.840]   Hey, Siri.
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:06.840]   Hey, how long?
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:07.840]   How long?
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:08.840]   You talk in your hand like that's why you look like weirdos.
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:09.840]   You look like a weirdos.
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:10.840]   You look like a weirdos.
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:11.840]   I'm in carbonite.
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:12.840]   I know.
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:13.840]   I know.
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:14.840]   I know.
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:16.840]   Remember when people used to just talk with your piece then?
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:19.000]   And you thought that they looked insane?
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.240]   How long was Han in carbonite?
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:22.240]   Wow, that was easy.
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:31.240]   By the way, Georgia, how do you stand on the Star Wars?
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:36.360]   Are you an original episode four or do you like the Blu-ray version?
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.960]   Have you downloaded all six digital episodes?
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:40.520]   Where do you stand on that?
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:43.320]   Well, my husband's a huge fan, so I've had to watch them a million times.
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:47.760]   I like the original and in my Star Wars hand, shoots first.
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:48.960]   Uh-huh.
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:49.960]   That's the key.
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:50.960]   No brainer.
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:51.960]   No brainer.
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:52.960]   If you say "Hunchup" first...
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:56.960]   If you say "Hunchup" first then we know that you're not the...
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:31:00.040]   Because George Lucas for some reason wants to change at all.
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:01.040]   I don't know why.
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:03.280]   Yeah, well, JJ Abrams is going to crush it on his head.
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:04.280]   It's going to be good, isn't it?
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:05.280]   It's amazing.
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:07.720]   You can just tell he's like doing the real models.
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:11.720]   So if you look at a film like Blade Runner or the original Star Wars, it's so believable
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:12.720]   because the models were real.
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:18.520]   And once you have this like everything CGI, I think the actors can't act well in it.
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:19.520]   And I don't think it looks real.
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:23.600]   So when you look back to the models and full-scale models, the Millennium Falcon, it's easier
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:24.880]   for them to act.
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:26.120]   And he nailed Star Trek.
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:27.120]   Like he hit Star Trek.
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:28.120]   He did, I think he did.
[00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:29.320]   Best Star Trek's ever.
[00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:31.600]   I went on Star Trek and I felt like a kid.
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:32.600]   I was proud.
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:33.600]   Like I made it.
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:34.600]   Like he was my son.
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:36.080]   I'm like my son made Star Trek.
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:40.160]   And I don't even know JJ Abrams, so I believe in his powerful...
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.160]   But have you seen BB-8?
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:43.160]   Look at this guy.
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:44.520]   It's based on this Firo.
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:45.920]   It's made by Firo, right?
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:46.920]   It's made by Firo, yeah.
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:50.080]   Am I the only one that's going to be getting one when they come out?
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.640]   Oh, everybody's going to get one.
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:52.640]   I signed up.
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:54.240]   Firo is actually going to sell him.
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:55.240]   I signed up immediately.
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:56.520]   Will it have the top though?
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:57.520]   The top piece too?
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:58.520]   Yeah.
[00:31:58.520 --> 00:31:59.520]   Oh wow.
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:02.720]   So Firo, if you didn't see it, it's funny because they've been like all the expos and
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:04.640]   CES for years.
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:09.080]   It's kind of a dorky game where the ball rolls itself and you control it with an iPhone.
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:11.680]   And we've all played it and they have Firo, soccer and stuff.
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.320]   And I have some somewhere in the basement.
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:15.360]   We have some Firo's.
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:19.240]   So it didn't really take off until they're huge.
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:22.040]   And this is going to be the toy of Christmas.
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:23.040]   You passed on investing?
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:26.640]   Well, I saw it like two years ago and I was like, I'm not an investor in toys.
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:27.640]   Yeah.
[00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:30.640]   And I don't understand how this is going to become a huge business and they were struggling.
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:32.440]   And now it's going to become huge.
[00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:33.440]   But this is going to kill it.
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:34.440]   It's going to be a mess.
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:35.440]   It's a robot.
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:36.440]   The bottom ball is independent.
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:38.080]   It looks like a snowman.
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:39.400]   The bottom ball is independent of the head.
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:40.960]   The head is held on by magnets.
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:41.960]   It's incredible.
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:45.440]   There is a rod in the lower ball that actually moves the head around.
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:48.040]   Of course, the head could spin independently.
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:51.800]   But the reason the ball can roll kind of independently is because it's not attached.
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.640]   It's just magnetically held on.
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:54.640]   It is changing.
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:56.640]   What am I going to do with it?
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:59.440]   You know, you're just going to bring around to the ball.
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:03.680]   And make it, it's like one of those great things just to show everyone because that's
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:04.680]   just neat.
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:06.020]   And then it'll sit there forever.
[00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:08.040]   There is a certain irony you want to say.
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:09.120]   This apple, which is stupid.
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:12.680]   But I got to have a robot that rolls on a ball.
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:13.680]   I have to steer.
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:16.480]   I have to do with, I have rug.
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:17.480]   Wow.
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:18.480]   Oh my God.
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:19.480]   Look at that.
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:20.480]   Is that yours or your husband?
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:21.480]   To tell the truth.
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:22.480]   Yeah.
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:23.480]   No, no, this is mine.
[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:24.480]   Oh dear.
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:25.480]   No, no, no.
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:26.480]   This is mine.
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:27.480]   I have to do some serious science experiments with that.
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:29.560]   If I remember the marketing correctly.
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:31.800]   So I need, I need BB.
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:33.480]   I really want to be BB8.
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:34.640]   I don't know how we got into that.
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:37.320]   I wrote a pretty enthusiastic review of a sparrow.
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:41.440]   But I have to admit that after finishing my review, I didn't come back to it.
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:43.920]   No, it was, it was cool.
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:45.200]   But here's the thing.
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:47.600]   I'm playing with it with my seven year old daughter.
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:48.600]   We have two of them.
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:49.600]   We have friends over.
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:50.600]   We make little tracks.
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:51.600]   Oh, you have races.
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:52.600]   We jump and we take them into the pool.
[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:54.840]   Like we do stuff, dog, like y'all are adults.
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:55.840]   Y'all got time for toys.
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:57.640]   Like Jesus said, he didn't want to invest in a toy.
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:58.640]   Y'all don't know about toys.
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:33:59.640]   Give it to some kids.
[00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:00.640]   Share with the world.
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:03.800]   I bought for Christmas last year, not even this 2014, but 2013.
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:05.560]   I bought the Anki drive.
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:06.560]   Those are the cars.
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:07.560]   Oh, yeah, they're amazing.
[00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:10.120]   They were like slot car racing, but there was no slots.
[00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:12.920]   And they could read the track really fast.
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:14.920]   And they'd shoot at each other and stuff.
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:15.920]   I'm just coming.
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:17.520]   I'm reading your garage on the living room.
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:19.320]   You got stuff just sitting in the place.
[00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:20.320]   You got a new--
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:21.320]   Henry, I'm coming.
[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:24.800]   This was expensive because I only bought the basic kit, but I bought two extra cars.
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.560]   I spent a lot of money on this.
[00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:27.800]   And Henry went, yeah, that's nice.
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.920]   And went home and went back to school and that was it.
[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:30.920]   So I have it.
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:31.920]   I'm pretty much daughter over.
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:32.920]   We're going shopping.
[00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:33.920]   I'm over.
[00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:36.720]   I would love to meet your daughter.
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:37.720]   She's awesome.
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:39.120]   She's got to be totally awesome.
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:41.400]   She made me take her-- she does karate, right?
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:42.960]   This week she made me take her to MMA.
[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:43.960]   She saw UFC on TV.
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:45.560]   And she was like, can I do that?
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:46.960]   And I'm like, you want to do that?
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:47.960]   She's like, yeah.
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:50.880]   So I went for the free class and everybody was like, wow, your daughter's a beast.
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:51.880]   And I'm like, yes she is.
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:52.880]   Oh my god.
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:53.880]   How old is she?
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:54.880]   Oh, and you?
[00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:55.880]   She's seven.
[00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:57.640]   Oh, and you have to get your girl.
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:01.200]   You got to get her involved in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:02.200]   She already got the couple.
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:03.200]   She already got the couple.
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:05.800]   She got her-- she has her purple belt in Jiu-Jitsu.
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:06.800]   Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:08.320]   And now she's doing regular karate.
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:09.720]   She's on her orange belt.
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:11.320]   And now she wants to start MMA.
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:14.120]   And she, like I said, she has four punching bag for Christmas.
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:15.120]   That's the kind of door I got.
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:18.040]   So I hope you get her a BB-8 instead.
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:19.040]   She could punch the BB-8.
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:20.040]   Whatever.
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:21.040]   I just want to worry about boys.
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:22.040]   That's all I'm happy about.
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:23.040]   And we're going to come read to you.
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.040]   Oh, you don't have to worry about boys.
[00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:26.880]   Yes, we do not have to worry about boys.
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:28.480]   She got to kick their ass.
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:29.480]   Right?
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:31.480]   Georgia, you're also in the Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu because I know Renee is.
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:32.480]   He almost killed me.
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:33.480]   I saw the video.
[00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:34.480]   New Year's Eve.
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:35.480]   New Year's Eve.
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:36.480]   Yeah.
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:37.480]   That was a great video.
[00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:38.480]   Yeah, I love Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.
[00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:44.600]   I've done martial arts all my life, but Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, it just evens out the odds.
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:46.800]   You don't have to worry about that if Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:47.800]   Everything's good.
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:48.800]   Well, that's it, right?
[00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:52.520]   You use the energy and momentum of your opponent against them.
[00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:56.440]   I'm tiny, but all my body against someone's neck, it's not happening.
[00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:57.440]   Right.
[00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:58.440]   Right.
[00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:00.200]   Now I'm scared.
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:02.680]   Elon Tesla, we were going to, Elon Tesla.
[00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:03.680]   That should be his name.
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:04.960]   Yeah, this should call him Tesla.
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:05.960]   Just call him Tesla.
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:06.960]   Tesla the second.
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:12.920]   Elon Musk, so I'm watching, listening to dad, I gave up, I actually gave up because it was
[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:14.360]   half an hour before it started.
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:17.600]   It was late and I just gave up and now I'm sad because everybody's saying it was a great
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:18.600]   keynote.
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:20.960]   What I saw of it wasn't super polished.
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:22.400]   He was just kind of talking.
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:23.400]   Yeah.
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:24.400]   You didn't watch it?
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:25.400]   You didn't watch it later?
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:26.400]   I did watch it later.
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:27.400]   Okay.
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:29.280]   Would you think it was the greatest tech keynote you've ever seen?
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:30.720]   Let me tell you something about this.
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:33.800]   First of all, everybody's brainwashed by this Apple center lighter better.
[00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:37.800]   To see a regular man get up and give a regular speech and then change the world, I don't
[00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:38.800]   care what he said.
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:39.800]   I don't care when he flubbed.
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:40.800]   I love when he joked.
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:41.800]   He was so free.
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:42.800]   He was real.
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:47.520]   The fact that we could change the world now if we do X, Y, Z and as possible, if you guys
[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:49.320]   help me, I can help you.
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:50.320]   I don't care what he said.
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:51.760]   It was 18 minutes of pure joy.
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:54.720]   I sent it to two of my friends who are basically in huts right now.
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:58.680]   They travel the world helping sick kids in Africa and the other friends in China helping
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:36:59.680]   animals and stuff.
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:02.800]   And my one friend was like, I'm literally crying right now because you don't understand
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:06.760]   the places I go to that have solar power and then they can't have power at night and
[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:08.600]   they can't do any throwing options.
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:10.600]   Like the batteries I keep saying are junk.
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:14.480]   They literally are and people that are in those countries, one day we'll be able to
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:16.280]   have sustained power.
[00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:17.280]   He changed the world.
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:20.080]   Him and his team, everybody, I want to go work for that man.
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:22.040]   I work for that man for free right now.
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:23.320]   I love that man so much.
[00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:25.440]   It is a powerful, powerful thing.
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:26.440]   It's amazing.
[00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:27.440]   And you know what?
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.280]   I'm playing it right here.
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:30.280]   And you know what?
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:31.280]   He's Canadian.
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:33.280]   That's why I saw him nice.
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:34.280]   South.
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:35.280]   Really?
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:36.280]   I thought he was from South Africa.
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:37.280]   It's from South Africa.
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:38.280]   He says he's Canadian.
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:40.480]   I think he came to the coast.
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:41.480]   Really?
[00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:42.480]   I think he just did a little when he landed here.
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:43.480]   I wish.
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:45.280]   He's I was trying to figure out his accent.
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.280]   South African.
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:47.280]   That makes sense.
[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:50.080]   He sounds that South Africans get that boring thing going on.
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:53.120]   What I loved about it was I don't think that it was the greatest keynote.
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:54.880]   I love the same thing that Owen loved.
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:58.720]   I love that it was fresh, that it was honest, that it wasn't filled with market speed.
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:37:59.720]   Right.
[00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:01.040]   That it wasn't something that like a company brought out.
[00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:02.320]   It was just him.
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:03.320]   Something that he believes in.
[00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:04.320]   It was quirky.
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:06.760]   It was awkward, but it was honest.
[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:08.160]   This is one of my favorite pieces.
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:10.760]   Let me back it up just a little bit.
[00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:12.640]   We'll play this.
[00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:15.440]   Can you hear him?
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:16.800]   Why is it so low?
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:17.800]   Why is it so low?
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:20.000]   It turned up all the way.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.200]   Right before that is the best part.
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.000]   What he said, we have this fusion reactor.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   It's free.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   It comes up every day.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.240]   It's called the Sun.
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:30.400]   I thought of every movie I've seen in my lifetime, where it's like James Bond, and they're building
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:31.400]   a fusion reactor.
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:32.800]   None of that crap is real.
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:34.920]   He's just like, "Hey, we got like a free one."
[00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:35.920]   Right.
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:36.920]   The thing is up there.
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:37.920]   We might already have one.
[00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:38.920]   Jason has turned all the way up.
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:39.920]   Is it just me?
[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:40.920]   Jason Hallamaskin.
[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:41.920]   Oh.
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:43.720]   Because it's very quiet.
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:44.960]   It's really not much.
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:45.960]   There it is.
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:46.960]   Most of that...
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:53.960]   So let me back up one more time.
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:56.960]   It's needed to get rid of all fossil fuel electricity generation in the United States.
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:03.120]   That blue square there is the land area that's needed to transition the United States to
[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:06.440]   a zero carbon electricity situation.
[00:39:06.440 --> 00:39:09.240]   That blue square, if that were solar panels...
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:12.040]   Now by the way, that blue square is probably 800 miles by 800 miles.
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:13.040]   It looks small, but it's...
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:14.040]   It's a city.
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:15.200]   It's a city.
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:19.400]   But that would replace all our dependence on foreign fuels on everything.
[00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:21.920]   It would be so.
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:27.320]   And if by the way, that area is about the area of all the roofs in the United States.
[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:29.040]   It's really not much.
[00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:33.040]   And most of that area is going to be in rooftops.
[00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:34.240]   You want me to disturb land.
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:37.080]   You want me to find new areas.
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:39.320]   It's mostly just going to be unexisting.
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:41.600]   The roofs of existing homes and buildings.
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:46.120]   Although the Panhandle of Texas would be a good place to put it.
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:50.440]   There's a lot of places out there that are open that you can get a lot of square space
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:51.440]   out of.
[00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:53.080]   Nevada, I think there's some big solar farms out there.
[00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:55.360]   That's why there's gigalot factor is going to be.
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:59.680]   You want to have a local storage show, which is the whole point of this, because you have
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:03.680]   the peak usage and the dip.
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:09.160]   When we have peak usage in California and the other states, we fire off coal to build
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:12.320]   enough energy for people.
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:16.160]   That's what he's talking about here.
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:18.160]   The energy generation varies.
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:26.960]   There's a lot more energy generated in the middle of the day than a dawn or dusk.
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:29.520]   It's very important to smooth out that energy generation.
[00:40:29.520 --> 00:40:31.320]   There's these big peaks in valley.
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:32.320]   Right.
[00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:37.360]   Even if you just had the battery pack without soldering your house, you could download and
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:38.680]   the grid's getting smart now.
[00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:45.120]   It will tell you electronically over the interwebs, "Hey, energy is cheap now.
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:46.120]   Charge your battery."
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:50.120]   When you have a Tesla, you can set it to charge at 2 AM, 3 AM.
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:53.800]   When you know that the load is low and you get cheap electricity.
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:54.800]   You have a Tesla, right?
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:55.800]   Yeah, it's right outside.
[00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:56.800]   You got the first one.
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:57.800]   That's serial number one.
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:58.800]   You long gave it to me.
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:40:59.800]   That's nice.
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:05.200]   It's a good story behind it.
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:06.200]   You were the first person.
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:07.200]   I knew to get a Tesla.
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:12.080]   What happened was the company was going out of business and I was at dinner with him.
[00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:15.160]   Was this the period where we just now learn Google?
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:16.720]   He was hoping to sell to Google?
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:17.960]   This was even before that.
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:21.760]   When all the trade pubs were saying, "Hey, it's got two weeks or three weeks worth of
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:22.760]   payroll."
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:23.760]   Wow.
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:25.760]   We're out of dinner, just the two of us in LA.
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:27.600]   I said, "Well, certainly there's some good news."
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:29.200]   He's like, "Well, I blew up the second rocket."
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:31.000]   I said, "What happens if you blow up a third rocket?"
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.360]   He goes, "Space sex is done."
[00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:34.640]   I said, "Well, how are you doing?"
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:37.880]   I said, "Well, you know, personally, he was getting divorced from his first wife at that
[00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:38.880]   time."
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:41.160]   I said, "Certainly there must be some good news.
[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:42.320]   Tell me something good that's going on."
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:43.320]   He took out his blackberry.
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:44.320]   That's how old it was.
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:47.360]   He said, "Well, don't tell anybody, but here's the clay model of the--"
[00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:48.360]   The roaster?
[00:41:48.360 --> 00:41:50.200]   "No, the model S."
[00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:51.200]   We had the roasters.
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:53.560]   He showed me the clay model of the sedan.
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:55.000]   I said, "Wow, that's gorgeous.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   What do you think you can get it for?"
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.760]   He said, "Well, don't tell anybody, but I think I can make this for 50 grand."
[00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:01.040]   I went home and I wrote two checks for $50,000.
[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:02.960]   I put him in a FedEx envelope.
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:05.880]   I said, "E, looks like a great car.
[00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:06.880]   I'll take two."
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:08.920]   I told my wife, "We're never going to see this.
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:12.760]   It's going to pay for a couple days of payroll that Tesla's going out of business, but I
[00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:13.760]   have to support my friend."
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:14.760]   That's awesome.
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:19.200]   Two years later, I got-- the checks were cashed and it said, "Congratulations.
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:24.040]   Your serial number reservation is 0001, 0073."
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:26.640]   I forwarded to Elon, and I said, "Elon, you don't have to give me the first one."
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:27.640]   He goes, "I want you to have it.
[00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:29.120]   You ordered it before anybody.
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:30.120]   You deserve it."
[00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:31.120]   That's a great story.
[00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:34.960]   I got it outside and then I was just offered a quarter million dollars for my collector
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:35.960]   twice what I pay for.
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:36.960]   Because it's one.
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:37.960]   It's certainly a certain world.
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:38.960]   I'm going to put it on.
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:40.600]   I'm going to donate it to the Smithsonian or something.
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:41.600]   That is amazing.
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:45.400]   He's a transcendent entrepreneur, obviously.
[00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:48.920]   What you see here, what I loved about this keynote was he was going up there talking
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:53.080]   about not his business, but the problem that the world faces.
[00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:57.920]   99% of the keynote was, "Hey, everybody's denying climate change.
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:42:59.600]   Here is the chart of carbon.
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:02.360]   Here is a solution that will work."
[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:06.160]   He's trying to explain to people who are in climate denial and who believe that the world
[00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:10.720]   cannot solve its own problems and saying, "You can't solve your problems."
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:16.120]   If we put out 200 million of these in the world, we can get everybody off of fossil
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:17.280]   fuel.
[00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:18.280]   It is possible.
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:21.520]   To give you an idea, if we put a billion of these in the world, we put a billion cars
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:26.200]   out in the world, every two billion cars in the world, like every 20 years.
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:29.440]   We can do this in our lifetime and we can make carbon go sideways.
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:35.480]   This was a pitch to stop climate change, not a pitch for his own bankroll.
[00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:36.480]   That's what we're going to do.
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:39.680]   It would be like if Steve Jobs got on stage and was like, "Hey, the reason we're going
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:44.160]   to get these watches is because if we have everybody's health data, we can help everybody
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:48.120]   with that big data cure cancer eventually because we'll have everybody's data."
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:49.120]   This was transcended.
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:50.120]   It wasn't about him.
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:51.120]   It was about climate change.
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:54.040]   When I say change the world, I mean change the world.
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:57.560]   Literally when you get to those points that Jason just pointed out and he also said, "I
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:58.560]   can't do it alone.
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:01.040]   I would love for other companies to come in here and help me."
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:04.760]   Now, how many of these companies are going to sit around like Blockbuster looking at Netflix
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:07.040]   saying, "Oh, well, nobody's going to want that.
[00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:08.040]   That doesn't matter."
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:10.680]   The next thing you know, the ramp up and you're like, "Wow, nobody's really coming into
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:13.400]   the store and why is the grid not produces much power as these two?"
[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:16.200]   Oh, because people are getting these batteries and the next thing you know, they're left
[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:19.080]   out in the dust because somebody else is doing it.
[00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:23.920]   I hope that God, the people get behind this and that for some reason, the older dinosaur
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:28.640]   part-parts of the world think about the future and change things because he literally said,
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:30.600]   "Hey, it's open source technology.
[00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:31.600]   Help me do it.
[00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:32.600]   Help me change the world.
[00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:33.600]   Here's how we do it."
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:36.600]   He gave you a plan of blueprint and he's given it to you on a platter.
[00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:37.600]   Let's go.
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:39.320]   I want to talk specific.
[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:42.040]   What he's selling is a house size.
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:43.520]   It's not a house size, but it's a battery.
[00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:46.240]   Suitable for powering a house is called Powerwall.
[00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:48.360]   It is not that big.
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:49.960]   It's a small refrigerator.
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:51.960]   Maybe it's thinner than that.
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:55.440]   It's only 9 inches deep or something like that.
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:56.440]   It's lithium-ion batteries.
[00:44:56.440 --> 00:45:00.520]   It's the same batteries from the Tesla because the whole floorboard of the Tesla is a battery
[00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:01.520]   pack.
[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:04.120]   I've heard stories that people have actually taken their Teslas apart for the batteries.
[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:05.720]   Yeah, you put the battery on the wall like this.
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:06.720]   Boom.
[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:07.720]   That's what he basically made was.
[00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:08.720]   He took the Tesla technology and put it there.
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:13.120]   What's really interesting is the story arc for Elon was when he was storing SpaceX, he
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:16.840]   started bringing in metal into this side of the factory.
[00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:18.320]   I remember him touring me.
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:20.840]   This is the metal we're going to use to make that rocket.
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:22.040]   Then he had a machine in between.
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:23.480]   That's going to press it.
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:28.400]   Then when he did Tesla, he took those same lessons he learned and put it to Tesla to
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:29.400]   build a car.
[00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:32.760]   When you go to the Tesla factory, materials come in here, car comes out there.
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:35.160]   He's not making any of the parts from somebody else.
[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:38.920]   By the way, that's what Henry Ford did with the Rouge factory.
[00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:42.320]   Box cars pulled up with timber and iron or Coke.
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:43.320]   It would make a car.
[00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:44.520]   It would come out the other end.
[00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:47.760]   The only thing that he was supplying, the true things he was supplying from other places
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:51.720]   was the steering column was from Mercedes.
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:55.120]   I don't think it is in the next one.
[00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:58.440]   But the batteries he was getting from China.
[00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:01.000]   I remember him telling him, "They're not going to be able to make enough batteries
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   for me.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   I've got to make my own battery."
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.680]   That's what the Gigafactory came in.
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:09.920]   Because one of the things that's happened is the stock price of Tesla has appreciated
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:14.520]   so much that he's been able to use that to take on bigger projects like the Gigafactory.
[00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:17.680]   The Gigafactory is going to produce batteries for everything.
[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:19.600]   There's wall battery idea.
[00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:23.360]   It could change everything because if you store that electricity local and you've got
[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:27.520]   10% of people to do that, we might not have to fire up the coal plants.
[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:34.160]   We might be able to stick with nuclear, hydro, and the cleaner choices.
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:37.520]   If you think it's impossible in Germany, they're phasing out nuclear and they've had
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:40.040]   days when they've been 60, 70% renewables.
[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:43.200]   Now, these are weekend days, whatever.
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:49.720]   You have France, which is 90% nuclear, and then you have Germany, which is 30% to 70%
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:50.720]   renewables.
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:51.720]   This can happen in the United States.
[00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:55.520]   We're going to get to the point where we'll have either free or close to free electricity.
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:59.680]   If we do that, desalination is currently running at a penny a gallon.
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:04.000]   There's new nanotechnology, basically mesh filters, where water can get pushed through
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.400]   because desalination is just about energy.
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:10.000]   The energy to push it through these nanothing is going to go down to a tenth of a penny per
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   gallon.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:15.560]   If that happens, if we can have the solar and the batteries and a decentralized grid, we
[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:20.080]   could be sucking the water out of the Pacific Ocean and we could make the deserts into
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:21.080]   oasis.
[00:47:21.080 --> 00:47:23.520]   The whole world is going to change our lifetime.
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:24.520]   This is the first step.
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:29.200]   This is going to be part of the legacy that Elon has is going to solve all these problems.
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:33.680]   I'm a techno optimist, but mainly because of my friendship with Elon and seeing him do
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:38.840]   it, he does not have the fear gene.
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:39.840]   He has the courage.
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:40.840]   People don't understand.
[00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:43.120]   Zero fear in the man.
[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:48.480]   I saw him on the brink of a nervous breakdown, and he's told the story publicly about how
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:51.200]   he almost had a nervous breakdown during all this.
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:56.080]   He was living off a loan from one of our famous billionaire friends, and then he told
[00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:58.800]   that story publicly recently.
[00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:00.280]   He brought it all back.
[00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:04.480]   To have $200 million in personal wealth, shove it all into two companies, be living off
[00:48:04.480 --> 00:48:13.400]   a loan from your friend, and then come back from that.
[00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:26.960]   I wonder if I should learn how to play high stakes, but he's a very funny guy.
[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:30.960]   I think what I like about his talk here is you're starting to see his humor.
[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:32.640]   He's actually coming out of his shell a little bit.
[00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:35.120]   This is the Elon you know a little bit better than we are.
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:38.480]   It's definitely the Elon I know because he was making jokes about putting his pinky up
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:40.400]   when he'd say billion and stuff like that.
[00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:41.960]   I kind of liked what I saw.
[00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:42.960]   He's a funny guy.
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:43.960]   I remember I was unplugged in a way.
[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:44.960]   You know it's rarely our anymore.
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:45.960]   He was unplugged.
[00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:46.960]   That's a good phrase.
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:47.960]   You know it's our over-produced.
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:49.440]   They went to the build keynotes.
[00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:51.840]   They had like 27 people on stage.
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:55.240]   There's almost nobody even tries to pull off a keynote by themselves anymore.
[00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:58.800]   Even Steve Jobs for many years would bring a whole bunch of other people on stage.
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:03.880]   He heavily rehearsed for weeks and never strays off the prompter.
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:06.800]   But this is kind of Lucy Goosey's talking.
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:08.680]   His credibility is built too.
[00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:10.320]   That's the thing that's going to be great.
[00:49:10.320 --> 00:49:18.720]   So let's talk about this thing is $3,500 this Powerwall battery to the installer.
[00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:21.960]   How does this work for the end user?
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:25.880]   Do I need to install a solar array in my backyard or does it matter?
[00:49:25.880 --> 00:49:26.880]   It doesn't matter.
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:27.880]   I mean you put solar in you would charge for solar.
[00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:28.880]   I would like to do that.
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:30.720]   It's going to be off the grid.
[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:34.680]   And then when you have these things like I was just texting with you on the night.
[00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:37.760]   I was like if we have another New York situation where New York lost power for three or four
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:40.600]   days, everybody in that city is going to put one of these in.
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:42.360]   And so that's going to be the tipping point.
[00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:44.040]   And nobody really got this on Thursday night.
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:45.240]   Isn't it too expensive to do that?
[00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:46.720]   I mean that's a lot of money.
[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:50.680]   No, $3,500 if you own a house that's worth the average home in these major cities is now
[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:51.680]   to $3 million.
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:52.680]   You're talking about one percent.
[00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:54.880]   Is it the issue though the payoff cost of it?
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:59.080]   I mean the people looking at the cost, you know my power bill is so much and this is
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:00.080]   going to cost so much.
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:01.920]   It's going to take 30 years to pay off.
[00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:02.920]   20 or 30 years to pay off.
[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:03.920]   But think about this.
[00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:07.080]   How many people do you know who are putting backup generators in or buying a backup generator
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:10.240]   from Home Depot for 600 bucks?
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:11.600]   That's like what I was going to say.
[00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:15.440]   There are people that are in struck areas in this country where there are storms, there's
[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:19.720]   outages that would want something like this because one it's fixated.
[00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:23.360]   You know what it is a generator or a generator could go bad in a different way.
[00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:25.320]   You have to have them outside your house.
[00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:26.320]   They cause fires.
[00:50:26.320 --> 00:50:29.760]   There's all kinds of other problems with those kind of generators and backup systems that
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:30.760]   you have currently.
[00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:33.640]   And if you did have solar, great you're going to get free power.
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:40.200]   If you don't and you're in Alaska or somewhere down south or in the wooded area or off grid
[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:44.200]   anyway, this is where that's going to start and then it'll expand out.
[00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:45.200]   It'll also be peaceful.
[00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:47.600]   I love that feeling of being in control of themselves.
[00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:51.440]   I think that that makes them feel much more empowered so that you're controlling the electricity
[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:54.800]   that you deal with and you're helping out the environment at the same time.
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:57.120]   It's not just about monetary gain.
[00:50:57.120 --> 00:51:01.120]   So I think that people will enjoy being able to do it all themselves and producing their
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:04.800]   own electricity and if they can, being able to give back to the system.
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:06.680]   How long would this keep me with power?
[00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:07.680]   Is it a day?
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:08.680]   Is it a half a day?
[00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:11.880]   It's a couple of hours I think it really depends on if you have your dryer, your dryer
[00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:14.080]   and your washing machine and your dishwasher.
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:15.080]   Turn those off.
[00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:16.080]   The wells electric.
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:19.240]   If I lose my power, I don't have water.
[00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:21.240]   So there's an advantage to having a big bed.
[00:51:21.240 --> 00:51:26.960]   Don't be surprised if in a couple of years you see an incentive from California or other
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:27.960]   states.
[00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:29.600]   I think PG&E is already giving you credit for this.
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:35.440]   Yeah, just like they did for solar, they're having a problem as the cost of maintaining
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:36.680]   the grid goes up.
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:38.680]   Something like this takes the strain off the grid.
[00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:39.680]   That's right.
[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:40.680]   And so they are actually-
[00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:41.680]   It's a huge benefit to them.
[00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:42.680]   Huge benefit to them.
[00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:45.160]   So they'll subsidize it and you're talking about like a dollar a day for 10 years.
[00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:46.840]   You'll have something like this in your house.
[00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:48.840]   And for people who own homes, it's going to be a no-brainer.
[00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:51.800]   Yeah, if you're at home, coffee's going to check already through the first door.
[00:51:51.800 --> 00:51:54.280]   I didn't buy this one yet because I'm renting right now.
[00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:56.240]   So I moved up to San Francisco and I can't find my house.
[00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:57.240]   Oh, you moved up here.
[00:51:57.240 --> 00:51:58.240]   I'm living in Pac Heights right now.
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:52:01.240]   You're not living in beautiful Brentwood with a movie stars and-
[00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:03.040]   I'm selling my house right now in Brentwood.
[00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:04.040]   I'm living here.
[00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:05.040]   Well, you know what?
[00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:07.160]   It's like I was coming up here every week and I have a daughter now.
[00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:08.440]   It's like too much commuting.
[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:09.440]   So good.
[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:10.440]   So we'll see more of you.
[00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:11.440]   Absolutely.
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:12.440]   I'm down the block.
[00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:13.440]   Awesome.
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:14.440]   I thought you drove here from LA.
[00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:15.440]   I don't know why.
[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:16.440]   I'm going to do a nice job.
[00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:17.440]   I'm going to do a nice job.

[00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:20.400]   If you go to stamps.com, click the microphone on the upper right hand corner there.
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:22.240]   The offer code for this is TWIT.
[00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:24.160]   Just put "twit" in the offer code.
[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:26.160]   Then they know that you heard about it here.
[00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:28.400]   You'll get a $110 bonus offer.
[00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:29.840]   That includes that digital scale.
[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:33.320]   Yours to keep $55 in free postage.
[00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:35.560]   A month of stamps.com.
[00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:37.120]   It's really a nice deal.
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:38.120]   Stamps.com.
[00:55:38.120 --> 00:55:40.240]   Click the microphone.
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:43.600]   Use the offer code "twit" and transform your business.
[00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:45.080]   Do you know what we use it for?
[00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:46.080]   You know what media mail is?
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:47.080]   Yeah.
[00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:48.080]   So media mail.
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:49.080]   Books.
[00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:50.080]   When you send books.
[00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:51.080]   Yeah.
[00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:54.040]   The idea of selling a book for like two or three bucks and then you have to ship it for
[00:55:54.040 --> 00:55:56.080]   seven or eight dollars because it weighs a lot.
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:57.080]   It's crazy.
[00:55:57.080 --> 00:56:00.200]   So the US Postal Service came out with this thing called Media Mail which is like two
[00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:01.200]   bucks or something.
[00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:02.200]   But it's slow but it's still cheap.
[00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:03.200]   Yeah.
[00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:04.200]   It gets there in under ten days.
[00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:05.600]   It's five, six, seven days.
[00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:09.240]   But you can do it through stamps.com and we basically sell all of our books every year,
[00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:11.520]   all of our media and you can just get rid of it.
[00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:12.800]   I didn't even know you did books.
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:13.800]   Yeah.
[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:14.800]   I liked to read so many businesses.
[00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:15.800]   No, I just like to read.
[00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:16.800]   I'm a big reader.
[00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:17.800]   I like to learn.
[00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:18.800]   I do.
[00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:19.800]   I love books.
[00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:20.800]   I love books and I love audiobooks.
[00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:21.800]   Yeah.
[00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:22.800]   But media mail.
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:23.800]   It's a super tip.
[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:24.800]   All right.
[00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:26.800]   So you're going to tell us about the hype.
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:27.800]   It's a big scoop here.
[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:29.680]   See, it sounds science fiction crazy.
[00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:31.800]   The idea is how fast are you traveling?
[00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:35.720]   Well, it'll be thousands of miles per hour but I think that it's more realistic that
[00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:38.240]   you could say a thousand miles an hour.
[00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:42.160]   And how also from San Francisco to LA like half an hour?
[00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:43.160]   Yeah.
[00:56:43.160 --> 00:56:44.440]   I mean you're about 20, 30 minutes.
[00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:45.440]   So they're...
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:46.920]   I would love that.
[00:56:46.920 --> 00:56:48.920]   So Elon's not doing it just to be clear but...
[00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:49.920]   He proposed it.
[00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:50.920]   Yeah.
[00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:56.360]   So one of the SpaceX engineers is now doing it and I invested in a couple of other people
[00:56:56.360 --> 00:57:00.560]   have invested in it and we're going to make a two mile test track.
[00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:03.720]   And then from there, once we get the two mile test track and people can...
[00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:06.600]   And we're making a life size one and so when people can see that...
[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:07.600]   What do we do?
[00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:08.600]   Life size.
[00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:10.520]   Well, here's what I'm glad to hear that.
[00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:12.080]   It was actually going back to Elon Musk.
[00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:14.200]   We're doing a little h.o. size trains.
[00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:16.400]   People were suggesting make a small one.
[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:17.400]   Oh, there it is.
[00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:18.400]   Right?
[00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:21.160]   So we're actually making a full two mile track and...
[00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:22.640]   Are you going to ride in it?
[00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:25.600]   I don't know if humans will be in it but I wouldn't be opposed to it if it's tested
[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:27.800]   enough but here's the thing.
[00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:31.240]   What Elon learned with doing the space with the engines, they were like, "Oh, make a small
[00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:32.240]   size model."
[00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:33.240]   And it was like, you know what?
[00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:35.760]   The cost savings of making a small size model is the difference in materials.
[00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:36.760]   Right.
[00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:37.760]   It's not actually that much...
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:38.760]   It's not the building.
[00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:40.960]   The engineering and the time cost of all these engineers.
[00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:44.040]   So we've hired a couple dozen engineers and we're off to the races and we'll have it
[00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:46.040]   two mile track in the next two years.
[00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:47.520]   How important is that proof of concept?
[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:50.080]   That's how you get lawmakers and others to say, "Okay, this could work."
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:51.960]   It's like, you know, it's the...
[00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:56.520]   Basically, we just took the Elon Musk playbook from SpaceX and from Tesla which is, you have
[00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:57.520]   to prove it to people.
[00:57:57.520 --> 00:57:59.720]   So we proved it with this ridiculous roadster.
[00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:03.440]   People carrying $140,000 for basically an unusable car.
[00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:07.000]   And then, you know, the next one came out was the Model S which was somewhat usable.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.000]   And then the third gen will be the super user.
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:10.000]   Should I get the new...
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   Should I get the new...
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:12.000]   The X?
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   The X.
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:14.000]   It's all wing you have to get.
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:15.000]   It's going to be amazing.
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   But the third gen is going to have a new...
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.000]   I won't have any like a new...
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:18.000]   I can't even like a new car.
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   I have 18 batteries in there that I...
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:21.760]   It's casually, but so actually when the door is open, it doesn't go any...
[00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:23.720]   It's actually narrower than opening a regular door.
[00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:24.720]   Right.
[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:25.720]   It just goes like this.
[00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:26.720]   It just goes...
[00:58:26.720 --> 00:58:29.840]   But anyway, the Hyperloop, if it works, it could change everything because it could go
[00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:32.920]   underground and water to China and it's going to...
[00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:33.920]   What people think is about moving people...
[00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:35.720]   Oh, it's not going to LA.
[00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:38.680]   Well, LA, Vegas, everywhere is a possibility.
[00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:40.000]   Here's the thing.
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.400]   The magic of it could be shipping.
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:46.000]   If we can get it to work from here to China in our lifetime, you'd be moving stuff.
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:47.000]   You know who's saying that?
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   It's because of Apple.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:52.560]   Because if the two months it would take to put this on a ship, it's not...
[00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:53.560]   You're not going to do it.
[00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:54.560]   So there's...
[00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:55.560]   There's...
[00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:56.560]   So there's...
[00:58:56.560 --> 00:58:57.560]   There's...
[00:58:57.560 --> 00:58:58.560]   ...Liam and 747s.
[00:58:58.560 --> 00:59:00.920]   It turns out like a large percentage of the fossil fuel being used on the planet is being used
[00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:02.960]   by a small number of container ships.
[00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:06.840]   Like literally 100 container ships are causing a lot of the problems in the world.
[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:08.240]   So you just put this in the Hyperloop and...
[00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:09.240]   You're literally going to be shipping...
[00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:10.240]   What power is it?
[00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:12.240]   Well, so it could be any power...
[00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:13.240]   ...it's a electrical...
[00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:16.080]   A electrical, anything, but it's just because it's a vacuum, there's no resistance.
[00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:17.080]   Right.
[00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:22.560]   That just made me understand it and care about it because 34 seconds ago, I care less about
[00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:25.720]   Hyperloopin, but putting freight in it and moving it is fine.
[00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:26.720]   That makes sense.
[00:59:26.720 --> 00:59:27.720]   Other ones don't think it's scrambled eggs.
[00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:29.800]   I could think of the brains of scrambled eggs.
[00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:32.560]   People with their brains scrambled and that's all I could thinking.
[00:59:32.560 --> 00:59:33.560]   But shipping?
[00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:34.560]   Oh.
[00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:35.560]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:36.560]   Well, what...
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:37.560]   I think you dropped someone pointed for me on Google JSON.
[00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:38.560]   I'll pay you back after I...
[00:59:38.560 --> 00:59:39.560]   And then what's the thing?
[00:59:39.560 --> 00:59:41.760]   It's basically a giant pneumatic tube.
[00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:42.760]   Precisely.
[00:59:42.760 --> 00:59:43.760]   You're in China.
[00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:44.760]   Yeah.
[00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:45.760]   The interesting thing is also...
[00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:48.280]   Wait a minute, do you have to dig a tunnel to China?
[00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:51.520]   No, it would actually be floating in the water.
[00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:53.360]   And so it would...
[00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:59.480]   You basically would have it snaking to China under water at a certain depth that you would
[00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:03.600]   have to be make sure that people don't drop anchor on that area.
[01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:04.600]   Right, that's right.
[01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:05.760]   So like, I was like, "What's the biggest danger?"
[01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:06.760]   They're like, "An anchor?"
[01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:08.560]   I was like, "Yeah, that would be bad, wouldn't it?"
[01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:09.560]   But here's the very interesting thing.
[01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:12.560]   So that wouldn't be used for humans and all likelihood.
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:16.120]   But I was like, "Well, what happens if this tube gets compromised?"
[01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:19.000]   They're like, "Well, that's the greatest thing in the world in terms of safety because
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.280]   then it slows down because there's air in the tube."
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:26.320]   So the second you compromise the tube, like I said, a terrorist were to break it open.
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:28.080]   Everything just slows down and you stop.
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:29.080]   No problem.
[01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:30.080]   Right, it isn't land stopping.
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:31.080]   It's not a big deal.
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:32.080]   Right.
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:33.080]   So you know...
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:34.080]   And there's not people in it anyway.
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:35.080]   It's just 80,000 iPhones.
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:41.880]   Like, we could go an hour east of here or two hours east of here and have people commuting
[01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:46.720]   into San Francisco and you would solve this problem of the poor and the rich and the real
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:47.720]   estate crisis.
[01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:53.240]   So I think if this works, you could short real estate in New York, in Manhattan, LA, and San
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:59.000]   Francisco because people would be able to live on an anchor out two hours east of San
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.520]   Francisco and be able to come in and commute every day.
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:03.440]   It could be changed the world kind of stuff.
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:06.280]   Which is sort of as an angel investor what you're looking for.
[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:08.040]   Where is the test track going to be?
[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:09.040]   I can't say.
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.040]   You're not.
[01:01:10.040 --> 01:01:11.280]   But, yep, I do know.
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:12.280]   It's...
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:13.280]   It's in a backyard.
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:16.680]   Anyway, it doesn't really matter even where the test track is.
[01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:18.800]   I think we got enough money to get the test track done.
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:22.720]   And in two years, if we can prove the test track works, then it's a true game changer.
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:25.000]   It feels very science fiction.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000]   It isn't, it isn't.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.240]   You know, it's like a lot of the things that we think are science fiction.
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:30.480]   The technology is quite enough too.
[01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:35.120]   So when you just think about this device, what this device has done in terms of batteries
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:38.480]   and sensors is now allowing this next generation.
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:43.000]   So in the way DARPA and the internet allowed this whole level of commercialization to occur
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:48.320]   with the internet, the smartphone revolution and the sensors in here are allowing the drone
[01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:49.320]   revolution.
[01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:51.240]   You couldn't have the drone revolution without the batteries in here.
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:53.880]   You couldn't have the Tesla revolution with the batteries in here.
[01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:56.000]   So everything builds on itself.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.880]   And Father Roberts, we call him the quad father.
[01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:01.640]   He's our drone guy.
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:04.320]   Says it was actually the segue.
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:05.320]   Yeah.
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:09.760]   The technology for the segue was what led to the capability of doing these drones.
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:11.680]   The self-balancing and all that stuff.
[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:12.800]   That makes total sense.
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:18.520]   So let's talk about another futuristic idea that may not be as good as we thought.
[01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:20.080]   The hollow lens.
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:22.840]   Harry, you wrote about this at Fast Company.
[01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:24.560]   So you got the demo at build?
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:29.320]   Did the original demo back in January in Redmond and then the new demo of something close to
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:30.880]   the shipping units last week?
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:34.880]   Yeah, Paul and Mary Jo got both of those demos and they were both crazy.
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:37.120]   They were so excited after the first demo.
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:42.520]   You know, the Mars rover thing, the ability to put augmented reality on top of reality
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:45.360]   itself so that you can manipulate.
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:47.520]   But they were very disappointed with build.
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:51.240]   I mean, it was partially because on the first day of build, they had the keynote where
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:55.560]   on stage they would have somebody walk out wearing hollow lens.
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:03:00.800]   And then to give us an idea of what the experience was like on these giant video screens, they
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:06.280]   would overlay the holograms, the 3D objects on top of video of the person wearing the
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:07.640]   headset.
[01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:11.120]   And there'd be giant screens on the wall that were holograms.
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:12.600]   There'd be a dog down here.
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:14.440]   There'd be a spinning globe over here.
[01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:18.120]   It really felt like you'd see this stuff all around you.
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:24.360]   Well, the units that we got to try a day later, which I mean, they're much closer in terms
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:27.160]   of industrial design to the final product than what we saw back in January.
[01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:28.160]   You don't have a fanny pack.
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:29.160]   There's no wires.
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:30.400]   It's a headset that works well.
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:31.960]   I worked fine with my glasses.
[01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:33.120]   Windows 10 is built into it.
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:34.800]   Windows 10 is built into it.
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:41.760]   But there's this small window in the middle of your field of view where you see the hologram.
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:44.200]   And at first I thought there was something wrong with that because-
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:45.960]   That's what Thorett thought.
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:46.960]   He actually gave it back.
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:47.960]   He said, no, no, it's wrong.
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:48.960]   Me too.
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:51.160]   We could use a little programming project.
[01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:55.440]   There was these little balls and ramps on a little platform.
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:56.440]   And I couldn't see the whole thing.
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:58.520]   And I was moving my head back and forth.
[01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:03.000]   And I realized if I went back a few steps and bent my knees, I could see the whole thing.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.440]   And it turned out that that's the way it is.
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:10.320]   There's just a little sort of subset of your field of view where that's their hologram.
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:15.360]   And I was way more bothered by it because a day before Microsoft had made it unbelievable.
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:17.560]   We're watching the demo on stage.
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:18.560]   And it looks so good.
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:22.480]   And if they had said, well, of course, in this first unit, you're just going to see
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:23.480]   it right in front of you.
[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:24.480]   And that's fine.
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:27.440]   It's not just somebody from Microsoft who said that after he views this for a while,
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:29.440]   you start to forget about it.
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:33.240]   Which I can believe because even after an hour, it was less bothersome domain.
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:37.720]   But I think they are setting expectations way too high by having this truly science
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:39.800]   fiction-y on stage demo experience.
[01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:44.040]   And I hope before they actually ship this thing that they push people's expectations
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:46.640]   down so low that it becomes mind-blowing again.
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:49.880]   Because even with the limitations, it's pretty incredible.
[01:04:49.880 --> 01:04:51.760]   What do you think went wrong?
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:55.320]   Is it just that you don't have enough compute power to make it?
[01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:58.600]   Microsoft has said very little about how this works.
[01:04:58.600 --> 01:05:02.080]   But it's pretty clear there's some, you know, you have a little screen which has been rejected
[01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:03.080]   in front of your eyes.
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:04.080]   Right.
[01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:05.880]   And that little screen does not wrap around experience.
[01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:09.680]   Is this closer to the actual experience, what we're seeing right there?
[01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:13.000]   As far as I know, no, that's even that is not all that close.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.160]   As far as I know, they've never actually shown how this works.
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:20.240]   On their website for HoloLens, it looks even more amazing than it does in that demo.
[01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:24.480]   Clearly, I mean, does something do with the screen or the processing power or something?
[01:05:24.480 --> 01:05:26.800]   Or people who are walking into walls or?
[01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:27.800]   And it's not like Oculus.
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:29.360]   We're Oculus, you know.
[01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:30.480]   That's your whole field of view.
[01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:31.480]   It's all around you.
[01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:32.480]   Yeah.
[01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:36.560]   But see, that's kind of what I liked about augmented reality, like HoloLens versus virtual
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:41.080]   reality is that I'm not sealed away inside something else.
[01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:44.880]   I'm actually seeing the world around me, but I'm getting additional information about it.
[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:46.440]   It seemed like a great user interface.
[01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:48.920]   This could still be pretty spectacular even with the limitations.
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:49.920]   And who knows?
[01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:53.720]   Maybe this is a first generation kind of thing and generation two a year later will solve
[01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:54.720]   this.
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:06:00.400]   You know, I was so excited because I'm waiting for like my Star Trek, Holodak, and so I'm
[01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:02.480]   so excited about it.
[01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:07.080]   But I think that they also like the way that they marketed it as like a user interface inside
[01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:08.080]   of your house.
[01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:10.040]   I don't think it's its best application.
[01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:14.400]   I think that using it for research, being able to take a look in three dimensions of a brain
[01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:19.480]   or do surgeries and see actually how everything's interacting with itself would be better because
[01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:23.440]   all I'm thinking about is like Leo, think about being at home and everyone in the house
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:25.480]   is wearing their HoloLens.
[01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:27.600]   What's happening to our social dynamic and how are we talking to each other?
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:29.920]   Well, we're all looking at our phones and watches anyway.
[01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:31.800]   Might as well look at the glasses.
[01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:35.360]   That's why the watch is better than the phone is because you're not looking at it most of
[01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:36.360]   the time.
[01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:41.360]   Now, we're not only looking at it, but we've released most of like body languages is dealt
[01:06:41.360 --> 01:06:42.360]   with.
[01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:43.360]   How do we talk to each other?
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:47.000]   Language is mostly like 80% is looking at facial features.
[01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.960]   And so we've lost most of them.
[01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:53.160]   So I worry about using a whole bunch of people in their house with Holodak lenses.
[01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:56.840]   I think that it's going to put a little bit of a damage to our social constraints as each
[01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:58.680]   of the dealing with our virtual world.
[01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:05.520]   Unless you're Tony Stark and you've got something going on where you need to rebuild a space
[01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:06.840]   machine or something.
[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:09.400]   I have no reason to care about this stuff at all.
[01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:11.200]   It is the most annoying.
[01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:12.360]   Is your life that bad?
[01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:14.000]   Do you not have a LED TV?
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000]   No, do you not have a nice phone?
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.000]   Imagine.
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.000]   You're not having a phone.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.000]   You're not going to listen to me.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.000]   Do you not have nice things?
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000]   Are you not married to a beautiful woman?
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.720]   Don't you want to just look at her and the television and watch four gay movies?
[01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:28.320]   I don't care about a blue bubble of water sitting in my face.
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:29.320]   It's just silly.
[01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:31.040]   I don't need to stand up and scape somebody.
[01:07:31.040 --> 01:07:32.520]   I got the computer sitting right here.
[01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:33.520]   I got it on my phone.
[01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:34.760]   I got it on my tablet.
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:37.600]   Just FYI, people do stare at their phones for one more thing.
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:40.320]   They stare at their watches because they ain't nobody's scrolling up on Facebook on their
[01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:41.320]   watch.
[01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:42.320]   That's what people don't look at.
[01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:44.320]   They're all going to Instagram and Facebook.
[01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:47.240]   I don't even know how they're going to do a bubbly thing on my eyes.
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:51.200]   I love the real world and the real world is beautiful.
[01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:52.200]   Wow.
[01:07:52.200 --> 01:07:53.960]   I still want it.
[01:07:53.960 --> 01:07:55.120]   Can I have it anyway?
[01:07:55.120 --> 01:07:56.680]   You can do it.
[01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:59.040]   He makes a very good point about virtual reality.
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:00.240]   We've seen this movie before, right?
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:02.040]   We've been promised four or five times.
[01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:03.040]   Protect kids.
[01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:05.040]   We remember VRML.
[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:06.480]   We remember Jeremy, you're telling us.
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:10.760]   We're all going to fly through Yahoo, directory and click on Arts and Entertainment and pull
[01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:16.400]   out a folder and that's going to be faster and better than our normal searches on Google.
[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:17.560]   It's never happened.
[01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:20.080]   With Oculus, certainly they're made great advances.
[01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:23.720]   What is the killer app going to be outside of video games and adult entertainment?
[01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:24.720]   Oh, I can see it.
[01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:25.720]   You can see it.
[01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:26.720]   Killer apps.
[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:28.440]   For VR, adult entertainment and VR is amazing.
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:29.440]   For sure.
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:30.440]   Well, it is.
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:34.600]   If you have something you want to share with us, it's a device or service we don't know
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:36.160]   about that at Canadian show investing.
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:37.160]   Oh, yes.
[01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:39.160]   I didn't know that existed yet.
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:40.320]   Does it exist right?
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:41.320]   Absolutely.
[01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:42.320]   Okay.
[01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:48.160]   Well, get you Samsung gear VR and then you actually can surf to websites that will.
[01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:49.160]   I don't know.
[01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:50.560]   It's a little scary, actually.
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:51.560]   Yeah.
[01:08:51.560 --> 01:08:52.560]   So I'm with Doctor.
[01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:53.560]   I don't know that it's going to be super compelling.
[01:08:53.560 --> 01:08:56.920]   Even with video games, people like to hang out and play video games.
[01:08:56.920 --> 01:08:57.920]   But AR.
[01:08:57.920 --> 01:08:58.920]   Okay.
[01:08:58.920 --> 01:08:59.920]   But AR is different.
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:01.920]   One crap start doing the show.
[01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:03.360]   And I want to be our.
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:05.360]   So he looks like the garden.
[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:07.040]   You look like the studio with me.
[01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:08.040]   He's like Jordy.
[01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:09.040]   Jordy LaForte is here.
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:10.040]   Yeah.
[01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:11.040]   The set is awesome here.
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:12.040]   I can't believe.
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:13.040]   I feel like I'm right there.
[01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:14.040]   I want to do that.
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:15.960]   I want to put a VR camera.
[01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:17.760]   But augmented reality is different.
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:21.480]   See, augmented reality is going to be awesome when it's so lightweight.
[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:25.560]   When you're wearing your sunglasses and when you're walking by, you can see that this
[01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:29.440]   restaurant is four and a half stars on Yelp and that the special is this.
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:33.000]   And when you go by the movie theater, it's like, Hey, here are the movies rated by Rotten
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.400]   Tomato Square in this movie theater.
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:36.480]   And there's one starting at this time.
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:38.960]   And when you're driving life to be like that, I can look over your head.
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:39.960]   See your net worth.
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:41.240]   I can look over Harry's head.
[01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:42.240]   Get his.
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:43.240]   Get his.
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:44.240]   It's that it's a reputation.
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:46.800]   It's not just me and lets me know all those things.
[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:48.680]   It just no, no, no, no, you want to float in.
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:51.440]   I know, but you have to go like this and block your head.
[01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:54.880]   I think I, but you know what's interesting is they did that thing with how old do you
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:55.880]   look.
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:56.880]   Yeah, that was dumb.
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:00.200]   It's a side putting that at the same time as the augmented reality stuff.
[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:03.000]   I don't think anybody put together that when you wear glasses, you're going to be able
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:08.720]   to walk around the world and see how old people are and that kind of information or
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:10.040]   if you've ever met them before.
[01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:12.760]   That's not really what Microsoft is trying to do with HoloLens.
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:13.960]   That's the Google Glass vision.
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:14.960]   Right.
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:18.640]   And HoloLens, the most compelling demos they did during the keynote were things like architecture
[01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:22.400]   where you're standing around a table looking at a large model or minecraft.
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:23.400]   And anatomy.
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:25.200]   You can see these full size bodies.
[01:10:25.200 --> 01:10:27.120]   Yeah, again, those things are useful.
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:30.320]   Like, like I said, if you're Tony Stark and you, or you're a doctor and you want to look
[01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:32.760]   inside of her because you're about to do surgery, that's cool.
[01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:36.160]   We're sitting in some eyes living room looking at a little watery bubble thing with the weather
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:37.160]   is stupid to me.
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:38.160]   And I don't care.
[01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:39.160]   I'll tell you really.
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:41.920]   If somebody who's doing something technical with it and doing something important, I don't
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:42.920]   know.
[01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:44.400]   I'll tell you about a company I was invested in.
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:47.240]   They were doing something very interesting, which was you could take the number of shelves
[01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:49.200]   you wanted to put in a room.
[01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:52.640]   You take out your iPad and you would say, I want to put shelves over there.
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:55.480]   And you say, okay, that's four feet wide and 12 feet tall.
[01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:57.360]   And it would just put how many shelves would fit there.
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:10:59.680]   And you say, well, I want to have deeper shelves or wider shelves.
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:00.680]   I love that.
[01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:04.680]   And then you could hit by and it would then ship you all the pieces and you put it together
[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:05.680]   for my kids.
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:06.680]   That's kind of trippy.
[01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:07.680]   Yeah.
[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:08.680]   That sounds useful.
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:12.480]   So I think in architecture, in furniture and like what's going to be in the space and
[01:11:12.480 --> 01:11:15.600]   education, especially the HoloLens stuff is going to work really well.
[01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:17.760]   Harry, do you feel like it's a new UI though?
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:22.760]   I mean, I think the UI needs more work because they have this thing called an air tap where
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:23.760]   you kind of go like this.
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:24.760]   Air tap.
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:25.760]   And you do that.
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:26.760]   Yeah.
[01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:27.760]   That's not good.
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:28.760]   And it doesn't work all that well.
[01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:30.080]   And B, it's so fairly limited.
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:31.080]   I think as...
[01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:32.640]   And you kind of look like a douche.
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:33.640]   Yeah.
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:34.640]   You look at it.
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:40.000]   As mixed reality and augmented reality and virtual reality, get more real.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.080]   I think you're going to want to just use your hands.
[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:44.080]   And that's the type of stuff that's happening.
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:46.720]   But you know, with the Connect on the Xbox, you can do that.
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:48.480]   I don't think it works very well.
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:52.520]   Gestures like this, where you kind of wax on, wax off.
[01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:53.520]   Wax off, wax off.
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:54.520]   And you're...
[01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:55.520]   And they don't work very well.
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:58.760]   It's the folks from Leap Motion who do the game controller.
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:11:59.760]   Yeah, but I'll leave.
[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:00.760]   That's silly too.
[01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:01.760]   Well, they're also...
[01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:03.680]   They're working on virtual reality though, where...
[01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:04.680]   Yeah.
[01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:06.000]   And it does work better than the air tap.
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.280]   Georgia, this is going to be good for your practice, right?
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:09.280]   Is this...
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:10.280]   Are we going to...
[01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:14.080]   Do you already see people who are kind of disassociated from the real world, kids who
[01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:16.880]   grow up associating with screens better than humans?
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:18.560]   And is this going to increase?
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:22.120]   Yeah, well, the unfortunate thing is that whatever we do, we end up getting better,
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:23.120]   right?
[01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:25.040]   So whatever you're practicing, you're getting better at.
[01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:29.640]   So people are not really doing really well with reading each other's social cues.
[01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:35.200]   And so social skills are going down because people are interfacing more with a unreal
[01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:36.200]   world.
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:42.400]   And so it unfortunately increases social anxiety and people feeling, you know, depressed.
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:49.120]   Because if you can be a God in a video game and you're in school suffering in real life,
[01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:50.120]   who's going to...
[01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:51.120]   Who would ever choose?
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:52.120]   I'd always choose a God.
[01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:54.000]   It's going to win out every time.
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:58.360]   Plus the games are marketed to make people to increase the reaction of dopamine, so that
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:00.960]   off on switch of making us feel good.
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:04.920]   And it's becoming closer and closer to feeling more and more real.
[01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:10.320]   So I think that it's a huge time sink and unfortunately not great for our brains.
[01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:13.600]   But I think that in the other hand, I think that we can all see his virtual reality to
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:18.400]   get over different types of fears and to help people that are dealing with the manner in
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:20.000]   which they interact with the world as well.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.280]   So I think that it's how we use it more than if the technology is good or bad.
[01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:26.360]   It almost sounded like high school just then.
[01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:28.320]   We're talking about being a God.
[01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:31.720]   And high school is the quarterback and then I got out and I couldn't get a job because
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:32.720]   I'm a loser.
[01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:34.840]   I mean, life is kind of the same things.
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:39.560]   And virtual helping someone be more social, you're still taking them away from being social.
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:40.560]   Some people are good with people.
[01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:41.800]   I love myself.
[01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:45.600]   Some people are horrible like Uncle Jason sometimes because he's from New York and he's got the
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:46.600]   attitude.
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:47.600]   What do you try to do with you?
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:49.600]   I'm Jason Schenkel and I am an introvert.
[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:53.800]   No, I'm an introvert and we have a 12 year at home as an introvert and we spend a lot
[01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:54.800]   of time in the screen.
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:55.800]   It's fascinating.
[01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:57.800]   Are you really like a virus break introvert?
[01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:58.800]   Oh, I hate people.
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:13:59.800]   I am TJ.
[01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:00.800]   Yeah.
[01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:01.800]   I think it's a misch and throw.
[01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:02.800]   That's not an introvert.
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:03.800]   I'm a misch and throw and an introvert.
[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:04.800]   Really?
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:05.800]   It's a tough combination.
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:08.800]   I hate people and I don't want to be around them.
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:15.320]   No, after when I get home after doing all this interacting with people, I just want to
[01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:16.320]   recharge.
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:20.680]   I just want to put on a virtual head unit and go talk to them.
[01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:22.680]   I want to get my hyper loop.
[01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:23.680]   Curl up a little.
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:24.680]   Curl up a little.
[01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:26.720]   Almost like your Tesla battery pack.
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:30.520]   You're recharging during that period of time because you've expended so much energy outside
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:31.520]   of your comfort zone.
[01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:32.520]   Yeah.
[01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:33.520]   And that's the key.
[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:35.440]   Yeah, but it works too well, right?
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:39.000]   If you want to get better at something, you have to practice it.
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.000]   I practice it all day and I still hate people.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:45.320]   So how did you change your profession in that case?
[01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:47.720]   If you think about it, my profession is radio announcer.
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:49.080]   What do you do if you're a radio announcer?
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:55.280]   You sit in a empty room, pad in room and speak into a machine all by yourself.
[01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:56.280]   That's right.
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:57.440]   I chose the right profession.
[01:14:57.440 --> 01:14:59.280]   I don't know how I got here.
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:01.280]   This is a mess.
[01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:04.240]   And you're so good at it.
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:08.520]   It always feels like, Georgia, we're teaching ourselves to be Asperger's like a little bit
[01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:11.440]   or autistic, a little bit on the spectrum.
[01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:13.400]   On the spectrum, right?
[01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:16.760]   It does increase our inability to deal with other people.
[01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:21.960]   And unfortunately, because our lives are so, we're playing to our own weaknesses of not
[01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:24.640]   having to move, not having to deal with other things.
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:26.200]   We're getting worse at it.
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:31.600]   So you want to always make sure that you're thinking about being slightly outside of your
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:35.080]   comfort zone at the same time so that you don't get worse at the skills that you need
[01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:36.240]   to get better at.
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:39.240]   I just don't like when you said about like a virtual ad, it could help that because I
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:40.720]   feel like that's still some kind of a scream.
[01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:43.120]   You're not making a friend can help you do that.
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:46.000]   Like, I mean, I know people don't, I guess.
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:49.920]   I just live in a world where I see kids and people say, "Oh, kids don't get out and play.
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:52.200]   My daughter plays every sports, her friends play stuff.
[01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:53.200]   They come over here.
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:54.200]   I've got everything.
[01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:56.640]   She's got her own TV in her room, her play room, Xbox.
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:15:57.640]   We don't worry about it.
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:58.640]   They still go outside and play.
[01:15:58.640 --> 01:16:00.200]   They go outside and play catch.
[01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:01.200]   They go across and play basketball.
[01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:03.640]   Like, they have everything and they still go do stuff.
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:04.640]   Some people do.
[01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:05.640]   Some people don't.
[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:06.640]   That's the way the world works.
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:07.960]   But I think you're absolutely right.
[01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:10.240]   I think that, you know, it's important to do it.
[01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:13.520]   And with my kids, I actually don't have them play video games or do with tech even though
[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:18.600]   I have like a full grown like arcade cabinet, MAME and every single video game and technology
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:19.600]   piece in my house.
[01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:20.600]   Can I come over?
[01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:21.600]   Yeah, hey, sure.
[01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:22.600]   You can bring this through us.
[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:23.600]   We have fun.
[01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:29.240]   But in some ways it can be helpful.
[01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:34.800]   So say that you have a really strong phobia of spiders and such a phobia, we start really,
[01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:35.800]   really small.
[01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:40.000]   So we would get a picture of a spider and then a picture of a spider that's moving.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:44.040]   And then you can think how the virtual reality would make it one step closer before I actually
[01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:45.360]   bring in, which I do.
[01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:47.760]   I wrangle real spiders and bring them in there.
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:52.160]   But it would be great to have a virtual experience where they're interacting with a little
[01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:57.000]   tiny spider on their hand virtually, which would increase their anxiety response.
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:00.840]   They could then plateau with it and then it would be much easier to take that next step
[01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:04.040]   when I bring a live spider into session.
[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:06.800]   My love for you has been renewed tenfold and I apologize.
[01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:08.520]   That is a great example.
[01:17:08.520 --> 01:17:11.000]   And I am not the one to not deny when I'm incorrect.
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.280]   You have proven me semi incorrect.
[01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:14.280]   So I stay incorrect.
[01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:15.280]   He is semi incorrect.
[01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:16.280]   I'm semi incorrect.
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:17.280]   I'm semi incorrect.
[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:20.280]   Perfect example to share.
[01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:21.280]   All right.
[01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:22.280]   All right.
[01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:23.280]   All right.
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:25.760]   By the way, I just want to say I don't, I love humanity.
[01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:26.760]   It's people.
[01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:27.760]   I just want to be clear.
[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:28.760]   Right.
[01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:29.760]   I think it's certain people.
[01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:30.760]   Okay.
[01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:31.760]   It's just people I don't like.
[01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:32.760]   All right.
[01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:33.760]   As long as you know what I love.
[01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:35.160]   There was so many people, humanity would be so much better off.
[01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:36.160]   I agree.
[01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:37.160]   Right.
[01:17:37.160 --> 01:17:38.160]   Exactly.
[01:17:38.160 --> 01:17:39.160]   My point.
[01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:40.160]   Georgia Dow is the greatest.
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:41.160]   We're so glad to have you.
[01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:42.160]   I'm more.com.
[01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:43.160]   Jason Callicannis from Inside.com.
[01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:44.160]   That's your current enterprise.
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:45.160]   Yeah.
[01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:46.160]   I kind of comprehend.
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:48.080]   Although it sounds like you got a lot of irons in the fire.
[01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:49.080]   You still do launch, right?
[01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:50.080]   The launch.
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:51.080]   I still do a launch festival.
[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:52.080]   Yeah.
[01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:53.080]   Twelve thousand people to share.
[01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:54.080]   Twelve thousand people were out at this year.
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:55.080]   What?
[01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:56.080]   That's crazy.
[01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:57.480]   I have to make money from the conferences anymore.
[01:17:57.480 --> 01:17:59.320]   So I just give all the tickets for free to founders.
[01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:00.320]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:02.880]   So I gave away at eleven thousand tickets out of the twelve thousand.
[01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:05.160]   And it costs like a million and have pucks to do.
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:08.240]   Did you watch the tech crunch cut all the attention on Silicon Valley to show?
[01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:09.240]   No, not really.
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:10.240]   I mean Mike screwed me.
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:11.240]   Mike and I were partners in the conference obviously.
[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:12.240]   He screwed me out of it.
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:15.800]   And then I went and started my own and I got like a very toxic person out of my life.
[01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:17.600]   Which was like, wow, this is great.
[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:20.240]   By the way, Mike's going to be on the show next week just in case you want to come.
[01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:21.240]   Oh, no, I'm joking.
[01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:23.880]   That would be an interesting show though.
[01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:24.880]   Joking.
[01:18:24.880 --> 01:18:26.760]   Everyone will be tuning in.
[01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:29.920]   No, and then on last week's, do you watch Silicon Valley or is it?
[01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:30.920]   Yeah, it's the last week.
[01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:31.920]   No, I love it.
[01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:32.920]   I think it's.
[01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:33.920]   Cara and Walter on it.
[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:36.280]   Listen, I think the show is great except for the cameos.
[01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:39.400]   And by the reason I hate the cameos is because I haven't had one yet.
[01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:40.400]   Yeah.
[01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:43.280]   But when I finally get my cameo, then I will absolutely endorse the show.
[01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:44.280]   Exactly.
[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:47.600]   They're at the close conference and they're sitting in their red chairs.
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:49.160]   No, they contacted me.
[01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:50.160]   It was.
[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:51.160]   Yeah.
[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:52.160]   Yeah, they said that.
[01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:53.160]   Oh, who's writing for them is Dan Long?
[01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:54.160]   Dan Long is exactly.
[01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:56.240]   Two people contacted me from there like, hey, want to sit down or whatever.
[01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:57.760]   So I'm sure I'll be on some season.
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:18:59.080]   Fake Steve Jobs who then.
[01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:00.080]   Yep.
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:01.080]   For four minutes.
[01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:02.080]   They nail it though.
[01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:03.080]   Editor in chief at Valley Way.
[01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:04.080]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:05.080]   And then.
[01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:06.080]   Sorry about toxic.
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:07.080]   I love Dan though.
[01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:08.080]   In fact, we've been trying to get him.
[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:09.080]   Dan's a pretty good writer.
[01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:10.080]   Yeah, he's a good writer.
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:13.520]   And I'm very curious because he it's clear that he's giving them a lot of inside stuff.
[01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:19.240]   They are they nail it and I think the only thing I wonder is like, are they nailing it
[01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:20.720]   too much and it's too insider base?
[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:21.720]   I think he kind of is.
[01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:23.200]   He doesn't understand what they're talking about.
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:23.720]   Or care.
[01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:25.720]   But the whole value version thing was so accurate.
[01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:26.720]   I thought that was great.
[01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:29.680]   Yeah, so accurate and weird when they were nagging and they were getting all the term
[01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:32.600]   sheets coming in higher and higher and then everything went away.
[01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:36.240]   I mean, it reminds you of Secret which we saw last week and floated where like, you know,
[01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:37.240]   they took too much money.
[01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:40.440]   I Piper went crazy and then it comes crashing down and then it goes back up and it crashes
[01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:41.920]   back down and nobody knows.
[01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:44.240]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:46.680]   I actually want to talk about Secret.
[01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:48.040]   When we get Jason here, we got it.
[01:19:48.040 --> 01:19:51.680]   We got to kind of find out about the inside stories and all that stuff because he knows
[01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:53.080]   all the dirt.
[01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:56.960]   So Harry McCracken from the Technologizer who knows all tells all at Fast Company dot
[01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:57.960]   com.
[01:19:57.960 --> 01:20:01.160]   Great writer and great writer and Oh, doctor.
[01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:02.160]   Great speaker.
[01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:06.360]   I feel I feel the spiders.
[01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:07.360]   Jesus.
[01:20:07.360 --> 01:20:10.840]   I have left like five 22 minutes ago.
[01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:12.800]   I am so happy to be here on Google.
[01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:13.800]   It's like Jason's here.
[01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:14.800]   You let him go.
[01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:17.240]   Jason's like some dystopian science fiction films.
[01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:18.680]   Yeah, it's a Christmas party.
[01:20:18.680 --> 01:20:20.240]   It says he got doctor 2000.
[01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:21.240]   Oh, doctor 2000.
[01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:25.680]   I think this is a sequel to Blade Runner faster and furious.
[01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:26.680]   This is filming.
[01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:28.160]   Now we know why Apple bought beats.
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:31.920]   Can we talk about statistics go to meeting an incredible product that I use an incredible
[01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:35.480]   product that only we only advertise incredible products that Jason Calican is used.
[01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:36.480]   I use it.
[01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:37.480]   I have two accounts.
[01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:38.480]   11.
[01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:39.480]   What do you have to account for?
[01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:40.480]   One for each company.
[01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:41.480]   We're not launched when I decide because we use it.
[01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:42.960]   So I do about 10 go to meetings a week.
[01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:43.960]   We do.
[01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:46.600]   I don't do that many, but we do them almost every day because it's a great way and it's
[01:20:46.600 --> 01:20:50.800]   so easy because if what you have to go to meeting account, it's you just click a button
[01:20:50.800 --> 01:20:53.800]   and the meeting is set up and it's so often you just want to conference call.
[01:20:53.800 --> 01:20:55.440]   So it sets up an easy conference call.
[01:20:55.440 --> 01:20:58.360]   But then if you need to, you can share your screen.
[01:20:58.360 --> 01:21:01.400]   So if you've got a presentation or images or you just want to show them the picture of
[01:21:01.400 --> 01:21:03.960]   the first Tesla, you can show them that.
[01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:08.240]   And then if you want to turn on your cameras, suddenly like you are meeting in person, you
[01:21:08.240 --> 01:21:11.800]   could see them in high depth video and you can meet on anything.
[01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:16.680]   A computer, a tablet, a smartphone, you can literally present from an iPad in your backyard.
[01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:17.680]   I've done it.
[01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:18.680]   It's awesome.
[01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:21.400]   So here's the deal, 30 days, absolutely free.
[01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:23.680]   You don't have to give them a credit card.
[01:21:23.680 --> 01:21:27.000]   They've made this as easy as possible because they know once you set it up, you'll have
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:28.560]   your first meeting going in minutes.
[01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:29.560]   It's a no-brainer.
[01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:34.120]   In fact, even if you didn't try it today, if on Monday or Tuesday you got a conference
[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:36.360]   call or meeting with somebody, just try it.
[01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:37.360]   Go to meeting.com.
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:41.120]   It won't take you any time to set it up and the nice thing is it won't take your confer
[01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:42.280]   e anytime either.
[01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:45.320]   And that's nice because if you're doing a sales presentation, you don't want your client
[01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:47.560]   to have to jump through hoops to hear your pitch.
[01:21:47.560 --> 01:21:48.560]   Make it easy.
[01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:49.560]   Make it engaging.
[01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:50.560]   Go to meeting.com.
[01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:52.680]   Click the try it free button.
[01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:53.680]   30 days free.
[01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:55.080]   You do not need to give them a credit card.
[01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:56.080]   There's no obligation.
[01:21:56.080 --> 01:21:57.520]   No salesman will call.
[01:21:57.520 --> 01:21:58.680]   Go to meeting.com.
[01:21:58.680 --> 01:21:59.680]   Try it free.
[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:02.320]   You know what the best feature to go to meeting us now?
[01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:03.320]   What?
[01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:08.280]   Well, aside from the meeting starts on time, which is the reason I use it is because it
[01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:09.280]   just works.
[01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:10.280]   One click you're in.
[01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:14.280]   But the really killer feature they have now is there's a Chrome extension that I use
[01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:16.480]   that puts it into your Google Calendar.
[01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:19.640]   So when I'm looking at my Google Calendar, I press one button and it just sends everybody
[01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:20.640]   the meeting stuff.
[01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:23.920]   So literally the friction between putting something in my calendar and then having the
[01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:25.400]   go to meeting set up is zero.
[01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:27.920]   I use my assistance to set that up, send everybody the instructions.
[01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:29.480]   So much easier.
[01:22:29.480 --> 01:22:32.120]   Just you can Google go to meeting Chrome extension.
[01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:33.840]   It just works in your calendar.
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:34.840]   It's genius.
[01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:37.200]   Harry, was anything else that you thought was important?
[01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:38.200]   Microsoft did.
[01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:39.920]   I mean, it was a developers conference.
[01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:43.320]   So they really, in fact, the first hour and a half of the keynote, they don't even say
[01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:45.080]   Windows at all almost.
[01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:46.640]   It's like all about Visual Studio.
[01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:47.640]   Azure and stuff.
[01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:48.640]   Yeah, and Cloud.
[01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:54.920]   I mean, the other big news was that developers can take Android code and iOS code and give
[01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:58.000]   themselves a big head start on writing Windows applications.
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.600]   My question is who cares?
[01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:02.880]   Well, I don't think that's not going to say Windows.
[01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:05.240]   Well, Windows Phone, it's not going to say.
[01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:08.640]   Developers are going to want to write for Windows and Windows Phone because there's a
[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:09.640]   critical mass of people.
[01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:10.640]   There's a lot of billion people.
[01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:12.840]   They want to get a billion and a half people using it right away.
[01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:18.560]   I think just in terms of reaching out to this community, this new generation of developers
[01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:22.840]   who don't have this background of the era when everybody did Windows, it gets helpful.
[01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:23.840]   It's sort of like that.
[01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:24.840]   They need to reach out.
[01:23:24.840 --> 01:23:26.920]   But if I'm an iOS guy, am I going to say, oh, great.
[01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:27.920]   Now I can write it for Windows?
[01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:30.440]   Well, you can get a little bit of a head start, I think, and that might have some value to
[01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:31.440]   it.
[01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:33.640]   Do we know how hard it would be to do the port?
[01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:35.280]   According to Microsoft, it's super easy.
[01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:36.280]   Of course it is.
[01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:39.840]   It's not just recompiling it and boom, it works, but it's somewhat close to that.
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:41.000]   Of course, you wouldn't want to do that.
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.960]   You'd want to add Windows-specific functionality.
[01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:48.120]   I think when all of a sudden you'd want to write Windows apps using the kinds of tools
[01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:50.760]   designed to write good Windows apps.
[01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:55.720]   The applications they use as an example, Candy Crush and Cut the Rope 2, there isn't
[01:23:55.720 --> 01:23:57.520]   a Windows API.
[01:23:57.520 --> 01:23:58.520]   There's no menus.
[01:23:58.520 --> 01:23:59.520]   There's no menus.
[01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:00.520]   There's no menus.
[01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:01.520]   There's no menus.
[01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:02.520]   It's swiping.
[01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:04.120]   So of course, it works fine, but I hate to see somebody.
[01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:07.960]   If you're writing a productivity app, you want it to look like a Windows app.
[01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:12.340]   And then some of your existing code might be repurposed in a way that might be valuable.
[01:24:12.340 --> 01:24:16.000]   It does feel like though Microsoft's making a pivot.
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:22.920]   And that instead of saying Windows everywhere, Microsoft Office everywhere, they're saying,
[01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:25.860]   we will let people use our apps on any platform.
[01:24:25.860 --> 01:24:29.720]   The cloud is really the platform, not the desktop operating system.
[01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:31.480]   He's doing a no, he gets it.
[01:24:31.480 --> 01:24:32.480]   He gets it.
[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:33.480]   He gets it.
[01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:34.480]   He's doing everything right.
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:35.480]   As far as I'm concerned.
[01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:36.480]   It seems like it.
[01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:39.840]   I'm seeing come up more and more often at startups are using it.
[01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:44.360]   See, that's interesting because startups are so tight that a lamp stack and it just works
[01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:45.560]   with all that stuff.
[01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:50.400]   And they went into Y Combinator and gave everybody a half million dollars worth of free credits
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:54.440]   that they could use at any point in time over three years, which is like, okay, if the
[01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:57.000]   startup decides in month 30, they want to be on Azure.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.840]   They could spend it off from months 30 of 36.
[01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:03.360]   The other thing that's very interesting is the Outlook app on iPad is tremendous.
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:05.120]   It's the best email app on iOS.
[01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:07.240]   It's not Microsoft.
[01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:10.800]   And then they also bought Sunrise, which was the number one calendar app.
[01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:15.080]   So what you're seeing is, you know, bomber and gates were like, hey, not built here.
[01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:16.080]   No good.
[01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:17.640]   Now they're saying, hey, let's buy calendar.
[01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:19.120]   Let's buy these other things.
[01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:20.120]   Let's be competitive.
[01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:21.120]   Let's put it on everything.
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:23.480]   And I can tell you the real secret that's going to come out in the next year or two, I
[01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:26.640]   think, is the embracing of the Android fork.
[01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:29.920]   So this company, um, cyanogen, I think.
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:30.920]   Yes, cyanogen.
[01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:31.920]   Yeah.
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:32.920]   Cyanogen, which a couple of friends of mine have invested in.
[01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:35.080]   I'm not an investor in.
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:37.480]   They are going to bundle all the Microsoft apps.
[01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:40.680]   Now what I think is going to happen is at some point, Microsoft's going to put up the
[01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:43.840]   flag on Windows Mobile.
[01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:48.120]   And I think what they're going to do is buy cyanogen or they're going to say, you know,
[01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:54.000]   we'll just incorporate cyanogen somehow into the Microsoft suite of phones.
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:58.880]   And then they bought it, then they would, then Android would work everywhere.
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:01.480]   They have a great product with the Lumia phones.
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:02.480]   Incredible products.
[01:26:02.480 --> 01:26:03.480]   They have a good product.
[01:26:03.480 --> 01:26:04.480]   They're charging before anybody.
[01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:05.480]   I know.
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:06.480]   Three years ago, they could put it on a pillow.
[01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:07.480]   It would charge up.
[01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:08.480]   Unbelievable.
[01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:12.520]   They also have, unfortunately, a very nice operating system, Windows Phone, which isn't
[01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:13.520]   going anywhere.
[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:14.520]   No.
[01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:15.520]   This is the Hail Mary right now.
[01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:16.960]   This is the last ditch effort.
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:20.440]   We make iOS developers and Android developers comfortable moving.
[01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:21.440]   Yep.
[01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:25.000]   We, we, we, we're going to put a, they are giving away Windows 10 so that they can get
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:26.400]   a billion people using it.
[01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:29.560]   This is a Hail Mary to save Windows Phone.
[01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:30.560]   It's not kind of.
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:31.560]   And it's a universal app.
[01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:34.160]   It's putting an app for a Windows PC.
[01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:36.520]   It will also work on a Windows tablet and a Windows phone.
[01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:38.160]   The Surface is an incredible product too.
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:39.160]   You think about that.
[01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:43.600]   You know, if Microsoft sticks with it, they get it right in version 3, 4, 5 typically.
[01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:47.600]   So we also saw this story where Word Perfect was so much better than Microsoft, but Microsoft
[01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:49.880]   Word 4 or 5, you couldn't tell the difference.
[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:50.880]   Right.
[01:26:50.880 --> 01:26:51.880]   Surface 3, great product.
[01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:52.880]   People who have it love it.
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:53.880]   Yep.
[01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:55.440]   And they sold a billion of them last quarter or something crazy.
[01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:56.440]   Did they really?
[01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:57.440]   Wow.
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:26:58.440]   Yeah.
[01:26:58.440 --> 01:26:59.440]   I mean, if they stick with something, they eventually get there.
[01:26:59.440 --> 01:27:02.160]   iOS app now, Outlook is fantastic.
[01:27:02.160 --> 01:27:03.160]   Word.
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:06.560]   I opened up Word for the first time in five years just because it was available.
[01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:08.880]   And I was like, wow, Word is pretty tight on iPad.
[01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:12.080]   It's a very different app on the iPad.
[01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:15.440]   So is there going to be inside for Windows or Windows Phone?
[01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:16.800]   It's interesting you say that.
[01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:20.800]   I think if they gave us some kind of a deal like in bundling, we would definitely consider
[01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:24.640]   doing it, but not just yet.
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:26.800]   And so the desktop is really interesting.
[01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:33.240]   If you look at Slack and HipChat, they both made desktop clients because it's a great
[01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:34.240]   marketing tool.
[01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:37.040]   You can get all those Windows people and there's not a lot of competition there.
[01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:39.800]   So I think you'll see it on the enterprise stuff first and then consumer segment.
[01:27:39.800 --> 01:27:45.240]   I want to step right up and say there will be a Twitch app on Windows 10 because the
[01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:49.760]   guy who developed it, who works for Microsoft, works in the tools division, Dimitri Laiallin
[01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:52.120]   was here on Friday after build.
[01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:55.880]   And he said, I am rewriting the Twitter app in Xamel.
[01:27:55.880 --> 01:27:57.280]   It's going to be a universal app.
[01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:00.680]   So it'll work on Windows 10, Windows Phone and Xbox.
[01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:02.520]   And he's going to open source it.
[01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:03.520]   So we're thrilled.
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:07.000]   I mean, one of the things that we've been doing is we're in the midst of a website redesign.
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:10.720]   I've talked about this before where Drupal, which has been running our website, will be
[01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:11.720]   headless.
[01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:13.400]   It won't, you won't be interacting with Drupal directly.
[01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:20.200]   It will be an API engine that will offer a fairly rich, much richer than RSS API to
[01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:21.560]   our content.
[01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:26.640]   And we're going to Dimitri and Craig Mullaney, who's in the chat room who wrote the iOS app,
[01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:29.640]   are already going to in the API, looking at our API.
[01:28:29.640 --> 01:28:31.480]   They're going to write these apps to this API.
[01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:33.160]   Even our website will be a consumer of the API.
[01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:36.080]   It's going to be a node.js, but consuming the API.
[01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:39.560]   And I think that this is what's happening, isn't it?
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:41.560]   You're starting to see this move.
[01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:47.680]   So it's really what's great about the cloud is it doesn't care what OS you're using.
[01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:48.680]   No.
[01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:49.680]   It really doesn't matter.
[01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:51.200]   The inside is built on an API as well.
[01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:53.400]   So whenever we fire up a new app, and we're going to make it public.
[01:28:53.400 --> 01:28:54.400]   Makes it easy, doesn't it?
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:55.400]   Yeah.
[01:28:55.400 --> 01:28:57.760]   So anybody will be able to just hit and say, give me the top 10 stories from drones from
[01:28:57.760 --> 01:29:00.320]   the last month or tell me who the top 10 drones and what others are.
[01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:03.200]   And you want users coding and anybody can do it on any platform.
[01:29:03.200 --> 01:29:08.440]   What you think is now they made .NET open source, which was a big awesome move, I think,
[01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:12.320]   because there's so many people who use that in the enterprise.
[01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:14.600]   But is Windows going to ever be open source?
[01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:16.600]   Have they given any insight to that?
[01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:19.840]   Because Windows became wide that it might happen, really, the micro-centivature.
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:20.840]   You said something about that.
[01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:23.080]   The Azure guy said, you wouldn't be surprised.
[01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:24.600]   I don't think that's ever going to happen.
[01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:27.640]   But more likely to happen now than under a ballroom.
[01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:31.880]   There have got to be proprietary pieces in that code that Microsoft can't just open
[01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:34.400]   up, that they license that they use.
[01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:35.600]   Stuff that license?
[01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:39.120]   I have a feeling that that's just not legally possible.
[01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:40.120]   Possible.
[01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:41.120]   Possible.
[01:29:41.120 --> 01:29:42.120]   It's just not doable.
[01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:44.320]   But I do think it's interesting that they're making .NET more widely available.
[01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:48.480]   Do you as an investor when you go and come along and you look at a startup?
[01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:52.320]   If they're on Azure.NET, is that a mark against them?
[01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:53.320]   You don't care.
[01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:59.800]   No, the state of the art in terms of startups is you just pick one platform and do it perfectly.
[01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:03.880]   So I've seen people start on Android, get it perfect, take a year, piss off all the iOS
[01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:05.440]   people and then go to iOS.
[01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:09.520]   I've seen many more people do iOS only, piss off all the Android people, and then they
[01:30:09.520 --> 01:30:11.440]   get it right and then they move over there.
[01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:15.360]   Because what happens is if you try to build an app on three or four platforms at once,
[01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:16.360]   you can't do it.
[01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:21.400]   Because then every mistake you do, you've now magnified four times you'll run out of money.
[01:30:21.400 --> 01:30:23.680]   And so where people start is very interesting.
[01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:26.720]   It used to be you have to start on iOS, then it became, "Hey, Android's got more people."
[01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:30.760]   Now it's kind of back to iOS first because those are the best early adopters.
[01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:36.600]   I have to say one of Microsoft's challenges is to this day, usually when I meet with somebody
[01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:41.400]   who has a cool new mobile app, you know, if it can be done on iOS, iOS is almost like
[01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:42.400]   first.
[01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:46.840]   You ask about Android, sometimes Android ships at the same time, but very often Android
[01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:48.320]   is a few months later.
[01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:53.280]   And sometimes even Android is, well, you know, we're intrigued by the Android opportunity,
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:54.920]   blah, blah, blah.
[01:30:54.920 --> 01:30:58.560]   If it's tough to do Android, which has more users than anybody, it's really tough for
[01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:02.000]   Windows Phone, which is very distant number three.
[01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:04.600]   Here's the inside thing that's going on.
[01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:06.720]   Satji has been spending a lot of time here.
[01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:07.720]   So without going into too much detail.
[01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:09.160]   He seems to like San Francisco.
[01:31:09.160 --> 01:31:10.560]   He's coming down here a lot.
[01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:12.160]   He's they've had numerous appearances.
[01:31:12.160 --> 01:31:14.480]   And when he comes down, who's he talking to?
[01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:17.080]   He's been coming down and doing a lot of meetings with startups.
[01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:20.240]   So he'll come down, he'll meet with 10 startups in a day and go back.
[01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:25.320]   And I think you'll see the center of gravity start to shift a little bit to Seattle.
[01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:27.520]   No, no, I think you're going to see Seattle to hear.
[01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:29.920]   So I think you're going to see a lot more activity in San Francisco.
[01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:32.640]   You and I hear Jason Calicanas move to San Francisco.
[01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:33.640]   Exactly.
[01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:38.520]   No, but you could see a lot of executives being based here and a lot of different products
[01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:41.760]   being based here that may be weren't based here.
[01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:43.000]   I love the story.
[01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:46.080]   And I don't know whether it's true that they would acquire cyanogen.
[01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:49.760]   And they'd be able to literally by doing so flip a switch and say, you know, all those
[01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:52.200]   Lumia phones, they're Android phones now.
[01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:53.600]   And they're the best cameras.
[01:31:53.600 --> 01:31:54.600]   The best hardware.
[01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:56.000]   Were there cyanogen phones?
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.280]   You know, it's like, well, it's like, well, it's Android, right?
[01:31:58.280 --> 01:31:59.280]   It's like OSP.
[01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:00.280]   Yeah.
[01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:01.280]   Very interesting.
[01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:05.960]   But you don't have to see the thing is when now you, you know, Google's so hypocritical
[01:32:05.960 --> 01:32:08.040]   where they're like, oh, everything's got to be open.
[01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:11.600]   Except for search, which would make a black box to our own advantage and the FTC and you
[01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:12.880]   were going to get us on that.
[01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:16.160]   Then they're like, oh, no, but you know, Android's of course, totally open until we get market
[01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:17.160]   shares.
[01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:19.360]   And now we're going to make everything you have to use search.
[01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:21.160]   You have to use Google maps.
[01:32:21.160 --> 01:32:22.160]   You have to use stuff.
[01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:23.960]   So Google's completely hypocritical.
[01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:25.440]   And now you have Microsoft who's losing.
[01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:26.920]   Wouldn't it be amazing?
[01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:29.280]   We're the open company.
[01:32:29.280 --> 01:32:30.280]   Exactly.
[01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:31.280]   Well, you know what?
[01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:32.280]   That'd be amazing.
[01:32:32.280 --> 01:32:33.280]   You're closed when you're winning.
[01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:34.280]   Right.
[01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:35.280]   And when you're losing your open ding, ding, ding.
[01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:36.280]   That's the bottom line.
[01:32:36.280 --> 01:32:37.280]   I love that.
[01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:40.520]   All of Fence versus defense.
[01:32:40.520 --> 01:32:41.520]   Yeah.
[01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:43.480]   Yeah, I'm learning so much in this show.
[01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:44.480]   This is fantastic.
[01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:45.480]   Good episode.
[01:32:45.480 --> 01:32:48.360]   We don't have to talk about this story, but just can I drop it in and show somebody
[01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:49.360]   catches it later.
[01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:53.480]   They've made a stingray box that lets people know that they're being stingrayed.
[01:32:53.480 --> 01:32:57.440]   I don't know if people know what stingrays are, but the government's flying little bots
[01:32:57.440 --> 01:32:59.960]   over your house and they're picking up all your cellular data.
[01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:01.440]   And now we got something you can detect to it.
[01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:02.440]   That's all.
[01:33:02.440 --> 01:33:05.840]   Which is a good thing because apparently now the source code for creating a stingray is
[01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:10.760]   so widely available that any idiot with a PC can make his own stingray.
[01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:16.760]   So the stingray poses as a cell tower and grabs your phone briefly just to see where
[01:33:16.760 --> 01:33:18.760]   you're doing what you're up to.
[01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:23.080]   And then the problem is you can't make any phone calls while the stingrays got you.
[01:33:23.080 --> 01:33:25.440]   So then they pass you back to the cell tower.
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:26.440]   Good.
[01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:27.440]   I'm glad to hear that.
[01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:28.440]   If only we had to worry.
[01:33:28.440 --> 01:33:30.440]   Yeah, I see they were taking everything.
[01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:31.440]   I'm going to put it down.
[01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:32.440]   I'm going to get you.
[01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:33.440]   Yeah.
[01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:34.440]   I see you.
[01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:35.440]   That's the NSH.
[01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:36.440]   I'm at 1064.
[01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:37.440]   Just drop it down.
[01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:38.440]   I was talking to Nick Sin.
[01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:39.440]   I'm the bomb in the right eye.
[01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:40.440]   So I think I want to get in on that.
[01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:41.440]   I want to know.
[01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:43.440]   I don't know if I want to know.
[01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:46.440]   And I'm busy finding my tin foil hat.
[01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:47.440]   Yeah.
[01:33:47.440 --> 01:33:49.440]   Assume everything is compromised.
[01:33:49.440 --> 01:33:50.440]   That's basically it, right?
[01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:51.440]   Assume everything is.
[01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:55.440]   I don't put anything in email that I would not want plastered on the cover of the New
[01:33:55.440 --> 01:33:56.440]   York Times.
[01:33:56.440 --> 01:33:58.440]   Everything is already compromised.
[01:33:58.440 --> 01:33:59.440]   You have already been compromised.
[01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:02.360]   Do not take naked pictures ever on your phone.
[01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:03.360]   It's compromised.
[01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:05.360]   I got a whole naked picture system actually.
[01:34:05.360 --> 01:34:07.360]   Wait a minute.
[01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:10.240]   Oh, and tell us about that.
[01:34:10.240 --> 01:34:13.360]   So basically if you want to ask me.
[01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:14.360]   No way, stop.
[01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:16.600]   Oh, I'm just saying I can make sure nobody ever gets hacked again.
[01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:17.600]   I got a system.
[01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:18.600]   A system still proof.
[01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:19.600]   What is it?
[01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:20.600]   I'm just saying you don't want to help people.
[01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:25.440]   Look, so instead of keeping it directly on your phone, you say, you make a random email
[01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:26.880]   with Joe bomb jibbie on it.
[01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:27.880]   Okay.
[01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:28.880]   So somebody happens to find it.
[01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:29.880]   They're not going to think it's you or care.
[01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:30.880]   Right.
[01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:31.880]   You take the pictures, you send it to yourself.
[01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:33.680]   You take the pictures, you recall it to yourself.
[01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:37.280]   And as far as you having a significant other, so am I important?
[01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:40.680]   You just like do something, make them do something so weird that if they ever went against
[01:34:40.680 --> 01:34:43.400]   you, you could blackmail them or they could lose their job with it like that.
[01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:45.400]   That's very, I think this is the new.
[01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:46.400]   I'm just saying.
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:48.280]   This is the new prenup.
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:49.280]   This is the new prenup.
[01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:53.080]   If we're going to be in a relationship, I need a highly compromising picture of you.
[01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:54.800]   And I'll give you a highly compromising picture.
[01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:58.080]   Actually, you know, these scumbags who were doing this revenge porn stuff, that guy got
[01:34:58.080 --> 01:34:59.080]   15 years.
[01:34:59.080 --> 01:35:00.080]   Thank God.
[01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:01.080]   So great.
[01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:02.080]   Yes.
[01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:04.720]   Well, you know, it's people forget like they think, well, just because I'm doing this criminal
[01:35:04.720 --> 01:35:08.440]   activity on a digital platform, that it's not criminal, it doesn't matter.
[01:35:08.440 --> 01:35:09.640]   It's like, yeah, I can just make stock road.
[01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:10.640]   It's digital.
[01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:12.680]   Well, of course he would post a picture and then we offer you would black.
[01:35:12.680 --> 01:35:14.000]   Five thousand to take it to pay me.
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:15.000]   I won't put it up.
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:16.640]   And he's going to jail for 15, 20 years.
[01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:18.800]   Thank God the justice system is working.
[01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:19.800]   That's what he gets.
[01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:20.800]   Thank God.
[01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:21.800]   And then, you know, they're making all these laws now.
[01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:27.040]   So if you actually do this to your ex, husband, wife, girlfriend, boyfriend, whatever,
[01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:30.440]   you're going to go to jail and you're going to get in a lot of trouble.
[01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:36.680]   And rightfully so because these poor young kids are so naive that they're being incredibly
[01:35:36.680 --> 01:35:41.800]   terrible stories where some girl sends a, you know, one photo that's compromised and
[01:35:41.800 --> 01:35:46.480]   then they blackmail them into doing even more, you know, horrible stuff.
[01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:50.720]   And you know, then they say, Oh, we're going to send this to your family over Facebook
[01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:54.200]   because we know who your family is and these people are going to go to jail.
[01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:57.440]   And that's fantastic that these prosecutors are going after these people in my mind.
[01:35:57.440 --> 01:35:58.440]   Yeah.
[01:35:58.440 --> 01:35:59.440]   Because it's a horrible thing.
[01:35:59.440 --> 01:36:03.840]   We're giving children these technologies and even adults and really, you know, up until
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:07.600]   24 year frontal lobes, the part of your brain that deals with, you know, consequences to
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:09.880]   actions has not yet been formed.
[01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:13.040]   Everyone thinks it's funny and enjoyable.
[01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:14.960]   And once it's out there, it's out there forever.
[01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:19.800]   And the damage that it does in people's lives is absolutely devastating.
[01:36:19.800 --> 01:36:23.000]   Because people are, I mean, these young kids are killing themselves over it.
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:24.000]   Yes.
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:25.000]   Yes.
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:26.000]   Yes.
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:27.000]   And there's poor gay kid in New York, right in Jersey.
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.000]   Yes.
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.640]   And it's like, people think it's just a huge joke.
[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:31.640]   It's not.
[01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:32.640]   And you're prefrontal lobe.
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:34.800]   You don't have any idea of long term consequences.
[01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:38.400]   I mean, we also have those people take loans that can never be back.
[01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:39.400]   Yeah.
[01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:41.400]   And the same time that they're frontal.
[01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:42.400]   That's more.
[01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:43.400]   That's more.
[01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:44.400]   Even a bill.
[01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:45.400]   Let's go.
[01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:46.400]   24 will lend you as much money as you want.
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:47.400]   Yeah.
[01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:48.400]   And a large.
[01:36:48.400 --> 01:36:50.640]   By the way, if you go bankrupt, those are the ones that have loans that don't counter
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:51.640]   to your personal bankruptcy.
[01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:52.640]   Yeah.
[01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:53.640]   Nice.
[01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:54.640]   Very nice.
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:55.640]   Let's take a break.
[01:36:55.640 --> 01:36:56.640]   There's lots more to talk about.
[01:36:56.640 --> 01:37:00.480]   I'm not sure to end, but I'm afraid we do have to end it at some point.
[01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:01.480]   Why are you looking at your watch?
[01:37:01.480 --> 01:37:02.480]   Are you anxious?
[01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:03.480]   No.
[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:04.480]   It's probably saying.
[01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:05.480]   No, it's kind of like notifications.
[01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:08.120]   What are you getting sent out of the cases?
[01:37:08.120 --> 01:37:10.120]   Did you wear movers here?
[01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:13.920]   You're trying to get these kind of guys to pay 90 bucks to watch a boxing match.
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:15.520]   I didn't watch it.
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:17.360]   I just won't watch that.
[01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:18.360]   Here's the thing.
[01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:20.720]   I know that Floyd Mayweather is going to do the same thing every fight.
[01:37:20.720 --> 01:37:21.720]   He's going to go like this.
[01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:23.480]   He's going to throw three punches, win the round, and go like this.
[01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:24.480]   It's not worth watching.
[01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:26.600]   Mike Tyson, I'll pay 90 bucks every time to watch him.
[01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:27.600]   He's going to kill somebody in 30 seconds.
[01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:29.920]   Well, and now you can watch on Periscope or Meerkat for free.
[01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:30.920]   Exactly.
[01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:32.400]   So you steal it.
[01:37:32.400 --> 01:37:34.920]   It was weird, though, because it was kind of like horizontal.
[01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:35.920]   You can ask.
[01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:36.920]   No, it's tough.
[01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:37.920]   They did the crime.
[01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:38.920]   This is the person who said lamb's been boring for you.
[01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:41.920]   The fact that you were saying lamb's shit.
[01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:46.440]   The fact that you could get it, they made $180 million to take punches for 12 rounds.
[01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:47.440]   Blows my mind.
[01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:49.720]   If somebody pays us $10 million, I think you and I should go.
[01:37:49.720 --> 01:37:50.720]   I would do it.
[01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:51.720]   Yeah, I'd do it.
[01:37:51.720 --> 01:37:52.720]   Somebody puts up $10 million.
[01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:53.720]   We're going 12.
[01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:54.720]   I won't even know.
[01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:55.720]   I'll do it.
[01:37:55.720 --> 01:37:56.720]   We'll go right out there.
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:37:57.720]   No, really?
[01:37:57.720 --> 01:37:58.720]   No, really?
[01:37:58.720 --> 01:37:59.720]   Whoa.
[01:37:59.720 --> 01:38:00.720]   I know where I go.
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:01.720]   My first shot's going.
[01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:02.720]   All right, that's 15 million.
[01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:03.720]   That's 50.
[01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:04.720]   All right.
[01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:05.720]   Let's talk about.
[01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:06.720]   I've had my children.
[01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:08.880]   Talk about square space, square space.
[01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:11.360]   I use square space for all the launch festival sites.
[01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:12.360]   You use everything.
[01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:14.520]   Well, no, I use square space because it's the best product.
[01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:15.520]   It's a great design.
[01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:19.080]   And then I don't have to hire technical people to use to update the website.
[01:38:19.080 --> 01:38:21.240]   So launch festival, the launch scale conference.
[01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:22.640]   You really use square space for all that?
[01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:23.640]   100% square space.
[01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:25.200]   That's the best endorsement ever.
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:26.200]   Here's why.
[01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:29.720]   When I'm like, hey, put up a page, I don't have to find a developer and pay them $400
[01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:30.720]   to do it.
[01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:32.520]   And then square space keeps releasing new features.
[01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:33.520]   Like they added commerce.
[01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:34.840]   I don't know if you know that.
[01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:36.960]   And they also added calendars.
[01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:40.320]   So we can do our calendar and we can do our commerce right on the site.
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:44.920]   So if you have, you don't have to put magento or Shopify or any other software in it.
[01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:45.920]   It just all happens with that.
[01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:46.920]   What are they using?
[01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:47.920]   They're using something really good.
[01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:48.920]   No, no, it's built in.
[01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:49.920]   They built their own.
[01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:50.920]   It works.
[01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:51.920]   It's amazing.
[01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:52.920]   Yeah.
[01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:53.920]   It is a fantastic product square space.
[01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:56.360]   And it starts at only a couple of dollars a month.
[01:38:56.360 --> 01:38:59.440]   And if you use the promo code, oh my god.
[01:38:59.440 --> 01:39:00.440]   Really?
[01:39:00.440 --> 01:39:01.440]   Yeah.
[01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:02.880]   Oh, I, you know, promo code is Twitch.
[01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:04.360]   $8 a month.
[01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:07.280]   $8 a month, but you get 10% off and you use a promo code.
[01:39:07.280 --> 01:39:09.280]   But it's responsive design too, by the way.
[01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:10.280]   Yes.
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:11.520]   So if you're using mobile or anything like that, it just works.
[01:39:11.520 --> 01:39:14.640]   It looks gorgeous on iPad, phone, out of the gate.
[01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:15.640]   Gorgeous.
[01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:17.800]   The best help ever, right from the offices in New York.
[01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:18.800]   24.
[01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:19.800]   Yep, 24/7.
[01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:21.000]   Email and chat.
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:24.880]   I just, I mean, I'm glad you brought up the e-commerce because I think what they're doing
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:25.880]   is so great.
[01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:29.600]   They've got every square space site, even the $8 a month site, has e-commerce.
[01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:32.480]   So if you want to do donations or, I mean, that's pretty incredible.
[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:35.840]   What's one of the great things about like a SaaS space business like this is they keep
[01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:37.360]   making and adding features to it.
[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:40.320]   When they add a feature, everybody who has the product gets it, right?
[01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:41.320]   And so that's sweet.
[01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:42.320]   Yeah.
[01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:43.320]   It's fantastic.
[01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:44.320]   We should make that clear.
[01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:45.320]   It's hosting.
[01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:46.320]   You're paying for it's a web host.
[01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:47.320]   Yeah.
[01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:48.320]   But you also use their software.
[01:39:48.320 --> 01:39:49.320]   So the software is always up to date.
[01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:53.840]   So every day I get up in the morning and see is there a patch for my WordPress site?
[01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:56.120]   It's an endless process.
[01:39:56.120 --> 01:39:57.120]   That's the previous paradigm, right?
[01:39:57.120 --> 01:39:58.120]   Yeah.
[01:39:58.120 --> 01:39:59.120]   And it's just broken.
[01:39:59.120 --> 01:40:00.120]   Yeah.
[01:40:00.120 --> 01:40:03.200]   Squarespace.com, easy offer code, Twit, 10% off your first purchase.
[01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:05.840]   Jason Calicanis, great to have you back.
[01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:07.880]   You're the best for our sponsors ever.
[01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:10.040]   God, I mean, if you had an audible list, I would tell you.
[01:40:10.040 --> 01:40:11.200]   What are you listening to?
[01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:14.920]   I have this amazing book that I'm going to do, Season of the Witch by Dave Talbot.
[01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:16.640]   It's about the history of San Francisco.
[01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:17.640]   Oh.
[01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:20.360]   Dave Talbot did Salon or Slate.
[01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:21.360]   Yes.
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:22.360]   One of the two he--
[01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:23.360]   I love Dave Talbot.
[01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:24.360]   Yeah, he was the examiner of the Chronicle.
[01:40:24.360 --> 01:40:25.360]   He was one of the--
[01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:26.760]   Just a great, great, great person.
[01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:27.760]   Oh, man.
[01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:28.760]   But you could save this for your next one.
[01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:29.760]   Season of the Witch.
[01:40:29.760 --> 01:40:30.760]   I'm absolutely outstanding.
[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:36.360]   And then Sam Harris has a great one called "Waking Up."
[01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:37.360]   Amazing.
[01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:39.320]   Sam Harris, the guy who wrote Letter to Christian Nation.
[01:40:39.320 --> 01:40:40.320]   And he's just amazing.
[01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:41.960]   But this book, Season of the Witch.
[01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:43.600]   Now, when do you listen to you listening to?
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:45.760]   I was listening to it on the drive up here.
[01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:46.760]   I want to have a commute again.
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:47.760]   Here's what it is.
[01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:51.760]   Whenever I'm driving, whenever I'm on an airplane, and whenever I'm working out, I listen to
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:52.760]   it.
[01:40:52.760 --> 01:40:53.760]   Yeah.
[01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:56.440]   And so I try to go on the treadmill for, you know, whatever, an hour every other day,
[01:40:56.440 --> 01:40:57.440]   an hour and a half.
[01:40:57.440 --> 01:40:58.440]   Yep.
[01:40:58.440 --> 01:40:59.440]   And that's what I listen to.
[01:40:59.440 --> 01:41:00.440]   Season of the Witch.
[01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:01.440]   Amazing.
[01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:02.440]   I just bought it.
[01:41:02.440 --> 01:41:03.440]   Well, I had two credits.
[01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:04.440]   See, I try to keep those credits--
[01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:05.440]   I'm platinum.
[01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:06.440]   You're platinum?
[01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:07.440]   Of course I'm platinum.
[01:41:07.440 --> 01:41:08.440]   Platinum.
[01:41:08.440 --> 01:41:09.440]   Platinum.
[01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:10.440]   That's two books a month.
[01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:11.440]   Two books a month.
[01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:12.440]   I listen to about half a book.
[01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:13.440]   So amazing.
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:14.440]   I just finished the Steve Jobs book, becoming Steve Jobs.
[01:41:14.440 --> 01:41:15.440]   Oh, I did get--
[01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:16.440]   I didn't go that one yet.
[01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:17.920]   I really enjoyed its perspective.
[01:41:17.920 --> 01:41:23.920]   I wish that instead of telling us the characteristics that he has, they just explained to us and
[01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:25.560]   allowed us to decide on our own.
[01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:27.560]   That would be my one quip in the book.
[01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:29.200]   Well, that's because you're a psychotherapist.
[01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:33.760]   And I know that that's the worst thing is this kind of amateur diagnosis stuff.
[01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:36.640]   What's the best thing, George, are we going to do to be more present in our lives?
[01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:39.240]   You have some tips for us, addicted to phones and stuff like that?
[01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:40.240]   Yeah.
[01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:44.840]   I think that the one thing that everyone should do is to try to be where you are right now
[01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:49.760]   and start of thinking about always going forward into the past or into the present.
[01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:53.200]   You want to be just where you are right now and make the most of those moments that you
[01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:56.840]   have because if you live in the past, you're dealing with regret.
[01:41:56.840 --> 01:42:00.120]   And if you're living in the future, you're dealing with anxiety and you're missing all
[01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:01.280]   the good stuff.
[01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:04.840]   Time slows down when you're in the here and now, just doing what you're doing now and
[01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:07.640]   trying to be the best and get the most out of it.
[01:42:07.640 --> 01:42:08.640]   Romdas, baby.
[01:42:08.640 --> 01:42:09.640]   Be here now.
[01:42:09.640 --> 01:42:10.640]   That's why I'm meditating.
[01:42:10.640 --> 01:42:11.640]   Yeah.
[01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:12.640]   One-hundredth.
[01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:13.640]   That's great.
[01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:14.640]   That's great.
[01:42:14.640 --> 01:42:15.640]   All the entrepreneurs are doing that.
[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:16.640]   It's a fad.
[01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:19.440]   I'd say it's a fad that I've been doing it for three or four years.
[01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:20.440]   It's really painful.
[01:42:20.440 --> 01:42:21.440]   It's actually...
[01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:22.440]   It's really works in terms of focus.
[01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:24.440]   Yeah, and it's amazing for your brain.
[01:42:24.440 --> 01:42:25.440]   Yeah.
[01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:28.360]   Like for your brain, if you meditate every day, they did studies.
[01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:32.600]   And these aren't studies at like some Hokie, you know, Crystal's kind of university.
[01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:33.680]   These are universities that are big.
[01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:37.680]   They did studies having people meditate for 20 minutes a day versus people that didn't.
[01:42:37.680 --> 01:42:42.840]   And they were 50 years old and they tested them in a year and their brains were tested
[01:42:42.840 --> 01:42:44.640]   for the people that meditated.
[01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:47.320]   They were tested as if they were 40 one years old.
[01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:48.320]   Wow.
[01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:50.320]   So if you want to meditate or is that not...
[01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:51.320]   No, I'm not.
[01:42:51.320 --> 01:42:52.720]   That's the opposite of being present.
[01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:54.320]   I'm getting behind a game of thrones.
[01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:55.320]   I need to...
[01:42:55.320 --> 01:42:58.480]   Oh, you have to do game of thrones and meditate after.
[01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:01.920]   This is the best advice I got on meditation, which was, you know, I was like, oh my God,
[01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:03.400]   it's so complicated or whatever.
[01:43:03.400 --> 01:43:07.120]   And somebody who does it was like, you know, if you...
[01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:08.120]   It's like going in the ocean.
[01:43:08.120 --> 01:43:10.760]   If you dip your feet in the ocean, you actually experience the ocean.
[01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:11.760]   Yeah.
[01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:13.520]   And then you can do a scuba dive, right?
[01:43:13.520 --> 01:43:16.560]   So just going up to your knees in the ocean, that's actually experiencing the ocean.
[01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:21.000]   So if you do a five-minute meditation and there's a woman named Diana Winston from UCLA
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:24.040]   who runs the mindfulness and trains the meditators down there and she has these two
[01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:31.440]   albums for free on iTunes and on her website, Diana Winston UCLA, amazing and free.
[01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:32.440]   Do you...
[01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:33.440]   And you can do other types.
[01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:36.960]   You can do passive relaxation, which is more active.
[01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:40.160]   And you can do things like guided imagery, but I don't do long meditations either.
[01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:41.880]   I do something really short, sweet.
[01:43:41.880 --> 01:43:43.680]   Yeah, 12 minutes, 5 minutes, 20.
[01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:44.680]   And then I'm an investor.
[01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:45.680]   You can do it's better than not doing it.
[01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:46.680]   Com.com.
[01:43:46.680 --> 01:43:47.680]   I'm going to do Call of Duty.
[01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:48.680]   Com.com.
[01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:49.680]   You put money...
[01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:50.680]   I think Com.com is cool.
[01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:52.840]   I put 400 grand into Com.com.
[01:43:52.840 --> 01:43:54.200]   Nobody would invest in it.
[01:43:54.200 --> 01:43:58.040]   And now I can't say exactly what the company's doing, but it's now gone to millions of years
[01:43:58.040 --> 01:43:59.040]   a year.
[01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:00.040]   I paid for it.
[01:44:00.040 --> 01:44:01.040]   I got a year's subscription.
[01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:03.400]   The company's worth five times what I invest in my investment in at.
[01:44:03.400 --> 01:44:04.400]   Wow.
[01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:05.400]   And it is taking over because if you think about yoga...
[01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:06.400]   Look at it.
[01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:07.400]   It's so calm.
[01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:08.400]   If you come to the...
[01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:09.400]   It's something you had to...
[01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:11.080]   It seemed like crazy that everybody would do yoga.
[01:44:11.080 --> 01:44:15.000]   Now you go to any hotel that have yoga classes every day.
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:18.920]   And yoga has to be delivered in person, but meditation can be delivered in your earbuds.
[01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:20.120]   Do you have like a mantra?
[01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:21.120]   Do you do...
[01:44:21.120 --> 01:44:22.120]   What do you do?
[01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:23.120]   No, I do the mindful stuff.
[01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:24.120]   Because that mantra stuff, I think...
[01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:26.400]   You're a go-home, money-pad, me-home.
[01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:27.400]   You don't need to do that.
[01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:29.000]   You just have to be in a quiet place.
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:30.000]   You're present.
[01:44:30.000 --> 01:44:31.480]   And what you're trying to do is calm your mind.
[01:44:31.480 --> 01:44:32.480]   Do you close your eyes?
[01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:34.480]   I do close my eyes and I put my hands on my knees.
[01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:35.480]   Sit on a little pillow.
[01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:37.480]   And you can do it laying down or sitting, but you have to fill your body.
[01:44:37.480 --> 01:44:38.480]   If I lay down, I'll fall asleep.
[01:44:38.480 --> 01:44:40.920]   Can I just say that I'm just chasing you every day?
[01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:42.920]   It's called falling asleep.
[01:44:42.920 --> 01:44:43.920]   I usually go for it.
[01:44:43.920 --> 01:44:45.920]   20 to 40 minutes and I shout it out to you.
[01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:46.920]   You're exceptional about it.
[01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:47.920]   You're exceptional about it.
[01:44:47.920 --> 01:44:48.920]   Let's do it.
[01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:49.920]   Let's do it.
[01:44:49.920 --> 01:44:50.920]   Let's study naps.
[01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:51.920]   It would be the same thing.
[01:44:51.920 --> 01:44:52.920]   Turn your...
[01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:53.920]   It's similar.
[01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:54.920]   It's similar to that.
[01:44:54.920 --> 01:44:55.920]   Turn your phone off.
[01:44:55.920 --> 01:44:56.920]   Turn the iPad off.
[01:44:56.920 --> 01:44:57.920]   No.
[01:44:57.920 --> 01:44:58.920]   Turn the TV off.
[01:44:58.920 --> 01:44:59.920]   Look at the ceiling or the back of your eye.
[01:44:59.920 --> 01:45:00.920]   That's probably why you have the answer.
[01:45:00.920 --> 01:45:01.920]   You gotta get off the side.
[01:45:01.920 --> 01:45:02.920]   You gotta get off the side.
[01:45:02.920 --> 01:45:03.920]   You can't do it.
[01:45:03.920 --> 01:45:04.920]   You have to.
[01:45:04.920 --> 01:45:05.920]   You have to.
[01:45:05.920 --> 01:45:09.040]   You were supposed to take your data and take it, but I think about it overnight when I go
[01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:10.040]   to sleep.
[01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:11.960]   I think about the exercise I was going to do.
[01:45:11.960 --> 01:45:14.560]   And the next thing I fall asleep, peaceful is a mouse.
[01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:18.200]   You wake up, you have your hand in the bag of Cheetos.
[01:45:18.200 --> 01:45:20.840]   My best tip for you is, when I go to dinner with my friends now...
[01:45:20.840 --> 01:45:22.320]   You don't have food in the bed at night.
[01:45:22.320 --> 01:45:23.480]   That's a good advice too.
[01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:24.480]   I like it.
[01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:26.960]   At dinner, when I go to dinner with my friends now, we have a rule.
[01:45:26.960 --> 01:45:28.320]   Everybody puts their phone in the middle of the table.
[01:45:28.320 --> 01:45:30.440]   First person to touch their phone during dinner pays for dinner.
[01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:31.440]   I love it.
[01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:32.440]   And we'll put us back, six of them there.
[01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:33.440]   I bet it's hard.
[01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:34.440]   Oh my God.
[01:45:34.440 --> 01:45:35.440]   The first half hour is hard.
[01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:39.760]   Then you get into our 90 minutes and you're talking to your friends and you're in the moment
[01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:41.480]   and you're like, "Oh my God, this is what life used to be like."
[01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:42.920]   We used to actually listen to each other.
[01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:44.920]   We actually talk to each other.
[01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:45.920]   Exactly.
[01:45:45.920 --> 01:45:46.920]   But you know, you're speaking.
[01:45:46.920 --> 01:45:50.480]   I'm going to announce my retirement from the internet today.
[01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:51.760]   I'm going home.
[01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:52.760]   That's big news.
[01:45:52.760 --> 01:45:53.760]   That's big news right there.
[01:45:53.760 --> 01:45:54.760]   For how long though?
[01:45:54.760 --> 01:45:55.760]   For how long, Leo?
[01:45:55.760 --> 01:45:56.760]   A minute too.
[01:45:56.760 --> 01:45:57.760]   I don't know.
[01:45:57.760 --> 01:46:00.840]   I don't think this is going to work for me.
[01:46:00.840 --> 01:46:04.400]   See, that's my biggest pet peeve though, is when we go out to eat or if people are
[01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:05.800]   with a round and they're on their phone.
[01:46:05.800 --> 01:46:06.800]   Oh, I hate that.
[01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:07.800]   And I love technology.
[01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:08.800]   I want to punch it.
[01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:09.800]   But that I can't stand.
[01:46:09.800 --> 01:46:12.160]   I bug Renee about it every single time we go out.
[01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:13.800]   I watch him and I'm like, "Really?
[01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:14.800]   You have to do that now?"
[01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:15.800]   Oh, the ironic.
[01:46:15.800 --> 01:46:16.800]   It's the same thing I do.
[01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:17.800]   Another great tip.
[01:46:17.800 --> 01:46:18.800]   It's an anniversary.
[01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:21.240]   When I take my daughter for a brunch or breakfast or something, I'll leave the phone at home.
[01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:22.240]   I'll tell my wife where I'm going.
[01:46:22.240 --> 01:46:25.920]   I'm going to go here for breakfast and then I'll come back and I leave the devices at
[01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:27.360]   home.
[01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:28.880]   I know that's a very hard thing.
[01:46:28.880 --> 01:46:32.720]   But Leo, trust me, take your wife to dinner and leave your phone.
[01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:33.720]   She will love you.
[01:46:33.720 --> 01:46:34.720]   You'll get lucky.
[01:46:34.720 --> 01:46:35.720]   Trust me.
[01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:36.720]   And you leave your phone at home.
[01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:38.720]   I told my wife, "I'm leaving my phone at home.
[01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:40.720]   I just want to just totally listen to you."
[01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:41.720]   She's like, "I love you."
[01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:43.720]   I was like, "You love me again?"
[01:46:43.720 --> 01:46:44.720]   Really?
[01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:46.720]   I should have left my phone and have a look down ago.
[01:46:46.720 --> 01:46:49.440]   Leo, your phone are people.
[01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:50.440]   You hate people.
[01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:51.920]   So disconnect from those people.
[01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:52.920]   It's a fair fight.
[01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:53.920]   He got you.
[01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:54.920]   Dr. Got you.
[01:46:54.920 --> 01:46:55.920]   He got you.
[01:46:55.920 --> 01:46:57.720]   All the people that shoot on my and leave your phone at home.
[01:46:57.720 --> 01:47:00.520]   I'll take a purse from the internet once a month because you've got to go.
[01:47:00.520 --> 01:47:01.920]   I'm breaking into a sweat.
[01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:02.920]   I am actually sweating.
[01:47:02.920 --> 01:47:07.320]   If you're that anxious for leaving your phone at home, you have a problem.
[01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:08.320]   You feel fine.
[01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:10.320]   Hi, I'm Leo Leport and I am addicted to the internet.
[01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:11.320]   Oh, I have such a problem.
[01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:13.520]   When I come out here, I'm feeling hyping all your devices.
[01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:15.480]   Hey, we got some good news.
[01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:16.480]   This just got handed to me.
[01:47:16.480 --> 01:47:20.000]   Neil Young will be joining us on triangulation tomorrow.
[01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:22.680]   As you know, I'm a Pono player owner.
[01:47:22.680 --> 01:47:23.680]   Kickstarted it.
[01:47:23.680 --> 01:47:24.680]   I'm a fan.
[01:47:24.680 --> 01:47:26.240]   I think high-res music is very interesting.
[01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:29.120]   And of course, Neil Young is one of the greats of all time.
[01:47:29.120 --> 01:47:30.120]   Is it God?
[01:47:30.120 --> 01:47:31.920]   I'm flipping my lids.
[01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:32.920]   It'll be via Skype.
[01:47:32.920 --> 01:47:36.360]   So don't run into the studio, but we will be talking to Neil Young.
[01:47:36.360 --> 01:47:37.360]   Tomorrow morning, 11 a.m.
[01:47:37.360 --> 01:47:39.360]   They actually said, "Is that okay?"
[01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:40.360]   Yes.
[01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:41.360]   I want to keep.
[01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:46.360]   I've been a minor for a heart of gold.
[01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:49.360]   Do we have to pay royalties if y'all keep saying it?
[01:47:49.360 --> 01:47:50.360]   Man needs a maid.
[01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:51.360]   That's all I can say.
[01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:55.360]   Ladies and gentlemen, if you missed, this was a very important week at Twit because we
[01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:58.800]   launched a new show, a show we've never done before.
[01:47:58.800 --> 01:48:03.320]   In fact, I think Brandon, it's the first TV show we've ever done on Twit.
[01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:04.320]   And that's it.
[01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:05.600]   Yeah, like a TV show.
[01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:07.440]   These are all radio shows with pictures.
[01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:08.440]   Yeah.
[01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:10.280]   Ladies and gentlemen, TV show.
[01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:12.960]   Here's what you missed if you missed anything this week on Twit.
[01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:14.720]   Previously on Twit.
[01:48:14.720 --> 01:48:19.240]   Live from the Twit Brick House in beautiful downtown Petaluma, it's the new screen saver.
[01:48:19.240 --> 01:48:21.240]   Welcome to the screen savers.
[01:48:21.240 --> 01:48:22.240]   I'm Leo LaPortz.
[01:48:22.240 --> 01:48:23.240]   And I'm Pabidorz.
[01:48:23.240 --> 01:48:24.240]   My old pal.
[01:48:24.240 --> 01:48:25.880]   You know, it's Twit's first TV show.
[01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:31.000]   It's hard to hug over the Netcam network, but you know, it's a little off.
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:36.040]   Before you buy, Samsung Galaxy S6 is a phenomenal phone and it's one of my favorites of the year
[01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:37.040]   right now.
[01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:42.080]   And without a doubt, this is the best camera that I've used on an Android device.
[01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:43.080]   Windows Weekly.
[01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:44.560]   I am very excited about HoloLens.
[01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:46.480]   You know, I put it over my head and I took it on.
[01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:48.400]   I said that is not what it looked like in January.
[01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:49.880]   All you can see is this little thing in front of you.
[01:48:49.880 --> 01:48:51.200]   So the video is following you over here.
[01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:52.360]   You can't see it.
[01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:55.360]   I mean...
[01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:56.360]   Gizwiz.
[01:48:56.360 --> 01:49:01.480]   What do you think was the most dangerous thing you ever did on the show?
[01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:03.840]   You remember the skates, the orbits skates?
[01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:07.640]   Avoid steep inclines and don't ride too fast.
[01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:09.880]   I would also avoid flat surfaces.
[01:49:09.880 --> 01:49:14.720]   This is like skating with the wheels of the point of something.
[01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:15.720]   Twit.
[01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:16.720]   Like Tech TV.
[01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:17.720]   Only better.
[01:49:17.720 --> 01:49:20.720]   Sorry, I was about to say something foul on the principle on camera.
[01:49:20.720 --> 01:49:21.720]   It's okay.
[01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:22.960]   It's not a TV show, it's just a podcast.
[01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:24.560]   Nonetheless, there's a certain family.
[01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:26.160]   A friendly expectation here.
[01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:28.040]   That's their story and we're sticking to it.
[01:49:28.040 --> 01:49:31.080]   Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Leo LaPorte.
[01:49:31.080 --> 01:49:32.080]   What a fun week we had.
[01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:37.040]   And of course, the new screensabers is back every Saturday, 2pm Pacific.
[01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:40.080]   I'm sorry, 3pm Pacific, 6pm Eastern time 2100 UTC.
[01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:43.680]   You can watch live, but we'll get it on the feeds pretty quickly after that.
[01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:47.200]   It was a little slow this first time because we wanted to make it just right.
[01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:53.680]   If you want to subscribe, twit.tv/tnss.
[01:49:53.680 --> 01:49:55.840]   Grooshark shut down.
[01:49:55.840 --> 01:49:56.840]   And they had to apologize.
[01:49:56.840 --> 01:49:58.280]   I know that was so embarrassing.
[01:49:58.280 --> 01:50:01.040]   They were like, "You're going to shut down and then you're going to apologize.
[01:50:01.040 --> 01:50:02.200]   Then we're going to cut your head off."
[01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:03.680]   It was the music industry's response.
[01:50:03.680 --> 01:50:05.480]   That's why they're the best in music companies.
[01:50:05.480 --> 01:50:06.480]   Never.
[01:50:06.480 --> 01:50:09.200]   And they tell you to go off and pay for your music from some other service.
[01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:10.200]   And they...
[01:50:10.200 --> 01:50:11.200]   How did they survive for eight years?
[01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:13.800]   It was kind of the thing I wondered.
[01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:15.000]   Investment money, I guess.
[01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:16.000]   They probably had some VC money.
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:17.000]   So they were...
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:21.560]   Grooshark allowed you to listen to streaming music that you didn't own, but they did not
[01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:23.280]   pay any royalties to the music industry.
[01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:26.800]   It was like you'd upload songs and share them just like SoundCloud can, but they didn't
[01:50:26.800 --> 01:50:31.800]   have content ID like YouTube did to automatically take stuff down and claim stuff.
[01:50:31.800 --> 01:50:32.800]   So...
[01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:37.800]   They were served in 2011 with a $17 billion lawsuit.
[01:50:37.800 --> 01:50:39.200]   I saw the music industry.
[01:50:39.200 --> 01:50:41.280]   $250,000 per infringement.
[01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:42.280]   Wow.
[01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:43.280]   It adds up quick.
[01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:44.280]   Wow.
[01:50:44.280 --> 01:50:51.680]   So the apology that they were required to publish said that that was wrong.
[01:50:51.680 --> 01:50:54.280]   We apologize with that reservation.
[01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:59.040]   They said our hearts were in the right place, but we did many bad things.
[01:50:59.040 --> 01:51:03.280]   Grooshark has agreed to wipe clean all of the record company's copyright works, handover
[01:51:03.280 --> 01:51:07.120]   ownership of their website, their mobile apps, their intellectual property, including our
[01:51:07.120 --> 01:51:09.520]   patents and copyrights.
[01:51:09.520 --> 01:51:12.480]   So everything they work for, like they're like, not only do we have to apologize and shut
[01:51:12.480 --> 01:51:15.040]   down, we have to give you everything we made.
[01:51:15.040 --> 01:51:16.040]   Wow.
[01:51:16.040 --> 01:51:17.040]   This is why the music industry is...
[01:51:17.040 --> 01:51:18.040]   But who are they giving it to?
[01:51:18.040 --> 01:51:19.040]   Dick Vive?
[01:51:19.040 --> 01:51:20.040]   Dick Vive.
[01:51:20.040 --> 01:51:21.040]   It gets it.
[01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:22.040]   It gets a bit too hard.
[01:51:22.040 --> 01:51:23.040]   Yeah.
[01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:24.040]   No.
[01:51:24.040 --> 01:51:25.040]   They're just so vindictive.
[01:51:25.040 --> 01:51:26.040]   I mean, it's like...
[01:51:26.040 --> 01:51:27.040]   Yeah.
[01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:29.600]   You could have seen this coming though.
[01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:30.600]   Of course.
[01:51:30.600 --> 01:51:31.600]   I can't believe...
[01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:33.320]   I was surprised the day Grooshark launched.
[01:51:33.320 --> 01:51:35.200]   Pandora is like hanging on by a thread.
[01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:36.200]   Really?
[01:51:36.200 --> 01:51:37.200]   Because they pay royalties.
[01:51:37.200 --> 01:51:39.760]   They pay royalties, but then they only give them like a four-year...
[01:51:39.760 --> 01:51:40.760]   They're making our thoughts.
[01:51:40.760 --> 01:51:43.180]   I think they give them four years, and they've been paying half.
[01:51:43.180 --> 01:51:45.520]   They've been paying like a half deal.
[01:51:45.520 --> 01:51:47.000]   And now that's gonna end.
[01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:48.960]   And when it doubles, then they'll be underwater again.
[01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:53.960]   But Tim Westergren's point is, look, radio stations aren't paying as much as you're asking
[01:51:53.960 --> 01:51:54.960]   us to pay.
[01:51:54.960 --> 01:51:55.960]   Right.
[01:51:55.960 --> 01:51:56.960]   How are we different?
[01:51:56.960 --> 01:51:57.960]   Isn't this the radio station in the 21st century?
[01:51:57.960 --> 01:52:00.960]   Isn't this how you discover music that's good for the industry?
[01:52:00.960 --> 01:52:01.960]   Yeah.
[01:52:01.960 --> 01:52:02.960]   The fact that you can switch and hit the next button, I guess.
[01:52:02.960 --> 01:52:04.960]   But you're gonna do it a couple of times.
[01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:05.960]   Anyway...
[01:52:05.960 --> 01:52:06.960]   Yeah.
[01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:07.960]   It's all...
[01:52:07.960 --> 01:52:10.160]   You know, the music industry has moved so slow.
[01:52:10.160 --> 01:52:11.160]   Can they push too hard?
[01:52:11.160 --> 01:52:14.760]   Can the music industry push so hard that they really chase away their audience?
[01:52:14.760 --> 01:52:16.060]   And that people just say, "Screw you.
[01:52:16.060 --> 01:52:17.060]   I'm not buying..."
[01:52:17.060 --> 01:52:20.220]   And it's gonna get music from people that don't make music?
[01:52:20.220 --> 01:52:21.220]   Well, no.
[01:52:21.220 --> 01:52:22.380]   Musicians instead of labels.
[01:52:22.380 --> 01:52:23.380]   Well, yeah.
[01:52:23.380 --> 01:52:24.740]   I mean, YouTube has been the ultimate hack.
[01:52:24.740 --> 01:52:26.500]   Kids are listening to music on YouTube.
[01:52:26.500 --> 01:52:28.300]   Like kids, that's all they listen to.
[01:52:28.300 --> 01:52:29.300]   Yeah.
[01:52:29.300 --> 01:52:30.300]   I listen to music on YouTube.
[01:52:30.300 --> 01:52:31.300]   Yeah.
[01:52:31.300 --> 01:52:33.820]   So that, I mean, if you go to YouTube and you type in Bob Dylan or you're young, you can
[01:52:33.820 --> 01:52:34.820]   listen to a lot of great songs.
[01:52:34.820 --> 01:52:35.820]   I'll ask him about that.
[01:52:35.820 --> 01:52:38.980]   He may not be too happy about that.
[01:52:38.980 --> 01:52:40.460]   Secret is going away.
[01:52:40.460 --> 01:52:41.620]   The anonymous social app.
[01:52:41.620 --> 01:52:43.380]   This isn't much of a surprise either.
[01:52:43.380 --> 01:52:44.380]   Yeah.
[01:52:44.380 --> 01:52:45.380]   Secret.
[01:52:45.380 --> 01:52:47.580]   All of these, you must have, George, seen it.
[01:52:47.580 --> 01:52:50.060]   Well, yeah, George, what do you think of that in terms of people...
[01:52:50.060 --> 01:52:51.540]   Anonymous posting was just...
[01:52:51.540 --> 01:52:54.300]   Is there value in that existing in the world in any way?
[01:52:54.300 --> 01:52:55.300]   Right.
[01:52:55.300 --> 01:52:56.300]   Yeah, I don't.
[01:52:56.300 --> 01:52:57.300]   I don't really.
[01:52:57.300 --> 01:52:58.300]   I'm not really into it.
[01:52:58.300 --> 01:52:59.740]   I never, like, that's what I get paid to do that.
[01:52:59.740 --> 01:53:00.740]   I don't want it.
[01:53:00.740 --> 01:53:01.740]   That's not fun for me to think about it.
[01:53:01.740 --> 01:53:03.740]   You hear people's secrets all the time.
[01:53:03.740 --> 01:53:04.740]   Right.
[01:53:04.740 --> 01:53:05.740]   It's not fun to listen to people's problems.
[01:53:05.740 --> 01:53:09.220]   I know they're in my circle group and like, is it real?
[01:53:09.220 --> 01:53:10.220]   Is it not?
[01:53:10.220 --> 01:53:11.220]   I don't need that stress.
[01:53:11.220 --> 01:53:13.900]   So I don't find any value to it.
[01:53:13.900 --> 01:53:18.860]   There are some people, I'm sure, that feel great, like, you know, saying whatever hurt
[01:53:18.860 --> 01:53:23.580]   and wounds they have to others and the salacious value of, like, being on a moray show without
[01:53:23.580 --> 01:53:26.300]   actually being on a moray show.
[01:53:26.300 --> 01:53:28.740]   But it does not bother me in only going away.
[01:53:28.740 --> 01:53:29.740]   I don't know.
[01:53:29.740 --> 01:53:30.740]   I read it for...
[01:53:30.740 --> 01:53:35.540]   I died in Stahlton and read it for a while and felt bad about it and deleted it.
[01:53:35.540 --> 01:53:36.540]   Yeah.
[01:53:36.540 --> 01:53:40.140]   And I think really the real reason it went out of business wasn't because it was bad for
[01:53:40.140 --> 01:53:43.580]   the world, but because it was just Silicon Valley posting about others.
[01:53:43.580 --> 01:53:44.580]   Because people...
[01:53:44.580 --> 01:53:45.580]   It was not something...
[01:53:45.580 --> 01:53:49.700]   Now, what about Nick Yak or these college focused apps?
[01:53:49.700 --> 01:53:50.700]   These aren't going under.
[01:53:50.700 --> 01:53:51.700]   These aren't going away.
[01:53:51.700 --> 01:53:54.500]   Secret did this weird redesign or it basically dumped everything that was interesting about
[01:53:54.500 --> 01:53:55.500]   secret and became yuk-yak.
[01:53:55.500 --> 01:53:56.500]   Yeah.
[01:53:56.500 --> 01:53:57.500]   They pivoted to yuk-yak.
[01:53:57.500 --> 01:54:01.900]   And after that, it was at least when I checked in every few weeks, it was...
[01:54:01.900 --> 01:54:05.580]   Go-secret was interesting when it was a website and coffee table books.
[01:54:05.580 --> 01:54:09.620]   But when you put it in an app and your real situation in the circle of people, then you
[01:54:09.620 --> 01:54:10.620]   start feeling weird about it.
[01:54:10.620 --> 01:54:11.780]   You start feeling a certain way.
[01:54:11.780 --> 01:54:12.780]   And it's too close to home.
[01:54:12.780 --> 01:54:15.580]   And then you got people trying to think about, "Well, who is this person?
[01:54:15.580 --> 01:54:16.580]   I should help this person."
[01:54:16.580 --> 01:54:17.820]   You get feel good in your heart.
[01:54:17.820 --> 01:54:20.620]   You're like, "Okay, well, this person is somewhere in my vicinity."
[01:54:20.620 --> 01:54:22.300]   And they're talking about doing this to themselves.
[01:54:22.300 --> 01:54:23.300]   I need to help them.
[01:54:23.300 --> 01:54:24.100]   That's a stress-
[01:54:24.100 --> 01:54:26.900]   The intent really matters when you build these startups.
[01:54:26.900 --> 01:54:28.900]   And I think their intent was to make a bunch of money.
[01:54:28.900 --> 01:54:31.500]   In fact, they took a lot of money off the table.
[01:54:31.500 --> 01:54:33.340]   And that was the really weird thing is I remember this is...
[01:54:33.340 --> 01:54:34.340]   It took $6 million off the table.
[01:54:34.340 --> 01:54:35.340]   Oh, yeah.
[01:54:35.340 --> 01:54:36.340]   I passed on investing.
[01:54:36.340 --> 01:54:37.340]   Obviously, I didn't want to be associated with it.
[01:54:37.340 --> 01:54:38.340]   But they...
[01:54:38.340 --> 01:54:39.340]   Some of my friends invested.
[01:54:39.340 --> 01:54:41.380]   These guys took $3 million each off the table.
[01:54:41.380 --> 01:54:44.660]   And it was for my understanding a requirement to invest in it was for them to be able to
[01:54:44.660 --> 01:54:45.660]   take this $3 million.
[01:54:45.660 --> 01:54:46.660]   This is not unusual.
[01:54:46.660 --> 01:54:50.220]   Founders will sometimes say, "Look, I want to get something for my efforts.
[01:54:50.220 --> 01:54:51.940]   So I'm going to take some of the investment."
[01:54:51.940 --> 01:54:52.940]   In year four of five, Leo.
[01:54:52.940 --> 01:54:57.540]   If a founder in year four of five gets an offer for 100 million from Facebook, the venture
[01:54:57.540 --> 01:55:00.820]   capitalists or angels might say, "Hey, we'll buy some shares for you so you can buy your
[01:55:00.820 --> 01:55:03.460]   house and you have idiot insurance against it going to zero."
[01:55:03.460 --> 01:55:04.460]   Right.
[01:55:04.460 --> 01:55:06.460]   And so that's reasonable if you've built a $100 million business.
[01:55:06.460 --> 01:55:07.460]   Right.
[01:55:07.460 --> 01:55:08.460]   Sure, we'll buy two or $3 million shares from you.
[01:55:08.460 --> 01:55:09.900]   And then we get the upside from here.
[01:55:09.900 --> 01:55:13.940]   The problem is these guys did it in their A round when the product was improving at
[01:55:13.940 --> 01:55:16.780]   all as the price of admission, it set off all kinds of red flags.
[01:55:16.780 --> 01:55:17.780]   Yeah, but they're smart, right?
[01:55:17.780 --> 01:55:18.780]   I mean, they got those really much.
[01:55:18.780 --> 01:55:21.340]   Well, I mean, there also might be Huxters and fraudsters.
[01:55:21.340 --> 01:55:26.700]   And, you know, so it kind of felt like none of the employees got to do it.
[01:55:26.700 --> 01:55:27.700]   Only the two founders got to do it.
[01:55:27.700 --> 01:55:29.700]   In fact, they didn't even tell these employees.
[01:55:29.700 --> 01:55:30.700]   Yeah, the employees read about it.
[01:55:30.700 --> 01:55:31.700]   Yes, secret.
[01:55:31.700 --> 01:55:36.020]   It was really, really done.
[01:55:36.020 --> 01:55:37.780]   It set a horrible precedent.
[01:55:37.780 --> 01:55:38.780]   Yeah.
[01:55:38.780 --> 01:55:41.100]   You know, I'm an investor in a company called Whisper, which is sort of the good version
[01:55:41.100 --> 01:55:45.140]   of this, which is Whisper didn't take your address book and say, "Hey, let's spread
[01:55:45.140 --> 01:55:46.340]   rumors amongst your address book."
[01:55:46.340 --> 01:55:47.340]   Right.
[01:55:47.340 --> 01:55:50.740]   It just said, "Tell me something about yourself that you want the world to know and we'll
[01:55:50.740 --> 01:55:53.860]   share it by location if you choose to do that, all opt in.
[01:55:53.860 --> 01:55:57.140]   So people who maybe were in the closet or maybe had anxiety about something going on
[01:55:57.140 --> 01:55:59.820]   the lives could use it as a way to share it.
[01:55:59.820 --> 01:56:03.380]   Then people would write comments of support and you could start discussions with them."
[01:56:03.380 --> 01:56:04.380]   Right.
[01:56:04.380 --> 01:56:08.580]   Whisper has this much like post-secret, which I think is a lot of the inspiration for these
[01:56:08.580 --> 01:56:09.580]   services.
[01:56:09.580 --> 01:56:12.460]   It was a way for people, I guess, and I'm interested in George's position on this, but
[01:56:12.460 --> 01:56:16.900]   a way to sort of release that energy and share it with people and maybe be heard, just
[01:56:16.900 --> 01:56:18.940]   like therapy can in a safe way.
[01:56:18.940 --> 01:56:25.060]   But Seeker was designed, take your address book, and we're all going to talk SH about
[01:56:25.060 --> 01:56:26.620]   our friends.
[01:56:26.620 --> 01:56:27.940]   And boy, was it nasty in there.
[01:56:27.940 --> 01:56:28.940]   It was nasty.
[01:56:28.940 --> 01:56:29.940]   It was really.
[01:56:29.940 --> 01:56:30.940]   They claimed they were doing that to be at the moment.
[01:56:30.940 --> 01:56:36.260]   And when someone's acting strange to you, they're like, "Are you sure you're okay?
[01:56:36.260 --> 01:56:37.660]   You want to take that other glass of wine?"
[01:56:37.660 --> 01:56:38.820]   And you're like, "Why are they doing that?"
[01:56:38.820 --> 01:56:41.660]   And probably it was just someone else's secret that caused them some stress.
[01:56:41.660 --> 01:56:42.660]   But they thought it was you.
[01:56:42.660 --> 01:56:43.660]   Yeah.
[01:56:43.660 --> 01:56:44.660]   I had to say some stuff about me on it.
[01:56:44.660 --> 01:56:45.660]   I know it is.
[01:56:45.660 --> 01:56:47.740]   You start putting on other people.
[01:56:47.740 --> 01:56:49.740]   That's a whole problem inside of itself.
[01:56:49.740 --> 01:56:51.500]   Yeah, I had people say some stuff about it.
[01:56:51.500 --> 01:56:56.300]   I'm a public figure, so I immediately wrote comments and I said, "This is Jason Calicanis.
[01:56:56.300 --> 01:56:59.380]   If you have a problem with me, I'm sure I could have pissed you off something I wrote
[01:56:59.380 --> 01:57:00.380]   or something I did.
[01:57:00.380 --> 01:57:02.020]   I'm not a perfect human being, far from it.
[01:57:02.020 --> 01:57:03.020]   Why don't you email me?
[01:57:03.020 --> 01:57:04.020]   I'll have a cup of coffee.
[01:57:04.020 --> 01:57:05.660]   I don't really want to have any of these things out there.
[01:57:05.660 --> 01:57:07.460]   I'd rather just resolve them and move on.
[01:57:07.460 --> 01:57:08.460]   Life is short.
[01:57:08.460 --> 01:57:10.460]   I lost a good friend of mine, Dave Goldberg this past week.
[01:57:10.460 --> 01:57:11.460]   Hey, let's talk about that.
[01:57:11.460 --> 01:57:13.180]   In fact, we'll wrap up with that.
[01:57:13.180 --> 01:57:14.180]   That is a shocker.
[01:57:14.180 --> 01:57:16.380]   47 years old.
[01:57:16.380 --> 01:57:18.060]   The husband of Cheryl Sandberg.
[01:57:18.060 --> 01:57:19.060]   Yeah.
[01:57:19.060 --> 01:57:20.580]   They have two small children.
[01:57:20.580 --> 01:57:22.980]   I think 11 and then a nine.
[01:57:22.980 --> 01:57:26.300]   He was CEO of SurveyMonkey, but also--
[01:57:26.300 --> 01:57:27.300]   Doing tremendous.
[01:57:27.300 --> 01:57:28.700]   He had done launch.com.
[01:57:28.700 --> 01:57:29.700]   He sold a team.
[01:57:29.700 --> 01:57:30.700]   Launch, right.
[01:57:30.700 --> 01:57:31.700]   And he was an angel investor.
[01:57:31.700 --> 01:57:32.700]   He was one of my dear friends.
[01:57:32.700 --> 01:57:33.700]   Shocking.
[01:57:33.700 --> 01:57:35.100]   I just spent the day yesterday in shock.
[01:57:35.100 --> 01:57:38.460]   I was very young, very sad.
[01:57:38.460 --> 01:57:43.700]   He was the guy who was the nicest guy at our poker game and he was the guy who--
[01:57:43.700 --> 01:57:44.700]   You really knew him.
[01:57:44.700 --> 01:57:45.700]   He was a match.
[01:57:45.700 --> 01:57:48.220]   I mean, I literally played poker with him on Wednesday night and we have a tradition
[01:57:48.220 --> 01:57:49.220]   in the poker game.
[01:57:49.220 --> 01:57:51.300]   We play and you need to draw for seats.
[01:57:51.300 --> 01:57:54.660]   And as fate would have it, he drew the seat next to me and we sat there all night and
[01:57:54.660 --> 01:57:55.660]   laughed.
[01:57:55.660 --> 01:57:59.100]   We had 200, 200 other times we played cards together.
[01:57:59.100 --> 01:58:04.540]   It's just like if you made a list of all the guys in the poker game, you get older in
[01:58:04.540 --> 01:58:05.540]   your life.
[01:58:05.540 --> 01:58:08.580]   One of the things for the people who are young in the audience, you deal with a lot
[01:58:08.580 --> 01:58:09.580]   of people in your life.
[01:58:09.580 --> 01:58:10.580]   Maybe you don't want to deal with.
[01:58:10.580 --> 01:58:14.060]   As you get older, you get the choice to pick who you want to hang out with.
[01:58:14.060 --> 01:58:16.780]   The good people gravitate towards each other and you hang out.
[01:58:16.780 --> 01:58:20.700]   And amongst that good group of people who play cards every week for the last decade or
[01:58:20.700 --> 01:58:23.220]   so, he was the best guy.
[01:58:23.220 --> 01:58:26.460]   He was the best dad, best husband, best leader.
[01:58:26.460 --> 01:58:28.380]   And in fact, he designed Survey Monkey.
[01:58:28.380 --> 01:58:29.620]   I remember talking to him about this.
[01:58:29.620 --> 01:58:33.220]   He said, "You know, Jason, I'm designing Survey Monkey as the place you can go and still
[01:58:33.220 --> 01:58:34.940]   have a life and have kids."
[01:58:34.940 --> 01:58:38.940]   And that's my pitch to people who come work for me is, "Come here and have a life."
[01:58:38.940 --> 01:58:44.180]   And he would just, he was the kind of guy who would just talk to you for hours about
[01:58:44.180 --> 01:58:45.180]   you.
[01:58:45.180 --> 01:58:47.540]   And you'd finally, I have to say, "What's going on at Survey Monkey and how can I help
[01:58:47.540 --> 01:58:48.540]   you?"
[01:58:48.540 --> 01:58:52.060]   You know, we went on a trip two weeks ago.
[01:58:52.060 --> 01:58:55.460]   A bunch of us went to Monsanto because one of our friends come and got bought by it and
[01:58:55.460 --> 01:58:58.780]   we played cards the whole way there and we learned about GMO foods.
[01:58:58.780 --> 01:59:02.100]   Just a most generous, amazing person.
[01:59:02.100 --> 01:59:06.020]   And I wrote about him this past week and Rob Goldberg, his brother, is a good friend
[01:59:06.020 --> 01:59:07.020]   of mine.
[01:59:07.020 --> 01:59:10.220]   You know what's interesting is how Facebook became the place where people gathered to
[01:59:10.220 --> 01:59:12.500]   talk to this and write about this.
[01:59:12.500 --> 01:59:17.700]   And for all the horrible things about Facebook and all the bad things I've said about it,
[01:59:17.700 --> 01:59:22.420]   it has turned out that in a couple of events, the Nepal earthquake where their safety check
[01:59:22.420 --> 01:59:25.860]   page has been so valuable.
[01:59:25.860 --> 01:59:29.260]   And now, this is the value of a social network.
[01:59:29.260 --> 01:59:33.020]   Yeah, no, I mean a lot of people coming out with the memories is, and you know, I just
[01:59:33.020 --> 01:59:34.020]   -- very powerful.
[01:59:34.020 --> 01:59:39.540]   -- to his family and everybody is, my heart goes out to them and it's -- it really makes
[01:59:39.540 --> 01:59:46.020]   you like really evaluate life and think about, you know, being a better person, you know.
[01:59:46.020 --> 01:59:49.700]   And he was, you know, when you talk about the word "mensch," you know, in the it ish,
[01:59:49.700 --> 01:59:51.980]   like a really good person who helps other people.
[01:59:51.980 --> 01:59:54.020]   This was the ubermensch, the mench of menchas.
[01:59:54.020 --> 01:59:57.700]   Like, he literally was the guy we all wanted to be a little bit more like.
[01:59:57.700 --> 02:00:01.380]   And so to Cheryl and the family, like, our hearts go out to you and I'm going to miss
[02:00:01.380 --> 02:00:02.380]   you Goldie.
[02:00:02.380 --> 02:00:03.820]   That's why his nickname is Goldie.
[02:00:03.820 --> 02:00:08.420]   And so it's really, really just tragic to die at that age.
[02:00:08.420 --> 02:00:09.420]   It's so young.
[02:00:09.420 --> 02:00:10.420]   And we was a really beautiful person.
[02:00:10.420 --> 02:00:11.940]   I'm going to miss him terribly.
[02:00:11.940 --> 02:00:16.140]   I'm really glad you could be here to share your tribute to him.
[02:00:16.140 --> 02:00:17.380]   And I thank you all for being here.
[02:00:17.380 --> 02:00:19.940]   I think that's a note we probably want to wrap up on Georgia.
[02:00:19.940 --> 02:00:21.340]   Wow, it's great to have you.
[02:00:21.340 --> 02:00:22.700]   Would you come back, please?
[02:00:22.700 --> 02:00:23.780]   I would love to.
[02:00:23.780 --> 02:00:30.500]   I'm more.com at Georgia_dow if you want to follow her on Twitter.
[02:00:30.500 --> 02:00:32.660]   Anything else you want to tell people about?
[02:00:32.660 --> 02:00:33.660]   Plug?
[02:00:33.660 --> 02:00:35.300]   No, I don't have anything to plug.
[02:00:35.300 --> 02:00:36.220]   I'm just so happy to be here.
[02:00:36.220 --> 02:00:37.220]   So thanks.
[02:00:37.220 --> 02:00:38.220]   Come back.
[02:00:38.220 --> 02:00:39.980]   You were a great addition to the show.
[02:00:39.980 --> 02:00:41.180]   Nice to have a psychologist here.
[02:00:41.180 --> 02:00:43.020]   Yeah, somebody can explain all this stuff.
[02:00:43.020 --> 02:00:44.020]   I don't know.
[02:00:44.020 --> 02:00:45.020]   Give us some advice.
[02:00:45.020 --> 02:00:46.020]   What do we do?
[02:00:46.020 --> 02:00:47.420]   I'm going to go home and meditate on the famous round.
[02:00:47.420 --> 02:00:48.900]   You guys need private sessions.
[02:00:48.900 --> 02:00:49.900]   You two are.
[02:00:49.900 --> 02:00:50.900]   That'll need private.
[02:00:50.900 --> 02:00:54.900]   I'm crazy, but I know I'm crazy.
[02:00:54.900 --> 02:00:56.540]   I know it's my heart, babe.
[02:00:56.540 --> 02:00:58.740]   You need to come back and loop it around.
[02:00:58.740 --> 02:01:01.860]   I mean Uncle Jason, Uncle Leo, the family feuds finally over.
[02:01:01.860 --> 02:01:02.860]   I mean, Lord help.
[02:01:02.860 --> 02:01:04.420]   A lot of people are relieved.
[02:01:04.420 --> 02:01:05.900]   A lot of people are relieved.
[02:01:05.900 --> 02:01:07.300]   People are so broken up about it.
[02:01:07.300 --> 02:01:09.700]   They're like, God, you guys did the best radio together.
[02:01:09.700 --> 02:01:10.700]   Well, it's more than that.
[02:01:10.700 --> 02:01:12.860]   I really like you and I always like you.
[02:01:12.860 --> 02:01:16.980]   I always thought you were the greatest guy and I apologize for being so small and heavy.
[02:01:16.980 --> 02:01:18.620]   And I could have done better myself.
[02:01:18.620 --> 02:01:20.060]   No, I don't think it's your fault.
[02:01:20.060 --> 02:01:21.060]   I take just a take.
[02:01:21.060 --> 02:01:23.260]   No, it's like you son of a bitch.
[02:01:23.260 --> 02:01:24.260]   I'm sorry.
[02:01:24.260 --> 02:01:25.260]   I love that guy.
[02:01:25.260 --> 02:01:26.820]   Oh, and JJ Stone, thank you so much.
[02:01:26.820 --> 02:01:27.820]   What do you want to plug?
[02:01:27.820 --> 02:01:30.420]   Your New Jersey mailbox, anything?
[02:01:30.420 --> 02:01:34.980]   I want to plug my daughter's college fund which is turned into my Tesla fund.
[02:01:34.980 --> 02:01:35.980]   I'm halfway there.
[02:01:35.980 --> 02:01:39.540]   So if anybody would like to contribute to the Tesla, I promise that once I get to
[02:01:39.540 --> 02:01:42.340]   the Tesla, I'll work back on the college fund.
[02:01:42.340 --> 02:01:45.620]   I mean, there are certain things I need to do in my lifestyle and getting that S is in
[02:01:45.620 --> 02:01:46.620]   my future.
[02:01:46.620 --> 02:01:47.620]   I love you, Uncle Leo.
[02:01:47.620 --> 02:01:48.620]   I love you.
[02:01:48.620 --> 02:01:49.620]   I love you, JJ.
[02:01:49.620 --> 02:01:50.620]   I love the chat room.
[02:01:50.620 --> 02:01:51.620]   The chat room.
[02:01:51.620 --> 02:01:52.620]   All the best people in the world.
[02:01:52.620 --> 02:01:53.620]   They don't be know what's going on there.
[02:01:53.620 --> 02:01:54.620]   I'll be talking to y'all.
[02:01:54.620 --> 02:01:55.620]   You'll be talking to me.
[02:01:55.620 --> 02:01:56.620]   It's great.
[02:01:56.620 --> 02:01:57.620]   And if he wants to charge us a dollar a year, Uncle Jason is going front, at least like one
[02:01:57.620 --> 02:01:58.620]   care.
[02:01:58.620 --> 02:01:59.620]   First month free on me.
[02:01:59.620 --> 02:02:03.420]   I'm so glad to take care of business.
[02:02:03.420 --> 02:02:04.420]   Yeah.
[02:02:04.420 --> 02:02:05.420]   All right.
[02:02:05.420 --> 02:02:07.980]   Harry McCracken is wondering what the hell am I doing here?
[02:02:07.980 --> 02:02:10.380]   The technology is your fast company.com.
[02:02:10.380 --> 02:02:11.380]   Always a pleasure.
[02:02:11.380 --> 02:02:12.460]   Great to have you here.
[02:02:12.460 --> 02:02:14.100]   Thank you for spending a little time with us.
[02:02:14.100 --> 02:02:15.100]   All of you.
[02:02:15.100 --> 02:02:19.820]   We do this show every Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time, 2200 UTC.
[02:02:19.820 --> 02:02:24.100]   We love it if you could join us live because despite appearances, I actually like the
[02:02:24.100 --> 02:02:25.100]   chat room too.
[02:02:25.100 --> 02:02:26.740]   It's full of people though.
[02:02:26.740 --> 02:02:28.380]   That's those people there.
[02:02:28.380 --> 02:02:29.380]   It is again.
[02:02:29.380 --> 02:02:30.380]   That's so I love you.
[02:02:30.380 --> 02:02:31.380]   Oh, no, he's having me.
[02:02:31.380 --> 02:02:32.380]   The chat room is made of people.
[02:02:32.380 --> 02:02:33.380]   It's people.
[02:02:33.380 --> 02:02:34.380]   It's people.
[02:02:34.380 --> 02:02:35.380]   It's people.
[02:02:35.380 --> 02:02:41.060]   We also make on demand of audio and video available after the fact.
[02:02:41.060 --> 02:02:42.060]   Twit.tv is the website.
[02:02:42.060 --> 02:02:45.540]   All our shows are there including the new screensavers, Twit, everything else.
[02:02:45.540 --> 02:02:49.660]   And wherever you get your podcasts, and that includes iTunes of course, but most people
[02:02:49.660 --> 02:02:52.420]   I think nowadays use the podcast app on their mobile device.
[02:02:52.420 --> 02:02:53.420]   That's fine with me.
[02:02:53.420 --> 02:02:58.940]   Don't forget we do have Twit apps written by members of the community, not by us on iOS,
[02:02:58.940 --> 02:03:02.860]   on Android, on Windows phone and on Roku.
[02:03:02.860 --> 02:03:03.860]   So please.
[02:03:03.860 --> 02:03:05.340]   It's Twitpad and official app or no?
[02:03:05.340 --> 02:03:06.340]   Everything's official.
[02:03:06.340 --> 02:03:07.340]   Okay.
[02:03:07.340 --> 02:03:08.340]   But they're...
[02:03:08.340 --> 02:03:09.340]   I like Twitpad.
[02:03:09.340 --> 02:03:10.340]   Twitpad's great.
[02:03:10.340 --> 02:03:11.340]   There's... you know what?
[02:03:11.340 --> 02:03:13.340]   In each platform there's actually several choices.
[02:03:13.340 --> 02:03:14.340]   I mean look at this.
[02:03:14.340 --> 02:03:15.980]   I mean somebody did that for free.
[02:03:15.980 --> 02:03:16.980]   Well yeah.
[02:03:16.980 --> 02:03:18.420]   They just did it because they're super fans.
[02:03:18.420 --> 02:03:22.060]   I think some people are charging these some ads and some of them, but I don't think they
[02:03:22.060 --> 02:03:23.060]   make a lot of money.
[02:03:23.060 --> 02:03:24.060]   The love.
[02:03:24.060 --> 02:03:26.500]   I feel the love in this room is amazing.
[02:03:26.500 --> 02:03:27.500]   Twitpad is amazing.
[02:03:27.500 --> 02:03:28.500]   I'm going to go sing.
[02:03:28.500 --> 02:03:29.500]   You'll never walk alone.
[02:03:29.500 --> 02:03:30.500]   I'm Leo Laport.
[02:03:30.500 --> 02:03:31.500]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:03:31.500 --> 02:03:32.500]   We'll see you next time.
[02:03:32.500 --> 02:03:33.500]   Another Twit is in the can.
[02:03:33.500 --> 02:03:34.500]   Bye bye everybody.
[02:03:34.500 --> 02:03:44.500]   I'm really glad that Goldie that you could...
[02:03:44.500 --> 02:03:45.500]   Talk about Goldie.
[02:03:45.500 --> 02:03:48.500]   I think that's fantastic because I didn't know them.
[02:03:48.500 --> 02:03:49.500]   True.
[02:03:49.500 --> 02:03:51.500]   I didn't either but I've been moving just pretty now.
[02:03:51.500 --> 02:03:52.500]   Yeah.
[02:03:52.500 --> 02:03:53.500]   No kidding.
[02:03:53.500 --> 02:03:54.500]   Yeah.
[02:03:54.500 --> 02:03:55.500]   It's very interesting.
[02:03:55.500 --> 02:04:00.500]   Like you know we live in a world like in this industry of like narcissistic you know.
[02:04:00.500 --> 02:04:07.740]   It's all about the singular person whether it's Elon or Satya or Bill Gates or whatever
[02:04:07.740 --> 02:04:08.740]   it is.
[02:04:08.740 --> 02:04:13.660]   And you know there's some people who just go about it in a quiet way and he was that
[02:04:13.660 --> 02:04:16.780]   guy who just went about in a quiet way and was a mensch.
[02:04:16.780 --> 02:04:18.780]   You know and we could all take a lesson.
[02:04:18.780 --> 02:04:19.780]   Wow.
[02:04:19.780 --> 02:04:21.700]   You know everybody take a note like bigger ears.
[02:04:21.700 --> 02:04:23.460]   They were overseas when it happened?
[02:04:23.460 --> 02:04:24.460]   Yeah.
[02:04:24.460 --> 02:04:26.460]   He was in Mexico.
[02:04:26.460 --> 02:04:28.300]   So it was just terrible.
[02:04:28.300 --> 02:04:33.420]   The best part about hearing you talk about a friend like that is it makes you think about
[02:04:33.420 --> 02:04:35.900]   yourself and think like man should I be doing better?
[02:04:35.900 --> 02:04:36.900]   I could be doing better.
[02:04:36.900 --> 02:04:40.780]   I was telling you about how that Elon must change my world earlier this week.
[02:04:40.780 --> 02:04:44.460]   You talk about somebody that you care about makes me think about the things that I do well
[02:04:44.460 --> 02:04:46.060]   and the things I should do better.
[02:04:46.060 --> 02:04:49.220]   And I gotta go hug my kid this week extra like extra.
[02:04:49.220 --> 02:04:50.220]   That was my yesterday.
[02:04:50.220 --> 02:04:51.220]   It was like...
[02:04:51.220 --> 02:04:53.220]   That's the biggest thing.
[02:04:53.220 --> 02:04:56.620]   People say I tell you why don't you live in New York or San Francisco and you should
[02:04:56.620 --> 02:04:57.620]   be.
[02:04:57.620 --> 02:04:58.620]   I can't leave my kid.
[02:04:58.620 --> 02:04:59.820]   I want to spend time with my kid.
[02:04:59.820 --> 02:05:01.060]   Like that's what matters to me.
[02:05:01.060 --> 02:05:05.620]   And I hope that one day somebody thinks I did a good job and like the way you talked about
[02:05:05.620 --> 02:05:06.620]   him that's great.
[02:05:06.620 --> 02:05:10.420]   It makes somebody who doesn't even know the guy feel for you and feel for that guy in
[02:05:10.420 --> 02:05:11.420]   his family.
[02:05:11.420 --> 02:05:15.220]   So it's rough.
[02:05:15.220 --> 02:05:19.780]   It's life is very perplexing you know.
[02:05:19.780 --> 02:05:24.300]   We gotta have the Padre on but you know it's very perplexing when the best person you know
[02:05:24.300 --> 02:05:25.300]   goes first.
[02:05:25.300 --> 02:05:28.460]   And that's the thing I've been just personally struggling with over the last 48 hours.
[02:05:28.460 --> 02:05:29.460]   It's just like why?
[02:05:29.460 --> 02:05:30.460]   Well, yeah.
[02:05:30.460 --> 02:05:33.860]   And it's just like you know what if I was talking to another friend who we play cards
[02:05:33.860 --> 02:05:39.660]   with David Sachs and we were just lamenting how like God if you if you took this list
[02:05:39.660 --> 02:05:41.820]   of like the great guys we'd all put him number one.
[02:05:41.820 --> 02:05:42.820]   Wow.
[02:05:42.820 --> 02:05:45.820]   And we would be like I told David I was like you and I would be like number seven, eight,
[02:05:45.820 --> 02:05:46.820]   nine on the list.
[02:05:46.820 --> 02:05:49.220]   Like we should go first.
[02:05:49.220 --> 02:05:52.900]   Like we just missed last like what is the guy who's the best go first.
[02:05:52.900 --> 02:05:57.700]   It doesn't make any sense and then you think oh gosh the poor kids are gonna have to grow
[02:05:57.700 --> 02:06:02.340]   up hearing these stories about how great their dad was and you know there's something
[02:06:02.340 --> 02:06:06.340]   horrible and tragic obviously but then it's also something great that his legacy I think
[02:06:06.340 --> 02:06:07.340]   is being captured.
[02:06:07.340 --> 02:06:09.500]   Like you said even the Facebook page was very powerful.
[02:06:09.500 --> 02:06:13.860]   I've spent at least an hour a day reading on the Facebook page or two hours a day maybe.
[02:06:13.860 --> 02:06:15.900]   That's a phenomenal thing that that exists.
[02:06:15.900 --> 02:06:17.500]   That's a really great thing to have.
[02:06:17.500 --> 02:06:18.500]   Yeah.
[02:06:18.500 --> 02:06:20.260]   And his kids can read this 20 years from now or 10 years from now.
[02:06:20.260 --> 02:06:24.340]   I think it's gonna be a yeah it's gonna be a misfove for them to be able to see like
[02:06:24.340 --> 02:06:27.740]   gosh my dad was especially.
[02:06:27.740 --> 02:06:28.740]   He was something.
[02:06:28.740 --> 02:06:32.620]   He was something and tremendous tremendous guy.
[02:06:32.620 --> 02:06:40.500]   This is hard to comprehend when I think you know you think about the unfairness of death
[02:06:40.500 --> 02:06:44.540]   right and this is something that I don't know any of us will ever be able to comprehend
[02:06:44.540 --> 02:06:49.940]   and after 9/11 I had this like very like existential crisis being a New Yorker and having been
[02:06:49.940 --> 02:06:55.740]   there of like why did these people die and how is it fair that these people die and what
[02:06:55.740 --> 02:06:59.820]   does it mean you know and you don't ever get over it but I think you can change the
[02:06:59.820 --> 02:07:05.300]   way you live and you can change the way you treat the people around you you know and a
[02:07:05.300 --> 02:07:08.180]   lot of you people know me because I'm a public person I haven't always been the best person
[02:07:08.180 --> 02:07:12.100]   I haven't always been nice to people in my writing I've been kind of a little bit of
[02:07:12.100 --> 02:07:15.940]   a brawler in my life and you know it's like I've been reassessing that over the last couple
[02:07:15.940 --> 02:07:20.020]   of years and trying to be a better person and better to other people right yeah what will
[02:07:20.020 --> 02:07:26.380]   be your legacy yeah that's the one lesson that you can take from from that is that like
[02:07:26.380 --> 02:07:29.660]   like our time is really precious here and and relatively fleeting and you don't know
[02:07:29.660 --> 02:07:32.700]   what cards you're gonna be dealt you can only say how am I gonna deal with the cards
[02:07:32.700 --> 02:07:38.020]   that I get and it's a really hard thing to deal with our culture does not deal exceptionally
[02:07:38.020 --> 02:07:44.340]   well with death we don't have really great means of helping people through it so you know
[02:07:44.340 --> 02:07:49.540]   it's nice Facebook and memorializing and talking about it is really helpful for everyone and
[02:07:49.540 --> 02:07:52.900]   Annie Lamont wrote a book all new people she said a hundred years it's all new people
[02:07:52.900 --> 02:07:57.860]   right yeah and what that really reminded me is that of course some of us go sooner than
[02:07:57.860 --> 02:08:03.260]   others we're all yeah we're all going sooner than later really yeah but what we have that's
[02:08:03.260 --> 02:08:07.860]   remarkable is we are all alive together in this space you know some but yep but that
[02:08:07.860 --> 02:08:12.420]   this was our cohort right of the people we got to share the planet with and it includes
[02:08:12.420 --> 02:08:17.980]   people like him like Goldie like Steve Jobs the people we know around us and and some
[02:08:17.980 --> 02:08:21.780]   of us are gonna go sooner than others but really we're all in this cohort that this
[02:08:21.780 --> 02:08:26.260]   is our group in a hundred years we're all gonna be gone yeah yeah we're all gonna be
[02:08:26.260 --> 02:08:32.980]   gone celebrate this cohort we overlap with some great people we were we have lived overlap
[02:08:32.980 --> 02:08:36.740]   with older folks and they'll overlap with people who aren't born yet yep but we've lived
[02:08:36.740 --> 02:08:40.500]   with some amazing people in our group and our group they did an amazing time these is an
[02:08:40.500 --> 02:08:47.140]   amazing amazing time it's like they I think it was the War of the Rings where GANF says
[02:08:47.140 --> 02:08:50.820]   like all you have to decide is like what to do with the time you're given I don't know
[02:08:50.820 --> 02:08:56.060]   I'm I'm bushing the quote but it always stuck with me like just we have this time we have
[02:08:56.060 --> 02:09:00.140]   to decide what we do with it right and it's it is kind of freeing in a way you have a limited
[02:09:00.140 --> 02:09:06.740]   amount of time and choose to do with it what you will but just know that it's limited you
[02:09:06.740 --> 02:09:11.100]   know I have this really deep conversation my wife and I was like you know what's all the
[02:09:11.100 --> 02:09:16.740]   success and all this like I lucked into so many different things in my life and what am
[02:09:16.740 --> 02:09:23.980]   I gonna do with this last 10 20 years or months or weeks or days like shit like I really
[02:09:23.980 --> 02:09:29.900]   started to think about long no matter what even if it's 40 years it just goes by it goes
[02:09:29.900 --> 02:09:35.660]   by really quickly the coolest thing that I ever learned was when I I did therapy at a
[02:09:35.660 --> 02:09:40.300]   very expensive old folks home so I was dealing with the movers of the shakers of the world
[02:09:40.300 --> 02:09:44.940]   people that were multi billionaires that ran huge companies and the one thing I took from
[02:09:44.940 --> 02:09:48.100]   it is that they were on the last part of their life and they didn't talk about their companies
[02:09:48.100 --> 02:09:52.540]   or how much stuff they had or how successful they were all they said is I wish I could
[02:09:52.540 --> 02:09:58.180]   spend it with those that I love for a little longer.
[02:09:58.180 --> 02:10:02.180]   It's interesting like people are like oh god you spent almost time playing cards you know
[02:10:02.180 --> 02:10:06.020]   and I'm like yeah I play cards but it's a social and I'm like you know what I see my
[02:10:06.020 --> 02:10:09.420]   I see my friends every week it's a social thing checking with my friends every week and
[02:10:09.420 --> 02:10:14.660]   we spend exactly you know eight eight nine hours playing a game and laughing our asses
[02:10:14.660 --> 02:10:18.100]   it's great you know and I was like it's not about the money the cards it's not it at all
[02:10:18.100 --> 02:10:22.500]   oh it was just always that it's about the cigars last note that I'm getting out of here
[02:10:22.500 --> 02:10:27.140]   yes are you waiting to care it at me what is your I wish I wish I was care to ship your
[02:10:27.140 --> 02:10:34.700]   carers any more cares than I am listen listen listen you know Uncle Jason talking about you
[02:10:34.700 --> 02:10:38.380]   know now being such a great guy and all that kind of stuff sometimes and trying to be better
[02:10:38.380 --> 02:10:42.820]   you know I I met Jason a long time ago and I met him at a couple of events and never really
[02:10:42.820 --> 02:10:47.980]   talked to him just in passing hello whatever you know I'm down here he's up here and one
[02:10:47.980 --> 02:10:51.220]   day I go and get on a flight and they're like oh he want to upgrade the first class
[02:10:51.220 --> 02:10:56.000]   it's 25 bucks I said sure I sit down Jesus is done next to me and he's like oh doctor
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:00.980]   I'm like oh Jason remembers my name like hey what's up that's 20 minutes he tweets out my
[02:11:00.980 --> 02:11:05.580]   website he shuts my website down yeah he says he says I was like I see these interviews
[02:11:05.580 --> 02:11:09.460]   and people I come by the studio sometime and sure enough he answered my email I came by
[02:11:09.460 --> 02:11:12.660]   the studio have my little crappy equipment he's like don't worry about our videotape
[02:11:12.660 --> 02:11:16.460]   everything I format I said over to you had a nice I've known the guy let me get stuck
[02:11:16.460 --> 02:11:21.140]   in his Tesla and I've seen him once or twice before after but well you know in my mind I
[02:11:21.140 --> 02:11:25.980]   defend Jason all the time because when people say oh Jesus this and that I'm like you don't
[02:11:25.980 --> 02:11:30.440]   know him you see someone on the internet and you think that you know somebody and maybe
[02:11:30.440 --> 02:11:35.040]   had a problem with this person or this person like him you don't know him and again for somebody
[02:11:35.040 --> 02:11:39.560]   like me I'm not important quote unquote I'm not special he took the time out to talk
[02:11:39.560 --> 02:11:43.960]   to me and I'm a regular dude so you don't know somebody until you get to know them and
[02:11:43.960 --> 02:11:48.160]   just being online and reading a tweet does not make you an official I don't want anybody
[02:11:48.160 --> 02:11:52.120]   so I've always loved you Uncle Jason because I love you I love you I love you I'm a hard
[02:11:52.120 --> 02:11:59.020]   headed person Uncle Leo's hard headed when family come together we break it is the deepest
[02:11:59.020 --> 02:12:03.940]   panel we have ever had you guys are just full of heart that's great
