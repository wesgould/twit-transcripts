[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600]   It's time for Twet this week in Tech.
[00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.440]   Oh, I love this panel.
[00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.480]   Amy Webb is back, author of the Genesis Machine,
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.640]   our quest to rewrite life in the age of synthetic biology.
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.200]   Also found her the future today,
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.240]   Institute and our favorite futurist.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.680]   She joins Connie Guillenma,
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.360]   who is also very important in our lives.
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.120]   Editor-in-Chief at CNET and dear friend Dwight Silverman.
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.600]   This is gonna be a great panel from the Houston Chronicle.
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.520]   Yes, we have to talk about Elon.
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.920]   He says, I'm not buying that Twitter thing.
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.800]   What went on? What went down?
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.320]   And what is the future for Twitter?
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.680]   Also two big data laws passed in Europe.
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.680]   What does it mean for all of these big tech companies in the US?
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.760]   And the hacker who stole one billion records
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.760]   of Chinese citizens.
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.160]   Is that story true?
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.400]   Amy has some thoughts. It's all coming up next on Twet.

[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.000]   with wonderful people, excellent journalists,

[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.680]   Amy, Amy Webb is here,
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.240]   always exciting to get her on CEO of Future Today Institute
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.920]   and a futurist.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:05.760]   Hi, Amy.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.280]   - Hey, Leo, how are ya?
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.280]   - I'm great. Welcome back.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.120]   You were an Amsterdam.
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.960]   Have fun.
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.840]   - I was an Amsterdam in Italy.
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.420]   And then before that,
[00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.960]   Aspen and San Francisco, I've been gone for weeks.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.560]   - Oh, were you at the Allen & Company Shindig?
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.720]   - Not that as Sun Valley.
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.680]   I was at the Aspen Ideas Festival
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.600]   and then at a World Economic Forum meeting.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.400]   - Actually, probably much more interesting than Allen & Co.
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.160]   - Yeah, you know, I just don't look good in a puffy vest.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.080]   I feel like I wouldn't fit in to the Allen & Company.
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.160]   - I've, you know, I just, I just,
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.320]   I watch the press looking through the chain-link fence
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.560]   as they arrive in their escalades in their puffy vests.
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.520]   And I think, oh, it just doesn't look
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.840]   like much fun.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:49.680]   So we're--
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.440]   - Did you watch the show's succession training chance?
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.680]   - I love-- - It was pretty funny.
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.160]   - They're parroting. Yeah.
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.000]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.760]   - And they were all in puffy vests actually.
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:59.600]   That was pretty funny.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.600]   - Yeah, they were, there's a whole scene
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.960]   where they sort of make fun of the vest.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.840]   - Yeah, and the name tags and the billionaires don't want
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:05.680]   to wear the name tags,
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.840]   but you gotta wear the name tags.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.680]   - Right.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.880]   - Oh, I love succession.
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.520]   I love, you know what I realize?
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.520]   I have a strange fetish for watching billionaires in action.
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.360]   And actually this show is gonna play right into this,
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.840]   but first let's introduce the rest of the panel.
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.240]   Connie Guilliamo is here.
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.320]   She is editor in chief of CNET, the big boss.
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.800]   Hi Connie.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.640]   - Hello.
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.480]   - Great to have you.
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.320]   - I'm sorry.
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.160]   - Happy Sunday.
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.000]   I appreciate you being here on a Sunday.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.040]   I know this is a difficult time to do a show,
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:34.680]   but we really appreciate it.
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.880]   Also, all the way from Houston,
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.120]   our good friend Dwight Silverman,
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.600]   who's been on Twitch for decades, it seems.
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.240]   - It has been decades, I think.
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.080]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.920]   - Thank you.
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:50.840]   - His newsletter site is authory.com/dsilverman,
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.000]   A-U-T-H-O-R-Y.com.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.200]   How's that going?
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.400]   - It's doing very well.
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.840]   It's a great, it's a service that you pay for
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.720]   and they, you essentially can post everything
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.960]   you've ever written from any source.
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:05.800]   I like that.
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.640]   It displays it nice.
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.480]   Oh, it's great.
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.600]   - So all your chronicle columns and stuff were there?
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.040]   - Yes, and when, for the brief stand,
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.960]   I was at Forbes is there and that's great.
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:15.800]   It's great.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.600]   And this today, my column moved over,
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.880]   my print column moved over to the Sunday,
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.880]   Houston Chronicle, which is good, it publishes on Friday.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:27.440]   So I'm happy to kind of be back home
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.800]   in the technology part of the Houston Chronicle.
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.520]   - You keep trying to retire.
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.800]   (laughing)
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.040]   - You know, it's not happening.
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.040]   - It's like, I don't feel, I don't feel retired.
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:42.240]   Although, this is funny, I'm taking a social media break
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.000]   for a month, not on Facebook or Instagram.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.640]   The only thing I'm doing is, when I have a new column,
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.320]   I post it there and it's really weird
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.840]   'cause I've been doing social media nonstop
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.680]   since it started and really before social media
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.640]   started with BBSs and blogs and I've never stopped
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.280]   and I'm not doing it this month and it's really weird.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.760]   - Getting, going through a social media withdrawal is
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.640]   tough, but everybody I know who's done it,
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.560]   feels like they got a new life.
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.240]   Like suddenly the birds are singing,
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:20.040]   the sun is shining, the world is good.
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:24.080]   - Yes, well, it's that you can't, in July, in Houston,
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.080]   you can't really go outside for very long.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.800]   It's 102 right now and in Austin, it's 108.
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.480]   And, but you know what I found,
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.680]   the thing that has frustrated me most about it
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:40.360]   is that I really miss like when I find a really good story,
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.640]   just sharing it on Twitter or on Facebook
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.200]   and not necessarily commenting on it,
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.320]   but not just being able to find something, say,
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.320]   "Hey, look at this."
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.880]   And that's the thing I miss the most,
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.240]   is kind of sharing stuff.
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:55.400]   But I'll be back probably in early August.
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.840]   - Like the Terminator, he will be back.
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:58.960]   - Sorry, I'll be back.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.080]   - So, you know where I'm gonna start here.
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.240]   I have to, I don't want to, but I have to.
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.560]   Elon Musk says, "I am not buying Twitter."
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:11.760]   Oh my God.
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:12.760]   (laughs)
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.320]   Oh my God.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.000]   To which Twitter responds in the form of
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.360]   Chairman of the Board, Brett Taylor.
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.760]   The Twitter Board is committed to closing the transaction
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.920]   on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr. Musk
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.520]   and plans to pursue legal action
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.160]   to enforce the merger agreement.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.280]   We will, we are confident.
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:35.160]   We will prevail in the Delaware Court of Chancery.
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.720]   Which is a little medieval, but,
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:41.240]   now, @evwilliams, one of the founders of Twitter tweeted,
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.240]   "Oh, come on, Brett.
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.040]   I know you feel like you have to say that,
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.200]   but can't we just let this all go?"
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:53.160]   Amy, it seems to me, and I've seen some other people say this,
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:57.800]   that is a kind of one billionaire to another statement,
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:00.560]   sort of, like, "Oh, don't worry about the little people
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.600]   whose stock price has been depressed by these shenanigans.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.640]   Let's just let Elon off the hook."
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:11.560]   Right, so I will remind everybody,
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.880]   people who have listened to me before know this,
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.840]   but for those of you who I haven't met yet,
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:19.240]   I dropped out of law school right before starting,
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.160]   so I'm not a lawyer.
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.560]   (laughs)
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:25.320]   But I was qualified to go into law school,
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:26.880]   but you didn't actually go to law school,
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:27.720]   so that's like--
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.160]   I made a last-minute decision, not to go.
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:30.640]   Smart woman.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:34.040]   Anyways, so here's my two cents on what's happening.
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:38.440]   There is absolutely a lawsuit,
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:41.600]   and that is because you can't jack around another,
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.840]   if you're gonna kill a company, you have to kill it dead.
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:46.280]   Yes, that's what they say.
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.360]   If you're gonna kill the king, you better not miss.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.840]   Right, so this is not a mostly dead,
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.360]   Princess Bride situation,
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.240]   and there are repercussions.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.000]   This is a publicly traded company,
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.160]   board members have fiduciary responsibility,
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.240]   the leadership of that company has a responsibility
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.160]   to ensure holders and its employees,
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:10.520]   and if an outsider comes in and files paperwork,
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.000]   which he had to do,
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.200]   saying that there was a good faith intent to buy,
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.360]   that is legal paperwork,
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.720]   and to re-nig on that at this point,
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:26.120]   there should and will be repercussions without a doubt.
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.760]   Yeah.
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.920]   I also just say that let's just call it for what it is.
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.040]   Elon Musk likes the drama.
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:35.880]   He's a troll.
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:36.720]   This is happening.
[00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:38.240]   He's a troll.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:40.760]   All of this is happening around the same time
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.240]   that it's come to light that he's got twins.
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.240]   Oh yeah, that's a good one.
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.280]   With one of his employees.
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:49.720]   So like, and then got into a crazy,
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:54.720]   ridiculous argument on Twitter with somebody about,
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.560]   oh, it was Nick Cannon.
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:10:00.480]   The two of them are broing out about underpopulation
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.320]   on the planet,
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.080]   and that's why they're spreading their seeds generously.
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.360]   Thank you, Elon.
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:07.600]   Thank you for blessing us with your progeny.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.600]   US birth rates.
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.760]   There is something,
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.800]   this was part of the,
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:17.120]   what's this face?
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.800]   The Horp Epstein.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:23.640]   There seems to be a common thread among men of a certain.
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.480]   Yes.
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.960]   That there's this like compulsive need to spread their seed.
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:28.800]   Yeah.
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:32.280]   And part of the justification for that is underpopulation.
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.160]   This is a crazy ego-driven.
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:36.680]   Can I tell you what the real,
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:38.520]   what's really the subtext of this,
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.840]   and it's kind of like replacement theory,
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:44.200]   that the dumb people are reproducing at a fast rate.
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:48.800]   So we who are smarter than them must keep up.
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.200]   Otherwise, all that's left is dumb people.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.320]   And so it comes, I guarantee you,
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.640]   because I know people like you.
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:55.480]   Yeah, no, no, no, I think you're.
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.440]   It comes from this point,
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:00.280]   this sense that I am a superior race.
[00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:05.040]   And so it is my obligation to spread my seed far and wide.
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.840]   So I had nothing to do with a fertility slump.
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.080]   I guarantee you it hasn't been.
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.760]   Yeah, but I mean, that's what they're saying.
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.600]   It's crypto-racist is what it is.
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:16.640]   Crypto, you know, rich purpose in this.
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:17.720]   Crypto classes.
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.880]   Classes, there's the word.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:19.880]   There's a word.
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:20.880]   Yeah.
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.640]   It's just a certain amount of hubris here.
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.640]   Hubris, yeah.
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:24.640]   And going back to the-
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:25.640]   All the iss.
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:30.840]   But there is a legal responsibility that as a signer,
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.080]   he now bears.
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:36.480]   And there are, you know, the folks who are suing on behalf
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.280]   of shareholders and investors and just like company chaos
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.640]   are absolutely within their rights
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:41.960]   and are probably going to prevail.
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:42.960]   Yeah.
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.800]   In court, if it's not settled outside.
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:45.800]   Connie, go ahead.
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:49.160]   And I was going to say, there's a billion dollar break-up fee
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:50.560]   at stake here as well.
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:54.680]   And I think, I don't know what others feel, but the beginning
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.960]   of this whole Elon Musk wants to buy Twitter.
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:01.640]   If you were taking odds from folks who follow Elon Musk, we all knew
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.640]   that that deal wasn't going to go through.
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:07.240]   Especially when the stock prices for Tesla took a hit
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.440]   and his wealth was affected.
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:12.680]   And, you know, you can say whatever you want about what you want
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.560]   to do and what your feelings about it are.
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:17.120]   But at the end of the day, to Amy's point, you have to put down
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:20.240]   some legal commitments and you have to put down some money.
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:24.840]   And then if you feel that you want to jerk around the SEC,
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.000]   which is what some people thought Musk was doing
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.520]   and jerk around Twitter, that's all well and good in Twitter.
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:32.440]   And it plays to the drama and you like to be part of the drama.
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:35.840]   But there is shareholder accountability and there's money.
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:39.840]   There's a billion dollar break-up fee at stake that Elon Musk,
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:41.360]   you know, doesn't want to pay.
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.480]   So that's, you know, it's all about money at this point.
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:45.400]   Twitter's not--
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.280]   Twitter's saying not-- it's not a billion.
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:48.520]   We want 44 billion.
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:52.000]   You said you were going to give us 44 billion and by God, you will.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.560]   Although, you know, these things take time.
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:55.400]   It's got to go to court.
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.800]   There will be lawsuits back and forth.
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.480]   The Delaware Court of Chancery does move a little bit faster,
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:05.160]   apparently, in issues like this to protect, in particular,
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:08.160]   the corporations registered there like Twitter.
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.320]   So I suspect there may be an outcome quickly.
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:15.280]   But there's been a lot of interesting speculation,
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:18.000]   especially about this billion dollar breakup fee.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.080]   He could make a lot more than the billion dollar breakup
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:26.800]   fee just by a pump and dump scam on Twitter.
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.440]   He bought-- remember, he bought 9.25% of Twitter's stock
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:34.840]   without revealing it, breaking SEC regulations at the time.
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.480]   Still no punishment on that, although they're investigating.
[00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:42.360]   And then announced, even after he bought 9.25% at a reduced
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:46.520]   amount, then announced he was going to buy it, thinking perhaps
[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.320]   the stock price now would go straight up.
[00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:52.000]   And he could sell all that stock, did not happen.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.840]   In fact, you're not alone, Connie.
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:57.560]   Not only did pundits not believe he meant to buy it,
[00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:00.920]   the market didn't, because at no time did Twitter's stock price
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:03.480]   go anywhere near what Elon was offering.
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.200]   In fact, right now, it's $36.
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.760]   Elon's offering $54.20.
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:11.400]   That's exactly the market saying, yeah, no, that's not going
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.160]   to happen.
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.720]   Otherwise, the price would go close to $54.20, wouldn't it?
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:16.840]   You're absolutely right.
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:18.040]   Yeah, nobody believed it.
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:19.480]   Nobody believed it.
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:24.920]   And so we're just left with the mess, basically.
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:28.080]   I mean, I know people who work at Twitter.
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.520]   I feel so bad for Twitter.
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.000]   Twitter has been struggling trying
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.120]   to expand its membership.
[00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:35.040]   They have their challenges and issues.
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:39.840]   You really don't need a boy billionaire with an ego
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:43.080]   about what he wants to say, screwing things up.
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.000]   And so now it is put up or set up time.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.440]   Will he ultimately buy Twitter?
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.480]   Obviously, that's not going to happen.
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.640]   So it's really a question of how much
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.520]   does he have to pay for screwing around with a publicly
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:55.200]   traded company?
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:59.680]   And also, remember, he's been in trouble with SVC many times.
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.480]   He's done this to Tesla shareholders,
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:04.440]   right, saying that he would take a buyout bid,
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.200]   and then the SEC slapped him with a fine.
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.320]   And then all of his tweets had to be reviewed by the SEC.
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:14.240]   So he's had a lot of pent up anger at the beginning
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:15.680]   when this was all announced.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:19.000]   People thought he was just trolling the SEC somewhat.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.520]   So--
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:22.520]   I have a question, because Brian and I--
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:24.560]   my husband and I had an argument about this whole thing
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:25.280]   over the weekend.
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:28.600]   Wow, you guys are really interesting.
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:29.600]   I know, right?
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.920]   Lisa and I are arguing about what color the paint should be
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:33.680]   on the house.
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:35.160]   And you're arguing about Elon.
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:35.680]   That's good.
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:36.320]   I like it.
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:36.680]   I like it.
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.160]   We had a knockdown drag at Arguin about this.
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.760]   And he is an Elon apologist.
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:42.560]   No matter what--
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:43.240]   See, there are those--
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.120]   I'm asking questions.
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.760]   He's a stand.
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:46.720]   He's a stand.
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:47.680]   He's a total stand.
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.840]   And no matter what I said, it was--
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.000]   but he disrupted the auto industry.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.200]   And without him, there wouldn't be electric cars.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.800]   And he disrupted-- look at--
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.560]   he disrupted space.
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:04.000]   And it was like no measure of just practical facts applied.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.440]   And then I said, well, let's think about this
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:10.440]   in terms of Jeff Bezos, who gets no passes.
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.000]   Everybody-- there's nobody to defend Bezos.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.760]   And I would argue that Bezos has actually
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:19.640]   been more influential in changing global economic structures
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.640]   among other things.
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:25.520]   And every-- like Bezos makes mistakes.
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:28.160]   He has no slack.
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.320]   Elon keeps doing ridiculous things.
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:34.320]   And there's just legions of people ready to defend him,
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.080]   including my husband.
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:38.000]   And I can't grok.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.800]   Why?
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:40.960]   Maybe it's because I'm a woman.
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:41.800]   I don't know.
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:44.160]   There is no way for me to get into the headspace where
[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:49.080]   I see the net positives that this guy is wielding at this point.
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.800]   It's the state of the world today, isn't it?
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:54.480]   That half the world goes, what's the deal?
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.520]   Why do you like this guy?
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:58.360]   And the other half says, he's God.
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.120]   And it's just not-- not just Elon, I might add.
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:03.040]   There's other people with orange or hair.
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:07.880]   And it's like those of us who are in the skeptic camp,
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:09.880]   just I don't understand it.
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.040]   I don't get it.
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:17.560]   Elon has kind of-- in the past has relied on his instincts
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:21.240]   as to what needs to be done and has had successes with it.
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.800]   SpaceX is a success.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:26.200]   He has disrupted space, electric cars.
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.040]   That's a success.
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:30.520]   And all of them were the result of him going, you know,
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.120]   I think this is the way it should be done,
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:35.400]   and I have the resource to do it, and we're going to push for it.
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:39.600]   But that's kind of the same thing he did with Twitter.
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:43.080]   His experience on Twitter is not what your experience
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:45.080]   and my experience is on Twitter.
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:48.520]   It's one of the reasons why he's so obsessed with spam bots.
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:51.480]   You know, we occasionally see spam bots on Twitter,
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:53.280]   and we block them and move on.
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:55.680]   But he's got millions and millions of followers,
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:58.120]   and it's a completely different universe for him,
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.760]   and he's obsessed with them.
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.760]   So his-- what he had-- what he did with SpaceX
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:07.600]   and what he did with Tesla, he was trying to do the same thing.
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:10.480]   It was his instinct, I'm going to buy this company.
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:16.280]   I'm going to make it the open-ended town hall for the world,
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:20.080]   which was actually one of the things that Twitter talked about
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.880]   and some of its founders talked about,
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.800]   the pulse of the planet early on.
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:24.920]   And he says, I'm going to do that.
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:27.000]   I'm going to save this.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:32.640]   But when it turned out to not be what as easy as he thought it was,
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.920]   and it's a completely different beast,
[00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:39.360]   and I like what Matt Levine said in his Bloomberg piece
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:44.000]   that he started it out kind of tongue-in-cheek, believed in it,
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.800]   but got bored, and now he's walked away from it.
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:51.680]   I think the same instinct that brought him to Tesla and SpaceX
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:54.760]   brought him to Twitter, but it failed him.
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.880]   And I should point out, and you might want to give Brian
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:59.040]   the book "Ludacris" by Edward Niedermeyer,
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:02.000]   which is about Elon Musk and Tesla.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.920]   Niedermeyer had an opinion piece in the New York Times early in June.
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:10.040]   When Elon Musk dreams his employees have nightmares,
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:13.680]   he interviewed 100 Tesla employees to do the book,
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:19.680]   and really points out that as much as Elon took credit for SpaceX
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:25.320]   and took credit for Tesla, he was a pain in the butt for the employees.
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:28.640]   Mr. Musk reported that he had slept in--
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.720]   this is Niedermeyer writing-- slept in Tesla's factories
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.760]   during this period, which he called production hell.
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:36.440]   What he left out of his self-aggrandizing
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:38.440]   was the reality for his employees.
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:42.280]   His presence brought no real manufacturing expertise to bear,
[00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:47.320]   just the overbearing pressure of a boss whose public shaming was punctuated
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:50.920]   by declarations like, quote, "I could be on my own private island
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:55.760]   when they could supermodels drinking my ties, but I'm not."
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.840]   And I have to say, you know, you hear the same stories about Elon
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:05.560]   sitting in an all-night sessions discussing the nozzles on SpaceX, Falcon Heavy,
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:10.520]   but he's not a space engineer, and I'm sure his presence at those meetings
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:13.200]   was more of a burden than it was an asset.
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:15.120]   His money is welcome.
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:18.920]   Let me put in a sort of supportive plug for an outside
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:22.960]   and perspective on things, because, you know, most of the time,
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:27.800]   I am in boardrooms with executives or their C-suites.
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:32.000]   And even very successful companies become very myopic over time.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.120]   So it can be useful to have even a senior executive
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:40.160]   who's just an incredible leader, who doesn't have domain expertise
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:45.880]   in that industry lead because you get a valuable outside and perspective.
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:48.440]   But I think there's a maturity issue here.
[00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:52.400]   And there's a vast difference between an outside and perspective
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:55.520]   where you may lack domain expertise, but you're an incredible executive.
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:58.160]   You're just an incredible chief executive.
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:03.400]   And what we're witnessing, which is just like, you know,
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:07.240]   billionaire boy, immaturity, hubris stuff.
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:12.160]   And, you know, I don't think we should be celebrating somebody
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:16.240]   who got a hair up their end and decided they'd, you know,
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:21.440]   take over a company and then, like, change their mind.
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:24.760]   And in the process, you know, created all kinds of chaos
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:27.720]   in the wake of that that's very un-American.
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:31.720]   If you think about the structures that hold up our economic functions
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:35.160]   in our society, like, we should not be celebrating that.
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:37.960]   I just watched two great TV shows.
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:41.400]   One about Adam Newman, a we were called We Crashed on Apple TV.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.520]   Yeah, super good.
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:45.160]   And then The Dropout, which is all about Elizabeth Holmes
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.760]   and the failure of Theranos.
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:50.520]   And both of them shared the same, and I suspect Elon,
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:54.600]   and both of them probably looking back to Steve Jobs,
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:58.280]   who did turn this kind of out-of-the-box thinking
[00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:02.840]   and driving personality into a real success at Apple.
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:07.480]   And I think there is this kind of culture in Silicon Valley
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:12.520]   that the unruly CEO is an advantage, not at this advantage,
[00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:14.760]   just as you said, Amy.
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:16.600]   But there's a line.
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:19.240]   Steve Jobs kind of stuck to his knitting.
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:23.320]   Although, I remember when they were making the Fremont factory
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:26.360]   for the Macintosh, he insisted all the machines be painted
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:29.240]   in a particular shade of what was it read.
[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:32.120]   He really liked that color.
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:35.400]   Elon, this is an article from three years ago in The Intelligence,
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.560]   or Tesla factory workers are in danger,
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:40.280]   because Elon Musk hates the color yellow.
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:42.200]   He refused.
[00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:46.120]   He had kind of gray lines on the assembly line
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:48.040]   that were hard to see instead of the traditional,
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:51.080]   you know, yellow stripes, caution stripes,
[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:54.040]   because he doesn't like the color yellow.
[00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:56.680]   Lane lines in the factory floor are painted in shades
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.440]   of gray and Tesla denies it.
[00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:01.240]   He also is into not having too many signs,
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:03.720]   and doesn't like the beeping sounds forklifts make
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.160]   when they go in reverse.
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:07.080]   And as a result, it's very dangerous,
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:08.360]   according to The Intelligence,
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:11.240]   or it was very dangerous to work in the Tesla factory.
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:12.040]   I shouldn't laugh.
[00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:15.000]   Well, I want to go back to what Amy just said
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.240]   about why people admire,
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:20.440]   why they admire personalities.
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:21.960]   And that's really what it's about, right?
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:24.840]   We live in a society now with a cult of personality,
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:28.280]   and people are entertained by someone who's different
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:33.240]   and outrageous and, you know, we'll say crazy things, right?
[00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:33.800]   Yeah.
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:35.640]   Some people definitely love it,
[00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:38.280]   but there's a difference between being a celebrity
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:40.600]   and being a business leader who has,
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:44.840]   you know, thousands of employees' lives and livelihoods,
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:46.760]   you know, under his thumb, you know,
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:50.360]   or under his color choices, if you will.
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:52.520]   And being somebody who's a visionary.
[00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:55.720]   So we can say that Elon Musk had a definite vision
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.480]   about space and about electric cars
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:00.200]   and was able to follow through, not easily, right?
[00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:03.560]   Tesla was in this lamb-done success
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:05.720]   that people, you know, thought it would be.
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.320]   And so he had to invest,
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:10.680]   and he had to see through some of that vision,
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:14.440]   but not all of his, I wouldn't call him the most business savvy,
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:16.920]   certainly not the most ethical business leader,
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:18.760]   or even the most forward-thinking one,
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:21.080]   when I just saw that he wants to cut,
[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:23.640]   or he's in the process of cutting a lot of his staff,
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.880]   and he's asked everyone, you know, post,
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.440]   or mid-pandemic or post-pandemic,
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:29.240]   wherever you think we are,
[00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:32.600]   to go back to work five days a week or turn in your batch.
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:33.800]   Insisted, they come back.
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:36.680]   So there's a difference between what a personality
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.120]   is from an entertainment value,
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:41.480]   and we definitely see that with him and others
[00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.480]   in the political realm and outside of it.
[00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:46.520]   And then there's the, okay, let's talk real now.
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:48.440]   And there is no real talk.
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.760]   When you get to that point about,
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:52.520]   what are you doing that makes sense?
[00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:53.480]   Why is it sensible?
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:54.680]   Why should we follow you?
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:57.320]   Why should you get a pass?
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:57.960]   Certainly.
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:01.080]   So it's just we live in a world where people,
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:02.920]   and maybe your husband is one of them,
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:05.160]   just wants to put his blinders on about,
[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.840]   well, he did these good things.
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:09.000]   And you know, it's like, you know,
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:10.680]   somebody who's convicted of a crime,
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:12.120]   the neighbor's, oh, but he was so nice.
[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:13.480]   He was such a nice, quiet person.
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:18.120]   I think that the point that you're making about personality
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.120]   is absolutely on.
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:22.200]   And I think a facet of that is,
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:27.240]   speaking up in a way that some people feel like they can't,
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:30.920]   being able to jostle the status quo in a way
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:32.520]   that people feel like they can't.
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:36.200]   I mean, people compare him to Tony Stark.
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:38.840]   And I think that there's a certain amount of reverence
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:43.720]   for Tony Stark, you know, for not having any superpowers,
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:47.000]   but through the sheer might of his own ideas,
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:50.760]   and the will to carry through, you know,
[00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:53.160]   that he's sort of challenged.
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:53.560]   - Iron man is not real.
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:56.040]   - No, but I can.
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:56.520]   - What?
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:26:00.120]   - I'll tell you who I don't hear defending Musk.
[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:01.240]   I never hear,
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:03.160]   or let me put it this way.
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.760]   The group that tends to defend him
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:06.920]   tends to be pretty homogenous, right?
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:08.120]   It is white men.
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:08.680]   - Tech bros.
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:13.240]   - I don't, well, so, but that's, my husband's not a tech bro,
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:15.080]   but he's a white man.
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:19.000]   And I just, when I hear him talk about it,
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.240]   it sounds like it's almost a yearning for,
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:25.240]   it's a character, it's a character, a personality
[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:27.240]   that I think people looked up,
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:28.280]   up to you because they're doing things
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:29.800]   that people feel like they can't on their own.
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:31.480]   - It's the great man, I agree with you,
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:34.760]   and that's why Trump, of course, has his adherence.
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.600]   It's the great man hypothesis too,
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:37.720]   which we really believe,
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:40.920]   which is that Napoleon, or Alexander the Great,
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.160]   or Thomas Edison, or Henry Ford,
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:45.080]   these great men stand up above
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:48.600]   the crowd to lead us into the future,
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.720]   and it's through their force of personality
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:53.720]   that they are able to do great things
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.960]   that the rest of us can only admire.
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.960]   - Right, and it's hard during it.
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:58.440]   - It's pretty much debunked.
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:00.120]   - Doesn't it, the great man hypothesis?
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:03.560]   - I mean, yes, but the problem is the paradox
[00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:06.520]   of the present, it's very hard to decouple
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:09.640]   the attraction that you feel for that personality
[00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:12.840]   at that moment, and then sort of, you know what,
[00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:14.840]   so Jack Welsh, if you think back to
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:18.120]   GE and Jack Welsh and his disciples,
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:20.120]   in that moment, he was hated.
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:21.720]   And there's some similarities here.
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:24.920]   He was driving stock prices way up.
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:28.040]   Yeah, total cult, and in the aftermath of all of that,
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:30.920]   you know, he's been vilified, like not a good guy,
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:33.720]   you know, and encouraging entire commission.
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:37.560]   - There's a book about him called The Man Who Broke Capitalism.
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:41.160]   - It's by David Gels, it's a terrific, terrific book.
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.280]   You should read it if you have it.
[00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:43.320]   (laughing)
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.640]   - And unfortunately, capitalism has survived.
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:51.160]   But yeah, and actually, Welsh got a $417 million
[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:54.520]   severance package from GE, so.
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:57.560]   - Right, but the problem is, during the time,
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:59.880]   everybody was like, "Oh, this guy could do no wrong."
[00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:00.360]   - Yeah.
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:01.400]   - You know, no apologizing.
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:02.440]   - Oh, there are all these books.
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:04.440]   - Horrible, horrible, terrible behavior.
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:09.880]   But, you know, with some distance, we see things differently.
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:16.440]   And I think in time, we will, it happens all the time, right,
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:18.760]   to every character throughout history.
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:21.240]   - Well, isn't that part of that cult of personality,
[00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:23.720]   though? We love to build them up and knock them down.
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:26.760]   Sometimes they knock themselves down.
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:27.560]   - Well.
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:28.200]   - Which is what they give us.
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.560]   - They give us the ammunition often, yeah.
[00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:30.280]   - Right.
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:35.480]   I have a question about the billion dollar termination.
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.040]   - Yeah.
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:36.680]   - Yeah.
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.600]   And, you know, Connie talked about this,
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:39.800]   but I'm curious about this.
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:44.200]   Why would Twitter make the statement, you know,
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:46.760]   basically Elon says, "I'm dropping the deal,"
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:50.120]   and Twitter says, "No, you aren't. We'll see you in court."
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:53.320]   Why not just say, "All right, give us the billion dollars
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:56.040]   and go away and let us go about our business."
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:58.920]   Why do the...
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:01.400]   - I mean, it's probably going to end up with a settlement.
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:02.440]   - I'll tell you why.
[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:03.800]   $36.81.
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:07.480]   That's the Twitter stock price after this mess.
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:12.680]   And it's directly due to Elon Musk,
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:14.120]   and Twitter wants to be made whole.
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.800]   A billion dollars ain't going to make it whole.
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:19.080]   Connie, you're not, I agree.
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:19.400]   - Yeah.
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:20.600]   I was also going to say,
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:22.520]   I think that's just all legal chatter too.
[00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:24.600]   They have to show that they have a good faith effort
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:26.040]   to want to continue the deal,
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.760]   and they believe that he is not acted in good faith
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:30.280]   by walking away from the deal,
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:32.120]   complaining about bots and so forth.
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:33.880]   And so I think that's just legal,
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:34.360]   maneuvering.
[00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:35.560]   I'm not a lawyer either.
[00:29:35.560 --> 00:29:37.080]   I did apply to law school as well,
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:38.360]   and decided to be a journalist.
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:39.880]   So I have that comment with you, Amy.
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:42.200]   But from what I understand,
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:43.720]   is that you have to...
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:46.520]   This is all about good faith efforts, right?
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:49.400]   So there's a good faith effort to close the deal.
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:50.920]   That's what Twitter is doing now.
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:52.280]   They're insisting you're right.
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:55.960]   The billion dollar doesn't cover the harm that they've felt,
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:59.240]   but also Elon Musk doesn't want to pay even the billion dollars.
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:29:59.560]   - No.
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:01.720]   - This is why he's turning it into the agreement.
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:05.000]   - Interestingly though, Connie, his public...
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.240]   And by the way, I always have to remind myself,
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:11.240]   it's legal to lie to the press, to the public on Twitter.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:14.680]   His public stance is there's more than 5% of bots.
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:17.640]   That's unacceptable.
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:19.560]   In the letter from his lawyers,
[00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:21.080]   and I'm going to say the name because I love saying,
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:23.240]   it's Skadden, Arp, Slate, Meagre, and Flom.
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:28.280]   In the letter from his lawyers,
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:31.240]   did I mention they're Skadden, Arp, Slate, Meagre, and Flom?
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:33.480]   They didn't mention the spam bots.
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:35.960]   They just said, "Twitter has been non-cooperative,
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:40.120]   "and has not given us the information we've asked for
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:42.520]   "in order to assess this problem."
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:46.120]   They are in fact not giving any evidence that it's not 5%.
[00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:47.800]   They're not saying it's more than 5%.
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:49.720]   They're just saying, "Twitter's not being cooperative."
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:51.160]   That's a different grounds.
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:53.640]   And by the way, at grounds, I don't think he's going to win on,
[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:57.720]   because remember, this deal was as is.
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:01.880]   He waived the right to all the due diligence
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:04.280]   that would normally accompany this kind of merger.
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:05.000]   He waived it.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.040]   And Twitter, I think, has been,
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:11.080]   and I think a judge will say, has been performative.
[00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:12.840]   They gave him the firehose.
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:14.280]   They gave him every single tweet,
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:15.320]   half a billion tweets a day.
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:18.040]   What more could you give him
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:20.760]   than every bit of traffic on Twitter?
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:23.720]   I think they have been cooperative.
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:25.560]   So I think he's not going to prevail.
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:26.680]   This is going to be a problem.
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:35.320]   I mentioned the Matt Levine article called "Elon's Out" on Bloomberg.
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:39.160]   And in it, he puts a lot of that into context
[00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:41.720]   and talks about three different scenarios
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:43.640]   as to what he thinks is going on,
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.480]   and incorporates a lot of that letter.
[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:48.040]   - The Veen is great. - The Veen is really good.
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:51.480]   I trust his, you know, he's a best-bit banker.
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:52.920]   He had the M&A.
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:54.600]   He knows this stuff.
[00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:58.760]   And his, you know, of the three scenarios,
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:03.400]   he basically thinks that Elon did this as a joke,
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:04.680]   that it basically--
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:05.640]   - He got swept away. - He got swept away.
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:07.960]   - And he got swept away in it.
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:12.360]   And I bet, I bet you anything that there will be
[00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:15.240]   a very short period of negotiation,
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:16.840]   and they will settle this quickly.
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:19.320]   - It's fascinating.
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:22.200]   Do you think it's possible also that we're underestimating Elon
[00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:25.640]   that he was being smart about this?
[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:26.600]   There's one theory.
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:30.440]   This is from Yahoo Finance, Aaron Prater.
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:34.760]   How Elon's bizarre Twitter takeover saga could just have been a cover
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:38.200]   for him to sell 8.5 billion in Tesla stock.
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:41.800]   Maybe he's sly as a fox.
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.560]   Maybe this was all a clever ruse.
[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:47.960]   Nobody believes that.
[00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:49.960]   (all laughing)
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:51.480]   - I think it's worth us, Zoop.
[00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:52.920]   I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:57.160]   - I was just gonna say, Elon Musk loves drama.
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:58.920]   He loves to be this under drama.
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:00.760]   And I think Dwight's point is correct,
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:02.840]   that he started this as kind of a joke.
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:07.000]   Well, Elon, will you come and save us and save free speech
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.040]   and whatever and buy Twitter?
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:10.120]   And he's like, yes, I will do that for you.
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:10.520]   - Yeah.
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:12.600]   - But then, you know, the rubber hits the road,
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:13.880]   and it's like, wait a minute, like--
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:14.200]   - Yeah.
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:16.200]   - There's money in it. - I think it's--
[00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:16.920]   - That's sick.
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:17.480]   - Yeah.
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:19.720]   - I think it's worth assuming out and asking
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:23.320]   what the next order implications of all of this will be.
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:28.600]   We do some work with government,
[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:32.440]   and I hear often people saying that statesmanship is gone.
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:36.440]   So the way that government and politics is about
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:38.520]   politicking now and less about policy,
[00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:41.080]   the politicking is easier, the policy is hard,
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:43.560]   and you just don't behave the way they used to.
[00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:44.040]   - Yeah.
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:46.360]   - I think there's something analogous to what we're seeing
[00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:48.600]   in the world of, the newer world of business.
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:51.720]   You know, there's disrupting industries
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:55.000]   that have been reluctant to respond to emerging technologies
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.880]   and forces, but then there's also disrupting
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:03.560]   sort of the diplomacy of business or just how,
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:05.560]   you know, how we've operated.
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:07.320]   And another way to look at this is,
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:11.720]   you know, do other people start to have ideas
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:16.280]   about manipulating or influencing how companies operate?
[00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:20.920]   If Elon comes from, you know, let's not forget,
[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:21.800]   there was Dogecoin.
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:25.960]   We've seen patterns before.
[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:30.120]   You know, what if others emerge and start to do the same thing?
[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:34.600]   The chaos that ensues as a result,
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:38.200]   you know, changes the landscape in a way that I don't think is positive.
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:39.480]   I think there's positive disruption,
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:42.440]   and I think there's just like disruptive in a bad way disruption, right?
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:45.720]   - It's not thoughtful, and it doesn't have any future
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:50.680]   thinking. It's really just, what can I do right now
[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:54.680]   to get people's attention, to get people's vote, to get people's money,
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:57.160]   and it has no-- - Right, and Connie--
[00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:59.400]   - Planning. - I think Connie is sort of opening
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:00.840]   Southwell and all of this is right.
[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:03.880]   You know, we're living in this age of sort of high drama all around.
[00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:06.840]   - Yeah. - And that's, you know,
[00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:11.960]   again, like the next order impacts of that aren't purposeful or thoughtful,
[00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:17.320]   and I worry a little bit about the positioning, what's left, right?
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:20.520]   Regardless of the place where it's happening.
[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:26.360]   - Well, I hope to your point that what's left is people who want to disrupt things
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:27.960]   get away with the disruption.
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:32.120]   If sometimes it does have a positive impact and we can change loss and whatever,
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:36.280]   but if you're disrupting things and it doesn't work, you have the SEC,
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:41.400]   which remember forced him to step down as the chairman of a Twitter because of his tweets.
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:45.720]   He paid a $20 million fine, which to him is probably the spare change in his pocket,
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:48.840]   but nonetheless, there are enforcement vehicles.
[00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:55.480]   And so people will push and we allow them to get away with it unless there's a recourse.
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:58.440]   And I mean, this is what the January 6th hearings are all about, right?
[00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:01.080]   You can do-- you can say whatever you want, but at the end of the day,
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:04.440]   do some people go to jail for insurrection or manipulation?
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:11.160]   So will there be repercussions against Musk beyond he might have to negotiate with Twitter
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:14.680]   on a larger or smaller billion dollar breakup fee?
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:23.160]   That's where the change is going to have some impact, but only if the institutions
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:25.720]   are willing to go through the trouble to pursue.
[00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:30.680]   - Well, and that's the grave risk because we're teetering right now.
[00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:36.280]   And if there is no consequence to behavior like this, people will lose faith.
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:37.800]   They'll lose faith in the rule of law.
[00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:43.240]   They'll lose faith in our institutions, in norms, and then all bets are off.
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:47.640]   And by pushing it to the brink to see what's going to happen,
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:50.440]   yeah, I hope there are consequences.
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:53.480]   But if they're not, the consequence is far greater.
[00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:59.240]   And I think there's a serious risk that there will be no consequences for any of this behavior,
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:02.520]   whether it's January 6th, Elon Musk, or anything else.
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:09.960]   And if the SEC feels pretty toothless, and I think Musk thinks he's going to get away with it for sure,
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:12.680]   right? And that's bad.
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:13.880]   - I think accountability.
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:14.520]   - Then you lose faith.
[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:19.800]   Then the American people will lose faith in our institutions, and that's when it's all over.
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:22.840]   Is the SEC toothless or just slow?
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:27.480]   In other words, they did ultimately take action that caused him to-
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:28.760]   - $20 million fine.
[00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:31.000]   - And step down as the chairman.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:36.200]   - And insisting that he have a lawyer look at all his tweets, which is obviously not happening.
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:37.320]   And what is their response?
[00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:39.400]   - I think we better investigate that.
[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:42.600]   They're under-financed, and they're under-manned.
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:43.160]   - They are, yes.
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:43.640]   - Yes.
[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:44.600]   - But-
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:46.360]   - And this is the bigger problem.
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:52.280]   Our institutions are not prepared to handle norm-breakers to this degree.
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:56.440]   We didn't expect anybody like Donald Trump.
[00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.200]   We weren't prepared for that.
[00:37:58.200 --> 00:37:59.560]   We weren't prepared for Elon.
[00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:05.640]   The SEC is not prepared for somebody who doesn't care what you or I or the SEC thinks.
[00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:08.280]   We expect some level of norms.
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:14.360]   And when somebody goes that far, I think like Mark Meadows, we freeze.
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:16.520]   We don't know what we-
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:21.240]   I don't-
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:24.440]   I'm not willing to write off the SEC just yet.
[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:25.080]   I hope not.
[00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:32.520]   I think it will be real interesting in the next few days to see what kind of words come out of there.
[00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:39.560]   You know, there's a lot of criticism right now about Merrick Garland and him not moving fast enough
[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:43.480]   in the DOJ in the January 6 investigations.
[00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:49.160]   And I think that he, like a lot of lawyers, is very careful.
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:53.320]   And you don't mount that case until you know you can win it.
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:58.360]   And I think that the SEC, I want my SEC to be like that.
[00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:01.880]   I want them when they step forward, they've got it.
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:03.720]   That's fine.
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:04.360]   If they're being-
[00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:06.280]   If that's what they're doing.
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:06.760]   Yeah.
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:07.480]   That's fine.
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:10.920]   But they need to give some sign that that's what's coming.
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:12.040]   Well, they don't even need to do that.
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:14.120]   But they need to at some point act.
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:18.760]   Remember, the point of the SEC, the whole reason the SEC exists is so that people have faith
[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:19.880]   in the stock market.
[00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:24.920]   That there is an insider trading going on. That the information you as an individual investor
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:28.840]   are given is the same as everybody else. That it's an equal playing field.
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:32.760]   And as soon as people don't believe that, forget it.
[00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:37.160]   The whole financial system relies upon that trust.
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:40.360]   So the SEC has a very important mandate.
[00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:41.400]   Well, it's a lot-
[00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:43.800]   And I think they need to speak up quickly on this.
[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:44.120]   Yeah.
[00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:46.360]   And let's also look at Musk.
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:49.320]   He made a bid for a company.
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:51.800]   And now all of this drama has ensued.
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:55.080]   And like you said, from the very beginning Leo, the market didn't even believe it.
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:58.520]   If Elon Musk goes to make a bid on another company.
[00:39:58.520 --> 00:40:00.360]   Yeah, he's ruined his reputation.
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:01.400]   What are they going to say?
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:07.560]   I mean, the talk about Musk and bankers and everyone interested in him
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:11.960]   is if he takes SpaceX public, they would like to be part of that deal.
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:16.360]   But I just don't see him knocking on another door and everyone welcoming him in.
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:19.720]   He has damaged Tesla's value as well.
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:26.360]   In fact, it's not completely clear, but a lot of the money he was putting up
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.280]   was borrowed against Tesla stock on margin.
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:33.080]   But Tesla stock price, if it goes below, it's thought somewhere around 7.25.
[00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:34.040]   It's very close right now.
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:35.960]   That margin would be called.
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:39.320]   Would suddenly have to put up all that money.
[00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:43.560]   I mean, you can't say he's not a brave fellow.
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:44.680]   He has put up-
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:45.960]   There are bankers on the lines.
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:46.760]   So this is not-
[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:47.240]   Yeah.
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:51.320]   There's another part of the story, which is the financing on this was not just his.
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:51.880]   He wasn't-
[00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:53.640]   There were a lot of people were in this.
[00:40:53.640 --> 00:40:54.440]   Yes.
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:55.960]   There were banks that were involved.
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:56.520]   Including the sovereign-
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:57.080]   Including the sovereign-
[00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:59.000]   The sovereign fund of Saudi Arabia.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.200]   Right.
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:04.360]   So I have to ask where all of these other stakeholders are
[00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:05.880]   in the middle of this-
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:06.360]   Can you mention the full call?
[00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:10.680]   Walking away and was it his unilateral decision to walk away?
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:17.000]   And if so, how much has that really screwed over all of these other potential future investors for
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.240]   investors for other venture, SpaceX or whatever?
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:23.880]   There are next-order consequences here that I just-
[00:41:23.880 --> 00:41:24.600]   Yeah.
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:26.120]   And what if Twitter?
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:27.400]   What happens now with Twitter?
[00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:29.880]   Let's say, all right, Elon walks away.
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:30.440]   It's over.
[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:33.320]   Twitter's going to just continue on as always.
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:36.760]   By the way, there's also, I think, a fairly credible story
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:38.120]   that this was the plan all along.
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:40.520]   Jack Dorsey, remember, endorsed the Elon acquisition.
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:43.800]   It said that Jack put in Agrowal as the CEO,
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:47.640]   a kind of not the ideal guy to run this challenging company
[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:49.480]   because he knew Musk was going to come along.
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:51.080]   He wanted a weak CEO.
[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:52.840]   The board has no dog in this hunt.
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:55.720]   They have very small amount of Twitter stock.
[00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:57.320]   Jack has the most with only 2%.
[00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:02.840]   There are those conspiracy theory-minded that this was the plan all along.
[00:42:02.840 --> 00:42:06.360]   To, you know, palm it off on Musk.
[00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:08.120]   Now what?
[00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:09.240]   If it fails, now what?
[00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:10.280]   Where are they?
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:10.680]   Twitter.
[00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:15.800]   This, so the business model for this company was never salient.
[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:18.600]   And I'm, listen, I'm in one of the OGs.
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:21.160]   So I've been on it since this service launched.
[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:25.480]   And I loved using it up until probably two years ago,
[00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:28.120]   when I think things are- when things changed.
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:30.840]   The business model never quite worked.
[00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:33.160]   It was never going to make sense for this to be ad supported.
[00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:36.200]   They did some M&A activity, but then, you know,
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:38.200]   when they acquired Nussel, for example,
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:40.120]   and rather than monetizing that,
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:41.320]   which they should have done,
[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:42.840]   because it was a terrific,
[00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:45.080]   it could have been a terrific product to work alongside it.
[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:48.440]   They killed it, integrated some of it, and made it worse.
[00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:53.560]   So, you know, the amount- the price was already inflated.
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:56.360]   I think the stock price was already inflated.
[00:42:56.360 --> 00:43:01.080]   And what was the- Twitter has a fraction of the number of MOUs
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:03.480]   compared to others in its category.
[00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:05.960]   So, you know, there's that.
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:10.040]   Apparently, Eline has pointed it down the puffy jacket
[00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:12.280]   and fly to Sun Valley soon.
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:12.840]   I could just-
[00:43:12.840 --> 00:43:14.440]   Oh, he was there?
[00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:18.680]   He was there, and it was like the- you know,
[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:19.800]   there's no media inside,
[00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:24.040]   but from what people heard who were there,
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:26.280]   like he just- yeah, he kind of got grilled.
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:27.880]   Ah, see, that's what I was wondering.
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:30.920]   Standing ovation or booze.
[00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:32.920]   So booze, interesting.
[00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:35.560]   I mean, I don't know that people were actually booing,
[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:37.160]   but I know that the-
[00:43:37.160 --> 00:43:37.640]   Some anger.
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:38.840]   So, it would go well for him.
[00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:40.520]   Well, it should go well for him.
[00:43:40.520 --> 00:43:42.840]   That's disruptive to the markets in general.
[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:44.440]   It's disruptive to the whole system.
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:46.600]   Fascinating.
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:49.480]   I for one hope Twitter survives.
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:52.440]   I think Twitter- yeah, it's not a good business,
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:55.240]   but I think it has huge value to our society.
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:57.880]   And I hope- you know, I don't know.
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:58.600]   What should it be a-
[00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:01.480]   I don't know, should it be a public interest?
[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:03.320]   Corp, what should it be?
[00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:03.960]   I don't know.
[00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:05.880]   It should somehow survive.
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:12.280]   Well, my original idea years ago was that news organizations
[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:19.400]   should pool together and turn it into a 21st century version of Raiders or A.D.
[00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:24.520]   and monetize it, but also keep it open for everybody.
[00:44:24.520 --> 00:44:26.680]   I mean, that to me would have made the most sense.
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:29.080]   And at that point, this was before Twitter went public.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.520]   That would have been more of a utility play,
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:37.640]   and I think that would have been a longer term- a better longer term
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:42.040]   like a better longer term plan.
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:45.960]   Maybe Jeff Bezos will sweep in and turn into a public benefit corporation.
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:48.760]   I don't know.
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:50.680]   I think he's distracted with other things right now.
[00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:53.960]   Bezos made the deal for the Washington Post at the Allen & Co.
[00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:56.200]   CONFAB some years ago.
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:57.640]   So that's where those deals get made.
[00:44:57.640 --> 00:44:59.800]   Maybe Elon will come away with something.
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:02.200]   Besides a bloody nose.
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:05.880]   So I just looked it up.
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:10.760]   Reuters has a story about Elon Musk captivating Sun Valley.
[00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:11.560]   Captivating.
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:13.240]   Captivating him.
[00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:15.240]   Well, you got to imagine if he walks in the door,
[00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:19.240]   he's the object of a lot of interest.
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:24.200]   He was interviewed by Sam Altman, who's now CEO of OpenAI.
[00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:29.400]   Yeah, it was a...
[00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:30.760]   Wow, I would love to be a fly on the...
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:34.440]   One of the quotes was, "I'd hate to be Twitter where you have to take this guy seriously."
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:35.720]   Anyways.
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:39.160]   I think Twitter needs a new board.
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:43.400]   They need a new CEO, and they need to be somehow funded in such a way
[00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:47.480]   that they can be a public benefit corporation and not a new mission.
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:48.360]   There's a new mission.
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:48.840]   Yeah.
[00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:49.240]   Yeah.
[00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:50.440]   Because I mean, there's to...
[00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:51.960]   I still have to say, since the Elon thing,
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:53.640]   I spent a lot more time on Twitter.
[00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:56.200]   And there's so much valuable information there.
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:59.080]   There's a lot of garbage, but there's a lot of value of information.
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:00.520]   And you kind of are in control of it.
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:04.920]   And I think since they're acquisition of Nuzzle, I mean, to that point, Amy,
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:07.640]   they've actually done a good job with the topics.
[00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:08.840]   Oh, the new Blue Server...
[00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:10.920]   I was a power user on Nuzzle.
[00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:12.360]   I had made hundreds of customers.
[00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:12.600]   Oh, me too.
[00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:13.320]   I loved it.
[00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:16.200]   And I was using it as a way of aggregating single data.
[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:16.200]   I know.
[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:17.000]   And it was sad.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.040]   And what's resulted is totally...
[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:21.800]   I mean, I pay for the Twitter Blue Server.
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:23.320]   It's just a shadow of the...
[00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:24.840]   It's a shadow of what it used to be.
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:25.400]   Nuzzle.
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:25.880]   I agree.
[00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:26.680]   I agree.
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:30.280]   But it's something, and I have to say, the top articles section.
[00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:31.960]   And now they've added people.
[00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:34.440]   Besides people, you follow, they've added a Nuzzle-like people.
[00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:38.520]   The people you follow follow tab, which is exactly the same.
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:40.040]   Because I guess I follow the same people.
[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:42.600]   We follow the other people who follow the same people.
[00:46:42.600 --> 00:46:45.560]   But anyway, I think that's a value.
[00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:50.200]   That recognizes the importance of Twitter as kind of a news feed,
[00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:51.640]   as the dial-plan of the internet.
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:54.520]   This is a product that basically has not evolved.
[00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:57.320]   Not seriously, since it's launched.
[00:46:57.320 --> 00:46:58.680]   So there's a certain...
[00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:05.560]   I mean, I had some conversations with them about why they weren't evolving.
[00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:09.560]   And the answer I always got was, well, the DNA of the place was,
[00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:11.720]   let's just build it and see what happens.
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:12.840]   There was no real planning.
[00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:15.720]   And that may be true in the beginning.
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:17.960]   But if you're trying to grow and scale a company,
[00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:21.240]   at some point you have to do longer-term planning,
[00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:23.400]   and you have to be able to execute against that plan.
[00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:27.000]   Dussel was created by Jonathan Abrams, who was a creator of Friendster.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.200]   And...
[00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:29.960]   Yeah, he's... Have you ever met him?
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:30.840]   Oh, yeah. I've interviewed him.
[00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:31.320]   Awesome.
[00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:32.920]   I love that guy.
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:36.360]   He's always like slightly too ahead of the market.
[00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:37.800]   And I don't think when he made Nuzzle,
[00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:41.560]   I don't think he was trying to make a huge business.
[00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:43.480]   I just think he thought it was kind of cool and interesting.
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:46.360]   And that was what I gathered.
[00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:49.160]   We interviewed him. I think he was on triangulation some years ago when he...
[00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:51.000]   Because I was a big Nuzzle fan.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.800]   He's very, very smart. He's a great guy.
[00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:58.040]   I still can use top articles like I used Nuzzle.
[00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:00.920]   In fact, I still can use Twitter as I used Nuzzle,
[00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:04.360]   which is essentially to see what's going on for the shows,
[00:48:04.360 --> 00:48:06.520]   and to bookmark important stories for the shows.
[00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:09.720]   And it's still a good feat of news if you follow the right people and all that.
[00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:13.560]   So I hope Twitter survives this frickah.
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:19.560]   I certainly miss it in the couple of weeks where I have been off of it.
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:24.360]   And as I mentioned earlier, I don't get a chance to share stuff.
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:28.840]   But I also have had to try to find alternate ways of finding the news.
[00:48:28.840 --> 00:48:31.240]   When you're covering and paying attention to tech,
[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:33.400]   it's kind of the best way to get there.
[00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:39.080]   And I've suddenly I'm subscribed to a lot more newsletters than I have.
[00:48:39.080 --> 00:48:41.320]   So interesting.
[00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:43.560]   That's the new way, isn't it?
[00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:44.920]   Yeah, but it's still slower.
[00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:47.560]   You wait for the newsletter to come to you, right?
[00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:51.480]   And with Twitter, it's just there in your feed.
[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:55.800]   I often find myself watching TV or doing stuff, cooking,
[00:48:55.800 --> 00:49:00.280]   and I'll have Twitter scrolling just to kind of keep an eye out.
[00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:01.240]   You do.
[00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:04.440]   I mean, doesn't everybody feel like that that's the buzz?
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:05.560]   That's where things are happening.
[00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:08.680]   And if something happens, you're going to know about it first on Twitter,
[00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:10.520]   particularly in tech.
[00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:15.480]   I think there's, I think, you got to remember that most people are not on Twitter.
[00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:17.640]   And that's not how they find out about things.
[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:21.720]   No, but every year's organization, every news organization.
[00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:23.320]   I mean, go ahead, Connie.
[00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:24.120]   You were going to say something.
[00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:26.680]   No, Amy was going to say something.
[00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:27.480]   Oh, Amy was going to say something.
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:27.960]   Oh, I was.
[00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:33.880]   I was more just going to say, I think the difference in the year 2022 versus the year,
[00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:36.840]   whatever, 2006 is just diffusion.
[00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:40.440]   We don't have a small concentration of networks.
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:41.000]   Right.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:45.560]   All the journalists that I'm friends with have moved on.
[00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:46.760]   And you've got Discord.
[00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:47.560]   You've got Keybase.
[00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:49.160]   You've got all of these other places now.
[00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:53.560]   And vehicles, like media has consolidated.
[00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:57.080]   The channels for distribution have changed.
[00:49:57.080 --> 00:50:02.840]   And so I think it's a little harder to find those important pockets of what's happening
[00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:04.360]   and the people who are talking about them.
[00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:06.200]   But Twitter is it.
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:07.400]   I mean, you don't go to Facebook.
[00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:10.200]   I mean, I don't know when I know goes to Facebook for news.
[00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:13.480]   I actually normal people probably do in great numbers.
[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:18.600]   So Twitter to both points being made is a great place to find out what's going on.
[00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:22.760]   If you follow certain people, then you first of all, create your own filter bubble.
[00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:23.400]   Right.
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:25.160]   So that's an aside.
[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:29.640]   But there is no one place to go to find out, you know, everything that's happening.
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:33.720]   And the advantage of a place like Twitter, at least at the beginning, was that it
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:38.440]   allowed people to know what was going on as quickly as insiders did.
[00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:38.680]   Right.
[00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:42.200]   I worked for Bloomberg for many years and they had the headline service,
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:45.240]   which was basically Twitter, right, before we were here.
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:48.440]   But you had to have a very expensive Bloomberg terminal to watch.
[00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:48.920]   Correct.
[00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:53.240]   You had to pay for that information and then you, it was all about making money, right?
[00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:55.320]   No one made money on it because people needed it.
[00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:57.160]   They wanted it ahead of the market, right?
[00:50:57.160 --> 00:51:02.760]   And so the potential for Twitter to tell you what's happening in the world quickly
[00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:07.880]   and to have that information disseminated, you know, equally to anybody who subscribes is there.
[00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:14.200]   But obviously that business model and also the use of social media has been so corrupted
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:18.520]   that you almost have to hit a reset button, I think, on what it needs to be.
[00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:22.360]   And I agree that if there was a moment in time where it could have been a utility
[00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:27.160]   for new services to be that, why your service to the world free,
[00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:32.520]   that people could find out what was happening and they would see quickly.
[00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:36.680]   That might have changed some of the way public discourse has gone on in this country.
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:38.280]   Well, that's a missed opportunity.
[00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:40.920]   Mike Bloomberg made a little bit of money on those terminals.
[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:44.840]   What do you think that the term is the terminal as important and successful as it used to be?
[00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:53.640]   I mean, it is to people who are setting up trades and want to act instantly on news because in the
[00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:58.200]   world of the stock market and others can speak to this as well, it's about, you know, having a,
[00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:02.920]   you know, microsecond advantage when you're buying something if it's going up and if it's
[00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:08.760]   going down, so there's a lot of automated trades in that system set up to react on news. So
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:14.200]   in terms of what's happening generally in the world, I think you can find out that, you know,
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:20.280]   the former prime minister of Japan was assassinated on Twitter. You don't need a Bloomberg or
[00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:26.360]   Reuters terminal anymore to do that. But from a financial perspective, where seconds or milliseconds
[00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:31.320]   or fractions of a second matter with these automated trades, there is an advantage, which is why people
[00:52:31.320 --> 00:52:37.560]   still buy. Two thousand a month. 24,000 a year. It seems like Twitter missed a boat there.
[00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:42.360]   They could have had something speaking of boats. I like wonderful having the three of you.
[00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:48.600]   I love it when we can get great smart people on Dwight Silverman, formerly of the Houston Chronicle.
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:52.120]   Still, I guess, of the Houston Chronicle, authory.com/d-silberman.
[00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:55.480]   Still riding there. Yes. Still there. They won't let him retire.
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:53:01.960]   Trizy Mike, Connie Gogelmo, editor in chief of CNET. Don't get better than that.
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:09.800]   Top person at CNET. Amy Webb, futurist, and always a pleasure to have all three of you
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:15.240]   on the show. I'm going to be on a boat on Saturday much. I'm a little worried.
[00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:21.400]   We thought COVID to be over by now, but we're going on a Twit Cruise with 100
[00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:27.080]   followers, which is great. Can't wait to meet you all. I thought, well, you know how it is on a
[00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:29.880]   cruise. You like to dress up a little bit. I thought this is a good special occasion.
[00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:37.560]   I went to Indochino, our sponsor, and I got myself some nice stuff. I'm not going to show it today.
[00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:42.280]   I have showed it before, but I want to surprise people on the fancy night on the boat. I've got
[00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:50.120]   a beautiful blue, I think purple velvet, like tuxedo with satin lapels. I got some beautiful
[00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:57.960]   Indochino shirts that I'm going to wear. I am ready. If you are getting ready for a special event,
[00:53:57.960 --> 00:54:03.400]   maybe you've got a wedding coming up and you want to be in a wedding party, or maybe you just
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:09.080]   want to look your best for date night. I want you to look at Indochino. You look great. You feel
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:13.480]   confident, and you'll enjoy that big day without fussing over your clothes. The secret is,
[00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:22.200]   everything is custom made to your exact specifications and measurements. Sometimes when you get all
[00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:29.320]   dressed up, you feel uncomfortable. If it's custom made for you, you feel like you're in your own
[00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:34.840]   skin. You'll look great, but you also feel great. With Indochino, you could choose every detail on
[00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:40.440]   a suit, on a shirt, on a dinner jacket. No, you're not paying a king's ransom. In fact,
[00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:47.080]   you'll be pleasantly surprised at how inexpensive, completely custom tailored clothing can be.
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:52.040]   Every suit made to your exact measurements. You can customize every detail. We chose the
[00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:59.720]   lining. We chose the buttons, the lapel shape, the monograms. The best part, Indochino suits
[00:54:59.720 --> 00:55:06.200]   started $429. And shirts from just $79. They fit perfectly. I haven't even opened these shirts yet,
[00:55:06.200 --> 00:55:10.360]   but I've opened others, and I know these are exactly the same measurements. This will be
[00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:18.040]   perfect. It'll have a necktie without choking out, because the collar is exactly the right size.
[00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:25.480]   Indochino offers completely custom fitted shirts. Yes, they have casual wear. You can get a complete
[00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:30.520]   wardrobe personalized to your style and taste without spending a fortune. And they're always adding
[00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:37.000]   new stuff, which makes it really fun to go to Indochino.com and check it out. Stay in trend,
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:45.880]   stay in style. I think the best way to describe it is relaxed yet refined. The new suits are out
[00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:51.400]   for spring and summer, new spring pastels. If you've got a big day coming up, you just want to look
[00:55:51.400 --> 00:55:59.000]   good. Getting the perfect look is no big deal Indochino, I-N-D-O-C-H-I-N-O. In fact, right now,
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:04.440]   you're going to get $50 off any purchase of $399 or more. Just use the promo code TWIT.
[00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:11.080]   So we'll help you out in this new look at yours. Indochino.com, $50 off a purchase of $399 or more.
[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:18.840]   I-N-D-O-C-H-I-N-O.com. And don't forget to use the code TWIT so they know that you saw it here.
[00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:23.880]   And if you're on the cruise with me next week, look for a guy in a sharp purple tuxedo.
[00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:28.840]   It really looks good. I know when I say purple, this is sound good. It really looks good. I
[00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:32.760]   think. I can't wait. I want it to be a little fun.
[00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:39.320]   All right, back to the news. Enough Elon. Spent an hour on that. But I thought, you know,
[00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:43.800]   it's a fascinating story. That's why, by the way, I guess if you're saying, you know, that
[00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:51.240]   everything's heading towards this kind of drama, it's because we in the press love it.
[00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:54.760]   It makes great headlines. It drives traffic, right, Connie?
[00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:59.080]   It does. But I would be happy for some quiet times.
[00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:08.200]   No, not going to happen. Never going to happen. I'm sorry to say. Amy was in Portofino when the
[00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:14.520]   Dobbs decision came down. And I apologize for harassing you in Italy, Amy, because I really
[00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:24.440]   wanted to get some women on to talk about that. There is, of course, a lot of consequences in the
[00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:32.280]   tech world to this. Google has now said they are going to stop tracking, location tracking,
[00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:39.960]   when you go somewhere sensitive, like say, an abortion clinic. That is a real problem because
[00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:47.560]   that information is being sold and fairly easy to get by third party data brokers.
[00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:53.720]   And I can just imagine, in fact, the President Biden, the White House put out a warning to women
[00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:58.680]   saying, if you're in one of the states where abortion is illegal, stop using period tracker apps.
[00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:04.600]   Is that really the way to solve this? Or maybe we need some better privacy protections.
[00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:14.120]   The EU, at least, is doing something about it. The EU has passed now two new
[00:58:15.800 --> 00:58:27.160]   regulations, the DSA, the Digital Services Act, and is it the DMA? Digital. Now I've lost track
[00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:36.440]   of the two different regulations. Yeah, the DMA, these are not, they're related, but
[00:58:36.440 --> 00:58:46.920]   did cover different things. The Digital Markets Act, the DMA is going to require companies like
[00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:54.360]   Google to stop self-dealing, for instance. It's going to affect Apple and Google's App Store,
[00:58:54.360 --> 00:59:00.360]   for instance. The DSA is a little bit, at least among geeks, a little bit more
[00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:08.520]   controversial, because although it seems to mostly be aimed at interoperability,
[00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:15.720]   letting making messaging apps, for instance, interoperate. And only if you have 45 million
[00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:22.200]   monthly active users, so you have to be a big guy. So it's about WhatsApp, Apple, companies like that.
[00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:29.240]   But there's some concern that the DSA, oh, no, I'm sorry, the DMA is gatekeepers,
[00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:38.280]   the DSA. So confusing. There's some concern that this interoperability solution will impact end-to-end
[00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:45.240]   encryption. Amy, I know you're a fan because you mentioned once again, Keybase, which was all
[00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:50.280]   about end-to-end encryption, and you're using it as a messaging system. It is end-to-end encrypted
[00:59:50.280 --> 01:00:00.360]   messaging, right? Right. So here's what I, you know, China and the United States are
[01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:06.360]   very far ahead of the rest of the world in certain areas of tech, for example,
[01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:13.000]   artificial intelligence. And I like to say that the EU's primary contribution in terms of innovation
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:19.720]   is like policy and regulation. So this has been coming for a while, but as with other,
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:27.400]   especially privacy-related regs, you know, enforcement and compliance has always been a real
[01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:34.040]   challenge. And we already saw that with GDPR. What would it actually take for the DMA portion of this
[01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:41.160]   to be enforced? I think the European Commission has set up some type of task force with a couple
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:48.840]   dozen people. But, you know, they don't just have organizations within Europe and businesses.
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:54.840]   It's anybody who's dealing in any type of information anywhere around the world and in that territory.
[01:00:54.840 --> 01:01:00.840]   And so while it's certainly laudable to make everything interoperable, the question really
[01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:07.000]   becomes like, how do they actually enforce this? Will they have the people to do that? I think
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:14.600]   they're also setting up some type of special transport, some type of special group on algorithmic
[01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:22.600]   transparency. Yeah, which is crazy. They somehow want to know what's the algorithm.
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:28.200]   Right. I think this is going to result in
[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:38.920]   lots of lawsuits. Certainly the big tech companies challenging this or trying to mitigate some of
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:48.600]   the damage. There's also an advertising piece of this. I think the DSA is now banning any type
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:55.080]   of content that could be considered advertising to minors. As far as dark patterns. Dark patterns
[01:01:55.080 --> 01:02:01.160]   and also PIIs. So any type of identifiable information that might be used to target you,
[01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:07.480]   let's say in a Facebook ad or an Instagram ad based on your gender or your location or things
[01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:12.840]   like that. And that's not even an opt-in. I think it's just an outright ban. And it also
[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:17.800]   includes politics. So I'm not sure what the fate of political advertising now looks like in Europe
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:24.120]   going forward. So it's a pretty big game changer. Yeah, a monkey wrench in the business model for
[01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:31.000]   so many companies. And even though it's only you as EU goes, we've learned from GDPR.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:37.480]   Well, how many cookie banners did you see this week? That's not a law in the United States,
[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:43.400]   but because of GDPR and European regulations, every site that has European visitors has to adhere
[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:50.760]   to this law. So this is dramatic. And by the way, the fines for the DSA are 6% of your worldwide
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:59.480]   revenue up to 6%. It could be significant. And more, if you fail, double that if you fail to comply.
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:09.160]   The DMA is a mere 4% of global revenue. So CNET, let me ask about CNET, Connie. I know you're on
[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:14.840]   the news side, but still you're global, right? You're not going to say you're not going to put up a
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:20.200]   banner that somebody coming in from the EU. Oh, sorry, you can't read our stuff. That would be bad for
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:26.920]   a lot of reasons. No, I mean, we, like everyone else, has to put up a disclaimer asking people
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:33.000]   to approve cookies or how their information is collected or shared. So that, you know--
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:39.800]   That's GDPR right there. That's GDPR and that's an extension. These two nude the DMA and DSA.
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:45.480]   I think of them slightly differently. The DMA is about competition and protecting competition from
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:51.320]   protecting companies who want to compete in digital marketplaces in the DSA.
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:57.880]   To me, it's more about consumer protection and some of the negative effects of data collection
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:03.160]   there. But nonetheless, Amy spot on. You can do whatever you want. And I get, I applaud the EU
[01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:09.080]   for taking the lead. These are complicated issues. And if it takes years to levy fines or litigate,
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:13.160]   you're not going to change behavior right away, right? People are not going to stand up and do the
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:17.160]   right thing. But GDPR did. I mean, people, even though there hasn't been a lot of--
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:22.760]   Although it took a while. But yet, well, it's only a few years. And there haven't been a lot of big
[01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:27.480]   fines. So some people are saying, well, they're not going to force it or who cares. But it has,
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:31.960]   in effect, people pay good actors anyway on the internet pay attention.
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:37.400]   Now, I'm glad that these issues are being discussed because you started this question talking about
[01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:44.200]   the implications of the US throwing out Roe v. Wade and what effect that has on data collection.
[01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:51.160]   And we're seeing that. What a mess basically has ensued. And who's interpreting it and what
[01:04:51.160 --> 01:04:57.960]   information and should-- Is your phone, is that data you or now is that a weapon that can be used
[01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:02.760]   against you if you're looking for health information, the most personal health information that you
[01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:08.520]   could possibly look for. So it's just that we're at the beginning of an absolute not a mess in terms
[01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:15.640]   of how these regulations and laws come into play. Who's the winners in all of this, the lawyers,
[01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:19.000]   because there's going to be a lot of lawsuits. Lawyers, see you guys, you should have gone to law
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:24.840]   school. The lawyers always win. Actually, the happiest lawyers I know are former lawyers.
[01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:31.640]   I'll just throw that out there. Yeah, President Biden, I don't know how effective it will be,
[01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:38.440]   but put out an executive order, as I mentioned, urging the FTC and other executive entities to
[01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:43.400]   examine and reinforce data protection policies. I mean, it's an executive order. It's not an
[01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:51.160]   act of Congress. And it could be more performative political poppycock.
[01:05:51.160 --> 01:06:01.240]   But it's definitely an issue. And maybe Congress needs to act. But again, legislation,
[01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:07.960]   we have this conversation a lot. We have people on all areas of the spectrum on this subject,
[01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:11.880]   including some who say that nothing government could do will be of value.
[01:06:11.880 --> 01:06:20.120]   I'm kind of more, look, maybe government's not perfect, but this is the society's chief way of
[01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:26.280]   expressing its need from these tech companies and letting the tech companies decide is the worst
[01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:32.680]   idea. So we've got to do something. But there's an interesting paradox that's going to have to get
[01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:40.680]   resolved because up until Roe, tech companies were very much on the side of not controlling,
[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:47.640]   not allowing a lot of transparency into the flow of data and information. And suddenly,
[01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:55.640]   this is like COVID in a way, because it's forcing them into a sea change overnight.
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:07:00.440]   There are states, including, I think, the state of Indiana and South Carolina,
[01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:06.760]   that are actively now working to create laws that will punish anybody for traveling out of
[01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:15.320]   state for an abortion. Trying to use some of the human trafficking, I think, laws as a backbone for
[01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:20.680]   that. And part of how they're going to do that is by using license plate scanning technology,
[01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:27.240]   and then to the extent they can purchase or get a hold of those third party data to track people
[01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:33.960]   using mobile phones. So I think this is going to force companies, finally, to come to terms with
[01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:39.800]   who exactly are they custodians of data, who gets access to the data, how transparent are they
[01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:47.240]   going to be about who's sharing data? Well, here's an example. This is from TechCrunch writing about
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:53.480]   the presidential, Devin Coldway writing about the presidential proclamation or executive order.
[01:07:54.280 --> 01:08:01.560]   HIPAA is a perfect example of the health insurance portability and something act,
[01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:07.480]   which protects your privacy of medical records. So that's a federal non-disclosure law,
[01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:15.240]   comes in direct conflict with state forced disclosure laws. States are saying, no, no, no,
[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:22.200]   we need to know who went to that abortion clinic. That's a federal versus state thing. I don't know
[01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:27.960]   this is going to go on in the courts for years. HIPAA has been sort of like canon,
[01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:31.880]   undisputable. That is the one thing that nobody is willing to violate.
[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:40.600]   Except these state legislatures. So we'll see what the, and I guess this is one, I guess,
[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:44.600]   it's going to be decided in court and far too much of this is decided in court at this point.
[01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:51.960]   Leo, I live in, I happen to live in one of those red states that where a lot of this is going on
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:58.600]   and in fact, there's the law here in Texas that anybody can sue anyone else for helping someone
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:07.400]   else get an abortion, which was essentially taking that and putting it in the hands of civil courts.
[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:13.720]   It was fairly effective even before Roe versus Wade and major chilling effect.
[01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:21.640]   And the legislators that put that bill forward and voted on it are kind of
[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:26.920]   salivating at what they're going to be able to do when the Texas legislature meets in January.
[01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:33.960]   They meet on odd numbered years. And there is talk about going after companies like Google
[01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:40.680]   and Apple who want to pay the travel expenses for their employees to go out of state to get
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:47.080]   abortions. And obviously in order to find out about some of that, they're looking at data.
[01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:50.520]   And it's going to be quite the fight in January.
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:56.280]   And meanwhile, I don't know if I can just say one quick thing.
[01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:57.480]   Please, yes, Amy.
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:06.440]   Politics aside, this will have dire economic consequences for every single state that is pursuing
[01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:16.040]   the edge cases of enforcing or even expanding on this law or that the change in law change in policy.
[01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:23.400]   >> What are the knock on impacts? You're going to have businesses,
[01:10:23.400 --> 01:10:28.040]   you're going to have changes in workforce. There may be people who decide to stay in the state,
[01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:32.840]   but you're definitely going to have people who will look to go elsewhere.
[01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:36.680]   >> Google has said you may relocate for any reason and we won't deny it.
[01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:38.200]   You don't have.
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:41.960]   >> You'll have people who don't like think of the state of Texas. You've got some pretty
[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:48.680]   terrific universities. If you have a choice to go to rice for medical school or to go
[01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:55.560]   anywhere else, because there are research related consequences to this as well.
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:11:01.720]   I don't think people have fully thought through the long-term economic impacts this is going to
[01:11:01.720 --> 01:11:08.520]   bring on their states and communities. So in addition to everything else, there was a business
[01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:15.320]   case and an economic case to be made for why this was such a stupid, stupid idea and pursuing it
[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:20.360]   the way now that the states of Indiana and some other states are, just tells me that the people
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:25.160]   who are in charge are incapable of playing out what the future might look like forward.
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:31.400]   >> I would put it another way, I would say. And by the way, obviously,
[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:38.520]   I am in favor of, I'm a very much pro-choice. And if I weren't, my wife would kill me.
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:46.680]   I would say there is a mismatch, it's an impedance mismatch. You're asking for long-term strategic
[01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:55.960]   planning. The legislatures who are passing these bills are not thinking about, and I think actively
[01:11:55.960 --> 01:12:01.480]   not thinking about long-term economic consequences, they are trying to save the lives of these unborn
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:05.560]   children. And from their point of view, unless they're very cynical, and I'm going to give them
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:11.960]   credit for not being cynical, this is merely a way of stopping this murderous practice of abortion.
[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:17.880]   And so it's a mismatch. You're asking to think strategically. But even if you say that,
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:21.960]   well, what about the economic consequences, Senator? They'll say, well, it doesn't matter,
[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:27.240]   we're saving the lives of children. >> But this is the result of strategy, a very,
[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:34.120]   very effective long-term strategy that was mastered. So that's like the weird paradox here.
[01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:38.920]   >> But I'm going to give them credit, though, still for, yes, they look at the Republicans
[01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:45.640]   with the plaintiffs for 30, since Alito was put up in the Supreme Court, it's clearly a very
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:49.640]   successful long-term strategy. But I still say, I don't want to say they're cynical in this,
[01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:53.880]   I'm going to say they're doing this because they deeply believe in their heart of hearts
[01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:59.640]   that abortion is wrong. >> But if they're going to come into, one of the big conflicts they're
[01:12:59.640 --> 01:13:04.280]   going to come into, particularly in states like Texas and North Carolina, where they have actively
[01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:11.640]   recruited California-based technology companies. There's a huge Apple presence in Austin, there's
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:18.680]   a huge Google presence in Austin and in Dallas and Houston. And they have been recruiting them here.
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:28.520]   HPE moved to Houston. Their headquarters are now here. And they're all saying, we will pay this.
[01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:33.000]   And it was a major effort on the part of multiple governors to get them here.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:38.120]   And now suddenly you're going to be saying, well, if you're here, you can't do this
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:45.320]   humane action for your employees. And you talk about economic consequences.
[01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:49.400]   Yeah, you're right because you are going to start having people leave.
[01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:53.720]   Yeah, but that's what I'm saying is they're not thinking about that.
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:14:03.160]   Or maybe they are. I mean, Tabby, they don't care. And I think I kind of agree that at the base
[01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:10.520]   of what you're saying, Leo, that they're saving babies. But I also think at this point, it's become
[01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:15.400]   sport. And they're enjoying the strategy of playing whack-a-mole.
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:23.880]   I don't know. I just want to say there's all good points from my columnist. And I agree with all of
[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:30.440]   you. But let's remember, HIPAA is your privacy and protects your privacy when it comes to medical
[01:14:30.440 --> 01:14:36.040]   procedures. And what we know is when laws are passed, people look for loopholes, right? And ways to
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:44.040]   change the way that law was meant to be to suit their own purposes. And so there's going to be
[01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:51.800]   repercussions there because it's your personal health decisions. We've seen that thrown out under
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:58.680]   the guise of some people want to protect some life and discard the life of others. I don't think
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:15:04.040]   it's about saving babies. I think it's about supposedly saving babies. But at the expense of,
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:08.360]   if you're not going to make exemptions for the life of the mother, rape, or incense, then you're
[01:15:08.360 --> 01:15:13.800]   ranking life and you're deciding which life that you want to choose. That is not pro-life.
[01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:17.240]   There's a lot of places on that scale. I mean, not every legislator is saying that.
[01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:22.120]   No, but there's definitely now a movement where some of these regulations are a
[01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:29.080]   very productive and in vitro, whatever. So you have the privacy issues around HIPAA,
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:36.040]   which is established law. And these states are going to start to mess with that because they can
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:39.880]   or they want to or they're on some sort of a valid-- Because we have Supreme Court that doesn't
[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:46.680]   care about established law, right? Right. And then you do have these issues about data collection.
[01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:52.040]   If this device can now be used as a weapon against you that has far-reaching implications,
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:55.880]   not just on businesses and where they want to really, okay, but how you might want to use
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:16:02.840]   this thing in the future and suddenly purging all of your apps and walking away and maybe it will
[01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:08.200]   lead to terms of service that we can actually all understand, right? Which is, you know,
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:12.040]   come in signing with what the EU is doing and trying to raise awareness about privacy, right?
[01:16:12.040 --> 01:16:19.960]   So it's a messy path that we're on with lots of implications and it's just-- It started in the
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:25.320]   wrong place. I was a constitutional law major before I decided I had to go to law school and
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:30.520]   the throwing away of 50 years of precedent and taking back a constitutional right is already
[01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:36.920]   unprecedented. And so it wasn't well thought through. Well, they're going to say, oh, no, wait a
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:42.840]   minute. What about Brown versus Board education? We have overturned judicial precedent in the past.
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:49.560]   Look, I'm-- Constitutional right that was granted. Yeah. I don't want to be on the other side of
[01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:57.000]   that argument. But I also-- I think it's important to just bring up these arguments against it so that
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:02.840]   we-- I don't know. Well, I think, first of all, I want to say-- I want to go home tonight, so I've
[01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:11.960]   got to be very careful here. I think Connie and I are sisters somehow from a-- something mother.
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:15.240]   Made sense in my head. It doesn't make sense as I'm saying it out loud. I wanted to be
[01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:19.640]   solicitor general. Oh, good. That's why I wanted to go to law school. That's the government lawyer
[01:17:19.640 --> 01:17:24.440]   who argues in front of the Supreme Court on behalf of the government. Yeah, that's a good job.
[01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:31.880]   Constitutional law. Yeah. It is a good job. But again, if we think about-- here's the rub for
[01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:39.000]   companies. So it's-- sometimes these events happen that are so disruptive, they force us to
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:44.440]   confront the status quo in a way that can be very productive. So if you think about COVID, which
[01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:49.800]   was horrible, COVID forced us to confront things like the use of messenger RNA, which had existed
[01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:55.800]   for a long time but didn't have a business case and global supply chain volatility and all different
[01:17:55.800 --> 01:18:05.160]   types of things like that. In a way, one of the-- this is a horrific change in America, however,
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:14.120]   not just like abortion aside, this just undermines people's beliefs and institutions even more in it
[01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:20.760]   in a way takes away from what the Supreme Court is and does. The court can't seem-- can't waffle
[01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:26.600]   like this, especially-- and if you read Clarence Thomas's opinion, it's even worse. However,
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:35.240]   when positive outcome might be that we're forced to confront in a very visceral way what data are
[01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:41.160]   being collected and safeguarded. And this could be something that winds up helping Apple in a weird way.
[01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:49.080]   People may-- I'm actually considering going back to an Apple device because of differential privacy.
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:56.280]   Yeah. Yeah. And it could force a change in browser usage. Maybe people will switch over to
[01:18:56.280 --> 01:19:01.000]   brave if they can figure out how to use it or they'll switch over to Safari and they'll
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.800]   take that off the ground. I think that at least with our tech savvy audience,
[01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:08.840]   that transition has already occurred. I mean, our audience is very privacy-aware.
[01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:12.600]   And I would say that we've already-- Yes, this audience is. But I'm talking about my sister.
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:19.320]   Well, that's where it starts, right? Because your sister then asks you, well, gosh, I want to
[01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:27.240]   protect my privacy. How do I do that? And so it starts with the techno savvy who are very privacy
[01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:35.880]   focused. I think there's a general move towards privacy. Honestly, I was a little bit on the fence
[01:19:35.880 --> 01:19:41.480]   saying, well, what's the harm if you're just targeting advertising? The only harm I foresaw is if you
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:47.080]   had a malicious government that would use the information big tech had gathered about you
[01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:52.040]   against you. And now it's happening. So I think now you have a pretty good argument for keeping
[01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:59.640]   your stuff private. It's not just advertising. One other quick thing. So right now, a lot of
[01:20:00.440 --> 01:20:06.360]   digital privacy is decided on by the states. So one of the most restrictive states in the country
[01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:11.080]   is Illinois, which has some-- They have a biometric restriction, right?
[01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:16.120]   They do. So again, if I start thinking through, we'll set aside abortion for a moment, but the
[01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:23.480]   knock-on effects of data and tracing, if I'm a business, this is just going to make it very
[01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:29.320]   challenging to do business across state lines. So should businesses just acknowledge, yeah,
[01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:36.120]   people want privacy, I guess we should stop. Now, I think now is an interesting moment.
[01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:41.160]   First of all, businesses have to really think through their cybersecurity, their data hygiene,
[01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:47.720]   all the super sexy stuff that all of us like to think about, but most organizations don't,
[01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:55.720]   and certainly not their boards of directors. But I think this is an opportunity to sort of
[01:20:57.240 --> 01:21:04.920]   shape the future in a good way. I agree. And it's an inflection point, and it's uncomfortable,
[01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:09.800]   and it's difficult, but it's an opportunity too, and that's the right way to look at it, I think.
[01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:14.120]   You know who doesn't want to talk about it? The Chinese government,
[01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:22.200]   apparently, the Shanghai police force left their personal information of a billion Chinese
[01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:31.320]   citizens online, unprotected for a year, and a hacker says, "I got them, and I'll sell them."
[01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:39.560]   Just a few Bitcoin. The news of this has been suppressed all over China, which makes me think
[01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:47.800]   it's a real deal, right? 23 terabytes of data for 10 Bitcoin, the Shanghai National Police
[01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:56.360]   Database leaked because it was stored. It was secured, but the interface was not,
[01:21:56.360 --> 01:22:01.560]   and somebody discovered it. And I guess over the last year has been exfiltrating
[01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:10.520]   all those terabytes of 23 terabytes of information. Any reports about this in China are being suppressed.
[01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:18.680]   Probably this podcast will now be suppressed in China. I remember being in China watching CNN,
[01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:25.240]   and there was a story about Weagers. Well, at least I think there was, because CNN just went
[01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:31.560]   black for three minutes, and then came back as if nothing had happened. So maybe if this podcast
[01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:38.920]   goes dark for three minutes, you'll know why. You live in China for a long time. What do you think,
[01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:49.160]   Amy? I find this story in a way really hard to believe. If I think through the
[01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:55.720]   system level failures that would have had to have happened, it's really, really bizarre.
[01:22:55.720 --> 01:23:04.040]   It's really bizarre to me that this happened. It was stored apparently on the Alibaba cloud.
[01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:10.920]   We've seen as three buckets be poorly secured on Amazon. This is not hard to do.
[01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:18.600]   It's a strange story. I will tell you that anybody that was involved in this, their lives
[01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:25.320]   are effectively over. I follow a couple of, obviously I'm not on Weibo, but I follow
[01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:30.200]   some people who have access to Weibo and then publish what they're seeing.
[01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:36.600]   Yeah, the lack of this is immediately being censored. Everything is immediately being
[01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:44.520]   taken down. It's one of these great contradictions. Elite hackers are in China,
[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:51.720]   and they left their own store unminded. It's funny. There's some debate over whether this is
[01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:57.640]   accurate data. Some users writing on a cyber crime forum. This is according to the Financial Times
[01:23:57.640 --> 01:24:02.680]   said the data sample include details on picking up packages. So, like suggesting it's not,
[01:24:02.680 --> 01:24:07.080]   it's just a delivery company's database. The Wall Street Journal said at least some of the
[01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:13.320]   information provided was real. Then Chongbeng Zhao, who was the chief executive of Binance,
[01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:19.160]   tweeted that the company Binance had detected the hack and speculated that a government developer
[01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:23.720]   had inadvertently posted credentials to access the database at an online forum.
[01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:29.400]   We'll probably never know. The cynical part of me, Alibaba,
[01:24:29.400 --> 01:24:39.080]   there have been lots of problems. The CCP, the Chinese Communist Party, which one's the government
[01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:46.360]   has really had a magnifying glass in Alibaba. All kinds of problems,
[01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:50.440]   like has been causing problems for their executive leadership. Alibaba, as everybody knows,
[01:24:50.440 --> 01:24:55.480]   has become this incredibly profitable formidable company. So, another part of a
[01:24:55.480 --> 01:25:05.080]   cynical part of me that wonders if the CCP is intentionally doing this, or maybe the hack was
[01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:10.520]   somehow from within as a way of knocking Alibaba a little bit more off of its pedestal,
[01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:14.600]   sending a signal to Alibaba, trying to get them to comply.
[01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:21.880]   You just don't know. There's wheels within wheels. Let's take a little break. Great to have the
[01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:27.800]   three of you. We have lots more to talk about. I'm way behind on commercials because I haven't
[01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:36.920]   so much fun talking about this. Our show today brought to you by userway.org. I am a big fan of
[01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:40.440]   this company and what they do. In fact, if you go to the Twitch page in the lower right-hand
[01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:45.160]   corner, you'll see the little userway bug click that if you want to see what userway can do.
[01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:50.440]   You should know the Americans with Disabilities Act requires every website without exception
[01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:54.680]   to be accessible. They're public entities. The courts have ruled, "No, no, you've got to be
[01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:59.560]   accessible." There was actually a famous case where a pizza company said, "Well, we have a phone
[01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:03.560]   number on our webpage. They could just call that number." The Supreme Court said, "No,
[01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:08.280]   that's not it. You got to be accessible." Userway makes it easy. I think when you're
[01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:11.720]   owner of a business and you hear this, you go, "Well, that's going to cost a lot." No.
[01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:18.040]   Userway is very affordable. It's an AI-powered solution. It enforces the hundreds of WCAG
[01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:22.760]   guidelines, the web content accessibility guidelines set by the World Wide Web Consortium.
[01:26:22.760 --> 01:26:27.560]   It does it all with one line of JavaScript. In a matter of seconds,
[01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:32.280]   userway AI can achieve more than an entire team of developers can in months for a fraction of the
[01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:37.800]   cost. It's simple. It's easy. It's cost effective. I know it seems overwhelming, but let me tell you
[01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:44.680]   first step, go to userway.org/twit and use their free scanning tool just to see how,
[01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:48.280]   what issues there are. Is your website ADA compliant?
[01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:53.560]   If you have an enterprise-level website, you'll be glad to know, even thousands of pages,
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:57.160]   they have a managed solution. Their team can handle everything for you. In fact,
[01:26:57.160 --> 01:27:02.360]   userway is used by over a million websites. It's easily the number one accessibility solution globally.
[01:27:02.920 --> 01:27:10.280]   Coca-Cola, Disney, eBay, FedEx, use Userway. And use their enterprise solution,
[01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:14.840]   but Userway also makes its best-in-class enterprise-level accessibility tools available to small and
[01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:21.960]   medium businesses as well. For as little as $49 a month, less than I pay for the web fonts on our web
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:28.520]   page, you can be fully accessible, ADA compliant. Which, by the way, is not just the law requiring
[01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:33.320]   it. It's good for business. You'll reach more customers, you'll build loyalty. We're going to
[01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:39.160]   give you 30% off. There are a billion people in the world with disabilities, 13% of the population,
[01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:46.040]   who can't use your site if you're not accessible. Userway opens that site up to them.
[01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:54.200]   Just think about it. By not being compliant fines, revenue loss will cost you money. For $49 a month,

[01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:11.880]   technologies. For instance, they've got image recognition that'll automatically generate the
[01:28:11.880 --> 01:28:16.760]   alt tags for your images. You can add to it, but it'll get you started. They can remediate
[01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:21.160]   complex nav menus, ensure that all pop-ups are accessible, then make sure your website uses
[01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:26.280]   accessible colors without changing your color palette, my remaining true to your brand.
[01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:31.160]   You'll also get when you run Userway a detailed report of all the violations fixed. Of course,
[01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:37.320]   you can always go in there. It makes it very easy for you to adjust, to refine, but it gets you started.
[01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:42.440]   Completely platform agnostic. They've got tools that work easily with WordPress, Shopify, Wix,
[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:49.480]   Site Core, SharePoint. Even my little site, Alina JavaScript, it's done. Just ask the voice of
[01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:55.400]   Siri. Susan Bennett, what she thinks about Userway. Hi, I'm Susan Bennett, the original voice of

[01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:56.120]   userway.org/twit. Thank you, Userway. Speaking of China, Wall Street Journal, big article about
[01:29:56.120 --> 01:30:04.360]   the super app. And of course, they're thinking about line, WeChat, YBO, the apps that in Japan and
[01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:13.000]   China, do everything for you. The headline from Christopher Mims, What the Heck is a super app?
[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:20.440]   And why are Elon Musk, Evan Spiegel, and Jack Dorsey so interested? Tell us, Amy, because you've
[01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:26.440]   got an intimate experience with this. What these apps do? Why they're so popular in Asia?
[01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:40.840]   I think, from my point of view, I think it's one-stop shopping. So a lot of those apps,
[01:30:40.840 --> 01:30:44.840]   you can make payments from, you can connect, you can shop, you can do all--
[01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:46.680]   You could buy trade tickets, right? I mean--
[01:30:46.680 --> 01:30:52.600]   Yeah, you can do all different types of things. And if it's a single interface,
[01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:57.480]   I mean, in a way, it's the same reason that Amazon digitally succeeded, right? It was just--
[01:30:57.480 --> 01:30:59.960]   One shop, one shop. One stop shop, yeah.
[01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:02.520]   Right, right. So I think, you know, and there's--
[01:31:02.520 --> 01:31:08.760]   on a lot of these apps, you can perform multiple functions. You don't have to keep switching in
[01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:13.000]   and out of things. You don't have to remember different passwords. It's just easier, I think.
[01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:19.080]   When he was talking to Twitter employees, Elon Musk said he wanted to turn Twitter into a WeChat
[01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:27.240]   like super app. Evan Spiegel, CEO of Snap, called his ideas, Elon's ideas, compelling.
[01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:32.200]   In May, Block Executive, Block of Horse Jack Dorsey's company, Nick Mollmar,
[01:31:32.200 --> 01:31:36.920]   told investors the company plans to turn the combination of its cash app and after pay-by-now,
[01:31:36.920 --> 01:31:41.800]   pay-later service into a super app. PayPal said they're going to make a super app.
[01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:45.960]   But I have to say, I don't think Americans want a super app. What do you think, Connie?
[01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:47.960]   I think we're going to-- Do we want one app that does it all?
[01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:52.280]   I'm like, I don't want to interrupt Amy, so let her--
[01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:53.720]   Finish Amy and then you, Connie.
[01:31:53.720 --> 01:31:57.960]   Oh, sorry. I was just going to say, I absolutely think people want this.
[01:31:57.960 --> 01:32:03.400]   I think the problem is market consolidation. It goes back to Windows,
[01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:08.120]   Internet Explorer territory. But the average person making life easier for them,
[01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:09.080]   absolutely they want it.
[01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:16.200]   I agree with that, except people want things easier until they find out
[01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:22.680]   that it's not good for them, right? There's a reason that people use PayPal to pay for purchases
[01:32:22.680 --> 01:32:25.720]   of cross-sites because they don't want to log in and give their credit card data.
[01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:30.600]   So they definitely want the ease of use. The question that we face here in the US,
[01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:35.640]   because you have so many brands now that have become brands and have built these massive platforms,
[01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:40.760]   is who do you trust that you want to work with? Amazon built trust in the early days to your
[01:32:40.760 --> 01:32:45.400]   point, Leo, because of not just one place to do it, because they had that one click purchase.
[01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:46.200]   Do you remember that?
[01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:47.640]   That was brilliant. They owned it.
[01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:50.520]   For many years, right? Like it just-- What is it?
[01:32:50.520 --> 01:32:56.840]   Friction-free shopping. So this idea of managing your life and doing a lot of different things,
[01:32:56.840 --> 01:33:04.040]   a friction-free way is great. But then the downside is, do you trust these companies?
[01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:09.640]   Do you trust Evan Spiegel or Uber or Elon Musk with all of your purchases
[01:33:09.640 --> 01:33:12.760]   for your data? And we were just talking about when it comes to your health care,
[01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:17.560]   if they turn over your location data to a state that threatens them.
[01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:19.080]   So it's complicated.
[01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:21.240]   It is-- Well, and that's my point.
[01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:22.040]   Utility is good.
[01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:25.320]   It's too complicated. It makes it hard to use, right? If it does everything,
[01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:31.640]   I mean, then it's-- What do you think? You look at consumer tech all the time, Dwight.
[01:33:31.640 --> 01:33:37.080]   Do you think Americans anyway are interested in one app that does everything?
[01:33:37.080 --> 01:33:41.640]   You know, I don't know. They've not seen one app that does everything.
[01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:46.600]   There are a couple of companies that have made noises that that's what they'd want to do
[01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:54.440]   outside of what you mentioned. Facebook, obviously, is kind of trying to make its app and along with
[01:33:54.440 --> 01:34:00.440]   Messenger and WhatsApp, a Swiss Army knife. They've got a shopping component. They have a messaging
[01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:07.720]   component. But it's so diffused throughout the app and people, I think, go to Facebook for
[01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:14.520]   primarily to connect with other people. I don't know that Facebook does it. Apple is kind of quietly
[01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:21.000]   building that into iMessage. Some of the features that are coming in iOS 16 kind of have a whiff of
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:25.400]   that. And they've been-- One of the things that they did-- I don't think anybody's really taking
[01:34:25.400 --> 01:34:30.520]   that much advantage of it-- is that they opened iMessage up to companies who wanted to do tech
[01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:35.480]   support and other kinds of support through it. And I don't think a lot of companies took advantage of
[01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:43.160]   that. So they've played with it a little bit. But to me, I think a lot of Americans think they
[01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:46.280]   want the right tool for the job and that may not be a Swiss Army knife.
[01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:51.000]   Yeah. I mean, I come from the good old days, the Unix background, where you had one thing that did
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:55.800]   one little thing and all you did is had affordances that would allow you to pipe that simple app
[01:34:55.800 --> 01:35:01.320]   into another app into another app and another app and kind of build your own super app for one time
[01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:09.720]   only. What about the argument that Apple already is the super app, that it's the iPhone? And to
[01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:15.560]   your point, Amy, we trust Apple with our privacy. Apple's certainly trying to make it even stronger
[01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:21.320]   with the application tracking transparency and all of those switches. It seems like Apple could do
[01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:26.920]   this, put pain-- you know, they've got Apple Pay, put Apple Pay in every app. Apple could be the
[01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:33.080]   back end for it in a way. That's what your iPhone is, isn't it? Well, I don't have an iPhone anymore.
[01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:36.920]   Oh, that's right. You have an iPhone. You have no idea. Android is not--
[01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:43.400]   No, I have other products. Android is too heterogeneous. It's just a mishmosh of stuff.
[01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:47.800]   Right. I think the better way to think about this is open versus closed ecosystems.
[01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:54.200]   Apple has a-- so Mac OS, that's what it's called for the mobile devices still, right?
[01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:56.600]   Is everything is Mac OS now, right? Yes.
[01:35:56.600 --> 01:35:59.240]   Yes. iOS. Well, no, it's Mac OS for the desktop.
[01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:01.480]   Oh, it's the other way around. Each thing there's--
[01:36:01.480 --> 01:36:05.880]   Watch OS, TVOS, Mac OS, iOS. I know. Okay. I think that OS--
[01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:09.480]   Everything is-- but you're right underneath. It's all Mac OS.
[01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:16.760]   It's a closed ecosystem, I think, is the difference. So-- and Apple doesn't always play nicely with
[01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:21.560]   third parties. So I think that they are-- I would say that my observation is that Apple is moving
[01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:30.760]   more toward making that XOS more closed and more like a super app, at least in terms of its
[01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:37.080]   overall offerings. But there is still a core difference. If you're on WeChat,
[01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:43.480]   which nobody in the United States is going to be on, because it's hard to get an account,
[01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:45.480]   and you have to speak Chinese. But--
[01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:47.400]   Have you used it when you were in China?
[01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:52.120]   I have, yeah. I mean, my living there predates me, but yes, I have.
[01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:58.520]   And Line, which is a Japanese social media app, which has way less functionality. The place to
[01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:03.400]   really look at is China, not Japan. Some say it's because, certainly, as true in Japan,
[01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:09.080]   people had smartphones before they had PCs. Oh, well, we had something called a Pichi.
[01:37:09.080 --> 01:37:14.040]   I've heard you talk about this before. Somewhere. Do you have your Pichi?
[01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:22.040]   I do have my Pichi. Look for your Pichi. Not the Pichi we had in high school with two Es.
[01:37:22.040 --> 01:37:27.560]   No, this was-- it actually stood for something, and I don't remember. The acronym was Pichi,
[01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:37.400]   and I don't remember what it stands for now. But it was a smartphone. It didn't have a
[01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:43.400]   gooey interface, but it did have a file tree interface that you moved around with a little
[01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:47.960]   tiny mouse. It was a little pichi on some tickets on it. Yeah.
[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:53.560]   Somewhere over here, I'll say. I have a picture of one, I guess I can show. Here's a young girl in the
[01:37:54.120 --> 01:38:03.720]   Herajuko district with her Pichi in 2008. Mine was even smaller than that. Mine was like a large
[01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:13.160]   thumb drive. Oh, wow. Oh, so small. There were competing interfaces and competing software and
[01:38:13.160 --> 01:38:21.960]   systems. Basically, this was a pretty smart phone at the time that I had it. This was like
[01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:28.280]   1998. This is going back. Yeah. Before Android, before iOS,
[01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:33.160]   this is when Nokia flip phones were ascended in the US.
[01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:40.200]   I think that some of that might have also been why line and we chat were so big, because you had
[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:44.840]   to do everything on a small device. You didn't have a computer at home.
[01:38:47.480 --> 01:38:53.880]   Japan, there's not a lot of English in Japan, so they built their own ecosystem and line,
[01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:58.440]   which I use because I've got friends in Japan. I can't stand. I don't like the interface. I don't
[01:38:58.440 --> 01:39:07.720]   understand the stickers. I think it's an acknowledgement that it would make sense that there's a diaspora of
[01:39:07.720 --> 01:39:14.760]   how connectivity spread and what makes sense in different countries. But the payment part of
[01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:21.720]   WeChat and I think is sort of the killer function. It's easy. Everything is integrated. You don't
[01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:28.280]   have to click out the messaging part almost as secondary. Yeah. I don't want one big monolithic app,
[01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:37.240]   but I think if you've got a back end like Apple Pay and face recognition that every app supports,
[01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:46.600]   then each app on your iPhone is a part of a larger ecosystem. That's kind of a super app.
[01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:51.960]   So in other words, I think the smartphone is the super app in the US. Maybe not. I don't know.
[01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:59.400]   Connie, have you ever used WeChat or line? I haven't, but I think Amy's point about closed
[01:39:59.400 --> 01:40:03.880]   systems is right. I mean, that's the appeal of Apple to people who are not tech savvy,
[01:40:03.880 --> 01:40:08.680]   that you don't have to be a tech expert. You just log on. Everything works together.
[01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:14.280]   And for a long time, you didn't have to worry about even viruses and the like. So there's definitely
[01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:21.720]   appeal to having that closed ecosystem because it handles a lot of things for you until something
[01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:26.680]   goes wrong. And then that's one of the questions. Or until your period tracking app starts selling
[01:40:26.680 --> 01:40:38.600]   your information to the Texas Rangers. I don't see that as, I don't know. I don't see any of these
[01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:44.440]   apps willingly. Do you remember the San Bernardino shooting that happened? Yes, FBI demanded.
[01:40:44.440 --> 01:40:51.240]   The FBI kind of got into it. Right. I just don't, that I see more of that happening. I don't see
[01:40:51.240 --> 01:40:57.400]   companies trying to earn a quick cash by selling, like ratting out women. I hope not.
[01:40:57.400 --> 01:41:01.560]   And they're menstrual cycles. It doesn't make sense to me. I think it more becomes like,
[01:41:01.560 --> 01:41:12.360]   can a local authority compel a company to hand over that type of data? Well, they may not have to,
[01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:18.440]   because a lot of, because Google and other companies who have this data sell it to data brokers,
[01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:24.120]   and the investigators go to the data brokers and buy it for 170 bucks.
[01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:28.600]   And they have to compel anybody. Right. And that's the thing. It's leaky. It's a leaky system
[01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:32.840]   because of this data broker thing. And companies are happy to do that.
[01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:42.440]   We sell your, we provide your information to third parties in order to improve our services,
[01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:49.960]   like make a little money on the side. I mean, that's in every agreement. All right.
[01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:56.200]   I'm gonna take a little break. I do want to talk about web three and NFTs.
[01:41:56.200 --> 01:42:02.440]   Was that in your, was that in your future today report at the Futures Today Institute?
[01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:09.960]   It was only because we believe that the thing that matters is the underlying infrastructure.
[01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:19.800]   Technology, yes. But if I had a, if I had a nickel for every bro waxing lovingly about his NFT,
[01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:26.840]   you know, I would have, I would have so many nipples. And not one NFT. The future today.
[01:42:26.840 --> 01:42:29.560]   My nickel, all my nickels would be worth more than that.
[01:42:29.560 --> 01:42:34.920]   That's a road future today. Institute.com. They published their tech trends report 15 years.
[01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:39.720]   Now they've been doing it. It's a really great, you can download it yourself. It's a really great
[01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:47.480]   report with lots of information. Amy is not a soothsayer, as she will tell you. She doesn't
[01:42:47.480 --> 01:42:53.000]   predict the future, but she talks about strategic trends. And it's really fascinating.
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:43:00.600]   Also with this Connie Goyama, who covers the day to day to and fro of the tech world as editor in
[01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:08.600]   chief of CNET, which is a lofty position. And we're thrilled to have you here. The lofty
[01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:13.880]   Connie Goyama and Dwight Silverman, who is not lofty. He's just cute.
[01:43:13.880 --> 01:43:20.120]   I have that's a long, that a long time since anyone described me as a cute,
[01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:24.360]   Leo, but I'll take it. You're somebody saying in the chat room, you look like their favorite
[01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:29.000]   science fiction author. I don't know who is that. I don't know. I have to. He said,
[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:36.440]   I just tuned in the video and my God, it's full of stars. No, he says, it's, what did he say? What
[01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:43.400]   his name was it? Anyway, I'll find it if I can. Yeah, you look like a well-known science fiction
[01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:52.200]   author. I got to get on that. Yeah. Our show today brought to you by our fine sponsor,
[01:43:52.200 --> 01:43:58.600]   Eight Sleep. Now, Amy, I credit you with getting me on the eight sleep train.
[01:43:59.240 --> 01:44:06.360]   I love that. I am. This is not like a product endorsement or product placement or anything,
[01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:12.840]   but I have been sleeping on it for, we had a chilly sleep before then. I don't have their mattress
[01:44:12.840 --> 01:44:17.560]   because I like our mattress, but we have the pot. We have the pot. Yeah, same thing. Yeah.
[01:44:17.560 --> 01:44:23.560]   I got to tell you, I am sleeping better than I've ever slept in my entire life.
[01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:30.920]   Unsolicited ladies and gentlemen. Totally unsolicited. I do not sleep well without it.
[01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:36.840]   Yeah. It has totally, I'm more rested. I'm getting better sleep. My quality of sleep is better.
[01:44:36.840 --> 01:44:40.840]   I love this thing. And you learned about it on the show from Kevin Rose, as I remember.
[01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:45.480]   Yep. Kevin was, yeah. Kevin, we had a little side chat and he was like,
[01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:50.120]   you got to get one of these. He was right. We got ours about eight months ago. And just like you,
[01:44:51.320 --> 01:44:55.800]   I'm dreading going on this cruise because I won't have my eight sleep. Good sleep,
[01:44:55.800 --> 01:45:01.960]   obviously. So important. And maybe, maybe you're lucky, you're young, you sleep like a baby,
[01:45:01.960 --> 01:45:07.880]   you don't know yet. But there will come a time in your life where sleep is hard to come by.
[01:45:07.880 --> 01:45:15.240]   And it is rotten. It ruins your life. In fact, lots of studies say that sleep reduces,
[01:45:15.240 --> 01:45:19.880]   good sleep reduces the likelihood of serious health issues. It decreases your risk of heart
[01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:24.440]   disease. It lowers your blood pressure. It can even reduce the risk of Alzheimer's.
[01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:29.720]   And so many of us 30, it's estimated 30% of Americans struggle with sleep. You know what the
[01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:36.840]   number one issue is? It's too hot or it's too cold temperature. That's why we love the eight sleep.
[01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:41.640]   Pod pro cover. Yes, they sell a mattress. We happen to have a lovely mattress that we don't
[01:45:41.640 --> 01:45:47.000]   want to change. So we got the cover. You put it on any mattress and it controls the temperature
[01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:53.560]   from as low as 55 degrees, which is pretty chilly or as high as 110 degrees, which is pretty warm.
[01:45:53.560 --> 01:46:00.760]   And it changes it through the night. The eight sleep cover actually watches your sleep and based
[01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:06.760]   on your sleep stages, on your biometrics, on the bedroom temperature, it actually reacts
[01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:12.120]   intelligently to create an optimal sleep environment. Clinical data shows that eight sleep users
[01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:19.560]   experience up to 19% increase in recovery and 32% improvement in sleep quality, 34% more deep
[01:46:19.560 --> 01:46:25.960]   sleep. For me, deep sleep is the holy grail. If I can get more than half an hour deep sleep every
[01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:30.760]   night and you can find that out, by the way, from the eight sleep app, because it's going to tell you,
[01:46:30.760 --> 01:46:35.480]   I know I will have a great day. And if I get less, I will not. That's because that deep sleep is
[01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:40.920]   where your brain is recovering. It's the garbage clear out on your brain getting rid of all those
[01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:48.360]   preons and expelling them. It's so important. The eight sleep, everybody's different. But I
[01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:56.120]   have this complete made up theory of evolutionary science that I made up that in history,
[01:46:56.120 --> 01:47:02.280]   we've always gone to bed. The fires, we stoke the fire, you go to bed, it's still warm. Maybe
[01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:06.600]   you even have one of those colonial times they had those bed warmers, they put some coals in
[01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:11.160]   and they put in the so you go to bed, you're in a nice warm cozy bed, you fall asleep. And then
[01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:16.440]   over the night, it gets chillier and chillier, which is fine. That's when you go into your deep
[01:47:16.440 --> 01:47:22.440]   sleep cycle. And then in the morning, if you're lucky, you get a nice cup of coffee and you wake
[01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:30.680]   up. This is in a way to duplicate that experience. What I think we're biologically programmed to.
[01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:34.760]   So I have it warm when I get in bed. And then I have the temperature slowly, the client,
[01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:38.840]   as I go into deep sleep, it helps me deep sleep. And then it goes back up again to wake me up.
[01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:43.400]   There's even a little vibration that you can put in there to so you gently wake up, which I love.
[01:47:43.400 --> 01:47:50.360]   Eight sleep is amazing. And we're going to get you a very good Fourth of July savings. But it's
[01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:56.840]   only, oh gosh, you got to go today through July 10th. This is it. This is it. Eight sleep,
[01:47:56.840 --> 01:48:04.280]   EIGHT SLEP.com/twit. Those Fourth of July savings run out today, cool down this summer with eight
[01:48:04.280 --> 01:48:09.960]   sleep. They shipped to the US, Canada, and the UK. And this is new. Select countries in the EU.
[01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:17.800]   And now Australia. You got to get this thing. Do you do you have it to? I have mine set to cook
[01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:23.720]   me awake. Yes. So I, yeah, I haven't used an actual alarm clock to make me up outside of my
[01:48:23.720 --> 01:48:28.280]   house and over a year. And I just wake up. Cook implies that you're sweating and uncomfortable.
[01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:33.640]   It's really nice. It's like, Oh, it's getting warm. I'm ready to get I'm and you know, the worst
[01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:38.600]   thing. By the way, when it's really hot as it has been this summer, you turn it down a little bit.
[01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:43.080]   And it's cool and relaxing. And then when it's cold as it was last winter, you turn it up a little
[01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:48.200]   bit. And it's nice and toasty. You completely control it. There's even a sleep doctor in the app
[01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:52.520]   that will notice, you know, always tossing and turning. Let's let's let's adjust this. It really
[01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:58.360]   works. If you were listening after July 10th, I apologize. This was kind of last minute. But we
[01:48:58.360 --> 01:49:04.440]   have a great hundred fifty dollar discount. So you can still get that eight sleep.com/twit.
[01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:09.800]   Check out the pod pro cover. That's what Amy and I have. I think I feel like Kevin might have had
[01:49:09.800 --> 01:49:17.160]   the mattress because you know, he had the mattress. He's an all in kind of guy eight sleep.com/twit.
[01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:23.320]   You heard it here. I didn't ask. I didn't tell Amy at a time. She just volunteered. I didn't make
[01:49:23.320 --> 01:49:28.680]   you right. I've never met you before. Nothing up my sleeves. That's right. Yeah.
[01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:36.120]   eightsleep.com/twit. We're big fans. Speaking of Kevin Rose, haven't had him on lately
[01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:44.040]   because I'm so many of my good friends, people I really trust and respect have gone down the web
[01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:52.440]   three NFT rabbit hole. And I don't I want to consult with you all because I don't know.
[01:49:52.440 --> 01:49:58.920]   I don't want to promote NFTs. I don't want to promote even cryptocurrency right now
[01:49:58.920 --> 01:50:03.480]   on our shows. We've had some crypto advertisers. Well, I'll give you an example. One of them,
[01:50:03.480 --> 01:50:10.520]   BlockFi. They have a credit card. You get Bitcoin. They just practically went belly up. They got
[01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:14.440]   bought up by FTX, which is going to be the last man standing in all of this.
[01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:26.440]   So many there it is estimated two billion dollars in hacks this year alone on web three projects.
[01:50:26.440 --> 01:50:34.600]   What happened? And then I should I have these guys back on? I mean,
[01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:42.120]   Connie, what is what's your take on web three and NFTs and all of that crypto?
[01:50:42.120 --> 01:50:48.520]   Well, you know, there's a difference between the underlying technology and distributed
[01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:56.280]   technology as a counter to closed networks, which I think underpins blockchain and NFTs.
[01:50:56.280 --> 01:51:04.040]   And then there's crypto and NFTs as a source of scams and concerns and hype. So those are two
[01:51:04.040 --> 01:51:10.840]   different two different things. Obviously, there's a lot of hype and a lot of distrust of people
[01:51:10.840 --> 01:51:18.280]   hyping crypto currencies and FTS. And I'm sorry if you bought an NFT for $50,000 and now it's only
[01:51:18.280 --> 01:51:24.920]   worth a thousand. I don't know what to tell you, but underlying all of that is a new way of looking
[01:51:24.920 --> 01:51:30.440]   at technology in the world that I think a lot of people say is a valid way to hear it.
[01:51:30.440 --> 01:51:38.440]   But I'm not convinced of it. I'm not a grant. You will get a grant. You know, maybe there's some value
[01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:46.120]   to block chain and so forth, although it's hard to show a compelling need for this.
[01:51:46.120 --> 01:51:54.760]   But it's very clear that cryptocurrency is, you know, I just saw a stat, which kind of
[01:51:55.560 --> 01:52:03.080]   was depressing that the number of black people who on cryptocurrency is like twice as high as white
[01:52:03.080 --> 01:52:10.520]   people. Kind of makes sense. Maybe if you're black, you feel disenfranchised. You don't feel like
[01:52:10.520 --> 01:52:15.640]   the cent, you know, with red linings, been a huge problem, central banking system, not your friend.
[01:52:15.640 --> 01:52:21.960]   So you invest in crypto Bitcoin primarily. And what happens? You lose your shirt.
[01:52:23.800 --> 01:52:27.880]   This isn't social justice. This sets up just being more of the same.
[01:52:27.880 --> 01:52:33.720]   Which is why I say there's a separation that we have to look at.
[01:52:33.720 --> 01:52:38.600]   Cryptocurrencies is definitely the wave of the future. And when the US government and
[01:52:38.600 --> 01:52:45.880]   governments weigh in and set up government-backed currencies, that's different. But we're in the
[01:52:45.880 --> 01:52:52.120]   wild, wild, west period. And that's the unfortunate part of this story. But even stablecoin, which
[01:52:52.120 --> 01:52:57.560]   is what governments would presumably do, has stablecoin has not been so stable.
[01:52:57.560 --> 01:53:03.480]   Because there's no regulation. We're still in the wild, wild west of what's going on, right? So
[01:53:03.480 --> 01:53:08.360]   people are making up their own rules. There's a lot of hype. There is distrust of government,
[01:53:08.360 --> 01:53:13.160]   which is what was driving the whole interest in Bitcoin in the first place. But I think also,
[01:53:13.160 --> 01:53:19.720]   there is some bad marketing and PR celebrities talking things and folks saying, I don't know what
[01:53:19.720 --> 01:53:24.680]   it's about, but I missed everything else. So I just want to get in on this, right? And that
[01:53:24.680 --> 01:53:32.760]   plays to part of it as well, unfortunately. We'll say that financial institutions,
[01:53:32.760 --> 01:53:37.880]   because we work with a lot of them, are thinking creatively right now about value creation.
[01:53:37.880 --> 01:53:47.960]   You know, what might the future look like where many things generate value? And you can use that
[01:53:47.960 --> 01:53:51.880]   value in different ways. What if there was an exchange where there were different types of value?
[01:53:51.880 --> 01:54:03.240]   I think this is the opening, sort of beginning experimentation phase. But if you talk to a lot
[01:54:03.240 --> 01:54:11.560]   of people, especially people in tech, about blockchains, oftentimes the use case that people
[01:54:11.560 --> 01:54:18.360]   are coming up with for blockchains is way overly complicated and existing technology will do
[01:54:18.360 --> 01:54:23.800]   just fine. But beyond that, they're opening. It's just the beginning.
[01:54:23.800 --> 01:54:31.480]   I'll quote a current affairs article from May, which talks to a Berkeley professor, Nicholas Weaver,
[01:54:31.480 --> 01:54:37.400]   who says he's a senior staff researcher at the International Computer Science Institute
[01:54:37.400 --> 01:54:43.000]   lecturer in the UC Berkeley Computer Science Department, has been studying cryptocurrency
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:48.760]   for years. And he says, all cryptocurrency should die in a fire. He says, cryptocurrency is
[01:54:48.760 --> 01:54:55.000]   although a seemingly interesting idea are simply not fit for purpose. They do not work as currencies.
[01:54:55.000 --> 01:54:59.720]   They are grossly inefficient. They are not meaningfully distributed in terms of trust,
[01:54:59.720 --> 01:55:05.960]   risks involving cryptocurrencies occur in four major areas. And by the way, he wrote this in May,
[01:55:05.960 --> 01:55:12.840]   but this has all come true. Technical risks to participants, economic risks to participants,
[01:55:12.840 --> 01:55:18.840]   systemic risks to the cryptocurrency system, and societal risks. And we're just starting to see
[01:55:18.840 --> 01:55:25.240]   the societal risks. He said in a lecture this year, this is a virus. Its harms are substantial.
[01:55:25.240 --> 01:55:30.920]   It has enabled billion dollar criminal enterprises. For instance, I don't think ransomware would be
[01:55:30.920 --> 01:55:37.080]   the business it is if it weren't for the easy way to anonymously collect Bitcoin.
[01:55:37.080 --> 01:55:43.240]   Going on with his quote, it has enabled venture capitalists to do securities fraud as their business.
[01:55:43.240 --> 01:55:49.960]   It has sucked people in. So either avoid it or help me make a die in a fire.
[01:55:49.960 --> 01:55:56.360]   So I have also said that argument. Oh, there's the underlying technology. That is of interest,
[01:55:56.360 --> 01:56:02.440]   blockchains of interest, decentralized ledgers of an interest, maybe a stable coin, a digital
[01:56:02.440 --> 01:56:08.600]   currency for a governmental currency. Maybe that's of interest. But his he says, no, there's nothing
[01:56:08.600 --> 01:56:14.200]   good to come out of this. Bitcoin uses the energy of a small to mid-sized country.
[01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:27.960]   Anyway, do you want to defend it, anybody? Is he wrong? Should we all be paying attention?
[01:56:27.960 --> 01:56:35.400]   I think that the the when this started, when the kind of the recent implosion started,
[01:56:35.400 --> 01:56:44.360]   I tweeted that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are essentially approaching their true value,
[01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:52.600]   which is zero. There's no true value to them. Their value is only what people put into them
[01:56:52.600 --> 01:56:58.520]   and are willing to expend on it. But at its base, there's nothing there.
[01:56:58.520 --> 01:57:06.120]   And I agree that the whole idea that once governments get in and back it, the reason we believe in
[01:57:06.120 --> 01:57:12.440]   the dollar and fiat currencies is that governments back it, there's something there. But there's
[01:57:12.440 --> 01:57:19.240]   no there there. And it goes up until it approaches its true value, which is zero.
[01:57:19.240 --> 01:57:27.400]   Do you think Amy Banks will become more decentralized that the notion of a centralized banking system
[01:57:27.400 --> 01:57:32.760]   is a mistake? No, I don't think that's going to happen.
[01:57:35.960 --> 01:57:44.760]   I mean, I can't get into too much detail, but we work with banks and key players in the financial
[01:57:44.760 --> 01:57:51.160]   ecosystem. We're too deeply entrenched to totally disenfranchise our current banking structure.
[01:57:51.160 --> 01:57:56.440]   You could argue though, does a credit card need to exist in the future if there are other means of
[01:57:56.440 --> 01:58:05.400]   transferring and storing value? So again, I think this is we're just in process on an evolution.
[01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:15.560]   Yeah. And 10 years from now, I could see distributed computing systems in our kitchens where the
[01:58:15.560 --> 01:58:21.400]   unused compute from our connected refrigerators are earning fractions of a penny. And maybe our
[01:58:21.400 --> 01:58:29.240]   Comcast or some third party has come in and built a system where we earn credits back and
[01:58:30.440 --> 01:58:36.520]   everybody's creating value. I think that there are platforms like Roblox that have current
[01:58:36.520 --> 01:58:40.920]   Roblox, Second Life, they've got currencies within those ecosystems already.
[01:58:40.920 --> 01:58:45.080]   Yeah, maybe the metaverse is going to become the driving force in all this.
[01:58:45.080 --> 01:58:51.800]   I think the biggest winner out of all of this might be China, which is eager to see
[01:58:51.800 --> 01:58:59.720]   the not not have an alternative to the dollar as the currency that other currencies are pegged to.
[01:58:59.720 --> 01:59:07.480]   So that might be one offshoot. But true decentralization doesn't work within the
[01:59:07.480 --> 01:59:10.360]   existing structures of society.
[01:59:10.360 --> 01:59:18.680]   Maybe you are the only person in the world who knows what Web 3.0 is. I'm looking at the page from
[01:59:18.680 --> 01:59:26.280]   your tech trends 2022. You say Web 3.0 enables people, organizations and systems around the globe
[01:59:26.280 --> 01:59:32.840]   to be seamlessly interconnected while acting independently, allowing for more equitable access
[01:59:32.840 --> 01:59:35.960]   to asset ownership and investment. That sounds pretty good.
[01:59:35.960 --> 01:59:43.160]   Yeah, but again, we see this as an evolution. I was actually talking to Dan Sturman, who's the
[01:59:43.160 --> 01:59:49.960]   CTO of Roblox a couple of weeks ago. He's a really, he's super interesting. He's a super
[01:59:49.960 --> 01:59:57.000]   interesting guy, but he had an interesting take on Web 3 hype. He said Web 3 is a lot like Web 1,
[01:59:57.000 --> 02:00:03.000]   which is to say infrastructure layer. It's Web 4. So the thing that comes afterwards that is
[02:00:03.000 --> 02:00:06.600]   in a way more compelling or as Jack Dorsey would call it Web 5.
[02:00:06.600 --> 02:00:09.240]   Layer comes in. Yeah.
[02:00:09.240 --> 02:00:13.720]   I guess he just want to skip for it.
[02:00:14.440 --> 02:00:23.240]   And I guess, I guess. Do you think governments are hostile to all of this? Because after all,
[02:00:23.240 --> 02:00:30.200]   yeah, I mean, it deals them out, doesn't it? I think governments have been asleep at the
[02:00:30.200 --> 02:00:36.840]   wheel to be perfect. Many governments certainly ours. That was not true of China and other
[02:00:36.840 --> 02:00:42.840]   governments around the world. In 2020, I was at in Davos World Economic Forum and there was
[02:00:43.480 --> 02:00:50.040]   a whole entire track on blockchains and cryptos. And at that point, Facebook's currency was still
[02:00:50.040 --> 02:00:53.640]   called Lira. Right? That was the original name of it. Yeah, they killed it. But yeah,
[02:00:53.640 --> 02:00:59.400]   they killed it. They killed it shortly after that. But, you know, there was a lot of argument in the
[02:00:59.400 --> 02:01:06.920]   room about what they were trying to build. I was in a session after that with the head of Singapore.
[02:01:06.920 --> 02:01:14.920]   Singapore was moving ahead on its own CBDC. So I think a lot of governments have been dancing
[02:01:14.920 --> 02:01:20.040]   around this, but their interpretation of what's being built. And I think the sort of conversation
[02:01:20.040 --> 02:01:26.920]   on Reddit, that's a pretty big chasm. Yeah. Well, unfortunately, the conversation on Reddit is
[02:01:26.920 --> 02:01:32.600]   what has driven all the markets, right? Yeah. And people have lost money. And, you know,
[02:01:32.600 --> 02:01:37.800]   they've been, but there it is. I guess there is, I could see a world where
[02:01:37.800 --> 02:01:46.520]   authentication and provenance is reliable, where there's a decentralized financial system
[02:01:46.520 --> 02:01:54.200]   that isn't dependent on any individual company or even government. I could see the advantage.
[02:01:54.200 --> 02:02:00.920]   But it will be. Nothing will listen, somebody still has to like manage and maintain the pipes.
[02:02:00.920 --> 02:02:06.520]   So there is no such thing as true decentralization in the way that I hear people talking about it.
[02:02:06.520 --> 02:02:09.160]   Somebody is still making decisions. There's going to be a protocol layer.
[02:02:09.160 --> 02:02:13.960]   That's what you saw with NFTs. If OpenSea delists the NFT, it no longer exists.
[02:02:13.960 --> 02:02:22.280]   Right. So there are entities with control. This is not a control list, totally egalitarian future.
[02:02:22.280 --> 02:02:28.920]   That's not possible. You actually, and I know this was, you wrote this tech trends
[02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:35.480]   before the crypto crash. But I think this chapter is actually great. And there's a lot of interesting
[02:02:35.480 --> 02:02:40.520]   stuff. And so for the people, you know, and I've been very negative about crypto and NFTs and
[02:02:40.520 --> 02:02:46.040]   web three, but that's as it is presenting today. And for people who are curious about what
[02:02:46.040 --> 02:02:52.120]   potential might have in the future, the tech trends report is actually very, very valuable.
[02:02:52.680 --> 02:03:00.760]   And does, and does, I think, bring up some very important. We know the cons brings up the important
[02:03:00.760 --> 02:03:05.480]   pros. How about that? Is that fair? Is there anything you would change six months later?
[02:03:05.480 --> 02:03:11.240]   I actually did not write that part of the report, one of the people who we've got a team that
[02:03:11.240 --> 02:03:21.640]   specializes in that. You know, I, I don't know. I might have, I don't think so. I mean, I think we
[02:03:21.640 --> 02:03:26.680]   might have explored other infrastructure more, but it's a snapshot in a moment of time.
[02:03:26.680 --> 02:03:35.560]   The NFT piece of this doesn't change. Tokens are still a thing. And they matter. I think the
[02:03:35.560 --> 02:03:41.320]   current modality, which is digital collectibles, is ultimately what change is going forward.
[02:03:41.320 --> 02:03:47.800]   They're, you know, I think the sort of FOMO attached to all of that is what drove
[02:03:48.360 --> 02:03:51.640]   the volatility and what also crashed it back down.
[02:03:51.640 --> 02:03:55.960]   Yes. Yeah. That's really my criticism of people who are flogging it.
[02:03:55.960 --> 02:04:01.880]   And really, most of them stand to gain. You know, once you invest in this stuff,
[02:04:01.880 --> 02:04:06.680]   you got to get somebody else to buy it or it's not worth anything. And as it starts to crash,
[02:04:06.680 --> 02:04:11.080]   then you really have to get somebody to buy it. So the drumbeat gets louder and louder.
[02:04:11.080 --> 02:04:16.360]   Yeah, I got to say, Leo, between our earlier conversation about Elon Musk and now bashing
[02:04:16.360 --> 02:04:21.720]   crypto brews and NFTs, I'm assuming we're all going to get a lot of really loving messages on
[02:04:21.720 --> 02:04:27.800]   social media this week. I have good news for you. Those people like, Hey, this was awesome.
[02:04:27.800 --> 02:04:34.040]   Thank you so much for this show. Here's the good news. By now, those people are a band and
[02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:38.200]   ship. They're not listening to our shows anymore. They are hate listening to us.
[02:04:38.200 --> 02:04:41.880]   Maybe they're hate listening. You think I hate this thing? Why? I got to.
[02:04:41.880 --> 02:04:45.400]   Well, how about this? I'm glad I'm off. I'm glad I'm taking my break.
[02:04:45.400 --> 02:04:50.120]   Don't answer any email or don't visit Twitter and be careful what your @ replies say.
[02:04:50.120 --> 02:04:55.560]   Close your DMS. At least you'll be able to get Starlink on your yacht for
[02:04:55.560 --> 02:05:00.440]   mere $5,000 a month. Yeah, and you can listen to hauling oats.
[02:05:00.440 --> 02:05:02.440]   On your yacht, Rod.
[02:05:02.440 --> 02:05:12.680]   Starlink. So I, here's another example of me being a complete wide-eyed optimist, Pollyanna,
[02:05:13.480 --> 02:05:18.200]   now faced with the facts. I thought Starlink was going to bring internet access to every corner
[02:05:18.200 --> 02:05:23.800]   of the globe who's going to transform the world by making internet access widely available at a
[02:05:23.800 --> 02:05:32.920]   low cost. I guess Elon had a different plan. Are you feeling sad for all the yacht owners that
[02:05:32.920 --> 02:05:41.000]   their internet is going to cost $5,000 a month? Are you upset that it's not free for the yacht
[02:05:41.000 --> 02:05:48.200]   people? I mean, I would be thrilled if Elon would then take that money and then offer Starlink for
[02:05:48.200 --> 02:05:55.480]   free in areas where people are underserved. I don't see him doing that. Well, all of Roger,
[02:05:55.480 --> 02:06:01.880]   like Canada is completely off-line as we speak. So Starlink exists there. Maybe he can flip a switch
[02:06:01.880 --> 02:06:06.520]   and be this elevation that the Canucks need. I have to say he has come through
[02:06:09.000 --> 02:06:14.840]   in a number of places where it's been incredibly valuable to have Starlink. The fires when we had
[02:06:14.840 --> 02:06:22.040]   the wildfires up here, where was it? Haiti that he offered is Starlink. So Ukraine. Ukraine.
[02:06:22.040 --> 02:06:27.640]   Ukraine. Yes. Ukraine. He's put in terminals. So let's encourage Elon. I take everything back.
[02:06:27.640 --> 02:06:36.760]   It's fine. Make $5,000 a month off every yacht in the ocean as long as you provide terminals for
[02:06:36.760 --> 02:06:42.680]   low cost in areas that are underserved. That would be good. I mean, it's 5,000 a month after you spend
[02:06:42.680 --> 02:06:48.120]   10,000 on the hardware. Oh. That's not the first there. You're going to buy the upfront hardware for
[02:06:48.120 --> 02:06:53.400]   10,000 and then it's 5,000. You know, I'm just bitter because I was really looking forward to a day
[02:06:53.400 --> 02:06:59.320]   where I could live on a boat and do this show and I ain't going to. Didn't Starlink also just
[02:06:59.320 --> 02:07:05.000]   release a version aimed at RV owners? Yeah. Yeah. So there much is that. How much is that?
[02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:08.360]   I don't know. Initially, the idea of Starlink was you had to have a fixed address.
[02:07:08.360 --> 02:07:14.040]   But they always promised that at some point they would be able to do it in mobile environments.
[02:07:14.040 --> 02:07:21.960]   Let me look. Starlink for RVs. Let's see how much it costs right now. $600. We're the hardware.
[02:07:21.960 --> 02:07:31.000]   And then 135 bucks a month. So it's a little more expensive than land-based non-mobile Starlink,
[02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:36.520]   which by the way, whose price has gone up, it is now $110 a month. But for an extra $25,
[02:07:36.520 --> 02:07:41.240]   you could be driving around in your RV. I think there's a market for that.
[02:07:41.240 --> 02:07:49.400]   That's not a bad price actually. No. And it's pretty fast. Although people with Starlink who've been
[02:07:49.400 --> 02:07:55.080]   owners for a long time are saying that while the price is going up, the speeds are going down,
[02:07:55.080 --> 02:07:58.040]   I guess, as more people are using it. Of course, they're launching more satellites and launching
[02:07:58.040 --> 02:08:02.120]   satellites tonight in a couple of hours. They're going to launch some satellites.
[02:08:02.120 --> 02:08:12.200]   Starlink on your yacht. So hot. Right. Techcratch. Thank you, Andrew Mendes, for that headline.
[02:08:12.200 --> 02:08:22.600]   Let's see. The Mac studio shows the power of the M1 chips, but is not for mere mortals,
[02:08:22.600 --> 02:08:27.720]   says Dwight Silverman. I love my Mac studio, but you're right. It was a little expensive.
[02:08:28.680 --> 02:08:34.440]   Yeah, I got an email from a friend of mine who, after reading this, who had just bought one,
[02:08:34.440 --> 02:08:42.440]   and he kind of, he almost gave me a spreadsheet, amortizing it out over time, how much he says.
[02:08:42.440 --> 02:08:48.920]   He's 68. It's the last machine he'll buy, and so it was worth it to him. I look at it and
[02:08:51.960 --> 02:08:58.440]   it was a really impressive system, and it certainly is fast. And if you're a creative,
[02:08:58.440 --> 02:09:05.400]   and if you're rendering video or creating animation or doing something where you really need that
[02:09:05.400 --> 02:09:14.920]   power, it's a great machine. But just for everyday use, for the way most people use a Mac,
[02:09:14.920 --> 02:09:21.160]   it's probably way overkill. What's really interesting, I thought, when they launched this,
[02:09:21.160 --> 02:09:25.560]   and they still haven't done it, is they have not really updated the Mac Mini,
[02:09:25.560 --> 02:09:35.000]   which I think is eventually is coming, but it will be the machine I'd be even more interested in,
[02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:43.400]   particularly if they do a lot of the ports on the back end. I have a 20, 27-inch iMac,
[02:09:43.400 --> 02:09:48.360]   the last Intel iMac. Oh, it's time to get rid of those. That's right. Oh, I love it. You love it.
[02:09:48.360 --> 02:09:55.480]   Wait. Yes. Yes. And I couldn't. I mean, just doing stuff day to day, I can't tell any
[02:09:55.480 --> 02:10:02.680]   difference between the Mac studio and this machine. And I like an all-in-one better kind of the side,
[02:10:02.680 --> 02:10:08.520]   the bulk of the Mac studio on my desk was kind of annoying when you used to it all in one.
[02:10:08.520 --> 02:10:16.680]   I'm really hoping for a 27-inch. There is a rumor of an iMac Pro coming around the corner.
[02:10:16.680 --> 02:10:21.800]   Yeah, I'll spend for that. I think that's the secret that nobody in no tech reviewer really wants to
[02:10:21.800 --> 02:10:27.480]   admit, which is most users can't tell a difference between any of this stuff. All of the differences
[02:10:27.480 --> 02:10:35.320]   are in benchmarks. You can tell the difference in price. Yes. And Apple has a really good opportunity
[02:10:35.320 --> 02:10:43.160]   for gaming here that either they're blowing or they can't convince developers to jump on it
[02:10:43.160 --> 02:10:51.960]   quickly enough. But these machines would be great for high-end AAA gaming and you just not seeing it.
[02:10:51.960 --> 02:10:57.560]   Yeah. Because Apple has kind of... Yeah, they have to... They've now abandoned Nvidia and Radeon
[02:10:57.560 --> 02:11:02.280]   cards, so they have to provide the GPU that'll do it. Developers don't want to learn a new...
[02:11:02.280 --> 02:11:07.080]   You know, have to start writing the metal instead of DirectX or whatever they're using Open GL.
[02:11:07.960 --> 02:11:13.800]   I think Apple has gone its own way. They've taken that fork in the road.
[02:11:13.800 --> 02:11:17.800]   And it's going to be up to them to get game developers to follow. But I think that's the first...
[02:11:17.800 --> 02:11:21.640]   Well, and they do have game developers working on iOS games.
[02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:24.040]   Casual games. You bet they own it. They own the box.
[02:11:24.040 --> 02:11:31.560]   And there are some really good 3D games and action games for the iPhone and the iPad.
[02:11:31.560 --> 02:11:39.080]   And those... You know, try porting those over to an M1 chip and see what happens. I think
[02:11:39.080 --> 02:11:41.880]   if you had a hit there, that could be really interesting.
[02:11:41.880 --> 02:11:46.040]   We will, of course, talk about this on MacBrick Weekly on Tuesday with our brand new
[02:11:46.040 --> 02:11:52.840]   panel member. I'll let you tune in Tuesday to meet that person. But there have been some criticisms
[02:11:52.840 --> 02:12:01.320]   of Apple's latest chip, the M2. On Friday, orders began for the MacBook Air based on the M2 chip
[02:12:01.320 --> 02:12:07.240]   a redesign in four colors. And almost immediately, the ship dates went out a month.
[02:12:07.240 --> 02:12:13.000]   I'm sure they're out even farther now. Which means probably Apple's just subject to the
[02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:17.080]   same supply chain issues that every other PC manufacturer is subject to finally.
[02:12:17.080 --> 02:12:24.920]   But there have been some complaints about the heat problems with the M2. So it'll be interesting
[02:12:24.920 --> 02:12:30.840]   to see as more and more of these M2 based computers, the MacBook Pro 13-inch and the MacBook Air.
[02:12:31.400 --> 02:12:36.520]   Come out, help people respond to that. But we'll talk more about that on Tuesday.
[02:12:36.520 --> 02:12:43.720]   Apple is in the very active bidding. They added Friday night baseball. They're in very active bidding
[02:12:43.720 --> 02:12:52.280]   to get NFL Sunday ticket. The Kamesh... Is this still Roger Goodell says, "We'll know." Yeah, Roger
[02:12:52.280 --> 02:13:01.160]   Goodell. He says, "We'll know by this fall of the fate of NFL's Sunday ticket. But he does say,
[02:13:01.160 --> 02:13:06.760]   I really believe we'll be moving to a streaming service." In other words, away.
[02:13:06.760 --> 02:13:16.440]   So that is hard to over describe how devastating this is to broadcast media.
[02:13:16.440 --> 02:13:23.560]   No kidding. So we have worked with and advised some of the networks.
[02:13:23.560 --> 02:13:32.600]   And the amount of money that this brings in, these are long contracts. So the talk about not
[02:13:32.600 --> 02:13:37.880]   being willing to confront your cherished beliefs. A couple of years ago, we said, "Hey, what if
[02:13:37.880 --> 02:13:43.800]   a streamer wins out during the next contract renegotiation?" And just like none of them would
[02:13:43.800 --> 02:13:49.400]   hear of it. It wasn't just incomprehensible. It was like silly... It's conceivable.
[02:13:49.400 --> 02:13:59.560]   Right. The devastation that this is going to result in for networks is like there's no way to
[02:13:59.560 --> 02:14:08.360]   sugarcoat it. It's really an interesting way for Apple to become a player here. Reports are that
[02:14:08.360 --> 02:14:14.840]   it's $2 billion a year. Direct TV... They're going to overpay. They're going to overpay. Direct TV
[02:14:14.840 --> 02:14:21.080]   bought it some years ago for $1.5 billion. Sunday tickets important because aside from
[02:14:21.080 --> 02:14:26.600]   the games you can see on your local markets and your local broadcasts, if you want to see any
[02:14:26.600 --> 02:14:32.200]   other games, you need Sunday ticket. So serious football fans, this is a big, big deal.
[02:14:32.200 --> 02:14:36.840]   Right. And what's happening is what used to be scarcity in the market.
[02:14:37.640 --> 02:14:43.560]   Doesn't exist anymore. And so for sports, especially where you kind of want to see the game when it's
[02:14:43.560 --> 02:14:51.560]   on, the amount of money that they're able to make, especially from streamers right now,
[02:14:51.560 --> 02:14:54.440]   which are looking for additional differentiators is insane.
[02:14:54.440 --> 02:15:01.000]   And presumably the NFL at some point will do their own app, right? Major League Baseball.
[02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:06.280]   MLB has a super app. I think you guys know I'm a baseball fan.
[02:15:06.280 --> 02:15:14.280]   It's a Marvel experience. It's as bad as it experiences continuing to sit through nine innings
[02:15:14.280 --> 02:15:19.160]   in the year 2022. So terrible... David, I thought you were a baseball fan.
[02:15:19.160 --> 02:15:22.120]   I am a baseball fan. I took my daughter.
[02:15:22.120 --> 02:15:29.480]   That the game is too... It's too long. It's time to modernize. We probably don't need nine...
[02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:32.760]   I mean, we could have a whole separate conversation.
[02:15:32.760 --> 02:15:36.120]   You know what? I'm with you. I love baseball, but in baseball fans, it's youth,
[02:15:36.120 --> 02:15:43.720]   since childhood. And even I... I just... By the eighth inning, it's like, give me another beer. I can't.
[02:15:43.720 --> 02:15:47.480]   Right. Where's the hot dog? I'm in a coma.
[02:15:47.480 --> 02:15:51.640]   I took my daughter. I was very excited because I grew up with the Cubs. And the Cubs were in
[02:15:51.640 --> 02:15:54.680]   Baltimore, so I went to it. That's the only place you can see the Cubs.
[02:15:57.320 --> 02:15:59.880]   In Baltimore, where literally nobody goes to see the Orioles.
[02:15:59.880 --> 02:16:07.960]   And she was just... She was totally done. Second inning, she was just done.
[02:16:07.960 --> 02:16:16.120]   Anyways. But the app is terrible. Could the NFL make more in a direct-to-consumer play?
[02:16:16.120 --> 02:16:21.240]   Probably. But a lot of that overall revenue is still coming from advertising.
[02:16:22.760 --> 02:16:28.120]   Even Cricket is attempting to modernize and cut the games down from two or three days to a mere
[02:16:28.120 --> 02:16:34.520]   a few hours. Yeah. Our attention span is getting awfully short. I don't know if anybody under 25
[02:16:34.520 --> 02:16:40.360]   has the patience to sit at a nine-inning, three-hour baseball game, especially because football,
[02:16:40.360 --> 02:16:45.960]   even though, honestly, somebody did the math, there's only 11 minutes of action in a three-hour
[02:16:45.960 --> 02:16:52.760]   football game. At least there's action. It's just somehow more exciting. And of course,
[02:16:52.760 --> 02:16:56.680]   the networks are very good at producing it. Amy, have you watched any of the Apple
[02:16:56.680 --> 02:17:03.480]   Friday night baseball broadcasts as a baseball fan? No, I haven't. They're terrible. They're terrible.
[02:17:03.480 --> 02:17:09.400]   They make it even slower, even more boring. Hard to believe.
[02:17:10.120 --> 02:17:15.560]   I grew up in a household where WGN was on constantly. And so that was, you know.
[02:17:15.560 --> 02:17:19.960]   And that was when the Cubs just had lost for decades.
[02:17:19.960 --> 02:17:24.440]   Were terrible like they are right now. They were the worst. They were the worst. But that's it.
[02:17:24.440 --> 02:17:29.720]   A long-suffering cubbies fan. One of the highlights of my baseball
[02:17:29.720 --> 02:17:37.080]   life is going to Wrigley and watching, what's his name, practically fall out of the booth during
[02:17:37.080 --> 02:17:40.440]   the seventh inning stretch. Harry Carey, Terry, Terry.
[02:17:40.440 --> 02:17:46.760]   Terry Carey. May out to the ball. The seventh inning, Harry Carey, six sheets to the wind.
[02:17:46.760 --> 02:17:53.560]   He would lean out the booth and lead the fans in singing it. And every time you looked like he
[02:17:53.560 --> 02:18:00.520]   was going to just fall out. I mean, he was just, "Hey, I want to hear you." Great, Harry Carey.
[02:18:00.520 --> 02:18:07.240]   But that's Chicago baseball. That's a great sport. Kind of nicely. Apples. Apples.
[02:18:07.240 --> 02:18:11.800]   Apples, an answer should just horrible. Oh, they killed him. And if I were the NFL,
[02:18:11.800 --> 02:18:18.600]   that would give me pause. Well, I hope the NFL hires them. I don't think Apple hires them.
[02:18:18.600 --> 02:18:24.040]   I don't know what's going on. You mean MLB hires them? I mean MLB not a... Wouldn't that be funny?
[02:18:24.040 --> 02:18:30.120]   No, MLB, those are MLB employees, I believe. What makes them so bad? I'm curious.
[02:18:30.840 --> 02:18:37.240]   Oh, they're just... I've watched two games and only part of the games. And I wound up turning
[02:18:37.240 --> 02:18:41.720]   the sound off so I didn't have to hear them because they were awful. I just used subtitles.
[02:18:41.720 --> 02:18:48.440]   I watched a couple of Astros games and they talk about themselves more than the game.
[02:18:48.440 --> 02:18:54.680]   Everything is relatable and personable. And I don't want to hear that. I want to hear
[02:18:54.680 --> 02:19:00.120]   details about the players. I don't want to hear backstories. But you don't get that. You get kind
[02:19:00.120 --> 02:19:05.720]   of how they feel about the game. They're doing their thing. Apple, and I guess MLB is trying to
[02:19:05.720 --> 02:19:12.200]   appeal to the millennials. So these are young... There's two women and two guys. They're very young.
[02:19:12.200 --> 02:19:17.080]   By the way, this is very Apple. ESPN on the Mike Flags would have a big,
[02:19:17.080 --> 02:19:20.840]   reledgable ESPN. Can you read what's on these Mike Flags? No.
[02:19:21.880 --> 02:19:26.040]   I have to think that there's an enormous amount of data that went into selecting
[02:19:26.040 --> 02:19:32.120]   the people. Oh, yeah. And I'm sure that... More data than sense. Right. Right. That's the problem.
[02:19:32.120 --> 02:19:38.440]   Listen, if it attracts more young people to the sport, great, because it's effectively going to die.
[02:19:38.440 --> 02:19:43.400]   Otherwise, there's just not enough young people who are... My kid won't watch it.
[02:19:43.400 --> 02:19:50.120]   Sick, how sad. Yeah. Somebody in the IRC says the only way kids watch baseball these days is
[02:19:50.120 --> 02:19:52.840]   they go... They watch the highlights on their Amazon Echo. Yeah.
[02:19:52.840 --> 02:19:59.640]   That's pretty much it. That's pretty much how people watch sports. Everything. Sports, life,
[02:19:59.640 --> 02:20:04.760]   everything. Yeah. I just want the highlights. I don't have time. All right, one more break,
[02:20:04.760 --> 02:20:10.760]   and then we're going to wrap things up. You guys are very patient. My problem is when I've got a
[02:20:10.760 --> 02:20:16.360]   great panel, I just don't want to stop. And you guys are fantastic. Amy Webb, Future Today Institute,
[02:20:17.320 --> 02:20:26.120]   Connie Guillomo, Editor-in-Chief, CNET. E-I-C at C-N-E-T. You go. You go. You got the new logo on there,
[02:20:26.120 --> 02:20:31.560]   out there on the sign. Did you have to revamp all your logoage in your house, too?
[02:20:31.560 --> 02:20:38.360]   Well, that's the only logoage in my house. Yes, we did have to revamp the whole logo.
[02:20:38.360 --> 02:20:44.520]   What's the reaction, Ben? Because I have to say, I worked for CNET when it was Halsey Miner and
[02:20:45.400 --> 02:20:51.640]   Shelby and just a couple of people. He was a guy who came up with that C bar, N-E-T.
[02:20:51.640 --> 02:20:57.080]   This is a big deal redesign at CNET.com. What's the reaction, Ben?
[02:20:57.080 --> 02:21:03.000]   I mean, you have people who love it and people who hate it, but for the most part,
[02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:07.560]   people have liked it because they think it's kind of retro and kind of forward-looking.
[02:21:07.560 --> 02:21:13.480]   Like this when you refresh the page, you're like, "Ooh, cool." They like to see the line go.
[02:21:13.480 --> 02:21:19.240]   That was dating us, I guess. It's still red. It's still, yeah. We didn't change the names.
[02:21:19.240 --> 02:21:23.880]   You know, at first, I'll be honest, I wasn't crazy about it, but I like the clean,
[02:21:23.880 --> 02:21:29.400]   kind of open nature of the page now. It is a lot of, it breathes a little bit more. It's good.
[02:21:29.400 --> 02:21:33.400]   It's very modern, I feel. Well, thank you. What's the name of this font?
[02:21:33.400 --> 02:21:38.840]   Oh, it was created for us. I can't remember what it's called off from my head.
[02:21:38.840 --> 02:21:42.680]   Oh, that. I'll look it up and let you know. The headline font is unique.
[02:21:42.680 --> 02:21:47.880]   You have a helvetica for the-- Many serifs. Yeah, but it's an interesting serif font.
[02:21:47.880 --> 02:21:53.480]   It almost looks like a derivation of the old Rolling Stone font. Oh, maybe.
[02:21:53.480 --> 02:21:59.080]   But I have to turn this off. I'm running an extension called Toucan that translates random
[02:21:59.080 --> 02:22:05.480]   words into Spanish on every web page. So I apologize. Usually I turned it off before the shows.
[02:22:05.480 --> 02:22:12.760]   CNET is not half Spanish now. It's just me. That's just me. Also with us from the Houston Chronicle
[02:22:12.760 --> 02:22:18.840]   and authory.com. Dwight Silverman, great to have you. As always, my dear friend.
[02:22:18.840 --> 02:22:24.200]   Always great to be back. Our show today brought to you by the World Wide Technology. These are
[02:22:24.200 --> 02:22:30.360]   the last-- This was great. The last place Lisa and I went. March 2nd, 2020.
[02:22:33.160 --> 02:22:38.040]   This flu that's going around. It'll be all right. We flew to St. Louis and saw WWT.
[02:22:38.040 --> 02:22:41.320]   And actually, I'm really glad. In fact, as soon as the pandemic lets up,
[02:22:41.320 --> 02:22:46.280]   sometime within the next five, six years, we were going to go back to St. Louis because I want to
[02:22:46.280 --> 02:22:52.200]   visit the Advanced Technology Center. This was the coolest place we saw. Worldwide technology,
[02:22:52.200 --> 02:22:58.280]   they sell enterprise technology. And at the heart of what they do is their Advanced Technology Center,
[02:22:58.280 --> 02:23:03.720]   they started building this a decade ago because, of course, their engineers needed to try new
[02:23:03.720 --> 02:23:09.160]   enterprise technologies. They needed to spin up proofs of concept. They needed to do integration
[02:23:09.160 --> 02:23:14.120]   so that they could advise their clients on what's good, what's bad, what works, what doesn't work,
[02:23:14.120 --> 02:23:21.400]   what works with what you've got. Now the ATC, it's just grown from several buildings now.
[02:23:21.400 --> 02:23:25.800]   It is a research and testing lab that brings together more than half a billion dollars
[02:23:26.520 --> 02:23:34.200]   in enterprise technology from the big OEMs and the little disruptors. It's exactly what you need
[02:23:34.200 --> 02:23:40.200]   if you are adding technology or adding to your technology stack in enterprise.
[02:23:40.200 --> 02:23:45.160]   And here's the best part. You can use it just like those WWT engineers use it.
[02:23:45.160 --> 02:23:52.120]   The ATC offers hundreds of on-demand and schedulable labs featuring solutions that include technologies
[02:23:52.120 --> 02:23:57.080]   represented by the newest advances in cloud and security and networking, primary and secondary
[02:23:57.080 --> 02:24:02.520]   storage data analytics and AI. DevOps is so much more when we're at the ATC. It's just rack after
[02:24:02.520 --> 02:24:06.680]   rack of the coolest, latest stuff all lit up. It's really cool. I asked the engineers,
[02:24:06.680 --> 02:24:11.320]   you love working here. They said, "This is a dream job. We get to work with the latest stuff."
[02:24:11.320 --> 02:24:17.400]   I said, "What's that over there? There was a whole like three racks in a cage completely isolated."
[02:24:17.400 --> 02:24:22.760]   Oh, they said, "That's where we do our AV and ransomware testing." That is completely
[02:24:22.760 --> 02:24:28.840]   isolated from the rest of the building. You have to get special permission to go in there.
[02:24:28.840 --> 02:24:35.000]   But that's how committed they are. They actually built a whole area just so they could try security
[02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:40.200]   solutions. With ATC, you can do the same. You could test out products and solutions before you
[02:24:40.200 --> 02:24:44.840]   go to market. It's not just the labs. It's technical articles, expert insights. They've got
[02:24:44.840 --> 02:24:49.080]   demonstration videos. They've got white papers. All the tools you need to stay up to date with
[02:24:49.080 --> 02:24:55.960]   the latest technology. This is why people, when they start using WWT, they never stop. This is a
[02:24:55.960 --> 02:25:02.520]   trusted partner that's with you. They understand that business is about strategy, not technology,
[02:25:02.520 --> 02:25:07.400]   but technology supports the strategy. They're very clear. They understand that. They come in and
[02:25:07.400 --> 02:25:13.160]   they help you completely fulfill your business purpose by choosing the right technology.
[02:25:13.160 --> 02:25:18.600]   It's strategy first. I think this is so fantastic. I'm so glad they've made this available. You don't
[02:25:18.600 --> 02:25:23.800]   even have to go to St. Louis. It's available anywhere in the world 365 days a year. Why you're
[02:25:23.800 --> 02:25:28.200]   at the website, by the way, check out the events they've got going on. We did a panel. It was so
[02:25:28.200 --> 02:25:34.520]   much fun. When we go back, we'll do another panel. Communities. Loomareska, who does our This Week
[02:25:34.520 --> 02:25:40.040]   in Enterprise Tech, just recently did a panel at WWT. It's a great way to learn about technology
[02:25:40.040 --> 02:25:44.120]   trends here, the latest research and insights from their experts. Whatever your business needs,
[02:25:44.120 --> 02:25:51.080]   WWT worldwide technology can deliver scalable, tried and tested, tailored solutions. They are the
[02:25:51.080 --> 02:25:56.280]   partner you want, the part you need that could bring strategy and execution together to make this

[02:26:09.880 --> 02:26:17.560]   You create that free account. It's all there for you. wwwt.com/twit. We thank these guys. We love
[02:26:17.560 --> 02:26:24.200]   these guys. I can't wait to go out in St. Louis. Have some fried ravioli again. wwwt.com/twit. We
[02:26:24.200 --> 02:26:30.120]   brought Mary Jo Foley last time. I think we're going to have to bring Paul next time. wwwt.com/twit.
[02:26:30.120 --> 02:26:38.760]   Thank you for your support. We had a great week this week on Twit. You know what? Let's take a
[02:26:38.760 --> 02:26:46.040]   look at this little movie we made here. The two tech guys are Leo Laport here and Micah Sargent here.
[02:26:46.040 --> 02:26:50.760]   Micah will be all on his own next week. So please help him. Be kind. All your
[02:26:50.760 --> 02:26:59.000]   printer questions next week with Micah Sargent. Previously on Twit. Mac Break Weekly.
[02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:02.760]   The best advice I can give is the advice we always give. And that is if you buy a new Mac,
[02:27:02.760 --> 02:27:05.960]   put it through everything you're going to do. Put it through the hardest things you're going to do.
[02:27:05.960 --> 02:27:10.680]   And if you have any problems, take it back. Do your workload. Tech News Weekly.
[02:27:10.680 --> 02:27:15.720]   They created a new type of feature for the iPhone, the iPad and the Mac that they call
[02:27:15.720 --> 02:27:22.120]   a lockdown mode. And what it does is it basically puts an extreme security measure on your phone.
[02:27:22.120 --> 02:27:28.200]   They're trying to kind of reduce the tax services, what they call it, that could be used to target
[02:27:28.200 --> 02:27:35.240]   at these individual people. This week in Google. You actually asked the artificial intelligence
[02:27:35.240 --> 02:27:39.880]   GPT-3 to write an op-ed. I asked it to write three things. I asked it to write an op-ed about
[02:27:39.880 --> 02:27:44.520]   moral panic. Then I asked it to write a short story with a hero about moral panic. And then I
[02:27:44.520 --> 02:27:50.200]   asked it to write a blurb for my book about moral panic. Moral panic over the internet is
[02:27:50.200 --> 02:27:55.800]   nothing new. In the early days of the internet people were concerned, quote, "that children would
[02:27:55.800 --> 02:28:00.760]   be exposed to pornography and violence." Twit. It never ends that quote by the way.
[02:28:00.760 --> 02:28:08.920]   That sounds just like Mr. Jarvis. Yeah. Little asiest man in literature. He's just going to let
[02:28:08.920 --> 02:28:14.520]   GPT-3 write everything from now on. That was an interesting piece on Tech News Weekly about lockdown
[02:28:14.520 --> 02:28:20.280]   mode. Ian Share writing for CNET, Apple Lockdown mode, a new level of security for your iPhone.
[02:28:20.280 --> 02:28:25.240]   This is kind of going along the line of what we're talking about and making Apple kind of the
[02:28:25.240 --> 02:28:31.080]   trusted place for all your stuff. I don't know if they expect everyone to use it.
[02:28:31.080 --> 02:28:36.920]   It's really for people who are targeted by things like Pegasus, the NSO groups,
[02:28:36.920 --> 02:28:46.200]   very, very powerful zero-click hack. Any thoughts? What's your thought, Connie, on lockdown mode?
[02:28:47.720 --> 02:28:55.960]   Well, this is Apple really just like you said, trying to own the market for privacy on a device.
[02:28:55.960 --> 02:29:01.400]   And it's been going on for many years. The San Bernardino trial that we mentioned when they
[02:29:01.400 --> 02:29:05.640]   stood up to the government and said we won't share data because we believe in privacy.
[02:29:05.640 --> 02:29:13.160]   That it's been a long, long time coming all this message. Lockdown mode is the extreme. It
[02:29:13.160 --> 02:29:20.680]   prevents you from even hooking up with utilities or peripherals. It really is lockdown mode.
[02:29:20.680 --> 02:29:27.720]   The name says it all right there. But it allows Apple to really put a very strong stake in the
[02:29:27.720 --> 02:29:31.160]   ground that they don't just talk about privacy, that they're doing something about it. And
[02:29:31.160 --> 02:29:37.480]   Lockdown mode is coming in the next version of the mobile operating system for the iPhone,
[02:29:37.480 --> 02:29:40.120]   which is in September iOS 16. Will you turn it on?
[02:29:41.720 --> 02:29:47.800]   I will definitely turn it on to see what it's like. How intrusive it is. If I'm constantly
[02:29:47.800 --> 02:29:55.240]   getting asked to turn it off or I can't do things day to day, then I would evaluate. But sure,
[02:29:55.240 --> 02:29:58.840]   I would definitely turn it on and see what it's like. In fact, it looks like it turns off some of
[02:29:58.840 --> 02:30:03.720]   the things that Apple touts as a convenience feature's ability to share things with your
[02:30:03.720 --> 02:30:10.360]   computer and your phone. So here's what Apple says Lockdown mode will do. Most message attachments
[02:30:11.160 --> 02:30:16.760]   are blocked. Features like link previews are disabled. We know that's a that is probably how
[02:30:16.760 --> 02:30:23.000]   the NSO group got into the phones of the dissidents and the journalists and the bad guys too that
[02:30:23.000 --> 02:30:34.120]   Pegasus was used against. A message is a big open hole. Web technologies like Justin Time
[02:30:34.120 --> 02:30:39.640]   JavaScript compilation are disabled. Google did a study actually of Justin Time JavaScript,
[02:30:39.640 --> 02:30:45.160]   found that most browser security flaws were as a result of JIT compilation of JavaScript.
[02:30:45.160 --> 02:30:51.000]   And I think Google offers on Chrome a way to turn it off, but it sure breaks it. A lot of things.
[02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:57.800]   Incoming invitations and service requests like FaceTime calls are blocked, but only if you've
[02:30:57.800 --> 02:31:02.280]   never called the person before. I would just I will hope that Apple makes this grandd enough
[02:31:02.280 --> 02:31:06.840]   that I could just turn that on. You know, I don't know this person. I don't want to hear from her.
[02:31:06.840 --> 02:31:13.320]   We're all going to be beta testing it. Right. iOS 16 beta is coming out shortly or the public
[02:31:13.320 --> 02:31:19.640]   meeting is coming out. Yeah. Yeah. Very shortly. And so then we'll do all the beta testing for
[02:31:19.640 --> 02:31:25.800]   Apple as usual. Shared albums in photos removed. Again, a feature Apple touts tells people about
[02:31:25.800 --> 02:31:31.800]   it. WWDC. Look, you can share your photos. Any new invitations for shared albums blocked.
[02:31:31.800 --> 02:31:37.240]   Sorry, mom. Any wired connections between your phone and computer or accessory blocked
[02:31:37.240 --> 02:31:43.000]   configuration profiles like the ones for Apple public betas cannot be installed. So
[02:31:43.000 --> 02:31:49.000]   you just said, maybe we could do this in the public beta. I'm thinking as soon as you turn it on,
[02:31:49.000 --> 02:31:56.200]   you can't use the public beta. I don't know. Well, find out. Yeah. And you can update to the
[02:31:56.200 --> 02:32:01.560]   next version. You can't have. Yeah. Right. Your device cannot enroll in mobile device management.
[02:32:01.560 --> 02:32:05.800]   Amy, what's does that mean that like third party testing apps? I'm trying to remember the name of
[02:32:05.800 --> 02:32:11.000]   it. It was test flight test flight flight. That's that's doesn't work anymore. Yeah. Plus,
[02:32:11.000 --> 02:32:17.320]   well, for instance, I use a really great service next DNS. That's a DNS provider,
[02:32:17.320 --> 02:32:23.240]   but also does a lot of malware blocking in order for it to work on an iPhone. I install a profile.
[02:32:23.240 --> 02:32:29.080]   You download the profile. Apple says you want to allow this you do. That's gone.
[02:32:29.880 --> 02:32:34.680]   But those things are inherently dangerous. You have to really know this is from the person who
[02:32:34.680 --> 02:32:39.320]   said and I trust this person. And yeah, I mean, because it's that thing same with the mobile device
[02:32:39.320 --> 02:32:47.000]   management MDM. In fact, remember, one of the parental blocking tools on the Apple store was
[02:32:47.000 --> 02:32:51.080]   gotten trouble because they were using MDM, which is intended for enterprise environments, not for
[02:32:51.080 --> 02:32:56.280]   child protection. They were using MDM and Apple got mad at them, pulled it out,
[02:32:57.080 --> 02:33:03.960]   then put it back said, sorry, it's been controversial. So lockdown mode will be any Apple device that
[02:33:03.960 --> 02:33:11.160]   can run iOS 16 iPad, OS 16 or Ventura. Oh, sounds like you can run it on your desktop too.
[02:33:11.160 --> 02:33:19.960]   I don't think any of your on your Apple Silicon desktop. Yeah, and one, I don't think any of us
[02:33:19.960 --> 02:33:25.800]   are targets of well, maybe you are any actually you should run it. You're probably a target of a
[02:33:25.800 --> 02:33:33.960]   nation state. I'm I don't know. When you go to the Pentagon, they take your phone, right?
[02:33:33.960 --> 02:33:41.080]   Depends on where I go. Sometimes, well, during COVID, I'm not. You can't go anywhere.
[02:33:41.080 --> 02:33:48.360]   So kind of remote, but yeah, if I go to a skiff, there's a little lockbox thing outside the room,
[02:33:48.360 --> 02:33:54.280]   and everybody has to put all their devices into it, which I've always felt uncomfortable about,
[02:33:54.280 --> 02:34:00.200]   because then it's like, well, who else has a key to this? But you know, I don't think I'm
[02:34:00.200 --> 02:34:05.720]   interesting enough for anybody to be truly surveilling in that way. So I don't know. I don't know if
[02:34:05.720 --> 02:34:12.040]   they're just watching your location. They're thinking this this woman has access to this woman
[02:34:12.040 --> 02:34:18.360]   spends a lot of time at Rita's getting softer. The ice cream. That's what they're thinking.
[02:34:18.360 --> 02:34:21.160]   So why is it she heavier?
[02:34:22.120 --> 02:34:24.040]   [laughter]
[02:34:24.040 --> 02:34:27.560]   Let's go to Rita's. As they get your health data. Let's go to Rita's.
[02:34:27.560 --> 02:34:33.720]   Wasn't there a snack shop inside the Pentagon?
[02:34:33.720 --> 02:34:40.200]   There's actually a whole Pentagon's huge. And there's actually a ton of
[02:34:40.200 --> 02:34:47.720]   restaurants. Food is pretty, pretty bad. There's a dry cleaner. There's everything you need inside
[02:34:47.720 --> 02:34:55.160]   of it. They actually closed it. I remember the story. It was called Cafe Ground Zero.
[02:34:55.160 --> 02:35:02.200]   And it was a little, here's a picture, I think here's a picture of it. Let me see if I can find
[02:35:02.200 --> 02:35:12.840]   it. Here it is. It was a little, oh shoot. The web is crumbling. It was, well, maybe our firewall
[02:35:12.840 --> 02:35:17.880]   is blocking me or not letting me go to archive.defense.gov. But here's a little thumbnail.
[02:35:17.880 --> 02:35:23.240]   Here's a little thumbnail. It was a little snack check, a hot dog stand right in the middle.
[02:35:23.240 --> 02:35:31.480]   And remember the reason they closed it is because satellite images would show US military
[02:35:31.480 --> 02:35:37.480]   officers going in and out of the same time every day. And the Soviets thought it was the most
[02:35:37.480 --> 02:35:45.000]   secret meeting room in the whole Pentagon. So that's a true story. And it's in the center park area
[02:35:45.000 --> 02:35:51.480]   outside, outside the, so like, it's not in the ring. It's not inside the ring. Yes. It is inside.
[02:35:51.480 --> 02:35:55.880]   It is inside. That's why. Yeah. The Soviets said, Oh, whatever this is,
[02:35:55.880 --> 02:36:01.640]   must be there's a bigger picture. This is from WeAreTheMighty.com.
[02:36:03.080 --> 02:36:07.160]   All the officers going there at noon every day must be important.
[02:36:07.160 --> 02:36:16.360]   It is said, get this, the US, the Soviet Union had at least two nuclear missiles pointed at it at all
[02:36:16.360 --> 02:36:26.840]   times. Hot dogs are dangerous. Yeah. Hot dogs can kill you. They can and will kill you.
[02:36:26.840 --> 02:36:31.960]   I'm mad at my wife because she told me the other day that every hot dog I ate takes 30 minutes off
[02:36:31.960 --> 02:36:35.240]   my life. That just spoiled it for me.
[02:36:35.240 --> 02:36:43.880]   Let's see. What else? Anything else we should talk about before we run? Oh, Tuesday. Very exciting.
[02:36:43.880 --> 02:36:52.040]   James Webb, fully unfurled will be. I think they've already sent the pictures back. I think NASA's
[02:36:52.040 --> 02:36:57.640]   just being coy. But that's a live stream. Is it a live stream? It'll be a live. I think it's like
[02:36:57.640 --> 02:37:05.400]   at 10 30. 9 30 R 10 12 30. You're a president. I'm sorry. Seven seven seven 30. I know because I
[02:37:05.400 --> 02:37:11.320]   have to get up really early. We're going to stream it. Rod Pylar, a spaceman and I will stream
[02:37:11.320 --> 02:37:19.240]   coverage of the NASA event Tuesday 10 30 Eastern seven 30 Pacific with the first images from the
[02:37:19.240 --> 02:37:26.120]   James Webb. Which I just I think it's so cool. I mean, this is like so cool. It's such a there's
[02:37:26.120 --> 02:37:31.160]   so much happening. But this is this is like one of these incredible moments that we're going to be
[02:37:31.160 --> 02:37:38.440]   alive to see this happen. It's literally going to change reality. Yeah. This is actually what I was
[02:37:38.440 --> 02:37:44.200]   saying to Rod this morning is that for all the bad stuff we talk about all the time and I'm kind
[02:37:44.200 --> 02:37:50.280]   of made a pledge to myself to stop to start being putting some more positive stuff. But we are on
[02:37:50.280 --> 02:37:57.640]   some in a very interesting time for science. So the web telescope is so good that it's going to be
[02:37:57.640 --> 02:38:07.000]   able to take the most distant pictures ever taken in the universe so far away that this is light that
[02:38:07.000 --> 02:38:13.720]   is only about 120 120 million years older than the beginning of the universe. We're essentially
[02:38:13.720 --> 02:38:21.480]   going to be able to see the very earliest big bet right after the Big Bang moments of the universe
[02:38:21.480 --> 02:38:26.600]   fascinating. Can't wait. We're going to see that too. And then the the particle accelerator lab at
[02:38:26.600 --> 02:38:36.440]   CERN has just turned on the large Hadron Collider for the third time with even more power than before
[02:38:36.440 --> 02:38:41.800]   in the already finding mysterious particles. Although there was some concern I remember on Reddit
[02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:49.400]   among some people that the end of the world was nigh that you know they were going to discover
[02:38:49.400 --> 02:38:54.360]   something that was going to cause the universe to collapse or something. I'm happy to say that
[02:38:54.360 --> 02:39:04.040]   did not happen yet. Oh, for the last three years engineers have been upgrading the colliders so it
[02:39:04.040 --> 02:39:10.440]   could detect more data run at higher speeds. It's running at the highest energy level ever 13.6
[02:39:10.440 --> 02:39:19.400]   trillion electron volts. So we live in yes, Amy, thank you. We live in exciting times.
[02:39:19.400 --> 02:39:28.840]   And I am thrilled to have had this time together with you Amy Webb future today Institute. I feel
[02:39:28.840 --> 02:39:32.840]   like I kind of pressured you into doing this show. I just want to apologize.
[02:39:32.840 --> 02:39:39.320]   Didn't pressure him. I love being here all the time. I really cool people. You're so busy. You
[02:39:39.320 --> 02:39:44.280]   speak in a Russian accent. Yes, it's right. What else would I be the wonderful Amy Webb.
[02:39:44.280 --> 02:39:52.120]   She's great. I've been watching lately the chess tournaments the candidate US I'm sorry the world
[02:39:52.120 --> 02:39:57.800]   fee day chess candidates tournament just ended to pick the next challenger for Magnus Carlson in
[02:39:57.800 --> 02:40:04.040]   next year's world championship match. It will be a nipple, nipple, nipple, nichy, the Russian
[02:40:04.040 --> 02:40:09.160]   except he doesn't play under the Russian flag because no one does anymore except he's Russian.
[02:40:09.160 --> 02:40:13.960]   So you know he's Russian, but he has to play under some fake so silly. It's like the Olympic
[02:40:13.960 --> 02:40:19.480]   athletes. They play under some. Oh, he's he's not Russian. He's playing under the fee day flag.
[02:40:19.480 --> 02:40:24.600]   But as a result, I'm seeing a lot of Russian commentators.
[02:40:24.600 --> 02:40:28.600]   And I'm afraid my Russians gotten worse.
[02:40:29.960 --> 02:40:34.040]   That sounds pretty good to me. Well, that's right because you don't speak Russian.
[02:40:34.040 --> 02:40:42.520]   My favorite person to watch is Judith Polgar, who's a very famous greatest woman grandmaster of
[02:40:42.520 --> 02:40:48.760]   all time. She her father was a chess trainer who took her and her sister and forced
[02:40:48.760 --> 02:40:54.280]   to study chess. They're all childhood, but it paid off. She's very good.
[02:40:57.320 --> 02:41:02.840]   Anyway, she has I think she's Hungarian or Polish or something Eastern European. So
[02:41:02.840 --> 02:41:09.560]   her action little X and little different. Thank you, Amy Web. Please come back. I promise not to.
[02:41:09.560 --> 02:41:15.560]   I promise no more pressure, no more DMing you on the Twitter saying, please come on the show, please.
[02:41:15.560 --> 02:41:21.640]   Thank you, Amy. And my regards to Brian, thank you for letting your to your family for letting us
[02:41:21.640 --> 02:41:26.680]   have you for this Sunday evening. Same to you. Connie Goyelmo, she's editor in chief.
[02:41:27.400 --> 02:41:34.360]   Of CNET. Give us something to plug. What's hot and happening on CNET now? Anything new?
[02:41:34.360 --> 02:41:40.200]   Well, we're getting ready to see if Amazon's going to deliver on Prime Day, which is coming up
[02:41:40.200 --> 02:41:45.640]   this week. People looking for deals because everyone is looking for a deal. The economy is bad.
[02:41:45.640 --> 02:41:51.000]   If you if you want a robot vacuum, this might be the week. I forgot to mention it. Prime Day.
[02:41:51.640 --> 02:41:57.160]   Are you like the wire cutter and wired magazine? Everybody all and I remember I'm more used to this.
[02:41:57.160 --> 02:42:00.680]   It's like all hands on deck. They work 24/7 for three days,
[02:42:00.680 --> 02:42:07.640]   rating all the Prime Day. You're going to do that? Yeah, we have a team 24/7 because we have
[02:42:07.640 --> 02:42:14.040]   offices around the world. So well, that's good. We have a we just are doing handoffs from time
[02:42:14.040 --> 02:42:19.880]   zone to time zone. You're already it's already started one minute ago. Amazon Prime Day 2022
[02:42:20.440 --> 02:42:27.160]   best deals so far posted one minute ago at CNET.com. Jared DePaine, he's working. I have to say,
[02:42:27.160 --> 02:42:32.360]   I've already bought my voice activated light bulbs. They were on sale. Oh, nice.
[02:42:32.360 --> 02:42:41.560]   You remember Amazon had these first day gadgets that you could order and then they wouldn't make
[02:42:41.560 --> 02:42:48.520]   them all just the ones that most people ordered. I heard Amazon thermal printer that prints out
[02:42:48.520 --> 02:42:54.600]   sticky notes from my Amazon Echo. I ordered it like a year ago. Finally came the other day.
[02:42:54.600 --> 02:43:00.520]   It's like, wow, look at that. So now I could say, "Madam, hey, print my shopping list." It goes,
[02:43:00.520 --> 02:43:07.560]   I was going to say it's a safe path that anything that Amazon makes is going to be on sale.
[02:43:07.560 --> 02:43:12.840]   I would just hold off and check. Best Prime Day deals. We'll go to CNET.com to get all those
[02:43:13.560 --> 02:43:21.240]   best Prime Day deals. Prime Day begins July 12th, Tuesday. So there's two things to look forward to.
[02:43:21.240 --> 02:43:26.120]   Pictures of these stars at the farthest end of the galaxy and Prime Day deals.
[02:43:26.120 --> 02:43:34.280]   Mr. Dwight Silverman, he tries to retire. Every time he's on, he's trying to retire,
[02:43:34.280 --> 02:43:38.760]   they never do let him. He writes it, of course, the Houston Chronicle. They won't let him go.
[02:43:38.760 --> 02:43:43.160]   They won't let him stop. You can get all of his stuff at authori,
[02:43:43.160 --> 02:43:50.440]   a-u-t-h-o-r-y.com/d-silverman. Is it 30 years of columns there?
[02:43:50.440 --> 02:43:59.640]   It goes back pretty far. It picks up the old cron.com stuff. It picks up the stuff from my old blog.
[02:43:59.640 --> 02:44:05.800]   In fact, when I'm looking for something, I go there and search for it instead of
[02:44:05.800 --> 02:44:12.200]   on the Chronicle's website. By the way, I want to say that I have been on with a lot of panels
[02:44:12.200 --> 02:44:21.400]   and Amy and Connie are my favorites. I really enjoyed this. All of us should get together again
[02:44:21.400 --> 02:44:27.160]   and do this as the same panel. We don't normally do that, but sometimes it clicks
[02:44:27.160 --> 02:44:31.400]   and we go, "Oh, we're going to have them back again." This is definitely one of them. So a good
[02:44:31.400 --> 02:44:36.280]   suggestion. Thank you, Dwight. We'll note that down in my little notebook.
[02:44:36.280 --> 02:44:41.400]   On my EMAX org mode journal, I'll write that right down.
[02:44:41.400 --> 02:44:48.760]   Dwight Silverman, Connie Guillelmo, Amy Webb. Thank you so much. Thanks to all of you for watching.
[02:44:48.760 --> 02:44:53.320]   Be silly for us to sit around and talk. If nobody were watching, we do twit.

[02:46:23.560 --> 02:46:29.800]   could you leave us a five star review? We've been doing this weekend tech since 2005.
[02:46:29.800 --> 02:46:35.240]   We are almost 18 years old now. And there's some people who forgot we even exist. I get this all the
[02:46:35.240 --> 02:46:40.760]   time. We're just Joe Rogan. We're just on Joe Rogan. Leo Laportis, he's still working? Is he still alive?
[02:46:41.320 --> 02:46:47.080]   So leave a five star review. Let the world know this weekend tech is still going strong after 18
[02:46:47.080 --> 02:46:51.640]   years. Thank you everybody. And I hope you come back again next week. Another twit.
[02:46:51.640 --> 02:46:53.640]   It's amazing.
[02:46:53.640 --> 02:46:56.220]   (upbeat music)
[02:46:56.220 --> 02:46:58.800]   (upbeat music)
[02:46:58.800 --> 02:47:01.380]   (upbeat music)
[02:47:01.380 --> 02:47:03.980]   Alright, doin' the twit, baby.
[02:47:03.980 --> 02:47:05.100]   Do as a Twitter.
