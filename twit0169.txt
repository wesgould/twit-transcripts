[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.440]   I'm local.
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.040]   So that means--
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.360]   I just walked to the office.
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.080]   He walked to Twit.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.560]   It was great.
[00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.560]   Wow.
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.640]   So the Twit limo did not pick him up.
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.480]   It wasn't necessary.
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.520]   It was offered.
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.440]   I said, no, I'll just walk.
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.640]   I need the exercise.
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.600]   That's Patrick Norton.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.560]   Long time we haven't seen you.
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.400]   It's good to have you back.
[00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.320]   Thank you, Patrick.
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.960]   It's good to be back.
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.760]   I've been traveling for family deaths
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.280]   and I finished Anithym, so I was underground
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.200]   for a couple of weeks thanks to those two things.
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.480]   I want to get you a review of Anithym
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.160]   in just a second, but before that,
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.920]   let's say hello to the fastest man on the planet,

[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.160]   I'm on the 405 freeway right now.

[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.200]   Yeah, it's just great to have you back, everybody.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.200]   Oh.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.320]   Well, so, uh,
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.320]   gosh, I want to get a review of Anithym,
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.880]   but I want to get a review of the Tesla too.
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.720]   I can't decide.
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.880]   I'll flip a coin.
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.000]   Well, actually, I get the first question.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.120]   Jason, did you get one of the major networks
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.920]   to videotape the unboxing,
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.200]   or is it the delivery of your Tesla?
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.560]   It doesn't come in a box.
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.760]   It should.
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.960]   It doesn't.
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.520]   They prep it at the Tesla dealership in Santa Monica,
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.760]   so they will drop it off to your house, actually,
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.000]   and they sound like a sales rep and stuff like that.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.400]   But I wanted to go to the dealership to get it,
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.760]   so this is exciting.
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.160]   So, did you get an email?
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.680]   How did you find out you were going to finally get?
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.680]   Because it's been how long?
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.680]   I ordered it, I think, two years ago.
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.800]   I have the number 16 car,
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.000]   so the serial number is like 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 6.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Oh, that's not?
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.120]   You can go on my Flickr account,
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.600]   and actually, I took some pictures
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:10.960]   and just sent them up before the show.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.800]   Is that your VIN or--
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.080]   That's the VIN number, yeah.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.160]   So the VIN number ends in like five zeros,
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.000]   and then a 1, 6,
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.120]   making it truly a collector's edition.
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.880]   Is your Flickr stream Calicanis?
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:22.720]   What is the--
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.000]   It's a Jason Calicanis.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.280]   All right, I'm going to go look at those pictures and drool.
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.640]   So yours is number 16.
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.040]   Tesla's claiming they've delivered around 60.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.880]   They've had--
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.720]   Yeah, so--
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.480]   --puzzers on 1,200.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.640]   I can do the math.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.640]   So there are 27 cars called the Founder Series
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.840]   for the investors and the company.
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.840]   Then they started the general production for people who,
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.920]   you know, like lined up in bar cars.
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.560]   So there was 27, and then your number--
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.080]   16 of the next.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.640]   And the cars-- the cars don't go--
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.960]   aren't delivered sequentially.
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.720]   They're delivered at-- because I had the same question,
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.960]   because I was grilling them like, where the hell is my car?
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.680]   And so I had a special custom--
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.840]   well, I don't know if it's custom or whatever.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.640]   I had a-- I got a unique color and unique interior,
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.320]   and I think that added a little bit of time.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.880]   And I also got a special coating for the paint
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.440]   that keeps it from chipping, like a special carbon fiber coating.
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.640]   Did you have to pay extra for the orange?
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.280]   No, the orange is one of the available colors.
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.200]   And that was your choice, huh?
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:30.440]   Wow.
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.000]   It is the best-looking color.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.360]   It's awesome.
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.480]   It looks like a pumpkin.
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.360]   It looks like an electric pumpkin.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.640]   I mean, it's going to look good right now in this season,
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:38.640]   but--
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.920]   Well, it's always this season, actually, in LA.
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:41.520]   It's always summer.
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.560]   That's a good point.
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.560]   But--
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.440]   But is it a mint-clined interior?
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.280]   What was the special interior?
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.360]   It's just this leather interior, but it's two-tone,
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.360]   so it's got black--
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.860]   It's pretty.
[00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:51.360]   It's got black--
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.720]   --seeds and orange on the inside of it.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.360]   It looks like one of those Argentinian viak cases.
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.280]   I'm a little disappointed.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.800]   I was hoping for ostrich skin, or mink, or stingray,
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.920]   some good classic cowboy boot leather.
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.320]   Actually, I like the orange.
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.240]   That's pretty.
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.400]   Look in your Skype window for two other URLs,
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.360]   because there are some photos from my China trip
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.960]   in between the Tesla photos.
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.720]   So I just sent you two photos of the whole car,
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.600]   and also the USB key.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.920]   It comes with the USB key?
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.120]   It comes with the USB key.
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.600]   And the reason it comes with the USB key
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.040]   is because you can download the data from the car
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.760]   and actually send it to Tesla.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.760]   So let's say you were--
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.200]   I don't know, you drove somewhere for the weekend.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.280]   You can't get to the Tesla dealership.
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.320]   Something's wrong.
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.480]   You can upload the data.
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.480]   And I think there's going to be some other uses for it.
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:42.000]   But there's a USB key under the dashboard.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.880]   You're just sticking this test to USB.
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.680]   We saw those, Patrick, before with the little devices
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.200]   that would record the readings on the car's computer,
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.040]   that how fast your kid went and that kind of thing.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.680]   Yeah, I mean, basically it's not IMDB per se,
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.720]   but it's the same basic concept.
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.320]   It'd be great if they had that--
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.760]   With cameras, with high-end cameras,
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.640]   you can pop a smart card in there
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:06.800]   and pull all the settings down.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.240]   So it'd be really good if you could just
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.880]   go from one person's Tesla to another
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.920]   and have it just change all the settings for it.
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:12.920]   You know--
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:13.920]   The seats go automatically.
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:14.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.720]   That's a really good idea.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.520]   But I think there's a lot of opportunity
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.720]   with actually doing hacks to the car and APIs.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.880]   Obviously, you don't want to hack the drive train
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.000]   and stuff like that.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Speak for yourself.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.480]   It's the first thing Patrick does.
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:36.320]   I'm having a Hackaday guys work on a couple hacks
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.320]   for it now that we have it.
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:37.960]   Oh, neat.
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.840]   And one of the hacks is going to be
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.080]   to connect speakers on the outside of the car
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.960]   to the RPMs so that it will make some noise.
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.600]   Because when you drive the car, it literally
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.440]   sounds like the Millennium Falcon, which
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.080]   is what we've been calling it the Falcon.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.240]   It goes--
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.680]   [SOUND OF MOUTH]
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.280]   Oh, wow.
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.960]   Do you think they did that on Perpetus?
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:59.440]   It's the electric motor.
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.000]   No, it's the electric motor sound when they're 11 inches
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.160]   across LEO.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.400]   Now, do you find that you surprise people more often
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.280]   now, like when you're coming up and they're not looking--
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.080]   Oh, they don't even see you.
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:08.640]   No, of course.
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:08.640]   Yeah.
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.680]   You're going to hit a pedestrian in the next month.
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.200]   I know it.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:15.320]   I was talking to somebody outside of our office,
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:17.120]   and I was talking to them, and then I drove off.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.200]   And they said they turned around, and I was gone.
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.000]   Oh, my God.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:20.760]   It was like Batman.
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:21.520]   He was just gone.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.760]   He's gone.
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:23.400]   There's actually--
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:23.400]   There's actually--
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.800]   Next Batman.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.760]   Legislation is actually being proposed
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.040]   that electric cars are going to have
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.040]   to have some kind of associated noise.
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:30.760]   Because--
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:31.400]   They actually--
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.000]   There's a company up here that makes a little thing.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.040]   It goes on a speaker on your electric car
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.560]   that makes electric car sound.
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:38.560]   [SOUND OF MOUTH]
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.680]   It's kind of like your digital camera
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.000]   has to make that little clicking sound.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   You have to have a--
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.560]   I'm going to have that built, but I'm
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.560]   going to put a thing on the dashboard
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.320]   where you can pick what you want it to sound like.
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:49.320]   So, like, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Harley-Dietz.
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:50.320]   Oh, it's a billboard.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.320]   I'd want it to sound like--
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.720]   Like, Sobaba's Pod in Star Wars.
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:55.240]   You know.
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.720]   [SOUND OF MOUTH]
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.720]   I'm actually thinking of making it sound like slave
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.080]   one, Boba Fescar.
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.080]   [LAUGHING]
[00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.720]   I like the Tesla guitar pick it comes with, too.
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:06.240]   That's very nice.
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.560]   Yeah, it comes with a really, like, heavyweight key chain.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.800]   And it's really interesting.
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.920]   Out of 60,000, you get a key chain.
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:13.600]   Is there a T-shirt?
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.160]   That's 100.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.680]   [LAUGHING]
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.480]   The base price is 109 for the car.
[00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:18.440]   I mean, listen, it's expensive.
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.440]   Aw, fuck.
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:20.440]   No, you know what?
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.440]   I'm like what you said.
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.560]   I'm really getting my chops busted about buying this car.
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.080]   I know.
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.200]   And I really like what you said in Twitter about it,
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:28.080]   which is that it's not for you-- it's not
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.840]   about buying an expensive car.
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.760]   It's about forwarding, doing what you can to forward
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:34.120]   electric car development.
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.720]   I think that's really a noble.
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:37.560]   No, I think it's awesome.
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:41.800]   If I had your money and the kid's college education
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:44.000]   was taken care of and all that, I would certainly
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.040]   be glad to spend $110,000 on a car.
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:48.880]   But it's just-- I really want Tesla
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.840]   to get through the financial situation they're in
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.560]   so that they can start building more affordable cars.
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.480]   Yeah, I have to--
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.200]   They're building a coupe, right?
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.560]   They're going to build a four-door.
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.080]   And I actually saw the early--
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.880]   it's not publicly out yet, but I know the CEO of the company.
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:07.320]   And so he showed me the mockups, the clay, life-sized mockups
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:08.040]   of the four-door.
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.160]   And it is gorgeous.
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.560]   I mean, I told them immediately, I want to be the number one
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:11.920]   person.
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:13.800]   I'll put the deposit down now.
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.680]   So I'm trying to angle for getting the first one of those.
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:18.640]   But it's a $60,000 thing.
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.840]   And it looks sort of--
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.760]   gosh, I don't know what I'm allowed to say or not.
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:28.040]   But basically, like an Austin Martin, combined with a Porsche
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:31.920]   and a Maserati, sort of in that vein of a fast-looking
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.400]   four-door car.
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.200]   It's a grand jury in automobile.
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.240]   I can't wait to get one.
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.080]   I'd like to be on that list, too, actually.
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.720]   Well, actually, Leo, I'll talk to him about that,
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:42.920]   because you would actually be a good person to have out there.
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.160]   What is the deposit on?
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:49.440]   I think they make you pay in full for the first one.
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.160]   Leo, are you there?
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:52.720]   Are you OK?
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.680]   Pay in full, and you waited two years.
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:57.320]   Well, somebody gets into the simulator.
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:00.560]   I thought maybe I put $100 bucks down or something.
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:03.080]   You can-- in order to test drive the current Tesla,
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.000]   you have to put down a $5,000 deposit.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.720]   Which is refundable with $100 fee.
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:12.080]   No, I would actually-- just like you,
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.880]   I want to forward the development of electric cars.
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:17.920]   My fear, though, is that in a couple of years,
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.520]   there'll be five different people making electric cars,
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:21.920]   and there may be other models out there.
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.840]   I mean, you think Tesla's going to be the premier electric car
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.440]   for some time?
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.320]   I think they have a massive head start.
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.160]   Whenever you are doing something truly innovative,
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.360]   you basically have to fail a lot, right?
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.680]   Which is sort of, I think, why fail culture on the internet?
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:39.160]   You know--
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.880]   Fail whales and all that, yeah.
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:44.520]   I think fail culture is a testament to innovation.
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.560]   You can't really innovate unless you deal with a lot of BS
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:50.000]   and a lot of pain and a lot of failure.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.240]   And Tesla had a lot of problems, I think, getting the car out.
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.920]   But they solved a lot of problems.
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.520]   And now they've solved them.
[00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:57.320]   I'm impressed.
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.400]   I mean, this is a beautiful looking car.
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.280]   They've delivered so many cars now,
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.560]   and they're delivering-- that's a beef ball from Tokyo.
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:04.120]   OK.
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.240]   Sorry.
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.720]   These are your Chinese and Japanese pieces.
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:09.560]   He's got back to Japan.
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:10.720]   That's my new friend for Japan.
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.000]   Oh, she's here.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:12.840]   She's beautiful, yeah.
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:13.440]   I met her in the--
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.520]   This is all in Jason's Flickr stream,
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:16.360]   if you want to take a look.
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.080]   Yeah, I live the transparent lifestyle.
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:20.560]   So we'll get to your trip to Asia in a bit,
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.240]   because you're just back from that, right?
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.560]   Yeah, I got back yesterday.
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:24.880]   Oh, man.
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.000]   All these people are world travelers.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.720]   The Vorax going to Europe, that's why he's not here today.
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.080]   Ah, yeah, I'm not a parish.
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.080]   Parish.
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.080]   Ah.
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:34.640]   Is he going to-- is he going to the web?
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:35.560]   Oh, I want to do that.
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.240]   That looks-- that's supposed to be a great conference.
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:37.680]   That's Louis.
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:38.200]   It's awesome.
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.200]   I was supposed to speak at it, but I actually can't right now,
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.120]   because we're in the middle of a big deal.
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.680]   I want to-- and Alex, you're leaving for Tokyo tomorrow?
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.640]   No, I'm scheduled for next Saturday.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:48.600]   Next Saturday.
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:49.160]   So, yeah.
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:50.680]   You would love-- OK, have you been?
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:52.680]   I've never been there, but I love sushi.
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.000]   And Patrick, you and I are going
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.640]   to go to the Coney Island hot dog stand down
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:00.040]   at the end of Ocean Street, I think a little later.
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.400]   Actually, I hate to break your heart,
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:05.600]   but I'll be in exotic North Carolina later this week.
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.080]   All right.
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.360]   Where?
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.200]   High point.
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.000]   Greensboro.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.440]   I'll go ahead and see my grandfather.
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:13.880]   Excellent.
[00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:16.160]   You're doing family stuff.
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:17.080]   Family stuff.
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.920]   Well, I'm wearing my Mal cap, because I'm
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:21.720]   getting ready for a trip to China in 2043.
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:23.080]   So I'll be-- no.
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:24.600]   Actually, I'm going to China this summer.
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:26.120]   So maybe I'll catch up with you guys in there.
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:26.960]   Oh, that'll be awesome.
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:27.920]   Passport stamps.
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:28.920]   Are you taking the kids?
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.960]   Take Henry, yeah, just Henry and I.
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:31.960]   That's so cool.
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:32.280]   I know.
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:33.560]   I'm looking forward to that.
[00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:34.640]   That's epic.
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.600]   Yeah, he's a world traveler by now.
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.040]   I hope your children appreciate like--
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.760]   No, no clue at all.
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:41.800]   Abby's in France right now.
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.280]   She's loving it, but no clue.
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.000]   No pre-shipments back to Petaluma.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:46.760]   Not yet.
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.000]   I'm praying for that.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.240]   Oh, we're going to pause for a moment while Alex gets his espresso.
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.280]   Oh, thank you, thank you.
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:53.800]   Hi.
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:54.280]   Jolly good.
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.280]   Jolly good.
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.520]   You come to like espresso.
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:57.520]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.760]   Have a macchiato.
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:02.520]   Let's get some tech news in here before people send me nasty notes.
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.600]   Ah, nasty notes.
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.640]   So in the interesting, Obama's going
[00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:08.640]   to have to give up his BlackBerry.
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.920]   And he's not-- people are not convinced he's going to be able to do it.
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:13.320]   He's apparently quite the addict.
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:16.720]   Any time you see the president-elect in pictures, he's got--
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.400]   in fact, I saw that when he just after he got elected.
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.040]   He and Michelle are coming out of the door there.
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:21.760]   She's got the bouquet.
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:22.720]   He's got his BlackBerry.
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.960]   He's not even looking where he's going.
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:27.480]   He's got his face glued to the BlackBerry the whole time.
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.840]   But apparently, because of something called the Presidential Records
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.600]   Act--
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:36.600]   I didn't know this, but George W. Bush gave up email.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:40.880]   When he became president eight years ago, he actually sent out an email
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:45.720]   to 42 regular correspondence saying,
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:46.560]   given-- let me see.
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.840]   Am I fine with the quote that he sent out to his friends?
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.880]   This is a New York Times article from today's New York Times.
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.840]   Basically, they record everything.
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:00.600]   Yeah, the Presidential Records Act puts all presidential correspondence
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:03.200]   in the public domain, essentially.
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.120]   It's up for public review.
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.520]   It's part of the official record.
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.840]   It can be subpoenaed, Freedom of Information Acted.
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:14.160]   So Bush-- by the way, did you know George Bush's email address
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:20.200]   before he became president was G94B@aol.com?
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.320]   I'm not kidding.
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:22.160]   You think I'm kidding?
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.240]   I'm not kidding.
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:25.600]   He sent out an email saying, since I don't want my private
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.720]   conversations looked at by those out to embarrass,
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:32.640]   the only course of action is not to correspond in cyberspace.
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:33.480]   This saddens me.
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:34.800]   I've enjoyed conversing with each of you.
[00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:37.600]   You set this out to friends that he'd been emailing saying,
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:38.360]   I can't do it now.
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:39.200]   I'm president.
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:40.720]   Now, here we are eight years later.
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.320]   Obama lives on his BlackBerry.
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:45.400]   In fact, according to this story, even his briefing books
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:49.280]   and his speech preparation was sent to him on his BlackBerry.
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:51.800]   They weren't printed out for him.
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.880]   Yeah, but there's no reason he cannot continue
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:56.120]   to use his BlackBerry.
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:57.160]   Read only.
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.480]   Read only.
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:02.640]   Well, or if I understand the law,
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:05.200]   all they have to do is record every message he sends.
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:05.800]   Well, they will.
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.640]   And I guess the-- yeah, OK, you're right.
[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:09.600]   I mean, it's just--
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:13.080]   it's a matter of whether or not he is willing to make--
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:14.720]   I mean, it's basically whether or not he
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.920]   is willing to involve everyone who might communicate with them
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:18.720]   in that fashion.
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:19.720]   I think that's the issue.
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:20.520]   Yeah, but what happens--
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:21.960]   Yeah, but what happens--
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:24.080]   What happens when his ex-girlfriend from college email
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:27.200]   and I was like, hey, remember that night when we got really
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:27.960]   trash and went--
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:28.520]   That's a good point.
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:29.000]   That's not--
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   And then all of a sudden, that's public record, you know?
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.560]   Yeah, but I think in the terms of the two-year election,
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:37.800]   somebody would have taken advantage of that situation.
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.440]   Yeah, no, you're right.
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:42.200]   I mean, he's certainly been heavily vetted.
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:42.760]   I think this--
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.880]   But now you're in-- I mean, people said me emails
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.160]   that I don't want published.
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.960]   Like, I'm like, why are you putting that in email?
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:48.960]   Come on.
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.080]   Like, wow.
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:50.880]   Well, that's a good point.
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.360]   How many of us would want every email message we've ever gotten?
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:54.880]   Well, that's part of the vetting process.
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:56.760]   If you look at-- if you look at the--
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:59.840]   there's like a 63-page questionnaire--
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.520]   Oh, man, this question is there.
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:04.160]   And one of them's, have you ever sent any emails
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.320]   that you would be embarrassed about in the future?
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:07.400]   I'm like, oh, man, well--
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.200]   Worse than that, have you seen this question?
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:10.560]   It is insane.
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.600]   They not only say, have you ever sent,
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.320]   they say, we want copies of every posting you have ever
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.840]   made to the internet.
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:17.240]   They--
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:18.480]   Who's sending this out?
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.600]   If you want to work in the White House, the White House
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.960]   does, to anybody who has applied for a job in the White
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:25.120]   House-- let me see if I could find it, because I think I
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.160]   bookmarked it undelicious.
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:31.440]   If you're applying for a job in the White House,
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:35.200]   there's a seven-page questionnaire in which you're asked--
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:35.680]   here it is.
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:37.520]   It's from a nine-page questionnaire.
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:42.960]   It requires all applicants to list.
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:48.840]   And if possible, provide copies of all, quote, posts or comments
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:51.880]   on blogs or other websites they have ever made.
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:57.240]   Also required, all aliases or nicknames ever used.
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:00.320]   See, what's interesting about that is, does that mean,
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:04.480]   on one hand, I can completely understand the White House.
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:05.680]   And it doesn't-- I don't think it has--
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:07.760]   Is this a democratic thing or a public?
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:08.760]   Obviously, they have to.
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:08.760]   They have to.
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:10.200]   They don't want to be blindsided.
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.920]   They don't want a Myspace page from an aide to suddenly come
[00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:15.280]   out and they're dancing naked on a table.
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:19.600]   This could also be their way of telling people, OK, you can
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:21.680]   send it in and say, like, nothing embarrassing,
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:25.720]   but in the future, don't do anything stupid online.
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:29.440]   But it's an interesting thought.
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.320]   I mean, can you imagine if they vetted it
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:32.520]   and then they can track something?
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:34.920]   I mean, it's just a fascinating, like, let's
[00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:38.840]   see how Luddite's a community we can force ourselves.
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:40.080]   Well, that's the problem.
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:41.280]   As you're saying to the president,
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:43.800]   you can't use any modern technology, which completely
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:44.560]   hobbles him.
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:45.480]   You're saying to his staff--
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:46.440]   Nobody's saying that to the president.
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.440]   You're saying that what you're saying is to the staff,
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:51.280]   the staff has to be able to account for everything they've
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:54.000]   ever done online, which is non-trivial.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:54.640]   Who could do that?
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.000]   I can't do that.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.960]   I think it means if you're like nine--
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.920]   No, all line is promptly doable.
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:00.360]   But--
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:01.320]   19, forget it.
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.320]   19 is when you're at your worst.
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:04.000]   Makes 19 years.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:04.720]   But I mean, I know.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.400]   I mean, here's where most 19-year-olds
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:07.400]   haven't been through--
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.160]   They were shorter paper trail.
[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:10.160]   Yeah.
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.120]   Here's where's what's-- remember, in the Clinton
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.160]   administration, they didn't do a very good job of vetting
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:14.440]   people.
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:15.440]   They had Zoey Baird.
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.160]   They had Lonnie Gignet.
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:21.560]   They had all of these appointments that had all sorts of
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:21.760]   trouble.
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:22.720]   Kimba Wood, remember?
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:26.240]   Because she had illegal alien nannies.
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:26.880]   She had good tattoos.
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:26.880]   Yeah, I know.
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.800]   But the thing is about all this stuff--
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.360]   actually, I know Zoey Baird.
[00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:31.000]   She's brilliant.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:31.720]   She's awesome.
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:32.080]   You would hire her.
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:33.000]   She would have been brilliant.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:33.600]   Absolutely.
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:34.400]   It was incredible.
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:36.080]   And I don't know what the thing with her was.
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.080]   I think maybe she had used a private jet or something
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:38.520]   like that.
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:39.080]   Or I don't know.
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:39.120]   No, no.
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:40.080]   I believe it was--
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.320]   She was also a case of a nanny that they hadn't paid
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.240]   taxes on.
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:43.960]   Give me a break.
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:49.320]   It's like in LA, you just see busloads of illegal immigrants
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:49.960]   stopping.
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:52.920]   Yeah, but that's the point of all of this is--
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:56.200]   Generally speaking, it's a higher standard of behavior
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.320]   from the federal government.
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:58.360]   And here's my question.
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:00.200]   Are we asking too high a standard?
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:01.840]   I'm not talking about Zoey Baird.
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:02.600]   I'm talking about it.
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:05.400]   We're saying you can't use as chief executive the most
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:09.320]   important business in the world, the free world, you can't
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:12.360]   use email because somebody might get a hold of it.
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.640]   You're confusing-- Leo, you're confusing the issues.
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:18.720]   The issue of the president and all of his communication
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:21.120]   being public property is a separate--
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:24.400]   and I think it's important to separate his issue
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:27.640]   with using technology, which in the Bush decided, I don't
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:30.120]   want to deal with whatever mayhem may result in this.
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.720]   I don't want my friends to tell me about--
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:34.880]   I don't want to friend the email me and say, hey, so and
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.040]   so's in the hospital and to have that suddenly turn
[00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:39.240]   into a public debate.
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.480]   But what I think is considerably more interesting
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:45.320]   is vetting the White House staff and the fact that if you
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:49.920]   want to work, there's a level of transparency for anybody
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:53.640]   in government at this point that has never existed before.
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:57.000]   From the relationship between the White House and Congress
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.200]   to the press all the way down to things like this, a 63-page
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.920]   questionnaire.
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:06.280]   But how much of it is because bloggers and 24-hour news
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:07.720]   cycle, we eat our young.
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:10.480]   How much of it is really appropriate and how much of it
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:15.200]   is if you had one Picadillo 40 years ago, their press
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.240]   is going to eat you alive?
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:18.720]   I think the dangerous thing here is that you end up
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.080]   with this lowest common denominator.
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:22.960]   It's the same thing when you go in to be on a jury.
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:26.680]   And you eliminate all the people who can't do this
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:28.000]   or have conflicts there, whatever.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.800]   And you end up with a jury oftentimes that you wouldn't be
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.560]   that excited about being in front of or most people
[00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:34.600]   wouldn't be.
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:38.160]   The issue is that you're most technologically anybody who's
[00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:41.720]   been in tech for a while is going to have posted something
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:45.920]   on the internet that probably might cross where that is.
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:49.080]   Or have definitely sent emails out.
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.800]   I know that I said he knows out.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:53.160]   I've been embarrassed about last week.
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.160]   This isn't a tech issue.
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.840]   The internet is no longer a tech thing.
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:01.280]   Most people I know who are on the internets are not technical.
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.040]   Here's why it's--
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:04.000]   Here's a million of people on Facebook.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.960]   This is no longer a technical issue.
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:06.960]   OK, so we will--
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:08.320]   We're a generation.
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:09.760]   But I mean, think about it.
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:11.360]   There's also an entire generation.
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:14.680]   I mean, was it University of Texas,
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:19.160]   the kid posting the text message from one of his friends
[00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:19.600]   about--
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.120]   What was this drawing on?
[00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:23.840]   Oh, it's hideous.
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.600]   His kid gets a text message from a friend that says,
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:28.880]   we've got a delete expletive in the White House.
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:29.680]   Get your guns.
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:31.640]   We're going hunting.
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:34.280]   It's immediately posted to his Facebook page,
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.600]   or his MySpace page.
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:40.720]   And pretty much 24 hours later, he's out of the football.
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:41.960]   Well, he's also--
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:45.720]   He's basically out of the football program
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.040]   and various and sundry other things.
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.800]   I mean, in some ways, the internet's great,
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:51.480]   because there's a bunch of really stupid people getting
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:53.320]   nailed to the floor by the secret service.
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:54.760]   Yeah, I can't say that's a problem.
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:57.120]   Now, here's what the Times article says.
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:21:59.880]   And now, we will do couple the questionnaire for the White
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.920]   House from what Obama's going to have to do.
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:06.840]   But the article says, a decision has to be made.
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:08.800]   It hasn't been made yet on whether he could become
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:10.160]   the first emailing president.
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:14.000]   But aides said that seemed doubtful.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.800]   He's getting the advice, give up the BlackBerry, Mr. President.
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.280]   They think it's a bad idea.
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:20.040]   Well, and I think that most people in illegal--
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.080]   I mean, his is almost super legal.
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:25.920]   But most lawyers that I know don't like email.
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:28.040]   Like, they don't email very long for the same reason.
[00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:29.680]   They know-- and I think a lot of us
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.160]   who deal with this on a day-to-day basis
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:35.000]   don't forget that email can end up as a legal document.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.720]   It's like writing a letter oftentimes.
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.280]   And I think that a lot of us become very--
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:38.920]   Well, didn't the Bush White House
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:40.840]   try to erase a bunch of email?
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:42.480]   Well, they tried using their personal emails.
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:44.280]   I mean, that was the big thing with Palin too.
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.600]   Well, Sir, Palin was using a personal email
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:46.280]   to get around this.
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:48.280]   And that doesn't work because it doesn't matter.
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:49.600]   Right, technically, yes.
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:50.800]   Well, it's also people don't realize
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.160]   that email lives on servers.
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.160]   It's required to be--
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:57.760]   it's required to be archived.
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:00.400]   It's amazing that people--
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.000]   I mean, I've seen email--
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.600]   I've seen email--
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:06.600]   I've been forwarded questions and email that you just--
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.880]   you don't want-- people send their credit card numbers
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:09.800]   or Social Security numbers.
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:10.760]   Well, presumably--
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:11.320]   Presumably information.
[00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:12.840]   Presumably, the White House counsel's
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.800]   going to sit Obama down and say, look, dude, this
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.080]   is what you may not do.
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:19.800]   And I'm sure he's smart enough to know this already.
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:23.520]   But just in case, let's say he's super circumspect.
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.760]   He's very careful about how he uses his black bear.
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:27.560]   You know, the point out in the article that--
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:30.360]   Gore, when he was vice president towards the end of his term
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:33.600]   as vice president, didn't fact use his blackberry all the time.
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.920]   Of course, vice president is a little different than president.
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:38.720]   If he gets good advice, could he continue to use the blackberry?
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:39.520]   Is it re-enlightening?
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:40.880]   I just think it's hard to--
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:42.920]   I think it's hard to--
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:43.840]   it would be hard to--
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:45.280]   I know it would be hard to--
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:48.000]   The biggest problem is the stuff coming in.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.800]   I mean, because those people don't know that it's
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:50.320]   a little convinced.
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:53.520]   So what they could do is every time you email to his account,
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:54.960]   they could hold that email.
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:56.680]   And they could send you an email that says, your email
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:58.640]   is going to be recorded as part of the permanent record,
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:58.920]   blah, blah, blah.
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:02.360]   Are you sure you want to have this email sent to him?
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:02.840]   That's a good idea.
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:03.560]   Yes or no?
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:05.640]   Then when it goes to him, it could say,
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:09.680]   you've received an email from ex-girlfriend from college.
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:12.000]   Would you like it to be entered into your email box?
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.360]   Yes or no?
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:14.360]   And he could decide--
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:14.840]   Is it true?
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:15.840]   --I want to receive this or not.
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:17.960]   Or he could say, I only want to receive emails
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:20.120]   from these 50 email addresses.
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.680]   This way when-- who is the starlet who was emailing him
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:23.200]   a whole bunch?
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.600]   Scarlett Johansson?
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.000]   I mean, obviously Scarlett Johansson
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:27.600]   is sending him flirtatious emails.
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.560]   Scarlett was hitting on Barack?
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:30.040]   No doubt.
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:30.640]   She said it.
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:32.000]   And that was the big embarrassing thing.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.040]   She said, Scarlett Johansson said that Obama was getting
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:36.160]   back to horror in like a couple of minutes
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.200]   after sending an email.
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.760]   That's where you got to be careful with the black--
[00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.520]   And then all of a sudden it's like, OK, now this guy's
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:42.680]   got his own Marilyn Monroe thing going.
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.600]   Even if it's not true, somebody's
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:46.480]   going to get the statistics and be like, hey, by the way,
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:50.480]   he responded to this head of state within 15 minutes each time.
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:53.240]   He responded to Scarlett Johansson on average in three minutes.
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:54.880]   Whoa, what's up?
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:57.400]   He's taking the time to think about the future of the country
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:00.000]   when he's talking about the head of state.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.200]   Or he just writes back to Scarlett Johansson, hit me later,
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:03.680]   baby.
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.000]   Yeah, like that baby, hit me later.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.400]   Yeah, can I hit you later, baby?
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:12.840]   Somebody should do a fake email box, like obamasemailbox.com,
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:15.760]   and just put like every day a fake email conversation.
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:18.920]   This is really the problem, is that if he does, in fact,
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:21.760]   use email, that's the kind of thing that's going to happen.
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:23.680]   And it'll be very hard to deny it.
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:26.560]   And I think he probably has to forego the whole thing.
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:27.800]   But I think that there is huge opportunities.
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:30.600]   I'm really hoping that he twitters.
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:31.320]   Or someone twitters.
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:32.320]   He's not going to Twitter.
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:33.240]   He is actually.
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:33.840]   I think he is.
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:34.920]   No, I'm not.
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:36.080]   I think he is.
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:38.680]   Do you have any idea how scheduled the president of the United
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:39.280]   States is on?
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:41.880]   I know, but wouldn't it be great if he had a Twitter like--
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.040]   OK, you're right.
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:44.760]   In which case, Twitter would be a perfect way
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:48.200]   to communicate with the nation in between his weekly YouTube
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:49.280]   address, right?
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:52.080]   No, no, but just imagine a Twitter
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:55.040]   like going into meeting with Putin, wish me luck.
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:57.080]   And people would be watching this.
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:25:58.600]   No, he's just kidding.
[00:25:58.600 --> 00:25:59.400]   I'm sorry.
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.480]   He can't take somebody seriously.
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:02.400]   Hold on.
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:03.400]   Hold on, Vladimir.
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:04.840]   I got a tweet.
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:05.840]   I got a tweet.
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:06.840]   Yep.
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:07.800]   He just has to tweet himself.
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:10.280]   But he could say, can we send something to my Twitter
[00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:13.320]   account about this new proposal that we're back in
[00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:14.240]   and that we're fighting?
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:14.760]   I'm kidding.
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:15.240]   I'm sorry.
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.480]   There's something over people to my paper.
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:20.240]   I don't know if I think Twittering is presidential.
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.240]   Maybe that's just a sign that I'm just a little too school.
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:25.320]   Imagine how about we have, like, a God forbid, a terrible
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:27.800]   disaster and he wants to raise money with the Red Cross for
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:28.880]   Katrina victims.
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:31.080]   He goes on national television and--
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:32.840]   But more specifically--
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:34.640]   More specifically, though.
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:36.360]   If he develops a person relationship--
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:36.840]   He develops a person relationship.
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:39.160]   --a thousand people on Twitter rather than addressing the
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:39.560]   three--
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:40.520]   No, he goes on both.
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:41.360]   No, you can both.
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:41.880]   No, you can both.
[00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:42.880]   But--
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:43.880]   If I have 10 million people on Twitter and those 10 million
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:45.960]   people might be the people who actually go do something
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.200]   versus people on TV, like--
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.360]   Well, here's the example.
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:49.160]   Here's the example.
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.640]   There's already an example.
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:54.920]   He got, remember, millions of SMS phone numbers when he said
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:57.360]   we're going to announce the vice president on SMS.
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:00.600]   He used that during the hurricane.
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.320]   They put out a message saying donate to the Red Cross.
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:06.360]   The Red Cross said our site was knocked off the air.
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.200]   We never expected so much result.
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.160]   They got millions of donations.
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:11.720]   So it is an effective tool.
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:12.520]   Now, that's SMS.
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:13.240]   That's not Twitter.
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:15.560]   But you could bet he's going to use those SMS numbers.
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:16.400]   Twitter is SMS.
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:16.960]   That's all we'll say.
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:17.640]   But I think that--
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:18.000]   I think that--
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.200]   I should build a database of every single person in the
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.200]   United States.
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:24.280]   Well, I think you get into a situation where you have--
[00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:25.400]   I don't think it's 100,000.
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:27.440]   I think if he Twittered as president, it would be a
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:28.640]   million, 2 million, 3 million.
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:30.280]   People following him on Twitter.
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:33.040]   And I think that the issue is that he could get people to--
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:33.840]   Because that'll change the name.
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:35.480]   Maybe they do a presidential Twitter.
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:36.640]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:37.800]   You guys are so biased.
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:39.280]   I mean, they're all late.
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:41.000]   Just think about what you guys are saying.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.680]   You're saying that, oh, the fact that he's on the daily show.
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:46.040]   And you're saying Twitter is un-presidential, but the
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:46.800]   daily show isn't?
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:48.040]   Or Letterman isn't?
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:49.240]   I mean, why are you guys so--
[00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:54.120]   There's a difference between campaigning and being the
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:54.960]   president.
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:56.480]   But I think they are so biased.
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:57.760]   I mean, what a bunch of--
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:58.760]   No.
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:27:59.960]   Jason, Jason--
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:01.160]   This is this week's attack.
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:02.160]   Not this week.
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:05.600]   Jason, Jason, stand down and let me finish the sentence for a
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:06.640]   second or second.
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:11.760]   You seem to forget that there's 300 million Americans, most
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:13.640]   of whom are not on Twitter.
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:17.240]   Most Twitter accounts aren't even accurate, or are not
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:18.720]   even like on.
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:21.200]   And it's like, think about for a second.
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:24.080]   Yeah, SMS, cell phone, easy to integrate.
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.000]   I'll give you that one.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.840]   But the reality is, is how many presidents have gone on a--
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:31.640]   or the stewardship, or any other show?
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:35.200]   I mean, it would be groundbreaking for somebody after
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:38.120]   the campaign to return to the television shows while they
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:39.680]   were still in office as the president.
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:43.280]   What would be wrong with him using every tool to reach out
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:45.680]   to the people after he's president?
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:47.160]   How many--
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:47.800]   No, no, no.
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:48.520]   You want to know what it is?
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:51.560]   How many different messaging systems have you screwed around
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:53.040]   with in the last four years, Leo?
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:56.760]   Although the president has better things to do than screw
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:00.680]   around with 32 million Web 2.0 messaging systems.
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:01.320]   That's the most--
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:01.960]   Yeah, it's fairly steep.
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:03.880]   There's nothing more important than him talking to his
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:04.480]   constituents.
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:06.720]   I would take it even a step further.
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:09.720]   The greatest thing the president could do is spend half
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:12.720]   an hour a day composing an email to everybody in the United
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:15.160]   States about what's going on with our country, how to make
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:18.360]   it better, what the issues are, and he could email it and
[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:19.960]   he doesn't have to be the person who distributes it.
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:22.160]   He writes the email or dictates it or works on it with
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:24.280]   somebody and they put five URLs in it.
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:26.520]   These are the things as a country we should be focusing on.
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:28.520]   Obama got a org slash blog.
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:29.440]   I mean, why do you do that?
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:29.920]   It's awesome.
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:31.040]   And the first time it's the most--
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:31.840]   Obama daily is the greatest email.
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:33.080]   It's going to be so cool.
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.080]   The Obama daily email gets spooked.
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:35.840]   Fake email.
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:36.640]   No, I'm just saying.
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:37.720]   I'm just saying there's a reason.
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.920]   You're coming up with every reason of why the president
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:42.840]   can't embrace technology when technology is what got him
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:43.640]   in office.
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:45.720]   So you're saying everything that he did to get in office,
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:46.400]   all the constituents--
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:47.240]   Let me ask you this.
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:47.760]   Let me ask you this.
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:49.240]   Now you want to throw him out the window?
[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:50.360]   Let me ask you this.
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:51.640]   You don't listen to me, Jason.
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:52.160]   Even whoa.
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.600]   Presidential radio address.
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:57.840]   He's doing the standard-- by the way, I don't know any
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:30:00.400]   president-elect ever doing a presidential radio address,
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:01.400]   but that's another story.
[00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:02.400]   No, I have another day.
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.680]   I mean, that started with FDR with the buyer side chat.
[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:06.240]   He was a president, though.
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:06.640]   Right.
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:07.800]   Barack's not the president.
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:10.760]   He's the office of the president-elect, which is made up.
[00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:11.120]   Right.
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.760]   But anyway, we'll leave that.
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.000]   I think it's appropriate in this time for him to communicate.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.200]   He's got to be very careful not to tread on--
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:19.320]   He has himself said there's only one president.
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:19.600]   Right.
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:20.280]   Me.
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:24.720]   But anyway, the question is, is it symbolic that he put that
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:27.680]   on YouTube this week, as well as do the radio address?
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:29.120]   Or is it absolutely--
[00:30:29.120 --> 00:30:29.640]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:30.840]   You don't think it's meaningful?
[00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:32.920]   I think it's meaningful and appropriate.
[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:36.160]   I think embracing the 42 different messaging systems out
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:37.320]   there is a little more difficult.
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:38.120]   Maybe he doesn't do that.
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:39.400]   Maybe he does--
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:41.560]   Well, no, but I mean, I think--
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:42.000]   What if it--
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:43.200]   How about this, Patrick?
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.200]   Change.gov.
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:45.440]   He's already set up this website.
[00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:48.080]   The whole point of the website is transparency.
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:50.520]   We're going to show the American people what we're up to
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:51.680]   during the transition.
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:55.120]   I would hope-- and ask them to respond with their ideas.
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:57.880]   I would hope they'll continue to use this once he's president.
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:58.280]   Right?
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:00.200]   Why doesn't he put up a post there?
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:03.800]   There will be no question about spoofing.
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:05.000]   The other thing, though, is I think
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:07.920]   from a purely cynical political point of view,
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:09.680]   if I was president, I would use stuff like Twitter.
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:11.840]   Because I would develop 3 million people who followed
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:13.920]   that when I said, call your congressman.
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:13.920]   I agree.
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:14.840]   I need to get this thing--
[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:15.340]   It's true.
[00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:16.720]   He's going to do the crush like that.
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:17.360]   It would crush you.
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:18.200]   It would--
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:23.640]   When you go to raise money down the four years from now,
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:25.480]   you'll have a pot that looks unlike--
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:27.080]   Because you've developed a personal relationship
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:29.240]   with 3 million and 4 million-- no, he's already done that.
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:30.200]   But he could turn this--
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.440]   Keep doing it.
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:34.280]   The Obama family could be in the presidency for 16 years
[00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.040]   if they decided that they wanted to go down that path.
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:37.680]   It's what held Malia and Sasha.
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.080]   I mean, maybe--
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:40.080]   Dynasty.
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.040]   It could be--
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:42.440]   No, we're not looking for that.
[00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:43.160]   But what I'm saying is--
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:43.920]   I agree with it.
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:46.280]   It's an incredible power that most politicians haven't
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:48.480]   taken advantage of, and they could take advantage of it.
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:51.320]   And I can guarantee you, in 2012 and 2016,
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:54.240]   from now on any politician who doesn't use these tools,
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:57.120]   as Obama did this year, is not going to stand a chance.
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:58.120]   Not going to stand a chance.
[00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:59.040]   You got to.
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:02.200]   And I think this is actually absolutely true.
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:03.960]   The only thing we're arguing, Patrick,
[00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:06.360]   is what's the appropriate use of it,
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:07.560]   presidentially speaking?
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:12.200]   Well, I guess part of my issue is that--
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:16.160]   I'll officially declare myself the Luddite of the group,
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:19.640]   while I'm sitting literally in front of one, two, three
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:25.360]   computer monitors, two notebooks, and various and sundry GPS
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:28.120]   gear and enough radio to basically follow a truck
[00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:29.120]   for the length of the bottle.
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:29.960]   We believe you're--
[00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:30.800]   We believe you're--
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:31.720]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:34.680]   I'm saying, in the present company,
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:39.080]   I'm officially the latest adopter because I find adopting--
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:41.200]   there's stuff where I go get excited about it,
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:42.040]   and I'll go after it.
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:45.120]   But stuff like web messaging systems and stuff like that.
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:47.040]   Like you and Leo, Jason, you jump on them
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:49.360]   at the drop of a hat, which is great.
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:50.760]   No, we admit we're promiscuous.
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:52.200]   You too, Alex Lindsey.
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:55.640]   And it's for a lot of people, don't have the time to do that.
[00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:57.280]   And it's interesting.
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:00.240]   If we have somebody as part of the White House staff
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:04.240]   whose job is to deal with the 3,200,000 startups that all
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:05.920]   want to carry the president's message,
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:07.760]   or if they can do something where they can add it,
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:10.000]   or make it available and accessible,
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.920]   because you don't want Americans to be like,
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:13.320]   you know what?
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:16.720]   If email, I think it's pretty standard.
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:19.440]   I don't think you can drop off a lot of the older forms
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:20.280]   of communication.
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:22.840]   And I think I just don't want my president,
[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:25.640]   or maybe I want to make sure there's somebody way down
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:28.120]   on the decision tree that has to deal with integrating
[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:31.000]   the 3,200 clerks and other--
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.920]   Well, I don't think you'd do that.
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:35.560]   I'm not saying she used Twitter, although Twitter might be
[00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:38.280]   enough of a de facto tool that he could use it now.
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:41.920]   Yeah, and can you imagine?
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:44.040]   Are we going to be able to get Twitter to scale enough
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:45.680]   to deal with another 10 million users?
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:48.520]   But I think you should use change.gov that way.
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:49.040]   Why don't you--
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:49.600]   I mean, I'm sorry.
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:50.040]   --start that way.
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:51.800]   I think Webstar is a bad stream.
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:53.680]   I think YouTube's fairly mainstream.
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:54.800]   I think it's a great use.
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:55.440]   I just--
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:58.120]   So is it a dignity issue for you, Patrick?
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:33:59.200]   That's what it sounds like.
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:01.440]   You kept saying, "Unpresidential."
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:01.800]   And--
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:06.160]   Well, no, I think I've had some really interesting conversations
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:07.800]   with some relatives of mine.
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:10.160]   Some of them in my own age bracket, or a little younger.
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:11.440]   And some of them older.
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:14.120]   And I've had one of those moments where it's like, yes,
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:16.640]   I've spent most of the last 20 years of my life in beach
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:20.080]   towns or in New York City or San Francisco, where things
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:21.880]   are a little looser.
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:24.080]   And so there's been some interesting conversations.
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:26.440]   Because I remember people reacting to Bill Clinton playing
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:30.120]   sax on, oh my goodness, the Arsenio Hall Show.
[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:33.000]   And people being like, you just kissed his--
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:33.360]   you know what I mean?
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:37.840]   It's like the idea of what the president can do
[00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:39.680]   has certainly broadened.
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:41.640]   And Obama has managed to embrace it.
[00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:43.480]   And certainly, through the way he embraces technology,
[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:45.840]   he has always been very presidential about it.
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:46.680]   You know what I mean?
[00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:48.520]   I'm not looking at my--
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:51.240]   I'm not getting 32 tweets and 22 minutes
[00:34:51.240 --> 00:34:54.040]   and finding out that Obama had cutlets at lunch.
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:54.640]   Which is the first--
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:55.960]   I think he's kind of signaled already,
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:59.000]   because the last post was November 4th election day.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.200]   And it said, get out the vote.
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:02.400]   I think once he got elected, he stopped using Twitter.
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:05.520]   I think he's already said, in effect by his use,
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:06.960]   we're going to go to change.gov.
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:09.440]   They set up that site.
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:12.400]   This is-- follow the transition online.
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:13.360]   He's got a blog.
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:14.160]   He's got a newsroom.
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:16.040]   He's got a agenda.
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:18.120]   They changed it around a little bit.
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:19.480]   They were asking for input.
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:20.400]   They've stopped doing that.
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:22.600]   It may be because they don't feel like, oh, wait a minute.
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:23.960]   Yeah, it's your America.
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:25.640]   Share your ideas.
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:29.520]   I think it's important that the government
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:32.640]   embrace transparency and embrace technology to do it.
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:34.720]   And I just think we're only arguing about the best way
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:35.720]   to do that.
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:39.440]   I guess my question is, I think a lot of the ways--
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:45.720]   because, I mean, Jason, you're the man at embracing new feel.
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:47.000]   I mean, look at your career.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.200]   You're an entrepreneur.
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:49.080]   You're bleeding edge.
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:50.360]   You're embracing new technologies.
[00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:53.040]   You're pushing the boundary of professional communications
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:56.440]   in the sense of publishing and certainly in your own life
[00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:58.520]   from what I've seen in personal communications.
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:01.440]   And there are a lot of people that are way far behind that curve.
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:02.480]   And it's like, I wonder--
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:03.000]   I wonder--
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.440]   I don't think he should be--
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:05.000]   I agree with you.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.040]   He shouldn't be bleeding edge.
[00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:08.520]   He shouldn't be the guy like, wow, let me check out Tumblr.
[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:09.720]   Maybe I should talk to this.
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:12.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:14.080]   Flip that out.
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:15.680]   Maybe I should have put this for a little bit.
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:18.040]   I don't want him screwing around like that or like, oh, you know.
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:20.200]   This looks like a really cool Facebook application.
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:22.120]   Maybe I should start zomping people.
[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:23.120]   Of course.
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:24.240]   But I think--
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:26.080]   Should he have a Facebook page?
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:26.720]   Absolutely.
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:26.920]   He should have.
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:27.960]   My mother has a Facebook page.
[00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:31.040]   Whatever the top 10 websites are, top 20 websites, whatever,
[00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:33.680]   communication things, he should have a presence on each.
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:37.680]   He should have a missive that he does daily or multiple times
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:38.920]   a day, if it's short.
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:42.960]   And he should have a person who is the head of social media
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:44.680]   for the office of the president.
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:45.760]   What would we call that?
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:47.640]   Well, he's already said we're going to have a CTO.
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:47.920]   I presume--
[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:48.840]   Yeah, that's a different thing.
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:49.520]   This is a--
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:52.120]   Well, this is part of his press aid.
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:53.280]   This is part of his--
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:54.320]   It's a press group, right.
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:55.680]   He has more than press, though.
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.040]   Social media secretary.
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:57.880]   Social media secretary.
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:36:58.760]   It still comes.
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:36:59.280]   It's going to--
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:00.640]   It goes under the--
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:01.800]   It gets handed out of the--
[00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:02.320]   It's communication.
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:03.960]   It's a White House communications office.
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:04.600]   You're absolutely right.
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:06.680]   Yeah, so they should have a social media secretary,
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:08.120]   just like they have a press secretary.
[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:09.920]   And the social media secretary should take whatever
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:12.480]   he's working on and put it into these social things
[00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:13.800]   so he can communicate with people.
[00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:15.720]   Because this is where people are living right now.
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:17.560]   So the same way this conversation could have passed--
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:19.560]   This is where many people are living right now.
[00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:20.120]   Well, this is the--
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:20.560]   Go back to--
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:22.760]   People don't spend a lot of time in this area.
[00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:29.000]   Go back to Twit number negative 1,432 in 1970
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.480]   when they were debating should presidents be on TV.
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:34.000]   And that whole discussion is the same discussion
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:34.520]   we're having now.
[00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:36.120]   Instead of going from--
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:38.000]   You're saying this is mainstream media now.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   This is mainstream.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.640]   There's 100 million people going to my space every day
[00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:42.800]   from the United States.
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:45.240]   40 million Americans going to Facebook.
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:46.560]   These are the people, these are the young people,
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:47.600]   the future of our society.
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.400]   That's where they're going to communicate with the president.
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:51.080]   They're not going to watch them on TV.
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:52.880]   They're going to watch them on YouTube and Facebook.
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:53.960]   And that's the eventuality.
[00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:57.000]   So the fact that we as old people--
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.800]   I've read on the phone call is over 30.
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:00.560]   Probably some of us are over 40.
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:02.440]   I'm not saying anybody in particular.
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:05.600]   If Dvorak was here, we'd have somebody over 50.
[00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:08.480]   Yeah, maybe even Shrekshy.
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:11.800]   And the bottom line is we think old.
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:14.960]   And we have to get young people in charge into politics.
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.640]   Because old people are going to be dead soon.
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:18.400]   Well, I think that I think people are going to inherit
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:18.880]   this country.
[00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:20.400]   I think none of this is going to displace
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:21.560]   what you're already going to do.
[00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:23.880]   You're still going to have all the press events.
[00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:25.920]   You're still going to do the traditional media.
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:27.040]   This is all adding to it.
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:29.840]   And I think that the thing is, is in many states where they went
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:31.920]   blue instead of red, a lot of it was
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:35.160]   done by younger Americans who were more technologically astute.
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:36.720]   And pooling those and making sure
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:40.320]   that they stay in your fold from a cynical point of view
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:44.800]   is very, very important, I think, to be successful.
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:48.000]   I guess the real thing is, is this a political thing looking
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:49.960]   forward to the 2012 election?
[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:51.840]   Or is this good government?
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:53.080]   Is this-- I think it can be both.
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:54.840]   I mean, I think that if it's good government,
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:58.160]   it'll be good for 2012 as well.
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:00.360]   I just want to say, somebody, a member of the Twit Army
[00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:03.360]   and the Twit Live at irc.dslashroom.com
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:06.880]   has registered Obama's BlackBerry.
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:09.080]   So get ready.
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:10.760]   If his BlackBerry starts talking--
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:12.160]   you know, I have to say, we're not
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:13.360]   going to do all politics this show,
[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:15.720]   but there are a couple more political stories.
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:20.080]   One is that on Friday, the transition team named,
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:22.880]   I think, two very good choices to head up
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:25.640]   the Federal Communications Commission Review Team, Ken
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:27.680]   Warbach, who I think many people-- like, Evan Warbach,
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:31.040]   who I think many people know, he organizes supernova,
[00:39:31.040 --> 00:39:34.200]   former FCC staffer, he's a professor at Wharton,
[00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:36.880]   and Susan Crawford is a professor at University of Michigan
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:37.400]   Law School.
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:38.800]   And this is what I loved about them.
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:41.520]   I mean, not only is there no question
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:43.800]   that they're going to be promoting net neutrality
[00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:45.680]   from the FCC, but listen.
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:46.880]   Listen to this.
[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:49.160]   Susan Crawford was very outspoken.
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:54.520]   She was at a telecom policy conference in Hollywood in March.
[00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:57.240]   Ambassador Richard Russell, the White House associate director
[00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:59.480]   on science and technology policy, was there.
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:03.760]   She said very bluntly to him, you're living in a fantasy land.
[00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:06.160]   When you say the United States rollout of broadband
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:08.440]   is going well, she said, quote, I
[00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:10.280]   think it's magical thinking to imagine
[00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:12.200]   we're somehow doing fine here.
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:15.520]   And I just want to make sure we recognize that even the ITU
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:18.400]   says that between '99 and 2006, the US
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:22.400]   skipped from third to 20th place in broadband penetration.
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:24.560]   She says, we're not doing it all well for reasons
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:26.600]   that mostly have to do the fact that we failed to have
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:29.800]   a US industrial policy pushing forward--
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:32.720]   this is the thing I'm excited about-- high speed internet
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:34.360]   access penetration.
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:36.200]   There's been completely inadequate competition
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:37.880]   in this country for high speed internet access.
[00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:40.200]   And finally, she said, it's a utility.
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:43.200]   This is like water, electricity, sewage systems,
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:45.200]   something that each and all American
[00:40:45.200 --> 00:40:48.240]   needs to succeed in the modern era.
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:50.520]   Boy, that's got to terrify AT&T and Comcast.
[00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:52.040]   Yes, and it should.
[00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:52.880]   But that's--
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:54.000]   Well, actually, you know what else it
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:54.600]   tellifies?
[00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:59.800]   A lot of startups who are angling to become--
[00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:02.040]   I think probably Jason could address this more.
[00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:05.800]   But the whole-- that runs on some level
[00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:08.160]   so counter to the free market philosophy
[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:11.400]   and the idea that the free market would provide
[00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:12.280]   and that there are options.
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:13.280]   Because like the idea--
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:15.040]   No, no, wait a minute.
[00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:17.320]   I think the free market has failed.
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:18.680]   Exactly Americans.
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:21.280]   Look, if you live in the backwoods of Tennessee
[00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:23.360]   where there are five people per square mile,
[00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:24.880]   there is no one in his right mind
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:27.360]   is going to-- for business reasons, why are you?
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:29.440]   It has to be a government.
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:30.840]   To me, it is exactly like--
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:32.080]   It should be a government--
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:33.000]   It has to.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.400]   This is the same thing that happened
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.840]   with the phone companies here in the United States.
[00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:38.640]   So what happens with rural electrification
[00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:39.640]   and the phone company?
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:42.440]   Monopoly, so they would basically be able to--
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:43.680]   No, this is a pretty easy way to do it.
[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:46.120]   You basically charge everybody who
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:48.960]   is giving internet connection some small amount of money
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.720]   per year for each one.
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:51.480]   And part of that's--
[00:41:51.480 --> 00:41:53.360]   We already do that for rural electrification.
[00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:55.400]   It's like the TVA is what it is.
[00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:58.400]   It's like the rural electrification projects of the '30s
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:01.200]   where we said everybody in this country needs electricity.
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:03.760]   Now, it was good fortune because the depression was going on.
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:05.760]   It was a-- it was like-- it was a works progress
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:07.480]   administration task.
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:08.800]   It was a way of getting jobs.
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:11.880]   We happen to be in another depression any minute now.
[00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:13.760]   Maybe this is the next thing to--
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:14.440]   It's embarrassing.
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:15.800]   I mean, in San Francisco--
[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:16.240]   Please!
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:19.520]   Well, in San Francisco, it's hard to get much past
[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:22.000]   at a reasonable price, much past--
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.720]   what are you getting Patrick?
[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:26.120]   Six megabits a second?
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:26.560]   Sometimes.
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:28.360]   I just have a little better than that,
[00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:31.600]   but it's not a high quality.
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:34.800]   I was told in Japan the hotel room I'm going to has 55 megabits
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:35.640]   down.
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:37.160]   Yeah, everything there has.
[00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:39.360]   They have 100 megabits to your house for like 20 bucks.
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:41.720]   Now, but I don't know what to do with it.
[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:43.640]   Speed is one issue, but look it.
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:47.400]   There are people out there who are on 36K dial-up.
[00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:50.360]   And it's more than 20% or 30% of our population.
[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:53.000]   We need to wire-- we need everybody to get online, at least.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.960]   I don't think it has to be 55 megabits,
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:57.200]   but I think everybody should have a megabit per second
[00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:58.800]   in every home in the country.
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:00.920]   So how are they going to do that?
[00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:02.760]   Because it's an interesting--
[00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:04.800]   obviously, it has to be wireless,
[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:07.080]   which means they have to figure out something better than--
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:08.080]   Wi-max, right?
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:09.920]   You're a big fan of Wi-max.
[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:12.800]   I want to see Wi-max actually roll out in scale.
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:15.480]   And Wi-max, boy, that's a lot of Wi-max towers
[00:43:15.480 --> 00:43:17.640]   to cover Northern Nevada and--
[00:43:17.640 --> 00:43:20.080]   What city has Wi-max down?
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:21.080]   There was somebody--
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:22.080]   Seattle.
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:23.080]   Seattle.
[00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:24.080]   Seattle.
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:25.080]   Seattle.
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:26.080]   How is it going?
[00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:27.080]   This is the problem for me.
[00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:28.440]   Wi-max was originally proposed as a way
[00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:31.160]   to get these rural areas online.
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:33.320]   And instead, it's all happened in Metros.
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:35.320]   No, it was-- it was-- I don't-- well,
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:36.800]   if somebody may have started that way,
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:38.640]   but by the-- at least two or three years ago,
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:39.640]   they were well beyond--
[00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:40.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:42.200]   Two or three years ago, everybody's saying, well,
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:43.200]   but that's what happens.
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:44.880]   They say, well, where's the biggest population density?
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:46.600]   That's where the most money is to be made.
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:48.680]   And then as a result, you get nobody
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:50.840]   wired at all in the rural areas.
[00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:51.840]   Yeah, Wi-max.
[00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:54.160]   But Baltimore has Wi-max, apparently, too.
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:56.680]   So the footprint for a Wi-max tower is not--
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:57.280]   No, I agree.
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:58.680]   We maybe we just need new technology,
[00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:00.120]   but I think we've got to address this.
[00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:01.880]   Anyway, I think it's very encouraging
[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:05.800]   that Susan Crawford and Kevin Wurbeck are now part of this,
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:06.680]   you know, transition.
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:09.280]   And looking at FCC commissioners.
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:12.960]   Do we really want the FCC to be controlling--
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:14.080]   I mean, I just-- Who else?
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:15.760]   --other me, like, FCC regulation?
[00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:18.880]   Well, I just think, like, if the FCC regulates it,
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:23.000]   can they start, you know, putting FCC morality on top of it?
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.160]   No, no, no, separate the morality.
[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:25.280]   No, no, I'm just asking.
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:26.320]   Separate the morality out.
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:28.800]   The FCC are the ones that told the cable companies
[00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.560]   and everybody else, no, we're going
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:32.280]   to preserve the cable monopoly.
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:34.240]   You don't have to share your physical plants
[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:35.400]   with other internet service providers.
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:37.880]   Which makes sense because they paid to bill out
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:38.640]   those physical plants.
[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:41.040]   Well, I'm saying the FCC, this is not an unusual place
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:41.680]   for them to be.
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:42.200]   Do that.
[00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:45.720]   I guess my question is, does the FCC, you know,
[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:48.720]   what does the FCC going to want back in exchange
[00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:49.960]   for network neutrality?
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:52.240]   Or are they actually going to be sort of--
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:53.840]   I think they-- you know, look, they look what they did
[00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:54.520]   with Comcast.
[00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:55.480]   They slapped him on the wrist.
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:58.720]   They said, guys, you cannot filter just bit torrent.
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:01.440]   You have to filter equally across all protocols.
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:03.200]   Comcast didn't get fined, but they stepped back.
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:05.360]   And they said, OK, we'll figure out a better way to do it.
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:07.680]   We'll cap everybody and we'll charge you for tear it
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:09.880]   internet access.
[00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:10.680]   We'll get it one way.
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:12.280]   We'll get our pound of flesh one way or the other.
[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:14.560]   Yeah, that's the bottom line.
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:15.720]   All right, let's take a break.
[00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:16.480]   We're going to come back.
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:17.920]   We have to do some capitalism.
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:20.840]   It is a free market economy still in this nation.
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:21.480]   Thriving.
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:21.920]   I hear it.
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:25.520]   And I just love hearing Jason go.
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:27.160]   Oh, don't tell me.
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:28.080]   This is audible.
[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:29.120]   Does your Tesla--
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:31.200]   Does your Tesla have an iPod connector?
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:34.000]   You know, interestingly enough, it does.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   So you could--
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   Nice.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   If you wanted to, you could hook up--
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.480]   We were talking about theoretically, I could hook up my iPod
[00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:41.120]   with audible audio books and drive the Tesla.
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:42.960]   And because it doesn't have engine noise,
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:45.040]   I could be attuned right into those audio books.
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:49.360]   You could be plugged in as long as the top was up.
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:52.840]   And maybe you would confuse the sound of-- what is it?
[00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:53.480]   A tie-fighter?
[00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:54.720]   What does your car sound like?
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:55.640]   Millennium Falcon.
[00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:56.560]   The Millennium Falcon.
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:59.720]   You might be listening, let's say, to a Star Trek book.
[00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:01.040]   And here the Millennium Falcon--
[00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:01.800]   And confused.
[00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:02.880]   --it's interesting.
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:03.520]   It's right.
[00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:04.600]   I could be actually confused.
[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:07.520]   I could actually go psychotic and start thinking
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:09.560]   on Han Solo because I--
[00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:11.400]   OK, maybe this is a bad idea.
[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:12.840]   OK.
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:14.680]   I wonder if there are Star Wars books on there.
[00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:15.680]   I wonder if there's a Han--
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:17.840]   There's like every Star Wars book ever recorded
[00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:18.880]   is actually on there.
[00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:21.040]   There were a couple of good Star Wars books that came out
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:21.840]   of there.
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:23.600]   Yeah, there were a couple of good ones.
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:25.720]   Do you remember the names I'll look for for you?
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:26.440]   This is interesting.
[00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:29.840]   There's the Han Solo trilogy of all things.
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:31.560]   This is the thing.
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:33.520]   There are some of these that were rated really highly.
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:35.080]   So I've got to go look and see which ones
[00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:36.240]   have the most reviews.
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:40.080]   Well, Audible is like having a giant bookstore or library
[00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:41.040]   on your computer.
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:44.520]   You go there, you search, you find play poker like the pros.
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:45.320]   You might like that.
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:46.200]   Phil Helmets book.
[00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:46.640]   I have it.
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:47.080]   I have it.
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:48.560]   I actually got that from Audible a long time ago.
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:49.160]   But there you go.
[00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:51.440]   There's also Star Wars Legacy of the Force number 5,
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:54.240]   Sacrifice, which has 71 ratings on it.
[00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:55.520]   That's one of the most ratings.
[00:46:55.520 --> 00:46:56.560]   So I may just grab that today.
[00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:57.080]   There you go.
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:58.720]   The ratings-- see, this is-- I love that.
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:01.040]   To me, that's what made Amazon so useful
[00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:02.200]   is the reviews.
[00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:06.160]   And that's one of the things they really do on Audible.com.
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:08.000]   71 ratings, 4.51.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.640]   That's one of the highest ratings I've ever seen for an Audible
[00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:10.840]   book.
[00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:13.200]   So you know it's going to be a good one.
[00:47:13.200 --> 00:47:14.720]   Or the oldest friends are all online.
[00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:16.280]   And there are some of them that have zero.
[00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:20.120]   So now you can just start to say, hey, I'm going to use--
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:22.120]   Oh, you know why they like this one?
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:23.080]   The cover.
[00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:24.520]   It's got to check on the cover.
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:25.240]   Yeah, no doubt.
[00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:26.360]   With a lightsaber.
[00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:29.600]   Were there any women with lightsabers in Star Wars?
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:30.120]   Yes.
[00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:30.840]   Yes.
[00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:32.600]   Who was that?
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:37.160]   In episode one, in the prequels, they were.
[00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:38.840]   Not in the old ones.
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:40.320]   Yeah, but they weren't speaking.
[00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:43.040]   There was that female Jedi who had the things coming out
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:43.600]   of her head.
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:45.320]   And yeah, I forgot her name.
[00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:48.560]   She had the big hair things.
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:49.040]   Yeah.
[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:49.840]   I wonder if this is her.
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:51.720]   Let's listen to a little bit of Star Wars.
[00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:53.440]   Legacy of the Force No. 5.
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:55.960]   On Red Stone, then a vessel made in a shipyard
[00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:58.360]   responded to the Force.
[00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:00.040]   Can't you go faster?
[00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:03.160]   I'll be an old man by the time I get back.
[00:48:03.160 --> 00:48:05.640]   The ship felt instantly annoyed.
[00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:06.840]   Then listened.
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:09.400]   In his mind, the ship spoke in a male voice.
[00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:11.200]   Ever wonder how a ship can feel annoyed?
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:12.760]   Find out.
[00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:14.760]   Star Wars Legacy of the Force No. 5.
[00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:15.720]   Sacrifice.
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:16.880]   You know what they do?
[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:19.600]   Audible has lately been recording a lot of science fiction
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:22.320]   themselves, because many of these sci-fi books never
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:22.800]   get recorded.
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:23.840]   All the Star Wars ones did.
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:26.000]   But a lot of the classics of sci-fi didn't.
[00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.800]   And so Audible has a whole section
[00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:29.360]   they call Audible frontiers of stuff
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:31.600]   that they have on their own recorded,
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:32.680]   because they never got recorded.
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:36.560]   Amazing selection of sci-fi.
[00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:37.400]   Highly recommend.
[00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:39.320]   I want to tell you about the Audible Platinum Plan.
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:42.920]   If you go to audible.com/twitthenumber2--
[00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:44.880]   this is a separate URL for you.
[00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:45.600]   Audible.com.
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:46.160]   Wait, say it again.
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:46.640]   There you go.
[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:48.320]   Audible.com/twit2.
[00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:50.480]   You have a Platinum Plan, I'm sure, Jason.
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:50.920]   Of course.
[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:53.320]   But it says TWIT, the number two slash.
[00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:54.320]   Yeah.
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:54.600]   No, yeah.
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:56.240]   Because here's the deal on this.
[00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:59.800]   If you sign up for a Platinum Plan, which is two books a month,
[00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:01.920]   you get two books right out of the box, two credits right
[00:49:01.920 --> 00:49:02.640]   out of the box.
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:04.560]   You could get Anithym, which is a two credit book.
[00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:07.120]   Or you could get two individual Star Wars books right out
[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:07.560]   of the box.
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:08.120]   Keep them.
[00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:09.960]   They're yours to keep forever, even if you decide not
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:10.800]   to stick around.
[00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:13.560]   Audible.com/twit2.
[00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:14.840]   Anithym, I've got it downloaded.
[00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:15.760]   I've read the book already.
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:17.520]   But I haven't heard the audio book.
[00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:19.240]   So you could cancel after you get the two for free?
[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:19.760]   Yeah.
[00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:19.760]   Yeah.
[00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:20.760]   Nobody ever does.
[00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:22.920]   So well, I mean, you should totally just do it right now.
[00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:23.400]   Yeah.
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:23.960]   Get the two.
[00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:24.000]   There's nothing.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.200]   There's no risk.
[00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:26.200]   There's zero.
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:27.720]   Beyond no risk, you get two for free.
[00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:29.640]   So only an idiot would not go right now
[00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:32.000]   to audible.com/twit2.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   You'd have to be crazy.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:33.960]   I don't want to call anybody in it.
[00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:34.240]   Idiot.
[00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:35.280]   But it's two free books.
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:37.240]   I mean, you would have to be-- OK, crazy.
[00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:38.720]   Crazy, maybe.
[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:41.160]   Crazy not to go to audible.com/twit2.
[00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:42.200]   You'd be crazy not to.
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:43.360]   See, I got my two credits right here.
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:43.800]   Two credits.
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:46.360]   That means I can get a whole lot of so many different books.
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:48.000]   Audible, we thank you so much for their support.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.640]   Audible.com/twit2.
[00:49:49.640 --> 00:49:50.480]   Give them a try.
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:52.000]   You're going to love it.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.400]   Audible.
[00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:54.080]   Get it.
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:54.080]   Audible.
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:54.960]   It's awesome.
[00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:55.460]   Audible.
[00:49:55.460 --> 00:49:55.960]   It's awesome.
[00:49:55.960 --> 00:49:57.560]   I have a jingle in it.
[00:49:57.560 --> 00:49:59.520]   Did you know that I have an audible?
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:00.720]   Have I ever played this for you, Edge?
[00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:01.200]   No.
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:01.880]   There's an audible jingle.
[00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:03.040]   There's an audible jingle.
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:05.840]   I think Jeff Smith recorded this for me here.
[00:50:05.840 --> 00:50:08.800]   Let's just listen to this.
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:10.800]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:12.800]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:14.800]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:16.800]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:18.800]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:20.800]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:22.800]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:24.800]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:25.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:26.800]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:27.800]   Actually, that's Paul Minn-Shall.
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:28.800]   It gets a credit for that.
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:29.800]   Paul is great.
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:30.800]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:31.800]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:32.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:34.200]   I have lots of jingles now.
[00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:36.800]   I have jingles for everything.
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:37.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:37.800 --> 00:50:38.800]   Crazy, man.
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:39.800]   Crazy.
[00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:41.800]   Nobody should make an audible jingle with my voice.
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:42.800]   And that would be fun.
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:43.800]   You should.
[00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:44.800]   Well, they love you.
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:45.800]   Audible.
[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:48.800]   When I went out there in Newark, they said, tell Jason we love him.
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:50.800]   They're really fond of you, Jason.
[00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:53.800]   Well, you know that's mutual because I love Audible.
[00:50:53.800 --> 00:50:55.800]   So let's see here.
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:56.800]   So much love.
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:57.800]   Did you see this?
[00:50:57.800 --> 00:50:58.800]   I'm really happy about this.
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:00.800]   I've always thought that some airline should do it.
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:01.800]   Americans now going to do it.
[00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:05.800]   You will be able to download the boarding pass to your phone or your PDA.
[00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:06.800]   The 3D--
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:07.800]   It's not the barcode.
[00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:08.800]   It's the 3D pass.
[00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:09.800]   It's a 3D scan.
[00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:10.800]   Oh, cool.
[00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:13.800]   I mean, that's what you-- like if you get a Southwest one, that's a 3D.
[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:14.800]   It's not 3D.
[00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:14.800]   They say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they say that they
[00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:21.800]   It's not the lines.
[00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:22.800]   It's the box.
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:23.800]   It says the barcode.
[00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:25.800]   We scan a TSA security check points in America Airlines gates.
[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:27.800]   So now you don't even have to bring that piece of paper with you.
[00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:31.800]   In fact, you can walk up and get the barcode via-- they'll email it to you.
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:33.800]   And then you just walk on.
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:37.800]   It's going to be good at first only at LAX and John Wayne in Orange County.
[00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:38.800]   What?
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:39.800]   What?
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:40.800]   That's--
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:41.800]   Not me, baby.
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:42.800]   That's you, baby.
[00:51:42.800 --> 00:51:43.800]   They did it just for you.
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:46.800]   What airport and airline does Jason use?
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:50.960]   You'll see in Tokyo next week, you can use your mobile phone for like everything.
[00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:57.920]   You go to a-- any convenience store, like 7/11, boom, you swipe your phone, get your stuff.
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:51:58.920]   Everybody does it.
[00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:02.680]   You go to your ATM, you put your phone on the ATM, there's a scanner.
[00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:04.440]   And they have these block barcodes.
[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:05.440]   What are those called?
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:06.440]   The barcodes on the barcodes.
[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:07.440]   Those are the 3D barcodes?
[00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:08.440]   Those are the 3D barcodes.
[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:09.440]   Those are called 3D.
[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:10.440]   Anyway, everybody has those everywhere.
[00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:13.440]   So I took a picture of one of them on a billboard.
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:18.080]   So you hold your iPhone or whatever phone up to the billboard and it launches a URL.
[00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:19.080]   Then--
[00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:20.080]   It's like the Qcat.
[00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:21.080]   It's like the Qcat.
[00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:22.080]   But it's everywhere.
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:25.080]   But instead of having to buy a Qcat, you use your phone.
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:27.120]   Now, where do you get the barcode?
[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:28.120]   I don't know.
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:29.120]   You know what's really sad?
[00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:31.800]   There's some organization that I think you can make them or the software you can make
[00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:32.800]   them.
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:33.800]   You know what's really sad?
[00:52:33.800 --> 00:52:35.760]   You can't do it with the iPhone because it doesn't have focus.
[00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:36.760]   I think people--
[00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:39.840]   You can do it with the G1 on T-Mobile.
[00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:40.840]   But you--
[00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:41.840]   You can do it with the iPhone.
[00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:42.840]   People were doing it with the iPhone over there.
[00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:43.840]   Yeah.
[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:46.560]   But people have them on their business cards.
[00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:47.560]   So you just--
[00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:48.560]   Wow.
[00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:50.360]   So imagine it's so amazing.
[00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:54.400]   And the other thing I saw over there was this virtual-- they call this augmented reality.
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:55.400]   It's a little cube.
[00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:56.400]   I'll give you the URL.
[00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:57.640]   I made a video of it.
[00:52:57.640 --> 00:52:59.480]   But you can see it next week.
[00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:01.000]   But it's a cube.
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:02.360]   And it costs $100 to buy.
[00:53:02.360 --> 00:53:04.160]   You put the cube on your desk.
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:06.000]   You put your webcam on it.
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.360]   And all of a sudden, it films your desk.
[00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:10.440]   And out of the cube comes an avatar.
[00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:12.440]   And then it's a maid.
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:13.440]   And then you interact with your maid.
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:14.440]   And she's like, oh, master.
[00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:16.440]   And then you have a little wand.
[00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:18.080]   Is this some sort of kinky thing?
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:19.080]   It's not kinky at all.
[00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:21.360]   There's nothing sexual about it overtly.
[00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:23.000]   But basically, you give her gifts.
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:24.880]   And you can give her a gift of a cockroach.
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:26.320]   And she gets all scared and runs around.
[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:27.960]   And you give her a gift of a teddy bear.
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:30.160]   And you basically spend $100 buying a cube.
[00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:32.000]   You're buying just weird.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   It's so weird.
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.960]   And then they have this other thing in Tokyo called maid cafes.
[00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:37.720]   Oh, I know about that.
[00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:40.360]   You guys know what cosplay is, COS play.
[00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:42.360]   No, but I know who somebody who does.
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:46.640]   Yeah, cosplay is basically you dress up like anime characters.
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:49.040]   And so people go to this bridge in Tokyo
[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:50.040]   and they dress up like them.
[00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:51.600]   Do they have to get those contact lenses
[00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:52.880]   with the really big pupils?
[00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:53.400]   Absolutely.
[00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:56.120]   And then in-- there's a place called Akihabara.
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:58.480]   And Akihabara is where all the technology stuff is.
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:53:59.480]   You have to go there, Leo.
[00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:00.000]   It's crazy.
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:00.200]   Oh, I know.
[00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:01.200]   I can't wait.
[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:02.160]   It is insane.
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:02.680]   And it's like--
[00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:03.240]   I'm not going to Tokyo.
[00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:06.000]   I'm going to Fukuoka and Nagasaki.
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:07.400]   You have to get to Tokyo at some point.
[00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:09.240]   But anyway, in Akihabara, there
[00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:10.440]   are like 10 story buildings.
[00:54:10.440 --> 00:54:12.480]   And like one of the floors is for cases.
[00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:13.760]   One floor is for motherboards.
[00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:14.200]   Wow.
[00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:15.840]   Anyway, there was a robot.
[00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:17.560]   There was a store that was just robots.
[00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:18.160]   It was crazy.
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:22.520]   But they have these maid cafes where Japanese girls dress up
[00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:23.800]   as maids and then serve your tea.
[00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:25.480]   And there's nothing really sexual about it.
[00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:27.480]   But when you're walking around Akihabara,
[00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:30.080]   there are maids everywhere.
[00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:31.200]   Giving you flyers.
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:33.800]   Like French maids, like short skirts, poofy.
[00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:35.040]   They are French maids.
[00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:36.960]   And then some of them are like French maids.
[00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:39.120]   Tim's street would love this.
[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:40.120]   As cats?
[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:41.880]   A lot of the stuff that goes on in Japan,
[00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:43.120]   that's so pedestrian.
[00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:44.720]   Actually, Colleen, my assistant here,
[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:45.800]   lived in Japan for a year.
[00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:47.880]   And I understand she did a research paper
[00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:48.920]   on those French maid cafes--
[00:54:48.920 --> 00:54:50.560]   or whatever they call them, maid cafes.
[00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:51.480]   Just type maid cafes.
[00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:53.240]   You saw her in the first thing.
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:54.760]   She still has her costume.
[00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:57.760]   Next week, Colleen, do you come in here and your maid costume?
[00:54:57.760 --> 00:54:59.800]   She has pictures of it.
[00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:00.760]   All right.
[00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:02.000]   It's on YouTube.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:05.800]   And in our car, I just put it in the cat.
[00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:07.560]   I'm told our chat room tells me there's
[00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:12.720]   a company in the US called ScanLife.com that
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:16.560]   has an easy code system that they use that
[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:17.600]   is very similar to this.
[00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:20.240]   Problem is, you've got to get widespread adoption
[00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:21.960]   before this works.
[00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:24.080]   But it says, bring your phone to life.
[00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:25.760]   And it's the same system.
[00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:27.560]   I would love to see this take over here.
[00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:29.680]   Do you feel like when you're walking around in Tokyo,
[00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:32.160]   you're walking around in the future?
[00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:33.640]   You do, actually.
[00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:35.560]   Especially when you go to the bathroom
[00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:39.160]   and the toilet seat has nine buttons.
[00:55:39.160 --> 00:55:42.760]   In the future, toilet seats will wash your bum for you.
[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:44.240]   No, they have literally nine buttons.
[00:55:44.240 --> 00:55:45.040]   So I'm looking at this thing.
[00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:46.240]   I'm like, what the hell is this?
[00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:48.680]   So you didn't just press them by random, I hope.
[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:49.600]   Well--
[00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:50.320]   That's the best part.
[00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:51.960]   I sit down.
[00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:53.760]   The thing is, the seat is hot.
[00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:54.920]   Because when you sit on the seat, it
[00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:57.440]   knows you're sitting and it runs hot water through the seat.
[00:55:57.440 --> 00:55:58.680]   So all of a sudden, you're like, oh, this
[00:55:58.680 --> 00:55:59.920]   is kind of comfortable.
[00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:00.800]   So anyway--
[00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:01.520]   Is that comfortable?
[00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:02.520]   I don't even have a hot seat.
[00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:03.240]   It's actually quite nice.
[00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:03.720]   It's quite nice.
[00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:04.320]   But anyway--
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:05.160]   Have you ever sat on a pole?
[00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:06.960]   A pole seat in an outhouse, Leo?
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:07.480]   Yes.
[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:09.600]   It is much better to have a warm toilet seat.
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:11.040]   So I'm looking at this thing, and there's
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:12.600]   a control panel on the side, and there's
[00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:17.040]   a picture of the letter W. And there's water shooting up
[00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:20.080]   into the W. And I'm like, what the heck is that?
[00:56:20.080 --> 00:56:21.680]   So I'm standing up, and I'm looking at it.
[00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:22.840]   So I press the button.
[00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:24.600]   All of a sudden, this little robot arm goes,
[00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:25.360]   [YELLING]
[00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:26.760]   And it comes out.
[00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:28.760]   And I'm like, oh my god, is that going to?
[00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:29.640]   And before I go--
[00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:30.640]   Shoots water.
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:31.640]   [YELLING]
[00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:33.200]   And I'm like, no!
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:35.200]   Literally, this is me, like the matrix.
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:36.200]   I'm like an inch.
[00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:36.720]   Oh my god.
[00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:38.880]   And I'm like, I move my head like, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo,
[00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:40.840]   poo, doo, poo, doo, poo, doo, poo, doo, poo, doo, poo, doo,
[00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:41.200]   and it's up.
[00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:44.200]   Leo, it shot up like eight feet in the air.
[00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:46.680]   It's like the whole hotel room is soaking wet.
[00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:47.680]   No!
[00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:50.080]   And I'm hitting the butt, like, stop, stop!
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:52.520]   You have to be ready for the robot today.
[00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:55.520]   And if you aren't ready, mayhem ensues.
[00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:56.000]   Let me taste it.
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:57.840]   And what's really great is if you get a phone call
[00:56:57.840 --> 00:57:00.120]   from somebody who's just had that happen,
[00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:02.200]   and they have no idea what was going on.
[00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:04.920]   My toilet just squirted at me!
[00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:07.360]   Leo, the best part is there's two settings.
[00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:10.000]   So the first shows like a letter W, curvy,
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:11.960]   which is your butt with water shooting into it.
[00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:12.360]   OK.
[00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:16.840]   The other button shows some weird piece of anatomy
[00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:18.720]   that is for the front, let's say.
[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:21.240]   Is it identifiable or is it obscure?
[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:24.120]   Well, it sort of looks like a little man.
[00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:25.640]   Sort of like a--
[00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:26.120]   Anyway, it--
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:26.840]   Are you saying this is--
[00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:28.560]   There's a we-we-washer button?
[00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:29.960]   There's a we-we-washer button.
[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:32.400]   But I couldn't tell from looking at the icon.
[00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:35.560]   If the icon was made over a--
[00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:37.280]   modeled after a male or female.
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:39.120]   I think it's a hybrid, so it's sort of like this
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:40.240]   hermaphrodite.
[00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:41.880]   It's generic we-we.
[00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:45.240]   It's a generic we-we, but it will clean your we-we as well.
[00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:48.440]   And anyway, this is what you're in for Tokyo.
[00:57:48.440 --> 00:57:49.160]   But if you go, you--
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:49.960]   So, Alex, you're ready for this.
[00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:51.040]   I'm excited.
[00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:51.520]   It's awesome.
[00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:52.720]   Don't get too excited.
[00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:55.880]   You know, evidently Will Smith is a big fan of these toilets.
[00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:57.280]   Does he do a song about it?
[00:57:57.280 --> 00:57:58.640]   No, he didn't do a song about it.
[00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:02.360]   But there's-- I saw this on the web a while ago, but he's very
[00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:04.280]   excited about very--
[00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:05.280]   Wikiwa.
[00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:06.280]   He doesn't want to--
[00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:07.280]   He doesn't want to--
[00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:08.280]   Oh, no, wait.
[00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:09.280]   We're going to walk.
[00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:12.040]   He didn't like to do his business outside of the house
[00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:13.040]   because he had this great--
[00:58:13.040 --> 00:58:13.640]   Wikiwa.
[00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:14.240]   --great washer.
[00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:15.840]   I just posted to the chat--
[00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:17.240]   The chat room.
[00:58:17.240 --> 00:58:21.880]   There's a company in Silicon Valley called Brondell, B-R-O-N-D-E-L-L.
[00:58:21.880 --> 00:58:24.440]   That manufactures Japanese-style toilets at washer dairy--
[00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:25.440]   I see you can get it here.
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:26.280]   Chris.
[00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:27.520]   You can get it here.
[00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:29.760]   And the Brondell was invested in by each other.
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:30.760]   The Cuban.
[00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:32.800]   That's my Cuban body.
[00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:33.800]   Oh, my god.
[00:58:33.800 --> 00:58:35.040]   Mark Cuban has a clean butt.
[00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:35.560]   There it is.
[00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:37.120]   Mark Cuban knows how to live.
[00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:38.640]   I'm looking at the Brondell right now.
[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:39.880]   Well, I don't know what's the video.
[00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:43.720]   Not always, you know, and he's a client.
[00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:45.640]   I am not only a customer.
[00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:48.920]   Can you imagine if Brondell spots his twin?
[00:58:48.920 --> 00:58:52.400]   And can we have our clean butt moment with John de Borac?
[00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:52.920]   I don't know.
[00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:55.240]   It's even better to be like, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:58:55.240 --> 00:58:57.840]   I've never had as clean a crack as I've had.
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:00.880]   She adopted Brondell's auto-buster.
[00:59:00.880 --> 00:59:02.600]   John de Borac for Brondell.
[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:03.600]   Oh, god.
[00:59:03.600 --> 00:59:05.720]   John de Borac for Brondell.
[00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:07.280]   You see, last night I had Mexican.
[00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:09.680]   Now let me tell you.
[00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:12.120]   When John de Borac orders a chimichunga,
[00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:13.400]   the next day is a disaster.
[00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:14.320]   But now with Brondell.
[00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:15.320]   Oh, geez.
[00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:17.160]   He's never coming back on this show again.
[00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:18.720]   You realize that.
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:21.920]   You've just chased him away permanently.
[00:59:21.920 --> 00:59:24.240]   You should see the people in the chat room
[00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:25.240]   going crazy.
[00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:26.240]   They're enjoying this.
[00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:28.400]   I'm going to move on because, well,
[00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:31.560]   moving on, we're all fascinated by toilet culture.
[00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:34.840]   I think perhaps we'll leave that for another show.
[00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:37.200]   I think we have named the show this week in tech.
[00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:39.360]   This is this week in We We Washers.
[00:59:39.360 --> 00:59:40.840]   We We Washers.
[00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:41.840]   This week we go after.
[00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:42.680]   Oh, man.
[00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:43.680]   Well, after, you know what?
[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:45.640]   There's a kind of a theme going on after last week,
[00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:47.440]   but I'm not going to get into it.
[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:53.640]   Uh, be glad, be glad you don't live in Argentina.
[00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:54.640]   Did you see this?
[00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:56.840]   You know who Diego Maradona is, right?
[00:59:56.840 --> 00:59:57.840]   No.
[00:59:57.840 --> 01:00:00.440]   He believes himself to be the successor to Palais,
[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:02.760]   one of the greatest soccer players of all time.
[01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:07.080]   Plays for the Argentine, uh, uh, national team, I presume.
[01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:10.320]   He among many others in Argentina has gone to court
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:16.600]   to sue Yahoo and Google to block all search results on his name.
[01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:17.600]   What?
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:18.600]   What?
[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:22.600]   Not only that, judges, a high-profile judge, Maria Sarvini de
[01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:28.560]   Kubria, many of whom's rulings apparently been questioned in the blogosphere, uh, has
[01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:31.040]   sued saying block my name.
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:32.040]   I don't want any searches.
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:33.280]   Yahoo exceeded.
[01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:37.120]   If you go to Yahoo.com in Argentina and you search for Diego Maradona, the most famous
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:42.120]   soccer player in Argentina, you'll get this message due to a court order requested by
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:43.120]   private parties.
[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:48.000]   We find ourselves obliged to temporarily suspend all or some of the results related to this
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.200]   search.
[01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:51.200]   The only exceptions are major news sites.
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:53.520]   But basically he doesn't want the gossip sites.
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:55.440]   Oh, please.
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:56.440]   That is so lame.
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:57.440]   Okay.
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:58.440]   So here's how we get around this.
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:00:59.440]   What's the guys name again?
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:00.440]   Diego Maradona.
[01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:01.440]   Okay.
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:04.960]   So now if you search for Diego, Diego, like San Diego, right.
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:07.680]   So now switch to D and the M. So you make it me ego?
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:08.680]   Yeah.
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:09.680]   Me, I go Mona.
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:10.680]   Yes.
[01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:12.920]   Anybody who is going to write about this person on the gossip sites will now.
[01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:13.920]   Oh, that was easy.
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:14.920]   His name is Diego Dargana.
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:17.000]   And so now every story should be me.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:23.040]   Diego Dargana, and then if he doesn't, if he blocks that, we'll all switch it to a yoga
[01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:24.040]   a good boy.
[01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:26.760]   And then we'll switch it to Beo go Bea Donna.
[01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:27.760]   What an idiot.
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:29.160]   We could put out a little bullet in every week.
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:30.160]   What is his name this week?
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:32.480]   No, his name is now Diego the donkey.
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:35.000]   Everybody prefer to have a day ago, donkey.
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.360]   No, no, no, this is much better.
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:38.600]   Just let him go off an obscurity.
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:39.600]   Yeah.
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:40.600]   Let him do it.
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:41.600]   Don't work for me.
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:42.600]   Why not be a school?
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:43.600]   Why not for rasping the hell out of him for being an idiot?
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:46.960]   Can you imagine suing to say I don't want you to find any results about me?
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:47.960]   It's nuts.
[01:01:47.960 --> 01:01:48.960]   Google's response to this.
[01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:50.880]   By the way, Google has not yet done it.
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:52.600]   Yahoo said, okay, whatever.
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:54.440]   Google said, no, we're going to fight this.
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:56.760]   Google said, it's completely illogical.
[01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:58.560]   This is a spokesperson for Google Argentina.
[01:01:58.560 --> 01:02:03.560]   It would be like suing the newsstand for what appears in the newspapers itself or demanding
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:07.520]   the newsstand vendor tear out offending pages for the newspapers.
[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:10.640]   The lawsuits should be against the websites for crying out loud.
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:11.640]   Not us.
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:12.640]   Exactly.
[01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:13.640]   Donkey of the week.
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:15.840]   This week's this week in fact, don't believe it.
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:17.840]   Donkey of the week.
[01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:20.440]   Donkey of the week today.
[01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:21.880]   Diego Maradona.
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:24.320]   And now you can't find this podcast in Argentina.
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:25.320]   Bro, T-bot.
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:27.320]   Well, that's a great idea.
[01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:28.320]   That's a great idea.
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:29.320]   That's a great idea.
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:30.320]   The week is a good idea.
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:33.560]   We like to apologize ahead of time for all of our listeners in Argentina.
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:34.880]   This is the last show you'll hear.
[01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:35.880]   You'll ever hear.
[01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:39.000]   And maybe we can get the toilet company to sponsor it or something like that.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000]   Yes.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.000]   Yes.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000]   And related news, Britney Spears has.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.600]   Well, imagine.
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:45.800]   So this is like Britney Spears says, well, I don't like some of the things that you're
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:47.400]   going to do with the gossip sucks.
[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:48.400]   Some.
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:49.400]   Not all.
[01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:52.600]   So what I'm going to do is going to tell Google, look, don't show results that I don't like.
[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:54.240]   Just show results that I approve of.
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:55.880]   But we could just give them a form.
[01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:56.880]   They could go for a couple.
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:03:00.360]   I got a hundred bucks that there's lawyers somewhere within 50 miles of Jason right now
[01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:03.800]   reading this article and going, why didn't we think of this?
[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:09.480]   Well, apparently this is one lawyer in Argentina who has made a living doing this.
[01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:11.200]   He's been doing it for two years.
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:13.880]   Lagizaman is his name.
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:19.520]   He has apparently represented many well-known people in Argentina.
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:25.720]   He says, actors, models, sports personalities and judges.
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:30.760]   Who have apparently sued Yahoo Argentina and Yahoo just says, OK, whatever.
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:34.760]   The problem is it's even easier really, Jason, because according to this article in Time
[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:40.720]   magazine, all you have to do is go to the international version of Yahoo instead of Yahoo.er,
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:42.640]   it is go to Yahoo.us.
[01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:47.960]   And I think the problem that Yahoo Argentina has is that if I was in Argentina, I would
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:50.640]   never go back to the local site again.
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:53.640]   Yeah, I would move on.
[01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:54.640]   Yeah.
[01:03:54.640 --> 01:03:55.640]   Unbelievable.
[01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:56.640]   Unbelievable.
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:59.680]   They're also demanding damages.
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:01.880]   People were able to find information about me in the library.
[01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:02.880]   Horrible.
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:03.880]   Have it closed.
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:04.880]   Sue the library.
[01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:05.880]   Kill the library.
[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:06.880]   Actually, there's a point here.
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:08.880]   Give me a break.
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:10.880]   Was that the morach?
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:11.880]   Who was that?
[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:15.800]   Yeah, anyway, we should give each celebrity a form and then they can decide what's indexed
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:16.800]   in Google.
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:18.040]   It would be called the donkey index.
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:22.960]   They basically can go and like check off like, OK, Britney Spears would like TMZ and
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:26.760]   Perez Hilton to be indexed, but not delisted and galker.
[01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:27.760]   I got another one for you.
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:30.160]   This might be the other donkey of the week.
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:31.160]   Hang on.
[01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:34.080]   Someone needs to send us back in for that.
[01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:35.560]   We need a good one.
[01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:42.520]   Anthony Michaels last year went to a website, noticed an ad from classmate.com saying some
[01:04:42.520 --> 01:04:45.200]   former school chums were trying to contact him.
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:46.600]   Oh, this is awesome.
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:47.600]   Yes.
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:52.480]   He pulled out his wallet upgraded to the premium membership so that he could contact these
[01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:58.560]   long lost classmates, maybe see if his secret crush still liked him.
[01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:00.840]   Once he spent the $15, he learned the shocking truth.
[01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:03.200]   And no one he knew was trying to contact him at all.
[01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:05.200]   He's suing classmates.com.
[01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:11.120]   He said, they were really they weren't looking for me.
[01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:15.920]   Jason, you've created a new feature.
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:16.920]   I love it.
[01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:22.320]   Now, now here's a question, Leo.
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:23.920]   Although I kind of like it.
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:26.040]   It is bait switch, I guess.
[01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:32.960]   If you could figure out a way to sue eBay and the guy who scammed you out of $2,000 for
[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:36.000]   a non-existing camera.
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:37.640]   Would you like that money back?
[01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:39.360]   I got it back actually.
[01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:40.360]   The PayPal.
[01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:43.000]   Well, I think enough publicity they finally PayPal just said, all right, we'll give you
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.000]   the money back.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.720]   But I don't think that that really had anything to do with their real policy.
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:49.720]   It had more to do with that.
[01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:50.720]   No.
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:51.720]   That's the.
[01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:52.720]   That's the.
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:59.720]   We have to get a sponsor for Don't Give the Week.
[01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:02.080]   Who would be the best sponsor for Don't Give the Week?
[01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:03.080]   The toilets.
[01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:04.080]   The toilets.
[01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:05.080]   The toilets.
[01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:06.080]   Those toilets.
[01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:07.080]   Or Mark Cuban.
[01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:08.080]   Yeah.
[01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:09.080]   Mark Cuban.
[01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:10.080]   Don't give the.
[01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:11.080]   Yeah.
[01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:13.560]   I think Calacanis.com is going to sponsor this.
[01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:15.080]   I think you should sponsor it.
[01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:16.480]   I'll charge you a dollar.
[01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:17.480]   It's all.
[01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:18.480]   All right.
[01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:19.480]   That's it.
[01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:20.480]   The Calacanis.com official.
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:21.480]   Don't give the.
[01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:22.480]   Don't give the.
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:23.480]   Don't give the.
[01:06:23.480 --> 01:06:24.480]   Don't give the.
[01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:25.480]   Don't give the.
[01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:26.480]   Don't give the.
[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:27.480]   Don't give the.
[01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:28.480]   Don't give the.
[01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:29.480]   Don't give the.
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:30.480]   Don't give the.

[01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:33.480]   Don't give the.
[01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:34.480]   Don't give the.
[01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:35.480]   Don't give the.

[01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:39.480]   Don't give the.
[01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:40.480]   Don't give the.
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:41.480]   Don't give the.
[01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:42.480]   Don't give the.
[01:06:42.480 --> 01:06:43.480]   Don't give the.
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:44.480]   Don't give the.
