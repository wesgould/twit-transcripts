[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.320]   It's our Memorial Day weekend show.
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.560]   So I want to thank all the people who are here
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.120]   because they gave up their lives.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.480]   Practically to be here, Jason Snell.
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.160]   Good to have you from sixcolors.com.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.560]   Happy new year, Jack.
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.040]   Appreciate it.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.920]   You didn't have a barbecue or anything going on.
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.960]   No, not this weekend.
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:09.960]   Good.
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.440]   Well, we're glad you're here.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.880]   Oh, and JJ Stone is here.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.880]   We know he gave up a pool party full of beautiful women.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.120]   I'm here under protest and arrest.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.120]   And if you're seeing this transmission, call 911.
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.240]   I need assistance.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.640]   You can blame Christina Warren because she was booked
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.320]   and she bailed at the last minute.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.240]   She's probably at that pool party right now.
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.760]   Right?
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.080]   Right?
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.920]   Living a dream, living my dream.
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.760]   I am very grateful, Owen.
[00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.920]   Thank you so much for being here.
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.320]   Also-- whoa, careful.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.080]   Are you wearing pants?
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.320]   Because it almost was a gut check time.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.600]   It says, I just made it.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.240]   I just learned last his last appearance.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.760]   It got darker and darker.
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.400]   And people were saying, turn on the light.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.000]   And he just told us he couldn't get up
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.120]   because he wasn't wearing pants.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.520]   And I'm currently not wearing pants.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.120]   Let's just let it be known that any time--
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.320]   Oh, Lord.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.520]   I am not wearing pants.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.840]   OK.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:02.640]   So--
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.840]   She am I.
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.320]   America.
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.680]   People die from my freedoms.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.520]   And I have the freedom to not wear pants in my own home.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.280]   Very appropriate.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.680]   Go commando, Memorial Day.
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.040]   Thank you, Ruby.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.400]   Memorial Day.
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.920]   Jason Heiners, also here.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.560]   It's good to have you from CBS Interactive and Tech Republic.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.000]   And beautiful Louisville.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.920]   Louisville, Kentucky.
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:21.360]   Louisville.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.040]   Yes.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.000]   Did you go to the Derby?
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.320]   I did not go to the Derby.
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.920]   You have to be a millionaire.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.840]   I'm not quite that much of a high roller.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.120]   I know I tell this story all the time.
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.680]   We used to have a box at the Derby during the dot-com era
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.840]   when--
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.720]   Oh, as if Davis did, yeah.
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:36.480]   Beautiful.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:37.880]   Well, actually Tech Republic did.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:38.640]   Tech Republic.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.200]   Wow.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:39.760]   Yeah.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.800]   Yeah, when we were--
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.840]   before we got bought by CNET.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.520]   And we had a box on Millionaire's Row.
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.880]   One of the best boxes on Millionaire's Row
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.440]   because we were, you know, dot-com.
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.680]   Phenom at that point.
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.640]   And money was cheap.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.160]   Wow.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.040]   Well, you know, you still can get a good slice of Derby pie
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.200]   in town.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.880]   I can still get a piece of Derby pie
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.600]   and watch it on my home screen.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.960]   Yes.
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.520]   Nice to have you all.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.640]   And a salute to all our men and women in the armed forces
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.640]   who risk their lives for us every day,
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.200]   and especially to those who gave the ultimate sacrifice
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.240]   on this Memorial Day weekend.
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.760]   We were very grateful to you all.
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.880]   And I've worn my American flag tie.
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.200]   I don't know if that.
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.760]   Twice a year I get to break this out.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:28.920]   Rosh Hashanah and--
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:29.560]   No, no.
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.360]   On Fourth of July, I'll wear it again.
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.720]   Nice.
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.480]   Yeah.
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:34.200]   Well done.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.280]   So as long as we're talking column--
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.320]   solemn notes, a very kind of surprising and sad story,
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.080]   you may remember a beautiful mind.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.120]   Remember that?
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.480]   The story of mathematician John Nash, who was schizophrenic
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.840]   and amazing hallucinations, and yet was also
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.600]   a brilliant mathematician.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:02.840]   He and his wife killed in a crash on the Jersey Turnpike
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.680]   yesterday.
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.920]   They were in a cab coming home from Norway.
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.080]   He'd just given a talk in Norway.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.240]   And they weren't wearing seatbelts.
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.200]   And we're thrown from the cab when it got in a wreck.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:15.760]   And both passed away.
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.160]   Nash was 86.
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.840]   His wife, Alicia Nash, was 82.
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.120]   Nash was very famous for many things,
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.000]   but particularly won the Nobel Prize for his game theory
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.120]   work.
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.960]   In fact, there was a good article or a good conversation.
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.760]   Let me see if I can find it on Quora talking about what
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.680]   he came up with.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.480]   And the idea that even in complex games
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.200]   that an equilibrium would often be reached, the example
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.360]   they give often is the detente that
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.480]   was reached between the Soviet Union and the United States.
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.880]   Because both had nuclear weapons and mutually assured
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.640]   destruction kept both from using them.
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.080]   An equilibrium was reached.
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.560]   And war never did break out between the US and the Soviet
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.480]   Union despite decades of tension.
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.600]   The other example that the guy in Quora gives
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.200]   is if I come home early and my wife gets home late,
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.440]   then I have to sit around waiting for her.
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.360]   If she gets home early and I'm late,
[00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.760]   it's just a sit-away I'm waiting for me.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.040]   The equilibrium is we both get home early.
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.200]   And then we have time with each other.
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:26.320]   Anyway, John Nash is very sad.
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.400]   And you need to wear your seatbelt.
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.120]   The thing that was creepy about that, a mile from my house
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.960]   and then another one on the highway.
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.080]   Yesterday, all run the same time, three car accidents.
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:41.480]   And all cars had someone ejected from the seat.
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.640]   The other two car crash had.
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:44.960]   The passenger was ejected and both of them died.
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:45.960]   And then this happened.
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:46.760]   And you're in a cab.
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.160]   I guess you don't wear your seatbelt, but for peace and all.
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.040]   I always buckle my seatbelt.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.040]   I don't know why you assume that a cab is somehow
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.200]   going to be magically safer than driving your own car.
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.240]   Especially if you're on the highway.
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.240]   If you're in the city and you're just scooting about,
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.640]   the impact isn't going to be that great.
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:00.800]   But if you're out on the highway doing it,
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.840]   you find out, let's put a seatbelt on.
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.480]   Very sad.
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.360]   And we should all watch a beautiful mind this week,
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.760]   which is a great movie, "Wrestle Crow" playing.
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:12.240]   Although it fell prey as many movies
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.560]   about mathematicians to this kind of notion
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.360]   that mathematicians are somehow magically--
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:17.960]   Exactly.
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:18.480]   Yeah.
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.280]   Same thing happened in the social network.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.080]   They're writing formulas on Windows.
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.200]   In fact, Nash did the same thing,
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.920]   writing the formulas on Windows.
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:30.280]   Comes to them with a great flash of revelation.
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.080]   And I think many mathematicians find that a little insulting.
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.600]   Like, no, I did some work.
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.320]   I actually figured that out.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.760]   Anyway, I hate to begin on this sad note.
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:41.920]   Google I/O coming up.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.520]   We have a bunch of nice people in the studio visiting from G.
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.120]   Is it GDG, the Google's developer groups?
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.600]   They're all over the world.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.880]   This is a group from Spain.
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:52.640]   Nice to have you.
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:53.040]   Welcome.
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.560]   They'll be going to Google I/O on Thursday.
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.000]   Just were down at the campus in Mountain View.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.960]   And I was talking to Andreu.
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.760]   And I said, did you know anything about what's
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:01.640]   happening in Google I/O?
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:03.120]   And he chid his face.
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.320]   He said, I--
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.120]   So I'm going to watch you carefully, Andreu,
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.840]   when we start speculating.
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.760]   And just tug your ear if it's on track.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:14.560]   And if it's wrong, just frown.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.800]   Can we get a camera on him to check the pictures of the press?
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:16.800]   I know.
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.200]   Talk.
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.000]   I know.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.040]   This is rare that we actually get somebody in here.
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.440]   Hey, could you bring me my cardboard?
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.600]   I meant to get it when I was over there.
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.440]   It's on my desk last year.
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.880]   So one of the reasons people love going to Google I/O is because
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:32.120]   Google is really pretty generous with gear.
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.040]   Last year you got a pixel--
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:35.280]   well, no, that was two years ago.
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.200]   You got a pixel.
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.360]   Last year you got cardboard.
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.840]   It was a little disappointing.
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:42.720]   It was a flat piece of cardboard on the wheelchair.
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:43.840]   It's tough times at Google.
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.520]   But then Gina Trapani made this for me because she was there
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:47.520]   last year.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.360]   And she folded it in the car on the way up.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.360]   And it turned out this is actually one of the coolest
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.960]   things ever because this is Google cardboard.
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.040]   And it's Google's virtual reality thing.
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.320]   And you can go out and buy a lot--
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.640]   Oculus Rift for a lot of money or Gear VR for Samsung
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:02.960]   for a few hundred dollars.
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:07.560]   The Gear VR does the same thing this does for nothing.
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.520]   Well, it does a little more.
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:10.640]   It does it?
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:11.160]   It does.
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:11.960]   It does actually.
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:14.680]   It's got extra sensors in it that help--
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:15.720]   Oh, wow.
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.040]   You can turn your head.
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:17.520]   You're right.
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:18.000]   You're right.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.760]   Although, wait a minute, doesn't the phone
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.040]   have the accelerator and the phone do all that?
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.360]   The phone does most of the work.
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:28.960]   But it does some-- the Gear VR does a few things that enhance
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.520]   the experience, as it were.
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:35.120]   It's adding some more power to the sensors.
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.240]   But you know, it's cool because they've also released
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:40.400]   this thing.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:43.240]   They released this publicly.
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.640]   You can make your own.
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:45.880]   And other--
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:48.440]   Yeah, it's like an open source design.
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:48.960]   Yeah.
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.960]   And other people have made these.
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:57.720]   There is a company that makes those great wooden cases--
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:58.520]   Yeah.
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:09:59.440]   --for iPads.
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.280]   Bamboo.
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:00.800]   Bamboo.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.560]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.560]   You can buy nicer ones than cardboard.
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:07.560]   But you could also pre-order them.
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.240]   Yeah, the Savannah Art and Design.
[00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.360]   Savannah College of Art and Design does this cool thing.
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:16.200]   They sent to all of their students who they're kind of
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:16.880]   courting.
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.040]   They send these--
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.040]   OK.
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.040]   --the ones that they branded them.
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:22.640]   Savannah College of Art and Design Scad.
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:27.360]   And then they send these basically Google cardboard
[00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:27.840]   versions.
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:31.480]   And then you can download their app to your iPhone or Android.
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.560]   You plop it in there.
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.600]   And then it's got views of all their campus.
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:38.760]   It's got-- it's like the coolest pitch for a school
[00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:39.440]   that I've ever seen.
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.520]   I was like, if I was deciding between multiple schools
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.400]   and I was a little bit kind of forward-looking, progressive,
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.440]   kind of a techie, I would see this
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.960]   and I would just be blown away.
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.040]   This is inspired.
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.160]   I was so neat.
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.560]   This is inspired.
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.040]   So you get in and they say, well, good,
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.480]   here's a virtual tour of the campus where you're going to go.
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.560]   You can put your phone in here.
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.840]   Oh, that is really a great idea.
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:04.440]   We had one in-- Aaron Carson from Tech Republic
[00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.120]   has been writing a lot on virtual reality,
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:10.440]   on the business applications of virtual reality
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:13.640]   beyond gaming for most of this year.
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:17.120]   She also did a great long feature on--
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:20.240]   can virtual reality kind of mend its broken promise?
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.920]   It's been promised for 30 years that it's going to happen.
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.200]   And will it finally happen?
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.880]   We did a great long-form piece on this.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.400]   She did a great long-form piece on this.
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.400]   That's a good use for it, I think.
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:33.960]   A virtual tour of your future home.
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.400]   Yep, yep.
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.040]   I mean, again, if I got this, if I was a student,
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.440]   I was trying to decide between schools,
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.480]   this would be, you know, this would be big.
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.320]   I'm pretty low cost.
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.680]   But there's one from, because doesn't the student
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.800]   have to have an Android phone?
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.080]   Or iOS?
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:51.320]   It works in iOS?
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.160]   Oh, good.
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:52.520]   It does.
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:53.800]   It works in iOS or Android.
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:57.560]   You download the app and you pop your phone in the thing
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:58.760]   and then you go to town.
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.160]   Neat.
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.160]   That is a great marketing idea.
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.800]   Google actually did this themselves
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:06.600]   when they opened up their London store.
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.600]   They have an app that you can download for cardboard
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.720]   so you can do a virtual tour of it.
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:12.520]   I'm still not--
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:13.000]   So cool.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.400]   Completely bullish on VR.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.920]   But there are some things where that's really--
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:20.200]   but the nice thing about cardboard is it's not immersive.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.320]   It's a little closer to a few master than immersive.
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.280]   And I don't-- immersive, I think, is not necessarily
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:26.000]   a good idea.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.920]   I kind of worry about putting this helmet on
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.440]   and losing touch with my surroundings.
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.400]   Maybe I'm just paranoid.
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.520]   But I'm worried somebody's going to sneak up behind me.
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.160]   Three weeks ago, didn't I just yell at you?
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.480]   Because you were telling me how much you loved virtual reality
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.160]   and digital space time.
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.160]   That was me.
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.280]   That was somebody else.
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:44.080]   You were yelling.
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.360]   At least you hated my warnings.
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.320]   That's all I care about.
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.280]   Somebody else.
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:52.160]   Actually, Paul Merlucky, who is the guy who founded Oculus Rift
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:55.920]   and then sold out to Facebook for several billion--
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:56.560]   how many billions?
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:57.680]   This was a 3.7.
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:58.640]   Huge.
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:03.800]   He's being sued by his previous employer,
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:08.840]   the appropriately named Total Recall Technologies.
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:12.200]   That is a good name for a VR company.
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.040]   They're in Hawaii.
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:17.840]   They say they hired Lucky to build a prototype at 2011.
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:22.160]   He worked for them for a year, latter half of 2011 into 2012.
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.160]   He got feedback and information to improve
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.920]   the design of the display, left, and then
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:30.040]   launched a Kickstarter campaign for his own head
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:33.200]   mounted display called the Oculus Rift.
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:33.800]   They want--
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:34.680]   $10 billion.
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.920]   $2 billion was the amount of Facebook paid.
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:37.960]   Yeah.
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:42.280]   So by the way, Oculus is a defendant as well.
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:42.960]   Yeah.
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:50.360]   Silicon Valley-- the Silicon Valley event was last week.
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.680]   And it was interesting.
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:55.920]   Lucky-- he's pretty prickly.
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:59.960]   He was on the panel for a young guy.
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:02.600]   He's pretty prickly.
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.320]   They were talking about all the VRs
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:06.560]   getting these multiple uses, kind of like the ones
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:10.440]   we were talking about, like Scadd and other things.
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:14.840]   Medical surgeons are using it so that you can learn how
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:16.600]   to do some of these things before you're
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.680]   messing with cadavers and stuff.
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:21.880]   All these kind of uses that are popping up all over the place
[00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:22.600]   right now.
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.480]   And he was not bullish on that at all.
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:28.160]   He was-- he would-- for him, it's like all about gaming
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:28.960]   and all of this stuff.
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.000]   I think he's kind of right.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.600]   Is people trying to justify where it's going and all
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:35.600]   of these kinds of things?
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.760]   So he says it is gaming.
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:38.880]   He says it's just gaming.
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:41.760]   And all these other things are wishful thinking.
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:43.200]   Well, I'm not sure I agree with that,
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.240]   but I think gaming is the obvious and best
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:46.360]   use for virtual reality.
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.200]   Because the purpose of virtual reality
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.160]   is immersive, right?
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.320]   To block out the rest of the world.
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:50.820]   Right.
[00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:51.640]   So for a game.
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.080]   AR stuff, like Microsoft's doing with HoloLens,
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.360]   is about annotating the actual world.
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.800]   And that's a very different interesting thing.
[00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.400]   But VR is all about blocking out the world.
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.800]   This scat thing is VR, right?
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.800]   I mean, the idea that you could--
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.760]   I like the idea that you could tour somewhere
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:09.240]   and feel like you can look around and be part of it.
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:14.320]   So Oculus has an announcement in a couple of weeks, June 11.
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:19.920]   Step into the Rift, which I don't know if it's really a good
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:22.360]   tagline that sounds like I'm going to fall.
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:24.840]   But what is this going to be the announcement
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:28.280]   of the commercial availability of something?
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:28.800]   Do we know?
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.440]   The only thing is they're hyping this.
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:33.640]   Like they were hyping it last week again, too.
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:36.680]   And it's not clear what they're doing.
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:37.800]   Like, what more is there to say?
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:38.200]   There's a commercial--
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.600]   Well, ship it.
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:40.560]   --ship it, right?
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:43.440]   But they've already said most of the details for that.
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.960]   Unless there's something else they're going to do,
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:48.200]   or-- I mean, the biggest thing that's missing
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.120]   is content, right?
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.760]   Content-- there has to be content you want to do.
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:55.480]   Unless my thought is just that unless they're
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:58.680]   making some announcements in terms of content and some
[00:15:58.680 --> 00:15:59.680]   maybe deals that they've signed--
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:00.680]   They've got to say.
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:01.180]   Yeah.
[00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:04.320]   The next call of duty is going to have an Oculus Rift version.
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.800]   There's got to be something like that, because otherwise,
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.440]   what's the hype I don't understand what they can do
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.640]   to get me interested in it or to turn it.
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:09.520]   Why would I buy it?
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.120]   It's going to be expensive, too, right?
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.520]   I mean, it can't be cheap.
[00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:16.000]   I mean, the SDK, the one that they've got out right now,
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.920]   is $400 for the hardware that they're essentially
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.680]   going to release to consumers or something similar to it.
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.800]   It's $400.
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.560]   And so you've got to think it's going
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:28.040]   to be in the $3, $4, $500 range.
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:31.480]   It's not going to work with any of the gaming systems.
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:32.800]   It's not going to work with Xbox.
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:36.560]   It's not going to work with Sony PlayStation.
[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:38.680]   It's only going to be for high-end PCs.
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:41.480]   They just threw off Mac.
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:44.320]   It really worked really crappy on Mac, as it were.
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.480]   So it's really only for PC gamers.
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:46.920]   Which is what most--
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:49.160]   They're saying no Linux, no Mac.
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:51.800]   You have to have a pretty high-end gaming PC
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:53.600]   to power the Oculus Rift.
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:56.600]   That might be why Paul Marlucky is saying no, it's gaming.
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.640]   At this point, it is gaming.
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:04.040]   You're going to be buying it as a peripheral for a gaming PC.
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:06.200]   If you are not-- I think you're going to be disappointed.
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:09.400]   If you don't have a high-end gaming PC
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.440]   and you buy this thing, you're probably
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.240]   going to be disappointed.
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.080]   And when we got one in, we tested it
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:16.080]   on seven different machines.
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:20.840]   And it could not get it to work until we installed it
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:26.000]   on a really high-end desktop PC and tweaked it and tuned it
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.760]   and looked through forums to get it to work
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:33.120]   and to get it up to 75 frames per second, which
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:36.040]   is what you need to not puke every time you look at the thing.
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.240]   And it was not easy.
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.760]   And so they've got a long way to go in six months or so
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.120]   before they released to the public.
[00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:45.640]   Because right now, trying to use this thing
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.000]   is a serious exercise in front of people.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.600]   I got a prediction on JJ Stone.
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:50.880]   It's not going to be the Oculus Rift.
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.320]   It's going to be the Oculus Beats.
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:56.680]   And it's going to be the tie-in with Beats headphones.
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.400]   It's going to have built-in Beats sound.
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:17:59.000]   What do you think?
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.680]   You mean it?
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:05.280]   The sound is exquisite coming back from Owen JJ Stone.
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.080]   Oh, there it is.
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:06.560]   There it is.
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:07.400]   I got you.
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.760]   So basically, do these people not talk to gamers?
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.600]   Because people that game-- the reason they're on PC
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:15.080]   is because they want that speed and accesses
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:15.920]   you get from a computer.
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.280]   So I'm going to put something on my face.
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.800]   It's going to be janky and slow.
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.000]   I don't understand.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:20.800]   Stop making it.
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:21.600]   Give up.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:26.280]   In life of 4.5, you've got $2 billion to make.
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:27.400]   I don't care.
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.960]   People give people money all the time for stupid reasons.
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:31.200]   This is a stupid reason.
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:33.560]   You made something that only works on high-end PCs.
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:36.520]   The people that build their own computer and play games
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.280]   love the feel and the touch of the mouse
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:39.680]   and the speed of the game.
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:41.360]   I'm not going to put something on my eyes
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.880]   to make me slow down.
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:44.680]   And I don't think it's going to work.
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.520]   And that's the market you're marketing to.
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:48.280]   They've already spent all their money on their computer.
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:50.800]   They ain't got no money for no Oculus for it.
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:51.760]   Oh, that's not true.
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:55.280]   I see people who buy what seats for driving games
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.200]   that move you around and they've got pedals and a steering wheel.
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.440]   So you're really driving on the Indy 500 or something like that.
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.440]   Like I said, they spent all their money on Kaleo.
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.000]   That's the very bottom of that.
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.560]   That was as real as it can get.
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:08.680]   I mean, I imagine they're going to sell a lot of graphics
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:11.160]   cards and possibly even systems that
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.840]   are saying this works with Oculus Rift.
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:14.920]   I imagine they'll do that.
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.200]   But that's going to be the first wave, right?
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.600]   It's people with super high end or will just
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:20.160]   spend this money just for fun.
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:23.360]   But there's a long way to go from there to the mainstream, right?
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.600]   First off, it's only on PCs, not consoles.
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.520]   And you're going to have the high specs.
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:30.680]   And then maybe if it goes well, it trickles down,
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.840]   but they've got to make software announcements, right?
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:35.280]   They've got to have software announcements.
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:38.600]   If Palmer Lucky is right, it's just for gaming, why Facebook?
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.640]   They must-- Facebook must have seen more than just gaming
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:41.480]   in this thing.
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.400]   Why would they buy it?
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:44.880]   Unless they plan to become a--
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:48.600]   I think Farmville in a 3D world would be just spectacular.
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.920]   Well, if they feel that this is foundational technology,
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.040]   this is the leader in something that's going to be big.
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:55.560]   Is it that different than Google investing a lot of money
[00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:57.320]   in self-driving cars or something?
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.480]   Is that going to fit with what Google's doing with Search?
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:00.360]   Maybe, maybe not.
[00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:02.800]   But if they feel like in 20 years or 30 years,
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:04.400]   self-driving cars is going to be a thing,
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:05.640]   why would you not want to own that?
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:07.000]   And they've got the money to spend.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.160]   What kind of feel like that's what Facebook did is they've
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:10.400]   got the money to spend and anything.
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.480]   VR is going to be something, probably.
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:16.760]   So why not buy the leader and see if you can use your money
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:17.800]   to push them?
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.720]   You're right in one respect, Ellen.
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.120]   If you're a gamer, what do you want?
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:21.960]   You want two things.
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:25.640]   You want high resolution and you want high frame rate.
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:29.360]   And it's very likely that the rift--
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.240]   I mean, it'll be--
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:32.280]   maybe it will be.
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:35.160]   They're saying, I think that the consumer version may be as much
[00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.120]   as 25, 60 by 1440.
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:39.720]   That's hard to do with two screens.
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:43.400]   But you're not just buying frame rate and resolution.
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:44.880]   You're buying immersion, right?
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:47.600]   And I think that's the argument for the Oculus,
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.480]   is that it's giving you a different kind of immersion.
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:52.200]   Because you're not looking at a screen anymore,
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.520]   and it's moving with your vision.
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:54.520]   I'm not sure I buy that.
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:56.120]   But that would be the argument, is that this
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:58.320]   is all about high resolution, higher frame rates,
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:59.840]   or something like Oculus are all trying
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:02.000]   to get you to a more immersive gaming experience.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.720]   The current versions are much lower resolution,
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:07.320]   but I'm now seeing among gaming magazines and stuff
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:10.880]   that they think the consumer version will be that quad
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:11.440]   resolution.
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:12.960]   That'd be pretty impressive.
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:16.600]   If you can get the latency way down frame rate up
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:19.680]   at that resolution, the computer--
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.800]   that's why you have a have to have a heavy computer.
[00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:25.000]   And a perfect world, it'd probably be awesome.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.840]   So I'd like to see it in a perfect world.
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.240]   Maybe I'm wrong.
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:32.280]   But even when you say something about smart cars,
[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.040]   at least smart cars, some of the people are lazy,
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:35.280]   they don't want to drive.
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:37.280]   That sounds like something that's useful.
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:39.400]   I really would like to know what they think this is really
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:40.440]   going to do.
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:41.960]   They must think this is going to change gaming.
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.320]   Someone sold them on.
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:45.000]   This is going to change the way we game.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.440]   And then after gaming, we're going to attack other things.
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:48.120]   But I like it.
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:49.280]   Someone's been sold on.
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:50.160]   We're changing the game.
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:51.200]   But what about the metaverse?
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.640]   What about a 3D social world that we can all go?
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.520]   That's what I thought Facebook would want to do, right?
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:59.240]   This kind of simulated VR world.
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.480]   What's that thing called?
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:01.840]   Do you think Snow Crash basically
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.320]   marks Zuckerberg red snowcrash?
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:03.800]   Yeah.
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:04.560]   This is it.
[00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:06.360]   I do think it is Second Life.
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:07.240]   Second Life.
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:07.920]   There it is.
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:08.600]   There it is.
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:09.840]   I know a lot of people-- some people
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:11.800]   lost their families over Second Life really.
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.760]   That was the original catfish boy.
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:16.120]   You and that--
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:20.040]   I have a friend who is a Second Life photographer.
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.040]   What?
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:23.400]   Oh, I know what you're saying.
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.080]   Yeah, I know if I have a buddy who makes clothes
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:25.560]   for Second Life.
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:26.080]   Yeah.
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:26.840]   Make money.
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:27.880]   I'm like, wait, what?
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:31.080]   He goes, OK, so you have an avatar in Second Life
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:33.680]   and you get it all dolled up, right?
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:36.280]   And then apparently you can pose.
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:37.280]   Yeah.
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.840]   And then he somehow gets screen grabs of people
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:41.840]   in their Second Life attire posing.
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.240]   And then he posts them on Facebook.
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.040]   It's very creepy.
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:47.200]   America.
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:48.360]   America.
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:49.200]   America.
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.920]   You can buy nude suits.
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:52.720]   Oh my.
[00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:55.680]   No, you can buy a-- because you can costume any--
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:56.880]   you have a turn anyway.
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:01.560]   They sell like nakedness, which is very strange.
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:04.360]   Your avatar is clothed by default,
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:06.440]   but if you wish, you can buy new clothing
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:09.120]   so it'll look like you're naked.
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:13.560]   There is interesting-- there are some interesting VR social things.
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:15.440]   There's this thing called "Converged"
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.920]   in the Long Form article we did on VR.
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:21.240]   There's this "Converged" is this virtual world.
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:23.440]   The cool thing about it is it's Lord of the Rings.
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:26.320]   It's like Wofflorian.
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:27.920]   I want to be an elf.
[00:23:27.920 --> 00:23:29.680]   You sort of show up in there.
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:32.400]   And the cool thing, there's other people there hanging out.
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:36.240]   You sort of pick your, I don't know, character, whatever.
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.960]   But it's a virtual meetup space.
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:43.440]   And so you go in there and you can have a meetup.
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.400]   And there's also like a theater.
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:46.880]   So you can go-- and somebody can actually
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:51.320]   give a presentation on that theater and in the theater.
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:55.280]   And it'll go up on the screen in this sort of middle of the woods
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:56.440]   where there's this great screen.
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:58.440]   They also will watch YouTube videos together.
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:00.000]   They'll have screens and movies in there.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.040]   You can hang out.
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:05.520]   And it's sort of like a mystery science theater sort of thing.
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:07.280]   And yeah, it's interesting.
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:12.680]   And there is some something to it, I think.
[00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:15.200]   I think this is why Facebook is into it.
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.440]   And they could talk about this at F8 a little bit.
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:18.640]   That they see--
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:21.200]   Facebook started out as text updates.
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:22.720]   Right now it's photos.
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:24.560]   Next, they kind of see video.
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:27.600]   And then they see VR as sort of the--
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:32.520]   they see the evolution of status updates and those kind of things.
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:35.640]   I don't know that I buy that because VR is not--
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:39.280]   because it's so immersive, whereas right now,
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:40.800]   Facebook is kind of a drive-by thing.
[00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:44.320]   You can scan real quick and catch up on a lot of things
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:45.480]   and think with a lot of people.
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:47.120]   They want you to stay there forever, though.
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.320]   They want you to live there.
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.200]   Well, now we've got one way to do that.
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.720]   Now you're making me backtrack just a little bit.
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:54.160]   Because I do think about all my friends that play
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:55.480]   Grand Theft Auto.
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:56.640]   And I have the game.
[00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:58.480]   I played it for like weeks and I stopped because people
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.480]   are addicted to it.
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:01.080]   And they're like, they have hangouts.
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:02.480]   He's like, cool, come check out my man.
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:03.480]   That is a virtual world.
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.240]   It's a game, but it's also a virtual world.
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:07.480]   And they're all sitting in there showing each other their cars
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:08.880]   and making their car free.
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:13.000]   So I guess there's something to getting immersed
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.480]   in that situation.
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:15.840]   Like I said, perfect world tech.
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:17.240]   I need better stuff.
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:18.840]   And maybe that's what the announcement's going to be.
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:19.840]   It's going to be truly interesting.
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:20.840]   You finally fixed the problem.
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:23.520]   Chumlee in our chat room says you want an immersive call
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:25.560]   to duty enlist.
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:26.640]   Good point.
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:27.800]   Very realistic.
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:28.680]   That's funny.
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:29.680]   I'll get that on t-shirt.
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:30.880]   Really?
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:34.680]   Here's Eve Valkyrie, another tip from our chat room.
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:40.120]   This is a game designed to work with Oculus Rift.
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:41.160]   It's specifically Fort.
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:43.440]   And I would bet that if they make an announcement on the 11th,
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:45.880]   this will be one of the things they'll show.
[00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:50.080]   This is pre-alpha gameplay footage captured with a VR headset.
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:55.040]   You could see even on the web page that the fighter is wearing
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:56.680]   a headset, kind of a VR headset.
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:00.000]   You know, this looks a lot like one of those classic old star
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.520]   Raiders games where you're sitting in a cockpit.
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.600]   Yeah, it's from Eve Online.
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:05.960]   Yeah, this is Eve Online.
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:06.400]   Exactly.
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:09.880]   This is their VR version, Valkyrie they call it.
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:12.120]   You know, it would be a fun game.
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:14.960]   If I could just put that headset on and have the screen
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:18.080]   that Tony Stark looks at, but actually see my TV and do stuff
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.720]   and stuff pops up on my screen.
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:20.220]   Yeah.
[00:26:20.220 --> 00:26:21.120]   All right.
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:22.160]   I want to be Iron Man.
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:22.840]   I got to get one.
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:23.360]   There you go.
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:23.920]   Yeah.
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:24.440]   There you go.
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:25.440]   Give me Iron Man game.
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:30.200]   And if I could just like talk to Jarvis and have my stuff popping up.
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:31.280]   OK, I'm buying--
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:32.320]   This would be a better way to play.
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:33.040]   They got me.
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:33.360]   If you didn't--
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:34.200]   If you didn't-- if you didn't make it--
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:34.640]   If you didn't make it--
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:35.400]   I'm doing everything.
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:35.880]   Right.
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:38.560]   I think I feel like it would make me queasy now.
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:42.560]   I get queasy on the early edition Oculus Rift.
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:44.560]   I had the Kickstarter version.
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:45.800]   And I've tried the second version.
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:47.280]   But I'm told that the new version--
[00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:48.000]   Say it's better.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.520]   --are higher resolution less than Lacey.
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:52.040]   And those are the things that make you a little queasy.
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:54.720]   The higher the quality, supposedly, the less likely
[00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:55.760]   are to get queasy.
[00:26:55.760 --> 00:27:01.120]   And I mean, the folks from HTC that are doing the new--
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:01.120]   Right.
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.360]   They have one too, don't they?
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:02.920]   Yeah.
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:03.360]   Yeah.
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:08.240]   They say on that one, there's nobody will get sick from it.
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.400]   They say the quality is so high.
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:14.040]   It's like 75 FPS frames per second or more.
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:16.840]   And they said zero people will get sick from it.
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:20.480]   I think that's-- they're inviting ridicule.
[00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:23.760]   But that's how confident they are in the quality
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:24.680]   of what it's going to be.
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:25.760]   This is pretty compelling.
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:28.640]   I mean, I could see getting sucked into a game like this.
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:29.600]   Totally.
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:33.160]   And being like living in this start.
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.280]   That's the stuff that's going to be most exciting
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:36.520]   is the immersive world stuff.
[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:39.000]   Like, yeah, World of Warcraft is a good example of that.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:39.800]   Or something like this.
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:40.640]   Yeah.
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.640]   Because you can look around.
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:43.400]   I mean, people spend--
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:44.720]   Well, this makes sense too, because you're not walking.
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:47.040]   You're flying a spaceship.
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:48.800]   So you don't have to deal with that other issue,
[00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:51.160]   which is you need to use controls to move.
[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:52.120]   And you can just look around.
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:53.480]   You're strapped into a chair.
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.400]   So it's a perfect analog for what you're actually doing.
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:56.280]   That's what you'll have to do.
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:57.920]   You'll have constrained environments at first
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:58.880]   that will make sense.
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.840]   You need to put me in an ex-wing fighter.
[00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:02.120]   If you can put me in an ex-wing fighter,
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:03.480]   I could go take down the Death Star.
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:04.760]   You know, I'd probably be in.
[00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:05.280]   Yeah.
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.000]   Yeah, this looks pretty cool.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.120]   We're changing our tune right here.
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:08.920]   Yeah, we are.
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:09.440]   Right there.
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:09.960]   I don't know.
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:10.920]   It's pretty compelling.
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:11.960]   I already ordered mine.
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:12.800]   You know what I mean?
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:15.720]   They go and they give me a grand charismo or something
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:18.520]   where I can drive everybody that I was saving up for.
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:19.880]   My Tesla, I'm in there.
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:22.320]   I can live vicariously through my rift.
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:23.480]   Enter the rough.
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:24.480]   That's on Tatooine.
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.480]   I mean, I--
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.520]   So actually, well, then when you said gamers
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:29.640]   have spent all their money, well, I was thinking,
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:32.280]   there's people playing flight sims with, you know,
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:34.200]   basically surround cockpits because they
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:35.160]   have multiple monitors.
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:36.600]   I mean, that's not at all.
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:38.600]   Those people are broke now, Uncle Ray.
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:39.480]   Well, that's my point.
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:40.320]   They're broke.
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:40.880]   They're broke.
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:42.440]   Their wives left them long ago, but they
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:44.840]   don't even know because the macaroni and cheese just
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:46.320]   sits there on the shelf.
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:47.480]   We're going to take a break.
[00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:49.880]   When we come back, I want to know what Google's got planned.
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:53.280]   We kind of got into this starting with the cardboard.
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:55.360]   But what will be they be talking about at Google I/O
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:56.360]   on Thursday?
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:00.600]   Our coverage, by the way, will be live from Google I/O.
[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:02.480]   Jeff Jarvis will be there.
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:04.480]   And you're going right, Jason.
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:05.040]   How are you going?
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:05.760]   I'll be there.
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:08.080]   So Wednesday, when we do this, we can Google,
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:08.920]   we'll do a preview.
[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:11.240]   But then Thursday, we're going to do live coverage.
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:16.040]   The keynote begins 9.30 Pacific, 12.30 Eastern time.
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:18.960]   So I will be doing TNT on Thursday morning.
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.760]   And then we'll segue right into that coverage
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:25.440]   with Gina Trapani, Ron Richards, Aaron Newcomb, you, I hope.
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.760]   And we'll do what we always do, which is watch the keynote
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.160]   together and then comment on it.
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:32.320]   If you want to watch the rock, you can do that instead.
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:36.240]   But that's 9.30 Thursday, Pacific time, 12.30 Eastern,
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:40.120]   and 16.30 UTC, live.switch.tv.
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:41.920]   Hey, I will shave clean.
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:45.400]   I will shave well for that show because I will shave with Harry's
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:47.120]   as I do every morning.
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:52.680]   If you are a shaver, you need to know about Harry's.
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:55.480]   Nobody likes to shave.
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:58.040]   Does anybody like look forward to shaving in the morning?
[00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:58.880]   I think not.
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:01.320]   But Harry's going to make it as close as you can get
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:02.680]   to something you want to do.
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:07.760]   Because Harry's is kind of fun, believe it or not.
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:09.520]   Start your day with the Harry's kit,
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:11.280]   and you can get these very affordably.
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:16.200]   This is the Truman kit, which features a handle.
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:17.200]   You've got four different colors.
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.880]   I think I have the orange handle.
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:20.240]   Three blades.
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.680]   Yeah, that's the orange channel.
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:22.440]   Three blades.
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:23.680]   These are really good blades.
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:27.400]   I'll explain what makes Harry's blade so special in a second.
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:30.720]   You also get either the foaming shave gel, which I really
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:32.520]   like if you use something like Gillette Edge.
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:34.600]   This is similar, although better.
[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:35.760]   And boy, does this smell good?
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:38.400]   Or you can get the shave cream, which is what I use.
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:40.720]   If it comes in a tube, that really gives you
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:41.600]   a nice, smooth shave.
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:43.360]   You also get this little--
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:45.400]   I like this-- this little protector
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:48.840]   for your shaving kit so that when you travel around,
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:50.800]   let's the blade dry, but you don't cut yourself
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:52.240]   when you reach your hand.
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.920]   Now, all of this, normally $15, I'm
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:56.080]   going to get you $5 off your first order.
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:01.000]   When you go to harries.com, use the offer code TWIT5 at checkout.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:03.400]   Harry's is more than just the kit, though,
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:05.120]   because once you buy the kit, then you're
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:06.840]   going to want to get the Harry's blades.
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:08.360]   You can get them by subscription.
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:09.520]   I used to get them every other month.
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:12.000]   Now, I get them every month because I love having a fresh blade.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.200]   There's something about it.
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.440]   That's part of the secret to Harry's
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:17.840]   is because Harry's blades are half the price of the drugstore
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:21.480]   blades and twice as good, you don't mind changing the blade
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:21.960]   more often.
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:23.920]   You get a better shave, a cleaner shave.
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:25.320]   While you're at the Harry's site,
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.520]   I know Father's Day is coming next month.
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:30.600]   You might want to take a look for Dad and a few other things.
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.560]   You get the Winston set engraved.
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:34.920]   That's just a little bit more, $25.
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:37.040]   And they have a special Father's Day Shaves that-- actually,
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:38.800]   this would be great for $40--
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:40.720]   that includes, in your choice of the forming
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:46.880]   jaw of the shave cream, the personalized razor and stand--
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:50.080]   I like that-- plus all the blades and the cream and everything.
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:51.840]   This is a nice gift for Father's Day.
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:53.800]   Is it bad if I get myself that for Father's Day?
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:31:54.800]   No, that's great.
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:57.120]   Your daughter's too young to really know what to get you.
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:59.240]   Yeah, I'm going to give it a world on the old noggin
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:00.800]   and see how smooth I can get it.
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:01.520]   Oh, you know what?
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:02.920]   For somebody who shaves their head,
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:04.840]   this is a really good idea.
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:05.960]   I never shaved my head.
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:08.000]   Once I shaved it once, that was it.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.320]   But I think this would be--
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:11.600]   I know many of our viewers do this.
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.320]   H-A-R-R-Y-S.com.
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:15.160]   And when you do it, don't forget to use the offer.
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:20.240]   Go to it5 at checkout to save $5 off your first purchase.
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:21.040]   I just got the stand.
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:22.000]   It's kind of cool.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   The reason I like it is because Lisa keeps stealing my razor.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.040]   So now I got the stand.
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:28.840]   It says, keep your hands off.
[00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:31.080]   Keep your mitts off my Harry's.
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:32.240]   They own the factory.
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:34.920]   That's how come their blades are sharper, better,
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:36.680]   high performance blades.
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:41.640]   The very best at Harry's.com.
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:43.320]   Google I-A, are you going to go?
[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:45.160]   No, you're just going to watch them before you said.
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:47.080]   I don't watch the stream.
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:48.680]   What are we expecting?
[00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:51.960]   There is a leak from Android Police.
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:54.000]   And we've heard this leak, but I think
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.200]   I'm starting to believe this, that Google is going to do
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:33:02.200]   a new Photos app that will basically take all the features
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:04.760]   Google+'s photos app, the AutoAusums,
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:07.600]   although they're going to rename that Assistant,
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:10.440]   and make it stand alone.
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:13.560]   Which, if you're a Google+ fan, might worry a little bit,
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:15.320]   because actually, that's one of the best features
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:17.200]   of Google+.
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:19.480]   In the app that they're going to put out,
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:21.440]   they call it the current app because that's the one they're
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:21.800]   saying.
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:23.960]   This could change.
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:28.880]   But users can create movies, animations, collages.
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:30.720]   But the stories feature from Google+
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:35.000]   is not there, nor is the albums feature.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.520]   And it sounds like, I would hope you could share back
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:44.120]   to Google+, album movie story animation collage.
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:46.040]   If it doesn't let you share back to Google+,
[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:48.600]   then that's the big news, right?
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:50.280]   But I think it will.
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:52.040]   This looks like a phone app.
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:54.880]   I don't see a tablet of you on this one.
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:56.520]   The Assistant will make it easy to use.
[00:33:56.520 --> 00:33:59.080]   You know, Google already has.
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:01.640]   They purchased a snap stream.
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:06.320]   And the new version of Snap Seed is easily the best photo app
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:08.560]   I find on Android and iOS right now.
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:10.600]   I love you, Snap Seed.
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:13.200]   Well, actually, Google integrated
[00:34:13.200 --> 00:34:17.560]   a bunch of Snap Seed features into--
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:20.400]   well, actually, just into your main camera app.
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:23.800]   So if you go and edit an image, you'll
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:26.240]   see a lot of the same features from the old version
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:27.000]   of Snap Seed.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.760]   So maybe they'll do some sort of combining of the new stuff.
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:31.640]   There's no reason to assume that they're
[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:35.080]   going to take stuff out of Google+.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:37.080]   They've been doing that.
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:37.600]   No.
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:39.200]   That's kind of what they've been doing.
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:41.920]   I don't necessarily think that that means Google+ goes away,
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:45.080]   though, because they've just actually
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:47.960]   unveiled a new feature to it, not too long ago with collections.
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:50.040]   So they're obviously paying attention to it.
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.680]   Basically, now they're just saying, hey, photos
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:54.360]   can come in handy all over the place.
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:58.000]   So the Bloomberg leak said posting images directly
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.880]   to Facebook and Twitter would also
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:02.360]   be a part of this new photo service, which--
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:04.600]   I mean, in Android, you can kind of do that anyways,
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:05.960]   just with the share intent.
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:08.600]   But maybe it's going to be a little bit more embedded.
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:10.880]   So I think they're just saying, hey, these tools are good
[00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:12.560]   for other services as well.
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:12.880]   Right.
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:13.360]   Why not?
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:14.480]   Why not?
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:17.280]   I think we're really missing a good photo,
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:18.760]   a good place to do photos right now.
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:20.280]   I mean, Flickr has kind of died.
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:22.120]   Yahoo's tried to do a few things with it.
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:27.720]   But it's just not-- it's just lagged for so long.
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:29.440]   500 pixels is interesting, but it's
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:31.400]   really more for professional photographers.
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:34.840]   There's not such a good place for everybody
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:38.720]   who just wants to put their photos online in groups,
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:40.240]   other than Facebook.
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:42.200]   I mean, Facebook's basically a photo sharing site.
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:45.120]   But Facebook doesn't have great photo tools or even
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:47.360]   basic photo tools for the average person.
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:50.360]   It just says, I want to put my photos up,
[00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:53.160]   and I want to do a few albums and a place
[00:35:53.160 --> 00:35:55.400]   to put my favorite stuff.
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:57.400]   They're Instagram for that.
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:58.680]   I mean, Instagram, right?
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:00.480]   But Instagram's only mobile, too.
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:03.680]   I mean, it's not some place you can do--
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:07.440]   I know most people are doing their photos mobile now.
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.080]   And so when you're talking about professional,
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:10.720]   if so much professional, they're not
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:11.720]   worried about Facebook anyway.
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:13.160]   They're going to use whatever they're going to use.
[00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:15.080]   But average people like--
[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:16.360]   I know a few people that only use
[00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:19.080]   snap seed, Instagram and Facebook for their pictures.
[00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:21.960]   And this one girl doesn't have a computer,
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:25.800]   but she sells her pictures in a gallery locally.
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:28.160]   And she's taking pictures on her Samsung.
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:29.880]   And I'm like, how are you doing this with no camera?
[00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:31.520]   She's like, I can't afford a camera yet.
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:33.320]   So I was like, that's off your phone.
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:34.760]   She's like, yeah, now you snap seed.
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:35.960]   And she posts them on Facebook.
[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:37.000]   People buy her pictures.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.640]   And I'm like, she does all that without a computer.
[00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:40.960]   And I'm sitting over here with a Mark 35D.
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:41.680]   I'm looking at myself.
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:44.080]   I need to shut down Photoshop.
[00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:44.880]   I got this.
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:46.520]   I'm over here with this wake up tablet.
[00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:47.720]   What is the mom money?
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:50.320]   Is she over here with nothing?
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:51.920]   So everybody's amazing.
[00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:53.120]   Everybody's very depressing.
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:55.360]   It turns out you need talent.
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:57.000]   I thought if I just bought it more gear,
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.400]   I'd be a better photographer.
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:36:59.960]   But it's very disappointing.
[00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:01.760]   Snap seed is amazing, too.
[00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.760]   No one underestimate what you can do with Snap seed.
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:06.000]   I mean, it is like a Photoshop.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.800]   I mean, it is the equivalent, I think,
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:10.680]   of Photoshop for mobile.
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:15.840]   It's the most powerful editing tool that there is.
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:18.800]   And there are a few other things you can do to add to what
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:22.800]   it does and other kind of that do sort of cute little things.
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:24.840]   But Snap seed is super powerful.
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:27.600]   And the update that they give you is awesome.
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:28.160]   And it's free.
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:29.400]   Google bought it, made it free.
[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:30.840]   It's on iOS and Android.
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:34.280]   It's equally strong on both platforms.
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:37.600]   And it really is-- you can do amazing things with that.
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:39.720]   I've got another people-- a number of people
[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:43.880]   asked me about photos that they were like,
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:45.640]   how do you get the colors to pop like that?
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:46.640]   And it's like it's actually--
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:46.920]   You see it.
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:48.640]   --of the scene a little bit with Snap seed.
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:49.140]   Yeah.
[00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:49.640]   Yeah.
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:51.880]   And the Snap seed interface makes it very easy
[00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:54.520]   to turn up or down effects.
[00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:56.200]   So you really have a lot of control.
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:58.880]   I mean, this is a picture I just imported.
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:00.440]   It shows you a histogram.
[00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:01.880]   You could then choose your filters.
[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:05.160]   There's tools which allow you to things like crop, rotate,
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:07.320]   spot, repair, vignette.
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:09.000]   And then there's filters.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.640]   And here's the HDR scape.
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:11.520]   This is a good example.
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:12.320]   So it's a good one.
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:15.440]   As you turn up or down HDR as you choose
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:16.760]   and get it just right.
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:20.240]   And then if-- and some of the things, if you go up and down,
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:22.920]   yeah, this one too, you can choose different--
[00:38:22.920 --> 00:38:25.360]   this is actually a great interface for a touch.
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:25.840]   So let's say--
[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:26.360]   It is.
[00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:27.720]   --I want to change saturation.
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:30.280]   I can now turn that up or down.
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:35.200]   So I just-- I really feel like they kind of nailed it with this.
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:35.680]   And since--
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:36.180]   Yeah.
[00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:39.400]   --because these changes are all since Google bottom.
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:41.240]   This is not the stuff that Nick did.
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:41.760]   Yeah.
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:43.160]   This is stuff from Google.
[00:38:43.160 --> 00:38:45.200]   But Jason, do you think this is an opportunity
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:49.280]   because Apple has so badly fumbled eye photos?
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:53.120]   The eye photos to photos transition, I think, is a flop.
[00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:53.520]   I don't know.
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:54.720]   I like photos.
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:56.360]   The problem is that the photo storage
[00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:58.520]   is super expensive compared to all of the other--
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:38:59.080]   It's not common.
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:38:59.920]   --the other ones.
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:00.360]   --that everybody else.
[00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:00.880]   --that are out there.
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:02.080]   I think Apple's photos.
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:04.320]   I feel like Apple's kind of got their photo stuff together
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:05.960]   more than it ever has.
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:07.520]   But there's way more competition
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:09.200]   than there's ever been before.
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:12.120]   Well, I also feel like the transition
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:14.000]   was kind of forced upon you if you went
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   from to the newest Maverick O-Mason.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.640]   Well, in the latest version of Yosemite,
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:23.320]   what they did was they put photos in the dock and sort of me.
[00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:24.240]   You still have eye photos.
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:25.360]   Eye photos still there.
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:27.240]   And so I've heard from some people who feel like Apple
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:28.240]   forced them to move.
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:29.840]   In fact, as eye photos still there,
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:31.360]   they just felt like they were being pushed to--
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:33.640]   Yeah, but you don't feel like it's going to stay there for--
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:35.000]   We had a lot, right?
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.080]   And a lot of people, to be fair, are looking around
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:40.160]   for other options rather than jumping into photos.
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:41.640]   But competition is really interesting.
[00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:42.520]   Drop box.
[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:44.280]   I hear from a lot of people who store their--
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:47.800]   they use the Dropbox app to auto upload all their phone photos
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:48.320]   to drop boxes.
[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:51.040]   And they use something like Lightroom to manage them
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:51.800]   if they want to do that.
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:53.640]   I use Lightroom in Appetzer.
[00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:55.560]   Mobile is rapidly becoming--
[00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:59.320]   There's pros like, oh, when they're going to use Lightroom
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:00.960]   and they're going to use a desktop app.
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:04.560]   But really, most normal people, the photos are taken on the phone.
[00:40:04.560 --> 00:40:06.560]   They want to modify them on the phone,
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:07.760]   share them from the phone.
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:10.120]   And if you have a big camera, there
[00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:11.640]   are uploaders for Mac and Windows
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:15.600]   that you attach the card and it uploads them to these services, too.
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:16.280]   I'm OK.
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:19.080]   I'm going to admit something because I
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:22.840]   have a fancy camera, an extraordinarily fancy Leica lens.
[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:25.600]   Favorite picture I've ever taken in my life.
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:29.080]   I took the picture and then I copied it over to my phone
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:32.040]   and you snap-seed to make it a black and white.
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:35.000]   And I thought, well, this is just quick, quick and dirty.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.040]   And I'll go back and use Lightroom and do it right.
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:38.560]   I never went back.
[00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:40.760]   It's my favorite image ever.
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:43.160]   And it was done-- I don't want to admit it,
[00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:44.680]   but it was done in snap-seed.
[00:40:44.680 --> 00:40:45.560]   What's wrong with that?
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:46.360]   Why are you still that?
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:48.080]   No, yeah, what's wrong with that?
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:50.360]   Look, Uncle Leo, first of all, the best tech
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:51.520]   isn't always the best tech.
[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:54.000]   The best tech is what works for you and what's available.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.240]   There's people in third world countries
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:57.840]   with only a cell phone and they get by living the dream.
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:00.240]   Like I told you, this girl's running laps around me.
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:01.080]   Isn't that cool?
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:04.040]   And I tried to give-- I have a backup 70D because, you know,
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:05.280]   I'm stupid I buy two everything.
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:06.680]   I got a camera, love her to our camera.
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:07.280]   I don't even use it.
[00:41:07.280 --> 00:41:09.240]   I said, here, I'll give it to you so you can learn.
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:11.200]   And she's like, I wouldn't you know what to do with that?
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:11.840]   There's no point.
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:13.120]   I kept thinking I was going to buy it.
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:13.680]   She doesn't need it.
[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:14.400]   And I just never did.
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:15.160]   And so she just won't.
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:16.640]   She wouldn't even take one for free.
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.080]   She's like, I'm just going to keep using my phone.
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:20.240]   And I'm like, God bless you.
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:23.200]   So I'll show you the picture because this is my favorite
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:25.040]   picture ever, Lisa and her son.
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:26.600]   And it was a color image.
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:28.560]   The black and white, the smoothing, everything I did
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:31.480]   was all done in the phone.
[00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:35.240]   The picture was taken with an $8,000 lens, but the phone--
[00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:36.240]   I bought a-- I bought a--
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:37.720]   I had a hard one point.
[00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:40.400]   And I just set it up so that when I was speaking pictures
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:42.840]   with my SLR, we just use Wi-Fi to send them to my phone.
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:44.320]   And then my phone would do the syncing.
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:46.560]   This is the one reason why I'm still using an Android phone
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:48.960]   as opposed to iPhone, because I can use NFC to tap it
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.480]   to the Sony--
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:53.280]   the A7, which I use, I tap it to that.
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:56.160]   The NFC pairs, it copies all the photos over to the phone.
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:58.400]   I use Snapstream to modify it.
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:41:59.640]   Snapstream to modify it.
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:03.240]   And then upload it to Flickr or Google+,
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:04.200]   and I never went back.
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:06.800]   But the fact is, a lot of times people are frustrated,
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:07.920]   because they take so many pictures,
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:10.480]   and they have to go to the computer and fix it.
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:12.400]   This was shot raw.
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:14.240]   But everything was done on the phone.
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:15.040]   I'm horrible.
[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:16.520]   I'm over here doing my guy removes.
[00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:18.600]   Like I shoot with Mark D53.
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:19.640]   I take the SD card out.
[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:21.680]   I put it in the '70s, because that's wireless.
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:23.240]   And then I set it to my phone.
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:23.760]   OK, crazy.
[00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:24.440]   Yes, I do.
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:25.400]   I'm a horrible person.
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:25.880]   Well, why--
[00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:27.400]   I should just buy a Wi-Fi.
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:29.360]   Well, why can't you just see what Google does?
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:30.840]   I see that there are--
[00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:34.120]   there's link sharing built into the new apps, which
[00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:35.560]   makes it very easy.
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:38.600]   Excuse me, very easy, they say to share it with, obviously,
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:40.200]   Google+, and other social media.
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:44.920]   And you also can control privacy, which is very smart.
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:48.200]   Remove geo location and stuff like that.
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:49.800]   So I think that, yeah, you know what?
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:52.160]   I have a feeling that this will be--
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:55.880]   this is merely to get Google+'s photo stuff onto the phone,
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:56.560]   really.
[00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:57.320]   It's like snaps.
[00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:57.720]   Snaps, snaps, snaps.
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:58.840]   Another option.
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:42:59.840]   What's that?
[00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:00.520]   Just another way.
[00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:01.080]   Yeah.
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:01.720]   Yeah.
[00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:04.280]   I don't think it necessarily means anything bad for Google+.
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:06.920]   I think it's always good to have Google+ be the glue that
[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:07.880]   holds things together.
[00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:10.840]   And I think having photos be available someplace other
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:13.680]   than Google+ is good, because it's just more places.
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:17.160]   Google is also, according to the information Amir Friday,
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:20.840]   usually very, very good with his Google knowledge.
[00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:23.920]   He says that Google is developing a new operating system
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:28.320]   for the internet of things called Brillo, which is not
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:29.720]   a great name.
[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:31.400]   Maybe that's just a code name.
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:34.840]   It would be able to run on low-powered devices with as few
[00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:38.720]   as 64 or 32 megabytes of RAM.
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:41.120]   I remember when 8 megabytes was a lot on a PC,
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:46.920]   but I guess 64 and 32 is kind of minimum on modern stuff.
[00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:49.480]   So watch for that as well.
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:50.720]   You know, go ahead.
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:52.760]   Suddenly Android at home.
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:55.360]   Is that kind of-- you got to figure this is Android-based, right?
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:56.120]   Yeah.
[00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:59.280]   That's one of my guesses for this next I/O,
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:01.080]   is that we're going to see a lot more around
[00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:02.640]   just connected home in general.
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:05.960]   And I mean, a couple of years ago was Android at home.
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:08.480]   And we never really saw much.
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:10.360]   They ended up acquiring Nest.
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:11.800]   They have Dropcam now.
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:14.240]   So there's all these little pieces kind of falling into place.
[00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:16.000]   And now it's just a matter of Google
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.240]   doing what it needs to to kind of integrate it.
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:21.840]   And it looks like one assumption is that they're
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:25.080]   going to do kind of a lower-powered version of Android
[00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:25.960]   in order to do that.
[00:44:25.960 --> 00:44:27.880]   Friday in the information says it
[00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:31.440]   appears to be separate from the upcoming release of M,
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:33.600]   of Android's M version.
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:34.680]   So we may not hear about it.
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:37.480]   So I don't know if it's related to Android.
[00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:40.000]   You got to figure it's based on Android.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.400]   But remember, they acquired Nest.
[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:43.800]   Nest had its own kind of operating system.
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:45.160]   They've dropped cam as well.
[00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:47.960]   But Dropcam was interestingly integrated into Nest.
[00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:47.960]   Yeah.
[00:44:47.960 --> 00:44:49.200]   So I wonder if they just set up parallel--
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:50.360]   That's their I of T.
[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:52.640]   Yeah, parallel track for stuff that's
[00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:54.680]   happening inside of Nest.
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:58.880]   Somebody called me on the radio show today and said,
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:01.480]   you know, I've been thinking these new internet-connected
[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:03.200]   things like my locks.
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:05.720]   Schlage and Quicksett both make locks that are--
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:07.640]   you walk up to them and they open the door for you
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:08.640]   because they recognize your phone.
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:09.560]   I think it's Bluetooth.
[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:11.200]   I don't know if they're internet-connected.
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:13.640]   He said, do you think there's a security problem?
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:15.840]   And I said, yeah, there's a massive--
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:18.640]   get ready because the internet of things
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:22.600]   is already a horrible mess in security.
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:24.400]   We did a piece-- and if you haven't heard it yet,
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:26.680]   do listen to security now from this week.
[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:30.240]   Steve was talking about these keyless entry systems of fobs
[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:32.440]   that you use on your cars.
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:34.440]   Nick Bilton was the first to bring this to our attention
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:36.720]   in a New York Times article where he said he was standing
[00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:39.200]   outside his door of his house when he noticed kids getting
[00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:41.680]   one by one opening a door of every car all the way down
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:43.720]   the street, getting in, ransacking the car,
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:45.600]   and leaving these were all locked cars, including his own
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:46.480]   Prius.
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:49.360]   They all had key-- everything now has keyless entry.
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:52.080]   When I walk up to my car, I touch the handle.
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:53.080]   The door is unlocked.
[00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:54.880]   And I get in, then I press a button.
[00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:57.960]   There's no ignition key or anything like that.
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:45:59.280]   So Steve explained how it works.
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:03.440]   And apparently, they are all vulnerable.
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:10.360]   There's a $17 amplifier you can buy on eBay.
[00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:11.120]   And I'm not sure.
[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:12.520]   I might have misremembered this.
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:15.240]   I think you stand next to the car with this amplifier.
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:17.160]   And then-- no, I think it's the other way around.
[00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:19.120]   It's just next to the key fob with the amplifier.
[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:21.000]   And then your accomplice gets in the door.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.520]   The only security on these key fobs is proximity.
[00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:27.200]   That you have to be next to the car to get in.
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:30.880]   But if you could amplify it with this $17 amplifier,
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:33.680]   then anybody can just open.
[00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:36.640]   So let's say you go to a fancy restaurant.
[00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:38.560]   Somebody notices, hey, that's a nice Aston Martin
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:39.720]   you're driving there.
[00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:43.920]   He watches the valley park city, follows him,
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:47.800]   sees where the car is, puts the key fob in that box.
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:49.400]   His accomplice stands next to the box.
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:47:19.400]   D-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d
[00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:20.400]   It's a little metal thing.
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:22.200]   You can stick down in the window and you can pop it open.
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:24.320]   And talk about bad security.
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:25.720]   Front door locks.
[00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:27.800]   There are tools that'll unlock them.
[00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:30.200]   You can put-- have a key that says, do not copy.
[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:30.720]   Guess what?
[00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:31.320]   They'll copy it.
[00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:32.400]   You can copy it.
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:34.760]   And there was that app that you could actually
[00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:37.360]   take a picture of a key with a camera.
[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:38.200]   And make a key.
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:40.080]   And make a key out of the picture.
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:40.680]   So--
[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:42.080]   I'll tell you what.
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:44.720]   I'd rather somebody breaking my item, home, car,
[00:47:44.720 --> 00:47:47.640]   or whatever digitally than Jimmy My Lock bust my lock up.
[00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:48.400]   They stole myself in.
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:49.280]   I got a paid $200.
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:50.280]   You can do a lot of things.
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:53.080]   I'll open the door, come and meet my pimples, walk back out,
[00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:55.920]   going about your way.
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:57.000]   Well, that made me think.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.320]   Well, when did-- because I was thinking, well,
[00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:01.920]   I bet a Model T didn't have an ignition lock, right?
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:03.760]   You could have just stolen somebody's Model T.
[00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:04.880]   So we did a little research.
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:07.800]   And there was an article, a meta filter, from Popular Science.
[00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:11.760]   It turns out that ignition locks on cars
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:14.560]   didn't appear until 1949.
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:16.400]   And then I've thought about, well, your horse,
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:18.480]   who was keeping people from stealing your horse?
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:19.600]   Nobody.
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:23.000]   So it's only been since 1949 that you had the notion,
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.920]   even that you could lock a car.
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:28.520]   You didn't even have locks until 1949.
[00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:29.720]   It's honestly began in 1949.
[00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:31.560]   Honestly began in 1949.
[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:34.680]   So really, locks are just a suggestion,
[00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:38.480]   a societal indicator that, please, don't go in here.
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:39.640]   You're just trying to make it harder
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:41.240]   so that people don't bother.
[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:42.880]   That's really what it is.
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:43.680]   Well, this is hard.
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:45.920]   If you have to go to eBay, you have to buy a thing,
[00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:47.360]   you've got to stand next to the fob.
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:48.160]   It's too hard.
[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:50.920]   It's easier to--
[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:52.600]   - I would recommend one of these for your fault.
[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:54.960]   - Maybe it's location and a fingerprint scanner.
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:57.720]   Maybe it's location and there's some cars
[00:48:57.720 --> 00:48:58.920]   that have the pin on it.
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:00.560]   - It could be solved. - No one can.
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:01.880]   It could be solved.
[00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:04.520]   - Yes. - Again, no matter how you solve it,
[00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:05.600]   somebody's gonna break in.
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:06.440]   - Right.
[00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:07.440]   - You always smash the window.
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:08.440]   - If they really want to, right?
[00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:10.040]   And they can smash the window if they want
[00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:11.920]   and crawling through the window.
[00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:14.080]   I think like kind of what Jason Snow saying is,
[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:15.840]   you make it kind of hard so that somebody says,
[00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:17.040]   okay, I'm not gonna do this one.
[00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:17.960]   - You just want a speed bump.
[00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:18.800]   - The next one.
[00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:19.640]   - Yeah, I'll go to the next one.
[00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:20.480]   - Right.
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:21.320]   - I'll go down the bump. - A little speed bump.
[00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:22.280]   - Yeah.
[00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:23.960]   I always cracks me up when I go to New York City
[00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:25.520]   and people have signs in there when they're saying,
[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:26.880]   there's no radio inside.
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:29.320]   (laughing)
[00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:31.160]   - Nothing to see here.
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:33.880]   - Nothing to see. - Go steal it from the next guy.
[00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:35.040]   - Only time somebody broke in my car,
[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:36.920]   they saw my radar detector and I was so upset.
[00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:38.120]   I'm like, really?
[00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:39.760]   You broke in here for a radar detector?
[00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:41.880]   Like, why would you do that to me?
[00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:44.160]   I felt like now I'm about to get a new one
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:45.120]   and I was talking to the guys,
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:45.960]   they're like, oh, whatever you're going,
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:47.640]   I'm like, this might broke in my car and stole it.
[00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:48.760]   So of course now he's talking to me
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:50.640]   and the getting one that's built into the frame
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:51.680]   so nobody ever see it.
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:53.400]   And that's like quadruple the price.
[00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:56.000]   So I'm like, if somebody breaks my car again,
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.120]   I will freak out.
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:49:58.560]   'Cause I'm like, you can't steal the radio.
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:00.040]   Who steals radios anymore?
[00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:01.920]   But then apparently there's still people's airbags
[00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:02.760]   and stuff, I'm like--
[00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:03.880]   - You're stealing airbags, yeah.
[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:05.240]   - Yeah, I'm like, what?
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:07.080]   - You got that very steal to steal the airbags.
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:07.920]   - You got that very steal to steal the airbags.
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:08.760]   - Good money.
[00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:10.960]   Wow, I did not know that airbags were good money,
[00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:12.280]   so apparently they are.
[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:13.280]   - Man.
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:15.600]   (sighs)
[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:18.840]   - Android M, we will know more about that.
[00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:21.720]   Better fingerprint, this is ours Technica's,
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:24.840]   they call it their Google Tracker 2015.
[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:25.680]   - Android Marshmallow.
[00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:26.600]   - Marshmallow, what is M?
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:28.400]   It's gonna be something, some dessert.
[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:31.480]   Marang, Marshmallow, Marzapan.
[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:33.160]   No, it won't be Marzapan.
[00:50:33.160 --> 00:50:34.360]   Although I like Marzapan.
[00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:35.200]   - If only.
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:36.040]   - I'm the only one.
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:40.840]   Better fingerprint system that's built into the operating system.
[00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:43.200]   Android Pay, Google Hangouts gets smarter,
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:46.400]   Google Calendar, makes your agenda for you.
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:47.240]   - No, thank you.
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:49.000]   (laughs)
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:50.840]   - And this is all a lot of guessing,
[00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:53.120]   by the way, like educated guests coming from
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:54.120]   Ronamadio.
[00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:54.960]   - Ron's?
[00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:56.520]   - You know Ron, Ron's talking about Android.
[00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:58.760]   - He's probably going to be on this week's,
[00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:00.480]   this week in Google, actually.
[00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:02.280]   - So he's just making crap up here.
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:04.440]   - But he's, you know, he's reading the tea leaves.
[00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:06.600]   He's very good at analyzing these things.
[00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:08.080]   - You're in your house.
[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:10.080]   - As Chromecast lived up to its promise,
[00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:11.320]   it's been, how long has it been at?
[00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:12.520]   One year, two years.
[00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:14.360]   - Two years at this point.
[00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:16.920]   - I feel like by now there'd be a broader ecosystem though,
[00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:18.280]   right?
[00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:19.960]   - I feel like it's proven itself,
[00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:22.200]   but you know, how adopted is it?
[00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:23.760]   I guess I don't know the actual numbers.
[00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:24.600]   I love it.
[00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:25.440]   - Yeah, I use it all the time,
[00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:27.560]   but I'm kind of a Google fanatic, so.
[00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:28.480]   - Yeah, me too.
[00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:31.840]   - I think it was best to be on this side.
[00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:33.320]   - That's the best thing about it.
[00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:34.960]   - Go ahead, go ahead, Jason.
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:35.800]   - Sorry, go ahead, go ahead.
[00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:38.640]   - Yeah, so I just say the best thing about,
[00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:41.640]   the best thing about that I like about Chromecast
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:43.600]   is where you can put it on a screen,
[00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:44.960]   like especially like in the office
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:49.240]   or, and you can leave it on and it will flip pictures
[00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:51.840]   or you can set it up there to pull like news headlines
[00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:55.040]   and photos and, you know, all kinds of stuff.
[00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:59.640]   So it's got the best sleep state of any of the--
[00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:01.160]   - I do, I love it.
[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:02.440]   - The device is out there.
[00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:04.280]   - I have my slideshow on there, it's great.
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:06.120]   - Yeah, and then you can, it has that thing where,
[00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:09.720]   even if you're not connected, it has a little pin there
[00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:12.120]   where you can say, hey, here's what you do to, you know,
[00:52:12.120 --> 00:52:14.840]   cast something up to this device.
[00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:16.720]   I think it's a great shared,
[00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:20.000]   it's the best sort of shared screen, you know,
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.760]   cord cutting kind of device that's out there.
[00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:25.400]   And I love Apple TV too, it's like, you know,
[00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:27.520]   of all the Apple products, I'm probably the happiest,
[00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:29.160]   I'm maybe I'm like the only person on earth,
[00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:31.520]   but there's like happiest with Apple TV, but I mean,
[00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:34.600]   anymore now you can put those two devices on a TV
[00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:36.440]   and, you know, have an amazing experience
[00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:39.040]   with a lot of content and a lot of capabilities of,
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:42.320]   you know, transferring things from mobile devices
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:44.560]   to your screen and all that.
[00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:47.080]   So I think both of them are, you know,
[00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:48.720]   I think under-appreciated.
[00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:50.600]   - We're not alone, Jason, you're not alone.
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:52.720]   - You like it, Owen, JJ Stone?
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:56.200]   - I got Apple TVs in every room, they got me.
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:57.800]   - They got you, they on you.
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:52:59.360]   - It's solid, it's solid.
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:02.480]   - That's 'cause all your Dora the Explorer videos are on there.
[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:03.880]   - You know why I like it?
[00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:05.080]   Because my daughter can use it
[00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:06.560]   and she doesn't have to ask me anything.
[00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:08.240]   It just works and it's easy.
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:10.920]   When she's on her iPad and she wants to beam something,
[00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:12.560]   vice versa, like it's--
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:14.920]   - Airplay works very nicely, it just works.
[00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:16.000]   So, I like it.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.040]   - Yeah.
[00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:21.120]   We're going to add Chromecast to our web-based player.
[00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:23.880]   We got a new website which we'll be rolling out in about,
[00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:25.840]   I don't know, two weeks, something like that.
[00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:28.160]   It's ready, it's done, it's cooked.
[00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:31.160]   We're just doing a few behind the scenes wiring.
[00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:34.560]   Unfortunately, so we're using it,
[00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:36.160]   we're going to use a new player, we use JW player,
[00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:37.840]   which I know a lot of people have used before.
[00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:40.600]   I think we decided that's the best player to use.
[00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:42.040]   And we're paying for the next tier up
[00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:43.240]   that gives you Chromecast support.
[00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:44.440]   So, if you're watching on the web,
[00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:45.560]   there should be a little Chromecast button,
[00:53:45.560 --> 00:53:47.800]   you can watch on your big screen TV.
[00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:52.800]   Unfortunately, Jeff Niebles did all the coding and he's gone.
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:55.800]   So, I don't know if we're actually going to be able
[00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:58.560]   to figure out how this works,
[00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:02.120]   but I believe somebody will figure it out.
[00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:04.200]   Do you know how to use JW player?
[00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:05.320]   Anybody?
[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:06.760]   - Yeah, cricket.
[00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:07.600]   Cricket.
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:10.400]   (laughing)
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:11.400]   - Wait, were we talking?
[00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:12.240]   What happened?
[00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:14.600]   (laughing)
[00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:16.120]   - I thought there was another J on the show,
[00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:17.520]   I thought you'd go to the first one.
[00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:19.800]   - Yeah, Niebles went to a Mircak, of course, right?
[00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:20.880]   He went to work for Mircak,
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:23.280]   because he became like the number five Mircak.
[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:27.840]   Like it's him and Madonna, and like so naturally they hired him.
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:29.560]   - Mirr, Mirr, Mirr.
[00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:31.840]   - They tried to hire Madonna, that didn't go very far.
[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:33.880]   - She was not interested in doing this dev for them,
[00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:35.480]   but Jeff was.
[00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:37.760]   Google Maps will be rolling out, and this is known,
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:39.640]   this is a fact, this is not for Google I/O,
[00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:42.600]   this is now, Google Maps rolls out traffic alerts
[00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:44.400]   and alternate routes, this is nice.
[00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:45.560]   - Yeah, I got this the other day.
[00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:46.400]   - It's nice.
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:47.240]   - That's great.
[00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:49.400]   - It's in ways, which Google owns, right?
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:51.240]   - Yeah, they've been integrating ways
[00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:53.600]   into kind of the Maps experience for a while.
[00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:56.200]   This is just a little bit more refinement in the Maps app.
[00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:58.480]   - So what's different, correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:00.720]   you used to get warned, well it's gonna take you
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:03.920]   a little extra time when you first did the navigation.
[00:55:03.920 --> 00:55:05.840]   But now as you drive, it will say,
[00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:08.920]   uh oh, you know, reroute, just like Way's did.
[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:12.760]   - Yeah, but although I will say I've had it pop that up
[00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:13.760]   on me already.
[00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:14.600]   - Anyway.
[00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:17.440]   - Anyways, it's just, the way it happened before,
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:21.560]   it was a little bit easier for me to ignore or not see
[00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:22.680]   or not hear.
[00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:23.680]   - I mean, you put colors on this screen.
[00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:25.480]   - Now it's kind of integrated a little bit better
[00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:27.080]   and it makes it color obvious.
[00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:28.760]   - At least for a year, colors on this screen too.
[00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:29.600]   - Yeah, those are great.
[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:31.040]   - You have a three-year yellow that tell you what traffic
[00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:32.280]   is very useful.
[00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:33.480]   - That's a horrible product,
[00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:34.480]   I don't know what you guys are talking about.
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:35.320]   - What?
[00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:36.840]   - You hate Google Maps?
[00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:38.760]   - I'm actually really jealous of it
[00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:41.040]   and I wish that I had an Android phone all the time.
[00:55:41.040 --> 00:55:42.120]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:42.960]   - It's amazing.
[00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:44.040]   Like it works with my car now too,
[00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:45.840]   like you could put that map on my car screen.
[00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:46.680]   - Yeah.
[00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:48.720]   - And the Hyundai Nav, you can use that.
[00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:49.560]   - I'm done.
[00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:51.160]   So your Hyundai has car as Android Play
[00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:52.840]   or whatever it's called, Android Car?
[00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:55.880]   - Yeah, they promised me Apple connectivity,
[00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:56.680]   but that never happened,
[00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:58.160]   but Android jumped right in there
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:00.080]   and now they're promoting all Android stuff.
[00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:01.560]   And I'm like, really?
[00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:04.680]   - I was, you know, I have built in as many,
[00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:06.480]   you know, people have built in Nav,
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:08.160]   but that has to all happen on the car
[00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:09.640]   and the car doesn't have much of a processor
[00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:10.480]   and everything.
[00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:11.840]   - It just makes it so much more sense to use
[00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:13.200]   the network to use the--
[00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:15.600]   - And it sounds silly, but you have to upgrade,
[00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:17.560]   like every time I take my car for service,
[00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:18.920]   they ask me if I wanna upgrade the maps
[00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:21.600]   because there have been times when the car doesn't know
[00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:25.120]   exactly and I can call in and on the phone thing now,
[00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:27.080]   but I don't wanna listen to directions over the phone.
[00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:29.960]   I just wanted to work on my screen that I have
[00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:31.360]   so I can plug my phone into it
[00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:32.880]   and have to do it over the internet,
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:33.720]   like it's supposed to.
[00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:34.560]   - You can call?
[00:56:34.560 --> 00:56:36.320]   You can call and get directions.
[00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:38.480]   - They've got that, like, on-star.
[00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:39.320]   Hyundai has on-star.
[00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:40.360]   - Oh, you press it on-star.
[00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:42.560]   - So I call them when the map doesn't come up,
[00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:44.000]   it automatically calls them,
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:44.840]   then they come down and say,
[00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:45.680]   "Oh, you're gonna make a right."
[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:47.080]   I'm like, "Get off the phone, Lucy.
[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:49.080]   "I'm just gonna put my phone on the dashboard
[00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:49.920]   "and keep it moving.
[00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:51.960]   "I don't have time to listen to you,
[00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:52.800]   "till I'm gonna have to get there."
[00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:56.480]   - That's gotta be a job that's not long for this world.
[00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:57.960]   - It is, people like concierge,
[00:56:57.960 --> 00:56:59.320]   and some people like having their hands out.
[00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:00.920]   - They want it. - People are babies.
[00:57:00.920 --> 00:57:03.040]   - They want someone to tell them what to do.
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:04.520]   "Oh, wait, where's the best restaurant?"
[00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:07.760]   I can't ask Siri, I wanna ask you a person.
[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:08.680]   - Right.
[00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:10.120]   - So, you know.
[00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:13.880]   - Then the person asks Siri and that's how that works.
[00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:16.560]   - I don't know, Google Maps on the iPhone is pretty great,
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:19.120]   although I have a problem with their coloring thing
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:21.240]   because if you're a red, green colored line,
[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:22.560]   like some of us are,
[00:57:22.560 --> 00:57:25.600]   it's very hard to tell whether the traffic is good or bad.
[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:27.840]   And Apple at least does that part right in there
[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:29.400]   is where it's a dotted red line,
[00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:31.880]   it's much easier to see, so hopefully Google--
[00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:33.240]   - They're thinking accessibility.
[00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:34.480]   Has Apple Maps, is that okay?
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:35.480]   Is it all better now?
[00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:36.320]   - It depends on where you are.
[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:38.680]   I have been misled by Apple Maps and Google Maps.
[00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:40.120]   - Every map can mislead you.
[00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:42.080]   - And I've also had good experiences with both of them.
[00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:45.040]   I think in San Francisco area here,
[00:57:45.040 --> 00:57:46.200]   Apple Maps is great.
[00:57:46.200 --> 00:57:47.880]   I hear horror stories about other places
[00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:50.240]   'cause I think Apple's really done a good job
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:51.080]   like where it's employed.
[00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:52.320]   - In their backyard, yeah.
[00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:54.800]   - And then that's where I live, so it's okay for me.
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:57.360]   - That does worry me a little bit about autonomous vehicles
[00:57:57.360 --> 00:57:59.720]   is if they're following the Google Maps
[00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:04.400]   and you don't even drive off a bridge,
[00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:05.480]   you're not gonna drive off of it.
[00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:07.240]   See, why are you gonna get all crazy?
[00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:08.080]   - No.
[00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:09.880]   - But in the works, the map can do a bustle up--
[00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:11.600]   - Did you read that story about the couple
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:16.360]   who drove off, they drove on to a long, disused overpass
[00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:19.280]   because their GPS told them to.
[00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:22.200]   They drove through like 20 signs and said, "Stop, turn back.
[00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:23.040]   Go away."
[00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:25.080]   - And if your GPS told you to jump off a bridge,
[00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:26.960]   would you apparently-- - Apparently.
[00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:29.800]   - So, I mean, come on, just turn it down.
[00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:30.640]   That's rhetoric.
[00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:32.640]   Do not, wait a minute, what's gonna happen?
[00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:34.560]   What's the autonomous vehicle gonna do?
[00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:35.880]   Is it gonna-- - It's gonna stop
[00:58:35.880 --> 00:58:37.680]   because there's sensors and things on your car
[00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:39.480]   that tell you there's nothing there.
[00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:40.760]   - It's gonna be very-- - It's not gonna stop--
[00:58:40.760 --> 00:58:41.880]   - It's gonna be like when my segue,
[00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:43.240]   if I take one foot off the segue,
[00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:44.520]   it starts going around in circles
[00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:45.880]   'cause it doesn't know what to do.
[00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:47.640]   - My car right now has got the lane departure,
[00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:49.200]   it's got the adaptive cruise control
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:51.960]   where it slows down and speeds up and it works adequate.
[00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:53.360]   It freaked me off like the first two weeks,
[00:58:53.360 --> 00:58:55.560]   but by that time, technology will be taken care of you.
[00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:57.040]   You're not gonna drive off a bridge
[00:58:57.040 --> 00:58:58.400]   and if you do, your family will still
[00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:00.040]   gonna pay a little automatic.
[00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:01.400]   - Okay, good.
[00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:02.520]   As long as there's something--
[00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:03.480]   - Yeah, I agree.
[00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:05.200]   They'll be override systems.
[00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:06.920]   They'll be systems that will, you know,
[00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:10.840]   the vehicle will have its own sensors as I was saying.
[00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:12.680]   - Jason says that wasn't a true story,
[00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:13.760]   it was in the office.
[00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:15.480]   No, I thought it was, (laughs)
[00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:18.840]   I do confuse often fictional TV shows with real life,
[00:59:18.840 --> 00:59:21.640]   but I do believe I saw an actual news story
[00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:26.320]   about a couple that, but you know, could be, who knows?
[00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:28.720]   We're gonna take a break, come back with more.
[00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:29.720]   Jason Heiner is here.
[00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:33.280]   I gotta find out what the next chapter is in your book.
[00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:35.640]   - Yeah, happy to talk about it.
[00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:37.640]   - Yeah, all right, well, when we get back, we'll do that.
[00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:38.960]   At Jason Heiner on the Twitter,
[00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:41.160]   you'll find him on CBS Interactive.
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:45.200]   Jason Snell's here, he's from sixcolors.com,
[00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:48.600]   and The Incompable, anything big going on in your world?
[00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:52.400]   - Not a lot, did that David Letterman documentary thing?
[00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:54.200]   - Yeah, I still have a big game to listen to that.
[00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:55.040]   - Yeah, listen to that, it's good.
[00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:56.000]   - Did you watch the last show?
[00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:57.000]   - I did.
[00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:58.360]   - Was it, did it live up to your expectations?
[00:59:58.360 --> 01:00:00.480]   - It was good, it was not teary or anything like that.
[01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:01.320]   - I don't like that.
[01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:02.600]   - And they did an amazing montage over the,
[01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:04.080]   over Foo Fighters playing Everlong.
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:06.320]   They did this insane montage that their producers
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:08.000]   were putting together for like six months.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.960]   - It was a lot of images, it went too fast,
[01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:10.800]   I couldn't see it.
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:13.520]   - The next day a guy on Facebook posted an annotation,
[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:15.000]   it had screenshots of every single thing
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.120]   and what all of them were shots of.
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:19.000]   - Of course, they knew somebody would do that.
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.160]   - Yeah, yeah, pretty cool, thanks internet.
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:24.880]   - Listen to The Incompable then, The Farewell.
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:25.880]   - Yeah, it's called Monkey Cam,
[01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:27.720]   and it was my, like, yeah, farewell to the--
[01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:29.520]   - #ThankYouDave.
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:33.680]   - And not named Jason, Owen JJ Stone,
[01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:36.240]   he could be at a pool party right now
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:38.080]   with some beautiful women.
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:40.480]   - Picture me in the prison in Superman's world,
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:41.840]   I'm under the rest.
[01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:43.240]   - I need to just, I wanna be here.
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:44.560]   - There's guilty.
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:45.560]   - Right, there they go.
[01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:50.040]   Somebody break this glass and send me off to another land.
[01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:51.360]   - No, you got another hour.
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:53.280]   - Nailed before JJ.
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:56.400]   - Somebody help me, help me.
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:59.520]   - Did you at least give the girls the link to the live show
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:02.120]   so they could watch and marvel at you?
[01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:04.120]   - Here's the thing about nerd them, okay?
[01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:05.400]   I'm trying to see them cool,
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:06.760]   and again, try and explain it,
[01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:10.440]   I'm sitting on here with a very contrasting panel,
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:11.880]   does not help me in my situation.
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:13.360]   - No, all you gotta say, all you gotta say is,
[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:16.240]   I gotta go be on this TV thing, I'll be back.
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:18.680]   - See, look, I'm waiting to, they're getting drunk now,
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:20.000]   this is prep work for me.
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:21.440]   I had to sit there and be cute for two hours,
[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:22.320]   now I'm just gonna be drunk,
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:24.400]   my time's gonna back up, everybody's so unstoppable.
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:25.880]   - All right, Zod.
[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:27.680]   We'll be back with more in just a moment,
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:28.840]   our show brought to you by--
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:29.680]   (Zod laughs)
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:30.760]   - He's trapped.
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:36.400]   Stamps.com, why would you ever go to the post office
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:38.520]   when Stamps.com is in this world,

[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:46.640]   but it's more than using your own computer
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:49.200]   and printer to buy and print US postage.

[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:01.880]   that you can't get at the post office,
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:04.320]   you can import addresses from all your address books,
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:07.560]   use cost codes to track postage spending by customer,
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:10.560]   get automatic address verification.
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:11.960]   You could not get better than this,
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:14.360]   he automatically prints out certified mail return receipts,
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:16.080]   international customs forms,
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:19.840]   it will send an email to the certified mail recipient
[01:02:19.840 --> 01:02:21.960]   saying your package is on the way,
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:22.920]   just goes on and on.

[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:15.480]   I don't know what I'm gonna do.
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:16.840]   Would you write some jokes?
[01:03:16.840 --> 01:03:17.840]   - You're gonna make a movie?
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:22.640]   - Nah, I need, oh and you gotta write me some jokes.
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:24.360]   - Uncle Leo, I'm pretty sure after you get
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:25.520]   a talk of for 15 minutes
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:28.000]   on uncontrolled environment, hilarity will ensue.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.720]   - Ah, you gotta give me some D.W.B jokes.
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:31.560]   - I hope you out.
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:33.080]   - That'll go over well.
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:34.440]   (laughing)
[01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:36.800]   Jason. - Do you look at take jokes?
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:40.320]   - Jason, tell us about the next chapter in that,
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:42.400]   'cause who was the last person you did,
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:43.800]   it was Tom Merritt, right?
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:45.960]   - Yeah, and then the one we just released
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:50.640]   after Tom, chapter five was Veronica Belmont.
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:52.560]   - Oh.
[01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:53.680]   - Yeah, excellent.
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:58.680]   So Veronica, who's so humble and so self-effacing,
[01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:01.600]   has done so many amazing things
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:06.600]   and has pretty much been on independent,
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:11.720]   primarily independent since she was in her mid 20s.
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:15.440]   And now she's kind of fully independent,
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:18.440]   doing lots of different gigs in demand
[01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:21.520]   and is currently has about,
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:22.440]   as we talk about in the chapter,
[01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:26.480]   about five different TV projects that she's kind of pitching
[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:30.960]   or in talks about and she's--
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:33.040]   - She's doing a new show in Engagit, right?
[01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:34.480]   - And she is doing a new show in Gagit.
[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:35.320]   - Ask Veronica.
[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:37.640]   - Doesn't include, yeah, Ask Veronica.
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:41.080]   That doesn't include the Engagit show.
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:46.080]   So she writes, she can host, she's hilarious.
[01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:53.200]   And so, she's such a talent and has really,
[01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:57.400]   I think the example, one of the things the book
[01:04:57.400 --> 01:04:59.880]   is really about, which is that the future of work
[01:04:59.880 --> 01:05:01.280]   is a lot more entrepreneurial
[01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:03.400]   and people having to make work
[01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:07.000]   and as much as fine work and have people
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.960]   come in and offering you work.
[01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:12.280]   And it's kind of a combination of all those things.
[01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:13.800]   And she's a perfect example of that.
[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:15.760]   She's a perfect example of kind of what we're talking about
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:17.600]   in the book and what we're hoping
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:19.040]   that people get out of the book,
[01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:21.760]   which is ultimately figuring out ways
[01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:24.720]   to deal with the future where they may not have
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:28.040]   just the one full-time job for a long time
[01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:29.840]   where they may have multiple gigs,
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:31.240]   where they may have to kind of hustle
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:34.200]   and have to put a career together
[01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:37.960]   based on all kinds of different gigs
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:40.920]   and different opportunities and making opportunities
[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:42.000]   as well as finding them.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.920]   And so, Veronica, she's such an amazing person
[01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:48.280]   and such a cool person.
[01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:51.480]   And so she's great to talk to
[01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:54.800]   and just a good storyteller in her own right.
[01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:57.800]   So she kind of made it easy with this chapter.
[01:05:57.800 --> 01:05:59.640]   And I hope everybody will read it.
[01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:03.160]   It'll be available for free for a couple more weeks.
[01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:05.720]   We release each chapter as we're done with them.
[01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:07.360]   We release them for free on the internet
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:10.400]   for a few weeks until the next chapter comes out.
[01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:13.000]   And then the book's also available for pre-order.
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.320]   The whole thing will be released
[01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:16.520]   in the second half of the year.
[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:18.960]   There's a picture for the Buzzat Lad reunion
[01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:23.360]   with Amalie and Tom and Veronica and Tall Guy.
[01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:24.200]   Jason Hill.
[01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:25.040]   Hey, I made it.
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:26.600]   You made it into the book.
[01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:28.440]   So this is really cool.
[01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:29.280]   So they're writing the book.
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:31.560]   The book will be a book that you can buy,
[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:33.960]   but you can get only one chapter at a time,
[01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:36.880]   the current chapter, follow thegeeksbook.com.
[01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:39.560]   And this is the fifth chapter of Veronica Belmont.
[01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:43.480]   And you can give your input on sort of your insights
[01:06:43.480 --> 01:06:47.040]   and your feedback on what you think is sort of influential
[01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:49.560]   or important about each of these folks too.
[01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:52.720]   And the best comments, the best insights
[01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:55.280]   we're gonna publish at the end of each chapter
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:56.920]   in the book and the final version of the book.
[01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:57.840]   There she is with Ryan.
[01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:00.560]   Her husband, we love Ryan Block, of course.
[01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:03.080]   I remember Ryan telling me, he said,
[01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:06.480]   "I am way in way over my head with Veronica.
[01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:08.320]   She's way above my pay grade,
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:10.360]   and I'm gonna do everything I can to keep her happy."
[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:11.800]   They're adorable couple.
[01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:14.200]   And I'm just really happy for both of them.
[01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:15.720]   Good, I will read this.
[01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:16.640]   I already learned something.
[01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:19.520]   I did not know that Veronica's mom
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:23.400]   was a marketing director at Coleco, Troy Company.
[01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:24.480]   Now that's cool.
[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:25.560]   - Yes. - Yes.
[01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:27.400]   - Her mom is awesome.
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:28.240]   - Yeah. - The mom is.
[01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:29.080]   - Yeah, looks like he interviewed her.
[01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:29.920]   So that's great.
[01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:30.800]   - We did. - Yeah.
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:31.760]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:34.760]   - Follow thegeeksbook.com.
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:37.960]   If you're a champion. - Yes, indeed.
[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:40.520]   And the next chapter, chapter six,
[01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:44.000]   is really interesting too.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:44.840]   So.
[01:07:44.840 --> 01:07:46.640]   - Anybody we know?
[01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:48.360]   It's all been somebody we know.
[01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:49.200]   (laughs)
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:52.600]   - It has, I say, because we, right,
[01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:54.040]   we're both looking for the same kind of people,
[01:07:54.040 --> 01:07:57.640]   right, influential tech media, you know, kind of folks.
[01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:59.120]   I'd say all but--
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:01.960]   - It just shows you have excellent taste.
[01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:02.840]   - Thank you, thank you.
[01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:05.200]   And so you, vice versa. - Thank you.
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:08.600]   - All but a few are people that are gonna be familiar.
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:10.480]   I'd say maybe all but two or three
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:14.720]   are people that the Twit Army will be very familiar with.
[01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:19.720]   The next one, I would say the Twit Army will be familiar with,
[01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:23.120]   but, you know, more maybe tangentially,
[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:25.120]   but the next one is gonna be, you know,
[01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:27.280]   really unique and special too.
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:29.440]   They all, like they're like your kids now.
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:32.120]   You know, like I love all of them so much, you know?
[01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:33.520]   So, yeah.
[01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:38.960]   - Thanks a lot, United States Senate.
[01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:41.400]   Well done.
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:43.760]   You remember the, we mentioned that the House of Representatives
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:45.760]   had passed by a strong margin,
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:51.720]   a bill scrapping the NSA's bulk collection of phone data,
[01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:54.760]   but of course, you know, in the way it works,
[01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:56.600]   as I remember from, I think,
[01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:58.560]   I'm just a bill on Capitol Hill.
[01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:01.240]   I believe that after the House passes it,
[01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:04.480]   then the Senate must pass its version
[01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:09.480]   and something to do with cloture and super majorities they didn't.
[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:13.040]   And then they went home for the Memorial Day holiday.
[01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:17.080]   Little credit to Rand Paul who filibustered
[01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:20.320]   to prevent the renewal of the Patriot Act.
[01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:22.240]   All of this kind of goes back to the Patriot Act,
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:24.200]   Section 215 of the Patriot Act,
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:27.320]   allows the mess of what Rand Paul.
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:29.600]   - Because when you look at that,
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:32.000]   it's just the most childish in the country.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:32.840]   People don't understand,
[01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:35.440]   these politicians get tons of money from lobbyists.
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:37.040]   They don't care about you as an individual,
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:38.600]   all they care about is money and power.
[01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:39.600]   And it is just silly.
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:41.080]   Rand Paul sitting there and he's like,
[01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:44.240]   I object, and the guy says, January 5th, I object,
[01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:48.280]   January 4th, I object, January 3rd, I object, January 7th.
[01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:49.120]   Hate the guy. - I thought the guy
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:50.040]   said, hate the guy. - Hate the guy.
[01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:51.040]   Hate the guy. - The guy, my friend.
[01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:52.200]   - The senator from Mexico is like,
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:53.080]   well, can I object this time?
[01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:54.440]   So it's not just Rand Paul saying,
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:55.800]   he's the only person who objects like,
[01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:58.520]   is there playing a game and it's with people's lives
[01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:00.480]   and information and they do it with everything.
[01:10:00.480 --> 01:10:02.040]   And it's so insane to me to be upset.
[01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:03.880]   And I'm gonna shut up now because I'm angry about it.
[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:06.520]   Continue. - I may have misunderstood this,
[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:08.760]   but I thought that the point was
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:11.680]   to keep the Patriot Act from being renewed,
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:13.600]   it expires June 1st, right?
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:16.440]   And so he wanted to keep the vote off,
[01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:18.840]   put the vote off until recess.
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:20.760]   - Yes, and extend it. - Now.
[01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:22.040]   - To extend, right.
[01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:24.040]   'Cause it has to be extended by vote.
[01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:25.360]   So they didn't.
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:26.540]   So good news, bad news.
[01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:30.820]   They did say, well, forget that mass collection stuff,
[01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:33.220]   section 215, but we still have some hope
[01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:35.760]   because they're gonna come back just a few hours.
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:38.680]   Mitch McConnell says, we're gonna have like three hours
[01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:41.200]   on May 31st to extend the Patriot Act.
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:42.960]   He says, he's the leader of the Senate,
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:45.520]   we should extend it to protect our security.
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:48.320]   I think a lot of us believe that the Patriot Act
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:50.660]   does nothing to protect our security,
[01:10:50.660 --> 01:10:52.980]   but does a lot to impinge on our privacy.
[01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:55.420]   - The guy recently admitted that.
[01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:58.920]   They recently admitted that no this week,
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:02.360]   they admitted that no, oh boy,
[01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:03.760]   I'm trying to pull it out here.
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:08.240]   - There's been no successful prosecution of a terrorist,
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:11.200]   no successful thwarting of a terrorist plot,
[01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:14.040]   but they're getting everything they ever wanted
[01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:16.960]   about all of us, just in case.
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:19.400]   The whole point of the mass collection and phone data
[01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:20.280]   is they've got it.
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:22.080]   And now if it's down the road,
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:23.920]   they wanna investigate you, they got it.
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:28.880]   Yeah, I mean, it's just gotten so out of hand,
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:30.000]   so out of hand.
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:35.000]   And so it's one of those things that it's time, right?
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.360]   It's time to peel it back.
[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:38.500]   - I feel like that there's in the United States,
[01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:40.240]   there's kind of a, at this point,
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:43.960]   a sense that maybe the Patriot Act went too far.
[01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:46.520]   Look, nobody wants to be the person that passed
[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:47.920]   or didn't pass a bill,
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:50.400]   then there's a terrorist attack the next day.
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:53.200]   But I don't think that's the risk,
[01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:55.760]   but I do feel like people have feel like there's just,
[01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:57.440]   the NSA has gone way too far.
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:11:59.200]   - Well, I think the understanding these days
[01:11:59.200 --> 01:12:02.800]   is that a lot of the provisions in the Patriot Act,
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:04.840]   the people who voted for the Patriot Act
[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:05.840]   right after the 9/11 attacks--
[01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:06.760]   - We were scared.
[01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:09.240]   - Were not, well, and they weren't entirely aware
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:10.640]   of everything that was in there,
[01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:12.200]   which again, that is their job,
[01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:14.640]   but it happened so fast that I think they even complained.
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:17.720]   They didn't get a chance to really investigate
[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:18.560]   everything that was in there.
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:20.280]   And then of course in the years since then,
[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:22.720]   we've understood that the way some of those provisions
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:24.280]   have been written have been taken very broadly
[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:26.400]   to do some things that at the time,
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:28.840]   would we have signed up for that or not?
[01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:31.480]   Maybe if we were scared in the aftermath of the attack,
[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:34.280]   but time has passed down, we've had 15 years
[01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:36.120]   or 14 years to think about this.
[01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:39.720]   And it's interesting that some people are saying,
[01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:42.000]   "Look, we just can't do a blanket revision of this.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.560]   "We need to talk about this stuff."
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:46.600]   - The ACLU said the Senate is in gridlock,
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:48.520]   but the tides are shifting.
[01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:50.560]   For the first time a majority of senators took a stand,
[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:52.960]   it was 57, they needed 60 votes,
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:55.720]   took a stand against simply rubber stamping provisions
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:59.280]   of the Patriot Act that had been used to spy on Americans.
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:02.120]   Well, it's not over, May 31st, they come back.
[01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:04.800]   - Well, so much is intractable in our government right now
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:06.520]   because the parties just don't want to work together.
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:08.440]   What's fascinating about this is that it's not
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:09.960]   breaking down on a pretty large lines.
[01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:12.680]   This is a fascinating, it's a worldview thing
[01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:15.120]   where you've got people like Rand Paul saying
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:18.480]   that this is ridiculous and people like Diane Feinstein
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:20.960]   saying, "No, no, we need all of these provisions in there."
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:23.080]   And so you've got things that are not attached
[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:25.120]   to party lines, it's fascinating.
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:26.520]   - Yeah, she's a Democrat, he's a Republican.
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:27.360]   - Exactly.
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:28.680]   - But he's a libertarian Republican.
[01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:31.000]   I think feels quite rightly that the government
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.720]   doesn't have the right to all this.
[01:13:32.720 --> 01:13:33.800]   It's a mystery.
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:35.960]   - I'm encouraged that they're even debating it, honestly,
[01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:37.360]   because I had sort of given up hope on it.
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:39.800]   - Well, of course, we know that the sixth district court
[01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:42.640]   had overturned the legality of section 215
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:44.560]   in the mass collection of phone records.
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:45.720]   That will be appealed.
[01:13:45.720 --> 01:13:47.360]   So there's a lot of fronts where this is starting
[01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:48.680]   to be cut off.
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:51.400]   - I feel like this is why I live a ninja lifestyle.
[01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:52.240]   (laughing)
[01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:53.080]   - Yeah.
[01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:54.840]   - This is why my driver's license,
[01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:55.680]   I can straighten my driver's license.
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:59.720]   - If I were in the NSA, could I look you up
[01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:01.400]   and figure out everything you've been up to?
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:02.320]   - Could you find me?
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:03.160]   - Yeah.
[01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:04.320]   - You'd have to work to find me.
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:05.520]   My cell phone's not even in my name.
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:07.400]   - You don't think the NSA could do it?
[01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:10.200]   - Ah, it's the NSA.
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:11.040]   I guess the good thing.
[01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:12.120]   - I know everything.
[01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:13.280]   - Well, who are you afraid of?
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:14.880]   Is it Google or the NSA?
[01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:16.720]   - I'm just afraid maybe I messed up,
[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:18.000]   make a mistake one day somebody.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:18.840]   - It's a long shark.
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:20.600]   - You're worried about a long shark.
[01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:22.920]   - Look, all I know is who would have rested for the wrong.
[01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:25.280]   Things anymore, people are gonna go for no reason.
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:26.440]   Bad stuff happens to people.
[01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:28.520]   Like I said, I've been pulled over on an average
[01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:31.600]   every 15 days since January 1st.
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:32.840]   And I don't know what's going on.
[01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:33.680]   I just have bad luck.
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:36.320]   - Well, you're DWP, my friend.
[01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:37.200]   - You've been pulled over,
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:40.040]   so you've been pulled over like eight times in 2015?
[01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:42.640]   - Seven times, it's average every 15 days right now.
[01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:43.480]   - Because you're black.
[01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:44.320]   - For average.
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:45.160]   - Yeah.
[01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:46.000]   - Because you're an African American.
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.200]   - I've gotten one ticket out of those seven times.
[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:51.360]   Every other time I get let go of the warning.
[01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:54.000]   So basically it is one of the stop me, run my stuff,
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:55.640]   make sure I wasn't a criminal or,
[01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:57.200]   you know, like they, and they asked questions like,
[01:14:57.200 --> 01:14:58.200]   it's so obvious.
[01:14:58.200 --> 01:14:59.280]   Oh, what's in the bag?
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:00.760]   Cameras, what do you do?
[01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:01.840]   I'm a photographer.
[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:03.960]   (laughing)
[01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:05.320]   You had a weapon in your front seat?
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:09.160]   It's plastic bone arrow, it's pink, it belongs to my daughter.
[01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:10.120]   Where are you coming from?
[01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:10.960]   Where are you going?
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:12.320]   And people say dumps, I'm like, oh, just be rude.
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:13.520]   I was like, what am I gonna say?
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:15.400]   Oh, I'm leaving from a drug deal.
[01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:16.800]   - Oh, my words, you know the bad deal.
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:18.800]   - Yeah, don't say that.
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:20.440]   - You know, so it's really funny.
[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:23.320]   - Is it possible you're just a bad driver, Owen?
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:24.200]   - I'm an excellent driver
[01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:25.280]   because if I was a bad driver,
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:26.880]   I'd be getting tickets every time.
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:28.920]   So if I'm getting warnings,
[01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:30.160]   then they're not even giving me written warnings.
[01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:31.000]   - What is the warning?
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:31.840]   - I mean, one cop gave me,
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:33.640]   - Stop driving while African American?
[01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:34.800]   Is that the warning?
[01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:36.240]   - Okay, so one cop pulled me over,
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:38.520]   and this is actually one cop I'd tell you is a cool cop.
[01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:41.480]   He pulled me over and I was like, oh, what are you saying?
[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:42.880]   I pulled you over for 10.
[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:44.320]   I just bought my new iPhone.
[01:15:44.320 --> 01:15:45.440]   He's like, oh, is that from my phone?
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:46.640]   I'm like, yeah, he's like, oh, what am I gonna do?
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:47.480]   What do you think about?
[01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:49.200]   We talked about my iPhone for five minutes.
[01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:50.720]   He walked back, ran my stuff,
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:52.120]   and he came back with a written warning,
[01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:53.680]   and he said, warning for 10,
[01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:55.280]   get your tent taken off the window.
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:57.200]   Now, all these other cops to pull me over,
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:59.120]   the one cop said, oh, I pulled you over for 10.
[01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:00.120]   I pulled you over for 10.
[01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:00.960]   - 10 is the class.
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:01.800]   - I didn't have 10.
[01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:03.880]   - In fact, our director of engineering
[01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:05.320]   who's been driving around with 10 of the windows
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:08.160]   for several years got pulled over
[01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:09.840]   and had to fix it, got to fix it,
[01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:11.320]   big old fix it ticket.
[01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:12.360]   - So I'm just saying sure,
[01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:13.480]   so I'm not talking about cops all the time,
[01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:15.640]   but the last time I pulled over,
[01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:16.400]   the cop pulled me over,
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:18.520]   I've been watching it follow me for three miles.
[01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:20.320]   He pulled me over and he says,
[01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:21.200]   do you know why I pulled you over?
[01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:22.480]   I never answered that question.
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:23.840]   I said, no, sir, please tell me.
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:25.080]   Oh, well, you didn't use your blinker.
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:26.240]   I'm like, you've been following me
[01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:27.800]   for the last three and a half miles.
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:29.800]   I saw you, I definitely use my blinker.
[01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:31.760]   He looks at me, he's like, oh, your blinker must be out.
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:33.520]   I was like, sir, if you give me a ticket
[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:34.440]   for this blinker being out,
[01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:36.440]   I'm getting out, I'm videotaping that my blinker's work
[01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:38.760]   and my 2015 vehicle, and I'm taping you,
[01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:40.160]   and I'm not paying this ticket.
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:42.600]   Give me information, goes back, comes back and is like,
[01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:44.480]   I'm giving you a warning, not a written warning,
[01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:46.200]   just a verbal warning, and says,
[01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:47.760]   but sure, get that blinker fixed.
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:49.800]   And I'm like, really dude?
[01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:50.880]   Like really?
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:53.600]   I just got by luck or something, I don't know what it is.
[01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:54.440]   - Yeah.
[01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:57.000]   - And the blinker was working and it still was working?
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.840]   - Yes, we're in a car, it works.
[01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:00.040]   - No, they just suspect you,
[01:17:00.040 --> 01:17:02.840]   and they're trying to, they have to have some rationale
[01:17:02.840 --> 01:17:04.120]   for pulling you over, and they're hoping
[01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:07.040]   if they run you in your plates that they'll find you.
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:08.880]   - That's something I'm like, I have a worn out or a hot hole.
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:12.080]   - Is it beat up, is it look like a cheesy Hyundai?
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:14.040]   - It's a brand new Hyundai.
[01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:16.680]   It's a 2015, my Hyundai is sexy.
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:18.360]   My role is in this race. - Oh, that's the problem.
[01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:19.280]   - It is a problem, it's too sexy.
[01:17:19.280 --> 01:17:20.120]   - It's too sexy.
[01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:21.480]   - It's too sexy. - I got money.
[01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:22.480]   - Yeah.
[01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:25.640]   - So anyway, NSA can't find me.
[01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:28.320]   I'm off the ground. - Hey, where do we stand now
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:30.920]   on the net neutrality rules?
[01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:33.120]   Have they even happened?
[01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:35.960]   What is the latest on that?
[01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:40.760]   FCC has told ISPs, I think this is good,
[01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:43.720]   that if they have any doubts about how they should protect
[01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:47.520]   broadband consumer privacy under the new net neutrality
[01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:51.080]   regulations, you might wanna ask us the FCC.
[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:56.120]   They said they would be looking for good faith efforts
[01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:58.400]   to comply with privacy protections.
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:18:00.000]   - Thank you.
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:02.940]   - But if you ask our input, that would show good faith.
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:08.760]   The Title II Common Carrier Law or Regulations
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:12.880]   take effect June 12th, unless there's a court stay.
[01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:15.840]   And we have it, it's been so quiet.
[01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:18.880]   I don't know if there is, if there's anything going on.
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:20.840]   So June 12th, for all the people who think like
[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:23.120]   John C. de Vorac, that at that point,
[01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:25.160]   the whole thing is gonna go to hell in a hand basket
[01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:28.040]   and we're gonna have to get a license to podcast.
[01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:28.880]   We'll see.
[01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:30.120]   June 12th, it should happen.
[01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:34.200]   But so far, I like hearing the FCC saying,
[01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:37.120]   "Hey ISPs, you might wanna think about protecting
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:38.480]   your users privacy."
[01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:42.440]   Because nobody had asked them that before.
[01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:46.960]   Let's see.
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:49.480]   I'm rapidly running out of things.
[01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:50.560]   Let me do another commercial.
[01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:53.400]   If you guys see anything, look down the list of things.
[01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:56.280]   Did you see that we are now on Spotify?
[01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:57.440]   That's a good thing.
[01:18:57.440 --> 01:18:59.320]   - Yeah, you kinda pre-announced that on Macbreak weekly
[01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:00.160]   this week.
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:01.000]   - I did?
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:01.840]   - A little bit.
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:03.960]   - I was under NDA, what did I say?
[01:19:03.960 --> 01:19:05.520]   You said, "Can I talk about it?
[01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:06.360]   Can I talk about it?"
[01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:09.840]   Well, anyway, we're on Spotify and Deezer.
[01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:12.440]   - Oh, okay.
[01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:13.280]   - Nobody noticed it.
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:14.800]   And then I saw the Spotify announcement and I said,
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:15.640]   "Leo!"
[01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:19.920]   - Oh, when was that, geez, I must have, whoops.
[01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:23.440]   Anyway, this is a very good new Spotify.
[01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:25.240]   As it released a new iOS version,
[01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:28.560]   it'll soon be on Android that allows video clips,
[01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:30.880]   podcasts, they have a lot of nice new features.
[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:33.440]   Like if you're a runner, which I'm not obviously,
[01:19:33.440 --> 01:19:37.320]   it'll find music that matches your cadence, your pace.
[01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:38.640]   But the video, it's kind of interesting
[01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:39.480]   that they're gonna do video.
[01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:41.440]   It's always been, I've always thought of it
[01:19:41.440 --> 01:19:44.160]   as a music service, but they're gonna go well beyond that
[01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:46.240]   and they have a number of podcasts, including our own,
[01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:49.040]   all of our shows are on there, audio and video.
[01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:50.960]   So you can watch on Spotify.
[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:53.520]   - Here's the footsteps of Apple coming, you know.
[01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:55.640]   - Yeah, well they wanna get this out before Beats.
[01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:58.440]   I have to say at this point, I gotta think,
[01:19:58.440 --> 01:20:02.000]   and I'm sure Apple announced this next month at WWDC.
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:06.720]   Beats is just a, it has no shot.
[01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:09.360]   Look at title, which it launched with Jay-Z
[01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:13.480]   and every major modern star in attendance.
[01:20:13.480 --> 01:20:17.280]   - See, no, don't say that, just cut that though.
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:20.480]   See, we were on Title One, it was aesthetically pleasing.
[01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:23.600]   It didn't feel good, it didn't look good.
[01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:25.880]   Apple doesn't have that issue and/or problem
[01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:27.000]   with anything they do.
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:28.000]   Everything is always sleeping.
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:28.840]   - You think they have a shot.
[01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:29.680]   - Sweet and sexy.
[01:20:29.680 --> 01:20:30.520]   - You think they have a shot.
[01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:32.280]   - They think that it's all about a user base
[01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:34.040]   and they've got a nice catalog,
[01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:36.000]   if they wanna send out an email blast
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.680]   and get some people to look at their product.
[01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:39.480]   I'm just saying, a lot of people are giving a shot.
[01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:41.240]   - Don't you think most people have chosen to?
[01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:44.720]   - Like, I mean, I chose, I mean, actually I was on Spotify,
[01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:46.720]   I moved to Google, all access, but I'm going back
[01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:47.840]   to Spotify now.
[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:49.680]   Don't you think everybody--
[01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:50.520]   - Do you think everybody's--
[01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:51.360]   - If this is on a platform, if this is on a platform.
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:52.200]   - What do you listen to?
[01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:53.480]   Are you Beats, do you listen to Beats music?
[01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:55.640]   - I do when I have a Samsung phone, not anymore.
[01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:57.480]   - Now what do you listen to?
[01:20:57.480 --> 01:20:59.560]   - I download all my music 'cause I have time for--
[01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:00.560]   - You're not a streaming guy.
[01:21:00.560 --> 01:21:02.440]   How about you Jason?
[01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:04.760]   - I've got, I'm an old man, so I've got a lot of things
[01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:06.920]   that I own, but I also have Beats, yeah.
[01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:07.760]   - Beats.
[01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:09.680]   - Beats has some interesting stuff,
[01:21:09.680 --> 01:21:10.520]   I'm not saying Beats is bad,
[01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:12.760]   but it did not get much traction.
[01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:15.080]   - Because it was Beats and Beats,
[01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:17.600]   Beats was a headphone company trying to do something different.
[01:21:17.600 --> 01:21:19.440]   They were also stepping into a new market.
[01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:22.320]   Apple has a music and a selling point market,
[01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:23.280]   it's different.
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:24.880]   When they push it out to people,
[01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:27.440]   people are at least gonna give it a chance and try it.
[01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:28.280]   - Well, I'll try it.
[01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:30.800]   - I'll try it, they'll have a 30-day free trial, right?
[01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:33.960]   - Yeah, so, but I have all, it was funny
[01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:36.760]   when I went back to Spotify, all my playlists were still there.
[01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:39.680]   I forgot, I had a bunch of great playlists on there and stuff,
[01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:40.520]   and I was really pleased,
[01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:42.800]   and that stuff you cannot move over.
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:43.640]   - No.
[01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:45.640]   - I think most people see the libraries
[01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:48.600]   that commoditized, everybody has roughly the same music, right?
[01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:51.840]   There's some exclusives title has, of course.
[01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:53.880]   - Not if you wanna listen to Tila Swift's.
[01:21:53.880 --> 01:21:56.680]   - You're right.
[01:21:56.680 --> 01:21:58.680]   - I'm just saying, there might be more moves like that
[01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:00.840]   towards the future, which people feel more comfortable
[01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:02.400]   about selling their product through Apple
[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:04.920]   'cause they're used to that than they are these other companies.
[01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:06.680]   So, we'll see what happens.
[01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:09.600]   I'm just saying, don't discount Apple doing anything,
[01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:12.600]   'cause if Apple's shown us anything, they can sell,
[01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:13.760]   or anything they put their mind to.
[01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:14.680]   - But think about that watch,
[01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:16.240]   has that watch been a success?
[01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:19.880]   - At the party I was at today,
[01:22:19.880 --> 01:22:21.960]   I saw regular people that aren't tech people
[01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:23.440]   who support people at the watch.
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:24.280]   - Yeah.
[01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:25.120]   - I was shot, I was shot,
[01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:25.960]   I was like, I'm not gonna be expensive,
[01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:27.320]   I'm like, what are you doing?
[01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:29.320]   And you know what the reason for people buying
[01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:31.800]   the 600 off version versus the sport?
[01:22:31.800 --> 01:22:33.440]   The glass is more dense.
[01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:35.360]   - Yeah, Sapphire, we want Sapphire, yeah.
[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:36.840]   - So that was everybody's reasoning.
[01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:38.600]   I'm like, that's why you bought, yeah.
[01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:39.680]   'Cause I'm gonna be able to watch,
[01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:41.560]   we have pretty good studio audience here.
[01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:42.440]   - Do you have any Apple watches?
[01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:44.800]   - Google's developers, let's see, that's a great.
[01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:47.400]   - All right, all right, I guess that was a fair.
[01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:48.400]   You're wearing an Apple watch,
[01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:49.840]   I always wearing an Apple watch.
[01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:53.160]   Jason, you're wearing an Apple watch, all right.
[01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:54.760]   - Again, I follow Jason.
[01:22:54.760 --> 01:22:56.080]   - It's too fisted, there we go.
[01:22:56.080 --> 01:22:57.480]   - He's got both, he's doing a Leo.
[01:22:57.480 --> 01:22:58.920]   - He's doing a Leo.
[01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:00.440]   - He's doing a Leo.
[01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:02.240]   Don't go out of your house like that, Jason.
[01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:03.080]   - Oh, no, X.
[01:23:03.080 --> 01:23:04.200]   I go out of my house all the time,
[01:23:04.200 --> 01:23:06.000]   like I look like a freaking dork
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:09.400]   because I'm doing content for people,
[01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:11.160]   but I know that our audiences,
[01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:13.520]   you know, they want us to actually talk about this stuff
[01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:15.120]   without talking out our tale.
[01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:16.760]   And so, so you have to know about it.
[01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:17.600]   That's why I use Apple.
[01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:18.840]   - Just the Apple watch has been released,
[01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:22.080]   I've been wearing both the Moto X and the Apple watch.
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:23.720]   So if I saw you on the street,
[01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:25.160]   I'd be trying to take your lunch money.
[01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:27.000]   If I saw you outside a house like that,
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:28.120]   just so you know.
[01:23:28.120 --> 01:23:28.960]   - You'd be fully just--
[01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:31.240]   - I'm taking your lunch money, taking your lunch money.
[01:23:31.240 --> 01:23:34.240]   - I would be disappointed if someone hasn't.
[01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:37.120]   - So there's a company called Slice.
[01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:38.960]   I use a Slice app, the Slice app is great.
[01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:40.240]   It goes through your email.
[01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:43.160]   It lets you know when your orders are coming
[01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:44.800]   and stuff like that, notifies you.
[01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:47.680]   They also, apparently, are get cleaning information,
[01:23:47.680 --> 01:23:51.000]   which they then to tracking US consumer spending.
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.240]   And of course, Apple sends you an email.
[01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:55.440]   So if you're a Slice user, as I am,
[01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:57.320]   you'll get a Slice notification saying
[01:23:57.320 --> 01:23:59.440]   your watch is on its way or whatever.
[01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:03.280]   They say that according to the data they have,
[01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:04.760]   this is the graph.
[01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:07.920]   The Apple watch sales, huge day one,
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:10.720]   the initial inventory sell-off
[01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:12.200]   and the orders immediately fell
[01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:14.440]   and have been flat ever since.
[01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:16.600]   That is exactly the curve of your company.
[01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:18.560]   You do not want to see.
[01:24:18.560 --> 01:24:21.040]   - I think that's exactly what was expected.
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:22.320]   There was huge pen up demand.
[01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:25.040]   And then there was an available sale on day one
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:25.880]   that was pretty good.
[01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:27.720]   And now, and then the big problem is
[01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:30.760]   those day two sales every day since then
[01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:32.400]   has been something that you're placing an order
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:34.760]   for a product that you're not gonna get for six to eight.
[01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:36.280]   - So that kills sales.
[01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:37.600]   'Cause nobody wants to ask them to knock people around.
[01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:39.920]   - And also, if you get rid of that first graph,
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:42.480]   which is so massive, so huge, right?
[01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:44.880]   The rest of that graph probably looks pretty normal
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:46.920]   and is probably outselling every other smartwatch.
[01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:50.080]   - They're saying 30,000 watches a day in the US.
[01:24:50.080 --> 01:24:50.920]   That's actually pretty good.
[01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:53.080]   I guess I'd be happy with it. - That's pretty good.
[01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:55.680]   I mean, I've been a critic of the Apple Watch
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:56.960]   and what the sales are gonna be
[01:24:56.960 --> 01:24:58.840]   every time I've been on the show.
[01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:01.680]   But that said, I've actually seen,
[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:04.280]   I've been seeing real people wearing these,
[01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:05.640]   in Louisville, Kentucky.
[01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:09.280]   I saw the check out, the cashier check out last night,
[01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:12.800]   she was wearing one, asked her what she liked it, loved it.
[01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:15.560]   I saw two people the week after it came out.
[01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:19.120]   I saw two people at a gardener's fair here
[01:25:19.120 --> 01:25:20.920]   in Louisville wearing it, asked both of them.
[01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:24.240]   The first one said, absolutely, it was a college kid.
[01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:27.000]   He's a senior in college, absolutely loved it.
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.840]   And he also had the iPhone 6 Plus.
[01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:36.400]   And so he said, between the two of them,
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:39.640]   he does so much of his computing that way now.
[01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:41.600]   - He needs a computer. - And another guy.
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:45.200]   - Yeah, and another guy who said that he loved it,
[01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:47.160]   but it just needs more apps.
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:52.160]   And like I said, in my office, six people now,
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:54.280]   we're up to six people that have,
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:56.800]   I'm amazed at how many people they're buying it.
[01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:58.720]   - I'm just wondering how many real people
[01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:01.440]   watch smart watches of any kind.
[01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:02.640]   - That's what I was gonna say.
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:05.120]   If you think about the way that a first hockey puck looks,
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:06.720]   you also have to think about the fact that
[01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:09.160]   Apple again has a way of selling things.
[01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:10.520]   - No matter how that turns into you.
[01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:12.600]   - A reverse hockey puck looks exactly the same.
[01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:14.360]   It's a hockey stick, you meant, right?
[01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:15.200]   - Stick. - Okay.
[01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:16.040]   - I'm drinking, I'm talking.
[01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:17.560]   - Just listen to the player. - You know what I'm saying?
[01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:19.920]   Don't clarify me, just know what I'm telling you.
[01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:22.640]   The bottom line is that Apple sells things,
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:24.400]   and even though that chart looks the way it looks,
[01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:26.160]   reverse or forward or backwards,
[01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:28.680]   they still sold more watches from Apple
[01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:30.360]   than other smart watches have sold
[01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:32.560]   in like a year, six month period, whatever.
[01:26:32.560 --> 01:26:34.040]   You see more people wearing Apple watches
[01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:36.760]   than you saw Gear One, Gear Two, whatever.
[01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:38.600]   So in that essence, it's a success
[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:40.800]   because regular people are buying it just to try it
[01:26:40.800 --> 01:26:42.000]   because Apple said so.
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.480]   - It took Apple two years to sell two million iPods.
[01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:47.360]   You're selling almost a million watches a month in the US.
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:52.160]   - That 30,000 a day is like 10 and a half million a year.
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:53.240]   - Yeah, that ain't bad.
[01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:54.080]   - That's crazy.
[01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:56.880]   - In fact, it's selling faster than the first iPhone.
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:58.320]   It's selling faster than the first iPods.
[01:26:58.320 --> 01:27:02.080]   So I guess it's not selling as fast as the first day,
[01:27:02.080 --> 01:27:03.560]   but what could?
[01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:04.400]   - Think about that.
[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:05.840]   How many Apple wives have you seen out in the wild
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:07.640]   versus how many years watches have you seen?
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:09.240]   - Well, not many of either, really.
[01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:10.080]   - Let's see what you--
[01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:11.880]   - You don't go outside, you live at that town.
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:14.200]   You have a town made of robot people.
[01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:15.920]   - Most people don't want to watch us.
[01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:18.320]   Most people don't like 42 lillows,
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:19.560]   and that's it out in Petaloo.
[01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:23.480]   You gotta get outside that town and meet some people.
[01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:24.320]   You'll see it right now.
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:26.480]   - I'll ride my segue to the city limits,
[01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:28.120]   but I won't go beyond.
[01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:30.920]   - That's pretty much how you limit it.
[01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:31.760]   - Hey, let's check it.
[01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:32.760]   - You know what, if we had a great week,
[01:27:32.760 --> 01:27:34.240]   let me go get back to this topic.
[01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:35.080]   I don't want to show you.
[01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:37.040]   If you watched any of the shows this week,
[01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:38.400]   you saw a lot of good stuff.
[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:41.400]   We got a little, just a Letterman style kind of cut down.
[01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:42.240]   - Nice.
[01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:43.720]   - Of all the stuff that happened this week.
[01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:44.720]   - - - On Twit.
[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:45.720]   - On Twit.
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:46.720]   - Oh.
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:47.720]   - Can't find.
[01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:48.720]   - iOS today.
[01:27:48.720 --> 01:27:49.720]   - This is our new set.
[01:27:49.720 --> 01:27:50.720]   It's beautiful.
[01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:51.720]   My brain is connected to your brain.
[01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:52.720]   - Yeah.
[01:27:52.720 --> 01:27:53.720]   - This is the show all about iOS, Apple Watch, iPhones, iPad.
[01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:54.720]   - I did.
[01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:55.720]   Apple TV.
[01:27:55.720 --> 01:28:03.720]   - The new screen savers.
[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:06.720]   - Sometimes you want to make devices that save mankind.
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:10.200]   And sometimes you just want to make a big, stabbing robot.
[01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:12.720]   I, for one, welcome our robot overlords.
[01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:14.720]   - Security now.
[01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:19.600]   - They are known as passive, keyless entry and start.
[01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:21.960]   - I have keyless entry on my car.
[01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:25.360]   All I have to do is just touch the handle and it goes click and opens.
[01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:26.360]   - Yes.
[01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:29.320]   Anyone who wants to can take your car and drive away with it.
[01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:30.320]   - No.
[01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:31.320]   - I'll explain how.
[01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:32.320]   - Twit.
[01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:33.320]   - No.
[01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:34.320]   Where do I put my keys?
[01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:35.320]   - How about my segues?
[01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:36.320]   They can't drive away with those, can they?
[01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:38.320]   - That, you'll be able to chase them.
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:40.520]   - I'm like, I'm like, what miles an hour?
[01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:43.200]   - I mean, like that low speed chase on that sign, fella.
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:45.440]   Got a big week coming up.
[01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:47.880]   Mr. Mike Elgin has details.
[01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:51.840]   - Coming up this week, Recodes Code Conference begins Tuesday in Southern California.
[01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:56.440]   Pebble's new Pebble Time Smartwatch ships Wednesday and Google's annual Google I/O
[01:28:56.440 --> 01:28:59.400]   Developers Conference starts Thursday in San Francisco.
[01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:04.800]   We'll cover the keynote live at live.twit.tv starting just before 9.30am and of course,
[01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:09.920]   Leo will host tech news today at 8.30am on Thursday.
[01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:10.920]   - How many?
[01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:11.920]   - I'll talk to you Leo.
[01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:12.920]   - What?
[01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:13.920]   8.30 in the morning?
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:14.920]   - Oh dear.
[01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:22.800]   Our show today brought to you by a fresh book, the super simple cloud of cleaning solution
[01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:26.400]   that makes it easier for you if you own a small business or you're a freelancer to get
[01:29:26.400 --> 01:29:28.680]   paid fast.
[01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:31.800]   If you charge for your time and hours, you're going to love it.
[01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:35.880]   You can actually use their iPhone or Android app to keep track of time and hours.
[01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:41.640]   It makes it so easy to invoice and very importantly, makes it so easy for your clients to pay
[01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:42.640]   you.
[01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:47.760]   In fact, on average, fresh books users get paid five days faster.
[01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:52.440]   If you're using Word or Excel to make your invoices, as I was when I first discovered
[01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:55.400]   fresh books, you've got to try it.
[01:29:55.400 --> 01:29:58.720]   Professional looking invoices with a pay me button right on there.
[01:29:58.720 --> 01:30:04.040]   It also makes it easy if they don't pay you because automatic reminders are sent out.
[01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:09.920]   Fresh books users save about 16 hours a month on those administrative tasks like making invoices.
[01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:10.920]   Wouldn't that be awesome?
[01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:13.800]   That's like two whole extra days a month.
[01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:16.640]   On average, they double their revenue too in the first two years.
[01:30:16.640 --> 01:30:21.640]   If you ever need help, the fresh books supports rock stars are there ready to amaze you with
[01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:22.800]   their helpfulness.
[01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:23.960]   I think you'll like it.
[01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:27.920]   I used it for years and it really, really was a great solution.
[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:29.000]   Good for receipts too.
[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:33.400]   I had to bill for meals and travel and hotels.
[01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:36.800]   All of that, you take a picture with your smartphone and the receipt right into the invoice
[01:30:36.800 --> 01:30:38.600]   couldn't be easier.
[01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:40.760]   Come tax time, you will be very happy.
[01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:43.640]   Don't make it easy this year for taxes.
[01:30:43.640 --> 01:30:47.080]   Fresh books started right now for 30 days free with no obligation.
[01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:49.680]   Freshbooks.com/twit.
[01:30:49.680 --> 01:30:51.560]   And don't forget when they ask you, "How did you hear about us?"
[01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:53.080]   Make sure you mention Twit.
[01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:56.080]   Freshbooks.com/twit.
[01:30:56.080 --> 01:30:57.640]   30 days free right now.
[01:30:57.640 --> 01:31:04.680]   Thank you so much for their support of this week in tech.
[01:31:04.680 --> 01:31:06.240]   Barack Obama is on Twitter.
[01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:09.560]   POTUS at POTUS.
[01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:11.880]   I always thought he was because there's an @BarackObama.
[01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:16.840]   Apparently he didn't, that wasn't his thing.
[01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:17.840]   What's the deal there?
[01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:18.840]   The tweet was funny.
[01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:21.480]   It was like they finally let me have an account.
[01:31:21.480 --> 01:31:24.920]   After eight years or whatever.
[01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:26.720]   And now he's fairly active on this.
[01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:32.000]   He did, I think he would tweet on the White House account with DashBO, his initials.
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.000]   Then you would know he did it.
[01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:34.920]   But look at all of this.
[01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:39.440]   The funniest thing is Bill Clinton, when he sees the POTUS account, says, "Welcome to
[01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:41.040]   Twitter, POTUS.
[01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:44.080]   One question, does that username stay with the office?
[01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:46.120]   #AskingForAFriend."
[01:31:46.120 --> 01:31:49.840]   These guys have mastered social media, I gotta say.
[01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:52.960]   And then the president responds, "Good question Bill Clinton.
[01:31:52.960 --> 01:31:55.840]   The handle comes with the house.
[01:31:55.840 --> 01:32:02.120]   So anybody interested in Flotis, which would be the first lady's account, or as Clinton
[01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:07.240]   would be, if Hillary Clinton gets elected president, I've heard she's running, if you
[01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:09.200]   use Twitter you can't help but see she's running it.
[01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:12.880]   She's apparently bought every Twitter ad forever.
[01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:16.200]   Is that just me or do you see that whenever you go to Twitter?
[01:32:16.200 --> 01:32:17.760]   The second most.
[01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:22.200]   It's always, well now it's T-Mobile and Taylor Swift.
[01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:26.080]   She must be in your demo group.
[01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:27.080]   You don't see that?
[01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:31.080]   I got brilliant 20 year old interns running this money account.
[01:32:31.080 --> 01:32:34.040]   Yeah, they know because #AskingForAFriend.
[01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:37.160]   That's pretty, that's like you know what you're doing on the Twitter.
[01:32:37.160 --> 01:32:38.160]   Yeah.
[01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:41.760]   Unficed sad to say, of course, immediately he goes on Twitter.
[01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:45.680]   Terrible, horrible racist crap tweeted at his account.
[01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:50.360]   You know what, the thing, the racist stuff, whatever, people are going to do it, I almost
[01:32:50.360 --> 01:32:51.360]   get it.
[01:32:51.360 --> 01:32:56.240]   Again, I'd rather you be in the streets preaching at your races than in a we, he's hiding.
[01:32:56.240 --> 01:32:58.080]   I'd rather know where they're coming from.
[01:32:58.080 --> 01:33:03.360]   But the thing that was crazy is people that just automatically sent this man death threats.
[01:33:03.360 --> 01:33:06.360]   And do you not know that the secret service that they're coming out?
[01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:09.320]   There's one guy, there's one guy who called the news and was reporting to people they
[01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:10.320]   showed up at his house.
[01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:13.360]   And of course he threatened, says something about a kind of president and he's a gun owner
[01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:14.360]   and all this kind of stuff.
[01:33:14.360 --> 01:33:17.480]   But I'm like dummy, just because you make a fake, they're going to find you.
[01:33:17.480 --> 01:33:19.240]   I talk about that and I say, I guess they would find me.
[01:33:19.240 --> 01:33:23.440]   And they found some of these guys with fake names and dummy emails and stuff and they
[01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:24.520]   showed up at everybody's door.
[01:33:24.520 --> 01:33:25.920]   Of course they found them.
[01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:27.520]   So and they found them quick.
[01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:29.440]   So how stupid are you?
[01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:32.640]   Yeah, it's pretty stupid.
[01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:35.560]   The presidents people said, look, we knew that would happen.
[01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:36.800]   Of course it would.
[01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:40.800]   But we think the opportunity to interact directly with voters is so valuable.
[01:33:40.800 --> 01:33:43.040]   We're willing to put up with a little bit of trolling.
[01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:44.640]   Everybody gets a troll on Twitter.
[01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:46.160]   I don't know his values for him anymore.
[01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:47.160]   He's done.
[01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:49.320]   All right, that's a good point.
[01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:53.400]   But as he said, this is just the president's account, whoever the president is.
[01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:54.400]   Yeah.
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:33:55.400]   Yeah.
[01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:59.360]   I'm just saying, if I was him, I wouldn't be building up with all my awesome tweets.
[01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:03.520]   The street credit experts are going to come in for free and earn my 4.4 million followers.
[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:05.640]   But he's got 2.38 right now.
[01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:08.120]   He's got fewer than Taylor Swift by a landslide.
[01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:11.760]   But but he's got to figure out what he's going to do after he gets out.
[01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:13.320]   All he needs a job and stuff, right?
[01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:15.040]   So this is why he has his own name.
[01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:16.680]   You don't go pimp yourself on post.
[01:34:16.680 --> 01:34:17.680]   Good point.
[01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:18.680]   That's not Brandon.
[01:34:18.680 --> 01:34:19.680]   That's not marketing.
[01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:21.440]   And somebody should have told Barack that.
[01:34:21.440 --> 01:34:23.640]   But apparently he didn't call me like he should have.
[01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:24.640]   So he's making mistakes.
[01:34:24.640 --> 01:34:27.440]   You don't waste them golden tweets on potus.
[01:34:27.440 --> 01:34:30.760]   And then somebody else gets to come in there and take it from a very good point.
[01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:31.760]   That's a very good point.
[01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:32.760]   No way.
[01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:33.760]   Jose, not happening.
[01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:35.800]   That's a very good point.
[01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:38.960]   Remember for a while, Twitter said that Justin Bieber had his own server.
[01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:44.080]   Do you think the president has his own server like the the potus server?
[01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:48.640]   It seems a little weird to me that Twitter, I mean, it's a generic like White House,
[01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:50.120]   potus being totally generic.
[01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:52.120]   There's an actual, if you're a Barack Obama.
[01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:53.120]   Yeah.
[01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:54.680]   And if you were a successful presidential candidate, right?
[01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:59.320]   Presumably you've got your own successful presidential Twitter account.
[01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:03.200]   Maybe the one thing that I can figure is that there are some rules about what the campaign
[01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:06.160]   can do versus what you can do when you're in office.
[01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:11.840]   And so the idea is maybe, maybe Barack Obama, you know, at Barack Obama is the is he front
[01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:13.360]   comes from his campaign.
[01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:16.760]   And the next president would similarly have to keep them separate.
[01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:19.400]   But you know, now you've got White House and you're going to have potus plus you've got
[01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:23.320]   whatever they're there, whoever the next president is their personal address.
[01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:25.480]   Well, Hillary's got one who ever it is.
[01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:26.480]   It's confusing.
[01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:27.480]   Yeah.
[01:35:27.480 --> 01:35:28.480]   And the next person steps in.
[01:35:28.480 --> 01:35:29.480]   Go ahead, Owen.
[01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:30.480]   Sorry.
[01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:32.800]   I said, and the next person steps in to be president.
[01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:36.520]   Honestly, they're not going to want to touch Twitter or any kind of social media because
[01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:39.440]   they're going to be busy and you make one full step and you're slim.
[01:35:39.440 --> 01:35:41.840]   But rock could come on there and shoot three is all day and miss.
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:42.840]   It doesn't matter.
[01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:43.840]   They want his way out.
[01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:47.840]   But a new person coming in is going to hop on potus and start making jabs and everybody
[01:35:47.840 --> 01:35:48.840]   and trying to be funny.
[01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:50.320]   Like, fool, you better run my country.
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:52.000]   You ain't got time to be tweeting.
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:54.600]   Anyway, that's kind of my feeling.
[01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:59.120]   And by the way, they show a picture of him using an iPhone, but he does not have an iPhone.
[01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:03.760]   So he obviously borrowed somebody's iPhone because he has to use a blackberry.
[01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:10.280]   I mean, who knows how much Barack, you know, was really involved with this launching.
[01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:13.640]   The only thing that I thought was sort of cool about it is sort of reminding me of, you
[01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:19.080]   know, that movie, the American president where Michael Douglas plays a president and
[01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:23.680]   he's getting, he's taking hits all day from this guy who's running against him, you know.
[01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:24.680]   Yeah.
[01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:26.000]   Aaron, Aaron, Aaron, Sorkin wrote the screenplay.
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:28.960]   So you know, they're going to slam Twitter or whatever.
[01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:29.960]   Yeah, what, what happens?
[01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:34.080]   Well, well, well, then he gets to his speech at the end, you know, and he sort of lays
[01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:38.480]   into this guy and sort of, you know, reads in the right act and it's all great.
[01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:43.480]   And the last line of it, because this guy, you know, in his campaign speech where he's
[01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:47.640]   dog in the president, keeps saying, you know, my name is, I can't remember what his name
[01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:50.400]   and I'm running for president.
[01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:54.920]   And, and finally, you know, in the speech where it's sort of, you know, unleashing all
[01:36:54.920 --> 01:37:00.200]   these zingers on this clown, he says, you know, my name's Andrew Shepard and I am the
[01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:01.680]   president, you know.
[01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:04.320]   And so that's kind of what POTUS reminds me of.
[01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:07.640]   It's like, you know, lots of people can tweet and lots of people are going to say stuff
[01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:11.640]   and politicians are going to say, you know, they say dumb stuff all the time on all kinds
[01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:13.920]   of, on their own accounts.
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:18.440]   And it's sort of reminding me like, here's the Twitter account from the president, you
[01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:19.440]   know, and.
[01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:23.080]   Oh, important is Twitter to presidential politics to elections.
[01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:26.080]   I mean, you know, you see, this has been going on for a while.
[01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:31.360]   Clinton appears on our senior hall playing the saxophone when he was running for president.
[01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:35.280]   You see, you see MTV presidential can't show up on MTV.
[01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:36.640]   It's part of wooing the electorate.
[01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:40.640]   It's Twitter, is it kind of the you've got to be there and you've got to be interacting
[01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:42.160]   with viewers or whatever.
[01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:43.160]   What do you call it?
[01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:44.640]   Tweet your followers.
[01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:49.280]   The media and people of our ilk would say, oh, why aren't you on Twitter?
[01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:50.360]   You should be on Twitter.
[01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:54.280]   But if you actually look at the way the country votes younger people, no matter how much MTV,
[01:37:54.280 --> 01:37:57.720]   no matter how much shucking and jab and you doing our studio hall, they do not come out
[01:37:57.720 --> 01:37:58.960]   to vote.
[01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:02.840]   Most of the people that vote in this country are over a certain age group and they're probably
[01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:04.480]   not really on Twitter.
[01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:09.040]   To my point, that's a number two point three million followers and a lot of those people
[01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:13.360]   probably what if a Republican gets in, is that number is going to drop off a cliff because
[01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:16.560]   people really don't care what you're saying unless they're supporting you.
[01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:21.800]   So, you know, one of the reasons are younger people right now where they're not coming
[01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:22.800]   out and droves to.
[01:38:22.800 --> 01:38:23.800]   Well, that's the point.
[01:38:23.800 --> 01:38:27.120]   One of the reasons that people go on MTV, candidates go on MTV is because they were hoping
[01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:28.200]   to bring out.
[01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:31.720]   There's voters that you're you're not capitalizing on because they don't vote.
[01:38:31.720 --> 01:38:37.040]   If you can get them to the polls and voting for you, that can make a big difference, right?
[01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:39.080]   But is Twitter where young people go?
[01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:41.000]   I don't think so.
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:42.000]   Who uses Twitter?
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:43.440]   Or so than Facebook.
[01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:47.760]   I mean, it is, you know, it has a younger demo than Facebook does.
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:52.800]   So, you know, I mean, I think, you know, I think I was right is it is a lot of young
[01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:53.800]   people.
[01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:57.520]   The only thing that I'd say to sort of keep in mind is, you know, that that group that
[01:38:57.520 --> 01:39:01.360]   is on Twitter is probably that one that that is swinging, right?
[01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:06.920]   That it's the people that are not necessarily entrenched in, you know, one side or the other.
[01:39:06.920 --> 01:39:12.120]   Although you see plenty of, you know, political gamesmanship on Twitter, but, you know, with
[01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:17.560]   that younger demographic, you know, people that are probably less solidified in their
[01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:18.760]   political beliefs.
[01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:20.680]   And so, you know, swing one way or another.
[01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:25.200]   So I think that's probably the biggest benefit to Twitter is your chance to, you know, to
[01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:32.000]   reach some of those swing voters who are, you know, who are there and who you in every
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:35.200]   election, you know, those are the people that you have to convince.
[01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:38.560]   You know, you have to, you know, rally your base and get them to show up.
[01:39:38.560 --> 01:39:43.080]   And then you have to get enough of that swing, those swing voters in the middle to come over
[01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:44.080]   to your side.
[01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:47.920]   Those are the two ways you win elections in presidential elections, you know, in the
[01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:48.920]   United States.
[01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:51.680]   And maybe you get 10% extra people from Twitter.
[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:55.320]   I mean, I know when Bill Clinton was on our studio hall, he stole my heart.
[01:39:55.320 --> 01:39:57.720]   And from then on, I love to do, he messed up a lot.
[01:39:57.720 --> 01:40:01.640]   But I just thought he was the coolest dude until Brock came through and I boraxed the
[01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:02.880]   coolest president we've had.
[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:05.680]   But I do know that television presence that Bill Clinton did.
[01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:10.680]   I was like, yo, this is a cool dude.
[01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:14.680]   So there are things where you can swing people in or inspire someone to vote if you do something
[01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:15.680]   the right way.
[01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:18.840]   So I'm just saying, you got to put your nets, not all your eggs in one basket per se.
[01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:21.960]   You got to put all spread the eggs out and try and get new people.
[01:40:21.960 --> 01:40:24.120]   But in general, yeah.
[01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:25.120]   All right.
[01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:30.680]   By the way, at Barack Obama is run by his 501c.
[01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:34.160]   Oh, and I think that's a follow on from it being run by the campaign.
[01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:39.560]   And I really do wonder, I really do wonder if the POTUS account is there because somebody,
[01:40:39.560 --> 01:40:43.720]   some lawyer said, you know, we should probably just have a, an office of the president Twitter
[01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:48.760]   account because we all, every president is going to have to keep it separate from there,
[01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:51.560]   campaign, and that's what this is about.
[01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:56.720]   And, but the real, the question I find interesting is that how, how does the president have to
[01:40:56.720 --> 01:40:57.960]   be on Twitter?
[01:40:57.960 --> 01:40:59.640]   I feel like the president should not be on Twitter.
[01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:03.160]   I feel like it's a communication mechanism of whether, I mean, is it the president, the
[01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:07.760]   president, it's like, when somebody sent his email that was the first president to send
[01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:11.720]   an email and they had to tell him, even Taylor Swift, I'm sure is not Taylor Swift.
[01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:12.720]   They have people.
[01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:14.280]   They got, they got people.
[01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:15.280]   They got people.
[01:41:15.280 --> 01:41:16.280]   Yeah.
[01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:17.280]   They have writers talented, clearly.
[01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:18.280]   Yeah.
[01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:20.240]   Taylor Swift pretty much runs around stuff.
[01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:21.240]   Don't use her as an example.
[01:41:21.240 --> 01:41:24.480]   Taylor Swift, she really, she really, check her Instagram, check her stuff.
[01:41:24.480 --> 01:41:27.520]   She'd be doing personal pictures and stuff for her own, like, somebody's taking those
[01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:28.520]   personal pictures.
[01:41:28.520 --> 01:41:30.080]   No, she's taking a lot.
[01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:31.560]   Anyway, just not Taylor Swift.
[01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:32.560]   You somebody else, Taylor.
[01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:33.560]   Taylor.
[01:41:33.560 --> 01:41:34.560]   No, I'm very impressed to me.
[01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:37.560]   She is using social media as well as anybody, right?
[01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:43.040]   You know, she gives gifts to her fans and, yeah, no, I know, I know that.
[01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:46.440]   Oh, Tade Diggs followed me from the last time I was on Twitch, shout out to Tade Diggs.
[01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:48.400]   I was like, oh, look at Tade Diggs.
[01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:49.400]   He's an actor.
[01:41:49.400 --> 01:41:50.400]   He's a cool guy.
[01:41:50.400 --> 01:41:51.400]   Now he's following me because I guess he watches your show.
[01:41:51.400 --> 01:41:54.200]   So I was like, why are you following me?
[01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:55.200]   That's awesome.
[01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:56.200]   Me too.
[01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:57.200]   He follows you too.
[01:41:57.200 --> 01:41:58.200]   He does.
[01:41:58.200 --> 01:41:59.200]   Yeah.
[01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:01.800]   See, you got, you got to reach Uncle Leo.
[01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:02.800]   You got reach.
[01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:04.400]   Does he want to be on the show?
[01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:05.840]   I'll ask him.
[01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:06.840]   Would you?
[01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:07.840]   Yeah.
[01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:08.840]   And daddy follows me.
[01:42:08.840 --> 01:42:09.840]   Doubt it.
[01:42:09.840 --> 01:42:16.200]   Apple's like, is it the real Tay Diggs or just Tay Diggs social media guru?
[01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:17.200]   It's his account.
[01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:18.200]   It's his verified account.
[01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:19.200]   It's his account.
[01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:20.200]   Certified?
[01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:21.200]   Yeah, because I don't, I'll be honest.
[01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:26.040]   I think if you're the president, you have other things to do than to the tweeting.
[01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:27.040]   That was my point earlier.
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:28.200]   I mean, like, I don't really care.
[01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:30.200]   Like you got stuff to do, dude.
[01:42:30.200 --> 01:42:31.200]   What you tweet out.
[01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:34.200]   And again, people aren't going to go and say, oh, are there aliens coming?
[01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:35.200]   Let me go check with the president.
[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:37.800]   Like they're going to go to whatever news outlet website.
[01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:43.000]   I mean, they'll follow somebody on Twitter and believe anything they say versus listen
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:44.000]   to the president.
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:45.640]   That's just how the world works anymore.
[01:42:45.640 --> 01:42:49.040]   So by the way, Tay is going to be Hedwig on Broadway.
[01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:50.600]   Tay, you're the right guy for that.
[01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:51.600]   That's going to be awesome.
[01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:53.600]   Great show.
[01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:57.120]   Apple wants local TV in its web TV service.
[01:42:57.120 --> 01:43:02.160]   That means don't expect web TV from Apple for some time.
[01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:08.000]   That is crazy talk, but if it didn't come from Peter Kafka on recode, I would not, I
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:09.000]   would not credit it.
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:14.120]   But boy, these guys, Peter and Don Chimelevsky, you definitely know what they're talking
[01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:16.440]   about.
[01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:20.200]   Industry executives familiar with Apple plan say that they're going to individual cities,
[01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:25.200]   the individual broadcasters, local broadcasters, and they want, if you have an Apple TV for
[01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:28.800]   you to be able to get your local station in your area.
[01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:33.560]   It's easier than it used to be because one, so many more of the affiliates are owned
[01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:39.160]   by the networks now that the regulations about how many stations a network can own have been
[01:43:39.160 --> 01:43:42.880]   watered down to the point where you can make a deal with ABC and pick up a huge number
[01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:43.880]   of ABC stations.
[01:43:43.880 --> 01:43:47.080]   And then two, there's some infrastructure that has happened in the last few years.
[01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:52.280]   Direct TV spent, I don't know, five or 10 years building out their local station broadcast
[01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:56.640]   where most, if not all, I don't know, most markets, if you get direct TV, you can get
[01:43:56.640 --> 01:44:00.600]   your local channels and that requires direct TV to make a deal and get a feed.
[01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:03.280]   Well, cable companies do it now and there's the must carry rules.
[01:44:03.280 --> 01:44:05.080]   Right, but the cable is local, right?
[01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:07.040]   This is, I mean, you're with Apple.
[01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:09.320]   They're trying to make it everywhere.
[01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:10.320]   It's an interesting idea.
[01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:14.360]   You know, if you want to be a cord cutter, but you still want to get TV service over
[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:19.960]   internet, you probably don't want to slam the door on your local CBS station or whatever.
[01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:24.480]   And this is exactly what keeps people from cord cutting is the access to the live locals,
[01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:27.120]   things like the Academy Awards and the Super Bowl are going to be on live locals.
[01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:30.520]   And not everybody can put up a little antenna because there are a lot of stuff here.
[01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:31.520]   We can't hear it.
[01:44:31.520 --> 01:44:34.080]   Yeah, I'm blocked by a mountain from Sutra Tower of San Francisco.
[01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:37.080]   I would love to get the San Francisco stations, but we can't get them.
[01:44:37.080 --> 01:44:38.080]   We got Roanert Park.
[01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:40.080]   Nice little station in Roanert Park.
[01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:41.080]   Channel 50.
[01:44:41.080 --> 01:44:42.080]   Yeah, that's it.
[01:44:42.080 --> 01:44:43.080]   KFTY.
[01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:47.520]   You know, you're in bad shape when you're reaching Channel 50 in Channel 77.
[01:44:47.520 --> 01:44:49.320]   That kind of thing.
[01:44:49.320 --> 01:44:50.320]   All right.
[01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:51.320]   Well, that's interesting.
[01:44:51.320 --> 01:44:54.800]   So maybe it won't be a delay because they can go to the ONO.
[01:44:54.800 --> 01:45:00.600]   And I feel like Apple has all the rumors of Apple TV coming out with a new version in
[01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:05.440]   June seems to me that Apple's finally just decided they're going to do this all in public.
[01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:07.320]   They're going to get the new hardware out there.
[01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:09.760]   They're going to negotiate when people know it.
[01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:14.160]   The element of surprise, chasing the element surprise I feel like has delayed their Apple
[01:45:14.160 --> 01:45:16.800]   TV release potentially by a couple of years.
[01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:17.800]   And I don't think they need to do it.
[01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:21.040]   This is also maybe a sign of Tim Cook's Apple being a little more open about this stuff
[01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:26.280]   and not feeling they need to drop this whole big mind-blowing thing all at once with everybody
[01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:27.280]   on board.
[01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:29.280]   But instead, you know, just go back and do it.
[01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:30.280]   Peace meal if they have to.
[01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:34.000]   It's just going to be something they'll talk about next month at the developer conference.
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:35.000]   I would assume so.
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:40.280]   They did not hold on to the announcement of their new iMacs, less expensive iMacs and
[01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:42.920]   new MacBook Pros with Force Touch.
[01:45:42.920 --> 01:45:46.240]   Just put out a press release this week and said, "Hey, we got new iMacs."
[01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:49.000]   The other speed bumps, so they tend to do that.
[01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:50.000]   Just put out a press release.
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.760]   Although, I got to say, I love that 5K retina iMac.
[01:45:52.760 --> 01:45:55.240]   And if you can get it for $19.99, that's good.
[01:45:55.240 --> 01:46:00.560]   Yeah, and they drop the, yeah, and I think they drop the higher end models price by $200
[01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:01.560]   or $300, too.
[01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:02.560]   Yeah.
[01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:03.560]   So it's a great, so I have one of those and it's great.
[01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:04.560]   It's gorgeous.
[01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:07.800]   I'm going to advocate the $19.99 model because it's a spinning hard drive.
[01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:10.600]   It doesn't even have the fusion drive with the SSD.
[01:46:10.600 --> 01:46:11.600]   So get the $2300.
[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:16.020]   I feel like if you have to pop a couple hundred dollars more to get some SSD in there just
[01:46:16.020 --> 01:46:17.600]   to make the storage faster, do it.
[01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:18.600]   Do it.
[01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:19.600]   That is such a great system.
[01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:23.440]   It is about as fast as the base model Mac Pro, I believe.
[01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:24.440]   Oh, I know.
[01:46:24.440 --> 01:46:27.120]   It makes me cry every day.
[01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:30.800]   It's the way to go and I'm sad about my Mac Pro.
[01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:35.040]   They also announced the Force Tuck trackpad will make its way to the 15 inch.
[01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:38.600]   It's been on the 13 inch Mac book pro since the same day as they introduced the Mac book,
[01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:39.600]   but now it's on the 15.
[01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:41.800]   Do you like, you know, you're using an 11.
[01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:44.720]   Yeah, we just got Lisa just got the new Mac book.
[01:46:44.720 --> 01:46:48.080]   She says she's taking a little time to get used to the new keyboard, which has very little
[01:46:48.080 --> 01:46:49.880]   travel, but it's it's thin.
[01:46:49.880 --> 01:46:50.880]   Yeah.
[01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:55.480]   I mean, a sir, a sir, seven, which also was very thin and very little key travel.
[01:46:55.480 --> 01:46:57.160]   That keyboard is amazing though.
[01:46:57.160 --> 01:46:58.160]   Do you like it?
[01:46:58.160 --> 01:47:02.760]   I've been I've been talking up Apple today, which is weird for this word.
[01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:09.400]   But yeah, Jason Snell knows, but I love the keyboard on that on that 12 inch.
[01:47:09.400 --> 01:47:10.400]   You're trying to.
[01:47:10.400 --> 01:47:11.400]   MacBook.
[01:47:11.400 --> 01:47:12.400]   Yeah, I just did my review.
[01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:16.680]   I released my review for, you know, with professionals in mind using this thing.
[01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:23.000]   And my review is basically that, you know, highly for highly mobile business travelers
[01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:24.640]   and for kind of web workers.
[01:47:24.640 --> 01:47:26.800]   This is just kind of the state of the art.
[01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:32.640]   And that keyboard, I literally am faster and more accurate on that keyboard.
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:36.960]   Just that time of travel with that, just a little bit less key travel, you know, every
[01:47:36.960 --> 01:47:38.160]   one counts.
[01:47:38.160 --> 01:47:43.040]   And I feel like I feel like I have measured it a little bit.
[01:47:43.040 --> 01:47:47.480]   And I, you know, I am faster and because the keys are wider and there's less space between
[01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:51.360]   keys, you know, I am a little more accurate on that keyboard.
[01:47:51.360 --> 01:47:52.640]   I don't like force touch.
[01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:56.040]   I deactivated it because is what annoyed the heck out of me.
[01:47:56.040 --> 01:47:59.920]   I kept, you know, use it without it because it doesn't have a click.
[01:47:59.920 --> 01:48:00.920]   You can't.
[01:48:00.920 --> 01:48:03.720]   So force touches is just that essentially like a long press, right?
[01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:04.720]   Oh, you told YC.
[01:48:04.720 --> 01:48:06.360]   So you still get the click.
[01:48:06.360 --> 01:48:08.000]   You just don't use the long press.
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:09.520]   I just don't use that long press thing.
[01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:11.720]   It kept it messed up, you know, when I was kind of.
[01:48:11.720 --> 01:48:12.720]   Yeah.
[01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:13.720]   Yeah.
[01:48:13.720 --> 01:48:16.560]   I tried to click and drag, you know, files into folders and the stupid force touch thing
[01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:17.560]   would come up.
[01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:18.560]   Right.
[01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:22.360]   So I hated that, but I love the keyboard as far as, you know, the ports thing is kind
[01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:27.800]   of weird too and only having one port and, but it does have great battery life.
[01:48:27.800 --> 01:48:32.680]   So you don't necessarily, it was sort of weird kind of unplugging your charger to, you
[01:48:32.680 --> 01:48:36.080]   know, to plug in something for USB, like to plug in a USB.
[01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:37.080]   Yeah.
[01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:39.720]   I bought the silly $79 dongle.
[01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:40.720]   Yeah, the dongle.
[01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:42.800]   That is a ridiculous price for that.
[01:48:42.800 --> 01:48:47.800]   But it gives you, it goes into this type C port and then gives you a regular USB port
[01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:55.040]   and a full size HDMI and another type C so you can charge or, or charge a phone.
[01:48:55.040 --> 01:48:57.400]   You can go, it goes in both directions, which is kind of interesting.
[01:48:57.400 --> 01:48:58.400]   Yeah.
[01:48:58.400 --> 01:49:01.120]   What I want, I mean, it's cool because you now you're going to be able to go and charge
[01:49:01.120 --> 01:49:03.920]   this off like one of the battery, seeing battery packs like you used to charge your
[01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:04.920]   phone.
[01:49:04.920 --> 01:49:05.920]   Right.
[01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:07.960]   I think that's one of the coolest things about it.
[01:49:07.960 --> 01:49:14.000]   But I also felt like this, this machine, I love 11 inch MacBook Air and so that's what
[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:15.400]   Jason's using right now.
[01:49:15.400 --> 01:49:16.400]   Yeah.
[01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:22.400]   So this thing was, I'm sort of the ideal candidate for this machine and it is impressive that
[01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:27.240]   they got the Retina display in there, you know, at 12 inches because it's basically
[01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:32.580]   the same size as the 11 inch, just a little bit wider and just a little bit more narrow
[01:49:32.580 --> 01:49:34.880]   and obviously thinner.
[01:49:34.880 --> 01:49:39.280]   But it's a very similar form factor and the fact that they got the Retina display in there
[01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:43.560]   and it doesn't hit battery life because I still get nine or 10 hours.
[01:49:43.560 --> 01:49:48.840]   I get to a coast of coast flight on that thing easily, you know, with, with no problem.
[01:49:48.840 --> 01:49:52.800]   You saw Marco Arment who just said, this is the worst thing ever.
[01:49:52.800 --> 01:49:54.440]   He called it mistake one.
[01:49:54.440 --> 01:49:55.440]   Was not for him.
[01:49:55.440 --> 01:49:56.440]   That was not.
[01:49:56.440 --> 01:49:57.440]   He is.
[01:49:57.440 --> 01:50:00.040]   Mark, we should explain is very well known in the Mac community.
[01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:05.360]   One of the premier Mac programmers, he was one of the first hires at Tumblr.
[01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:06.460]   He did Insta paper.
[01:50:06.460 --> 01:50:09.120]   He's now doing overcast a podcast client.
[01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:10.960]   He says he hates the keyboard.
[01:50:10.960 --> 01:50:11.960]   He hates the.
[01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:12.960]   He hates the.
[01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:17.920]   And he hates everything that the Retina display is fuzzy.
[01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:21.720]   I don't agree with him on any of those points, except I also don't like the keyboard.
[01:50:21.720 --> 01:50:23.320]   For me, it just doesn't, it doesn't work.
[01:50:23.320 --> 01:50:24.320]   I don't like the keys though.
[01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:26.320]   If you compare them to the 15 inch, they're bigger.
[01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:27.320]   The keycaps are bigger.
[01:50:27.320 --> 01:50:28.320]   The keycaps are bigger.
[01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:29.320]   Should be easier to.
[01:50:29.320 --> 01:50:30.320]   You're not a keyboard.
[01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:31.320]   They are easier to hit.
[01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:32.320]   They're more stable.
[01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:33.800]   They make a loud noise when you press them.
[01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:34.800]   They do.
[01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:35.800]   A lot of people are like, it's very loud.
[01:50:35.800 --> 01:50:38.040]   But there's also a lot less travel.
[01:50:38.040 --> 01:50:41.200]   And when I talked to Apple about this, when I was writing my review, they said, look, we
[01:50:41.200 --> 01:50:43.560]   know that the reduced travel is a compromise.
[01:50:43.560 --> 01:50:45.400]   They admitted it, which believes me.
[01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:46.400]   They don't.
[01:50:46.400 --> 01:50:48.880]   They don't usually do that when they don't usually admit compromise.
[01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:53.440]   But they said, in exchange for that, we tried to do a lot of other things like the new mechanism
[01:50:53.440 --> 01:50:56.720]   that we use and the bigger keycaps and all of these other things to try and offset the
[01:50:56.720 --> 01:50:57.720]   reduced travel.
[01:50:57.720 --> 01:50:59.800]   And it, you know, it does a little bit.
[01:50:59.800 --> 01:51:05.200]   But in the end for me, it's that losing that travel, it just, I don't like the feel of it.
[01:51:05.200 --> 01:51:06.720]   But that's a personal choice.
[01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:10.440]   Everybody who talks to me about getting one of these, I say, go to the Apple store and
[01:51:10.440 --> 01:51:14.240]   give it a try and see if you might like it or not.
[01:51:14.240 --> 01:51:16.000]   Because for some people, it's fine.
[01:51:16.000 --> 01:51:17.000]   And other people will hate it.
[01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:20.720]   I actually kicked in on this Kickstarter hub plus thing.
[01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:23.000]   I hope they got funded.
[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:24.000]   I'm hoping it.
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:27.680]   Now, see, this is what's interesting because Apple has, for the first time, in living memory
[01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:34.600]   chosen a standard, which is so that means you don't have to go somebody to get a mag
[01:51:34.600 --> 01:51:35.760]   safe or whatever.
[01:51:35.760 --> 01:51:42.080]   You can just go to mono price and get the cheapest dongles made because Type C is standard.
[01:51:42.080 --> 01:51:46.520]   This company hub plus is going to make something that plugs into the Type C and gives you another
[01:51:46.520 --> 01:51:52.760]   Type C. It looks like a mini display port, another full size USB, an SD card reader.
[01:51:52.760 --> 01:51:55.080]   This thing's crazy.
[01:51:55.080 --> 01:51:57.840]   And it's color-demached.
[01:51:57.840 --> 01:52:00.320]   They say it'll be out in June.
[01:52:00.320 --> 01:52:01.960]   I find that hard to believe.
[01:52:01.960 --> 01:52:06.440]   But maybe they've already made it because the Kickstarter project itself still has three
[01:52:06.440 --> 01:52:07.440]   weeks to go.
[01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:08.840]   They've raised their goals.
[01:52:08.840 --> 01:52:09.840]   35,000.
[01:52:09.840 --> 01:52:10.840]   They've raised 411,000.
[01:52:10.840 --> 01:52:19.920]   Two USB-C ports, an SD card reader, mini display port, three USB-3 charging ports.
[01:52:19.920 --> 01:52:22.280]   And it's got a battery in it.
[01:52:22.280 --> 01:52:23.960]   So you could use it to charge your phone.
[01:52:23.960 --> 01:52:24.960]   Yeah.
[01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:25.960]   That's crazy.
[01:52:25.960 --> 01:52:26.960]   It's pretty clever.
[01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:30.760]   I immediately ordered one because I'm a complete sucker.
[01:52:30.760 --> 01:52:36.040]   I believe anything I read on Kickstarter, I believe.
[01:52:36.040 --> 01:52:37.200]   One thing on Apple TV.
[01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:39.960]   So if we could go back to that, just go back to Apple TV.
[01:52:39.960 --> 01:52:42.240]   I'm anywhere you want to go.
[01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:43.240]   Cool.
[01:52:43.240 --> 01:52:49.360]   So I've heard the same thing that it is not likely to be released.
[01:52:49.360 --> 01:52:52.840]   It's more that it probably has been delayed till the fall.
[01:52:52.840 --> 01:52:59.600]   They'll talk about it certainly in some way or another, I would think, at WWDC.
[01:52:59.600 --> 01:53:03.680]   But I've been hearing that it's probably going to be delayed till the fall.
[01:53:03.680 --> 01:53:08.040]   And the interesting thing, one of the reasons that that probably matters is because of HomeKit,
[01:53:08.040 --> 01:53:10.240]   that's another thing that we're talking about.
[01:53:10.240 --> 01:53:11.680]   That was going to be the hub, wasn't it?
[01:53:11.680 --> 01:53:13.480]   Or at least we thought it might be the hub.
[01:53:13.480 --> 01:53:20.480]   So in one way or another, there's going to be important ways that HomeKit integrates
[01:53:20.480 --> 01:53:22.220]   with it.
[01:53:22.220 --> 01:53:26.440]   Not exactly sure what the details of that will be, of course.
[01:53:26.440 --> 01:53:29.360]   But it could be that it's part of the security package.
[01:53:29.360 --> 01:53:32.800]   It could be that it's the hub so that you don't need another hub.
[01:53:32.800 --> 01:53:39.000]   With all these home security things, you need some kind of hub like with Wink or SmartThings
[01:53:39.000 --> 01:53:42.320]   or Belkin Mimo, these others.
[01:53:42.320 --> 01:53:48.560]   It's the Wild West with Home Automation and Smart Home connected home stuff right now.
[01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:53.800]   And so Apple's going to make a big play, is making a big play with that with HomeKit.
[01:53:53.800 --> 01:53:57.360]   Google, we're likely going to hear what their play is.
[01:53:57.360 --> 01:53:59.360]   I think in the end, it probably is--
[01:53:59.360 --> 01:54:01.440]   Microsoft, too, though, for again.
[01:54:01.440 --> 01:54:03.800]   And Microsoft, too.
[01:54:03.800 --> 01:54:08.640]   But I do think in the end-- and Microsoft has a leg up in the sense because of Xbox.
[01:54:08.640 --> 01:54:12.640]   There are already a lot of Xboxes in the home.
[01:54:12.640 --> 01:54:17.400]   So maybe they could turn the Xbox somehow into a hub.
[01:54:17.400 --> 01:54:23.760]   But I think it's more likely that Apple and Google become big players in this.
[01:54:23.760 --> 01:54:30.480]   Because mobile is going to be huge in using mobile to interact with the Smart Home.
[01:54:30.480 --> 01:54:32.480]   And so it's going to be really interesting to watch.
[01:54:32.480 --> 01:54:38.320]   And just people keep in mind with the Apple TV thing that HomeKit is--
[01:54:38.320 --> 01:54:43.680]   that they are riding shotgun on whatever happens with Apple TV.
[01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:49.520]   The local TV thing is important, but also it's got an important function for whatever
[01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:51.800]   their HomeKit plans are as well.
[01:54:51.800 --> 01:54:54.040]   Let's take a break.
[01:54:54.040 --> 01:54:59.000]   Jason Heiner is here from CBS Interactive and the Tech Republic.
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:03.440]   Oh, and JJ Stone from Place Parts Unknown.
[01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:05.000]   The rest place is unknown.
[01:55:05.000 --> 01:55:06.520]   Yeah, soon.
[01:55:06.520 --> 01:55:09.400]   Call those ladies at the pool who will soon be there.
[01:55:09.400 --> 01:55:10.600]   I just sent a text message.
[01:55:10.600 --> 01:55:11.360]   I already printed it.
[01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:11.880]   We're almost done.
[01:55:11.880 --> 01:55:13.640]   We're wrapping them up.
[01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:20.480]   And of course, always wonderful to have our neighbor now, Jason Snell, from SixColors.com.
[01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:23.160]   Our show today brought to you by something you love, Jason Audible.com.
[01:55:23.160 --> 01:55:24.680]   We love those audio books.
[01:55:24.680 --> 01:55:25.920]   Oh, I got a book for you.
[01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:26.920]   You got a book for me?
[01:55:26.920 --> 01:55:27.280]   All right.
[01:55:27.280 --> 01:55:28.960]   Listen, because here's the thing.
[01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:30.880]   We're going to give you two free books.
[01:55:30.880 --> 01:55:33.920]   So listen, because this may be one of them that you want to listen to.
[01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:34.960]   Audible.
[01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:37.960]   I'm right now I'm listening to the other land series.
[01:55:37.960 --> 01:55:41.320]   Former Apple engineer who became a science fiction author.
[01:55:41.320 --> 01:55:42.560]   Is it Tad Williams?
[01:55:42.560 --> 01:55:44.080]   Is that right?
[01:55:44.080 --> 01:55:45.760]   It's really good.
[01:55:45.760 --> 01:55:48.120]   John Slonina said I had to get these books.
[01:55:48.120 --> 01:55:48.800]   It's a trilogy.
[01:55:48.800 --> 01:55:50.760]   It just came out in Audible.
[01:55:50.760 --> 01:55:55.600]   It's about a future where VR is four books, where VR is everywhere.
[01:55:55.600 --> 01:55:59.400]   The world has gotten used to the notion of being able to go into a VR world.
[01:55:59.400 --> 01:56:02.280]   And if you have enough money, you can really experience even things like you could eat
[01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:03.520]   food.
[01:56:03.520 --> 01:56:05.160]   But everybody's common.
[01:56:05.160 --> 01:56:06.560]   It's commonplace.
[01:56:06.560 --> 01:56:10.280]   It's normal, but is it safe?
[01:56:10.280 --> 01:56:12.560]   Things start happening.
[01:56:12.560 --> 01:56:15.480]   The city of Golden Shadow that's where I am right now, other land book one.
[01:56:15.480 --> 01:56:16.480]   I love science fiction.
[01:56:16.480 --> 01:56:20.600]   I love science fiction that talks about a world that I dream of being in like a world
[01:56:20.600 --> 01:56:21.800]   where VR is ubiquitous.
[01:56:21.800 --> 01:56:24.400]   Because I love thinking about what would that mean?
[01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:25.400]   How would that be?
[01:56:25.400 --> 01:56:28.200]   I'll never live in that world, but at least I can live there vicariously.
[01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:31.040]   The nice thing about Audible is you can listen to these books and they're mic movies in
[01:56:31.040 --> 01:56:32.320]   your mind that come alive.
[01:56:32.320 --> 01:56:34.560]   You're there.
[01:56:34.560 --> 01:56:36.120]   And I listen when I drive.
[01:56:36.120 --> 01:56:40.000]   I listen when I do the dishes on the treadmill, working out.
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:41.560]   I love Audible.
[01:56:41.560 --> 01:56:44.440]   And it's actually good for you because it makes you work out more.
[01:56:44.440 --> 01:56:47.760]   It makes you clean the house more.
[01:56:47.760 --> 01:56:51.320]   It reduces your stress if you have a bad commute.
[01:56:51.320 --> 01:56:55.240]   We're going to get you two books when you go to audible.com/twit2.
[01:56:55.240 --> 01:56:56.240]   Two books.
[01:56:56.240 --> 01:56:57.240]   Your first month is free.
[01:56:57.240 --> 01:56:58.240]   Your first two books are free.
[01:56:58.240 --> 01:57:01.040]   Cancel any time in that first 30 days.
[01:57:01.040 --> 01:57:04.360]   You don't pay a penny, but those books are yours to keep forever.
[01:57:04.360 --> 01:57:06.880]   Aren't they making a ready player one into a movie?
[01:57:06.880 --> 01:57:07.880]   They are.
[01:57:07.880 --> 01:57:08.880]   I think I heard that.
[01:57:08.880 --> 01:57:09.880]   That would be a good one.
[01:57:09.880 --> 01:57:13.680]   Ernest Klein's classic read by Will Wheaton before the movie comes out.
[01:57:13.680 --> 01:57:14.680]   I see.
[01:57:14.680 --> 01:57:15.680]   I don't know.
[01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:16.680]   Everybody has different opinion on this.
[01:57:16.680 --> 01:57:17.680]   I'm of the strong opinion.
[01:57:17.680 --> 01:57:20.640]   Always read the book before you go see the movie because the movie is going to spoil it.
[01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:23.200]   There's an unknown director working on that.
[01:57:23.200 --> 01:57:24.200]   Steven Spielberg.
[01:57:24.200 --> 01:57:25.200]   I've heard of him.
[01:57:25.200 --> 01:57:26.200]   Oh, wow.
[01:57:26.200 --> 01:57:27.200]   Oh, wow.
[01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:28.200]   Just a little Lisa.
[01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:29.200]   He's not producing it.
[01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:30.200]   He's actually directing it.
[01:57:30.200 --> 01:57:31.200]   Wow.
[01:57:31.200 --> 01:57:32.200]   That'll be cool.
[01:57:32.200 --> 01:57:33.200]   What are you reading?
[01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:34.520]   The Goblin Emperor.
[01:57:34.520 --> 01:57:35.520]   I just finished it.
[01:57:35.520 --> 01:57:36.520]   I like the name.
[01:57:36.520 --> 01:57:37.520]   It's so great.
[01:57:37.520 --> 01:57:42.840]   It's obviously a fantasy novel, but it's not like the plot is basically the main character
[01:57:42.840 --> 01:57:50.400]   is this completely unknown fourth son of the current emperor of the elf empire or whatever.
[01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:55.200]   There's a Zeppelin accident or was it on purpose?
[01:57:55.200 --> 01:58:00.080]   He is suddenly thrust into being the emperor of this entire thing.
[01:58:00.080 --> 01:58:02.080]   Nobody likes him.
[01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:05.160]   There might be assassination attempts and there might be conspiracies.
[01:58:05.160 --> 01:58:06.720]   Who reads the weirdest stuff?
[01:58:06.720 --> 01:58:08.560]   This was nominated for the Nebula Awards.
[01:58:08.560 --> 01:58:11.360]   Best signed by the Nomulated for the Hugo Award for Best Signed by the Marvel.
[01:58:11.360 --> 01:58:13.640]   Is it fantasy or is it Santa Fantasy?
[01:58:13.640 --> 01:58:16.480]   It's fantasy, but there's very little magic.
[01:58:16.480 --> 01:58:19.800]   There's not a lot of like, it's not like sword fighting and things like that.
[01:58:19.800 --> 01:58:24.600]   It really is about this character learning to be in charge and navigating his way when
[01:58:24.600 --> 01:58:27.600]   he's completely ill-prepared to becoming the leader.
[01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:31.000]   And I read it because it was nominated and I'm trying to read all the nominees.
[01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:32.000]   You know what?
[01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:33.000]   It's great.
[01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:34.000]   I really like it.
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:38.160]   And it's got lots of weirdly spelled words that were invented by the writer.
[01:58:38.160 --> 01:58:40.880]   Perfect for audible because somebody else's problem.
[01:58:40.880 --> 01:58:43.720]   To figure out how to pronounce all those words.
[01:58:43.720 --> 01:58:44.720]   You don't have to read them.
[01:58:44.720 --> 01:58:46.840]   Alright, I'm adding it to my wish list.
[01:58:46.840 --> 01:58:47.840]   It's really surprising.
[01:58:47.840 --> 01:58:49.400]   I got a couple.
[01:58:49.400 --> 01:58:50.400]   Okay.
[01:58:50.400 --> 01:58:51.400]   You just tricked you.
[01:58:51.400 --> 01:58:52.400]   Jason Heiner.
[01:58:52.400 --> 01:58:55.480]   The good thing about this Goblin Empire Emperor is not a trilogy.
[01:58:55.480 --> 01:58:58.880]   No, the author says it's standalone and she doesn't even plan a sequel.
[01:58:58.880 --> 01:58:59.880]   Thank you.
[01:58:59.880 --> 01:59:00.880]   Which makes me sad because I liked a lot.
[01:59:00.880 --> 01:59:02.480]   No, but you know, I'm not a series.
[01:59:02.480 --> 01:59:03.480]   I'm already, it's such a commitment.
[01:59:03.480 --> 01:59:04.480]   Not the one of ten.
[01:59:04.480 --> 01:59:05.480]   Other land, four books.
[01:59:05.480 --> 01:59:06.480]   It's a commitment.
[01:59:06.480 --> 01:59:07.480]   Yeah.
[01:59:07.480 --> 01:59:08.480]   What do you got Jason?
[01:59:08.480 --> 01:59:09.980]   I got two.
[01:59:09.980 --> 01:59:11.800]   David McCullough has a new book, The Right Brothers.
[01:59:11.800 --> 01:59:12.800]   Oh, I know.
[01:59:12.800 --> 01:59:13.800]   I can't wait to hear that.
[01:59:13.800 --> 01:59:14.960]   Love David McCullough.
[01:59:14.960 --> 01:59:17.200]   But I thought, you know, this story's been out there, right?
[01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:18.720]   What more, what could you do?
[01:59:18.720 --> 01:59:20.960]   What more could you do with that story?
[01:59:20.960 --> 01:59:24.520]   But it started reading it just completely hooked, completely hooked.
[01:59:24.520 --> 01:59:26.440]   And it's so good.
[01:59:26.440 --> 01:59:28.120]   And he reads it too.
[01:59:28.120 --> 01:59:29.720]   And he has such a great voice.
[01:59:29.720 --> 01:59:30.720]   He is the best.
[01:59:30.720 --> 01:59:35.440]   If oh, you know, he often doesn't do his unabridged versions because I guess he's busy.
[01:59:35.440 --> 01:59:39.960]   But boy, if you can listen to David McCullough read a book together, they said side by side
[01:59:39.960 --> 01:59:45.540]   on the back porch steps of the right family home on a small side street.
[01:59:45.540 --> 01:59:47.940]   You've heard his voice in many documentaries.
[01:59:47.940 --> 01:59:51.900]   He's a great historian, but he's also one of the best narrators around.
[01:59:51.900 --> 01:59:53.460]   Oh, okay.
[01:59:53.460 --> 01:59:54.460]   Good choice.
[01:59:54.460 --> 01:59:55.780]   He's a great book.
[01:59:55.780 --> 01:59:56.780]   It's about innovation, right?
[01:59:56.780 --> 02:00:03.420]   Tune it's about that turn of the century where, and this is, it's funny because this has such
[02:00:03.420 --> 02:00:08.780]   important implications as we think about the ways that some of the ways we think about
[02:00:08.780 --> 02:00:10.460]   the future, some of these technologies, right?
[02:00:10.460 --> 02:00:15.200]   Because you go back and you think of the assumptions, you see the assumptions that they had then,
[02:00:15.200 --> 02:00:17.540]   which was like, okay, these guys are flying.
[02:00:17.540 --> 02:00:19.420]   That means this is the way everybody's going to travel.
[02:00:19.420 --> 02:00:20.840]   It was kind of like the flying car thing.
[02:00:20.840 --> 02:00:25.960]   It was like everybody's just going to have a plane and they're going to fly everywhere.
[02:00:25.960 --> 02:00:27.960]   They're going to fly the grocery store.
[02:00:27.960 --> 02:00:28.960]   You're going to fly.
[02:00:28.960 --> 02:00:29.960]   It's a future.
[02:00:29.960 --> 02:00:30.960]   Yeah.
[02:00:30.960 --> 02:00:31.960]   And that's the future.
[02:00:31.960 --> 02:00:33.260]   And the funny thing was the car was just happening, right?
[02:00:33.260 --> 02:00:34.260]   So it was like, wow.
[02:00:34.260 --> 02:00:38.160]   We had the horse and like, now we've got the car and now we've got the plane.
[02:00:38.160 --> 02:00:42.800]   They were making these huge leaps in this very short span of time.
[02:00:42.800 --> 02:00:47.580]   So not unlike the way we have with certain communication technologies right now.
[02:00:47.580 --> 02:00:51.300]   And so I found that really interesting, just looking at and thinking about the ways, the
[02:00:51.300 --> 02:00:55.640]   assumptions that we're making about things and the ways that we always make assumptions
[02:00:55.640 --> 02:00:57.640]   about what does this mean for the future.
[02:00:57.640 --> 02:00:59.640]   So I thought that was, that one's super cool.
[02:00:59.640 --> 02:01:05.120]   And then also that Elon Musk, Elon Musk, but it just came out too.
[02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:06.120]   So I've been listening to both of those.
[02:01:06.120 --> 02:01:08.720]   Actually, it's going to be on triangulation, I think next week.
[02:01:08.720 --> 02:01:09.720]   So that's great.
[02:01:09.720 --> 02:01:11.400]   Yeah, I can't wait to talk about.
[02:01:11.400 --> 02:01:12.760]   He's done a great job with that book.
[02:01:12.760 --> 02:01:14.200]   Some amazing stuff.
[02:01:14.200 --> 02:01:15.200]   Yeah.
[02:01:15.200 --> 02:01:16.200]   Wait.
[02:01:16.200 --> 02:01:17.200]   Okay.
[02:01:17.200 --> 02:01:18.200]   Good.
[02:01:18.200 --> 02:01:19.200]   Excellent.
[02:01:19.200 --> 02:01:20.200]   Both of those are fantastic.
[02:01:20.200 --> 02:01:23.160]   Between that and trying to, you know, use my, my Apple watch to make sure I get all my
[02:01:23.160 --> 02:01:27.160]   activity and how they go with all kinds of walks so that I can listen to audio books and
[02:01:27.160 --> 02:01:30.360]   make sure I reach my, my activity meter.
[02:01:30.360 --> 02:01:33.240]   I would love all you can see everybody loves audible.
[02:01:33.240 --> 02:01:34.240]   The Jurassic Park.
[02:01:34.240 --> 02:01:39.760]   I can't wait to see the new movie and they've re-released.
[02:01:39.760 --> 02:01:43.400]   This is actually a new audible recording of Jurassic Park.
[02:01:43.400 --> 02:01:45.160]   I guess there never was an audio book.
[02:01:45.160 --> 02:01:46.640]   I was read by Scott Brick.
[02:01:46.640 --> 02:01:48.120]   One of the best.
[02:01:48.120 --> 02:01:49.120]   Yep.
[02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:51.200]   So there's another one.
[02:01:51.200 --> 02:01:56.720]   You only get two only audible.com/twit2 get your first two books free.
[02:01:56.720 --> 02:01:58.480]   You're going to, you'll thank us for it later.
[02:01:58.480 --> 02:01:59.480]   Honest.
[02:01:59.480 --> 02:02:00.480]   Trust me.
[02:02:00.480 --> 02:02:03.240]   Owen, the women await.
[02:02:03.240 --> 02:02:06.920]   A pool party without Owen JJ.
[02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:08.120]   Do you come on, tell me the truth.
[02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:09.120]   Do you do the cannonball?
[02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:10.120]   I'm over here.
[02:02:10.120 --> 02:02:11.120]   Do you do the cannonball?
[02:02:11.120 --> 02:02:12.120]   Do you get everybody wet?
[02:02:12.120 --> 02:02:13.120]   Oh, hold on, Gilett.
[02:02:13.120 --> 02:02:14.120]   I think the rescue team's coming.
[02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:18.120]   He's almost out of his glass prison.
[02:02:18.120 --> 02:02:19.120]   Help.
[02:02:19.120 --> 02:02:20.120]   I'm right here.
[02:02:20.120 --> 02:02:21.120]   Zod.
[02:02:21.120 --> 02:02:22.120]   He's down there.
[02:02:22.120 --> 02:02:24.960]   Somebody save me.
[02:02:24.960 --> 02:02:27.520]   Do you do the, are you going to do a cannonball when you get there?
[02:02:27.520 --> 02:02:29.000]   Just let them know you're there.
[02:02:29.000 --> 02:02:31.680]   Now the pool's heated and I want to keep the water in the pool.
[02:02:31.680 --> 02:02:35.560]   So when I get to doing cannonballs, tidal waves, a foot, it's not safe.
[02:02:35.560 --> 02:02:37.480]   It's not a safe situation.
[02:02:37.480 --> 02:02:40.880]   Grab your children and come to JJ.
[02:02:40.880 --> 02:02:43.920]   Everybody out of the pool.
[02:02:43.920 --> 02:02:46.160]   I know cannonballs for me.
[02:02:46.160 --> 02:02:47.880]   And I don't get thrown in the pool either because I'm too big.
[02:02:47.880 --> 02:02:49.040]   I do all the throwing.
[02:02:49.040 --> 02:02:50.040]   Yeah.
[02:02:50.040 --> 02:02:51.040]   No, you're in charge.
[02:02:51.040 --> 02:02:52.040]   Large and in charge.
[02:02:52.040 --> 02:02:54.400]   It's @ohdoc.
[02:02:54.400 --> 02:02:58.640]   T-A-H on the Twitter, oh, daktah.
[02:02:58.640 --> 02:03:01.600]   He doesn't even know where it comes from.
[02:03:01.600 --> 02:03:02.600]   I do know where it comes from.
[02:03:02.600 --> 02:03:03.600]   Do you?
[02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:04.600]   Where does it come from?
[02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:06.320]   You told me specifically where it came from.
[02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:07.320]   Yes.
[02:03:07.320 --> 02:03:08.640]   You didn't know what I told you though.
[02:03:08.640 --> 02:03:11.760]   And I was in front of my friend about it and he finally admitted that that's where it came
[02:03:11.760 --> 02:03:12.760]   from.
[02:03:12.760 --> 02:03:17.240]   Oh, a friend called you that when I was in the eighth grade, my buddy who's a big baseball
[02:03:17.240 --> 02:03:21.400]   freak called me that because I, oh, doctor, like I help everybody.
[02:03:21.400 --> 02:03:22.400]   I smart.
[02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:23.400]   I know everything.
[02:03:23.400 --> 02:03:24.400]   He's like, oh, doctor.
[02:03:24.400 --> 02:03:26.280]   And I was like, oh, that's cool.
[02:03:26.280 --> 02:03:27.280]   I haven't called myself.
[02:03:27.280 --> 02:03:28.280]   Oh, doc.
[02:03:28.280 --> 02:03:30.680]   This is eighth grade and I've been credit in Brian Doreko for it.
[02:03:30.680 --> 02:03:33.880]   And then you came and ruined his dream because when I told him, he's like, how did you know
[02:03:33.880 --> 02:03:34.880]   that?
[02:03:34.880 --> 02:03:39.240]   I'm like, well, somebody told me that old guy who used to listen to old baseball games
[02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:41.480]   and then I pulled up the audio and he's like, oh, doctor.
[02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:42.680]   I'm like, that's me.
[02:03:42.680 --> 02:03:44.440]   He's very, I'm trying to remember now.
[02:03:44.440 --> 02:03:45.440]   It's very common.
[02:03:45.440 --> 02:03:47.880]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:03:47.880 --> 02:03:51.640]   I'm trying to think he was a whole, whole fan broadcast for the San Diego Padres.
[02:03:51.640 --> 02:03:52.640]   That was his catchphrase.
[02:03:52.640 --> 02:03:53.640]   Was it?
[02:03:53.640 --> 02:03:54.640]   Oh, doc.
[02:03:54.640 --> 02:03:56.640]   No, no, it goes back farther than that.
[02:03:56.640 --> 02:03:57.640]   Yeah.
[02:03:57.640 --> 02:03:58.640]   Okay.
