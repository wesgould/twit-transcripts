[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.120]   and Apple's new iPhone.
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.080]   Will it be a hit or a flop?

[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.800]   journalists in the world, starting all the way over
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.200]   to my right.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.600]   No, to my left.
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.840]   That way is left.
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.400]   With Dwight Silverman, you're usually over here, Dwight.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.680]   We flip-flopped you.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.400]   Dwight Silverman's from the Houston Chronicle
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.560]   and blogs.cron.com/tech.
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.520]   Hey, Dwight.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.560]   I'm so confused.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.920]   I'm reversed.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:48.840]   How are you, Leo?
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.120]   Very well.
[00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.080]   How are things in Houston?
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.800]   What's the weather like?
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.320]   Is it very hot and muggy?
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.160]   Actually, no, it has not been that hot.
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.560]   We have had a lot of rain and, in fact, floods and cooler
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.120]   weather while the breadbasket of the country
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.400]   bakes in 104 degree temperatures.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.240]   Wow.
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.920]   So it's been-- it's actually not too bad down here.
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.840]   And we also got named-- Houston got named
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.240]   by Forbes, the coolest city in America.
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.120]   And you can imagine the--
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.160]   What?
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.200]   Yes.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:16.800]   What?
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.400]   And not in temperature-wise.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.040]   It just is-- we're like super cool.
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.280]   Is it really cool in Houston?
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.240]   I always thought Houston was kind of a little--
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.960]   I don't know-- drab.
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.960]   Well, if you live outside the--
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:30.960]   There's like three loops around you.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.400]   The downtown is really cool.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.600]   Right.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.080]   The downtown area, right.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.240]   It's kind of-- Houston reminds me now
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.320]   of what Austin was in the '70s and '80s.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.720]   Yeah.
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.560]   Kind of this burgeoning arts and intellectual community.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.240]   And so it's kind of cool to be here right now.
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.760]   It really is.
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.000]   And it just exciting.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.040]   Yeah, because it's--
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.240]   I've never been outside of the--
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.480]   I'm into the Astrodome and I've been outside of the downtown.
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.600]   And that's just kind of a bland downtown--
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.560]   all the oil money, frankly.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.720]   But you are on the Gulf.
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.440]   I mean, it should have some-- there should be some cultural--
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.240]   There is.
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.520]   There's kind of the areas around downtown
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:05.560]   that's called the Montrose and Midtown and the Heights.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.680]   It's very much kind of an arts and intellectual community.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.920]   And it's really burgeoning at the moment.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:13.360]   I think you should do a festival.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.720]   You call it South by Southeastern.
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.720]   And it would be a little west of the east.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.280]   And I don't know.
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.760]   You could do so.
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.080]   I don't know.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.000]   Just take it over from Austin.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.960]   OK, I'm on it.
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.680]   Good to have you also from Time Magazine.
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.560]   And the technologizer, Harry McCracken, is here.
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.480]   Good to see you, Harry.
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.960]   Hey, Leo.
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:30.760]   Thanks for joining us.
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:31.120]   Thank you.
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.320]   Love it when you're in studio.
[00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.960]   Always fun.
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.440]   Your lovely wife is here, too.
[00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.080]   She's out there.
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.360]   I saw her somewhere.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.880]   She's out right in the corner.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:38.360]   She's hiding.
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.920]   There she is.
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.480]   Oh, you're in the living room.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.600]   All right.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.240]   We can't see her.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.800]   She's blocked.
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:43.560]   Also here.
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.560]   Ken Ray from--
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.280]   I want to say Rochester, but it's Buffalo.
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.960]   Here's Buffalo.
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.520]   Buffalo, New York.
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.320]   Good to have you, Ken.
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.320]   The coolest city in the world, according to Forbes.
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.720]   In the running, though--
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:58.920]   It may well be.
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.240]   You're near Niagara Falls.
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.560]   That's cool.
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.720]   We're very near Niagara Falls.
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.160]   Yeah.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.520]   And there's actually-- I mean, not that either of us
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.160]   is working for the Chamber of Commerce
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:08.280]   for our respective cities.
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.440]   But yeah, things are happening here.
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.920]   Sure.
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.440]   I kind of like to emphasize the fact
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.000]   that the people are from all over.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.760]   It's kind of fun that we get--
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.360]   because of Skype, we're able to talk to people
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.840]   all over the place.
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.400]   That is a very cool thing.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.960]   We're going to begin the show today with a special visit
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.400]   from the host of this week in Enterprise Tech
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.760]   and a regular on Twitch, a father Robert Ballester, who
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.720]   was at Defcon.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.880]   We've given you the special priest monitor there.
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.800]   I like it.
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:44.640]   Robert, welcome.
[00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.800]   You survived Defcon.
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.080]   Just barely.
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.240]   It was about 115 degrees inside and out.
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.080]   It was fantastic.
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.480]   Oy, yoy, yoy.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.520]   And of course-- and I know when Patrick Norton used
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.720]   to go to Defcon, he would never bring any technology with him.
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.520]   Did you not--
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.360]   Were you able to not get hacked is the question?
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.200]   I did not get hacked, but that's only because I basically
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.680]   turned everything off.
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.320]   Defcon wanted to establish a secure network.
[00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.280]   So they actually had two different Wi-Fi networks
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:15.520]   that people could log into.
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.720]   The first was actually quite secured.
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.600]   It had a VPN tunnel to the outside world,
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.040]   so no one else at the conference could see you.
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.120]   It was using WPA2, and you had to download a certificate.
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.560]   But even then, most of us didn't log in.
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.440]   They had a second network, which they called Free Range.
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.320]   And that was basically take your life into your own hands.
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.080]   Connect to this, and you will get hacked.
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.720]   There's a wall of shame, right, where people who get hacked
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.400]   get their stuff put up on the wall.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.160]   Absolutely.
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.560]   They call it the wall of sheep.
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.120]   It's a huge screen that they project up on the side of the wall.
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.320]   And in real time, it shows usernames and passwords
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.480]   of people who have transmitted their data.
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.640]   Do you have your badge still?
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:54.480]   I do, I do.
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:56.080]   Can you show us?
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:57.280]   It's plugged in right now.
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.800]   So this is known as an inhuman badge.
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.360]   So the human badges, which is what the attendees were wearing,
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.280]   were all white.
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:08.000]   And then you had speakers, vendors, artists, media, and goons.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.400]   And they had different colored badges
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.560]   that were called Inhuman.
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.480]   And actually, they did a fantastic thing today
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:15.160]   at this conference.
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.680]   They wanted to emphasize the social nature of the conference.
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.200]   In fact, several times, Dark Tangent, who runs the conference
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:24.680]   and lost, who actually created this,
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:27.760]   they wanted people to actually talk to someone else.
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.360]   They said, look, you're on your computer
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:31.240]   363 days a year.
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.320]   Why not go ahead and talk to someone who's real,
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.640]   standing next to you?
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.120]   And so what they did was they put a gaming aspect
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.480]   into the badge.
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.000]   There's a crypto challenge.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.280]   There was actually created by the lost in which the participants
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:49.960]   at the conference had to decipher a cryptological challenge.
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.640]   Well, it was embedded into the badges.
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:53.600]   You lost me, didn't you?
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.040]   No, but if you think--
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.040]   Oh.
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:57.760]   [GROWLING]
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.280]   You're a premonition.
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.800]   In fact.
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.680]   See, he's a priest, so he has early information.
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.440]   All right, we'll get Robert back.
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.560]   This is really cool, though.
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.120]   There were 21 total different shapes,
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.040]   21 unique styles.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:15.640]   Each of these is a circuit board running a propeller 32-bit
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.840]   multi-core processor with an infrared LED and receiver
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.680]   for badge-to-badged communication.
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.960]   This is, by the way, from the Parallax forums.
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.960]   Ken Gracie writing about the DEF CON badges.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.920]   A bank of eight LEDs, USB circuit for data access
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:37.000]   and programming, each attendee receives two PS2 adapters
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.200]   and a VGA connector.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.720]   So it's kind of like the Raspberry Pi.
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:42.800]   This is a small computer.
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.080]   They can actually go to the hardware hacking village
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:48.280]   and turn their badge into a computer system.
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.720]   Three AAA batteries were supposedly
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:54.440]   could run the badge for the entire conference.
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:58.080]   And then at the DEF CON opening ceremony,
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.200]   they got information about the challenge.
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.000]   That's what Robert started to talk about before he was
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.520]   cut off by the NSA.
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:11.920]   And I guess this looks like a terminal
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:15.640]   that people are using to start that this is really cool.
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:18.520]   This is really, really, really cool.
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:18.880]   We're still--
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.000]   Have you been to DEF CON, Leo?
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:20.600]   I have not.
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:21.440]   I'm scared.
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.080]   Have you?
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:22.720]   I have not been.
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.040]   Anybody else?
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:25.040]   Jeff or Ken?
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:25.840]   Do I have your Ken?
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:26.920]   Have you been there?
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:27.440]   No.
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.240]   Haven't been.
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.200]   But my colleagues go every year.
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.320]   I was going to go last year.
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:31.920]   But--
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.960]   You said your colleague got hacked this year?
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:34.520]   Yes.
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:35.520]   Yes.
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.600]   And what's-- he is the IT director and head of security
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.400]   for his company.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.200]   So I don't know how--
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.040]   I'm hoping that it was ironic that he actually
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.320]   was making a joke, but it didn't look like it to me.
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.960]   His Twitter account was starting to post some garbage.
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:50.520]   Yes.
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:51.400]   I'm scared.
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:53.360]   And Patrick always took it very seriously.
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.320]   He said he would never go with a computer,
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.680]   because he knew he'd just do a little too.
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.480]   Well, if I would go, I would go with a computer that,
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:02.800]   essentially, was wiped clean and dedicated only
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:03.920]   for use there.
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:04.120]   Right.
[00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.760]   It may actually be easier with something like an iPad
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.280]   or a smartphone.
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:11.200]   If you can get on your own networks,
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.600]   your broadband network.
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:15.040]   But yeah, to log into the free range,
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.840]   I think that would be a real challenge
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.720]   to stay un-hacked on that.
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.080]   Yeah.
[00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:19.680]   That would be fun.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:20.000]   Damn it.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.840]   If you go with your own LTE connection,
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:24.240]   you turn the Wi-Fi off.
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.720]   How much trouble could you get it?
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.280]   I hope you would be safe, but I don't know.
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:29.440]   Maybe you wouldn't think.
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.280]   So there is Robert with his badge.
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.560]   Did you ever figure out what the hack was, Robert?
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:35.600]   Yes, actually.
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.200]   So what you had to do, you would synchronize your badge
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.680]   with as many other people as you possibly could.
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:43.960]   And every time you synchronize the badge,
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.400]   you got another bit.
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:47.840]   And at the very end, it would unlock the next crypto
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.560]   key for the challenge.
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.520]   And it would tell you where you should look in order
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:52.960]   to go to the next level.
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:56.400]   It was a little bit of a Ready Player One in the game.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.040]   Sounds like fun.
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:00.320]   So tell me what we learned, because every year at Defcon
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.640]   and Black Hat before it, Black Hat
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:07.240]   is the official kind of more business-oriented convention.
[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.360]   And then Defcon is the more hacker-oriented convention.
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:12.360]   But every year, people bring their best exploits.
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:13.240]   And you hear about ulcers?
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.760]   I remember we heard about how people
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:18.320]   could use a power port to break in the motel room
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.680]   electronic locks.
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.520]   What else did we learn at Defcon?
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:25.200]   Well, this was an interesting year,
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:30.200]   because I think the most exploity, if I can coin a term,
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.200]   presentation was NFC.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.640]   And it was shown how you could basically
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:39.040]   hack the NFC of an NFC phone or an NFC tablet
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.800]   in order to take over the device.
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.840]   But the presenter made it very clear.
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.560]   And he showed us in the example that this
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.640]   was a proof of concept.
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.120]   The device would basically have to be in a state
[00:11:49.120 --> 00:11:52.200]   that it would never be in a million years in the wild.
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:55.280]   So I think Defcon this year moved a little bit away
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.560]   from the exploits, because we had a special visitor.
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:12:02.800]   It was General B Alexander, the head of the NSA.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.840]   Whoa, actually first time there.
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:05.720]   Yeah.
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:06.920]   That's so strange.
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.960]   He came in to actually speak to Defcon.
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:09.480]   Wow.
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:13.600]   He's become a friend of the leader of Defcon, Dark Tangent.
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:16.000]   And he basically said, look, we know you're going to hack.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.200]   We know that you are some of the most skilled hackers
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.360]   in the country.
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.120]   So if you're going to hack, why not hack for your country?
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.040]   So there was a little bit of a raw, raw pitch.
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.040]   I'm not really sure how that went over the ground.
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:27.080]   I kind of like that, though.
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.440]   I think that's not a bad idea.
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.880]   I think that nothing good can come of a friendship
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.640]   between the director of the NSA and Dark Tangent, however.
[00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.120]   Right.
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:38.400]   But I think that that's actually a good call to hackers
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.800]   to say, well, you're going to hack.
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.920]   Why don't you do it for good, not evil?
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:44.560]   Right.
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.920]   And they actually had a table in the vendor area
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.360]   where you could get more information.
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:52.200]   And it was empty for the first three or so hours
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:52.800]   of the conference.
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.240]   But then people started trickling over to the table
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:58.120]   just to get information, some were ridiculing them.
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:01.520]   But I think there's actually a general interest
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.120]   in doing something constructive.
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:07.000]   Or perhaps speaking a bit more conspiratorially,
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.520]   they just wanted access to all the toys that the NSA has.
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:13.200]   Well, traditionally at Defcon and Black Hat,
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.040]   there's always been feds there.
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:17.400]   It was always kind of where feds and hackers would meet
[00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:19.800]   a lot of FBI agents and so forth.
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.640]   Because they're looking for information
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:22.600]   about what's going on, too.
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.840]   They want to keep their ear to the ground.
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:25.480]   Right.
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.440]   And Alexander made it very clear.
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.520]   He had a presentation before Congress earlier this year
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:35.440]   in which he said, look, if you want us to be able to compete
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:39.240]   with cyber hacking, cyber cracking, and cyber terrorism,
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.680]   we need to recruit the best.
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:41.480]   And guess what?
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.240]   The best are found at events like Defcon.
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:44.720]   Yeah.
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:47.640]   So we need a little bit of leeway in bringing these people
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:48.440]   into the fold.
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:49.680]   They do a spot the Fed.
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:50.600]   Did they do spot the Fed?
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.520]   Because it was too hard to find the Fed this time.
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.960]   The spot the Fed contest.
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:57.360]   General Alexander was off limits for spot the Fed.
[00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:59.160]   OK.
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.720]   But yeah, they do it every year.
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:03.480]   If any of you have never been to Defcon,
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:05.240]   I think the best way I could describe it
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:09.680]   is picture CES crossed with South by Southwest,
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.200]   crossed with Burning Man.
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.440]   I mean, that's really honestly the best combination
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.000]   I could think of.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.480]   That sounds so awesome.
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.560]   But I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:21.720]   I was just wondering if the challenge, the badge challenge,
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.280]   you said somebody did solve it?
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:24.560]   Or--
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:26.520]   Yes, it's been solved.
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:30.560]   The weird thing was when we got the badges the day before,
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.880]   there were a group of us who sat outside the hallway for what's
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:35.920]   called the Hardware Hacking Village, which
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:38.320]   is the official place where people go to modify things
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.720]   and learn how to solder.
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.040]   Well, there was about 12 of us.
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.240]   And we just started hacking through the code.
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.760]   We dumped the binaries of the badges.
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.560]   It helped that I had a press badge,
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:48.960]   because my code was different.
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:52.360]   So we were able to do differential analysis.
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:56.000]   But we figured out about 60% of the contest
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.400]   before the contest even started.
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.840]   That's sort of what you get at DevCon.
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.720]   And what we found out was the crypto challenge
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.160]   wasn't just on the badge.
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.520]   This pointed you to a page that said
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.440]   that the lanyard, that the crypt--
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:09.440]   Oh!
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.120]   --that the badge was attached to.
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.440]   Was actually part of the challenge.
[00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:12.960]   Awesome.
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.040]   Which then told you that the floors, the way
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.920]   that the floors were arranged and the decals on the floors,
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:18.960]   were part of the challenge.
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:19.480]   Awesome.
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.960]   Which told you that the signs were part of the challenge.
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:25.120]   It was this wonderful Easter egg hunt of crypto.
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:27.560]   It sounds like this is a very fun conference.
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:28.880]   This is the 20th DevCon.
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.920]   Have you been to others?
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:33.520]   The last one I went to was DevCon 1.
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:33.880]   What?
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:35.040]   Wrong.
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.760]   So were you a little baby hacker then?
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:40.120]   I wasn't even in the seminary yet.
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:42.400]   So these sort of bookends of Hackeray here.
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.600]   Wow, that's so cool.
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:48.280]   And did anybody think you were a fan?
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:51.280]   There's actually a very high ranking DevCon personality
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:53.600]   who goes by the nickname Priest.
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:54.080]   So--
[00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.520]   They thought you were me.
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:58.640]   Well, the people who were new thought that I might be Priest.
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:00.840]   The people who had gone to DevCon before and knew
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:01.840]   what Priest looked like.
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:06.720]   He's incredibly tall and incredibly not olive-skinned.
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.520]   They thought that I was trying to impersonate Priest.
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.880]   So I actually had a goon who threatened to beat me up.
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:12.440]   That was kind of fun.
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.320]   He had a goon badge.
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:15.520]   He had a goon badge.
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:17.720]   Oh yeah, goons are these people who--
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:18.800]   they're volunteers.
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:19.800]   They're security guys.
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:20.600]   They're security guys.
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.960]   They set up-- they basically do anything the organizers
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:24.520]   asked them to do.
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:25.720]   Absolutely fantastic.
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.680]   I mean, if any of those goons are watching right now,
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.760]   you people keep that show running.
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:31.560]   If it wasn't for you, DevCon wouldn't happen.
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:32.960]   That is so cool.
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.240]   Well, I'm glad you went.
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.440]   Somebody's saying Twitch should have coverage of DevCon.
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:37.680]   Well, yeah, we did.
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.560]   It's called Robert Balaser, our host for--
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:41.040]   And?
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:41.880]   Yes?
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:45.600]   We will be bringing in a little bit for "Twiet,"
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.080]   some of the DevCon coverage.
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:50.320]   The problem with DevCon is they're incredibly
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.320]   sensitive about taking pictures and video.
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.640]   They're very, very shy.
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.200]   Do you have anything you can show us?
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.760]   I do.
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.400]   Unfortunately, I wasn't able to render it--
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:16:59.960]   That's OK.
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:01.400]   --save it for "Twiet."
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:02.640]   I'll save it for "Twiet."
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:04.360]   And we had sent you with a mission,
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:06.200]   which was to get us a Raspberry Pi.
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.840]   What happened?
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:09.120]   It was mission aborted.
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.200]   I was actually in line.
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:11.960]   I showed up at 8 o'clock in the morning--
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:12.560]   Thanks for, Robert.
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:14.520]   --for a vendor table that wouldn't open until 10.
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:15.320]   Wow.
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:17.960]   And because I figured there's 12,000 people at the conference,
[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.760]   the 4,000 Raspberry Pi's will sell out like hotcakes.
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:21.200]   Yeah.
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.520]   We got in, and the Raspberry Pi table was empty.
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.320]   They didn't show up.
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:28.280]   Yeah.
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.720]   I think we scared them.
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:31.720]   I think they owe us a Raspberry Pi.
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:32.920]   They owe us a Raspberry Pi.
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:33.520]   Thank you, Robert.
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:36.400]   Robert Balaser is the host of this week in Enterprise Tech.
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:40.640]   Monday, 12 noon Pacific, 3 p.m. Eastern time,
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:47.240]   1900 UTC, you'll have full coverage of DevCon tomorrow.
[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:47.800]   Absolutely.
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:48.440]   Thanks, Robert.
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.960]   Great to talk to you.
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:50.680]   Great to talk to you, Leo.
[00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:51.180]   Thanks.
[00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:52.160]   Thanks to go for going to Dev.
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:53.400]   Actually, we have another assignment.
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.960]   You're going to Burning Man in September.
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.480]   You ready?
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:56.920]   I'm all set.
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:58.000]   And I will wear the collar.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:58.480]   OK.
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:00.560]   Maybe nothing else, but the collar.
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:02.600]   Absolutely.
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:04.240]   I don't think the Vatican knows about him.
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:08.360]   He's under cover.
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:09.080]   Thanks, Robert.
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:10.400]   Great to talk to you.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.640]   Take care.
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:12.080]   I love it.
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:12.760]   We're going to take a break.
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.040]   Come back with the top stories.
[00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.000]   We're going to talk about the Olympics and NBC
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:16.600]   botching it.
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:17.640]   Have you been following?
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.720]   There's a new Twitter account.
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:23.480]   NBC delayed their first tweet an hour ago breaking.
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:25.880]   American colonists announced independence.
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.720]   King to respond.
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:30.200]   We'll go.
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:33.200]   And more tweets to come.
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.560]   Should people be upset about what NBC is doing with the Olympics?
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:39.680]   And will this be the last non-internet Olympics?
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:42.080]   We'll also talk about--
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.200]   well, there's lots.
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.600]   Mountain Lion, I'm going to get the opinions of OS
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.000]   Ken, Mac OS Ken, and more.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.080]   But first to word from our friends at Citrix,
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:54.240]   who do the great go-to meeting product of meeting.
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:56.560]   Now, during the summertime, meeting is always tough.
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:57.320]   People are traveling.
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.320]   They're all about those staff meetings if possible.
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:02.720]   Sometimes you want to do a pitch to a clienties
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:03.440]   and cobblestone.
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:04.960]   Look, it's no problem.
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.160]   Fire up, go to meeting.
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:07.120]   Did he bring his iPad?
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:08.120]   Did she bring your iPhone?
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:09.600]   She could join that meeting.
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.200]   In fact, what's really cool, this new HD face is for you.
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.600]   Go to meetings always has screen sharing.
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:14.920]   It's best screen sharing out there.
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.960]   So you could show them the PowerPoint, the presentation.
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:21.360]   But now, if you're on a PC or a Mac with a camera,
[00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.320]   you get the video, and really good video.
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.760]   I mean, just superb video.
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:27.400]   They even support the iPads.
[00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:30.120]   So you can go to a meeting, attend a meeting on the iPad,
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.400]   send video, listen through the headphones,
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.960]   use the iPads, mic the whole thing, and you're there.
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:39.560]   Even if you're on vacation, go to meeting is a great solution.
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:41.760]   And now is a good time to try it free for 30 days.
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:42.880]   Here's what I want you to do.
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:45.320]   Visit the website, go to meeting.com.
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:48.160]   Click that orange, try it free button, smack dab
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.480]   in the middle there.
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:51.640]   And when they ask for a promo code,
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:54.320]   use our show title, Twit, right?
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:55.000]   That's all.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.840]   T-W-I-T right in there.
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:58.560]   And we'll get a little credit for it.
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:19:59.600]   We do appreciate that.
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.800]   And if you haven't tried it or you're
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.520]   looking for a great online meeting software,
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:06.760]   there is none better than go to meeting.
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:09.120]   Visit them online, go to meeting.com.
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.440]   Use a promo code, Twit.
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.400]   And do try it with the camera, because I think
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:13.480]   you'll be blown away.
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:15.800]   Somebody was-- when you were given the chat a tour--
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.240]   Chad does a tour in Nevada.
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:19.760]   I invite our-- once again, a great studio audience.
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.040]   Thank you all for being here.
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:23.920]   At the end of the show, Chad's been given tours, right?
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:24.920]   Of the studio?
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:25.360]   Absolutely.
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.320]   You take him in the basement?
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:26.760]   Yep, yep.
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:27.520]   Show him everything.
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.520]   So somebody was here last week and said, well, why don't you
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.520]   go to meeting instead of Skype?
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:33.680]   And we talked to the engineers that go to meeting.
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:34.560]   They're working on it.
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:36.960]   But the problem right now is go to meeting what we want
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:38.520]   is one full screen of video.
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:41.800]   And go to meeting doesn't do that for the calls yet.
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:43.200]   But I think it's a matter of time.
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.320]   Go to meeting.com/--
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.560]   I'm sorry, offer code, Twit.
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:49.120]   Promo code, Twit.
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.480]   So who came here from the farthest way?
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:53.760]   Anybody from outside the US here today?
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.960]   Where are you from, sir?
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:56.920]   Montreal.
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:57.640]   Beautiful area.
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:58.960]   In the Captain America shirt.
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.240]   In a Captain America shirt.
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.360]   But-- Hey, America has--
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.320]   Is there--
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:05.160]   Is there a Captain Canada?
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.360]   No, no Captain Canada.
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:09.360]   Just Captain America.
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.720]   Anybody from farther than Montreal?
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:12.840]   All right, well, we welcome you all.
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:14.640]   There's about, I don't know, 15 people.
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:15.000]   It's nice.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.040]   If you want to come visit us and watch the shows,
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:19.840]   any of the shows live, please do come by.
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:20.400]   We're open.
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.640]   And we get people all through the week.
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:24.160]   It's really fun.
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.880]   Somebody in chat is pointing out Captain
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.400]   Kanak who has an actual character.
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:28.320]   Captain Kanak.
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:28.820]   Yes.
[00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:29.720]   There is a Captain Kanak.
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:30.220]   Yes.
[00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:31.200]   OK.
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.200]   Let me tell you, is Kanak kind of considered
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:36.720]   like a little bit of an insult, a little pejorative?
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:39.000]   I'm from the province of Quebec.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:39.560]   So--
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.040]   You're not crazy, but--
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:43.120]   Those angle of phones anyway.
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:44.560]   The hell with them?
[00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:46.440]   Actually, our IT guy, Russell Tammany,
[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:49.360]   was just came back from Quebec today,
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:51.520]   had a wonderful time in Montreal.
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:53.640]   And he said, thank goodness for the Francophones,
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.960]   because you've preserved this unique cultural identity.
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:59.440]   And it's just up the road to peace from Buffalo,
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.120]   where Ken Ray is currently having Skype trouble.
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:05.160]   And we'll get him back on in a minute.
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.960]   So I love the Olympics.
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:09.480]   The Summer Olympics to me are a wonderful event.
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:12.520]   But I have to say, I was a little disappointed Friday.
[00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:14.320]   I'm watching Twitter.
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:17.600]   Everybody's tweeting, there's James Bond, there's the queen.
[00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.720]   My god, they're forging the rings.
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.040]   And I'm thinking, I want to see this.
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:22.120]   I want to see this.
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:24.440]   And I went online, NBCOlympics.com,
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:27.000]   where they're doing streaming Olympics.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.360]   I did-- they said, well, sorry, you
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:33.880]   have to have a cable satellite or teleco connection that
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.800]   gets MSNBC and CNBC to qualify to watch this.
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:40.320]   I logged into my Xfinity account, and they said, no,
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.240]   we're not going to-- you know why we're not broadcasting
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.000]   the opening ceremony or streaming it live?
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.240]   It's too complex for the online audience.
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:48.840]   It's too difficult.
[00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:50.360]   This is the quote.
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:53.920]   NBC says-- they told the LA Times--
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:57.200]   the ceremonies are, quote, complex entertainment
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:01.560]   spectacles that do not translate well online,
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:05.640]   because they require context, which our award-winning production
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:09.000]   team will provide for the large prime time audiences that
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.920]   gather together to watch them.
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.840]   See, the web is better at context than TV ever will be,
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:14.880]   I think.
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.120]   If you watch it with a Twitter feed,
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:18.440]   you'll know more about what's going on than Matt
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:20.920]   Lauer and Meredith Vieira, who said, who the hell is Tim
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.320]   Berners-Lee, and what is he doing there?
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:25.000]   They literally-- and they made it--
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.520]   it was almost as if they were celebrating their ignorance.
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:30.840]   Meredith Vieira says--
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:33.880]   this is the cringe moment for me, because they had these LCD
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:36.200]   screens on the seats, which is cool.
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.280]   So even though people are sitting in the seats,
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:40.680]   they still can do display in the seats
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:42.000]   like they did in China at Beijing.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.080]   It was beautiful.
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:47.040]   She said, there are 70,000 LCD panels on these seats.
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:49.040]   I have no idea what that means.
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:53.280]   And it's like, does it not seem a little bit
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:55.960]   retro to say, oh, technology?
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:57.760]   I don't get it.
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:23:59.120]   Everybody gets it now, Meredith.
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:02.480]   It's no longer cool to admit that you're an ignorant
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:03.280]   of technology.
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:05.080]   I understand they don't know who Tim Berners-Lee is.
[00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:06.520]   I wouldn't expect that.
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:08.160]   I guess so, although you would think they might have been
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.280]   pre-briefed, if they were so important to us
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:12.960]   understanding what was going on.
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:15.440]   Even if you don't know who Tim Berners-Lee is,
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:18.920]   Danny Boyle decided to put him in the middle of the Olympic
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:19.600]   opening ceremony.
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.400]   Which I thought was great.
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:22.080]   No, that is great.
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:23.840]   But if you don't know who he is, maybe you're going to quiet
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:24.080]   about it.
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.080]   Maybe you go, and there's Tim Berners-Lee.
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:27.600]   Yeah.
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:28.920]   I mean, no, I don't know.
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.600]   I was thinking, OK, I know--
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.360]   Tim Berners-Lee, sir, Tim Berners-Lee's
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:34.000]   the man who invented the World Wide Web.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.920]   You can't put one person--
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.760]   you know, and say, this person invented the internet.
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:38.680]   There's too many people involved.
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:40.840]   But you can say one person invented the World Wide Web.
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:42.120]   And it's this guy.
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:43.480]   And he's British.
[00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:45.920]   And he's sitting there with the next cube, which I would have
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.000]   loved if they had said.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.160]   Oh, and Mr. Tim is typing on the original next cube
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:55.720]   computer that he invented the World Wide Web on.
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.440]   And he's going to tweet-- they didn't even understand
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:25:00.680]   that he was tweeting, that he's now going to tweet a message
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:03.080]   to the world via his cube.
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:03.960]   They didn't say any of that.
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.560]   They said, oh, we don't know who he is.
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:07.080]   They said Google him.
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:09.320]   Was there-- what's the thing?
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:12.240]   This was what is too complex?
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.480]   Holy cow.
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:20.560]   The trending hashtag was, shut up, Matt Lauer on Twitter.
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.120]   Is NBC at fault?
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:23.600]   Or is this just the way the Olympics is?
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:24.720]   It's so expensive.
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.560]   NBC spent-- I don't know what they spent--
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:28.040]   must have spent millions and millions of dollars
[00:25:28.040 --> 00:25:29.200]   for the rights to broadcast this.
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.320]   So much about the Olympics is sort of dominated
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:33.120]   by the expanse, like the fact they're
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:35.600]   going around to pubs in the UK and telling them
[00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.960]   they have to be careful about using words like London
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:41.160]   and summer in 2012 on their little chalkboard signs.
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:43.640]   Because it's illegal the IOC will sue you.
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.400]   Because it might tick off the bears that
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.720]   are sponsoring are McDonald's or whoever.
[00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:49.320]   Unbelievable.
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:51.800]   Well, to play kind of devil's advocate--
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:52.320]   Please do.
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:53.760]   I'm waiting for a sensible person.
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:59.120]   As the old media guy, I think NBC
[00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:03.840]   probably should have shown the opening ceremonies when it happened.
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:04.280]   Yes.
[00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:07.960]   And probably should have done the stupid commentator thing,
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:11.880]   the clueless commentator thing, and then repeated it
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:13.000]   for prime time.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   I would have done it the other way.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.600]   I would have said, let's do an unedited--
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.520]   because by the way, they cut parts out
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:19.800]   so they could put more commercials in.
[00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:23.320]   But let's do an unedited live stream without commentary.
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:25.320]   So people, that's a small--
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:26.440]   there's still plenty of people going
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:27.640]   to watch on prime time television.
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:29.240]   They're going to want Matt and Meredith.
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.240]   They're going to want the commercials.
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.600]   Or watch it with just the Twitter stream on the screen.
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:34.240]   Let the Twitter stream--
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.080]   Would that be great?
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:38.040]   Let it be the commentary.
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:43.720]   But the problem is that NBC and other big media companies
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:45.960]   have to serve two constituencies.
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:48.720]   They have to serve the people who have Twitter accounts
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:53.000]   and Facebook accounts and who are kind of active media users.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.920]   And then they also have a huge audience whose--
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:57.640]   there are people who are completely unaware that this
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:01.120]   controversy was going on until it showed up in television news
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:04.440]   stories or in their newspapers or in some other form,
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.400]   the traditional media that they follow.
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:10.840]   And those are the ones who gave NBC huge ratings that evening.
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:13.120]   Oh, I watched because I had to.
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:14.000]   You watched it yet.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.640]   But also, I think the complaints about what
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:19.480]   was happening during the day and people
[00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:23.600]   out of being able to see it drove a bigger audience to NBC.
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.080]   So imagine what would have happened
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.640]   if you had had, say, that live stream and people tweeting
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:28.400]   about it.
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:31.280]   And they told their friends, oh, you'll see this this evening.
[00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:32.760]   And then they had done it.
[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:34.920]   You probably would have had even a bigger audience.
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:37.720]   So NBC hopefully will learn something from this.
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:39.720]   And this is probably the last Olympics
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.040]   where we'll see anything like that.
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:41.680]   That's what I'm thinking.
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.360]   Four years from now.
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:45.920]   Well, here's the other thing is that you might say, well,
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:47.600]   this is media has to do it this way.
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:52.240]   But the BBC is basically doing everything live online
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.200]   without commentary.
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:55.800]   They're doing it all.
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:28:00.320]   It's also happening in real time and in prime time for them.
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.840]   So it's a different time frame, the prime time.
[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:04.040]   And also the structure.
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:04.800]   But that's the point.
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:07.280]   The internet lets you do this live.
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:10.320]   And so people who care that much can watch.
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:12.760]   And everybody who wants to go home after work and watch it
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:14.600]   can do that.
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:15.640]   They don't have to watch live.
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:19.520]   They can watch the Kate and Matt version or whatever it is.
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:22.000]   You can tell that NBC partly gets it
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.520]   because they have made available all of this live stream content.
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.880]   Although there were still moments like there are some things
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:32.880]   that they're not showing and are delaying off of the live stream.
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:36.000]   So they kind of know what they need to do.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.760]   But they're just not quite there yet.
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:40.080]   It's like it's a love affair.
[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:42.040]   And they're not giving it all.
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:46.520]   You don't get anything real in a relationship until you give all.
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:49.840]   And so it's a very unsatisfying relationship right now for NBC
[00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:51.720]   and its online audience.
[00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:54.120]   So wait, are we not just under the impression
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:56.720]   that this was about making sure that they got the ad dollars
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:00.120]   or the worth of the ad dollars for the advertisers?
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:02.360]   I mean, like Apple paid who knows how much for their opening
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:04.560]   ceremonies ads and everybody else paid who knows how much
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:05.640]   for their opening ceremonies ads.
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:08.000]   And if I could have watched it five hours earlier
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.200]   or if I could have watched the non-idiot-proofed feed someplace
[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.760]   else, then I wouldn't have seen the Apple ad.
[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:15.280]   Right?
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:16.440]   I mean, it's true.
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:18.080]   Because also they're going to get everybody
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:20.760]   to watch one thing at one time.
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:22.200]   I mean, the only way to do that, it seems to me,
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:25.680]   is to make sure that they can't watch it in anyplace else.
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:26.640]   Well, then you should say that.
[00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:28.520]   You shouldn't say it's too complex.
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:28.520]   Right.
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:32.120]   You should say, no, sorry, you have to watch the ads.
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:32.480]   Right.
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:33.600]   Yeah, they're not going to say that.
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:36.280]   Robert Scobel said, I'm going to punish them by skipping--
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:39.240]   I'm going to Tivo and punish them by skipping the ads.
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.200]   So here's a question.
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:43.320]   Suppose that they had done two broadcasts.
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:47.640]   Suppose they had done a live daytime when it happened broadcast.
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:48.080]   And then had done--
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:49.280]   How would you do it as a broadcast?
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:50.440]   I'd take advantage of the internet.
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:51.640]   Do it on the internet only.
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:52.880]   Do it on the internet.
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:54.800]   But you still drive--
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:55.520]   Exactly.
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:57.960]   --it's from social media drives people to say,
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:59.000]   you need to see this tonight.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:29:59.500]   Exactly.
[00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:00.600]   If you missed it.
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:02.480]   I think that you would get more viewers.
[00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:03.520]   Right?
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:05.360]   You'd make more money.
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:06.360]   Yep.
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:08.640]   So Gizmodo has a good article, how
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.800]   to watch every second of the Olympics, which
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.640]   tells you how to basically get around the restrictions
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:15.040]   NBC is placing on it.
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:17.400]   But at the beginning, Brent Rose writes, in 1996,
[00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:22.640]   176 and 1/2 hours of the Olympics were broadcast.
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:23.960]   Not the internet, obviously.
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:25.720]   Broadcast in '96.
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:28.800]   This year, between broadcast and internet,
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:34.840]   NBC is going to put 5,535 hours of Olympics online.
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:36.760]   So you've got to give them credit.
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:37.480]   They are doing that.
[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:38.960]   I do give them credit for that.
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:40.120]   I think it's really annoying.
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:43.280]   And I think it's only because Comcast owns NBC
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:44.600]   that they're saying, by the way, you
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:46.880]   have to have a cable or a satellite or--
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.960]   you have to have an account and have to be paying for MSNBC
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:51.000]   or CNBC or you cannot watch online.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.360]   And then so what people are doing
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:54.320]   is what Gizmodo is telling them how to do, which is use
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:56.040]   a proxy and watch it on the BBC.
[00:30:56.040 --> 00:31:00.880]   That seems like a bad--
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:04.080]   it's probably illegal and probably doesn't work so well
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:05.160]   either.
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:07.240]   And there are pirated streams.
[00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:10.640]   Yes, there's a lot of them out there.
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:13.160]   So in four years, this is one thing
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:15.160]   that makes the Olympics and presidential elections,
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:17.000]   by the way, very interesting from an internet point
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.800]   of view, technology point of view, four years is a long time.
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:24.040]   So what do we predict will happen four years hence?
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:26.160]   Well, you've actually got two years for the next Olympics
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:27.640]   because you have to win the Olympics.
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:28.880]   Winter Olympics and Olympics, that's just a bunch of--
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.320]   Oh, are you kidding me?
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:31.320]   No.
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:32.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.080]   Four years ago, streaming.
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:34.840]   Maybe I belong in Buffalo.
[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:36.640]   You belong in Buffalo.
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:37.160]   I may know.
[00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:37.680]   No, I'm just teasing.
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.280]   Of course, the Winter Olympics are.
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:40.960]   But the Summer Olympics, let's just--
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:44.000]   because for argument's sake, because it's four years.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:44.760]   All right.
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:46.320]   You can say, you want to talk about the Winter Olympics
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:47.120]   for two years.
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.120]   That's going to be--
[00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:50.520]   I'm just saying, you've got a smaller window now
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:51.200]   to turn that around.
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:52.720]   You're going to used to be every four years.
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:53.480]   And now it's every two.
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:54.000]   That's right.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.560]   But maybe people don't care as much about hockey.
[00:31:57.560 --> 00:31:58.080]   I do.
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:58.520]   I like hockey.
[00:31:58.520 --> 00:31:59.360]   They should.
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:00.920]   There's actually some great Winter Olympics events.
[00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:02.320]   Skiing is great.
[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:03.640]   There's nothing like curling.
[00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:04.480]   I didn't say it was great.
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:04.840]   I love curling.
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:05.400]   There's nothing like it.
[00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:07.560]   No, I love curling.
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:10.080]   And it's got that great Jonathan Colton soundtrack song, too.
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:11.800]   But you ain't got beach volleyball.
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:14.280]   And I think if you don't have beach volleyball
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:16.440]   you ain't got nothing.
[00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:16.720]   So--
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:17.600]   Snow volleyball.
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:18.680]   Snow volleyball.
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:19.800]   That's what we need.
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:22.120]   NBC says anything that has a camera on it,
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:24.960]   we will at least stream, if not broadcast.
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:26.640]   But I have to think-- well, for instance,
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:30.040]   OK, the opening ceremonies, which were admittedly bizarre,
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:32.600]   but fun to watch, they cut out a whole section
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:36.240]   so that-- what's his name?
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:36.760]   The guy from--
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:38.160]   Ryan Seacrest and Michael Phelps.
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:40.800]   Ryan Seacrest could interview Michael Phelps.
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:44.120]   Like, that's not going to happen later anyway.
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:45.120]   Why would you do that?
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:46.520]   I mean, you're never going to get them
[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:48.360]   to be as honest as you want them to be, though, right?
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:49.800]   I mean, if we assume that the reason they didn't
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:52.400]   put the opening ceremonies any place except in primetime
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:54.320]   is because they wanted the advertisers.
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:58.600]   They said that they didn't show the 7/7 tribute, which
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:32:59.960]   was-- I mean, for people who missed it
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:01.760]   and who haven't heard the stories,
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:03.200]   part of the opening ceremonies were
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:05.520]   a tribute to the people who died in the bomb blast
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:09.040]   on July 7 of 2005.
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:12.440]   Just a few hours after London was announced as the location
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:13.320]   for the 2012 Olympics.
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:15.480]   That's pretty tasteless to cut that.
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.680]   Well, it wasn't geared towards an American audience.
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:18.640]   It's the quote that I heard.
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:20.560]   And of course, it's not geared towards an American audience.
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:21.760]   And how many things do we--
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:24.400]   You think Kenneth Branagh looking like Abe Lincoln
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:27.040]   was geared to the-- any audience at all?
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:29.040]   I kept saying, why is Abe Lincoln?
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:30.040]   Why is Abe Lincoln-- I don't understand
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:31.400]   what Abe Lincoln is doing there.
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:33.320]   And he's holding a book and he's going, smile.
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:35.480]   He's like, yes.
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:36.800]   I don't-- I freed the slate.
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:38.600]   What is he doing there?
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.480]   I think the Olympics arguably would be better off
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.200]   without the opening ceremonies period.
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.200]   I loved them.
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:43.920]   It was catchy.
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:45.120]   It was fun.
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:48.520]   Didn't you love it when they forged rings?
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:49.280]   That was beautiful.
[00:33:49.280 --> 00:33:50.960]   And then they lift them in the air.
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:52.880]   The smokestacks, the glass--
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:55.200]   I thought that this was kind of an interesting--
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:58.720]   Vanity Fair has about the funniest review of these--
[00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:00.240]   if you want to read something about Hootz,
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:03.960]   Vanity Fair online, the funniest review I've ever read
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:06.120]   on these Olympic Olympic ceremonies.
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:08.040]   The part that I liked least was the part that was supposed
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:09.480]   to be dedicated to the digital age.
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:10.920]   But maybe that's just what it looks like, too.
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:11.920]   No, they say.
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:12.960]   It was incomprehensible.
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:14.960]   It's like, wait a minute.
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:18.280]   And by the way, fake Facebook, like, oh, you know, fake--
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:21.880]   that's not Facebook, but it's Facebook-like.
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:25.080]   Vanity Fair of your viewer called it Olympics Facebook.
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:26.800]   And then so they found some--
[00:34:26.800 --> 00:34:27.440]   they're meeting.
[00:34:27.440 --> 00:34:29.600]   And then for some reason, the Beatles march in.
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:30.000]   And then they--
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.720]   And then they tweeted.
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:34.640]   But it was fake Twitter.
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:36.800]   But I think the best part from a tech point of view
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:40.040]   was Tim Berners-Lee sitting in his next cube,
[00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:41.840]   saying this is for everyone.
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:42.480]   I like that.
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:44.040]   Tim Berners-Lee can do no wrong.
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:47.320]   I thought that was a really neat moment.
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:49.880]   All right, going to move along.
[00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:50.600]   Because I'm winey.
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:51.080]   I'm just winey.
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:51.680]   I'm being winey.
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:52.360]   There's no reason.
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:59.520]   But let's just check the Twitter and see what NBC delayed
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:34:59.920]   has.
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:00.760]   Breaking news.
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:02.400]   Michael Jordan, the dream team, when
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:05.720]   gold medaline, victory over Croatia.
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:08.640]   Mark Spitz wins a gold medal in the freestyle.
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:09.800]   It's exciting.
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:12.520]   This is the NBC delayed Twitter feed.
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:17.360]   That's pretty funny.
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.160]   Proof our taped late broadcasting model
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:24.600]   is working over 3,000 new Twitter followers in an hour.
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:26.760]   NBC delayed if you want to follow them.
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:28.360]   Let's make it 20,000 right now.
[00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:34.840]   By the way, and as you pointed out, ratings very, very good.
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:37.000]   So everybody worked.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   Let's talk Mountain Lion.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:42.720]   This week, Apple released OS 10, 10.8,
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:47.080]   which I'm presuming is the ninth version of OS 10, Mountain
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:51.600]   Lion, $20 via the app store, mostly only for Max
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:54.440]   of the last couple of years.
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:56.480]   I'm sure Mac OS can, Ken Ray.
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:59.120]   You were covering this pretty heavily.
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:00.960]   First of all, I guess the first question is,
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:03.720]   have there been any howls of pain?
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:04.640]   I haven't heard any.
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:05.200]   I haven't either.
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:06.920]   I mean, it seems like it actually went very well.
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:09.160]   The biggest complaint anybody had was that it took too long
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:11.360]   to download, but that's because everybody was downloading it.
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:13.240]   Right.
[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:14.120]   That's not bad.
[00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:15.640]   And then who was it?
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:18.360]   Chitika said that Max of Daytrack,
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:22.280]   it's already up to close to 3% of Max online.
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:23.080]   Isn't it amazing?
[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:24.120]   Running Mountain Lion.
[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:24.960]   Well, I mean, it's crazy.
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:27.040]   I'd like to know a little bit more about how many Max
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:28.240]   Daytrack and how they do that.
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:30.240]   But I mean, that they have an appreciable amount
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:32.160]   that they can say within 24 hours.
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:33.920]   Wow, look at that blip.
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.360]   I think most fascinating.
[00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:38.400]   You talk to Mac users all the time on your podcast.
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:41.920]   I would think that you tell me, but I would get most Mac users
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:44.760]   upgrade every time there's a new version.
[00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:46.400]   I mean, it's just kind of a yearly event.
[00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:49.120]   It's only 20 bucks for every machine.
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:50.000]   Well, it's starting to be.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.680]   I mean, honestly, I didn't do it until today
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:52.680]   because I was holding off.
[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:54.360]   I had a couple of things that had to-- well,
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:56.440]   I had a couple of things happen at the end of the week.
[00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:57.720]   And then it was also holding off to make sure
[00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:00.200]   that a couple of productivity apps that I use regularly
[00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:01.240]   were ready.
[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:03.880]   Although there's a great site, RoaringApps.com.
[00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:05.320]   Yeah.
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:07.200]   It's excellent about keeping track of,
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:09.360]   I haven't found an app that I needed to know about
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:11.200]   that they didn't have listed.
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:13.760]   And they show you whether it's working perfectly,
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.200]   kind of working with a couple of Kings
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.920]   and not working at all.
[00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:17.640]   I'll tell you a good thing.
[00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:18.120]   Check out.
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:21.440]   One annoyance that I had, I bought one of them
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:23.240]   written a display, Max.
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:25.200]   So the theory get a free upgrade.
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:26.680]   So there was an Apple up-to-date page.
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:28.200]   As soon as it went live on Wednesday,
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:30.440]   I went there, filled out the form.
[00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:33.360]   Apple did not email me for two days.
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:36.720]   So on Friday, I got my thank you for participating,
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:40.920]   the content code blah, blah, blah, on Friday.
[00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:45.400]   But of course, I couldn't wait three days to download this.
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:47.640]   I paid the 20 bucks.
[00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:51.120]   You would get it with a nanoseconds of fine for it.
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:53.440]   Maybe it's me, but it seems like there's a guy there
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:54.280]   doing the paperwork.
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:56.080]   Well, there was a problem with it all week, right?
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:58.680]   They actually, the up-to-date program went live,
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:01.520]   I'm sorry, the up-to-date program went live on Monday,
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:02.360]   I think it was.
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:03.360]   So people--
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:04.360]   By accident, kind of.
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:05.360]   Right.
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:06.360]   And so people went ahead and sent in,
[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:09.480]   and then when the up-to-date program actually went live,
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:12.000]   the people who had signed up for it at first,
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.480]   I think there was a bit of a delay for them.
[00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:15.080]   And then some people who were getting it were actually
[00:38:15.080 --> 00:38:18.720]   getting the server, a mountain lion server up-to-date
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:21.240]   rather than just the regular mountain lion OS.
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:24.440]   I'm hearing from a lot of people who just got their email.
[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:28.240]   Dan and our chat mod said that he sent a support and email
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:31.480]   saying, "Hey, I had to buy it because I needed it.
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:32.480]   "He's an IT."
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:34.080]   And they gave him a refund.
[00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:36.480]   So I guess I'll have to maybe apply for a refund.
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:38.600]   But is it maybe it's cynical to me, but it seems like it's a
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:40.640]   little convenient that they wait a couple of days.
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:41.640]   Let's just wait a couple--
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:44.000]   Maybe you'll pay for it, let's wait a couple of days.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.160]   Well, to be honest, Leo, I've gotten receipts from buying
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:50.080]   things on iTunes and the App Store two days later.
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:51.280]   No, I'll tell you why that happened.
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:52.280]   So that happened.
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:53.800]   No, there's a reason for that.
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:56.280]   Because it's a credit card charge, and what they want to do
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:58.080]   is aggregate more than one if they can.
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:01.080]   If they did it for every charge, it costs them more.
[00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:02.720]   So they want to get as much together.
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:03.400]   So that's true.
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:04.680]   That's always been the case.
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:07.240]   iTunes receipts will come every few days.
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:10.920]   But when you buy something at the Apple Store as an example,
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:13.320]   you get your receipt before you get home.
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:14.720]   Yeah, or in the stores, I'm talking off your phone.
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:15.560]   And often it's--
[00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:16.720]   Yeah, often instantly.
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:18.000]   So I mean, email is instant.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.120]   I don't understand why it takes a couple of days.
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:23.200]   Well, you mentioned that it's mostly for newer Macs, but I
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:28.040]   was able-- I've got a mid-2007 iMac.
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:29.280]   That's what I'm using right now.
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:31.320]   And I was able to install it without a problem on that.
[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:35.200]   That's the latest-- that's the oldest iMac that will go on.
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:39.080]   And I have a mid-2008 or mid-2009 MacBook Pro.
[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:42.480]   But I had problems installing it on the MacBook Pro.
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:45.840]   When it installed, I kept getting this error message saying
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:49.920]   that the file was corrupted or couldn't be verified
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:52.360]   to redownload it, which I did three times.
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:55.080]   It turns out that for some odd reason,
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:59.360]   it was saving to the disk with incorrect permissions.
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:02.520]   So I had to go in and manually set the permissions on the file
[00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:04.400]   to allow read/write, and then it would work.
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:06.160]   And then it installed fine.
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:09.520]   But I'm using it on a five-year-old Mac, and it's great.
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:10.480]   Awesome.
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:11.760]   Is it faster?
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:15.360]   It's not faster, but it didn't slow it down initially.
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:16.720]   It was running a little slow, but that's
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:20.480]   because the spotlight indexer runs when you first install it.
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:22.240]   But now it's just-- it's like butter.
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:25.920]   It's as good as-- I mean, I've not had a performance hit
[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:29.920]   on this five-year-old Mac with any of these OS X updates.
[00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:34.200]   Each one has just-- it's continued to be very fast.
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:38.320]   For mid-2007, I'm Mac.
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:39.720]   Pretty happy with the update.
[00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:42.720]   The big changes-- and I too have installed
[00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:43.560]   on a number of machines.
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:47.040]   By the way, little pro tip, instead
[00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:49.440]   of downloading the almost 5 gigabyte file
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:52.100]   on every single machine, I just looked at my GOM
[00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:52.600]   guest.
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:56.440]   I'm at 248 of the 250 gigs I'm allowed,
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:58.440]   and I've got another weak left.
[00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:00.160]   So it's a good thing I didn't do this.
[00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:01.720]   I downloaded it on one machine.
[00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:04.380]   You'll get-- don't install it, because it erases the install
[00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:06.640]   file as soon as you've installed it, which I think
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:08.440]   is kind of apples shouldn't be doing that.
[00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:09.920]   I don't know why they're doing that.
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:11.880]   But they do to save space, I guess.
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:14.040]   But before you install it, open up.
[00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:17.360]   You can right-click or Control-click on the file,
[00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:20.040]   the install OS X Mountain Line file,
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:22.460]   and browse through the contents of the package.
[00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:29.260]   And you'll find a file out of 4.7 gig file called installESD.dmg.
[00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:30.420]   That's actually the installer.
[00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:33.020]   You can copy that out, and I did that, put it on USB key.
[00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:35.420]   And then you move around from machine to machine.
[00:41:35.420 --> 00:41:38.880]   And that's the installer so that you can get the installer out
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:42.180]   of there, but you have to do it before you run the install,
[00:41:42.180 --> 00:41:44.860]   because it deletes it at the end of the install.
[00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:47.900]   There's also a very cool Apple script
[00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:52.220]   called Lion Disc Maker that will create--
[00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:55.100]   if you don't delete that-- will create either a USB key
[00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:57.060]   or a DVD installer.
[00:41:57.060 --> 00:42:00.260]   You just run the disk and it extracts everything for it.
[00:42:00.260 --> 00:42:01.380]   You uncreach it.
[00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:03.380]   It's a simple thing if you've used disk utility
[00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:05.060]   to make a bootable USB key.
[00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:06.340]   I just didn't want to waste--
[00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:09.260]   because now it's a 4.7 gig USB key.
[00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:10.860]   I didn't want to waste the space.
[00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:12.900]   I guess you could put other stuff on it later.
[00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:14.780]   But it's going to erase the key.
[00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:16.020]   Anyway, that's handy.
[00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:18.620]   So big differences.
[00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:21.380]   The most notable one is there is now a notification center
[00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:24.100]   over on the right that will tell you--
[00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:27.820]   and it's right now-- it's mostly Apple programs that work
[00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:29.060]   all those Sparrow and Chrome.
[00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:30.580]   Both will do notifications.
[00:42:30.580 --> 00:42:33.180]   I noticed in Chrome you can turn on website notifications,
[00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:34.660]   which is kind of interesting.
[00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:37.980]   You'll get calendar reminders, birthday reminders.
[00:42:37.980 --> 00:42:40.340]   You'll get email notes, that kind of thing.
[00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:43.820]   So this is very much like iOS, the notification center in iOS.
[00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:46.540]   But it's now part of OS 10.
[00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:48.820]   Another big change that's a little bit more under the hood.
[00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:51.180]   But you might notice right away is gatekeeper,
[00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:57.380]   which is a security change to OS 10.
[00:42:57.380 --> 00:42:58.420]   And it's kind of interesting.
[00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:01.660]   What it does is it's in the security and privacy system
[00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:02.380]   preference pane.
[00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:03.380]   Is that where it is?
[00:43:03.380 --> 00:43:03.500]   Yeah.
[00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:07.340]   Under general, it changes the way applications are
[00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:08.540]   installed in OS 10.
[00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:12.020]   I think this isn't a bad idea, but it might bite some people.
[00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:13.540]   There are three different settings.
[00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:16.500]   The most insecure is the one you've been using,
[00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:19.740]   which is you can download and install apps from anywhere.
[00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:23.060]   The new default is you can download and install apps only
[00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:26.460]   from the Mac App Store or developers who
[00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:30.060]   have applied for and received a certificate from Apple,
[00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:32.340]   proving their identity, which is also a good way
[00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:35.740]   to protect you, because bad guys generally don't do that.
[00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:40.020]   And then the highest security setting, which has to be manually
[00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:42.340]   set is Mac App Store only.
[00:43:42.340 --> 00:43:46.380]   If you have kids or relatives who don't understand computers,
[00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:47.820]   that might be a good setting.
[00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:49.180]   But it bit me immediately.
[00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:52.060]   It's funny, because I'm used to downloading apps all the time.
[00:43:52.060 --> 00:43:53.100]   And you download an app.
[00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:55.380]   And then when you try to run it, it says, sorry, you can't run it.
[00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:56.820]   Yeah, I'm going to bite everybody for a while,
[00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:59.300]   because not everybody has the certificates.
[00:43:59.300 --> 00:43:59.620]   Good.
[00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:01.060]   They do tell you, which I like.
[00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:02.340]   Yeah, most developers don't.
[00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:05.540]   They do tell you-- Apple tells you-- when you do try to run an app,
[00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:07.980]   you download it.
[00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:11.700]   All you have to do is right click or control click on the app
[00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:12.540]   and select open.
[00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:15.740]   And it will then open it for one time only,
[00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:17.620]   even if it's a unprotected third party.
[00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:18.860]   I didn't know that, because yeah.
[00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:19.980]   Yeah, and that's handy.
[00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:21.860]   It's because normally what you would do is
[00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:23.060]   say, mama changed that setting.
[00:44:23.060 --> 00:44:24.980]   And you don't really don't want to do that,
[00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:28.500]   I think, normally to produce a security.
[00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:29.500]   Interesting.
[00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:29.900]   Go ahead.
[00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:31.500]   Am I right that this was the first time
[00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:33.380]   that all of the updates are when you check for updates.
[00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:35.740]   It's automatically going through the Mac App Store as well.
[00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:36.100]   Yes.
[00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:36.540]   And that's--
[00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:37.380]   And that's--
[00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:38.180]   Third change.
[00:44:38.180 --> 00:44:39.180]   Big change.
[00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:39.540]   Go ahead.
[00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:40.260]   You tell us.
[00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:40.980]   Now, it's a huge change.
[00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:41.900]   Well, no, that was it.
[00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:43.700]   When I ran it, I was having a little trouble
[00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:46.300]   figuring out whether my computer, which is an early--
[00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:48.980]   I think it's February 2011--
[00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:51.140]   MacBook Pro.
[00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:53.300]   I had heard conflicting reports on whether or not
[00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:56.620]   the AirPlay mirroring was going to work.
[00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:59.060]   And so I went immediately to see if there was an update for that,
[00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:00.700]   because I know there were a couple of updates this week
[00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:03.100]   to make AirPlay mirroring work for a couple of other computers.
[00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:04.180]   And it turns out it actually worked.
[00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:06.300]   It was just I was being an idiot and couldn't figure it out.
[00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:08.380]   But there are a couple of voices that I've downloaded,
[00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:10.500]   and it immediately opened up the Mac App Store.
[00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:11.340]   Isn't that weird?
[00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:13.180]   I was confused, actually.
[00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:14.980]   I thought I accidentally clicked on something else,
[00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:17.860]   and I went back to System Preferences and hit it all again.
[00:45:17.860 --> 00:45:20.180]   And then the second time it showed me the Mac App Store,
[00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:22.540]   I was like, oh, OK, so we're finally going to start doing that.
[00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:23.220]   And it's probably not.
[00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:26.580]   So if you go as Apple users who want to do under the Apple
[00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:29.060]   2 software update, what would normally
[00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:31.220]   launch a System Preference Pay and Call software update
[00:45:31.220 --> 00:45:33.780]   actually launches the App Store?
[00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:36.260]   And you might say, well, no, that's a mistake.
[00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:39.100]   But in fact, now all updates for the system
[00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:40.700]   are coming through the App Store.
[00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:41.740]   Interesting article.
[00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:43.860]   I don't know if you read this from Marco Arment,
[00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:47.060]   the guy who wrote Instapaper.
[00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:51.860]   And he's saying the Mac App Store's future of irrelevance.
[00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:54.660]   He's pointing out that Postbox, which
[00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:57.660]   is a fairly well-known mail application,
[00:45:57.660 --> 00:46:00.100]   has pulled out of the Mac App Store.
[00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:02.940]   And he says a lot of developers are pulling out
[00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:07.260]   because of things like there's no paid upgrades.
[00:46:07.260 --> 00:46:09.540]   Sandboxing is required.
[00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:11.940]   So in order to be compatible with sandboxing,
[00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:14.500]   you may have to remove some features.
[00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:16.500]   There's no demo versions available.
[00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:20.580]   It's just some significant restrictions in the App Store
[00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:24.140]   that developers are increasingly upset with.
[00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:26.460]   And this is what I thought was interesting.
[00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:29.580]   Marco points out, as many of us who use the Mac App Store
[00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:33.620]   and use Macs have always said, which is the Mac App Store
[00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:36.180]   is so great, I'm actually buying apps a second time
[00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:38.180]   unnecessarily just because I want the updates,
[00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:39.260]   because of the convenience, because I
[00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:40.540]   can install all my machines.
[00:46:40.540 --> 00:46:42.020]   He says, in the first year of Mac App Store,
[00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:45.140]   before sandboxing, I bought as much as I could from it.
[00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:47.140]   As a customer, the convenience was so great.
[00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:50.460]   I even repurchased a few apps I already owned.
[00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:54.060]   But now I've lost all confidence that the apps I buy
[00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:57.220]   in the App Store today will still be there next month
[00:46:57.220 --> 00:46:57.980]   or next year.
[00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:02.020]   The advantages of buying from the App Store are mostly gone now.
[00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:04.020]   He's concerned, I think, as others
[00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:07.180]   are, that the App Store, by being so restrictive,
[00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:11.980]   is going to end up not being the go-to place for Mac apps.
[00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:14.580]   There is some stuff that works fine on iOS, which
[00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:16.340]   is more of a challenge on the Mac.
[00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:19.580]   For instance, issues with demo apps on iOS
[00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:21.940]   are not as big a deal because if something is 99 cents--
[00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:22.820]   Big deal, right.
[00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:25.980]   Just buy it, and add no tragedy if you don't like it.
[00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:27.620]   And Mac apps are not like that.
[00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:29.620]   They still cost quite a bit more.
[00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:31.980]   And you're probably going to be much more interested in trying
[00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:33.700]   them before you buy them.
[00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:35.900]   I'm very curious also what this means for Windows 8,
[00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:39.180]   because at least with the Mac, you have a choice between the
[00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:42.020]   Mac App Store and buying stuff the old way.
[00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:45.740]   And Microsoft is saying that for Windows 8 Metro apps,
[00:47:45.740 --> 00:47:47.860]   you'll only go through the Windows Store.
[00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:50.620]   And so you're really hosed if that doesn't do what developers
[00:47:50.620 --> 00:47:51.100]   need.
[00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:54.340]   That means if you're buying on the Windows RT, their tablet,
[00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:55.900]   you'll be buying through an App Store only.
[00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:57.380]   But that's kind of like iOS.
[00:47:57.380 --> 00:47:58.220]   Yeah, it is.
[00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:00.340]   On the desktop, you still have desktop apps, right?
[00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:02.660]   We can buy old desktop apps the old way.
[00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:05.860]   And to be fair, I think Microsoft is attempting to learn
[00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:07.220]   from some of Apple's mistakes.
[00:48:07.220 --> 00:48:09.980]   And they have exactly the same rules.
[00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:13.580]   There's an advantage to being a little behind you can watch
[00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:16.060]   where the arrows are in the guy ahead of you's back.
[00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:17.860]   And you avoid those--
[00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:20.820]   I kind of thought all along that I'm sorry, Apple would more
[00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:23.140]   quickly add more of these features developers want to make
[00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:25.540]   it easier to sell stuff.
[00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:26.780]   And for the most part, they have it.
[00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:28.700]   I don't know whether that's because they don't want to
[00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:32.100]   or that it's just not all that high on their priority list.
[00:48:32.100 --> 00:48:34.700]   Go ahead, Ken.
[00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:36.900]   I'm just wondering--
[00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:39.060]   I mean, it's an interesting thing what Marco was saying.
[00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:41.060]   And unfortunately, I haven't read the article.
[00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:42.140]   Yes, not on a rundown.
[00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:42.580]   I'm sorry.
[00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:43.180]   I just--
[00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:44.180]   That's right.
[00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:45.780]   From what you're telling me, though, I mean,
[00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:48.420]   it seems like there are two--
[00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:51.100]   I mean, people complain about things like the Mac App Store
[00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:52.500]   or the iOS App Store.
[00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:54.740]   People used to complain about the iOS App Store
[00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:56.660]   about how curated everything was.
[00:48:56.660 --> 00:48:59.060]   But I think we've sort of gotten on board on iOS
[00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:01.980]   that that's really just for the general consumer.
[00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:03.980]   And so we're kind of OK with some of the restrictions there
[00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:05.220]   or we've gotten used to it.
[00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:07.220]   Right.
[00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:09.500]   It's the whole car truck thing that Jobs talked about.
[00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:13.020]   I mean, are we trying to kid-proof?
[00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:14.020]   And I don't mean kid-proof.
[00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:16.540]   But I mean, are we trying to kid-proof the computer operating
[00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:18.580]   experience as well for all the people who are coming in
[00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:19.340]   for the first time?
[00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:20.820]   Stupid proof it.
[00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:22.660]   And stupid proof it, yeah.
[00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:24.180]   Well, isn't that where we're moving?
[00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:26.060]   I mean, one of the things about Mountain Line
[00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:27.900]   is more and more like iOS.
[00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:30.500]   Windows A is a perfect example, more and more
[00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:32.260]   like a tablet OS.
[00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:33.820]   I think we are moving in that direction.
[00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:37.820]   And unfortunately, those of us here and those people
[00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:40.540]   who watch the show are exactly the--
[00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:43.980]   these are the ones that want power
[00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:48.060]   and are willing to sacrifice ease of use for power.
[00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:50.340]   I think Apple sort of got it right with Mountain Line.
[00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:51.300]   You can do--
[00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:51.940]   You get a choice.
[00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:53.540]   --just middle road.
[00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:56.780]   Or you can go the old way and do whatever you want.
[00:49:56.780 --> 00:49:58.420]   Or you can go super conservative.
[00:49:58.420 --> 00:50:02.020]   And the default is not super conservative in the middle one.
[00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:04.180]   That's most Apple's centric.
[00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:06.300]   It's in the middle.
[00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:08.940]   As long as that's not a step towards a more restrictive
[00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:11.420]   future, I think it's just fine.
[00:50:11.420 --> 00:50:13.620]   It's almost like it's a setting for the people who actually
[00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:15.780]   would be fine with an iPad, but don't realize yet
[00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:16.980]   that they would be fine with an iPad.
[00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:18.300]   So they're still buying a computer,
[00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:20.380]   but it's going to go ahead and funnel them to a place
[00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:22.100]   where they're not going to be able to screw themselves
[00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:23.420]   or their computer out.
[00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:28.140]   I think with Windows 8, Microsoft already
[00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:31.660]   is taking so many risks from the interface
[00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:34.700]   to the approach to the way it works
[00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:36.900]   and the way documents work on it,
[00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:40.060]   that to say that we're only going to allow you
[00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:45.020]   to get these Metro apps through our store
[00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:47.700]   may keep developers from developing Metro apps.
[00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:50.940]   Or they'll develop apps for both sides,
[00:50:50.940 --> 00:50:53.780]   and you'll be able to do much more
[00:50:53.780 --> 00:50:56.940]   with the traditional Windows style apps,
[00:50:56.940 --> 00:50:59.900]   and those will continue to be much more favorable
[00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:01.140]   to consumers.
[00:51:01.140 --> 00:51:05.540]   I think Microsoft, I think, has a lot more to lose
[00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:09.420]   with the way it's doing its model than the way Apple is.
[00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:12.060]   >> Yeah, I mean, because think about the way
[00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:14.260]   the iOS app store started, right?
[00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:15.900]   We had a year without it.
[00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:17.660]   And certainly there were jail breaks,
[00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:19.300]   and there were apps that people could install that way,
[00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:21.820]   but we had a year of sort of chomping at the bit
[00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:22.820]   and saying, "Well, this is a great thing,
[00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:24.020]   "but I wish it could do more."
[00:51:24.020 --> 00:51:26.460]   So then when they opened up their app store,
[00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:27.900]   there wasn't like the, "Yeah, but I want to be able
[00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:29.660]   "to get the apps someplace else from most people."
[00:51:29.660 --> 00:51:31.900]   Most people were like, "Hey, look, super monkey funball."
[00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:33.820]   Or whatever, one of the first--
[00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:35.460]   >> That was the first one, you're right.
[00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:37.300]   >> Right, yeah, I can't remember what it was called.
[00:51:37.300 --> 00:51:38.260]   That's what I always call it.
[00:51:38.260 --> 00:51:41.340]   But, so Microsoft's looking at that and saying,
[00:51:41.340 --> 00:51:42.500]   "Well, that's what Apple did,
[00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:43.700]   "but it's not exactly what Apple did.
[00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:44.980]   "What Apple did was gave you something
[00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:47.460]   "that basically had 12 things that it could do
[00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:48.700]   "and it did them really beautifully,
[00:51:48.700 --> 00:51:50.660]   "and then you really couldn't do anything else with it."
[00:51:50.660 --> 00:51:52.380]   And so then when they opened up their app store,
[00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:53.820]   people weren't grossing about not being able
[00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:56.260]   to get stuff on any place else, for the most part.
[00:51:56.260 --> 00:51:57.740]   People were saying, "Look at all the new stuff
[00:51:57.740 --> 00:51:59.100]   "that I can do."
[00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:01.620]   And so for Microsoft to start with that, you're right.
[00:52:01.620 --> 00:52:02.860]   I mean, that does seem like they're just
[00:52:02.860 --> 00:52:05.780]   sort of putting themselves behind the eight ball.
[00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:06.980]   Or between a rock and a hard place,
[00:52:06.980 --> 00:52:09.060]   or between the sila and karibdis, take your pick.
[00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:11.660]   >> Oh, sila and karibdis, wow.
[00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:12.500]   >> Thank you.
[00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:13.620]   >> Wow, that's the police, too.
[00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:15.100]   >> Time is the mast.
[00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:17.740]   So, I guess this is gonna be fun.
[00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:19.380]   I mean, tech journalists love this
[00:52:19.380 --> 00:52:22.020]   because we're gonna have a very fun time this fall.
[00:52:22.020 --> 00:52:25.820]   Microsoft, I think, slipped the date for Windows 8.
[00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:26.660]   Did they not?
[00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:27.820]   >> October 26.
[00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:30.060]   >> October 26, so we know when it'll come out.
[00:52:30.060 --> 00:52:32.060]   >> And I guess the main surface will come out then as well.
[00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:34.700]   >> Right, 'cause they said when general availability
[00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:39.460]   of Windows 8, that's when Surface Pro.
[00:52:39.460 --> 00:52:41.100]   No, our Windows RT.
[00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:43.100]   >> Oh no, Surface for Windows RT.
[00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:45.060]   >> And then three months later Pro will come out,
[00:52:45.060 --> 00:52:46.560]   which is a Windows 8 tablet.
[00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:49.240]   Why so long?
[00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:50.080]   Because you know, they're red,
[00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:52.320]   almost the final bits, supposedly,
[00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:55.120]   they're ready to manufacture RTM version of Windows 8
[00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:56.320]   is like days away.
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:57.480]   >> Yeah, it always takes a while.
[00:52:57.480 --> 00:52:58.320]   And I guess--
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:00.040]   >> Well, I understood when they had to print CDs,
[00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:01.440]   but they're not doing that anymore.
[00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:03.720]   >> I think Toshiba and Dell and Lenovo and everybody,
[00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:05.560]   so I need to just interrupt their machines.
[00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:08.600]   And they're all working on machines,
[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:10.840]   which haven't even been announced yet for Windows 8.
[00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:11.920]   And they need to make sure they work.
[00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:13.640]   And remember, with Windows Vista,
[00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:16.960]   one of the main reasons the experience was so bad
[00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:20.200]   with Vista, out of the gate, was that the companies
[00:53:20.200 --> 00:53:21.640]   that make the hardware did not have enough time
[00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:23.400]   to check their drivers.
[00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:26.360]   And so they had a miserable experience based on that.
[00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:28.400]   So I think having a window for verifying
[00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:30.440]   the stuff works is actually smart.
[00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:35.440]   >> You write, do I in your tech blog about Microsoft
[00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:38.760]   finally kind of acknowledging that the Surface
[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:41.640]   is gonna piss off the OEMs?
[00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:45.280]   >> Yeah, when journalists have asked the executives
[00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:50.280]   of Microsoft exactly how their hardware partners
[00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:53.240]   are reacting to it, they kind of smile at way.
[00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:54.680]   >> Oh, they find a problem.
[00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:55.520]   No problems.
[00:53:55.520 --> 00:53:59.240]   >> But in their SEC documents, they said under,
[00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:02.520]   the first item under the risks for this quarter
[00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:05.920]   are that the OEMs may not be very pleased
[00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:08.480]   that they're doing this and could cause disruption
[00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:10.560]   in the relationship with the partners.
[00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:14.680]   And certainly there were some, I believe Acer
[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:16.560]   was not happy and publicly stated.
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:19.920]   So and Microsoft didn't even tell its partners
[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:22.800]   it was doing this until a day or two before
[00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:24.480]   the announcement of the Surface.
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:26.000]   And there was reason for that.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:29.800]   They didn't want these guys complaining before the event.
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:34.360]   And I think that, again, there were all these huge risks
[00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:36.520]   that Microsoft is taking with Windows 8.
[00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:38.000]   And this is just one of them.
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:42.640]   Gabe Newell, who is with, who's the CEO and co-founder
[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:44.520]   of Valve, who used to work at Microsoft,
[00:54:44.520 --> 00:54:46.640]   thinks Windows 8 is gonna be a catastrophe
[00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:49.160]   for the Windows ecosystem.
[00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:53.280]   And he's trying to double down on Linux as a--
[00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:54.880]   >> Oh, yeah, come on, really?
[00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:56.160]   >> Yeah, right, right.
[00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:58.920]   It's the year of the Linux desktop.
[00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:02.840]   >> It is the year of the Linux desktop, finally!
[00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:05.720]   >> Well, this is kind of an amazing thing we're talking about.
[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:06.920]   I'm sorry, forgive me.
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:08.720]   Go ahead, go ahead, Ken.
[00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:10.000]   >> Well, no, it was just a joke.
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:11.840]   I'm sorry, we're talking about the possibility
[00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:13.600]   of a tech bubble returning, and we're talking about
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:15.400]   the year of the Linux desktop.
[00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:17.720]   It's like somebody has set the way back
[00:55:17.720 --> 00:55:20.080]   when she's on all of it, that's not telling.
[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:22.600]   >> Who else somebody else went along with Gabe Newell?
[00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:25.920]   Some other game guy said, yeah, Windows 8 doesn't look good.
[00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:27.520]   We're not thrilled about it either.
[00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:29.640]   >> I can't.
[00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:33.160]   >> And on the desktops, on the traditional Windows desktop side,
[00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:36.840]   and I've seen some white papers and some discussion
[00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:40.080]   of this, the drivers on that side are actually fair.
[00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:43.000]   Yeah, they're nicer, and there's the new version
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.680]   of DirectX, which gives new capabilities.
[00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:48.240]   So I think for that side, it's fine.
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:51.960]   I think that probably the Metro area,
[00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:53.760]   except maybe for casual gaming,
[00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:57.040]   will get completely ignored by the game community.
[00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:57.880]   >> That's...
[00:55:57.880 --> 00:56:00.920]   >> And I also think that Windows 7 is gonna be around
[00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:03.840]   as long as Windows XP was as a result of this.
[00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:05.240]   I think Windows 7...
[00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:06.160]   >> Oh, absolutely.
[00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:07.200]   >> That's the new XP.
[00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:08.200]   >> Absolutely.
[00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:09.960]   Rob Pardo at Blizzard.
[00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:12.200]   >> Thanks, Sichito, on our chatroom.
[00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:13.360]   I've got his tweet here.
[00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:15.320]   Nice interview with Gabe Newell.
[00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:17.680]   He says he concurs, basically.
[00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:19.520]   It's not awesome for Blizzard either.
[00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:23.400]   By the way, this is the new way of communicating
[00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:26.800]   with press and users.
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:27.640]   Tweet it.
[00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:29.520]   >> Absolutely.
[00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:32.800]   >> Yeah, not awesome for Blizzard either, says Rob Pardo.
[00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:33.640]   Why not?
[00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:35.360]   I mean, you said it's got a new DirectX.
[00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:37.760]   Those games will be easier to install, easier to use.
[00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:38.680]   Don't they do well on...
[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:41.000]   Well, Blizzard never been a console game company,
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:41.840]   but don't...
[00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:44.880]   That's one of the reasons people buy Xboxes,
[00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:46.080]   'cause it's so easy.
[00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:48.400]   Won't this just be like that?
[00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:50.200]   It'll just...
[00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:51.040]   >> Well, there is a...
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:51.880]   >> There is...
[00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:54.440]   One interesting thing is there is a lot of integration
[00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:58.720]   with the Xbox ecosystem in Windows 8.
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:56:59.560]   >> Right.
[00:56:59.560 --> 00:57:03.840]   >> So there may be some of that.
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:06.680]   The Kubi Microsoft is really wanting to push people
[00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:11.760]   towards the Xbox as their primary gaming platform.
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:15.920]   There has long been this mantra of PC gaming is dead.
[00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:18.760]   I don't know that I agree with that, but certainly that...
[00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:19.600]   >> Oh, no.
[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:22.040]   In fact, it's never been more alive if you ask me.
[00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:23.240]   >> Right, right, right.
[00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:26.360]   And so, I'm not quite sure what it is they're talking about
[00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:30.480]   other than perhaps the notion that there is a lot of...
[00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:33.280]   People are not going to want to go anywhere near Windows 8
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:35.320]   just because of the changes in it.
[00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:38.120]   And so they're going to end up being stuck
[00:57:38.120 --> 00:57:41.320]   with Windows 7 technologies for a while
[00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:44.840]   just as they still have to accommodate Windows XP technologies.
[00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:46.320]   >> Who was it we were talking to now?
[00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:47.160]   I can't remember.
[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:50.400]   Oh, it was Nolan Bushnell, founder of Atari,
[00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:53.560]   who said, "Because consoles have not been updated,
[00:57:53.560 --> 00:57:55.520]   "they're getting very long in the tooth.
[00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:57.200]   "I know we're going to get a new Xbox next year."
[00:57:57.200 --> 00:57:59.440]   But he said, "He believes that console gaming
[00:57:59.440 --> 00:58:00.720]   "has been stalled in the water.
[00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:02.520]   "You haven't seen much improvement.
[00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:04.960]   "It's just, you know, Call of Duty 23."
[00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:09.960]   And that PC gaming is where all of the innovation is happening.
[00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:12.840]   >> An awful lot has changed since those consoles came out.
[00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:13.680]   >> Yeah.
[00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:14.520]   >> It's a different era.
[00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:15.360]   >> Yeah.
[00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:16.200]   >> You can't...
[00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:17.040]   >> I don't know.
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:17.880]   >> So, he was telling me, I didn't realize this,
[00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:19.280]   you can't even multitask on the Xbox.
[00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:21.600]   You can only, even though it's got three PC power...
[00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:26.600]   Power PC processors, it will only do one thing at a time.
[00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:30.400]   >> Okay, I have two questions based on what you guys
[00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:31.240]   were just talking about.
[00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:36.240]   First of all, is the surface possibly the Windows RT version,
[00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:39.160]   the one that's coming out at the end of October?
[00:58:39.160 --> 00:58:40.800]   If it comes out at a low enough cost,
[00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:42.200]   I mean, is that sort of like a,
[00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:43.240]   I don't want to say a gateway drug,
[00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:45.480]   but I mean, does that maybe calm people down a little bit?
[00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:47.240]   If they're able to get that in their hands and see...
[00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:48.160]   >> Prices everything.
[00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:51.160]   We saw a fake blog post from Sweden saying
[00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:54.320]   it was going to be $1,000 and everybody flipped their lids
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:56.120]   and it turns out that was just a dummy price
[00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:59.400]   that nobody really meant to be a public.
[00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:00.720]   It's got to be...
[00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:02.480]   >> The iPad or less, right?
[00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:03.760]   >> More or less, the...
[00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:05.960]   >> Even the iPad can't be the iPad anymore
[00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:09.360]   with a $200 Nexus 7, you better be a few hundred bucks.
[00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:10.720]   >> And the starting price for the iPad
[00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:13.800]   might be by time October 26 rolls around,
[00:59:13.800 --> 00:59:15.400]   there might be a $200 iPad.
[00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:19.320]   >> I would hate to be in this market to be honest.
[00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:23.040]   I mean, you're just getting crushed on the margins, aren't you?
[00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:25.000]   >> I mean, basically with Windows 8 in general,
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.960]   I think we are going to have no clue this year,
[00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:29.600]   whether it's a good idea for Microsoft
[00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:30.920]   or the world in general.
[00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:32.360]   You might not even know next year,
[00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:33.960]   it really is sort of trying to build a Windows
[00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:35.760]   for the next five to 10 years.
[00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:38.960]   It's going to take a while before it's clear what's going on.
[00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:41.280]   >> I want to take a little break where you are talking
[00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:44.800]   about Windows 8, we got a new iPhone picture.
[00:59:44.800 --> 00:59:45.960]   I don't know if it's true or not,
[00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:48.720]   but we'll take a look at it and a lot more to go,
[00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:50.960]   but Dwight Silverman's here from the Houston Chronicle,
[00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:54.200]   Harry McCrackett from Time Magazine and the Technologizer.
[00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:57.280]   Mac OS Ken Ken Ray from Mac OS Ken.com,
[00:59:57.280 --> 01:00:00.920]   we're talking about tech, but first before we go any further,
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:04.680]   let's see Tom Merritt is in our TNT newsroom.
[01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:06.720]   What's coming up in the week ahead, Tom?
[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:08.280]   >> Hey, thanks Leo, here's a look at some of the things
[01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:09.920]   we'll be keeping an eye on in the week ahead,
[01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:12.920]   Monday, July 30th at that Apple Samsung
[01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:14.840]   mother of all patent trials kicks off
[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:16.720]   in US federal court in San Jose.
[01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:20.600]   Tuesday, July 31st is the last day for iWork.com.
[01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:23.560]   If you're interested, it's going away that day.
[01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:25.640]   Wednesday, August 1st, we get earnings from Yelp,
[01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:27.960]   Thursday, August 2nd, earnings from LinkedIn,
[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:31.200]   and Friday, August 3rd, Dragon Naturally Speaking 12,
[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:33.600]   comes out for $100, and the CrunchUp
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:36.400]   and August Capital Party 2012 happens.
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:38.400]   All that and more coming up this week on Tech News today.
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:39.840]   Back to you Leo.
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:41.560]   >> Previously on Twitch.
[01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:42.560]   >> Uh-oh.
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:44.120]   (dramatic music)
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:45.720]   (laughs)
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:46.760]   Nice.
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:48.200]   >> Security now.
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:50.920]   Secure against rubber hose.
[01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:52.160]   >> Oh dear.
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:56.040]   >> Mac Break Weekly, coming from Boston, Greece,
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:57.280]   and Northern California.
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:58.960]   Stand by, here comes a link.
[01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:02.240]   Fire up Chirp because here's our link of the week.
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:04.480]   (beeping)
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:05.640]   Gizwiz.
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:06.640]   >> All right, so we're going to set the bar.
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:07.480]   >> I think we have one left over.
[01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:08.320]   >> I think we have one left over.
[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:09.760]   >> That's the bar.
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:11.400]   >> That bar is set.
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:12.240]   >> Jump over it.
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:15.040]   >> Let's, okay, I think you can jump over the bar.
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:16.520]   (laughs)
[01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:18.440]   >> This week in Enterprise Tech.
[01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:20.520]   >> There we, there we, quiet.
[01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:22.640]   I'm hunting Wi-Fi always.
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:24.040]   (laughs)
[01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:26.320]   >> Welcome to I5 for the iPhone.
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:29.720]   This is the show for us, the iPhone fans.
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:31.280]   >> Windows Weekly.
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:33.360]   There's a new lobbying group in town.
[01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:35.200]   (laughs)
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:38.360]   And this time, he means business.
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:41.560]   Charles Bronson is the lobbyist.
[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:42.400]   >> The lobbyist.
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:43.560]   (laughs)
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:44.680]   >> Before you buy.
[01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:47.280]   >> If Google comes around and adds more capability
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:49.640]   to the Nexus Q, I'd revisit my statement.
[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:51.800]   But at this point, I cannot recommend
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:53.520]   that you buy the Nexus Q.
[01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:55.840]   >> The problem is, is nobody's going to buy two
[01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:57.160]   because nobody's going to buy one.
[01:01:57.160 --> 01:01:59.400]   However, I bet you you'll be able to buy them
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:01.480]   for 20 bucks on eBay in about three months.
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:02.960]   >> This week in Tech.
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:05.760]   >> And you know, I think your staff quit the other day,
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:06.920]   the whole company.
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:08.640]   (laughs)
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:09.640]   >> That was disgusting.
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:12.160]   >> If you missed this week on Twitch,
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:14.160]   you missed a lot.
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:16.360]   >> We're still cleaning up the table after that spit tick.
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:17.880]   It's a little, if you find a little moisture there,
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:18.880]   that's just,
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:20.880]   (sings)
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:25.960]   By the way, TNT Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. Pacific.
[01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:28.400]   It's a new time, 10 a.m. Pacific,
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:30.760]   1 p.m. Eastern time,
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:35.760]   1,700 UTC Monday through Friday on Twitch.tv.
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:42.000]   I don't even, I don't even know if it's worth mentioning.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.400]   I guess I will.
[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:47.280]   New pictures, 9 to 5 Mac,
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:49.880]   has new pictures of the new iPhone.
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:51.640]   Now, I believe,
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:54.520]   can, again, I'm going to defer to you as a Mac expert,
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:57.360]   that it's not unusual for Apple to have multiple prototypes,
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:58.840]   maybe not at this stage.
[01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:01.800]   This clearly is something,
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:06.040]   but is it the next iPhone or a next iPhone?
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:07.440]   >> I pass.
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:08.880]   (laughs)
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:09.720]   >> Can I do that?
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:10.800]   >> Yeah. >> It was interesting to see
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:13.880]   in the Samsung Apple documents that came out earlier,
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:16.240]   this week they said some of the things
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:20.280]   they showed were two-tone prototype of the iPhone
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:21.440]   before we had an iPhone.
[01:03:21.440 --> 01:03:22.280]   >> Right.
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:25.720]   >> And did you see the original iPad from like eight years ago?
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:26.560]   >> I didn't see that, yeah.
[01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:27.800]   >> That was wonderful.
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:29.280]   >> That was the one without the kickstand, right?
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:30.120]   >> Yeah.
[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:31.040]   >> Oh yeah, that was another story.
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:32.560]   Was that a patent application,
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:36.160]   or there was an actual prototype of an iPad with a kickstand?
[01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:38.360]   >> That was a little lawsuit document.
[01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:40.320]   >> That's from the Elsa from the lawsuit document.
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:41.160]   >> Oh.
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:43.120]   >> Right, so I don't know.
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:45.880]   I mean, I got on board with the whole larger screen thing.
[01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:48.040]   They're like longer, skinnier iPhone,
[01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:49.680]   and then I kinda got on board with the e-wool,
[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:50.720]   it's gonna have the metal back,
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:52.120]   and then I got on board with the two-tone.
[01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:55.160]   So here's, I mean, I think we're fairly certain
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:56.480]   there's gonna be a new iPhone.
[01:03:56.480 --> 01:03:59.200]   >> That's about all we know, come on, let's admit it.
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:00.680]   >> And then I'm cool after that.
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:02.280]   I mean, you know, obviously when they talk about
[01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:05.560]   the product transition, and they're trying not to say
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:06.680]   that it's gonna be a new iPhone,
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:08.600]   but then they're perfectly willing to talk about all the talk
[01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:11.800]   about a new iPhone is killing sales for this quarter.
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:16.320]   Although I read a really interesting piece, Walter Pye-Check.
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:19.080]   And this is actually sort of born up in the AT&T stuff.
[01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:21.240]   Walter Pye-Check said, yeah, the problem isn't
[01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:22.720]   that people are waiting for the next iPhone.
[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:24.560]   The problem is AT&T and Verizon and everybody
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:26.640]   have linked in their upgrade cycles.
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:29.280]   He said, in one of his notes, and I can't remember
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:31.840]   where it was, might've been business insider,
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:35.120]   he said in the note that he sent to investors
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:37.440]   or to clients or to whoever he sent notes to.
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:39.880]   His mom, his fifth grade girlfriend maybe.
[01:04:39.880 --> 01:04:42.960]   He said in the notes that he sent that he thinks that
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:45.320]   AT&T probably would've sold just as many iPhones.
[01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:49.000]   They would've actually beaten sequentially
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.840]   if they hadn't linked in the upgrade cycle.
[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:53.120]   And he's probably, I mean, maybe he's right.
[01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:54.800]   And AT&T doesn't care.
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:57.360]   AT&T actually said in their earnings notes
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:05:00.360]   that yes, part of the way that they were able to keep
[01:05:00.360 --> 01:05:03.080]   calls down was by lengthening the amount of time
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:05.200]   that people have to wait for another iPhone.
[01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:07.920]   So I'm sorry, I just went like four different places
[01:05:07.920 --> 01:05:08.760]   there, Apple.
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:09.600]   - No, I think it's interesting.
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:12.160]   And in fact, you know, Samsung, both Apple and Samsung
[01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:15.880]   had their quarterly earnings calls this week.
[01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:20.880]   Apple sold 26 million iPhones in the quarter past.
[01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:23.280]   Samsung almost doubled that.
[01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:26.200]   And now that's including a variety of phones,
[01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:29.480]   not just the Galaxy S3, but I wonder if,
[01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:32.760]   I know all the analysts, everybody's saying the iPhone 5
[01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:34.960]   or whatever they call it's gonna be the next big thing.
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:36.160]   It's gonna be huge.
[01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:38.480]   It's gonna sell better than any iPhone previous.
[01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:40.040]   There's pent up demand.
[01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:41.960]   People have been waiting for years for this.
[01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:44.640]   The fact that Apple had to say we took, you know,
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:46.680]   less of a, we took a little hit this quarter
[01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:48.160]   because we didn't sell as many
[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:51.240]   because everybody knows there's a new one coming.
[01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:53.800]   I think despite all that, I think it's a more competitive
[01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:56.240]   environment than it has been in the past.
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:59.520]   And I just think that Apple is not an automatic.
[01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:01.480]   Maybe it is, is it?
[01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:04.200]   - It is more competitive, but the competition is between
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:05.720]   Apple and Samsung.
[01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:08.320]   Basically everybody else is not doing that hot.
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:10.320]   - There are HTC's barely surviving.
[01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:13.840]   - Obviously the Galaxy line is the other sort of signature,
[01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:15.920]   well known big brand of phone.
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:17.440]   - 'Cause it looks just like an iPhone.
[01:06:17.440 --> 01:06:18.560]   - Oh, the new one doesn't so much.
[01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:20.280]   - No, I mean, well I don't know.
[01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:23.240]   - It looks like what they think the next iPhone
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:24.240]   might look like.
[01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:25.080]   - Oh, see?
[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:26.400]   - Are you carrying that?
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:28.960]   Is that your daily driver, Dwight?
[01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:31.280]   - At the moment, I'm using this a lot.
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:32.840]   And I'm a big iPhone fan.
[01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:34.320]   I really like it.
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:36.680]   And I've had one since the 3G,
[01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:40.080]   but this is a sweet, sweet smartphone.
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:40.920]   - I have a great background.
[01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:41.760]   - It's very nice.
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:43.400]   - And I could see myself carrying one of these.
[01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:46.600]   And I'm gonna be looking as a consumer,
[01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:50.040]   I'm gonna be looking really carefully at what Apple does.
[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:52.400]   It's gotta be at least this nice in order for me to--
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:53.240]   - I agree.
[01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:54.640]   - And you wanna jump.
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:57.000]   - Apple's running some risks because they're apparently
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.400]   changing the connector if these pictures are to be believed.
[01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:00.840]   We've talked about this before.
[01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:04.080]   - And supposedly they will include a, or they'll offer
[01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:06.240]   an adapter that better be in the box,
[01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:07.560]   I think, on the first one.
[01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:09.960]   - And it better fit so seamlessly and nicely
[01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:12.480]   that I can continue to use all of those docks that I have
[01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:13.560]   'cause I've got it down to them.
[01:07:13.560 --> 01:07:14.400]   - Yes, yes.
[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:18.840]   But you know, if, indeed, the next iPhone looks like that
[01:07:18.840 --> 01:07:23.200]   prototype that you showed, that's boring.
[01:07:23.200 --> 01:07:24.040]   - It is.
[01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:25.080]   - Yes, that's boring.
[01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:26.560]   That's not what I wanna see from Apple.
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:29.840]   I wanna see something really new and different and exciting.
[01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:33.160]   And it's at least this thin, you know?
[01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:36.240]   And at least with a screen that's at least as nice as that.
[01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:38.160]   It only has to be that big 'cause there's a problem
[01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:41.600]   with big screens and your thumb, you know?
[01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:44.120]   But it needs to be bigger than what it is
[01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:45.480]   and it needs to be nicer than what.
[01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:47.240]   - Apple might have lost its mojo, what do you say?
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:49.240]   - Well, what it needs more than anything else is LTE.
[01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:50.080]   I mean--
[01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:51.800]   - Yeah, they're really behind in that regard.
[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:53.000]   - If you have an iPhone with LTE,
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.480]   that's kind of all the excitement I want.
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:56.480]   That'll be such a big improvement as long as they can
[01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:58.080]   keep the battery life good.
[01:07:58.080 --> 01:08:02.160]   - Is LTE penetration for AT&T Verizon and Sprint sufficient?
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:04.920]   Well, not for Sprint so much, but for those two sufficient
[01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:06.720]   to drive enough sales?
[01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:08.000]   - Well, for Verizon, definitely.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.200]   - Yeah, 'cause I don't have LTE here.
[01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:12.400]   - AT&T is still catching up.
[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:14.040]   But you don't wanna buy a new phone.
[01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:15.640]   - Yeah, you're not gonna buy it for a G-cell.
[01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:16.480]   - Yeah, you're right.
[01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:17.840]   - And so I think the big challenge for Apple
[01:08:17.840 --> 01:08:21.280]   is everybody else is willing to ship an LTE phone
[01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:23.480]   with terrible battery life.
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:26.320]   I think Apple will only do it if they can make a battery
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:27.600]   which is huge.
[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:29.640]   I mean, some of the rumors about the new iPhone
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:31.800]   is that the screen is thinner.
[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:33.720]   My guess is they will take as much as possible
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:35.840]   of that extra space and make the battery larger.
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:36.680]   - The battery.
[01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:37.760]   - Even the connector being smaller might be
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:39.640]   so the battery can be larger.
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:41.800]   They really don't wanna say that we have an LTE phone,
[01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:44.880]   but the battery life is 30% lower.
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:45.880]   - Yeah.
[01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:48.040]   - This might be a very interesting fall.
[01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:51.960]   We're two of the biggest tech giants
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:53.800]   are potentially gonna stumble.
[01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:56.280]   Windows 8 and iPhone 5.
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:08:59.080]   - I think it's always a mistake to bet
[01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:00.640]   that Apple is gonna stumble.
[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:02.280]   - All right, so far it has been.
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:04.480]   - 99 of 100 times people--
[01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:06.800]   - On the other hand, nobody bats a thousand.
[01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:07.640]   - No.
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:09.480]   But--
[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:10.320]   - Well, but I mean,
[01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:13.080]   don't you have the whole lock in
[01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:15.000]   that Piper Jaffrey and Lestine Monster
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000]   keep talking about though?
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.120]   I mean, is it not secure enough?
[01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:18.960]   And there's also--
[01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:20.800]   - You mean because of app purchases,
[01:09:20.800 --> 01:09:22.320]   people have invested in apps?
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:23.160]   I don't think so.
[01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:24.000]   - Yeah, because of apps and because of video
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:24.840]   and things like that.
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:25.680]   - That's absolutely cheap enough.
[01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:28.800]   - I don't think people really consider that.
[01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:30.000]   - Leo, I don't know.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.160]   - Is it good?
[01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:33.560]   - That's a big consideration.
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:34.920]   I'm seriously thinking about--
[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:37.520]   - Most Android apps are cheap and more free.
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:39.280]   - Most Android apps are free.
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:40.960]   - I went through and totaled
[01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:43.240]   how much I've spent over time on app.
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:44.080]   - But that's a lot of work.
[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:45.400]   Most people don't do that.
[01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:47.640]   - No, but you're aware of it subconsciously.
[01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:49.760]   I mean, if you've bought, for example,
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:53.360]   if you've bought each one of Apple's pages
[01:09:53.360 --> 01:09:55.640]   and keynote and numbers,
[01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:58.280]   if you bought each one of those for iOS,
[01:09:58.280 --> 01:09:59.880]   that's 30 bucks.
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:02.920]   And while each one of them at $9.99 isn't that much.
[01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:04.960]   I've spent 30 bucks on productivity apps.
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:08.640]   Am I gonna have to go and do that again for Android?
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:12.920]   So the apps are a factor when you're thinking
[01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:14.440]   about making the leap.
[01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:17.080]   And I may end up doing it,
[01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:20.280]   but that is in the back of my mind an issue.
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:23.040]   (mouse clicking)
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:26.800]   - I'm not sure.
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:27.920]   I can't decide.
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:28.760]   Well, let me ask the,
[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:31.200]   there's, we got a good sample here.
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:33.600]   How many of you would consider moving
[01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:34.840]   to a different platform,
[01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:37.040]   Android, iPhone, iPhone to Android
[01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:41.520]   if there were a better phone and how can I phrase this?
[01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:43.800]   Regardless of the cost of apps,
[01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:45.440]   how important, I wanna know how important the app is.
[01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:48.800]   - If you had to, if you, if in order to do it,
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:51.760]   you had to repurchase all of the apps that you have now.
[01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:54.440]   - Would repurchasing the apps stop you?
[01:10:54.440 --> 01:10:55.720]   Yeah, yes.
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:11:00.240]   How many people wouldn't stop you?
[01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:01.080]   Most.
[01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:03.160]   I'm right.
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:04.440]   (laughing)
[01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:06.480]   Thank you, you'll all get cookies at the end.
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:07.320]   - Wait a minute.
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:08.160]   Wait a minute.
[01:11:08.160 --> 01:11:10.240]   (laughing)
[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:13.360]   - Chaperum, it's like it's evenly divided.
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:16.280]   And the key Leo is that it's in the back of my mind.
[01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:17.640]   When I'm losing your mind,
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:20.440]   it's certainly one of the inertia elements.
[01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:22.600]   I'm not saying there isn't some inertia,
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:23.600]   but is it enough?
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:24.480]   It's a speed bump,
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:26.000]   but is it enough of a speed bump to say,
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.840]   "No, I guess I'll stay with the iPhone,"
[01:11:27.840 --> 01:11:30.680]   even though it's not as cool anymore.
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:32.880]   - Right, and I'm also thinking about switching carriers
[01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:34.280]   'cause I'm with AT&T.
[01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:36.200]   - That's a speed, that's a bigger speed bump, I think.
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:38.840]   - Yes, and Verizon's LTE.
[01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:40.880]   I was on vacation for the last two weeks.
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:42.920]   I was in various parts of North Carolina
[01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:44.960]   and Missouri, South Carolina.
[01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:47.400]   And in very rural areas,
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:52.400]   I was really amazed at where I could find Verizon LTE.
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:58.040]   And how often AT&T was no signal at all.
[01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:01.240]   And so I'm seriously considering jumping to Verizon,
[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:04.600]   although I don't necessarily like their price structure.
[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:08.120]   And the shared data thing that they force you to do
[01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:09.760]   where AT&T gives you a choice.
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:12.160]   So there's an incredible number of factors
[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:16.200]   if you're changing platforms and carriers to think about.
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:18.960]   And it'll be interesting to see what kind of churn
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:22.520]   you get with a new iPhone if it's LTE and AT&T
[01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:25.520]   and Sprint and Verizon.
[01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:28.960]   Sprint's LTE, by the way, which is now available here
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:33.360]   in Houston is very spotty and it's relatively slow.
[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:38.280]   The other day on this Verizon Galaxy S3,
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:41.680]   I got 42 megabits down on Sprint,
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:44.840]   on an HTC phone I have for Sprint.
[01:12:44.840 --> 01:12:46.040]   Here in Houston, the best I've done
[01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:48.400]   is about six megabits down on LTE.
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:51.560]   I'm gonna make a prediction.
[01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:54.480]   I think both Windows 8 and iPhone 5
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:57.360]   are going to be surprising failures.
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:00.680]   I'm almost always wrong, by the way.
[01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:02.200]   I just wanna say.
[01:13:02.200 --> 01:13:03.520]   I was gonna say, are you doing that just?
[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:05.600]   I mean, so that people can say, oh my God.
[01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:08.000]   And then run to their respective Twitter accounts
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.240]   and say you wouldn't believe what Leo said?
[01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:11.480]   Yeah, I think everybody should tweet that.
[01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:14.880]   And if I, but see here, I've learned this from Devorak.
[01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:17.120]   If I'm wrong, oh yeah, it's a big deal.
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:19.760]   If I'm right, people go, wow, he's an Oracle.
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:23.080]   You only have to get one of these right every few years, right?
[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:26.200]   My guess is that the iPhone, the next iPhone,
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:28.200]   whatever it's called, will do just fine.
[01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:30.200]   And Windows 8, it'll just sort of be unclear
[01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:31.960]   for quite a while what's going on.
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:33.240]   Yeah.
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:34.280]   Yeah, it'll take a while.
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:35.760]   I mean, even that's not interesting.
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:37.800]   It's like, it's more and more interesting to say.
[01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:39.880]   They're gonna be horrible flops.
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:43.080]   I'll bet you a case of beer and a lobster.
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:45.520]   (chuckles)
[01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:46.720]   I think you're right though, Harry.
[01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:47.720]   We'll see.
[01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:48.800]   Here's your being reasonable.
[01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:50.480]   I'm just saying, it's not as interesting.
[01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:51.800]   And just looked at all these other people
[01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:53.800]   who get suckered into the idea of predicting
[01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:54.960]   that Apple is gonna fail.
[01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:55.800]   Right.
[01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:57.720]   And they do it on the web so people can go back
[01:13:57.720 --> 01:13:59.560]   and look at the fact that they predicted Apple would fail.
[01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:02.800]   All I can say is thank God I don't buy tech stocks.
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:04.600]   I don't have any skin in this game at all
[01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:06.080]   one way or the other.
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:06.920]   We're gonna take a break.
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:09.240]   Good panel, lots to talk about.
[01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:11.320]   We're gonna talk a little more about phones.
[01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:13.040]   The Facebook phone, our next topic.
[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:16.320]   But first, a word from our friends at FreshBooks,
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:17.400]   the best way to invoice.
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:20.360]   If you do invoicing, if you're in business,
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:24.200]   you know that sending out those invoices
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:25.240]   at the end of the month is just a pain.
[01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:27.880]   But you also know if you don't do it, you don't not get paid.
[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:29.440]   So wouldn't it be nice if there were a better
[01:14:29.440 --> 01:14:31.000]   and easier a faster way to do it?
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:31.880]   Yes, there is.
[01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:35.880]   It's called FreshBooks, the easy online invoicing app
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:36.720]   for small business.
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:39.760]   It'll save you time and it gets you paid faster.
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:43.480]   Because right there on the invoice,
[01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:45.240]   there's a button that says pay 'em.
[01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:46.080]   And you can pay 'em.
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:48.160]   They have all these great online payment services
[01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:50.960]   that makes it very easy for your clients to pay.
[01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:52.760]   It turns out they wanna pay you.
[01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:54.080]   They really do.
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:56.000]   Sometimes it's just as much of a pain for them
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.720]   to go through the invoices and pay 'em
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:14:59.400]   as it was for you to send 'em.
[01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:01.200]   So let's get the friction out of this.
[01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:04.800]   So you get paid faster, you get paid more easily.
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:07.680]   You could turn time sheets into invoices.
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:08.920]   They have an app for the iPhone.
[01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:10.600]   They also have a web app.
[01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:12.040]   It's great for tax time.
[01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:13.360]   You can run all sorts of reports
[01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:14.560]   to monitor your small business.
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:16.560]   Your accountant will just say, "Wow, this is great.
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:18.360]   I could do your taxes like that."
[01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:21.000]   Oh, and by the way, if they don't pay right away
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:22.760]   automated late payment or minors
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:24.240]   for follow up and so forth.
[01:15:24.240 --> 01:15:25.720]   They even will do physical invoices,
[01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:28.600]   the print and stamp 'em and mail 'em for you for a small fee.
[01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:30.000]   I love FreshBooks.
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:32.040]   When I discovered it, actually it was Amber MacArthur
[01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:33.360]   told me about it in 2004.
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:34.200]   It changed my life.
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:35.240]   I wanted to change yours.
[01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:37.240]   Visit FreshBooks.com.

[01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:51.720]   You don't have to, but if you want to.
[01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:54.760]   FreshBooks, really seriously, I'm not kidding.
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:56.360]   You really want this thing.
[01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:58.440]   FreshBooks.com.
[01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:01.360]   Web19 101 is set up a straw poll.
[01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:04.920]   I don't know, I gotta see what the question is.
[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:08.400]   iPhones ecosystem or Android's free apps, pick one.
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:13.280]   It's at straw poll.me/933.
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:15.800]   iPhone, Android, hey, I like Windows Phone,
[01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:17.480]   Blackberry fan here.
[01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:20.960]   I don't think there are many.
[01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:22.440]   I'm gonna vote for Android.
[01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:24.520]   Anyway, you can cast your vote and we'll see.
[01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:27.320]   The votes are coming in in real time, look at that.
[01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:28.400]   This is kinda cool.
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:30.120]   Real time's going.
[01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:31.680]   So this is in response to our question?
[01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:32.520]   Yeah.
[01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:33.360]   Ah, cool.
[01:16:33.360 --> 01:16:34.960]   Yeah, somebody in the chat room set that up.
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:39.960]   And straw poll.me/933.
[01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:41.800]   We should do this more often.
[01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:43.400]   I didn't know it had this real time thing.
[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:45.000]   That's kinda cool.
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.560]   As they come in, you can watch people vote.
[01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:49.240]   One Blackberry fan so far.
[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:51.120]   (laughing)
[01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:52.680]   iPhones winning.
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:55.720]   48 votes to 34 votes.
[01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:59.200]   Eight votes for Windows Phone, one Blackberry fan.
[01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:01.400]   But it's good, this is still pretty close.
[01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:03.200]   You know, it's almost 50/50.
[01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:05.120]   Well, it's 53.39.
[01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:07.480]   What's the number again, Leo?
[01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:08.720]   933.
[01:17:08.720 --> 01:17:10.720]   Straw poll.me/933.
[01:17:10.720 --> 01:17:11.960]   You know what, we're gonna do this more often.
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:13.640]   That's really cool.
[01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:14.480]   I love it.
[01:17:14.480 --> 01:17:15.720]   I've seen it before, but I've seen it before.
[01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:16.960]   But I didn't know it had a real time.
[01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:17.800]   That's neat.
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:20.000]   And this is an NSFW fan that made this.
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:20.840]   What?
[01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:25.840]   NSFW needed a polling system that wouldn't break under pressure.
[01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:27.320]   And this was made.
[01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:30.640]   How do we have such great people viewing us?
[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:31.880]   We have the best fans in the world.
[01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:32.800]   Best fans in the world.
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:33.640]   Thank you, Chad.
[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:35.280]   Straw poll.me/933.
[01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:36.960]   We'll keep an eye on that one.
[01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:38.280]   Can you do more than one vote?
[01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:40.600]   Or it watches your IP address.
[01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:41.880]   Pro, I'm sure they did it, right?
[01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:42.880]   Yeah.
[01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:43.720]   Yeah.
[01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:44.520]   (laughing)
[01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:49.000]   So, remember all of the speculation about a Facebook phone?
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.000]   And I kept saying, why would they do a phone?
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.560]   Mark Zuckerberg says, no.
[01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:54.680]   Why would we do a phone?
[01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:57.200]   It wouldn't make sense for us to do a phone.
[01:17:57.200 --> 01:17:59.520]   It was on the earnings call, by the way.
[01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:01.680]   Here's another surprise.
[01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:05.640]   Facebook's earnings going down again.
[01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:08.320]   Online sales, ad sales soft.
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:13.280]   Zuckerberg Feds at Facebook is the most used app
[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:17.400]   on all platforms, Android, iPhone, BlackBerry, whatever.
[01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:19.440]   So there's little need to get into hardware.
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:21.240]   I thought that all along.
[01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:25.640]   Facebook's stock price is now 23 bucks.
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:28.760]   It was $38 at its IPO.
[01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:31.140]   23 bucks.
[01:18:31.980 --> 01:18:36.300]   I guess we can now officially call it a failed IPO.
[01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:37.140]   Yes?
[01:18:37.140 --> 01:18:40.380]   Mm, I don't know.
[01:18:40.380 --> 01:18:41.620]   I mean, I think it's too early.
[01:18:41.620 --> 01:18:43.380]   I think people wanna say right away,
[01:18:43.380 --> 01:18:46.780]   oh, it's a hit or oh, it's not, you know, Apple.
[01:18:46.780 --> 01:18:50.500]   You know, shortly after it's IPO took a dive
[01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:53.940]   and about a year afterwards, it was just kind of stalled out
[01:18:53.940 --> 01:18:56.940]   and I sold my Apple stock.
[01:18:56.940 --> 01:18:57.780]   I bought it.
[01:18:57.780 --> 01:18:59.340]   (laughing)
[01:18:59.340 --> 01:19:01.220]   Yeah, after the IPO.
[01:19:01.220 --> 01:19:03.820]   But so I don't necessarily, I think it's too early,
[01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:06.340]   but I think what we're learning is that Facebook
[01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:09.020]   is just another business, internet business,
[01:19:09.020 --> 01:19:12.500]   supported by advertising, which is hard to do.
[01:19:12.500 --> 01:19:15.340]   I think people kind of were dazzled by, you know,
[01:19:15.340 --> 01:19:18.980]   Facebook's history and the movie and certainly it's growth.
[01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:22.420]   You know, it's got, you know, almost a billion users,
[01:19:22.420 --> 01:19:24.300]   but at the same time monetizing them
[01:19:24.300 --> 01:19:26.420]   is not easy with advertising.
[01:19:26.420 --> 01:19:27.260]   They need to come up.
[01:19:27.260 --> 01:19:31.940]   And this was, the bet was, I thought Facebook was a strong IPO
[01:19:31.940 --> 01:19:34.180]   and the bet was they have some magic sauce
[01:19:34.180 --> 01:19:36.500]   that's gonna make money for them in online advertising,
[01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:38.500]   but if it's just more click banner ads, it's not gonna go.
[01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:39.500]   So far they haven't found it.
[01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:40.340]   They haven't found it.
[01:19:40.340 --> 01:19:41.940]   It's not like Google, which truly did come up
[01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:44.660]   with an amazing way to do online advertising
[01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:45.700]   before it went public.
[01:19:45.700 --> 01:19:46.540]   Right.
[01:19:46.540 --> 01:19:48.420]   It was so relevant to what you were searching for.
[01:19:48.420 --> 01:19:49.260]   Right.
[01:19:49.260 --> 01:19:51.660]   And I don't see relevant ads when I use Facebook.
[01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:52.940]   No, they're horrible.
[01:19:52.940 --> 01:19:54.180]   They're worthless.
[01:19:54.180 --> 01:19:55.020]   For a lot of things.
[01:19:55.020 --> 01:19:55.860]   Yeah, I like fake.
[01:19:55.860 --> 01:19:57.540]   Now, am I the only one who likes Facebook?
[01:19:57.540 --> 01:19:58.380]   'Cause that's the other thing.
[01:19:58.380 --> 01:19:59.940]   We keep seeing balls of people hate Facebook.
[01:19:59.940 --> 01:20:01.140]   They just have to use it.
[01:20:01.140 --> 01:20:01.980]   I like Facebook.
[01:20:01.980 --> 01:20:02.820]   I like it.
[01:20:02.820 --> 01:20:04.620]   I don't like it as much as Twitter, but I do like it.
[01:20:04.620 --> 01:20:05.620]   I like Twitter too.
[01:20:05.620 --> 01:20:11.420]   Speaking of the Twitter, a couple of Twitter stories,
[01:20:11.420 --> 01:20:14.700]   Apple reported, see, this is a dumb story.
[01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:15.940]   Okay, I'm sorry.
[01:20:15.940 --> 01:20:19.140]   This is in the New York Times technology section,
[01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:20.780]   Evelyn, Bruce Lee and Nick Bilton,
[01:20:20.780 --> 01:20:23.140]   who I love, Nick's a good friend.
[01:20:23.140 --> 01:20:25.660]   Apple officials said to consider steak and Twitter.
[01:20:25.660 --> 01:20:27.060]   That's like meaningless.
[01:20:27.060 --> 01:20:28.620]   I considered a steak in Twitter
[01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:31.260]   and then rejected it when I found out how much they wanted.
[01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:34.060]   Anybody could consider a steak.
[01:20:34.060 --> 01:20:35.300]   And then the Wall Street Journal said
[01:20:35.300 --> 01:20:37.220]   that they did their considering a year ago.
[01:20:37.220 --> 01:20:39.140]   Come on. (laughs)
[01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:40.980]   Apple has considered an investment
[01:20:40.980 --> 01:20:43.660]   in the hundreds of millions of dollars,
[01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:47.220]   one that could value Twitter at more than $10 billion.
[01:20:47.220 --> 01:20:49.140]   These, this is what I hate.
[01:20:49.140 --> 01:20:52.220]   I hate this kind of blind source stuff, right?
[01:20:52.220 --> 01:20:54.140]   People briefed in the matter.
[01:20:55.060 --> 01:20:57.660]   These people said they declined to be named
[01:20:57.660 --> 01:20:59.460]   because discussions were private.
[01:20:59.460 --> 01:21:02.020]   Even that partisan bother me,
[01:21:02.020 --> 01:21:04.540]   but when you get four paragraphs into it,
[01:21:04.540 --> 01:21:06.380]   is when they say, oh, by the way,
[01:21:06.380 --> 01:21:07.780]   these talks aren't actually happening now
[01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:09.420]   and we don't know if they'll ever come back.
[01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:10.460]   And then the rest of the story is,
[01:21:10.460 --> 01:21:12.460]   but if they do, wouldn't it be neat?
[01:21:12.460 --> 01:21:13.460]   And you're just wondering.
[01:21:13.460 --> 01:21:15.140]   So, it's like, it like went from,
[01:21:15.140 --> 01:21:17.940]   it went from, forgive me because I'm not a front-channelist,
[01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:20.940]   it went from reporting to sort of like a short story.
[01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:22.100]   Like, well, here's what would be neat
[01:21:22.100 --> 01:21:22.940]   and here's why it could happen.
[01:21:22.940 --> 01:21:24.820]   Can I say something together?
[01:21:24.820 --> 01:21:28.460]   In technology anyway, the Times has been doing that more and more.
[01:21:28.460 --> 01:21:31.340]   Very speculative stuff.
[01:21:31.340 --> 01:21:34.300]   Well, so it's a journal too, they both have.
[01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:36.620]   The journal, it feels like they have sources.
[01:21:36.620 --> 01:21:39.580]   Like Apple, like Apple's, what it really feels like is,
[01:21:39.580 --> 01:21:40.780]   Apple's calling them up and saying,
[01:21:40.780 --> 01:21:42.900]   hey, could you write a story that says?
[01:21:42.900 --> 01:21:45.540]   So here's a bunch of biggie stuff.
[01:21:45.540 --> 01:21:48.620]   I'm sorry, there was a bunch of, really quickly,
[01:21:48.620 --> 01:21:49.860]   there was a bunch of biggie stuff that happened
[01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:50.700]   at the end of the last week.
[01:21:50.700 --> 01:21:52.020]   And we kind of talked about this last time
[01:21:52.020 --> 01:21:53.660]   I was on Macbreak with you, Leo,
[01:21:53.660 --> 01:21:56.700]   and the whole, the whole thing about how much it sucks
[01:21:56.700 --> 01:21:57.620]   to work at Apple Retail.
[01:21:57.620 --> 01:21:58.900]   Yeah.
[01:21:58.900 --> 01:22:03.020]   So there was a story about an explosion at an Apple supplier.
[01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:03.860]   Right.
[01:22:03.860 --> 01:22:05.420]   Or a gas leak at an Apple supplier this weekend.
[01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:07.140]   One person dead, four people injured,
[01:22:07.140 --> 01:22:09.420]   or five people I guess dead, one of them.
[01:22:09.420 --> 01:22:12.900]   No, one person died, four people are injured.
[01:22:12.900 --> 01:22:15.660]   And then when you read more into the story,
[01:22:15.660 --> 01:22:17.980]   it turns out that that same company, Catcher,
[01:22:17.980 --> 01:22:22.060]   is also a supplier for Dell and for HP and Lenovo.
[01:22:22.060 --> 01:22:23.660]   And I cannot remember who the other one was.
[01:22:23.660 --> 01:22:25.540]   And then come to find out it was actually something
[01:22:25.540 --> 01:22:28.540]   that happened in their waste water treatment facility.
[01:22:28.540 --> 01:22:31.060]   Had nothing to do with anybody's manufacturing at all.
[01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:34.700]   But a number of reputable news organizations said,
[01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:39.020]   explosion or a gas leak at Apple supplier,
[01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:40.300]   enters and kills.
[01:22:40.300 --> 01:22:43.100]   And it's sort of, I mean, it's linkbaity
[01:22:43.100 --> 01:22:44.140]   and it's sort of awful.
[01:22:44.140 --> 01:22:45.460]   And it's a terrible story.
[01:22:45.460 --> 01:22:46.620]   And the thing is, it's a tragic story.
[01:22:46.620 --> 01:22:47.980]   And it's something that we should,
[01:22:47.980 --> 01:22:49.300]   if we're interested in that kind of thing,
[01:22:49.300 --> 01:22:50.460]   we should pay attention to.
[01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:53.500]   But dispatching Apple's name on the front of it, one, I mean.
[01:22:53.500 --> 01:22:56.900]   It's clearly a bid to get views.
[01:22:56.900 --> 01:22:59.780]   And it has nothing to do with the story.
[01:22:59.780 --> 01:23:01.780]   And I'm seeing that more and more,
[01:23:01.780 --> 01:23:03.420]   I expect it from blogs.
[01:23:03.420 --> 01:23:05.900]   That's, you know, Mashable, of course,
[01:23:05.900 --> 01:23:07.380]   they're gonna have linkbaity.
[01:23:07.380 --> 01:23:09.820]   Tech Crunch, of course, it's gonna have linkbaity.
[01:23:09.820 --> 01:23:12.220]   But from the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal,
[01:23:12.220 --> 01:23:13.220]   I hate to see that.
[01:23:13.220 --> 01:23:17.260]   I'm just, maybe I have an illusion about these guys that,
[01:23:17.260 --> 01:23:19.860]   I don't know, Houston Chronicle would never do that.
[01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:20.700]   Would they do I?
[01:23:20.700 --> 01:23:22.820]   Oh, never, never, never, not at all.
[01:23:22.820 --> 01:23:25.780]   Is there so much pressure now to get clicks
[01:23:25.780 --> 01:23:27.460]   that you have to do this?
[01:23:27.460 --> 01:23:30.620]   Well, I think that what they're doing is,
[01:23:30.620 --> 01:23:34.500]   you have a story, Apple is, you know,
[01:23:34.500 --> 01:23:37.060]   that company does supply things to Apple.
[01:23:37.060 --> 01:23:39.420]   You want people to pay attention to it.
[01:23:39.420 --> 01:23:42.860]   And so the editor says, or maybe the reporter says,
[01:23:42.860 --> 01:23:45.140]   put Apple in the lead.
[01:23:45.140 --> 01:23:47.260]   And so Apple goes in the lead.
[01:23:48.220 --> 01:23:51.500]   The reporter may actually have written it with, you know,
[01:23:51.500 --> 01:23:55.620]   straight and the editor sees, oh, this is Apple.
[01:23:55.620 --> 01:23:57.620]   You know, let's put them in the lead.
[01:23:57.620 --> 01:24:02.340]   The more ethical thing to do would be, you know,
[01:24:02.340 --> 01:24:05.740]   to write the story strictly that a supplier for Apple
[01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:08.140]   and many other, if you wanna do that.
[01:24:08.140 --> 01:24:11.180]   And then make sure you make clear, very high up, you know,
[01:24:11.180 --> 01:24:13.420]   that it was wastewater and that it wasn't involved
[01:24:13.420 --> 01:24:14.380]   in the manufacturing process.
[01:24:14.380 --> 01:24:16.460]   And you do that in the second graph.
[01:24:16.460 --> 01:24:18.340]   That's probably the better way to do that story
[01:24:18.340 --> 01:24:20.820]   and still get the point that this is part of Apple.
[01:24:20.820 --> 01:24:25.660]   The other thing is, is there's a backstory involving Apple
[01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:29.380]   and safety and the previous explosion in the Foxconn plant.
[01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:31.460]   And so I think that people, you know,
[01:24:31.460 --> 01:24:33.820]   they want to invoke kind of that memory of it,
[01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:35.580]   the whole issue of safety in this.
[01:24:35.580 --> 01:24:37.820]   But, you know, it's all in the writing
[01:24:37.820 --> 01:24:38.980]   and it's all in the presentation.
[01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:41.380]   And the way that story was structured,
[01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:43.620]   yeah, that was not correctly done.
[01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:45.180]   It's also part of the year-long narrative
[01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:47.780]   that started with Mike Daisy in the New York Times too, right?
[01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:48.620]   - Right, which not only-
[01:24:48.620 --> 01:24:50.300]   - Assistive and debunked.
[01:24:50.300 --> 01:24:51.980]   - But they just don't care.
[01:24:51.980 --> 01:24:56.660]   And that's, I mean, that's been sort of a running throughout the year.
[01:24:56.660 --> 01:24:57.980]   Right, even though it has been debunked,
[01:24:57.980 --> 01:24:59.900]   at least as far as the Mike Daisy part is concerned.
[01:24:59.900 --> 01:25:01.660]   And certainly, Apple has done some stuff.
[01:25:01.660 --> 01:25:03.460]   And I don't mean, I mean, I don't mean to make it sound
[01:25:03.460 --> 01:25:06.780]   like Apple can do no wrong, because certainly they can.
[01:25:06.780 --> 01:25:09.900]   Things at Foxconn have been bad for a long time,
[01:25:09.900 --> 01:25:12.180]   especially by our standards, but by, you know,
[01:25:12.180 --> 01:25:13.220]   the standards of some of the people
[01:25:13.220 --> 01:25:14.900]   that we're gonna join as well.
[01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:17.780]   But I mean, it just felt like it was part of that same thing.
[01:25:17.780 --> 01:25:21.540]   Oh, here's Apple, not given the exploitive deleted
[01:25:21.540 --> 01:25:22.820]   about their workers again.
[01:25:22.820 --> 01:25:25.540]   And, you know, when there was really a lot more going on
[01:25:25.540 --> 01:25:29.020]   and very little, if any of it had actually to do with Apple.
[01:25:29.020 --> 01:25:31.180]   - So, it wasn't the Wall Street Journal
[01:25:31.180 --> 01:25:34.380]   where the government, they said the government
[01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:36.180]   invented the internet.
[01:25:36.180 --> 01:25:39.820]   Gordon Croweitz is, that was an opinion piece though, right?
[01:25:39.820 --> 01:25:42.060]   Or wasn't- - It was an opinion piece
[01:25:42.060 --> 01:25:43.660]   full of things that weren't true.
[01:25:43.660 --> 01:25:44.580]   - That was lies.
[01:25:44.580 --> 01:25:47.460]   - He said that Xerox invented the internet.
[01:25:47.460 --> 01:25:49.500]   And you can't find a small person.
[01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:50.940]   - I think at no point was Xerox involved.
[01:25:50.940 --> 01:25:52.580]   - You can't find a single person who knows anything
[01:25:52.580 --> 01:25:53.620]   about the history of the internet,
[01:25:53.620 --> 01:25:54.820]   who believes that Xerox invented the internet.
[01:25:54.820 --> 01:25:57.140]   - And of course, Vitt Cerf, who actually did invent the internet,
[01:25:57.140 --> 01:25:59.300]   was quick to debunk it saying,
[01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:01.420]   Croweitz's article was full of stuff he could use
[01:26:01.420 --> 01:26:02.740]   to fertilize his garden.
[01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:04.340]   - And the guy who wrote the book about Xerox,
[01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:07.420]   that Croweitz cited, that Croweitz doesn't know
[01:26:07.420 --> 01:26:09.260]   what he's talking about.
[01:26:09.260 --> 01:26:11.100]   - The government in fact did invent the internet,
[01:26:11.100 --> 01:26:12.460]   just so people know.
[01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:14.820]   - Well, the government was involved in the internet.
[01:26:14.820 --> 01:26:19.300]   It's really- - The government invented
[01:26:19.300 --> 01:26:21.620]   something kind of rudimentary a long time.
[01:26:21.620 --> 01:26:24.860]   - And they hired BBN to create the internet.
[01:26:24.860 --> 01:26:25.700]   - The internet.
[01:26:25.700 --> 01:26:27.340]   And if you want to learn the story,
[01:26:27.340 --> 01:26:29.100]   there's a great book by Katie Haffner called,
[01:26:29.100 --> 01:26:30.300]   "Where Wizards Stay Up Late."
[01:26:30.300 --> 01:26:33.340]   It's a wonderful story about James Licklider
[01:26:33.340 --> 01:26:36.060]   and he was at the Defense Department,
[01:26:36.060 --> 01:26:38.100]   saying, "We gotta get these computers talking."
[01:26:38.100 --> 01:26:40.220]   They brought in BBN in Boston.
[01:26:40.220 --> 01:26:43.140]   They developed protocols that would make it possible.
[01:26:43.140 --> 01:26:46.180]   TCP/IP, Vince Serf invented that.
[01:26:46.180 --> 01:26:49.780]   It was Stanford and who were the,
[01:26:49.780 --> 01:26:53.060]   no, it was the SRI, maybe the first two connections.
[01:26:53.060 --> 01:26:55.420]   Government funded the whole thing for crying out loud.
[01:26:55.420 --> 01:26:58.500]   In fact, anybody who's been around for any length of time,
[01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:00.860]   and I guess probably all of you were in this group,
[01:27:00.860 --> 01:27:03.140]   remembers when the, remember the National Science Foundation,
[01:27:03.140 --> 01:27:05.500]   which was funding the internet backbone,
[01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:07.860]   said, "Okay, we're gonna let commercial companies
[01:27:07.860 --> 01:27:10.220]   "be involved now and we're gonna let Sprint and AT&T
[01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:12.620]   "and others and we're gonna allow commercial traffic."
[01:27:12.620 --> 01:27:14.660]   That was not so long, it was like 94.
[01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:18.300]   That changed it, that's when you first got commercialism
[01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:19.620]   on the internet.
[01:27:19.620 --> 01:27:21.580]   - Well, 90, I think was with 90.
[01:27:21.580 --> 01:27:22.940]   - Yeah, remember that?
[01:27:22.940 --> 01:27:25.620]   - Right, well, they allowed commercial traffic.
[01:27:25.620 --> 01:27:28.940]   The NSF continued to run it and then turned it over,
[01:27:28.940 --> 01:27:31.420]   I think maybe in the 93, 94 time frame.
[01:27:31.420 --> 01:27:32.260]   - Right, that's where I'm going to be.
[01:27:32.260 --> 01:27:36.260]   - And there was a huge, huge outcry from internet purists
[01:27:36.260 --> 01:27:38.340]   who were afraid that the internet would go all to hell
[01:27:38.340 --> 01:27:42.500]   if AT&T and Sprint ran it and MCI.
[01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:44.740]   And of course that didn't happen.
[01:27:44.740 --> 01:27:46.340]   Well, it may have happened depending on--
[01:27:46.340 --> 01:27:49.380]   - I don't know, it might have.
[01:27:49.380 --> 01:27:54.380]   687 votes on our poll at strawpole.me/933, it slowed down.
[01:27:54.380 --> 01:27:57.860]   Boy, it's almost neck and neck.
[01:27:57.860 --> 01:28:01.180]   iPhone's ecosystem are Android's free apps.
[01:28:01.180 --> 01:28:02.580]   That might have been a little bit slanted
[01:28:02.580 --> 01:28:05.500]   the way that was phrased, but 47% iPhone,
[01:28:05.500 --> 01:28:08.900]   43% Android, 6% Windows Phone,
[01:28:08.900 --> 01:28:11.300]   and 23 Blackberry fans.
[01:28:11.300 --> 01:28:12.140]   - Yeah, I've been watching it.
[01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:13.980]   It's been neck and neck since it was launched.
[01:28:13.980 --> 01:28:15.500]   - Oh, it's more votes now, wait a minute.
[01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:16.940]   (laughing)
[01:28:16.940 --> 01:28:18.140]   I shouldn't have mentioned it.
[01:28:18.140 --> 01:28:19.420]   (laughing)
[01:28:19.420 --> 01:28:22.140]   This is great, we're gonna do this in every show from now on.
[01:28:22.140 --> 01:28:25.180]   - And I forgot to mention Dan Dierks was the creator of this.
[01:28:25.180 --> 01:28:26.460]   - You can see his name at the bottom,
[01:28:26.460 --> 01:28:30.100]   but Dan is so unassuming that he put it
[01:28:30.100 --> 01:28:33.220]   in a completely un-elegible font.
[01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:36.820]   So it's down there, very, very dark.
[01:28:36.820 --> 01:28:37.940]   I can't even read it.
[01:28:37.940 --> 01:28:40.260]   - Dark blue on black. - Dark blue on black.
[01:28:40.260 --> 01:28:43.700]   Hey, by the way, just a plug,
[01:28:43.700 --> 01:28:46.500]   I'm gonna be doing a Reddit Ask Me Anything.
[01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:51.300]   On Tuesday, we'll start that 5 p.m. Pacific, 8 p.m. Eastern time.
[01:28:51.300 --> 01:28:53.580]   If you go to Reddit's AMA section,
[01:28:53.580 --> 01:28:55.460]   you can see they have a schedule
[01:28:55.460 --> 01:28:57.660]   of all the different AMAs.
[01:28:57.660 --> 01:29:00.980]   I, as ACTAR, did one a couple of days ago,
[01:29:00.980 --> 01:29:02.860]   or maybe a week or two ago,
[01:29:02.860 --> 01:29:05.300]   and it went great.
[01:29:05.300 --> 01:29:06.700]   And we thought it'd be fun to do it.
[01:29:06.700 --> 01:29:09.620]   Ask Me Anything is a great feature of Reddit,
[01:29:09.620 --> 01:29:11.700]   where you just say, "Hey, I'm Leo LaPorte,
[01:29:11.700 --> 01:29:13.340]   "I was on tech TV."
[01:29:13.340 --> 01:29:18.380]   And if you wanna ask me anything about Twitter, tech TV do,
[01:29:18.380 --> 01:29:22.940]   8 p.m. Eastern, July 31st, please participate.
[01:29:22.940 --> 01:29:24.620]   It'll be fun, I'm looking forward to it.
[01:29:24.620 --> 01:29:27.340]   And yes, it's not gonna ask me almost anything,
[01:29:27.340 --> 01:29:29.060]   it's gonna ask me anything.
[01:29:29.060 --> 01:29:31.180]   Dick D. Bartolo, Mad Magazine's Manist writer,
[01:29:31.180 --> 01:29:32.980]   will be doing it August 2nd.
[01:29:32.980 --> 01:29:34.420]   I think that'll be very interesting.
[01:29:34.420 --> 01:29:37.340]   Stan Lee's gonna do one August 14th.
[01:29:37.340 --> 01:29:38.180]   That's fun.
[01:29:38.180 --> 01:29:40.300]   Hand Zimmer, coming up.
[01:29:40.300 --> 01:29:42.940]   I just love it.
[01:29:42.940 --> 01:29:45.580]   And the truth is the most interesting AMAs are not celebrities.
[01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:48.380]   They're people, you know, I am a truck driver.
[01:29:48.380 --> 01:29:51.220]   And you just always wanna know, where do you pee?
[01:29:51.220 --> 01:29:54.540]   And then that just, you know, goes on and on and on.
[01:29:54.540 --> 01:29:55.380]   So, hey.
[01:29:55.380 --> 01:29:58.020]   - Joe Ayo, do you think Mitt Romney and Barack Obama
[01:29:58.020 --> 01:29:58.860]   will do one?
[01:29:58.860 --> 01:30:00.020]   - I would love to--
[01:30:00.020 --> 01:30:02.060]   - That's the kind of thing that would transform
[01:30:02.060 --> 01:30:04.020]   electoral politics in this country.
[01:30:04.020 --> 01:30:04.860]   - Yeah.
[01:30:04.860 --> 01:30:06.620]   - Never happen, that's why.
[01:30:06.620 --> 01:30:08.900]   I think, well, I don't know, I could, I don't know.
[01:30:08.900 --> 01:30:10.340]   I think it could happen, maybe.
[01:30:10.340 --> 01:30:11.340]   Maybe.
[01:30:11.340 --> 01:30:13.460]   I, ah, ah, good question.
[01:30:13.460 --> 01:30:14.820]   Shout-room said, well, I can ask you anything,
[01:30:14.820 --> 01:30:16.740]   but you will, will you answer anything?
[01:30:16.740 --> 01:30:19.340]   Mm, we'll see.
[01:30:19.340 --> 01:30:20.540]   Ask all you want.
[01:30:20.540 --> 01:30:21.860]   No, I will answer anything.
[01:30:21.860 --> 01:30:24.380]   I will be very absolutely candid, why not, what the hell?
[01:30:24.380 --> 01:30:25.460]   Reddit, I got no secrets.
[01:30:25.460 --> 01:30:28.420]   Reddit.com, boxers,
[01:30:28.420 --> 01:30:31.340]   slash I-A-M-A, right?
[01:30:31.340 --> 01:30:34.380]   Or slash R slash I-A-M-A for ask me anything.
[01:30:34.380 --> 01:30:37.700]   That'll be fun Tuesday and I hope you'll stop by.
[01:30:37.700 --> 01:30:38.700]   AOL has re--
[01:30:38.700 --> 01:30:40.780]   (laughs)
[01:30:40.780 --> 01:30:43.940]   I don't know why I'm looking at this article.
[01:30:43.940 --> 01:30:45.780]   Where did this, 'cause this a link in our,
[01:30:45.780 --> 01:30:49.260]   to keep its 24 million users from fleeing AOL redesigns
[01:30:49.260 --> 01:30:50.100]   its mail.
[01:30:50.100 --> 01:30:54.220]   That is a story you will not hear on Twitter.
[01:30:54.220 --> 01:30:55.220]   (laughs)
[01:30:55.220 --> 01:30:57.060]   I don't know, who cares?
[01:30:58.340 --> 01:30:59.700]   Does anybody care?
[01:30:59.700 --> 01:31:02.740]   (slaps)
[01:31:02.740 --> 01:31:03.580]   Not me.
[01:31:03.580 --> 01:31:05.900]   What did I say we were gonna talk about
[01:31:05.900 --> 01:31:06.740]   when we came back?
[01:31:06.740 --> 01:31:07.580]   Did we talk about it?
[01:31:07.580 --> 01:31:08.420]   Twitter?
[01:31:08.420 --> 01:31:11.620]   Um, a year ago?
[01:31:11.620 --> 01:31:13.940]   I think it was the Facebook phone, wasn't it?
[01:31:13.940 --> 01:31:15.500]   Facebook phone, you're right.
[01:31:15.500 --> 01:31:20.500]   We mentioned Samsung at $5.9 billion profit.
[01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:24.860]   And believe it or not, even though Samsung makes everything
[01:31:24.860 --> 01:31:29.860]   from dishwashers to bulldozers, a significant amount of that
[01:31:29.860 --> 01:31:32.620]   from phone sales.
[01:31:32.620 --> 01:31:37.420]   79.79% increase.
[01:31:37.420 --> 01:31:40.060]   This year, Samsung unseated Nokia
[01:31:40.060 --> 01:31:42.620]   as the number one phone manufacturer,
[01:31:42.620 --> 01:31:46.540]   50 million phones sold.
[01:31:46.540 --> 01:31:49.580]   They also are the world's top TV maker.
[01:31:49.580 --> 01:31:53.460]   And the world's top bulldozer may impact.
[01:31:53.460 --> 01:31:54.300]   No, I don't know.
[01:31:54.300 --> 01:31:56.660]   They may not be, I just, I don't know who,
[01:31:56.660 --> 01:31:58.500]   I don't know who is the biggest bulldozer.
[01:31:58.500 --> 01:31:59.340]   I thought that was a picture.
[01:31:59.340 --> 01:32:00.580]   I think it's Caterpillar.
[01:32:00.580 --> 01:32:04.820]   No, no, no, it's got to be a Korean company.
[01:32:04.820 --> 01:32:06.740]   Dihatsu or somebody.
[01:32:06.740 --> 01:32:10.300]   Who is the number one, all right, chatroom to work,
[01:32:10.300 --> 01:32:11.900]   kamatsu, that's it.
[01:32:11.900 --> 01:32:13.380]   Hyundai.
[01:32:13.380 --> 01:32:14.780]   Cat, really Caterpillar?
[01:32:14.780 --> 01:32:17.380]   Who is, find out, there's somebody who's got to know this.
[01:32:17.380 --> 01:32:20.100]   The number one bulldozer manufacturer in the world.
[01:32:23.020 --> 01:32:25.820]   Yeah, used to work with a financial analyst on TV.
[01:32:25.820 --> 01:32:28.420]   How do you find that stuff out?
[01:32:28.420 --> 01:32:30.660]   He always said that Caterpillar was like,
[01:32:30.660 --> 01:32:32.860]   was a big investment as China's middle class started growing
[01:32:32.860 --> 01:32:34.300]   as they started gearing up for the Olympics.
[01:32:34.300 --> 01:32:36.820]   So this was a while ago that I was working with them.
[01:32:36.820 --> 01:32:38.740]   I don't think Caterpillar was huge.
[01:32:38.740 --> 01:32:40.900]   Scotland calling is saying it's Ikea.
[01:32:40.900 --> 01:32:42.140]   I don't think it's Ikea.
[01:32:42.140 --> 01:32:44.860]   I could be wrong.
[01:32:44.860 --> 01:32:46.660]   You have to assemble the Ikea bulldozer
[01:32:46.660 --> 01:32:47.620]   before you use it.
[01:32:47.620 --> 01:32:49.900]   This and your little Alan Renschen
[01:32:49.900 --> 01:32:51.500]   and some indecipherable instructions.
[01:32:51.500 --> 01:32:53.780]   Then you're go, you go, baby.
[01:32:53.780 --> 01:32:55.740]   This portion of the show brought to you by Stamps.com.
[01:32:55.740 --> 01:32:57.180]   When's the last time you went to the post office?
[01:32:57.180 --> 01:32:57.940]   Long line, right?
[01:32:57.940 --> 01:32:59.500]   Hard to park, paint in the butt.
[01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:02.060]   Cerly employees, not anymore.
[01:33:02.060 --> 01:33:04.420]   Now if this employees at the post office are surely,
[01:33:04.420 --> 01:33:06.180]   it's your fault because Stamps.com
[01:33:06.180 --> 01:33:09.220]   brings a post office to right here, to your desk.
[01:33:09.220 --> 01:33:10.620]   It's so great.
[01:33:10.620 --> 01:33:12.260]   You're gonna love Stamps.com.
[01:33:12.260 --> 01:33:14.500]   Let's you print basically the fundamental,
[01:33:14.500 --> 01:33:16.740]   the bottom line, the elevator pitches.
[01:33:16.740 --> 01:33:18.140]   What if you could print postage
[01:33:18.140 --> 01:33:20.020]   from your computer, your printer?
[01:33:20.020 --> 01:33:23.140]   No special link, no postage meter, just Stamps.com.
[01:33:23.140 --> 01:33:23.980]   Now wouldn't that be cool?
[01:33:23.980 --> 01:33:25.620]   What if I throw in a USB scale?
[01:33:25.620 --> 01:33:27.980]   It means you just plop that letter of package on there.
[01:33:27.980 --> 01:33:29.700]   You know exactly what the postage is.
[01:33:29.700 --> 01:33:32.060]   You don't have to type it in, it just does it.
[01:33:32.060 --> 01:33:33.260]   I could make it even better.
[01:33:33.260 --> 01:33:34.580]   What if you could print right on the envelope
[01:33:34.580 --> 01:33:35.620]   with your company's logo?
[01:33:35.620 --> 01:33:37.180]   It looks so professional.
[01:33:37.180 --> 01:33:40.500]   And you could pull the name and address from QuickBooks,
[01:33:40.500 --> 01:33:41.300]   if that's what you use.
[01:33:41.300 --> 01:33:43.300]   If you're an Amazon or eBay seller,
[01:33:43.300 --> 01:33:44.180]   you can use that.
[01:33:44.180 --> 01:33:45.500]   It'll automatically do it.
[01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:46.900]   If it's international postage,
[01:33:46.900 --> 01:33:48.500]   it'll print out all the forms you need.
[01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:50.380]   Now how much would you pay?
[01:33:50.380 --> 01:33:51.220]   How about nothing?
[01:33:51.220 --> 01:33:53.140]   How about Stamps.com for 30 days?
[01:33:53.140 --> 01:33:54.020]   And no risk trial.
[01:33:54.020 --> 01:33:55.620]   Wait a minute, wait a minute, stop.
[01:33:55.620 --> 01:33:56.460]   Stop.
[01:33:56.460 --> 01:33:59.900]   You went to Stamps.com and I see that $80 special values.
[01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:01.900]   That's a good deal.
[01:34:01.900 --> 01:34:02.740]   That's a good deal.
[01:34:02.740 --> 01:34:04.660]   Nothing wrong with $80 free, but how about this?
[01:34:04.660 --> 01:34:07.300]   Click that microphone in the upper right-hand corner
[01:34:07.300 --> 01:34:08.980]   and enter the offer code TWIT.
[01:34:08.980 --> 01:34:09.980]   Now see what happens.
[01:34:09.980 --> 01:34:12.860]   T, W, I, T, press the go.
[01:34:12.860 --> 01:34:14.500]   And whoa!
[01:34:14.500 --> 01:34:17.100]   Just went to $110.
[01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:19.900]   $55 in free postage.
[01:34:19.900 --> 01:34:21.180]   You get that scale for free.
[01:34:21.180 --> 01:34:23.220]   You just pay $5 shipping and handling.
[01:34:23.220 --> 01:34:25.780]   To make that up, they give you a $5 supply kit
[01:34:25.780 --> 01:34:27.900]   and a four-week trial.
[01:34:27.900 --> 01:34:29.420]   Now how much would you pay?
[01:34:29.420 --> 01:34:30.220]   Nothing.
[01:34:30.220 --> 01:34:31.860]   Stamps.com, you're gonna love it.
[01:34:31.860 --> 01:34:33.500]   It's really, really great.
[01:34:33.500 --> 01:34:34.940]   Stop going to the post office.
[01:34:34.940 --> 01:34:37.700]   By the way, post office loves Stamps.com.
[01:34:37.700 --> 01:34:38.540]   They give you discounts.
[01:34:38.540 --> 01:34:39.900]   You can't get it to post office.
[01:34:39.900 --> 01:34:44.660]   21%, up to 21%, on Express Mail up to 15% on Priority Mail.
[01:34:44.660 --> 01:34:46.980]   I don't know why you're not using Stamps.com right now.
[01:34:46.980 --> 01:34:48.660]   Go ahead and try it.
[01:34:48.660 --> 01:34:50.820]   Let me tell you, the people in Canada
[01:34:50.820 --> 01:34:51.940]   wish they had Stamps.com.
[01:34:51.940 --> 01:34:52.940]   The people in Great Britain,
[01:34:52.940 --> 01:34:54.380]   they're watching this right now going,
[01:34:54.380 --> 01:34:56.180]   we may have the Olympics, mate,
[01:34:56.180 --> 01:34:58.260]   but you've got Stamps.com.
[01:34:58.260 --> 01:35:00.540]   Try it for you today.
[01:35:00.540 --> 01:35:02.820]   Use the offer code TWIT.
[01:35:02.820 --> 01:35:03.860]   According to Wikipedia,
[01:35:03.860 --> 01:35:06.300]   Caterpillar is the world's largest manufacturer
[01:35:06.300 --> 01:35:08.380]   of construction and mining equipment,
[01:35:08.380 --> 01:35:10.060]   diesel and natural gas engines
[01:35:10.060 --> 01:35:12.100]   and industrial gas turbines.
[01:35:12.100 --> 01:35:13.220]   Thank you.
[01:35:13.220 --> 01:35:15.860]   Chatham, Komatsu number two.
[01:35:15.860 --> 01:35:17.740]   Samsung not even on the list.
[01:35:17.740 --> 01:35:21.060]   So there.
[01:35:21.060 --> 01:35:22.140]   - That's how the whole thing started.
[01:35:22.140 --> 01:35:23.420]   Where's IKEA?
[01:35:23.420 --> 01:35:25.140]   - Where's IKEA on that list?
[01:35:25.140 --> 01:35:28.660]   Twice as big as Komatsu and Tonka,
[01:35:28.660 --> 01:35:31.780]   if you include the Tonka trucks would be number three.
[01:35:31.780 --> 01:35:37.020]   Phil says the biggest bull dust creator,
[01:35:37.020 --> 01:35:38.060]   John C. de Vorek.
[01:35:38.060 --> 01:35:42.460]   Moving on, AT&T did all right.
[01:35:42.460 --> 01:35:44.700]   We were talking earlier about their quarterly results,
[01:35:44.700 --> 01:35:47.340]   $3.9 billion profit.
[01:35:47.340 --> 01:35:50.060]   They sold 3.7 million iPhones.
[01:35:50.060 --> 01:35:53.620]   But as you said, that's not a big deal for them.
[01:35:53.620 --> 01:35:58.220]   Samsung Galaxy has three 10 million phones,
[01:35:58.220 --> 01:36:02.700]   but nevertheless, survey says the iPhone 5
[01:36:02.700 --> 01:36:06.580]   is still the most wanted phone.
[01:36:06.580 --> 01:36:10.220]   New survey from 451 research change wave,
[01:36:10.220 --> 01:36:13.100]   found that Apple's iPhone 5 or whatever it's called
[01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:16.380]   is seeing an unprecedented wave of advanced demand
[01:36:16.380 --> 01:36:19.020]   higher than any other iPhone model as I had before.
[01:36:19.020 --> 01:36:23.020]   14% of respondents were very likely to buy the iPhone 5.
[01:36:23.020 --> 01:36:26.300]   How many of you in the chat, in the audience
[01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:29.260]   are very likely to buy the next iPhone?
[01:36:29.260 --> 01:36:30.100]   14%.
[01:36:30.100 --> 01:36:30.940]   See that?
[01:36:30.940 --> 01:36:32.300]   It's exactly the same.
[01:36:32.300 --> 01:36:33.220]   Three hands.
[01:36:33.220 --> 01:36:37.180]   I don't know.
[01:36:37.180 --> 01:36:38.300]   I'm just a little worried.
[01:36:38.300 --> 01:36:39.220]   How about Google fiber?
[01:36:39.220 --> 01:36:40.220]   Who wants that?
[01:36:40.220 --> 01:36:41.060]   Show of hands.
[01:36:41.060 --> 01:36:41.900]   Yeah.
[01:36:41.900 --> 01:36:42.740]   100%.
[01:36:42.740 --> 01:36:46.420]   Did you see the details on Google fiber?
[01:36:46.420 --> 01:36:48.500]   Launched in Kansas City.
[01:36:48.500 --> 01:36:49.340]   I didn't realize this.
[01:36:49.340 --> 01:36:51.900]   It's a gigabit down, but also a gigabit up.
[01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:52.900]   Yep.
[01:36:52.900 --> 01:36:55.780]   It's a synchronous, not asynchronous.
[01:36:55.780 --> 01:36:58.460]   Wow.
[01:36:58.460 --> 01:37:00.460]   The way they're marketing it is really interesting.
[01:37:00.460 --> 01:37:03.220]   You don't necessarily can't get it in your neighborhood
[01:37:03.220 --> 01:37:05.060]   unless there's a critical mass of people
[01:37:05.060 --> 01:37:06.380]   who want it in your neighborhood.
[01:37:06.380 --> 01:37:08.060]   So go door to door.
[01:37:08.060 --> 01:37:08.900]   Right.
[01:37:08.900 --> 01:37:11.620]   And then you pay $300 to get it to your door.
[01:37:12.180 --> 01:37:13.860]   It's a $300 build out fee.
[01:37:13.860 --> 01:37:14.700]   Well, that's not bad.
[01:37:14.700 --> 01:37:16.260]   And then a minimum of 70 a month.
[01:37:16.260 --> 01:37:18.660]   And the television, what's in the television thing,
[01:37:18.660 --> 01:37:20.540]   a couple of people picked up on that,
[01:37:20.540 --> 01:37:23.700]   is that this puts Google is going to go into the cable TV.
[01:37:23.700 --> 01:37:24.540]   Right.
[01:37:24.540 --> 01:37:29.420]   They're going to offer competition to Comcast and AT&T Uverse
[01:37:29.420 --> 01:37:31.980]   and DirecTV using this system.
[01:37:31.980 --> 01:37:34.940]   And if it expands beyond Kansas City,
[01:37:34.940 --> 01:37:37.020]   they could be a national player at that.
[01:37:37.020 --> 01:37:42.660]   $120 a month, which is less than my-- I pay $150 a month
[01:37:42.660 --> 01:37:48.460]   for Comcast plus HBO's Showtime, Skinamax, and Stars.
[01:37:48.460 --> 01:37:53.020]   And then I get a super duper 20 megabit broadband.
[01:37:53.020 --> 01:37:54.140]   That's $150.
[01:37:54.140 --> 01:37:57.500]   For $30 less, I could get gigabit.
[01:37:57.500 --> 01:37:59.460]   Terabyte of storage on the internet.
[01:37:59.460 --> 01:38:02.220]   So your Google Drive, I guess, is now a terabyte.
[01:38:02.220 --> 01:38:03.420]   Free tablet.
[01:38:03.420 --> 01:38:07.540]   You get a Nexus 7, remote control,
[01:38:07.540 --> 01:38:09.580]   and you get major broadcast networks,
[01:38:09.580 --> 01:38:12.700]   hundreds of fiber channels on demand movies and shows,
[01:38:12.700 --> 01:38:14.500]   premium movie channels, and a dashional fee.
[01:38:14.500 --> 01:38:15.900]   So maybe it's about the same.
[01:38:15.900 --> 01:38:18.700]   But they are still trying to get the TV companies to sign up.
[01:38:18.700 --> 01:38:19.380]   Yeah.
[01:38:19.380 --> 01:38:21.900]   Yeah, they have to make those deals.
[01:38:21.900 --> 01:38:26.540]   Then there's a third-- so the $70 is gigabit only,
[01:38:26.540 --> 01:38:28.780]   still with a Google Drive terabyte.
[01:38:28.780 --> 01:38:33.180]   And then they're going to offer free internet
[01:38:33.180 --> 01:38:34.460]   with average speeds.
[01:38:34.460 --> 01:38:37.700]   5 megabits down and 1 megabit up is free.
[01:38:37.700 --> 01:38:39.380]   After you're paid for the build out, yeah.
[01:38:39.380 --> 01:38:42.340]   $300 build out, free for life.
[01:38:42.340 --> 01:38:46.780]   But there's one negative you have to live in Kansas City.
[01:38:46.780 --> 01:38:48.780]   No, nothing wrong with Kansas City.
[01:38:48.780 --> 01:38:49.780]   I just don't live there.
[01:38:49.780 --> 01:38:50.620]   Free for seven years.
[01:38:50.620 --> 01:38:51.140]   Oh, OK.
[01:38:51.140 --> 01:38:52.220]   Free for seven years?
[01:38:52.220 --> 01:38:53.220]   Yeah.
[01:38:53.220 --> 01:38:54.580]   [LAUGHS]
[01:38:54.580 --> 01:38:55.580]   I'm just--
[01:38:55.580 --> 01:38:56.700]   Is that what it says?
[01:38:56.700 --> 01:38:57.620]   Seven years free?
[01:38:57.620 --> 01:38:58.540]   Yeah.
[01:38:58.540 --> 01:39:02.060]   They guarantee it for the next seven years?
[01:39:02.060 --> 01:39:03.140]   That's an accounting thing.
[01:39:03.140 --> 01:39:04.100]   Isn't it seven years?
[01:39:04.100 --> 01:39:06.580]   It sounds like you broke a mirror,
[01:39:06.580 --> 01:39:08.580]   and you get seven years of bad internet.
[01:39:08.580 --> 01:39:10.660]   There's something.
[01:39:10.660 --> 01:39:12.580]   Google will deploy the fiber network in areas
[01:39:12.580 --> 01:39:15.900]   where there is the most interest first.
[01:39:15.900 --> 01:39:19.140]   They're calling each build out a rally.
[01:39:19.140 --> 01:39:22.060]   Kansas City residents can vote by paying a $10 fee
[01:39:22.060 --> 01:39:23.340]   to preregister.
[01:39:23.340 --> 01:39:25.540]   Then there's a fiberhood zone.
[01:39:25.540 --> 01:39:28.500]   I live in a fiberhood where a minimum number of users
[01:39:28.500 --> 01:39:30.660]   need to preregister in order to have them bring fiber
[01:39:30.660 --> 01:39:32.140]   to that neighborhood.
[01:39:32.140 --> 01:39:34.980]   Does it say what that minimum is?
[01:39:34.980 --> 01:39:37.020]   Maybe it doesn't this video.
[01:39:37.020 --> 01:39:39.780]   It'll be offering free gigabit connectivity to schools.
[01:39:39.780 --> 01:39:41.860]   That's good.
[01:39:41.860 --> 01:39:43.220]   Here's the video.
[01:39:43.220 --> 01:39:44.220]   Like we could play a little bit.
[01:39:44.220 --> 01:39:45.180]   Web is amazing.
[01:39:45.180 --> 01:39:46.180]   The web is amazing.
[01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:48.060]   But Americans don't have access to internet connections
[01:39:48.060 --> 01:39:50.980]   fast enough to showcase everything it has to offer.
[01:39:50.980 --> 01:39:52.900]   Your internet speed shouldn't be a bottleneck
[01:39:52.900 --> 01:39:55.780]   keeping you from accessing the best of the web,
[01:39:55.780 --> 01:39:58.220]   introducing Google fiber.
[01:39:58.220 --> 01:39:59.820]   You think this is a business for them?
[01:39:59.820 --> 01:40:01.260]   It's for what most Americans use today.
[01:40:01.260 --> 01:40:03.260]   Fiber's possibilities are unlimited.
[01:40:03.260 --> 01:40:03.980]   Is that the plan?
[01:40:03.980 --> 01:40:05.820]   Is this something the business they want to be in?
[01:40:05.820 --> 01:40:10.260]   Or are they just tweaking the telcos?
[01:40:10.260 --> 01:40:11.060]   Both.
[01:40:11.060 --> 01:40:11.860]   And Google.
[01:40:11.860 --> 01:40:12.340]   Both.
[01:40:12.340 --> 01:40:14.820]   Google wants to build fiber where people are most excited
[01:40:14.820 --> 01:40:15.540]   about it.
[01:40:15.540 --> 01:40:16.780]   Starting with Kansas City, they're
[01:40:16.780 --> 01:40:20.420]   creating fiberhoods and setting a goal of fiberhoods.
[01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:21.740]   We've got fiberhood here.
[01:40:21.740 --> 01:40:23.740]   It's a certain number of preregistration staff fibers.
[01:40:23.740 --> 01:40:25.060]   They didn't say certain number.
[01:40:25.060 --> 01:40:27.860]   If you live in Kansas City, preregister on the fiber website
[01:40:27.860 --> 01:40:30.140]   with a $10 fee by September 9th.
[01:40:30.140 --> 01:40:31.660]   Pre-registration matters.
[01:40:31.660 --> 01:40:34.100]   If your fiberhood doesn't reach its goal by September 9,
[01:40:34.100 --> 01:40:35.900]   you will be selected for installation.
[01:40:35.900 --> 01:40:37.780]   We've got a big red X on your fiberhood.
[01:40:37.780 --> 01:40:39.740]   Preregistration's get fiber first.
[01:40:39.740 --> 01:40:41.260]   So make sure you talk to your neighbors
[01:40:41.260 --> 01:40:43.460]   and get them to pre-register too.
[01:40:43.460 --> 01:40:46.740]   After September 9th, check out the fiber website.
[01:40:46.740 --> 01:40:48.220]   If your fiberhood is on the list,
[01:40:48.220 --> 01:40:50.060]   you'll be able to choose a Google fiber package
[01:40:50.060 --> 01:40:51.140]   and have it installed.
[01:40:51.140 --> 01:40:51.620]   Wow.
[01:40:51.620 --> 01:40:54.180]   When you pre-register, you're not only bringing fiber off
[01:40:54.180 --> 01:40:55.900]   the infrastructure into your home.
[01:40:55.900 --> 01:40:57.780]   You're helping to connect local schools,
[01:40:57.780 --> 01:41:00.740]   hospitals, and libraries free of charge.
[01:41:00.740 --> 01:41:02.300]   Let's do this for KC.
[01:41:02.300 --> 01:41:03.740]   Let's do this together.
[01:41:03.740 --> 01:41:07.620]   Welcome to the fiberhood.
[01:41:07.620 --> 01:41:11.180]   I'd pay $10 bucks, but you don't,
[01:41:11.180 --> 01:41:12.300]   I guess did you get that back?
[01:41:12.300 --> 01:41:13.620]   No, you don't get any money back.
[01:41:13.620 --> 01:41:15.540]   'Cause you just given Google $10 bucks.
[01:41:15.540 --> 01:41:19.100]   I believe it goes to your $300 installation fee.
[01:41:19.100 --> 01:41:21.980]   If you get the, if you're in the fiberhood.
[01:41:21.980 --> 01:41:23.380]   If you're in the fiberhood.
[01:41:23.380 --> 01:41:23.980]   Wow.
[01:41:25.540 --> 01:41:27.700]   And they do, it's supposedly they're gonna put this
[01:41:27.700 --> 01:41:28.660]   in other cities or no.
[01:41:28.660 --> 01:41:29.540]   What's the plan?
[01:41:29.540 --> 01:41:33.020]   They haven't said I don't think.
[01:41:33.020 --> 01:41:34.820]   If you live in a, if you live,
[01:41:34.820 --> 01:41:38.740]   if you live in a crappy neighborhood
[01:41:38.740 --> 01:41:41.300]   with a bunch of crack heads and homeless people
[01:41:41.300 --> 01:41:44.180]   as web 6275 does, you're screwed.
[01:41:44.180 --> 01:41:46.980]   You gotta live in an affluent neighborhood
[01:41:46.980 --> 01:41:48.100]   with lots of people.
[01:41:48.100 --> 01:41:51.300]   Fiberhood.
[01:41:51.300 --> 01:41:54.940]   Oh, and they waive the $300 fee
[01:41:54.940 --> 01:41:56.500]   if you sign up for the TV plan.
[01:41:56.500 --> 01:41:59.580]   Now Verizon stopped doing,
[01:41:59.580 --> 01:42:03.660]   Fios is, they're not putting Fios in any new places.
[01:42:03.660 --> 01:42:05.860]   In fact, Zevorak said this, he said,
[01:42:05.860 --> 01:42:08.380]   they're not, there's no plan to do fiber everywhere.
[01:42:08.380 --> 01:42:10.740]   This is just to get their, build a name,
[01:42:10.740 --> 01:42:12.220]   the reputation of Verizon up.
[01:42:12.220 --> 01:42:13.820]   They'll stop as soon as they can.
[01:42:13.820 --> 01:42:15.580]   And he was right, they did, they stopped.
[01:42:15.580 --> 01:42:16.940]   No, they could put in a lot more places
[01:42:16.940 --> 01:42:18.380]   than I think he thought.
[01:42:18.380 --> 01:42:21.740]   How do I get, how do I get to,
[01:42:21.740 --> 01:42:23.460]   I'm gonna move to a fiberhood.
[01:42:24.420 --> 01:42:26.460]   (laughs)
[01:42:26.460 --> 01:42:28.780]   Well, I think one of the statements that Google made
[01:42:28.780 --> 01:42:33.220]   was that they want to encourage the other ISPs
[01:42:33.220 --> 01:42:35.980]   and cable companies to innovate more, to do more.
[01:42:35.980 --> 01:42:37.540]   This is kind of a, to compete with this.
[01:42:37.540 --> 01:42:39.300]   I get to show the cost of the bow.
[01:42:39.300 --> 01:42:41.420]   To say you guys better get on it or we'll do it.
[01:42:41.420 --> 01:42:42.980]   How could you compete with this?
[01:42:42.980 --> 01:42:46.780]   Is this even a business model?
[01:42:46.780 --> 01:42:48.580]   Well, you know, in most big cities,
[01:42:48.580 --> 01:42:50.460]   there's a lot of what's called dark fiber.
[01:42:50.460 --> 01:42:52.740]   There's a lot of fiber that was put in the ground
[01:42:52.740 --> 01:42:57.740]   during the late 2000, early 2000s to mid 2000s
[01:42:57.740 --> 01:43:00.780]   and then the dot com bust happened and it never went anywhere.
[01:43:00.780 --> 01:43:02.860]   There's a bunch of it here in Houston.
[01:43:02.860 --> 01:43:05.580]   And some companies have kind of bought it up
[01:43:05.580 --> 01:43:06.740]   and are just sitting on it.
[01:43:06.740 --> 01:43:10.180]   And this is, I think what Google is thinking about.
[01:43:10.180 --> 01:43:11.260]   Use dark fiber.
[01:43:11.260 --> 01:43:12.100]   Yeah.
[01:43:12.100 --> 01:43:15.820]   Does Neil have to tell Liv in Kansas City?
[01:43:15.820 --> 01:43:19.740]   chatroom's saying he's gonna go door to door of the fridge.
[01:43:19.740 --> 01:43:21.900]   Says he's gonna go door to door to canvas his neighbors
[01:43:21.900 --> 01:43:22.940]   and get them all to.
[01:43:22.940 --> 01:43:24.300]   So I would do that.
[01:43:24.300 --> 01:43:25.980]   Hi, I'm your neighbor.
[01:43:25.980 --> 01:43:27.500]   You may recognize me.
[01:43:27.500 --> 01:43:29.260]   I was the guy streaking earlier.
[01:43:29.260 --> 01:43:34.260]   I would like to get you to sign up for Google fiber, please.
[01:43:34.260 --> 01:43:36.140]   Can I have $10?
[01:43:36.140 --> 01:43:37.140]   Can I have $10?
[01:43:37.140 --> 01:43:39.380]   (laughing)
[01:43:39.380 --> 01:43:44.740]   Padre S.J. says the Jesuit residence in Kansas City
[01:43:44.740 --> 01:43:45.580]   has already signed up.
[01:43:45.580 --> 01:43:47.420]   I guess we know where Padre will be broadcasting
[01:43:47.420 --> 01:43:50.380]   from starting next week on "Twiet."
[01:43:51.220 --> 01:43:53.460]   Wow, I want it.
[01:43:53.460 --> 01:44:00.100]   So, but seriously, is Comcast or Verizon,
[01:44:00.100 --> 01:44:01.220]   are they looking at this going,
[01:44:01.220 --> 01:44:03.540]   "Oh no, no, they're not."
[01:44:03.540 --> 01:44:04.380]   Are they?
[01:44:04.380 --> 01:44:07.780]   They're talking about it.
[01:44:07.780 --> 01:44:09.180]   Yeah, I know what they're saying.
[01:44:09.180 --> 01:44:12.260]   The CEO's saying, "Smithers, come here, can we do this?"
[01:44:12.260 --> 01:44:15.300]   No, sir, there's no financial viability for this whatsoever.
[01:44:15.300 --> 01:44:16.580]   Okay, thanks, see ya.
[01:44:16.580 --> 01:44:18.380]   (laughing)
[01:44:18.380 --> 01:44:20.300]   That's it, that's the talk.
[01:44:20.300 --> 01:44:22.300]   Of course, one would have hoped that if it goes well,
[01:44:22.300 --> 01:44:23.580]   one would hope that if it goes well,
[01:44:23.580 --> 01:44:26.700]   and if they actually, I mean, do make a big noise of it,
[01:44:26.700 --> 01:44:30.260]   if it succeeds, that that would get consumers,
[01:44:30.260 --> 01:44:33.540]   you know, to start complaining to their coronavirus.
[01:44:33.540 --> 01:44:36.100]   Like, oh, those guys in Kansas City have a gig of it.
[01:44:36.100 --> 01:44:37.780]   Why can't we?
[01:44:37.780 --> 01:44:38.780]   Yeah, maybe.
[01:44:38.780 --> 01:44:39.620]   I don't know.
[01:44:39.620 --> 01:44:41.780]   I mean, that's a, I'm actually curious
[01:44:41.780 --> 01:44:44.260]   about choosing Kansas City, too.
[01:44:44.260 --> 01:44:45.540]   Well, remember there was this campaign.
[01:44:45.540 --> 01:44:48.540]   In fact, I lobbied hard for the city of Petaluma.
[01:44:48.540 --> 01:44:52.260]   It would have transformed the twin business model
[01:44:52.260 --> 01:44:54.660]   if we had gigabit here.
[01:44:54.660 --> 01:44:57.300]   So it was good for business.
[01:44:57.300 --> 01:44:58.420]   And we didn't do it.
[01:44:58.420 --> 01:45:00.340]   I'm sorry, so did Kansas City lobby for it?
[01:45:00.340 --> 01:45:01.180]   I must have missed it.
[01:45:01.180 --> 01:45:02.020]   Oh, yeah, everybody did.
[01:45:02.020 --> 01:45:03.060]   There was a whole, yes, God, yeah.
[01:45:03.060 --> 01:45:05.140]   Was it Kansas City that renamed itself to Google?
[01:45:05.140 --> 01:45:05.980]   No, there was a town, though,
[01:45:05.980 --> 01:45:07.580]   that renamed itself to Google.
[01:45:07.580 --> 01:45:08.940]   They lost.
[01:45:08.940 --> 01:45:10.260]   I don't know what Kansas City did.
[01:45:10.260 --> 01:45:11.100]   Wow.
[01:45:11.100 --> 01:45:13.380]   If that didn't win, I don't know what Kansas City did.
[01:45:13.380 --> 01:45:14.220]   Okay.
[01:45:14.220 --> 01:45:16.380]   I'm having the feeling it has to do with hookers and champagne,
[01:45:16.380 --> 01:45:17.300]   but I don't know.
[01:45:18.300 --> 01:45:21.700]   The hardware consists of three small boxes,
[01:45:21.700 --> 01:45:23.420]   according to the Verge.
[01:45:23.420 --> 01:45:28.580]   Topeka changed its name to Kansas.
[01:45:28.580 --> 01:45:29.420]   Topeka was Topeka.
[01:45:29.420 --> 01:45:30.260]   Was Topeka.
[01:45:30.260 --> 01:45:31.100]   To Google Kansas.
[01:45:31.100 --> 01:45:31.940]   To Google Kansas.
[01:45:31.940 --> 01:45:32.780]   That didn't work.
[01:45:32.780 --> 01:45:34.980]   And then Google, I think, changed its name to Topeka briefly,
[01:45:34.980 --> 01:45:37.100]   just to kind of honor them back.
[01:45:37.100 --> 01:45:38.300]   That's kind of cute.
[01:45:38.300 --> 01:45:39.780]   But, and that wasn't enough.
[01:45:39.780 --> 01:45:41.020]   That's what I got to honor.
[01:45:41.020 --> 01:45:42.340]   I think there's other factors.
[01:45:42.340 --> 01:45:45.980]   How much dark fiber, for instance, would be a factor, wouldn't it?
[01:45:45.980 --> 01:45:47.900]   Topeka had permanently changed its name to Google.
[01:45:47.900 --> 01:45:50.260]   That might have been the first.
[01:45:50.260 --> 01:45:51.500]   They said, that's a stunt.
[01:45:51.500 --> 01:45:53.340]   We don't buy it.
[01:45:53.340 --> 01:45:56.820]   I like it that you get an X is seven tablet as a remote.
[01:45:56.820 --> 01:46:02.100]   That's almost kind of makes up for the 300 buck installation.
[01:46:02.100 --> 01:46:05.020]   Google Play will not be integrated initially,
[01:46:05.020 --> 01:46:07.380]   which I think is kind of interesting.
[01:46:07.380 --> 01:46:08.500]   You will have, oh, wow.
[01:46:08.500 --> 01:46:11.260]   Listen to this, you get a DVR that can record up to eight shows
[01:46:11.260 --> 01:46:14.540]   at once and save 500 hours of HD TV.
[01:46:14.540 --> 01:46:15.660]   Two terabytes.
[01:46:15.660 --> 01:46:17.980]   That's what the middle box is.
[01:46:17.980 --> 01:46:21.420]   So you get one box in the home that'll handle everything
[01:46:21.420 --> 01:46:22.340]   that's going on.
[01:46:22.340 --> 01:46:25.660]   The second box there is the two terabyte DVR.
[01:46:25.660 --> 01:46:28.220]   And then the third box is just a TV box.
[01:46:28.220 --> 01:46:31.180]   It's much smaller that you can hook your TV up to it.
[01:46:31.180 --> 01:46:32.180]   And is it Google TV?
[01:46:32.180 --> 01:46:32.780]   Is the interface?
[01:46:32.780 --> 01:46:34.260]   It must be.
[01:46:34.260 --> 01:46:38.380]   It looks a little like a Logitech review.
[01:46:38.380 --> 01:46:38.820]   Huh.
[01:46:38.820 --> 01:46:43.860]   So on that two terabyte hard drive, is that only your stuff?
[01:46:43.860 --> 01:46:48.020]   Or are they creating essentially a huge raid where everybody's
[01:46:48.020 --> 01:46:51.300]   data is on everybody else's box?
[01:46:51.300 --> 01:46:53.380]   I think it's just a conventional DVR.
[01:46:53.380 --> 01:46:53.900]   Look at that.
[01:46:53.900 --> 01:46:56.700]   It's a router.
[01:46:56.700 --> 01:46:57.140]   Mm.
[01:46:57.140 --> 01:46:58.180]   See, that's what I want.
[01:46:58.180 --> 01:47:05.020]   Is I want an ISP to do a distributed raid
[01:47:05.020 --> 01:47:08.700]   so that we can share everybody else's space.
[01:47:08.700 --> 01:47:11.460]   And for those people who don't need a lot,
[01:47:11.460 --> 01:47:14.020]   they essentially can contribute to the amount.
[01:47:14.020 --> 01:47:16.180]   Of course, you'd have to have a huge amount of privacy
[01:47:16.180 --> 01:47:17.100]   protections.
[01:47:17.100 --> 01:47:18.300]   But I think that that--
[01:47:18.300 --> 01:47:19.460]   Wouldn't that be cool though?
[01:47:19.460 --> 01:47:19.660]   Yeah.
[01:47:19.660 --> 01:47:22.260]   On a gigabit fiber network, you can do that.
[01:47:22.260 --> 01:47:23.100]   You could do that.
[01:47:23.100 --> 01:47:24.020]   Distributed computing.
[01:47:24.020 --> 01:47:25.020]   Mesh.
[01:47:25.020 --> 01:47:26.020]   Mm-hmm.
[01:47:26.020 --> 01:47:26.220]   Wow.
[01:47:26.220 --> 01:47:27.660]   That's really interesting.
[01:47:27.660 --> 01:47:29.660]   So much-- and I guess that's really Google's point,
[01:47:29.660 --> 01:47:31.500]   is everything changes when you get to that.
[01:47:31.500 --> 01:47:33.260]   I mean, the truth is nobody needs gigabit.
[01:47:33.260 --> 01:47:36.460]   That's so much faster than any website you're visiting.
[01:47:36.460 --> 01:47:39.340]   You're totally constrained by the server on the other end.
[01:47:39.340 --> 01:47:40.500]   And all the hops it's taking.
[01:47:40.500 --> 01:47:41.100]   Right.
[01:47:41.100 --> 01:47:42.900]   So really, all of the advantage comes to you
[01:47:42.900 --> 01:47:46.620]   from what the internet service provider is doing locally.
[01:47:46.620 --> 01:47:48.500]   That's where you're going to see the gigabit.
[01:47:48.500 --> 01:47:50.460]   So if they're doing movies, that's
[01:47:50.460 --> 01:47:52.700]   why you can do eight streams at once, things like that.
[01:47:52.700 --> 01:47:54.300]   Should be awfully cool though.
[01:47:54.300 --> 01:47:56.380]   I want it.
[01:47:56.380 --> 01:47:57.460]   Netflix on it.
[01:47:57.460 --> 01:48:04.180]   Well, did you see that consumer reports had a survey,
[01:48:04.180 --> 01:48:06.500]   a customer satisfaction survey--
[01:48:06.500 --> 01:48:09.020]   see, I think this is apples to apples,
[01:48:09.020 --> 01:48:11.940]   in which they rated Walmart's Voodoo service.
[01:48:11.940 --> 01:48:15.100]   I Apple's iTunes, Amazon's Instant and Prime offerings
[01:48:15.100 --> 01:48:17.140]   in Hulu against Netflix.
[01:48:17.140 --> 01:48:21.180]   And Netflix came in six out of eight,
[01:48:21.180 --> 01:48:23.300]   beating only video on demand channels in Hulu
[01:48:23.300 --> 01:48:25.580]   plus for streaming services.
[01:48:25.580 --> 01:48:35.180]   Disc Reynolds number one, beating Redbox Blockbuster.
[01:48:35.180 --> 01:48:36.300]   That's, of course, not exactly what
[01:48:36.300 --> 01:48:37.380]   Reed Hastings doesn't want to hear,
[01:48:37.380 --> 01:48:38.300]   since it's streaming.
[01:48:38.300 --> 01:48:40.220]   It's the future of Netflix.
[01:48:40.220 --> 01:48:45.700]   Anything else here?
[01:48:45.700 --> 01:48:51.300]   New York Times dropped its BlackBerry app.
[01:48:51.300 --> 01:48:53.180]   And its Palm pre-app.
[01:48:53.180 --> 01:48:55.460]   Well, that, I understand.
[01:48:55.460 --> 01:48:57.780]   I think there's still quite a few people who use the BlackBerry,
[01:48:57.780 --> 01:48:58.500]   but they must know.
[01:48:58.500 --> 01:48:59.860]   They must--
[01:48:59.860 --> 01:49:03.100]   Particularly in New York and the financial district.
[01:49:03.100 --> 01:49:05.460]   So I think that was really interesting.
[01:49:05.460 --> 01:49:06.300]   They must know.
[01:49:06.300 --> 01:49:08.980]   They must have the stats of how many people are using it, right?
[01:49:08.980 --> 01:49:09.460]   Right.
[01:49:09.460 --> 01:49:10.980]   Right.
[01:49:10.980 --> 01:49:13.420]   It's not worth it for them to continue to develop.
[01:49:13.420 --> 01:49:14.540]   That's a bad sign.
[01:49:14.540 --> 01:49:17.020]   That might be the worst sign I've heard yet for RIM.
[01:49:17.020 --> 01:49:20.460]   If you are in the financial capital of the world,
[01:49:20.460 --> 01:49:22.780]   where presumably a lot of people came BlackBerrys,
[01:49:22.780 --> 01:49:26.140]   and they're not reading the New York Times on it,
[01:49:26.140 --> 01:49:30.820]   that sounds like it's maybe not so good for BlackBerry.
[01:49:30.820 --> 01:49:33.380]   Not so good for Zynga either.
[01:49:33.380 --> 01:49:36.660]   Stock price tumbling.
[01:49:36.660 --> 01:49:41.140]   Their second quarter earnings fell short of analyst estimates.
[01:49:41.140 --> 01:49:42.820]   Always a bad idea.
[01:49:42.820 --> 01:49:46.140]   You always want to beat the estimate, right?
[01:49:46.140 --> 01:49:48.180]   How do you do that?
[01:49:48.180 --> 01:49:49.940]   How do you beat the estimates?
[01:49:49.940 --> 01:49:50.660]   Well, no.
[01:49:50.660 --> 01:49:52.740]   I mean, so--
[01:49:52.740 --> 01:49:55.660]   Do what you do what Apple does, which is your sandbag--
[01:49:55.660 --> 01:49:57.740]   Well, they should be on that one because last time.
[01:49:57.740 --> 01:49:59.020]   Yeah, it didn't work this time.
[01:49:59.020 --> 01:50:00.580]   But normally, see, I think Tim Cook
[01:50:00.580 --> 01:50:05.580]   doesn't quite have his hand around the throat
[01:50:05.580 --> 01:50:08.460]   of the financial analysts, like Steve Jobs did.
[01:50:08.460 --> 01:50:10.620]   But Steve would always say, oh, we're going to do terrible.
[01:50:10.620 --> 01:50:13.260]   It's going to be a horrible year.
[01:50:13.260 --> 01:50:16.060]   And then the panelists would downgrade.
[01:50:16.060 --> 01:50:16.420]   Right.
[01:50:16.420 --> 01:50:20.060]   They beat by a billion dollars or something like 48 cents a share,
[01:50:20.060 --> 01:50:20.500]   I think.
[01:50:20.500 --> 01:50:21.780]   And still, everybody was like, yeah,
[01:50:21.780 --> 01:50:25.460]   but it should have been like $5 billion and a buck 50 a share.
[01:50:25.460 --> 01:50:27.660]   I can't remember what the actual expectations were.
[01:50:27.660 --> 01:50:30.660]   But I mean, they actually-- they did well,
[01:50:30.660 --> 01:50:32.620]   but not as well as everyone expected.
[01:50:32.620 --> 01:50:34.500]   Are you talking about Zinga or Apple?
[01:50:34.500 --> 01:50:35.420]   I'm talking about Apple.
[01:50:35.420 --> 01:50:37.580]   Yeah, Zinga lost $22 million.
[01:50:37.580 --> 01:50:39.180]   Well, no, I'm not talking about that.
[01:50:39.180 --> 01:50:39.700]   Yeah.
[01:50:39.700 --> 01:50:40.180]   Yeah.
[01:50:40.180 --> 01:50:42.340]   But I mean, I don't-- I mean, you say don't disappoint the analysts.
[01:50:42.340 --> 01:50:44.620]   But even if you-- I mean--
[01:50:44.620 --> 01:50:46.140]   Is it--
[01:50:46.140 --> 01:50:48.300]   You're asking if you have control over that?
[01:50:48.300 --> 01:50:51.300]   Or no, you're saying, is it a good idea anyway?
[01:50:51.300 --> 01:50:54.700]   Well, no, the idea would be just be one or two cents
[01:50:54.700 --> 01:50:57.380]   above what the analysts predicted.
[01:50:57.380 --> 01:50:58.620]   Well, yeah, that'd be great.
[01:50:58.620 --> 01:50:58.820]   Yeah.
[01:50:58.820 --> 01:51:02.060]   The only problem is if you can't guide at all
[01:51:02.060 --> 01:51:03.220]   what the analysts are predicting--
[01:51:03.220 --> 01:51:05.460]   I mean, I was amazed to hear that Facebook actually--
[01:51:05.460 --> 01:51:06.900]   did it meet expectations?
[01:51:06.900 --> 01:51:08.180]   I mean, not analysts' expectations,
[01:51:08.180 --> 01:51:11.700]   but it made what it said it was going to make.
[01:51:11.700 --> 01:51:12.460]   Right.
[01:51:12.460 --> 01:51:14.380]   It met its guidance.
[01:51:14.380 --> 01:51:15.180]   Right.
[01:51:15.180 --> 01:51:16.340]   And then got hammered.
[01:51:16.340 --> 01:51:17.420]   Right.
[01:51:17.420 --> 01:51:17.860]   Because--
[01:51:17.860 --> 01:51:19.100]   I don't understand this stuff.
[01:51:19.100 --> 01:51:21.060]   You think I understand the stock market?
[01:51:21.060 --> 01:51:22.460]   Well, I was hoping somebody might be able to--
[01:51:22.460 --> 01:51:24.540]   Does anybody understand the stock market?
[01:51:24.540 --> 01:51:25.140]   Anybody.
[01:51:25.140 --> 01:51:27.140]   [SIGHS]
[01:51:27.140 --> 01:51:30.820]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[01:51:30.820 --> 01:51:31.580]   Come back with more.
[01:51:31.580 --> 01:51:32.340]   Great panel here.
[01:51:32.340 --> 01:51:34.580]   We've got-- do we have any more business to do?
[01:51:34.580 --> 01:51:35.820]   Which ad we did there the week ahead?
[01:51:35.820 --> 01:51:37.180]   We did the promo.
[01:51:37.180 --> 01:51:39.220]   I talked about my-- the fact that I'm going to do it
[01:51:39.220 --> 01:51:41.580]   and ask me anything on Reddit.
[01:51:41.580 --> 01:51:42.940]   We've got "Twiet" coming up.
[01:51:42.940 --> 01:51:45.060]   We've got a new show for iPhone lovers,
[01:51:45.060 --> 01:51:46.940]   i5 for the iPhone with Sarah Lane.
[01:51:46.940 --> 01:51:49.780]   That's Mondays right after "Twiet," right?
[01:51:49.780 --> 01:51:50.580]   Correct.
[01:51:50.580 --> 01:51:52.660]   So you really get a double hit there on Monday.
[01:51:52.660 --> 01:51:56.700]   At noon, "Twiet," and then like at 2 p.m.,
[01:51:56.700 --> 01:51:58.780]   Pacific 5 p.m., Eastern time.
[01:51:58.780 --> 01:52:00.020]   It's right before "Twiet."
[01:52:00.020 --> 01:52:03.540]   Before "Twiet," 11 a.m., right after "T."
[01:52:03.540 --> 01:52:07.020]   So Monday, TNT with the tech news at 10 a.m.,
[01:52:07.020 --> 01:52:09.820]   i5 for the iPhone 11 a.m., and then "Twiet" at noon.
[01:52:09.820 --> 01:52:11.540]   What a great lineup.
[01:52:11.540 --> 01:52:14.300]   That's "Must See Wednesday," "Thirst Mondays."
[01:52:14.300 --> 01:52:15.100]   Must see--
[01:52:15.100 --> 01:52:16.180]   It's a "Must See Week."
[01:52:16.180 --> 01:52:17.940]   Just tune in all the time.
[01:52:17.940 --> 01:52:20.980]   It's a "Must See Week."
[01:52:20.980 --> 01:52:22.700]   Our portion of this portion of this week
[01:52:22.700 --> 01:52:23.980]   in tech brought to you by Gazelle.
[01:52:23.980 --> 01:52:25.380]   Now, see if you are thinking--
[01:52:25.380 --> 01:52:28.580]   see if you're among the 14% thinking of buying that iPhone 5.
[01:52:28.580 --> 01:52:31.180]   Now would be a good time to find out what the old iPhone is
[01:52:31.180 --> 01:52:33.460]   worth so you can make a little moolah, a little cash
[01:52:33.460 --> 01:52:34.740]   on the side.
[01:52:34.740 --> 01:52:36.460]   Go to Gazelle.com.
[01:52:36.460 --> 01:52:37.420]   It's very easy now.
[01:52:37.420 --> 01:52:39.100]   They've simplified this, and I like it,
[01:52:39.100 --> 01:52:41.260]   because it turns out most of the people who
[01:52:41.260 --> 01:52:43.580]   were using Gazelle were selling these products--
[01:52:43.580 --> 01:52:46.380]   Apple stuff, iPhones, iPads, iPods, Apple TVs,
[01:52:46.380 --> 01:52:48.980]   desktops, laptops, displays.
[01:52:48.980 --> 01:52:51.300]   Here's some Blackberries.
[01:52:51.300 --> 01:52:56.580]   There's some Samsung Galaxy phones, HTC, Motorola, LG,
[01:52:56.580 --> 01:52:58.580]   Android phones, the Nokia.
[01:52:58.580 --> 01:53:01.140]   Just wondering what a Blackberry--
[01:53:01.140 --> 01:53:04.580]   and be getting a black-- let's see what a Blackberry be worth.
[01:53:04.580 --> 01:53:05.220]   Just curious.
[01:53:05.220 --> 01:53:08.100]   Blackberry, bold.
[01:53:08.100 --> 01:53:08.460]   Wow.
[01:53:08.460 --> 01:53:12.100]   So you can actually get money for-- let's say I got a torch.
[01:53:12.100 --> 01:53:15.500]   Perfect condition, because I used it for a minute.
[01:53:15.500 --> 01:53:17.380]   And let's just-- I'm just curious
[01:53:17.380 --> 01:53:18.620]   if I get any money for this thing.
[01:53:18.620 --> 01:53:20.460]   No water damage.
[01:53:20.460 --> 01:53:23.060]   Calculating your offer-- $100.
[01:53:23.060 --> 01:53:24.780]   And it's halfway towards a new iPhone.
[01:53:24.780 --> 01:53:26.420]   Let's see what else.
[01:53:26.420 --> 01:53:27.900]   That's good.
[01:53:27.900 --> 01:53:29.620]   Maybe you got the old iPhone, the 4S,
[01:53:29.620 --> 01:53:32.180]   and you want to say, hey, how much can I
[01:53:32.180 --> 01:53:33.580]   get towards an iPhone 5?
[01:53:33.580 --> 01:53:36.380]   Let's say I got a 32 gigabyte, $280.
[01:53:36.380 --> 01:53:40.660]   And good-- if it's in flawless condition, $300.
[01:53:40.660 --> 01:53:41.980]   I get a little profit.
[01:53:41.980 --> 01:53:43.420]   There's a profit deal here.
[01:53:43.420 --> 01:53:44.860]   Now, this is the cool thing.
[01:53:44.860 --> 01:53:47.460]   You can get a check mailed right to you, PayPal, of course,
[01:53:47.460 --> 01:53:50.140]   transfer, or-- and this is my recommendation--
[01:53:50.140 --> 01:53:51.180]   get the Amazon gift card.
[01:53:51.180 --> 01:53:54.340]   It's worth an extra 5%.
[01:53:54.340 --> 01:53:56.380]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com.
[01:53:56.380 --> 01:53:57.500]   Now, here's the really cool part.
[01:53:57.500 --> 01:53:59.340]   You can get this a quote for 30 days.
[01:53:59.340 --> 01:54:00.460]   It's good for 30 days.
[01:54:00.460 --> 01:54:01.660]   So I got to tell you, this phone is
[01:54:01.660 --> 01:54:04.340]   going to go down in value day after day after day after day.
[01:54:04.340 --> 01:54:07.940]   So lock in that price now.
[01:54:07.940 --> 01:54:09.020]   And it's good for 30 days.
[01:54:09.020 --> 01:54:11.940]   They pay the shipping on anything worth more than a buck.
[01:54:11.940 --> 01:54:13.540]   And they will, yeah, absolutely take
[01:54:13.540 --> 01:54:15.740]   broken or damaged stuff too.
[01:54:15.740 --> 01:54:20.100]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E, gazelle.com, the best way
[01:54:20.100 --> 01:54:22.060]   to trade in those old gadgets and get some cash
[01:54:22.060 --> 01:54:23.020]   for the new ones.
[01:54:23.020 --> 01:54:23.740]   Get this.
[01:54:23.740 --> 01:54:26.820]   Gazelle has paid almost $50 million
[01:54:26.820 --> 01:54:29.340]   to over 300,000 customers.
[01:54:29.340 --> 01:54:31.340]   Some very happy people.
[01:54:31.340 --> 01:54:32.340]   It's a really good service.
[01:54:32.340 --> 01:54:33.700]   We use it all the time here.
[01:54:33.700 --> 01:54:41.100]   Gazelle, G-A-Z-E-W-L-E.com.
[01:54:41.100 --> 01:54:43.380]   Resile the easy way.
[01:54:43.380 --> 01:54:44.020]   It says there.
[01:54:44.020 --> 01:54:47.380]   It should say recycle.
[01:54:47.380 --> 01:54:51.020]   It's a little point of order.
[01:54:51.020 --> 01:54:52.820]   Recycle.
[01:54:52.820 --> 01:54:54.340]   It is a kind of recycling.
[01:54:54.340 --> 01:54:55.420]   Somebody else will use it.
[01:54:55.420 --> 01:54:58.180]   In fact, oh, he just left.
[01:54:58.180 --> 01:54:59.180]   Cobblestone is here.
[01:54:59.180 --> 01:55:02.860]   He bought a gazelle, a galaxy too, from Gazelle.
[01:55:02.860 --> 01:55:03.380]   He's loving it.
[01:55:03.380 --> 01:55:11.020]   Oh, just a word to anybody at the London Olympics.
[01:55:11.020 --> 01:55:14.820]   Please do not tweet during the Olympics.
[01:55:14.820 --> 01:55:18.500]   Apparently, if you could avoid sending non-urgent text
[01:55:18.500 --> 01:55:21.500]   messages and tweets, the network will appreciate it.
[01:55:21.500 --> 01:55:25.060]   Apparently, overloaded network is affecting television coverage
[01:55:25.060 --> 01:55:31.420]   because commentators can't get information from the GPS
[01:55:31.420 --> 01:55:33.100]   satellite nav or anything.
[01:55:33.100 --> 01:55:34.820]   It's all broken because everybody's tweeting.
[01:55:34.820 --> 01:55:37.540]   And so, of course, what happened when they asked that a bunch
[01:55:37.540 --> 01:55:39.660]   of angry Brits tweeted it.
[01:55:40.300 --> 01:55:44.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:55:44.140 --> 01:55:47.260]   What do you mean we can't use Twitter?
[01:55:47.260 --> 01:55:49.820]   A network issue caused by hundreds of thousands of fans.
[01:55:49.820 --> 01:55:51.420]   They said this would be the Twitter Olympics.
[01:55:51.420 --> 01:55:52.340]   And it is.
[01:55:52.340 --> 01:55:54.500]   Hundreds of thousands of fans lined the street of London
[01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:56.620]   to cheer the British team on sending messages
[01:55:56.620 --> 01:55:57.140]   from their Twitter.
[01:55:57.140 --> 01:56:03.940]   He said the IOC spokesman said, if you could just spread it
[01:56:03.940 --> 01:56:06.140]   out a little bit.
[01:56:06.140 --> 01:56:07.780]   Of course, if you want to send something,
[01:56:07.780 --> 01:56:10.780]   we're not going to say, don't, you can't do it.
[01:56:10.780 --> 01:56:13.820]   It's just if it's not urgent, just please kind of take it easy.
[01:56:13.820 --> 01:56:15.740]   That was literally-- this is the quote.
[01:56:15.740 --> 01:56:19.540]   If it's not an urgent, urgent one, please kind of take it easy.
[01:56:19.540 --> 01:56:22.500]   We don't-- [LAUGHTER]
[01:56:22.500 --> 01:56:23.900]   That's kind of amazing.
[01:56:23.900 --> 01:56:26.540]   I can only imagine the strain of the network
[01:56:26.540 --> 01:56:27.420]   from all of that stuff.
[01:56:27.420 --> 01:56:31.940]   And YouTube, I guess, is doing a lot of this stuff.
[01:56:31.940 --> 01:56:36.700]   I did want to give credit to Nick built in for a good bits
[01:56:36.700 --> 01:56:38.700]   blog piece on Craigslist.
[01:56:38.700 --> 01:56:39.500]   Did you read this?
[01:56:39.500 --> 01:56:47.940]   Pointing out the Craigslist and has really transformed advertising
[01:56:47.940 --> 01:56:49.820]   and actually put some newspapers out of business
[01:56:49.820 --> 01:56:53.300]   by replacing their classified ads with the free Craigslist
[01:56:53.300 --> 01:56:57.420]   website, they've not been so friendly to people who
[01:56:57.420 --> 01:57:01.460]   want to aggregate or in some way take the information
[01:57:01.460 --> 01:57:04.660]   with Craigslist and make it more easy.
[01:57:04.660 --> 01:57:08.140]   They use, as a case in point, Eric Dementon, a 27-year-old
[01:57:08.140 --> 01:57:12.580]   programmer who built an application that placed
[01:57:12.580 --> 01:57:16.460]   Craigslist's apartment ads on an online map.
[01:57:16.460 --> 01:57:18.660]   So you look at the map, you say, I want that neighborhood,
[01:57:18.660 --> 01:57:19.820]   you can quickly find the listing.
[01:57:19.820 --> 01:57:21.140]   Something's Craigslist did not.
[01:57:21.140 --> 01:57:23.420]   So he made something he called Padmapper.
[01:57:23.420 --> 01:57:25.340]   There it is.
[01:57:25.340 --> 01:57:28.940]   Last week, Craigslist served him with a lawsuit claiming
[01:57:28.940 --> 01:57:32.900]   an infringement of copyright and trademark.
[01:57:32.900 --> 01:57:34.980]   But Dementon said, I'm kind of disappointed.
[01:57:34.980 --> 01:57:38.220]   I was always a great admirer of what Craigslist is doing.
[01:57:38.220 --> 01:57:39.780]   I'm just trying to help people save time.
[01:57:39.780 --> 01:57:46.100]   And in fact, lawyers say he's not violating any--
[01:57:46.100 --> 01:57:51.660]   there is no trademark or copyright on classified advertising.
[01:57:51.660 --> 01:57:53.380]   Furthermore, Craigslist said, oh, we only
[01:57:53.380 --> 01:57:55.860]   go after sites that heard our servers that use our bandwidth.
[01:57:55.860 --> 01:57:59.060]   And this Padmapper does not do that.
[01:57:59.060 --> 01:58:02.100]   Padmapper actually uses search results.
[01:58:02.100 --> 01:58:07.420]   It's not hitting Craigslist at all.
[01:58:07.420 --> 01:58:15.740]   They're using a service called Three Taps that goes to Google.
[01:58:15.740 --> 01:58:19.380]   They're using Google's bandwidth.
[01:58:19.380 --> 01:58:22.300]   So I think it's a provocative article.
[01:58:22.300 --> 01:58:25.180]   We actually tried to get Craig on this week in Google.
[01:58:25.180 --> 01:58:29.020]   And his people said that Mr. Newmark is not doing any.
[01:58:29.020 --> 01:58:30.020]   He said, I'm not doing any interviews.
[01:58:30.020 --> 01:58:32.260]   Now I think I understand why.
[01:58:32.260 --> 01:58:34.580]   I don't want to really talk about this.
[01:58:34.580 --> 01:58:37.100]   Good article, Nick, on that one.
[01:58:37.100 --> 01:58:39.260]   Any comment?
[01:58:39.260 --> 01:58:40.220]   Nothing to say?
[01:58:40.220 --> 01:58:44.740]   You're uncharacteristically silent.
[01:58:44.740 --> 01:58:46.660]   Well, I mean, Nick's interesting point
[01:58:46.660 --> 01:58:50.100]   is that Craig's list has said that they don't like these services
[01:58:50.100 --> 01:58:51.900]   because they hog bandwidth.
[01:58:51.900 --> 01:58:52.820]   Not the case, though.
[01:58:52.820 --> 01:58:54.060]   Not the case with this one.
[01:58:54.060 --> 01:58:55.500]   So there's some other--
[01:58:55.500 --> 01:58:58.220]   They don't like these services because people go to them.
[01:58:58.220 --> 01:59:00.420]   But it's funny because it doesn't hurt Craigslist.
[01:59:00.420 --> 01:59:03.420]   You still have to go through Craigslist to get the listing.
[01:59:03.420 --> 01:59:05.180]   Yeah, when you click on the item on the map,
[01:59:05.180 --> 01:59:07.500]   it takes you to a Craigslist item, doesn't it?
[01:59:07.500 --> 01:59:10.420]   Yeah, John C. de Vorax, son, created a--
[01:59:10.420 --> 01:59:12.140]   one of the things Craigslist does not
[01:59:12.140 --> 01:59:13.900]   do is search across geographic regions.
[01:59:13.900 --> 01:59:15.260]   You have to search your region.
[01:59:15.260 --> 01:59:18.660]   There are a hell of a lot of things that Craig's list does not do.
[01:59:18.660 --> 01:59:19.500]   And John's--
[01:59:19.500 --> 01:59:20.020]   It's a credit.
[01:59:20.020 --> 01:59:22.620]   --created something that would do that and also shut down
[01:59:22.620 --> 01:59:24.060]   by Craigslist.
[01:59:24.060 --> 01:59:25.980]   Does Craigslist have an API?
[01:59:25.980 --> 01:59:26.700]   No.
[01:59:26.700 --> 01:59:27.660]   You have to scrape the site.
[01:59:27.660 --> 01:59:29.380]   That's why.
[01:59:29.380 --> 01:59:33.420]   Well, and that may be their problem with a lot of companies
[01:59:33.420 --> 01:59:34.540]   don't want you scraping.
[01:59:34.540 --> 01:59:36.380]   Yeah, Craig's new work says, we take
[01:59:36.380 --> 01:59:39.460]   issue with only services which consume a lot of bandwidth,
[01:59:39.460 --> 01:59:43.620]   which I could understand, except that Padmapper doesn't.
[01:59:43.620 --> 01:59:47.420]   Craigslist has thrived for an awful long time by not changing
[01:59:47.420 --> 01:59:50.220]   and being almost the same as it was in 1985.
[01:59:50.220 --> 01:59:52.100]   And it's kind of worked for them.
[01:59:52.100 --> 01:59:53.940]   It's not clear where they'll work for them forever, though.
[01:59:53.940 --> 01:59:57.060]   And they don't quite say why they don't do an API.
[01:59:57.060 --> 01:59:59.540]   It seems like it could be a great thing.
[01:59:59.540 --> 02:00:00.740]   How do they make money?
[02:00:00.740 --> 02:00:01.580]   The listings are free.
[02:00:01.580 --> 02:00:02.060]   I don't use--
[02:00:02.060 --> 02:00:04.340]   A job listings cost money.
[02:00:04.340 --> 02:00:06.500]   Does it cost money to do an apartment listing?
[02:00:06.500 --> 02:00:07.940]   They make a lot of money off job listings.
[02:00:07.940 --> 02:00:10.260]   And there are no ads.
[02:00:10.260 --> 02:00:12.820]   This seems like this would be good, I don't understand.
[02:00:12.820 --> 02:00:14.300]   They used to charge for adult listings,
[02:00:14.300 --> 02:00:15.380]   but they don't do them anymore.
[02:00:15.380 --> 02:00:22.580]   So Nick says, why hasn't someone managed to unseat Craig's list,
[02:00:22.580 --> 02:00:25.340]   a site that has barely changed in close to two decades?
[02:00:25.340 --> 02:00:29.700]   Because he says it has dug an effective moat
[02:00:29.700 --> 02:00:33.140]   by cultivating an exaggerated image of doing good
[02:00:33.140 --> 02:00:35.700]   that keeps his customers loyal, while behind the scenes
[02:00:35.700 --> 02:00:39.260]   it bullies any rivals that come near and stifles innovation.
[02:00:39.260 --> 02:00:44.420]   I can't say I disagree.
[02:00:44.420 --> 02:00:46.300]   And Padmapper is still up, right?
[02:00:46.300 --> 02:00:47.380]   Even though it's being sued.
[02:00:47.380 --> 02:00:47.780]   Right.
[02:00:47.780 --> 02:00:50.100]   Still working.
[02:00:50.100 --> 02:00:51.020]   Now Craig is--
[02:00:51.020 --> 02:00:52.860]   I feel bad for--
[02:00:52.860 --> 02:00:54.420]   I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:00:54.420 --> 02:00:56.140]   Craig is very active on Twitter.
[02:00:56.140 --> 02:01:00.260]   And I wonder if he were to aim some questions at him on Twitter
[02:01:00.260 --> 02:01:01.860]   if he would respond to it there.
[02:01:01.860 --> 02:01:03.900]   Oh, no, that's too much like reporting.
[02:01:03.900 --> 02:01:05.300]   Craig is a good heart, but I don't
[02:01:05.300 --> 02:01:07.060]   understand this stuff.
[02:01:07.060 --> 02:01:07.980]   No, I like Craig.
[02:01:07.980 --> 02:01:09.020]   And maybe he's not Craig.
[02:01:09.020 --> 02:01:10.420]   Maybe he's Jim.
[02:01:10.420 --> 02:01:11.420]   The guy runs the crowd.
[02:01:11.420 --> 02:01:12.780]   Yeah, Craig is not the CEO of--
[02:01:12.780 --> 02:01:14.460]   Jim Buckmaster is the CEO of--
[02:01:14.460 --> 02:01:18.100]   Craig is just a tech support person.
[02:01:18.100 --> 02:01:19.180]   That's pretty funny.
[02:01:19.180 --> 02:01:19.980]   Really?
[02:01:19.980 --> 02:01:20.740]   He's the tech support.
[02:01:20.740 --> 02:01:21.420]   He does tech support.
[02:01:21.420 --> 02:01:22.780]   Yeah, he's doing customer service.
[02:01:22.780 --> 02:01:23.700]   He's a very sweet guy.
[02:01:23.700 --> 02:01:25.460]   I've interviewed him on Tech TV.
[02:01:25.460 --> 02:01:26.420]   We interviewed him quite a bit.
[02:01:26.420 --> 02:01:29.340]   He's a very sweet guy.
[02:01:29.340 --> 02:01:33.620]   Unfortunately, was it Nick Dementin,
[02:01:33.620 --> 02:01:37.980]   the guy who created Padmaster, says, he says,
[02:01:37.980 --> 02:01:40.780]   I'm going to keep it running, but I don't even have a lawyer.
[02:01:40.780 --> 02:01:43.460]   I don't know what I'm going to do.
[02:01:43.460 --> 02:01:44.780]   But he just-- he says, but I just--
[02:01:44.780 --> 02:01:45.820]   I think the site's useful.
[02:01:45.820 --> 02:01:48.700]   So I'm going to just keep it running and see what happens.
[02:01:48.700 --> 02:01:51.820]   We might have to do a Kickstarter for him.
[02:01:51.820 --> 02:01:55.220]   Can you do Kickstarter's for Legal Aid?
[02:01:55.220 --> 02:01:56.660]   I think you can do Kickstarter's for anything.
[02:01:56.660 --> 02:01:57.160]   Anything.
[02:01:57.160 --> 02:01:58.740]   As long as you want to keep it around.
[02:01:58.740 --> 02:02:00.180]   And if not, Indiegogo.
[02:02:00.180 --> 02:02:02.220]   Indiegogo.
[02:02:02.220 --> 02:02:02.820]   All right, guys.
[02:02:02.820 --> 02:02:05.020]   I thank you for your great service
[02:02:05.020 --> 02:02:09.300]   here in the service of Tech Knowledge Everywhere.
[02:02:09.300 --> 02:02:11.260]   Mr. Mac OS Ken.
[02:02:11.260 --> 02:02:12.500]   Ken Ray, great to have you.
[02:02:12.500 --> 02:02:19.580]   Macos Ken.com for your daily dose of Macintosh news.
[02:02:19.580 --> 02:02:21.900]   So no howls from Mountain Line users.
[02:02:21.900 --> 02:02:23.460]   That's good news.
[02:02:23.460 --> 02:02:25.220]   No, I had one person write to me and say
[02:02:25.220 --> 02:02:27.380]   that she hated it, but that was it.
[02:02:27.380 --> 02:02:29.860]   Even though she was like, I can't fault it for anything
[02:02:29.860 --> 02:02:30.420]   that happened.
[02:02:30.420 --> 02:02:31.940]   It's just it turns out I don't like it.
[02:02:31.940 --> 02:02:34.940]   I think the big issue is it's no different.
[02:02:34.940 --> 02:02:37.500]   It's so little different that it's like--
[02:02:37.500 --> 02:02:38.740]   what's the change?
[02:02:38.740 --> 02:02:41.580]   It's funny that Doc is not as shiny.
[02:02:41.580 --> 02:02:43.780]   And I'm really pissed off.
[02:02:43.780 --> 02:02:46.340]   Darn it, the Doc is not as shiny.
[02:02:46.340 --> 02:02:46.820]   Really?
[02:02:46.820 --> 02:02:49.700]   Oh, it is kind of a dim Doc.
[02:02:49.700 --> 02:02:51.060]   Well, that's the sidebar Doc.
[02:02:51.060 --> 02:02:53.300]   You need to put it down to the bottom.
[02:02:53.300 --> 02:02:55.740]   Oh, I have it at the bottom, and it's still not a show.
[02:02:55.740 --> 02:02:56.860]   The mine is on the left.
[02:02:56.860 --> 02:02:59.260]   Let's see if I put it on the bottom.
[02:02:59.260 --> 02:03:01.540]   Now I get the three-dimensional, but no, it's duller.
[02:03:01.540 --> 02:03:03.660]   I now looks like it's sitting on a--
[02:03:03.660 --> 02:03:04.940]   It's like brushed aluminum.
[02:03:04.940 --> 02:03:06.420]   Ooh.
[02:03:06.420 --> 02:03:07.540]   What is that made out of?
[02:03:07.540 --> 02:03:10.740]   No, it looks like Formica.
[02:03:10.740 --> 02:03:13.220]   It's on a Formica Doc.
[02:03:13.220 --> 02:03:16.020]   That's weird.
[02:03:16.020 --> 02:03:20.540]   It's like that plastic, that shiny plastic they put in cars.
[02:03:20.540 --> 02:03:21.940]   Foe leather.
[02:03:21.940 --> 02:03:22.540]   Foe leather.
[02:03:22.540 --> 02:03:23.140]   Foe leather.
[02:03:23.140 --> 02:03:25.380]   It's Corinthian leather.
[02:03:25.380 --> 02:03:28.540]   Mr. Dwight Silverman is at the Houston Chronicle blog,
[02:03:28.540 --> 02:03:32.620]   blogs.cron.com/techblog.
[02:03:32.620 --> 02:03:37.780]   And also does a great weekly show on Pacifica Radio there
[02:03:37.780 --> 02:03:42.060]   in Houston on Wednesdays called Technology Bites.
[02:03:42.060 --> 02:03:47.340]   You can hear it, we stream it at 8 o'clock central on kpft.org.
[02:03:47.340 --> 02:03:51.220]   And this week, we'll hear tales of DEFCON
[02:03:51.220 --> 02:03:53.700]   when our one of my three of my colleagues returned.
[02:03:53.700 --> 02:03:56.460]   Oh, they were from the Technology Bites colleagues,
[02:03:56.460 --> 02:03:59.660]   not the Houston Chronicle.
[02:03:59.660 --> 02:04:05.460]   Jay Lee, our colleague, Flicted, and Barrett Cannon all
[02:04:05.460 --> 02:04:05.780]   went out.
[02:04:05.780 --> 02:04:08.580]   I'm not going to say which one got his Twitter account hacked.
[02:04:08.580 --> 02:04:09.740]   Oh, it's obviously Flicted.
[02:04:09.740 --> 02:04:11.460]   Anybody named Flicted, that's obvious.
[02:04:11.460 --> 02:04:12.460]   No, no, no.
[02:04:12.460 --> 02:04:14.820]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:04:14.820 --> 02:04:16.740]   Flicted is an awesome guy.
[02:04:16.740 --> 02:04:21.300]   And he also is probably the most paranoid of three.
[02:04:21.300 --> 02:04:23.060]   So I don't think it was him.
[02:04:23.060 --> 02:04:24.780]   Ah, OK.
[02:04:24.780 --> 02:04:26.300]   Cool.
[02:04:26.300 --> 02:04:27.100]   Thank you, Dwight.
[02:04:27.100 --> 02:04:27.900]   Great to have you, as always.
[02:04:27.900 --> 02:04:29.060]   Thank you.
[02:04:29.060 --> 02:04:31.340]   The Technologizer, Harry McCracken.
[02:04:31.340 --> 02:04:34.300]   You can read him on time.com, which I have been doing religiously.
[02:04:34.300 --> 02:04:34.940]   It's awesome.
[02:04:34.940 --> 02:04:35.660]   Thank you.
[02:04:35.660 --> 02:04:38.580]   And also, Technologizer.com.
[02:04:38.580 --> 02:04:39.260]   Thanks for being here.
[02:04:39.260 --> 02:04:40.020]   We appreciate it.
[02:04:40.020 --> 02:04:40.780]   My pleasure, Leon.
[02:04:40.780 --> 02:04:41.900]   Thank you all for joining us.
[02:04:41.900 --> 02:04:44.020]   Twitter is every Sunday, 3 p.m.
[02:04:44.020 --> 02:04:46.700]   Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time.
[02:04:46.700 --> 02:04:48.020]   2,200 UTC.
[02:04:48.020 --> 02:04:48.820]   You can watch live.
[02:04:48.820 --> 02:04:51.540]   But if you can't watch live, it is nice.
[02:04:51.540 --> 02:04:53.860]   Because I think if we do some more of those straw polls,
[02:04:53.860 --> 02:04:55.460]   that will be nice to have that live on it.
[02:04:55.460 --> 02:04:57.500]   Should I check that one more time?
[02:04:57.500 --> 02:05:01.300]   Just to see how the final vote straw,
[02:05:01.300 --> 02:05:04.940]   poll.me/933.
[02:05:04.940 --> 02:05:08.220]   And the final vote, iPhone's ecosystem,
[02:05:08.220 --> 02:05:11.020]   or Android's free apps.
[02:05:11.020 --> 02:05:14.180]   And the final-- oh, let's go to results.
[02:05:14.180 --> 02:05:16.380]   Yeah, it does only let you vote once.
[02:05:16.380 --> 02:05:17.300]   Boy, neck and neck.
[02:05:17.300 --> 02:05:24.180]   46% Android, 45% iPhone, 5% Windows, 3% BlackBerry,
[02:05:24.180 --> 02:05:25.180]   almost 1,000 votes.
[02:05:25.180 --> 02:05:27.060]   I bet we'll have 1,000 votes before I wrap this up.
[02:05:27.060 --> 02:05:28.940]   I wish you could embed this.
[02:05:28.940 --> 02:05:31.900]   I would love to use this on Tech Blog.
[02:05:31.900 --> 02:05:32.700]   I wish this was in--
[02:05:32.700 --> 02:05:33.940]   Is that awesome?
[02:05:33.940 --> 02:05:34.620]   Yeah.
[02:05:34.620 --> 02:05:36.380]   Well, talk to the creator.
[02:05:36.380 --> 02:05:37.420]   Hey, Chad, let's remind me.
[02:05:37.420 --> 02:05:38.740]   We'll do this on a regular basis.
[02:05:38.740 --> 02:05:39.740]   I love this.
[02:05:39.740 --> 02:05:40.220]   Yeah.
[02:05:40.220 --> 02:05:41.020]   I think it's great.
[02:05:41.020 --> 02:05:42.460]   We can have a poll at the beginning of every show.
[02:05:42.460 --> 02:05:44.300]   Thank you, Dan Dierks.
[02:05:44.300 --> 02:05:46.060]   Really nice job.
[02:05:46.060 --> 02:05:46.460]   Yeah.
[02:05:46.460 --> 02:05:47.460]   Really nice.
[02:05:47.460 --> 02:05:47.860]   And Dan--
[02:05:47.860 --> 02:05:50.940]   And we haven't-- I mean, we at Twit just put it through the ringer,
[02:05:50.940 --> 02:05:51.940]   and it didn't break.
[02:05:51.940 --> 02:05:53.140]   No.
[02:05:53.140 --> 02:05:56.660]   That's a lot of votes in a few minutes.
[02:05:56.660 --> 02:05:58.060]   He's a good programmer.
[02:05:58.060 --> 02:05:59.300]   Dan Dierks, thank you.
[02:05:59.300 --> 02:06:05.500]   If you don't get to see alive, you could still vote,
[02:06:05.500 --> 02:06:07.260]   but it probably wouldn't matter.
[02:06:07.260 --> 02:06:09.500]   And you can always get the on-demand versions.
[02:06:09.500 --> 02:06:13.300]   We've got audio and video available at Twit.tv.
[02:06:13.300 --> 02:06:14.020]   We appreciate it.
[02:06:14.020 --> 02:06:15.140]   Thanks for being here.
[02:06:15.140 --> 02:06:16.620]   And the next time I'll-- that's what I'll do.
[02:06:16.620 --> 02:06:18.660]   I'll chirp the URL.
[02:06:18.660 --> 02:06:20.300]   That would be long, full circle.
[02:06:20.300 --> 02:06:21.060]   That would be perfect.
[02:06:21.060 --> 02:06:22.100]   Long, full circle.
[02:06:22.100 --> 02:06:22.780]   Thanks for being here.
[02:06:22.780 --> 02:06:23.540]   We'll see you next week.
[02:06:23.540 --> 02:06:25.340]   Another Twit is in the can.
[02:06:25.340 --> 02:06:27.940]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:06:27.940 --> 02:06:32.780]   Maybe it runs on Squarespace.
[02:06:32.780 --> 02:06:34.300]   Maybe that's why it never breaks.
[02:06:34.300 --> 02:06:36.180]   Do in the Twit, baby.
[02:06:36.180 --> 02:06:37.020]   Do in the Twit.
[02:06:37.020 --> 02:06:38.020]   All right.
[02:06:38.020 --> 02:06:39.940]   Do in the Twit, baby.
[02:06:39.940 --> 02:06:40.740]   Do in the Twit.
[02:06:40.740 --> 02:06:41.740]   All right.
[02:06:41.740 --> 02:06:43.620]   Do in the Twit, baby.
[02:06:43.620 --> 02:06:44.420]   Do in the Twit.
[02:06:44.420 --> 02:06:46.180]   All right.
[02:06:46.180 --> 02:06:49.740]   Olympics fans, please do not tweet unless you have to.
[02:06:49.740 --> 02:06:55.140]   Whoa.
[02:06:55.140 --> 02:06:56.900]   What was that?
[02:06:56.900 --> 02:06:59.260]   Forbirigmas.
[02:06:59.260 --> 02:07:00.700]   Did a big truck just go by?
[02:07:00.700 --> 02:07:01.200]   Sorry.
[02:07:01.200 --> 02:07:02.180]   Eat a burrito today.
[02:07:02.180 --> 02:07:04.740]   Cheese Louise sounds like elephants.
[02:07:04.740 --> 02:07:06.780]   That might have been here.
[02:07:06.780 --> 02:07:07.580]   Sorry.
[02:07:07.580 --> 02:07:08.740]   Where are you, Kenrae?
[02:07:08.740 --> 02:07:11.900]   Are you in-- oh, you live under the overpass.
[02:07:11.900 --> 02:07:12.420]   I know.
[02:07:12.420 --> 02:07:13.020]   I'm at home.
[02:07:13.020 --> 02:07:14.780]   It's just--
[02:07:14.780 --> 02:07:17.340]   I thought I had-- if you give me a minute,
[02:07:17.340 --> 02:07:19.060]   I can actually go close one more window.
[02:07:19.060 --> 02:07:19.820]   That's fine.
[02:07:19.820 --> 02:07:21.420]   That's fine.
[02:07:21.420 --> 02:07:23.140]   Must well, do you think it's going to happen a lot?
[02:07:23.140 --> 02:07:24.900]   I don't mind it once in a while.
[02:07:24.900 --> 02:07:26.660]   I mean, it's my street.
[02:07:26.660 --> 02:07:27.620]   It's just outside.
[02:07:27.620 --> 02:07:29.140]   No, we live on a residential street.
[02:07:29.140 --> 02:07:31.500]   So somebody has a Camaro.
[02:07:31.500 --> 02:07:34.860]   It's a [BLEEP] Camaro Leo.
[02:07:34.860 --> 02:07:35.820]   That's not a Camaro.
[02:07:35.820 --> 02:07:37.860]   That's an el Camino.
