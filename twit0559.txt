[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.880]   We've gathered together to chat.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.880]   There's so much to talk about joining us.

[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:16.880]   How's it going?
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.880]   Thanks for joining us at Strange Ways on the Twitter.

[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.880]   Welcome, film girl, on the Twitter.
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:33.880]   And from iMoor.com, I'm going to say Renee Richie.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.880]   It's a habit, is what it is.
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.880]   That's a frequent thing.
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:38.880]   It's a frequent thing.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.880]   It's serenity.
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:40.880]   I'm not Renee.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.880]   Of course.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.880]   No, Ren with Guller.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:43.880]   Yes.
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.880]   Hello, Leo.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.280]   I haven't seen you since you did that incredible review of the Apple Pencil drawn entirely in iPad
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.280]   Pro.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.280]   That was Marvy.
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.280]   So good.
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.280]   It was fun.
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.280]   It was really fun to do.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.280]   I want to see more of those.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.280]   God.
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.280]   You win a bunch of other people.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.280]   You're going to get me to just do cartoons.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.280]   It's terrible.
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.280]   It's a new future.
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.280]   Not a cartoonist.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.280]   Not.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.280]   I just like doodling.
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.280]   Yeah, well, it was good.
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.280]   Your doodle of you is really good.
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.280]   I feel like that might have been something you practiced in seventh grade.
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.280]   Yeah, I mean, I've had like 12, 14 years of practice on that.
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.280]   It's getting there.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.280]   Some people practice their married name.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.280]   You are practicing your serenity doodle.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.280]   My quick doodle.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.280]   I mean, it is my Twitter avatar.
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.280]   Right.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.280]   Yeah, you got to get it down.
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.080]   And Christina, congratulations on surviving the layoffs at Mashable.
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.080]   I was so relieved when I saw that you're still there.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.280]   But your beat is really exactly what the new Mashable wants to do, right?
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.720]   I mean, it's been an interesting couple of weeks, but yeah, that that's focusing on
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.720]   on tech and entertainment and culture is kind of the new.
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.720]   Yeah.
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.320]   I mean, that's you.
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.320]   That's what you do.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.840]   You are film girl.
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.320]   Although I was very jealous because when Apple announced on Tuesday a new MacBook, I thought,
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.320]   Oh, great.
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.120]   How quickly can we get it so we could review it?
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.000]   Well, immediately on the Twitter and everywhere else.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.880]   And of course, on Mashable benchmarks from Christina Warren.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:11.880]   Nice.
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.120]   You got a day in date.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.120]   Yeah.
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.120]   Yeah.
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.120]   And I was meeting with them.
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.520]   They announced it and I had a meeting with them a little bit later that morning.
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.640]   And so it was one of those things where we had like the news post up and I had a meeting
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.640]   and scheduled for the week.
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.640]   How do they do that?
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.040]   Do they say Christina, we like you so much.
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.840]   We've got a little something for you.
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.760]   And they call it.
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:31.760]   It sort of depends.
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:32.760]   Yeah.
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:33.760]   Yeah.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:34.760]   I mean, this was the case.
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:35.760]   You know, you set something up, but you know, they'd reach out.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.760]   It's a briefing.
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.760]   It's a briefing.
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:38.760]   Yeah.
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:39.760]   And so I went with Lance.
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:45.040]   Lance and I were both briefed and he received one in space gray and I received one in space
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.040]   and I was in Rose gold.
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.520]   Oh, they gave you the pink one.
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.520]   That is so sexist.
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.920]   No, it's not.
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:54.320]   It's not sexist because if anybody follows me on Twitter or Mashable or Instagram or
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.320]   anywhere else, you know, I'm obsessed with Rose gold.
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.320]   Yeah.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.640]   So it's not sexist is actually just paying attention.
[00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:59.640]   It would be sex.
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:00.640]   Christina is exactly.
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:07.480]   It would be sexist if I haven't been on record like four months of being obsessed with everything
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.640]   Rose gold.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.120]   That's true.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.240]   And actually Renee Richie posted on Twitter his complete collection.
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.240]   He has the full set.
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.240]   All that he does.
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.240]   He has the full set.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.240]   I asked you to.
[00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.720]   I do as well, but I don't.
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.760]   The watch, I don't even know where it is because that's it is a review and it's probably Mashable
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.040]   draw someplace.
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:30.520]   So yeah, so I loved his whole collection, but I was like, yep, that's.
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.520]   Yep.
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:37.600]   It's a thing that in my case, I bought most of I mean, other than the new Mac book, everything
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.160]   I own this in Rose gold, I've actually purchased.
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:45.040]   Well, you'll be happy to know that the one I bought for Lisa is Rose gold.
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.040]   Good man.
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.400]   And the reason is we have the gold Mac books from last year.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.440]   And it was always a problem because our Mac books are identical.
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.840]   So I want her to have and I'm not going to get the new Mac book.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:02.520]   I actually incurred the wrath of a few Apple fans when I said, I think I'm going to get
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.320]   the HP Spectre instead and then compare them because this is the one that really is a clone
[00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:09.240]   of the Mac book, right?
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.240]   Complete clone.
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:18.680]   I mean, it's a little bit thinner, but it is heavier, but it has three USB ports and they're
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:19.680]   all Thunderbolt three.
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.280]   So it's, I mean, it looks great.
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.280]   Right.
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:28.320]   Apparently it's made of liquid chocolate, at least from the video that they show of melting
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.080]   chocolate or something.
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.080]   I guess that's the copper.
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.800]   It's a very appily add.
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.760]   But you know, they bested Apple in some respects.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:40.400]   It has a lower res screen, but it does have, it has this full skylight processors, not
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.400]   the M processors.
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.320]   Yeah, they're not the M to the skylake.
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:47.080]   And yeah, I think the big thing obviously for me is that the Thunderbolt three and the
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.800]   three USB C ports.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.240]   So funny thing is it's thinner on the edges.
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.440]   It's fatter in the middle.
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:58.400]   It's just like Apple's stuff where it's bowed, you know, and the bulge in the middle is points,
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.760]   I think point six, I don't know, somebody put it up on the chat room point.
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.760]   There it is.
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:03.760]   There's the melting, whatever that is.
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.760]   It looks like chocolate.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.760]   I don't know whether this does look like chocolate.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.080]   I think it's supposed to be a honeycomb pattern.
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.080]   Yeah.
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.120]   Is there a honeycomb pattern on the laptop?
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.800]   No, and there's an on the Eames chair on the laptop either.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:16.800]   It's just no.
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.600]   It's an Eames chair for them to like see, look, look, look, we care about design.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.600]   Design.
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.600]   Design.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.400]   This is nothing to do with us at all.
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.920]   We just want to look relevant in the design space.
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.960]   Well, they're taking a page at Apple's book.
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:30.960]   Let's face it.
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:31.960]   Oh, totally.
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.000]   I think that old HP logo that I like the new logo.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   That's all.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.400]   Well, it was originally part of, I think, like a 2011 brand redesign.
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.600]   The Verge had an article about it, but I remember seeing it.
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.000]   It's like five years ago.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:50.840]   Remember when they were like, we're killing Wubles and we're getting out of PCs.
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:52.800]   And everybody was like, oh my God.
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:57.440]   At like that same time they announced or it was leaked, a new identity thing.
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.440]   And that's what this was.
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:59.440]   So I like it.
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.200]   I think it's actually a great, great logo.
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:06.320]   If they split up now, the HP has, the split is done.
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.240]   The split is done.
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.960]   So there's the PC division.
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:13.240]   Did the printer division go with the PC division?
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.240]   Pretty sure it did.
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.240]   Yes.
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:19.200]   And then there's the enterprise services, a hardware division.
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:20.200]   Right.
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.200]   Okay.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:22.200]   Right.
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.200]   That actually kind of makes sense.
[00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:28.840]   You know, the merger with Compaq is famously referred to along with the AOL Time Warner merger
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:29.840]   as well.
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:30.840]   The worst mergers of all time.
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:31.840]   Thank you.
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.440]   Hopefully it was, I mean, it's always on those lists.
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.880]   I mean, when, when, when Carly Fiorina was trying to run for president, it was one of
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:42.480]   those things where, you know, she's like, look at what I did at HP in and we're all
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.560]   just, I mean, I was in high school and that happened.
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.240]   And I was like, I was in high school and I'm going, you really don't want to run on that.
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.240]   That's really not a good idea.
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.240]   Yeah.
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.240]   It was not a good idea.
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:56.760]   But then it was followed by a number of articles that many of which said, don't mention
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:57.760]   this, Carly.
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.240]   And a few said she wasn't all that bad.
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:02.600]   You can't really blame her for what was happening to HP.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:06.840]   I mean, it has not, I mean, and certainly since she's departed, she is so struggling.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:07.840]   Well, no, she didn't dare to start her.
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.280]   She was not the worst CEO that ever had.
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:13.000]   That would be the German guy at LEO Apotheca.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.320]   Because you literally spent $10 billion on magic beans.
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:18.320]   Right.
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.320]   You bought a company called Autonomy.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.320]   Right.
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.360]   They did nothing that they had to write off almost the entire purchase of and was like,
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.480]   I bet the future of the company on this.
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.480]   And it's like.
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.520]   So that's what she inherited.
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:28.520]   You can't.
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.360]   No, no, no, no, no, Carly Fiorina inherit.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.360]   Now it's all confusing.
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.360]   Wasn't it Carly Fiorina?
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.600]   No, Meg Whitman inherited that.
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.600]   Nick Whitman.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.800]   No, came in in '99, 2000.
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:39.800]   Right.
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.600]   She was the one who kind of got them into trouble to begin with.
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.600]   Bot Compact.
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:43.600]   Then Mark Hur took over.
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.600]   Right.
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:47.400]   Then he had his whole inappropriate scenario thing.
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.400]   And now he's coast to you of Oracle.
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:50.400]   So he did fine for himself.
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.400]   Yes.
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:52.400]   Yes.
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.680]   It was very famous Larry Ellison said, what are they crazy firing him?
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:54.680]   He's the best ever.
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:55.680]   I'm hiring him.
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.280]   He's a smart guy.
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:03.160]   And then the Leo Prothicker took over HP, $10 billion in magic beans.
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.640]   And then Meg Whitman was like, are you serious?
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:06.640]   This is what I'm coming into.
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.360]   Well, what kind of crazy corporate governance?
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.560]   I mean, where does the board win all of this is happening?
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:14.240]   Oh, well, the board that's famous was the most dysfunctional board probably in modern
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:15.240]   corporate history.
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.240]   Ray Lane, the whole thing.
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.160]   They were spying on each other.
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.160]   They were--
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.920]   Well, remember when-- and this was, I think, under Carly window, they spy on the CNET
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:25.200]   reporters when they, like, hacked their email.
[00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.200]   Remember that?
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.200]   Crazy.
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:28.200]   Just crazy.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.200]   This is anyway.
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.200]   We're never--
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.200]   New company.
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.200]   It's a nude company.
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.000]   And, you know, I had sworn for years I'll never buy an HP computer because they used
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.960]   to be really junked up with every possible form of trial where.
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:41.600]   But I thought this is a pretty computer.
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.360]   So I'll give them one more chance.
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:46.600]   And it is, in a way, it's a new company, isn't it?
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.600]   Oh, totally.
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.480]   Of course, I'm going to immediately put Linux on it because I can't bear wearing running
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.480]   windows.
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:52.680]   What, this is true.
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:56.920]   Oh, now you're asking the geeky question, huh?
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:57.920]   Now?
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:58.920]   Now?
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.920]   Whatever distro-- whatever distro will work, actually, because--
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:02.920]   That's a good call.
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:03.920]   Like, whatever will--
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:07.840]   Yeah, because I-- it's probably all highly proprietary hardware that nothing supports.
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:08.840]   That's the question.
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.360]   You know, a bunch-- I have to say it for a long time.
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.960]   Pardon us while we talk, you guys.
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:15.080]   Just to leap in any time you want to--
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.400]   Anytime, sorry, guys.
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.960]   Kristina, I don't get to talk.
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:18.960]   Nerds.
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:19.960]   Nerds.
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.520]   I've been joining the Linux talk.
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:22.520]   I haven't heard Linux talk.
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:25.200]   Well, I'll tell you why.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.200]   It's the year of the desktop Linux.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:28.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.200]   Oh, no.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.680]   You can't even finish that set.
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.120]   I can't even finish the year of the desktop Linux.
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.120]   Linux is not--
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.920]   We are using it all the time on Android.
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.520]   Not we all, a few of you refuse.
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:41.320]   But Chrome OS is Linux.
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.640]   But the reason-- a couple of things.
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:49.360]   First of all, I can't-- what Microsoft has done with Windows 10, I find so offensive
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:52.080]   that on principle, I think it's a fine operating system.
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.120]   By the way, I'm not complaining about it.
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:58.680]   But on principle, because of them forcing it on people, which they continue to do,
[00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:01.560]   unrepentantly, people call me all the time.
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:05.200]   I mean, today on the radio show, woke up, Windows 10's on his computer.
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:07.000]   He didn't ask for it.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   But they're doing that.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.560]   They said they would do it, and they're doing it.
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:14.000]   And I think that's so unacceptable that just as a protest--
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.520]   And I do have a Microsoft Surface book.
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.960]   I guess I'll leave that with Windows.
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.240]   But I just don't want to buy another Windows PC.
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.200]   On the other hand, this is beautiful hardware.
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.560]   If I could put Mac OS, I would.
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:26.920]   By the way, that's the new name, by the way.
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:27.920]   Isn't it?
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:29.400]   Mac OS, we decided it's not going to be OS 10.
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:30.400]   Mac OS.
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:31.400]   Mac OS.
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.400]   It was just--
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:33.400]   It was funny.
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.400]   It's kind of generous.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:35.400]   You can't keep--
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.400]   It's almost full.
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:37.400]   10 point-- 10 point-- yeah.
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:38.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:40.400]   Well, now it's like 10.11.
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.400]   I mean, it was 10.12.
[00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:42.400]   It's weird.
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.400]   It is a little weird, 10.11, 10.12.
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.200]   Yeah, that is a little weird.
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.160]   And everybody still calls it Mac OS X.
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.160]   Although--
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.160]   Oh, no, they've never got over that.
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:56.360]   That's a useful thing for distinguishing the true nerd from the pretender.
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.360]   Yes, yes.
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.360]   Anybody who says X, you're like--
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.080]   I listened to an audible book.
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:07.160]   It was actually the really good book about Steve Jobs called Becoming Steve Jobs.
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:09.840]   Bill Atkinson said that was his favorite of all the Jobs books.
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.600]   Of course, he knew Jobs pretty well.
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.920]   And the reader for unaccountably called it OS X the whole time.
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:16.920]   Oh.
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:17.920]   Oh.
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:18.920]   Oh.
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:19.920]   Someone would have corrected them.
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:21.600]   That's what I ask.
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.600]   Where's the producer?
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:26.360]   I don't expect the reader to know that, but the producer, that's the producer's job.
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:31.160]   So Mac OS-- capital X for Mac OS.
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:34.040]   Anyway, Mac OS is easier, right?
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:35.040]   But somebody--
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.480]   This is my throwback.
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.920]   Somebody call it Macos.
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:38.920]   Somebody will.
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.720]   I want to be-- I want to be System 11.
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:41.720]   That's what I want.
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.720]   System 11.
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:43.720]   System 11.
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:45.920]   I've been waiting for OS 11.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.240]   I've been waiting for like that.
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:51.280]   I figured that would be the fusion of iOS and OS X where we would finally like get an OS
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.280]   OS 11.
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:56.880]   But no, I mean, now we're just going to get Mac OS and TV OS and watch OS and iOS.
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:57.880]   Apple's really--
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:13:59.760]   And your own apps and iOS.
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:00.920]   Streamlining the whole thing.
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.480]   They don't even have names for their stuff.
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.800]   It's the iPad Pro.
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:05.800]   Just the Pro.
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:06.800]   It's all you need to know.
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:07.800]   You pick a size.
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:08.800]   This is the new--
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:09.800]   The Mac book.
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:10.800]   Yeah, it's just all--
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.400]   It's been Apple's laptops and desktops for a long time.
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.400]   It's always the new iMac.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:14.400]   Right.
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.680]   The iMac with Retina Display, the new Mac book Pro.
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:21.680]   That only bothers us because we write about it, we talk about it, and we need a way to
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:23.280]   distinguish it.
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:24.520]   I guess that makes sense.
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.280]   You don't say the new Saturn.
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:34.760]   No, you don't say the 2015 Saturn unless you're the person buying that specific book.
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:39.320]   Or when people ask you like, "Oh, you have a Toyota Prius?
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.320]   Cool.
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.720]   What does your Toyota Prius have?
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.040]   Oh, well, it has the climate control and the other side.
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.640]   You don't say the Prius 6.4.
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:50.200]   Not only in the computer industry to do it, we do that.
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:53.360]   But for those of us who talk about it and write about it, you need precision is kind
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:58.760]   of important to distinguish, for instance, the 2015 MacBook from the 2014 MacBook.
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:02.600]   So back to that subject, Christina, you liked it?
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.160]   It's the core M still, right?
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:05.160]   Yes.
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.160]   Skylake.
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:07.160]   Skylake.
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.120]   Skylake, yeah, which has made a big difference in performance.
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:11.120]   It has.
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.120]   Okay.
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.120]   It has.
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.920]   I mean, so-- and I noted this in my review.
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:18.600]   The one that I tested last year was, I guess, what would now be like, right, kind of, the
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:23.120]   core M3, the last year they were just calling it the core M, and that was the 1.1 gigahertz.
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:28.520]   I reviewed, and I think all the review units they seeded were the 1.2 gigahertz model.
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.880]   And so, M5.
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:31.880]   And so--
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:34.800]   So that's nominally slower clock speed.
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:38.000]   No, I mean, it's faster than last year's.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.160]   And so my results, my geek bench results were about, you know, about 25 to 30 percent better
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:44.160]   than last year's.
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.720]   So that wasn't really apples to apples.
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:51.160]   Based on other geek bench results, you saw about a 15 to 20 percent increase in raw CPU
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.680]   speed and then a 25 percent increase in GPU.
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:54.680]   Wow.
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:55.680]   That's significant.
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:56.680]   So there is a performance.
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:57.680]   It is.
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:58.680]   And I think that's all coming from Skylake.
[00:15:58.680 --> 00:15:59.840]   You know, I think A, it's two things.
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.640]   One, Skylake finally is here.
[00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:03.160]   There were a lot of improvements on that.
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:07.480]   And I think the secondary thing is that, you know, this is now their second iteration
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.440]   with core M, so they've been able to do more with it.
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:12.880]   So I think you're still going to hit those roadblocks.
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:16.600]   And for me, I don't think I could make it a daily driver for me.
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.000]   It's so close, which is what's the annoying thing.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.960]   Just because it's not fast enough, or is it the keyboard and other issues?
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:24.840]   Well, it's a couple of things that I think for me, mostly, well, honestly, be some of
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.200]   the GPU stuff.
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:30.800]   I convinced my best friend to buy one of these last year.
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:35.720]   And she will yell at me every time her Mac does not perform correctly.
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:38.320]   She screams at me when Chrome and tweet deck and other things.
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.320]   It is my fault.
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.720]   Well, because I was the one who told her to buy it and I said, it'll be great for you,
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:43.440]   but it'll be just fine.
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:47.000]   And then, you know, can we just establish that we are in no way responsible for your
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.640]   choices with computing.
[00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.200]   Yes, please, please establish that.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.440]   We will talk about things.
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:53.440]   We like things.
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.440]   We're in the zoo zis.
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:56.440]   We might make suggestions.
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:58.440]   I'm not your mom.
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:16:59.440]   I'm not your dad.
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.440]   I'm not your daddy.
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.880]   Don't blame us for your bad choices.
[00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:08.280]   Don't blame me, but yet I do feel guilty, you know, because she bought this gold contraption.
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:09.280]   Was there peer pressure?
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:10.280]   Was it like, no.
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:11.280]   It was not your pressure.
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.280]   You want to be cool, right?
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:13.280]   Come on.
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:16.280]   Well, I mean, I said, she was asking, should I get this or should I get a souped up, you
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:17.280]   know, Macbook Air?
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:20.600]   And I was like, I think the new Macbook, I think it'll be perfect for what you do it.
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:21.600]   Use it for.
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:24.480]   And then it turns out that tweet deck and Chrome are kind of memory hogs.
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:28.080]   And kind of, if she doesn't restart it every day, it kind of slows down.
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:31.920]   So I think the new model will alleviate a lot of those concerns.
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:36.480]   But I think for what I do, just with having so many things open, I would be concerned about
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:40.040]   making it a daily driver, but it's getting so close.
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:44.440]   I do, my big, I guess, complaint with it, two things.
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:47.720]   One, I mean, I love the design still and I'm not even upset that they didn't update
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.120]   the design.
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:52.200]   I still do wish that there was a second USB-C port.
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.200]   Me too.
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:56.960]   I feel like that was the one thing I really thought they should have done.
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:57.960]   Yeah.
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.960]   And I mean, maybe they can't.
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:00.960]   Maybe they can't.
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:05.760]   There could be room, but I think it would probably require a big, you know, update to
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:06.760]   the chassis design.
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:10.360]   And I understand if they don't want to do that for March, Johnny's on vacation.
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:11.840]   Johnny's on vacation.
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:17.440]   What is less, I guess, okay with me is the idea that they did not go ahead and update
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.360]   that USB-C to Thunderbolt 3.
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:22.000]   Because that's built into the chipset.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   That's built in.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.320]   It is an odd admission, isn't it?
[00:18:25.320 --> 00:18:30.520]   And so, and so to me, even with one port, if that we were Thunderbolt 3, then you could,
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:34.080]   without any question at all, you would be in dongle hell, but you're going to be in dongle
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:38.800]   hell regardless, you could have a million things connected to it and be confident in
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:41.560]   the throughput of that port.
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:43.720]   So I feel like it would be more future proof that way.
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:47.800]   My secondary concern, and I was completely fine with the price last year.
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:52.320]   I felt like the price was where it is for the type of device that it is.
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.840]   This year, I wish that they'd come in $100 less.
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:59.640]   I feel like it would be an easier thing to recommend if it were $100 less expensive, just
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:06.680]   because even though it is faster on both the SSC and the processor GPU, it looks the same.
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:12.000]   And because it still has the one port and it still has the non-Thunderbolt 3 port, I really
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.480]   feel like if they've been able to come in at $100 less, it would be that much more compelling.
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:21.240]   Because at this point, as you pointed out, Serenity and on iMore, it's not just competing
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:25.040]   against other ultra books.
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:27.880]   It's also now competing against things like the iPad Pro.
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:33.760]   So I feel like the ecosystem of when you're buying an ultra portable in 2016, you have
[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:35.120]   a lot more things to consider.
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:39.200]   Well, it's also pretty clearly going to replace the MacBook Air.
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:40.200]   Yeah, eventually.
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:42.600]   And that's going to be a big problem.
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:46.680]   Because the Air has ports and power.
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:51.720]   The Air, but you have to remember, when the Air first came out, the Air was greatly derided
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:55.680]   as having way too few ports and vastly underpowered.
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:57.880]   And it took in very expensive.
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:02.880]   And that one port you have to flip it down, it was ridiculous.
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:07.720]   But I mean, the Air brought both the price down and they managed to position it as a
[00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:10.960]   sweet spot for this is not the laptop for power users.
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:15.120]   This is the laptop for people who want a small machine who want to travel.
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:18.760]   And I think that the MacBook will eventually get to that position.
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:21.120]   But it's never going to compete against a pro laptop.
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:25.120]   The pro laptops are going to eventually borrow some of its design.
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:29.040]   But I mean, if you want more ports on your Mac, you're going to want to go for a MacBook
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.040]   Pro.
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:31.040]   Yeah.
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:32.040]   Good point.
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.040]   Yeah.
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:35.360]   And by the way, Christina posted her link to her gold collection.
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.560]   I don't know if the Beats count.
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:38.560]   Do the Beats count?
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:39.560]   The Beats count counts.
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.040]   Is that Rose gold?
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.040]   Those beats?
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.040]   Are they?
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.040]   Yes, they are.
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.040]   Of course, the Rose gold Apple Beats.
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:46.040]   I bought them.
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:47.360]   I literally bought them just because of the color.
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:51.960]   I had the identical pair of headphones in red and they came out with them in Rose gold.
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:54.280]   And I literally that day went to the Apple store.
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:56.040]   Like I went in the rain.
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:57.720]   I was like, I have to get these.
[00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:00.160]   And that is how you know that you have a problem.
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:07.320]   I come from a era of computing where this kind of silliness makes no sense at all.
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:08.320]   I mean, you- Oh, come on.
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.240]   This sort of silliness has existed forever.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.440]   Remember when HP had the Vera Wing laptops?
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:13.680]   Yeah, but they were terrible.
[00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:14.680]   Nobody bought them.
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.680]   They were.
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:20.440]   And Acer made it as a spire because they saw the iMac, you know, that's Bondi Blue iMac.
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:21.560]   They said, oh my God.
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:24.600]   The future of computers is designed in color.
[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:27.840]   So they made a hideous green.
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:32.560]   It had holes in it like Swiss cheese, Acer as spire, which also nobody bought.
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:34.880]   And everybody said, oh, only Apple has the customers.
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.000]   It'll pay for this stuff.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.960]   We're going back to beige boxes.
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:38.960]   See you.
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:39.960]   Right.
[00:21:39.960 --> 00:21:40.960]   That's a good point.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.960]   And they still do.
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:42.960]   I remember the black MacBook.
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:43.960]   I paid that black tax.
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:45.800]   I have a hundred bucks for black paint.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:46.800]   I did two.
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:47.800]   I did two.
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:48.800]   I paid it.
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:49.800]   I did two.
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:52.600]   I had the most good looking laptops that I owned for years.
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:53.840]   We still have it.
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.080]   I still have mine too.
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.160]   It's probably my favorite back of all time.
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.880]   If I'm being totally honest, it was my black MacBook.
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:21:59.880]   My black MacBook is...
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:00.880]   It's the modern Wall Street.
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:01.880]   Why?
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:03.880]   Black is good.
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:04.880]   Yeah.
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:05.880]   Matte black.
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:10.160]   Matte black you're not going to see on the MacBooks or the iPad Pro though.
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.920]   Apple knows his audience.
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:15.960]   However, they might want to stop lying to the audience.
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:21.560]   The Apple press release claiming all sorts of wonderful things from recycling.
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:27.040]   According to motherboard, Jason Kobler says, "Almost nothing about the Apple Harvest's
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:30.880]   Gold from iPhone's story is true."
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:35.720]   Apple put out the word that they've got $40 million worth of recycled gold.
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:38.600]   Now I don't know if Apple said that or if it was just the headline writers and all the
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:42.440]   articles I read like CNN and Fox and Offing and Post.
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:45.320]   But apparently that is not a realistic number.
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:50.280]   The L's pointed out that all of Apple's recycling numbers when you change them to metric tons
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:56.200]   are perfectly round, like five zeros round.
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:23:01.880]   But they release them as US pounds, which made it look like very interestingly precise
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.840]   numbers.
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:08.040]   I don't blame Apple for trying to promote the fact that they're recycling.
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:12.760]   This is a big issue.
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:14.760]   Read it with a grain of salt.
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:17.960]   It's easy for a reporter to see something.
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:19.280]   They're like, "Oh, it's a press release.
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:21.200]   Apple's not going to lie to us."
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:22.200]   Apple and the lawns.
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.440]   Someone's like, "Oh, this thing just popped up.
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:26.440]   Can someone bust this out really quick?
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:27.840]   You write it in 10, 15 minutes.
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.840]   You move on to the next article."
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:36.360]   Unfortunately, you get caught a lot of times with that sort of stuff.
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:40.320]   It's tough when you're, like I said, those little 15-minute hits trying to get them up
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:41.320]   on the site.
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.320]   Well, you get...
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:45.320]   It worked.
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:46.880]   We double checked everything we did.
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:47.880]   It worked.
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:48.880]   Right.
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:54.160]   They played the media perfectly because everybody picked up the headline, ran the headline,
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:56.120]   and he consumer that saw the headline remembers that.
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:59.080]   There, nobody's going to see this motherboard article saying, "Well, it's not quite true."
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:01.200]   They quote Kyle Wiens, a good friend of the network.
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.880]   He's the CEO of IFixit.
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:05.680]   He says, "Really what's going on is like carbon offsets.
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:10.920]   They cut recyclers at check and then say, 'Give us credit for recycling a million pounds.'"
[00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:17.880]   The percentage Apple is actually recycling is a tiny, tiny fraction.
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:18.880]   Almost all of the...
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:22.600]   According to Kyle, almost all of the e-waste in the U.S. is collected by folks like Goodwill,
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:27.760]   municipal recycling programs are specific electronics recyclers.
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:32.960]   Even though Apple has the stores and the mailback program, they don't recycle a whole lot of
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:33.960]   stuff.
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:38.280]   And that poor robot, Liam, probably is not very busy.
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:41.280]   Well, he's near.
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:42.280]   He's new.
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:43.280]   He's new.
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:47.280]   And honestly, the thing that frustrates me about these stories is if you actually look
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:52.800]   at Apple's environmental responsibility report, nowhere in that report do they say we were...
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:53.800]   Did they say 40 million?
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:54.800]   Yeah.
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:55.800]   No.
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:59.760]   The specific words they use were "amount of material recovered for reuse to take back
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:01.640]   initiatives in 2015."
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:06.360]   Not even through our take back initiatives, just through take back initiatives, that
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:11.040]   it's just citing the amount of pounds of gold that they recycled.
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:15.200]   And then people spun that off as, "Oh, that's a lot of gold.
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.120]   That means that Apple's making bank."
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:18.120]   Right.
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:23.120]   And in fact, iPhones do not represent a significant portion of recycling.
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:27.400]   In Washington state, Apple products are 1.78 percent of the total amount of e-waste.
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:31.960]   Not even just waste, but e-waste recycled, an Oregon 1.65 percent.
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:36.000]   So e-waste is an issue because it has to be recycled specially.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   It's not...
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.560]   There's Liam, the robot, the iPhone disassembling robot.
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:41.440]   Oh, I mean, and that's why they created Liam.
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:42.920]   And I think that he's one of those things.
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:47.520]   I mean, it's a new initiative and Samantha Murphy, Kelly of Mash, will look at him and
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.520]   wrote a whole thing about that.
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:50.520]   Oh, this sheet?
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:51.520]   Oh, me.
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:53.320]   And got to really in depth report about how it works.
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:54.320]   But that's a new thing.
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:58.840]   And I think it right now only works for one model of phone, but it'll obviously be able
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:00.400]   to be expanded in the future.
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:04.160]   So I think that this is something that they're looking towards the future, being able to
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.200]   do more of that sort of disassembly.
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.200]   We'll see.
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:11.080]   But Serenity makes an excellent point.
[00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:14.680]   If you read their report, the language they use, they're very clear about saying, "We're
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:15.680]   not saying it.
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:16.680]   We're us doing this."
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:17.680]   It's just all of these things.
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:21.840]   But they recognize, I think, both for the good of the environment and probably fiscally,
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:26.120]   too, it makes sense to be able to have waste, disassemble, and reuse these materials.
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:31.640]   But you have to feel a little bit for title, the streaming music network that has just
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:37.160]   been struggling, made a lot of deals with artists for exclusives.
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:40.680]   They got the exclusive on Beyonce's, "How do you pronounce that?
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:41.680]   Beyonce?
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:42.680]   Beyonce."
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:43.680]   Beyonce.
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:44.680]   Beyonce.
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:45.680]   Thank you.
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:46.680]   I knew you would know, Christina.
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:47.680]   Beyonce's Lemonade.
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:48.680]   Is it good?
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:49.680]   Do you like Lemonade?
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:50.680]   It's fantastic.
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:51.680]   She's amazing.
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.480]   Didn't she just release it album like six months ago?
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.480]   It was more than a year ago.
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.480]   It's been that long while.
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:57.480]   She released that song.
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:59.520]   She did that secret thing, though.
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:04.720]   The whole time she was touring, she recorded an album and then just sprang in on everybody.
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:05.840]   She's very good marketing.
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:13.240]   This time, there was an HBO special and title got the exclusive for one day.
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:14.240]   And then it was on iTunes.
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:16.160]   Yeah, and then it was on iTunes.
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:20.440]   And so Christina, who subscribes to everything and somehow got stuck right into subscribing
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:24.400]   to title for freaking Beyonce, that subscription is getting canceled.
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:25.400]   It's awesome.
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:26.400]   Oh, sorry.
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.400]   I'm sorry.
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:30.360]   I'm sorry to just buy this.
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:33.480]   I watched half of it today and I was like, "Oh my God, this is amazing."
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:34.480]   Is it really good?
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:35.480]   It's really good.
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:37.480]   We should just watch it.
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:39.600]   I don't know why we're going to be talking about anything else.
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.640]   We should just be talking about Beyonce and watching Lemonade.
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.480]   And then the podcast, Go Watch Lemonade.
[00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:48.680]   And Serenity was talking about the actually very political song she released, was it
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:49.680]   last month?
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:50.680]   Formation, yeah.
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:51.680]   And Formation.
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:54.360]   Was is that on Lemonade or is that completely just?
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:55.360]   It is.
[00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:56.360]   It is actually on it.
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:57.360]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:00.080]   So that was released right before her Super Bowl performance.
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:04.040]   And then she dropped the album along with the HBO special last night.
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:07.720]   And then of course, because she's Beyonce, even though it was sort of kind of, we all
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:11.880]   knew something was coming with the HBO special, she happens to do it during like HBO's Free
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:13.200]   Weekend.
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.480]   And it was also an HBO Go and HBO Now.
[00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:16.480]   She's such a genius.
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:23.560]   But when you like to be a fly in the wall, Jay-Z comes to bed and says, "Thank you, babe.
[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:27.160]   You gave me the exclusive on title."
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:29.520]   So Jay actually, she doesn't call him Jay-Z.
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:30.520]   That's his stage name.
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:31.920]   She calls him with Sean, right?
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:35.120]   So Sean, I got some bad news for you.
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:36.320]   It's just one day.
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.520]   It's going on by iTunes tonight.
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:41.360]   So it's only available for iTunes for purchase.
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:42.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.360]   Yeah, okay.
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:47.960]   It's just for streaming, which is not a huge differentiation because let's be honest,
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:51.080]   anybody who likes Beyonce is going to immediately buy the album.
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:52.080]   Right.
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.760]   So that's one of those albums like Taylor Swift's 1989.
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:56.160]   That's just instant buy.
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:57.600]   Yes, it's going in my cart.
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.440]   Yes, I'm paying money for it.
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:00.440]   Totally.
[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:01.440]   It's only $10.
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:05.280]   It's like Adele Beyonce Taylor Swift.
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.840]   They are the people who will get people to actually spend money on me.
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:12.320]   So this isn't, so one of the reasons I brought it up is to see how these artists are kind
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:15.520]   of managing quite well the new digital world.
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:18.720]   But it's only these mega celebrities who can do this.
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:19.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:21.920]   Small brands, medium sized bands.
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:24.000]   They don't make anything.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.480]   They're going on tour.
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:28.320]   That's how they're making their money is touring.
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:31.840]   And you really have to be careful about how you tour.
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:36.920]   You could be, Bander's doing pretty well, but you're not going to want to bring like
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:39.120]   14 musicians on tour.
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:43.600]   You're not going to want a giant light show unless you're able to sell out stadiums.
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:49.640]   Roberto, I was so jealous because the last time you were here, it was Academy Award night.
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:55.000]   And I was going to go home and watch the Oscars and you had tickets to go see Prince in Oakland,
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.920]   a man in his piano.
[00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:57.920]   How was that show?
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:58.920]   Was it amazing?
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:00.560]   It was so amazing.
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:05.320]   I was, you know, here you sit, you're sitting forward and you're like, when you're, you know,
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:07.120]   someone's telling you like a really great story.
[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:08.120]   That was the entire night.
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:10.400]   I was like, you stand up, you sit down, you're just like, this is amazing.
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:17.640]   This is a man who is as a musician, as an artist, as someone who's able to control his
[00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:21.800]   art and control, you know, who he is in the media.
[00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:26.080]   It's so much about Prince that I find, or I found just amazing.
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:30.200]   And then to see him and this, yeah, it's hard for me to talk about it.
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:34.400]   I'm so sad because I wanted to go and I knew the tickets were going on sale and I missed
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:35.400]   it.
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:36.400]   I forgot.
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:39.640]   And, but you know, like most of us, we said, well, I'll see him next time.
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:42.160]   And of course, that's the last time.
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:45.320]   He had a very reason I'm bringing this up.
[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:52.320]   Well, first of all, to commemorate a genius, artistic genius in a very challenging relationship
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:54.320]   with the internet, didn't he?
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:59.280]   Yeah, you know, he was the first person, like, Hey, here's a streaming service before
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.080]   anyone else thought that was a good idea.
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:05.000]   And then, you know, and then he became very anti-internet at some point.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.160]   He's like the internet's over the internet's, you know, and he pulled everything you can't
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:10.160]   do.
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:13.720]   He sued people for, he sued a mom for having a Prince song in the background who were
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:14.720]   dancing baby.
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:16.720]   I mean, he went crazy.
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:17.720]   Yeah.
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:21.960]   And you know, if you, well, that's, that's kind of a part of what happens with the law.
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:25.440]   If you don't protect, if you're not actively protecting your art, you have to.
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:26.440]   Yeah.
[00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:27.440]   Okay.
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:30.360]   But, you know, he wanted to control his music, which, you know, as someone who's an artist,
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:32.160]   I give them props for that.
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:34.160]   You know, some people, you know, you want the streaming stuff.
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:35.160]   He didn't want it.
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:36.160]   He wanted people to buy his music.
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.600]   He was angry at the music industry.
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:41.640]   And very famously, that's why he changed his name to an artist formerly known as Prince.
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:42.840]   He was the symbol.
[00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:46.320]   Even had the slave written on his cheek.
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:50.280]   And that was, I think, reasonably directed against the music industry and music industry
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:55.360]   that even to this day rips off artists.
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:59.680]   Why didn't he see the internet as the savior, as the alternative to that?
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:03.960]   He saw it really as a way of the music industry was using to continue to rip off artists.
[00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:09.920]   I think he just saw that suddenly people were able to listen to his music without pain
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:10.920]   for it.
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:12.200]   You know, he put a value on his art.
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:16.320]   And when people aren't, you know, they're not paying that for that value, then what's,
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:19.040]   you know, you're, you know, I work hard for this.
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:20.680]   Why aren't you standing for this?
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:22.880]   You know, and if you're a writer, that's the same thing.
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:26.400]   If you're an, I fear any sort of artist, if you create something, I feel like you should
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.720]   get some compensation for that.
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:34.200]   And when, you know, I can just hop on to YouTube and listen to almost any band I want without
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:36.760]   paying without a streaming service, that's-
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:38.640]   I understand that emotionally.
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:39.640]   I understand that.
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:42.520]   But you also have to recognize reality.
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:46.560]   And you're not going to put away the internet by not letting your stuff be on the internet.
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:47.560]   You're not.
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:52.560]   But at the same time, there are very few artists and he was one of them that could actually
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:57.720]   fight and still sell out stadiums and still do tours and still release music and make money
[00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:01.360]   that way and still have a catalog business that would make money.
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:06.600]   You know, obviously his, his, his approach would not work for any new artist, but he'd
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:09.320]   been around long enough that he could kind of do that sort of thing.
[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:12.320]   You know, he owns all of, he owned all of his own masters, for instance, which I think
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:15.720]   also put him in a little bit of a different situation, especially when it comes to streaming
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:20.520]   services and to, and, and to the internet than other artists because a lot of times,
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:26.480]   you know, as Virtus saying, you know, he put a value on his music, but that value is different,
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:30.040]   I think when you own your own masters and when you really kind of own your own destiny,
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:33.520]   then when a label owns it and you're only getting a small piece anyway.
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:39.320]   I wonder what's going to happen because he apparently has more than 2000 unreleased tracks
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:41.960]   in the vaults and Paisley Park.
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:45.800]   And you know, I don't know who's going to be his executor who's going to manage the
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:53.440]   estate, but I'm curious because this is an opportunity for the, for whoever is managing
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:57.880]   it to get the music to the fans directly.
[00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:00.240]   If they can just embrace this technology.
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:01.240]   Yeah.
[00:34:01.240 --> 00:34:04.280]   Well, I mean, there, and he, Prince said that he didn't just have a vault.
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:09.200]   He had vaults of unreleased music, unreleased videos, unreleased, you know, movies,
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:10.680]   separate versions of albums.
[00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:11.680]   Wow.
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:12.680]   Yeah.
[00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:15.280]   Like thousands and thousands of songs that are going to be available and whether.
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:16.380]   Well, aren't they though?
[00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:17.380]   That's my question.
[00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:18.380]   How are we going to?
[00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:19.380]   That's, that's the question.
[00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:21.920]   Prince could have said in his will, he's like, I don't want anyone to ever see these
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:25.680]   or he could have said, you know what, I have, you know, I'm going to give you the opportunity
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:29.440]   to release these either as physical media or you can only sell it.
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:31.560]   I mean, I don't think he's there.
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:34.440]   You know, he probably made stipulations not to allow streaming.
[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:35.440]   Right.
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:40.200]   And if I were Prince and that was my mindset, I would say, no, you have to buy a record.
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:43.760]   It's only available on vinyl, which I'm totally fine with, but I'm a weirdo.
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:49.680]   The Grateful Dead have thousands of tracks, recordings of concerts and more in their vaults.
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:55.160]   And they have been very slowly, but, but fairly liberally releasing those, they want to make
[00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:56.400]   sure that the quality is good.
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:59.480]   They remix them and then they release them.
[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:06.200]   I hope that there's some vision from Prince's estate to give us this material.
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:07.200]   He is on title.
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:08.200]   It is worth noting.
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:09.200]   His entire title.
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:10.200]   He is on title.
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:11.200]   Yeah.
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:12.800]   That's the only service that his entire catalog is on.
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:13.800]   So he removed everything.
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:17.360]   And that's, do you think because he loves Jay Z and he just wanted to support Jay Z or
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.360]   that was what he'd said to Ebony.
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:20.960]   So there was this interesting article.
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:23.920]   There was this interesting interview he gave to Ebony last year.
[00:35:23.920 --> 00:35:26.080]   And what was interesting about this interview was that the interview went up.
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:27.080]   It was very wide ranging.
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:29.880]   He like said a lot of things that he'd never talked about before.
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:34.400]   And then the next day, the interview was pulled and a very like, I for Kated, this is up.
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:40.160]   And apparently, Prince claimed and the author disputes this that things were off the record.
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:44.040]   So it was this very weird scenario where even like billboard who aggregated the interview
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:46.760]   to begin with, even their aggregated copy was pulled.
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:48.560]   So it was a very weird thing.
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:51.720]   And that's what's interesting, I think, about this too, is that he was such a, he has so
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:56.560]   much control, not just over his art, but over what interviews he did and his image.
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:36:00.840]   And it'll be interesting to see not just how his estate, I think, handles things like
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:06.680]   all these unreleased, you know, vaults of music, but also how, you know, other interviews
[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:10.960]   and other projects and other things that he did over the years, how that will be preserved
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:13.480]   and released or will it be released?
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:14.480]   That'll be interesting.
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:15.480]   Yeah.
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:16.480]   Yeah.
[00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:21.760]   I mean, I totally respect his desire to keep control.
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:24.840]   And it's because he did that he owns the masters and things like that.
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:31.360]   And that's, that was the right, really the right thing to do for him as an artist.
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:38.000]   At this point, though, I wonder what happens to all of that material.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.160]   And, you know, it's hard to know what he would want.
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:45.200]   It's interesting that just days before he passed, he finally said, okay, you can let
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:50.600]   that Coachella performance of creep go on YouTube.
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:52.360]   That was just read this a few days ago.
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:53.360]   Yeah, it was just recently.
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:54.360]   Yeah.
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:55.360]   Yeah.
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:57.440]   Well, that was, that was what made it interesting, like, that the way the internet covered his
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:58.440]   passing.
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:00.440]   I mean, first we got over the shock and then the first thing you want to do is you want
[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:02.000]   to do is you want to do this thing.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:05.200]   And, and, and he's not on YouTube, you know, and, and he's not on Spotify.
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:08.160]   You know, he's on title, but like nobody used to subscribe to title.
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:13.680]   And so, well, except for me, because of Beyonce, it was honestly one of those things that was
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:17.560]   like, honestly, I'll get aside thing, Princess whole catalog too.
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:20.200]   So it's like, you know, this, this weird thing where, you know, you're trying to find a way
[00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:25.120]   to kind of like mourn his fans and listen to his music and, and, you know, for all kind
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:26.800]   of like relegated to buying iTunes.
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:30.480]   It's very retro because literally the way that you normally would like when David Bowie
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:34.960]   passed, you know, you would just go on YouTube, you know, go on on these services.
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:35.960]   Go on streaming.
[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:40.800]   And it's like with Prince, nope, can't do that because he was extremely good at getting
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.280]   all those things taken down.
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:43.280]   I don't know.
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.280]   Go ahead.
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:49.000]   Apple Apple music did something really interesting where, of course, Princess catalog is not on
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   Apple music.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.960]   However, Beats One has a, has a broadcast license.
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:58.280]   They have a radio license, which covers Prince's catalog.
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:04.480]   So for the pretty much starting with his passing, Zane loaded in an extra, an extra hour on
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:08.560]   his show, played nothing but Prince, Julian and Nougat played nothing but Prince for an
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:12.400]   hour and then played songs inspired by Prince for two hours.
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:16.240]   And then this entire weekend have been basically Prince love fests.
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:20.240]   And that's like, that's one of the one of the really compelling things to Beats One
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:22.520]   is, yeah, Apple music doesn't have this music.
[00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:25.320]   That's where live radio can really see.
[00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:26.320]   It's serious.
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:27.320]   It's doing the same thing.
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:30.480]   I can't remember what station was, but one of the serious channels was literally playing
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:32.040]   nothing but Prince 24/7.
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:33.040]   And you're right.
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:37.480]   Like that, that, that is where having a broadcast license actually is really compelling
[00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:39.120]   because you could turn into Beats One.
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:45.440]   You could turn into serious if you subscribe to that and hear the music, which seems feel
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:47.280]   so retro to have to do that.
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:48.280]   It really does.
[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:49.280]   Yeah.
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:53.840]   There was the Minneapolis local radio station in Minneapolis was playing Prince nonstop.
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:57.120]   And it wasn't just playing Prince because there's, you know, he was so part of that
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:58.120]   city.
[00:38:58.120 --> 00:38:59.640]   They were interviewing people who knew Prince.
[00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:01.400]   They were interviewing people from the band.
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:03.120]   They're interviewed local reporters.
[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:06.080]   And so it was, it was, I mean, it's great for them.
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:08.600]   But you know, now what?
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:09.600]   Yeah.
[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:13.000]   You have to wonder what the right strategy is for an artist.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   It's just unclear.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   There's no roadmap.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:18.480]   It's all new and all different.
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:23.040]   But it is certainly true that, you know, so I found out about it on Twitter, right?
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:24.040]   Of course.
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:25.960]   That's where you find out about these things.
[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:32.080]   And it's funny because I had been on, I actually was on GNU Social, which is kind of the open
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:34.320]   source alternative to Twitter.
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:35.320]   And it's very small.
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:36.400]   I mean, there's a bunch of them.
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:38.520]   There's quitter.no and so forth.
[00:39:38.520 --> 00:39:39.520]   That's the one I'm on.
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:41.680]   And, you know, it's very geeky.
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:45.200]   Corey Doctorow posts there a lot, stuff like that.
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:48.560]   But I noticed there's not, you know, there's not a lot of news, not a lot going on.
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:52.960]   And so just to add a chance, I switched over to Twitter just to compare the two.
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:58.240]   And there it was literally that I think the first tweet I saw was Prince has died and
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:00.360]   it was shocked, of course.
[00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:01.840]   And then of course, what's the first thing you do?
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:05.640]   You stay there, you look, you want to verify it, of course, and you do that.
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:07.040]   I didn't run to the radio.
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:08.800]   I didn't run to CNN.
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:09.800]   You stay online.
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:10.800]   You start watching videos.
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:13.160]   You start watching tributes.
[00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:15.640]   This is what we do now.
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:20.680]   And I think anybody who, you know, anybody who's an artist or in the public has to think
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:24.240]   about, well, what does that mean going forward?
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:29.360]   How do you know, does it make even make any sense to hold on to stuff?
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:33.400]   If you, the problem is you hold on to it, it's going to get out and you won't have control
[00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:35.120]   of how it gets out.
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:39.000]   So you need to have a strategy for how it's going to get out.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   Except the stuff in the vaults.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.880]   That may, we may lose that forever, which is probably not what he would have wanted
[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:46.440]   either, but who knows?
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:50.560]   All right, sad, but I wanted to acknowledge it.
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:53.440]   And obviously, Roberto, you're a fan and you were very fortunate.
[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:56.280]   You saw him twice in the last couple of months.
[00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:57.280]   Yeah, twice.
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:01.240]   One at the theater in Oakland and one at, once at Oracle Arena.
[00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:02.240]   Very nice.
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:05.160]   I mean, he got up, he danced, he wasn't, you know, he wasn't frail.
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:07.680]   He wrote off on a bicycle a few times in Oracle Arena.
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:09.840]   Yeah, he apparently liked to do that.
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:12.440]   At the end of the show, he'd go on a bicycle.
[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:15.720]   They'd like to go down and anybody who knew better would stay in the audience because
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:17.160]   he would be back.
[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:19.200]   But first he would ride around a bicycle.
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:20.200]   Yeah.
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:21.200]   What a character.
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:24.760]   Yeah, it was, I mean, both shows were amazing.
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:27.360]   Both shows, you know, different songs.
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:28.360]   Yeah.
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:32.000]   Do people, do people, I'm curious.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.360]   Do geeks turn to radio anymore as a, an all, I mean, you would have missed something really
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:39.480]   great if you didn't do that.
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:43.560]   Whether it's a Minneapolis station, which you could listen to on the internet or beats
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:44.560]   one.
[00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:46.120]   I didn't think to do that.
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:49.480]   And I work in radio.
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:53.640]   I mean, Twitter was the one who pointed the, pointed me to the beats to the, I'm sorry.
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:54.640]   That's what you did.
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:55.640]   You go to Twitter.
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:56.640]   Yeah.
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:57.640]   Yeah.
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:58.640]   You go to Twitter.
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:41:59.640]   Twitter is like, oh, they're playing prints the entire time.
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:03.840]   It's curated fountain of information, which is amazing.
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:04.840]   Yeah.
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:05.840]   Yep.
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:09.560]   So it's, that's why for all its flaws, it's not going away.
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:10.560]   I hope not.
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:11.560]   Well, it can't.
[00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:12.560]   It'll change a little bit.
[00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:13.560]   Oh, but it can't.
[00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:15.720]   I mean, that's what, I mean, I went to the GNU social.
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:17.600]   It's not the same.
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:18.840]   You need to be where everybody else is.
[00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:21.800]   And there's a community and there's just, you know, this vibrancy.
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:22.800]   Whoa.
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:27.760]   Speaking of vibrancy, a bunch of motorcycles just went outside.
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:29.160]   Are you watching Purple Rain?
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:31.600]   That was a weird thing because I want to watch Purple Rain that night.
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:35.520]   And I went to several sources, none of all of which had an error message when I started
[00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:36.520]   to play Purple Rain.
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:40.720]   And I was wondering, I wonder if this is, if they've been pulling this, I finally ended
[00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:45.400]   up buying it on one place I was able to buy it and we were able to watch it.
[00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:47.160]   But I thought that was odd.
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:50.680]   And of course, AMC is re-releasing it in this weekend.
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:52.320]   You'll be able to see it in many theaters.
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:53.320]   Yeah.
[00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:56.840]   I wonder if there were too many people trying to buy it at once.
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:58.840]   Maybe that's what it was.
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:04.520]   As Wikipedia, Wikimedia rather had an interesting blog post about how they handled the traffic.
[00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:06.080]   Didn't you, wasn't that interesting?
[00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:07.080]   Yeah.
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:08.080]   I thought it was fascinating.
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:12.800]   How they were able to cache that article because it had like 1.85 million views in the
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:14.000]   first hour or something.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.800]   And so how do you cache that without bringing down the rest of all the Wikimedia server
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:24.360]   run stuff and how do you serve the cache versions and then how do you handle edits and
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:25.360]   all those other things?
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:26.360]   So it was a really interesting rate.
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:29.560]   The book of Meta or Hart who was with the Wikimedia Foundation, here's the graph of
[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:33.520]   traffic, the sudden spike.
[00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:37.680]   And in 24 hours, 10 million views of the Prince web page.
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:39.760]   Just another place people go, I think, to find out.
[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:41.440]   Well, how old was he?
[00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:45.120]   At the very least, find out how old was he?
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:47.120]   And information.
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:48.120]   Yeah.
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:50.960]   Again, another thing to thank goodness for.
[00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:51.960]   We have Wikipedia.
[00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:56.120]   That's a, what a resource that is.
[00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:58.160]   People were trying to edit the article.
[00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:01.000]   In addition to the high traffic levels, so many people were trying to update the English
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:07.080]   language article that the rate of edit conflicts spiked at 15 per minute.
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:10.600]   That's five times the normal average.
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:15.280]   I'm not sure if that's because people wanted to put the end date on there or because they
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:17.440]   wanted to correct stuff.
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:19.120]   Really interesting how Wikipedia handles this.
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:22.360]   And of course, they were prepared because the same thing happened when Michael Jackson
[00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:23.360]   passed.
[00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:26.680]   I'd say they've had some opportunities to do this.
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:31.760]   Yeah, I think they mentioned in the article that they actually kind of introduced this
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:35.520]   whole thing after Michael Jackson passed because that was the first time they ever experienced
[00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:36.520]   traffic like this.
[00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:39.440]   I don't know if you guys remember this, but when Michael Jackson died, like Facebook briefly
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:40.440]   went down.
[00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:42.040]   I think that was in 2009.
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:46.120]   And so Facebook's, you know, server organization isn't what it is now, but that I think was
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:49.480]   such a shocking, I'll never forget my older sister calling me.
[00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:55.160]   I'm sure you said Facebook is down.
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:44:56.160]   Call me.
[00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:57.160]   You know, those things.
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:58.160]   And I was like, I'm aware I'm on the Internet.
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:44:59.160]   I see the TMZ article.
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:00.160]   I see the whole thing.
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:06.160]   I'm sending in shock and literally like Facebook went down for probably 15 minutes because so
[00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:09.840]   many people just instantly wanted to get on and talk about it.
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:10.840]   It's a new world.
[00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:11.840]   That's where we meet.
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:14.000]   That's our that's where that's our community center.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.520]   The, you know, the internet, the social media, that's where we talk in Twitter and Facebook
[00:45:17.520 --> 00:45:18.520]   primarily.
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:23.960]   And there's the New Yorker cover, which is just beautiful purple and rain.
[00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:28.040]   And they had that up within a few hours of his passing.
[00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:29.040]   Ah, sad.
[00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:30.040]   All right.
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:31.520]   We'll continue on.
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:32.680]   Lots more to talk about.
[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:35.520]   Great panel to do it with Roberto Baldwin is here from Engaged.
[00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:36.520]   He's a senior editor.
[00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:37.520]   Hello.
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:38.520]   Hello.
[00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:42.480]   Also joining us from Mashable.com Christina Warren.
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:46.040]   Great to see you film girl once again.
[00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:48.120]   And all the way from Baston.
[00:45:48.120 --> 00:45:52.360]   So ready to call well and I'm more.com.
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:53.920]   Our show today brought to you by Gazelle.
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:56.280]   When it's time to get a new phone.
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:58.720]   Well, there's two reasons to go to Gazelle now.
[00:45:58.720 --> 00:46:00.240]   Of course, to sell the old phone.
[00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:04.040]   If you go there right now, Gazelle.com, you get a quote that's good for 30 days.
[00:46:04.040 --> 00:46:05.640]   Locks them in, not you.
[00:46:05.640 --> 00:46:10.600]   But it gives you the chance to, you know, first of all, get the top dollar because nothing,
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:13.200]   nothing gains in value these days.
[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:15.120]   All these gadgets are going down every single day.
[00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:16.400]   So get the top price.
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:20.360]   But also gives you 30 days to decide to get the new phone, transfer your data over and
[00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:24.240]   then send it to Gazelle.com.
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:29.680]   They pay top dollar for all kinds of devices, even broken iPads and iPhones.
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:32.480]   They have value too.
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:35.600]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com.
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:36.520]   At least get the quote.
[00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:38.280]   At least know with that old stuff.
[00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:39.400]   Don't throw it in a drawer.
[00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:41.200]   You wouldn't throw a hundred dollar bill in the drawer.
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:43.960]   Don't throw your old stuff in the drawers.
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:45.920]   Go to Gazelle.com, find out what you're missing.
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:48.600]   When you're ready to sell it, they ship it for you for free.
[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:51.760]   They'll send you a box and then they'll turn it around fast.
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:55.440]   If you forget to wipe the data or you can't, they will do that for you.
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:58.840]   And they often adjust the value of their quote upwards.
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:01.880]   They guaranteed minimum, but not guaranteed maximum.
[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:04.640]   And twice I've used Gazelle, they've upped the value.
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:05.720]   They pay for something.
[00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:06.720]   That's nice.
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:07.880]   They don't have to do that.
[00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:08.880]   But they do.
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:11.040]   And I really appreciate that.
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:13.120]   Gazelle, G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com.
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:17.120]   They'll send you a check, PayPal credit, or if you want to get a little extra, get that
[00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:19.920]   Amazon gift card that'll bump it up by 5%.
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:23.120]   They also, there's another reason to go to Gazelle when it's time for a new phone.
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:25.640]   They sell certified pre-owned devices.
[00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:27.200]   It's only the Creme de la Creme.
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:33.600]   They have a variety of iPhones, including the 6S and the 6S Plus, the latest iPhones.
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:34.600]   They have iPads.
[00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:36.440]   They have Samsung Galaxy phones.
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:40.160]   Whenever a new phone or pad comes out, that's the time to go to Gazelle because that means
[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:41.760]   they're going to get a flood of new stuff.
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:46.200]   And the very best stuff they inspect, they put it through their 30-point inspection,
[00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:49.920]   make sure it's not only fully functional but in great shape.
[00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:52.000]   And they will sell it in a variety of qualities.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:57.280]   So you can choose, do you want it to be perfect or do you want to save a little more money
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:01.640]   and have it slightly, gently used, you get the choice.
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:05.440]   And of course, everything you buy at Gazelle is backed by a 30-day return policy and sold
[00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:08.280]   without carrier contract.
[00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:12.840]   Gazelle, G-E-Z-E-L-L-E.com, you can get financing from a firm now.
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:15.360]   That's an easy checkbox right there at checkout.
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:17.000]   You'll be approved instantly.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:23.400]   They also offer warranties for cell phones and iPads powered by assurance solutions.
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:28.240]   The cover's not just defects but water damage and cracked screens too.
[00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:31.960]   Gazelle is a great place to go to sell and to buy.
[00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:37.680]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E Gazelle.com.
[00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:43.320]   Google in trouble with the EU.
[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:50.200]   It's been a year in the making but the EU has decided to lodge a formal antitrust charge
[00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:58.120]   against Google saying that they use their 90% market share to promote the Android operating
[00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:03.760]   system, to force carriers to put Google software on Android.
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:05.520]   You don't have to, by the way.
[00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:10.960]   Anybody like Amazon could use Android's software but if you want to put to Google Play Store
[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:15.880]   on there, Google Maps, then Google Search, then you need to go to Google and you need
[00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:19.600]   to make an arrangement.
[00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:22.000]   They feel like the EU feels like this is wrong.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.040]   They have potential fines with the $7 billion.
[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:26.640]   I don't think we'll see fines that hard.
[00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:30.920]   Google has 12 weeks to respond.
[00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:34.320]   Problem with all of this, in my opinion, is it's moving so fast.
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:38.360]   Remember this is similar to what the Department of Justice said to Microsoft in 1998.
[00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:43.760]   They said, "You're using your market share on desktops to enter the new internet market,
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:46.000]   force people to use internet explorer."
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.760]   In the EU, the end result was that was completely stupid.
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:50.600]   It was a ballot.
[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:54.440]   When you install Windows on a computer or first boot it up on a computer in the EU, until
[00:49:54.440 --> 00:50:00.240]   very recently you'd get a ballot in which you get to choose which browser you wanted
[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:02.520]   to install on Windows.
[00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:06.760]   That was the answer that the EU came up with.
[00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:08.080]   I feel like it's very difficult.
[00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:12.760]   Of course, the 1998 Justice Department went on and on, cost a lot of money.
[00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:14.880]   I don't know if it accomplished anything at all.
[00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:20.600]   Microsoft managed to become less of a monopoly all on its own.
[00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:24.000]   Any thoughts on what the EU is up to?
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.040]   Oh, EU.
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:27.040]   Oh, EU.
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:34.000]   I mean, I can kind of see their points.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.120]   You get your Android phone and it has maps.
[00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:39.200]   It has, you know, it's just what consumers want, right?
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:41.280]   Yeah, but it's kind of what you want.
[00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:43.480]   And then you're like, "Oh, well, it has a Google Play."
[00:50:43.480 --> 00:50:45.960]   You're like, "Oh, well, let's put a third party.
[00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:48.480]   You know, let's give the third party is an opportunity to put their store on there."
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:50.560]   And I'm like, "I don't think that's a good idea."
[00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:51.560]   No.
[00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:56.600]   I'm all beyond the Amazon app store.
[00:50:56.600 --> 00:51:03.160]   My concern is, you know, random third parties with their app stores and malware.
[00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:04.160]   That's it.
[00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:05.800]   That's my...
[00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:07.840]   You've introduced more malware into the EU.
[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:09.480]   Good job, guys.
[00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:13.640]   This is what they object to requiring manufacturers to pre-install Google Search and Google's
[00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:16.040]   Chrome browser.
[00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:17.400]   You're not required to do that again.
[00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:18.480]   It's open source software.
[00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:21.520]   You don't have to, but if you're going to put Google services on there, you have to
[00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:24.000]   at least do search and browser.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:28.080]   You're going to set Google searches as the default service.
[00:51:28.080 --> 00:51:34.200]   That's how you get the other apps preventing manufacturers from selling other operating
[00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:36.400]   systems based on the open source code.
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:41.920]   Once you're part of this consortium running official Google Android, you can't do an
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:47.040]   AOSP version and giving financial incentives to manufacturers and mobile network operators
[00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:51.920]   on condition that they exclusively install Google Search and then devices.
[00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:57.960]   Basically, this whole complaint really started because Microsoft and other Google competitors,
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:52:04.760]   including the French search engine, which no one can remember or use, complained.
[00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:06.520]   They're competitors.
[00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:09.040]   They didn't like it.
[00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:12.560]   Now Microsoft is, by the way, Microsoft and Google have agreed to bury the hatchet.
[00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:15.480]   They're going to stop complaining about each other.
[00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:18.280]   It only took two hours.
[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:19.280]   For now.
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:20.280]   Yeah.
[00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:22.280]   For a week or two.
[00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:27.240]   It's got to be frustrating because my reaction would be, "Okay, well fine.
[00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:29.160]   Then I won't give you Google Search, but bye.
[00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:30.600]   See you later, EU."
[00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:31.600]   Right.
[00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:32.600]   Right.
[00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:33.600]   But then you can't do that.
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:34.600]   But that would be my reaction.
[00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:35.920]   It's like, "Well, you don't like us.
[00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:37.560]   That's what I would have done to the right to be forgotten."
[00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:38.560]   Okay, fine.
[00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:40.040]   No Google Search for you.
[00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:46.720]   I think if you want to give, give me a manufacturer the option to put a forked version of Android
[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:47.720]   seems fine.
[00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:51.160]   If there's a forked version of Android that Samsung--
[00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:52.160]   Well, let's say you're Amazon.
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:56.720]   And this is one of the reasons-- I mean, actually, I wonder Amazon had the fire phone.
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:53:00.600]   Oh, no, fire was not-- it was not-- didn't have Google services on it, did it?
[00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:02.440]   No, another stuff ever has.
[00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:05.000]   By the way, that sold really well, didn't it?
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:06.520]   It was a huge hit.
[00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:07.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:07.520 --> 00:53:09.000]   The Kindle, the Kindle, though--
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:10.160]   I think it's made the profit.
[00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:11.160]   The Kindle's do okay.
[00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:13.840]   The fire is-- the fire tablets do okay.
[00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:14.840]   But they're not--
[00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:15.840]   You got phones.
[00:53:15.840 --> 00:53:16.840]   Yeah.
[00:53:16.840 --> 00:53:19.160]   No, that's the thing.
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:23.640]   You can get away with it not having Google Maps on your tablet, even though it does become
[00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:24.640]   a little annoying.
[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:26.400]   But you can't have a phone.
[00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:28.800]   And that was-- it's what I said when the fire phone first launched.
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:31.400]   It was like, how are they going to launch a phone without Google Maps?
[00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:33.560]   Like, genuinely, how is that going to work?
[00:53:33.560 --> 00:53:35.640]   And it didn't work.
[00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:37.320]   So that's not Google's fault.
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:39.280]   That's the market weighing in.
[00:53:39.280 --> 00:53:40.280]   Right.
[00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:44.360]   I mean, in Amazon, you know, their issue is a little bit more deep rooted.
[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:49.280]   I mean, they may even make it so that if you want to install the Amazon App Store or Amazon
[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:53.040]   video apps on your Android devices, you know, you can't get them from Google Play.
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:56.800]   You have to go to Amazon.com and sideload them and install them that way.
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:04.400]   So they have-- I feel like their issues are deeper and more at stake than some of these,
[00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:08.240]   you know, AOSP complaints that the EU might be talking about.
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:11.600]   But yeah, I mean, I feel like it's one of those things.
[00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:14.760]   I mean, this is what you get for making an agreement with Google.
[00:54:14.760 --> 00:54:19.160]   If you want to get all the benefits of Android, proper Android, Google Android, then you've
[00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:21.240]   got to, you know, have their search there.
[00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:26.520]   I mean, that was something that when we first saw Android come to market, that we saw from
[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:29.800]   the carriers, you know, I think it was Verizon who had the deal with Bing so that you would
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:34.560]   get like a Moto Droid, you'd get a-- you'd get a Droid, and it wouldn't have Google search
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:35.560]   on it.
[00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:38.720]   You know, that was like the flagship Android phone, and it had these other things on it.
[00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:42.040]   And Google very quickly kind of realized, oh, wait, wait, wait, if we don't put these
[00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:47.160]   provisions in place, then the big things that we are creating this operating system for
[00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:50.240]   and giving it away for free for, you know, to be able to get more information, more data
[00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:55.800]   from users and be able to more, you know, heuristically build models about how, you know, predictive
[00:54:55.800 --> 00:55:01.040]   stuff works and get this information and target users with their advertising won't exist anymore.
[00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:03.480]   So it's kind of a push pull.
[00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:07.040]   But I kind of wonder, I mean, it's interesting that this is happening now.
[00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:10.160]   It's like where have you guys been for the last, you know, eight, nine years?
[00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:11.160]   I see.
[00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:13.680]   Because this has always been part of the trade-off.
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:18.080]   There's kind of a bitter irony in this, though, because if Google hadn't offered a free version
[00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:23.320]   of Android, hadn't made Android open source, hadn't created AOSP, they wouldn't-- I mean,
[00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:28.000]   Apple doesn't do any of that and is not being challenged because an iPhone has a, you know,
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:29.760]   an iPhone is an iPhone.
[00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:30.760]   And so Apple is--
[00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:33.400]   Well, but they're the only one who makes an iPhone.
[00:55:33.400 --> 00:55:34.400]   Right.
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:37.200]   And it's different if you had other companies who would make iPhone.
[00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:42.240]   So they got hoisted by being more open and more-- and Apple doesn't have to worry because
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:45.480]   they just-- of course, Apple does not have the market dominance.
[00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:47.400]   Yeah, they don't have 80% of the market.
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:48.400]   Right.
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:50.480]   It's that market share that they're concerned about.
[00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:51.480]   Right.
[00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:54.520]   I mean, it's partially market share, but it's also, you know, it's the collaboration of
[00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:55.800]   hardware and software.
[00:55:55.800 --> 00:56:00.680]   And if you are working with other companies, it becomes dicey under EU legislation to say
[00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:05.480]   to other companies, "No, you're only allowed to use our software or our specific things
[00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:08.080]   or else you, you know, you miss out."
[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:10.880]   Like, that's a dangerous precedent to set.
[00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:13.840]   And it's-- I mean, as we've talked about with Microsoft, it's something that's come
[00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:14.840]   up before.
[00:56:14.840 --> 00:56:19.360]   Apple scirts around it not only because they don't necessarily have the market share,
[00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:24.040]   but even if Apple had 80% of the market share, I don't think the EU is going to come place
[00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:29.800]   the hammer down on Apple because their hardware that they make runs their software that they
[00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:30.640]   make.
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:31.640]   I don't know.
[00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:37.000]   I think the EU would be, if Apple had 80% of the market, they were like, "You need to
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.160]   license your software to other manufacturers."
[00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:40.160]   Really?
[00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:41.160]   I could see that as an op-it.
[00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:43.000]   I could see someone like, "I mean, how the woodwork?"
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   And saying, "You know what?
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:48.040]   You need to make iOS available for Samsung for other people."
[00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:49.040]   No.
[00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:52.240]   Maybe not having 80% of the market share is pretty good.
[00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:55.720]   But honestly, that does sound like an EU thing that does sound like something that you
[00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:56.720]   would have.
[00:56:56.720 --> 00:56:57.720]   Yeah.
[00:56:57.720 --> 00:56:58.720]   It really does.
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:56:59.720]   I'm not saying it's logical.
[00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:01.480]   I'm just saying that's something I could see.
[00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:06.200]   It really feels like the EU just doesn't like a big company.
[00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:08.520]   We just don't want you to get that big and powerful.
[00:57:08.520 --> 00:57:12.960]   They did make Apple switch to what micro USB for the USB.
[00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:13.960]   They did.
[00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:14.960]   They did.
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:16.720]   They made them include those things in the box.
[00:57:16.720 --> 00:57:17.720]   Right on.
[00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:21.640]   They still have a lightning force where they make them put that box down.
[00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:22.640]   Right on.
[00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:23.640]   Yeah, they made a rule.
[00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:25.920]   It wasn't specifically aimed at Apple, but they made a rule that all smartphones had
[00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:26.920]   to have micro USB.
[00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:27.920]   It was?
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:28.920]   It was totally real.
[00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:33.440]   Well, but remember, you remember the days when an Nokia phone, even different Nokia
[00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:34.440]   phones had different chargers.
[00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:39.840]   The micro USB was a lifesaver.
[00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:41.400]   The different chargers were the worst.
[00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:42.400]   That was a dark time.
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:45.400]   Well, that's the world we're in with laptops, right?
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:48.360]   Every laptop has a unique charger.
[00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:51.880]   I look forward to the day when everybody's type C. That's why I really celebrated the
[00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:52.880]   Mac book.
[00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:57.400]   I thought, "Wow, Apple's giving up the huge amount of money they make on selling mag safe
[00:57:57.400 --> 00:58:01.160]   adapters for 10 times the cost."
[00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:02.160]   Wow.
[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:05.440]   Well, now they're USB-C on the Mac book.
[00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:06.440]   Right.
[00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:09.320]   I thought that was a shocker to me that Apple was willing to do that.
[00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:10.920]   I'd love to see USB-C everywhere.
[00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:20.280]   Although, apparently, the quick charge devices, HTC 10 and the LG 5, which use USB-C and Qualcomm's
[00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:25.040]   quick charge are out of compliance with USB-C.
[00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:26.360]   They're over-voltage.
[00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:28.880]   You can only go so high.
[00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:32.520]   Qualcomm says, "Well, we don't tell them that they...
[00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:36.760]   It's up to them how much voltage they want to use."
[00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:43.040]   People like Benson Leung, who's been the staunch defender of the USB-C, spec to make sure that
[00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:49.640]   it doesn't burn out things like your Mac book, point out this is not in compliance.
[00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:55.720]   You could plug in an HTC 10 to your Mac book and withdraw too much power.
[00:58:55.720 --> 00:58:57.480]   You could hurt your Mac book.
[00:58:57.480 --> 00:59:00.920]   I mean, yeah, it's not a good situation.
[00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:05.720]   Even I suspect Apple has some precautions built in there to the charging point or just
[00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:06.720]   to prevent it.
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:07.720]   I would hope so.
[00:59:07.720 --> 00:59:08.720]   Yeah.
[00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:09.720]   Well, I mean, it's Apple.
[00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:10.720]   They think about these things.
[00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:13.080]   But some other laptop manufacturers, not so much.
[00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:20.240]   We've heard a lot about USB-C's relative flakiness when it comes to chargers.
[00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:23.440]   Still celebrated and I want it on everything.
[00:59:23.440 --> 00:59:24.760]   I hope Apple continues with that.
[00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:25.760]   I don't know if they will.
[00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:28.800]   It's the only way you could do one port though, right?
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:30.880]   You could have done that with MagSafe.
[00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:34.040]   If you're going to do one port, you have to be data as well as power.
[00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:42.000]   Although I will say that USB-C adapter connector that turns your USB-C port into a magnetic
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:43.760]   connection, I forget who it was.
[00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:44.760]   Like that?
[00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:45.920]   Who showed it off at CES.
[00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:46.920]   I love the idea.
[00:59:46.920 --> 00:59:48.920]   I haven't seen it in practice yet.
[00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:49.920]   I haven't either.
[00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:50.920]   Yeah, I think it was Belkin.
[00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:53.760]   So it pulls off, just like the MagSafe does.
[00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:56.160]   If you trip against it, it pulls off.
[00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:57.160]   Is that it?
[00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:58.160]   Yeah.
[00:59:58.160 --> 00:59:59.160]   I know.
[00:59:59.160 --> 01:00:02.240]   I've sent my light laptops like the former Quick Air.
[01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:05.000]   I've sent it flying so many times.
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.760]   Or rather, I would have sent it flying.
[01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:10.960]   How many times will tell you no roller skates in the living room?
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:12.960]   But it's hard.
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:13.960]   It's hard.
[01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:16.560]   Are you back in roller derby?
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:17.560]   Did you get back in it?
[01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:18.560]   I am.
[01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:19.560]   I am skating in Providence.
[01:00:19.560 --> 01:00:20.760]   Providence roller derby.
[01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:21.760]   I was actually...
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:22.760]   I thought I saw pictures.
[01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:28.440]   Below the waist I am covered in red paint because we did a fundraiser called Gourd for
[01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:29.440]   Good today.
[01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:30.440]   Oh dear.
[01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:31.440]   Yeah, there's a 3K.
[01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:34.360]   So we all dressed up as roller bowls with horns.
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:35.960]   You can see it on my Instagram.
[01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:36.960]   And we Gourd.
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:41.400]   We like slapped runners with red paint as they ran by to raise money for a homeless charity
[01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:42.400]   in Providence.
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:43.400]   I grew up in Providence.
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:44.400]   I grew up in Providence.
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:45.400]   120.
[01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:46.400]   Did you really?
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:47.400]   Yeah.
[01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:48.400]   Is that where you live now?
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:49.400]   Yeah, well, in that general area.
[01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:50.400]   I love Providence.
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:51.400]   My mom lives in Cranston.
[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:52.400]   Oh, really?
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:53.400]   That's awesome.
[01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:54.400]   Yeah.
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:55.720]   Yeah, it's my new hood.
[01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:56.720]   I really like it.
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:58.120]   It's right near Boston.
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:00:59.120]   It's only an hour.
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:00.120]   It is.
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:01.120]   It is.
[01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:02.120]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:03.120]   I always...
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:07.400]   Yeah, so I don't live in Providence proper, but it became too far of a drive to go to Boston
[01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:08.400]   roller derby.
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:09.400]   So I'm with Providence.
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:10.400]   Nice.
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:13.400]   I recognize the deciduous...
[01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:15.400]   Well, doesn't your fiance live down there?
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:16.400]   Yeah.
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:17.400]   That's why.
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:18.400]   Yeah.
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:19.400]   So when we moved in, yeah.
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:20.400]   Yeah.
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:21.400]   Yeah.
[01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:36.080]   We moved in to the
[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:37.080]   front.
[01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:38.080]   Yeah.
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:39.080]   Yeah.
[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:40.080]   I'm going to go to the front.
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:41.080]   I'm going to go to the front.
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:42.080]   I'm going to go to the front.
[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:43.080]   I'm going to go to the front.
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:44.080]   I'm going to go to the front.
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:45.080]   I'm going to go to the front.
[01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:46.080]   I'm going to go to the front.
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:47.080]   I'm going to go to the front.
[01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:48.080]   I'm going to go to the front.
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:49.080]   I'm going to go to the front.
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:50.080]   I'm going to go to the front.
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:51.080]   I'm going to go to the front.
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:52.080]   I'm going to go to the front.
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:53.080]   I'm going to go to the front.
[01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:54.080]   I'm going to go to the front.
[01:01:54.080 --> 01:01:55.080]   I'm going to go to the front.
[01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:56.080]   I'm going to go to the front.
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:57.080]   I'm going to go to the front.
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:04.080]   I'm going to go to the front.
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:07.080]   I'm going to go to the front.
[01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:08.080]   I'm going to go to the front.
[01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:09.080]   I'm going to go to the front.
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:10.080]   I'm going to go to the front.
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:11.080]   I'm going to go to the front.
[01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:12.080]   I'm going to go to the front.
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:13.080]   I'm going to go to the front.
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:14.080]   I'm going to go to the front.
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:15.080]   I'm going to go to the front.
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:16.080]   I'm going to go to the front.
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:17.080]   I'm going to go to the front.
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:18.080]   I'm going to go to the front.
[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:19.080]   I'm going to go to the front.
[01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:20.080]   I'm going to go to the front.
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:21.080]   I'm going to go to the front.
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:22.080]   I'm going to go to the front.
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:23.080]   I'm going to go to the front.
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:24.080]   I'm going to go to the front.
[01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:25.080]   I'm going to go to the front.
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:26.080]   I'm going to go to the front.
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:27.080]   I'm going to go to the front.

[01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:29.080]   It's been a terrible year for great, great people.
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:30.080]   You know what's sad to me?
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:32.080]   Is there all my age?
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:34.080]   That's what really scares me.
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:35.080]   Our share.
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:36.080]   There's a poor goes away.
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:37.080]   I'm going to be really sad.
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:38.080]   It's all sad.
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:41.080]   We had a great, hey, by the way, we had a great week.
[01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:44.080]   We have a best of, I think, from the week just passed,
[01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:46.080]   and then we'll talk a little bit about what's coming up.
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:49.080]   It's going to be a big week on Twitch.
[01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:51.080]   Watch.
[01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:52.080]   On Twitch.
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:54.080]   Hello and welcome to the Twitch.
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:59.080]   Live Special at NAB, the National Association of Broadcasters Show.
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:01.080]   We're here with the entire team.
[01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:04.080]   If you are in content creation, if you are a broadcaster,
[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:08.080]   if you at all love the process of creating, of imagining
[01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:12.080]   and bringing it to the screen, then well, this was the place to be.
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:14.080]   Twitch Live Specials.
[01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:16.080]   We are surrounded by cameras here at the Z Cam booth.
[01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:20.080]   We actually synchronized all 48 cameras in a very precise manner.
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:21.080]   Well, it's time.
[01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:23.080]   And then we can come up with a boot of time like effects.
[01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:27.080]   This matrix-looking squint-like device, you tell me,
[01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:29.080]   is actually the perfect VR system.
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:32.080]   This is the first camera that we really use that just feels like
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:34.080]   a production camera for live.
[01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:36.080]   iOS today.
[01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:40.080]   I want to show you guys an app called Rico Live's Multi-cam.
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:41.080]   So it's the camera on the iPad?
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:42.080]   Right.
[01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:44.080]   But what's even cooler is I've got Megan on the same network,
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:47.080]   so I'm going to tap here in the bottom right of chose Megan's iPad
[01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:48.080]   with Taylor.
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:51.080]   So you're doing a multi-camera shoot with iPads?
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:53.080]   It's a $5 app, please.
[01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:54.080]   $5.
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:55.080]   $5.
[01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:56.080]   Triangulation.
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:58.080]   Our guest, I'm thrilled to have a Matthew Wood supervising
[01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:00.080]   sound editor at Skywalker Sound.
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:02.080]   Give us a little general, Peter.
[01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:06.080]   I've been turning to your Jedi honors by Count Dooku.
[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:08.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:09.080]   Twitter.
[01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:10.080]   I'm your father.
[01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:12.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:14.080]   But he's actually general grievous, Jim.
[01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:16.080]   That's the difference.
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:17.080]   That was a lot of fun.
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:19.080]   If you didn't see that triangulation with Matthew Wood,
[01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:21.080]   it was really good.
[01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:25.080]   He has edited all the Star Wars movies, including the most recent one.
[01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:29.080]   He is a sound editor and just a remarkable fellow and young.
[01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:32.080]   And he's a Wood supervising Skywalker for 20, 60 years.
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:34.080]   He got the job when he was 17.
[01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:35.080]   Big week coming up.
[01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:37.080]   Jason Howell has the latest.
[01:05:37.080 --> 01:05:38.080]   Hey, thanks, Leo.
[01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:41.080]   Here's a look at a few things we're going to be watching in the upcoming week first.
[01:05:41.080 --> 01:05:43.080]   It's earnings, Palooza.
[01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:46.080]   There's Apple, Twitter, Facebook, Nintendo, LinkedIn, Sony Corp.
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:48.080]   Honestly, this is just naming a few.
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:51.080]   There's definitely going to be more nuggets falling out of those trees.
[01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:52.080]   So we'll keep an eye on that.
[01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:58.080]   Also, Samsung is holding its developer conference in San Francisco, April 27th through 28th,
[01:05:58.080 --> 01:06:05.080]   with a focus on mobile, the Internet of Things, and of course, what Samsung event would be complete
[01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:07.080]   without virtual reality in there.
[01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:12.080]   And speaking of VR, the third annual Silicon Valley virtual reality conference and Expo
[01:06:12.080 --> 01:06:15.080]   happens April 27th through 29th as well.
[01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:20.080]   That's touted as the world's largest professional conference for consumer virtual reality.
[01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:23.080]   We have a few kind of product-y things happening.
[01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:28.080]   On the 27th, the Kindle Oasis begins shipping to reading maniacs everywhere.
[01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:34.080]   And starting May 1st, Google begins to retire Picasa for good, with migration to Google
[01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:36.080]   Photos kicking into gear.
[01:06:36.080 --> 01:06:40.080]   Mega Moroni and I will be following these and a whole lot more on Tech News today, all week,
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:44.080]   starting at 4PM Pacific, 7PM Eastern at twit.tv/live.
[01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:46.080]   That's a look at the week ahead.
[01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:47.080]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:48.080]   Thank you, Jason.
[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:50.080]   It was a really fun week at NAB this week.
[01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:53.080]   We could talk a little bit more about some of the things we saw in just a moment.
[01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:56.080]   Our show today brought to you by BrainTree.
[01:06:56.080 --> 01:07:02.080]   If you're a mobile app developer, the last thing you want to do is write your own payment system.
[01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:05.080]   Please, please do not write your own payment system.
[01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:08.080]   Security issues, it's a lot of work.
[01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:11.080]   And there's a much better choice out there.
[01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:13.080]   BrainTree payments.
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:17.080]   Whatever the payment system your customers want, BrainTree has it.

[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:23.080]   They've got it all.
[01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:28.080]   And when the next big thing comes along, all you got to do is check a box in the control panel
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:29.080]   and your app will have it too.
[01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:31.080]   It's a full stack payment platform.
[01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:34.080]   Easily adapted to whatever the future holds.
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:36.080]   You get it all in a secure fashion.
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:38.080]   These guys are the kings.
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:41.080]   They're the ones behind Pinterest's buyable pins you see everywhere.
[01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:45.080]   They're the ones behind the payments on Uber and Lyft.
[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:46.080]   They do it all.
[01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:48.080]   Airbnb and hotels tonight.
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:50.080]   GitHub uses BrainTree.
[01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:54.080]   Except anything from pounds to PayPal to that next big thing.

[01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:05.080]   So you can use it on the web too.
[01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:09.080]   In .NET, in Node.js, in Java, in Pearl and PHP, and Python, in Ruby,
[01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:11.080]   it's BrainTree.

[01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:23.080]   We're talking about the week's tech news.
[01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:27.080]   Joining us, Serenity Caldwell from imore.com.
[01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:28.080]   Great to have you.
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:29.080]   Great to be.
[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:33.080]   Yeah, Christina Warren from Mashable and from Engadget.
[01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:35.080]   It's Roberto Baldwin.
[01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:38.080]   We're talking about the week's news.
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:40.080]   What are you laughing at?
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:44.080]   I wasn't smiling the last time we did the line up, so I felt like I had to do something nice.
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:46.080]   Did you have a cheesy?
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:51.080]   I mean, this is just cheesy to begin with, so I just kind of amped it up.
[01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:52.080]   Good looking man.
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:54.080]   No, you're a fine looking fella.
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:57.080]   You got that Kirk Douglas chin thing.
[01:08:57.080 --> 01:08:59.080]   I have the super chin.
[01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:01.080]   I can hold things between my chin and my lip.
[01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:03.080]   Damn, I always wanted that.
[01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:04.080]   Hold on, hold on.
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:07.080]   Can you hold an apple pencil between the chin and my lip?
[01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:09.080]   Oh, this is too slippery.
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:11.080]   I have this whole ear.
[01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:12.080]   I could hold it.
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:13.080]   Oh, dear.
[01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:15.080]   I should go get a pencil.
[01:09:15.080 --> 01:09:16.080]   Boy.
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:18.080]   How do we get to this?
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:19.080]   How did this happen?
[01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:21.080]   A billion art supplies down here.
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:22.080]   Hold on.
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:24.080]   But are your legs red?
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:26.080]   No.
[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:28.080]   Amazon, this was, I saw this article.
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:31.080]   I thought, wow, this is really interesting.
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:41.080]   And Christie, who is a Navy commander by day and writes romances at night, wrote an interesting
[01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:46.080]   article about scammers on the Kindle Unlimited.
[01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:50.080]   So Kindle Unlimited is your subscription, you know, your Netflix for books.
[01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:51.080]   I keep getting tempted.
[01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:52.080]   I haven't yet done it.
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:54.080]   Did anybody use Kindle Unlimited?
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:55.080]   I did.
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:10:00.080]   And I forgot to subscribe here for a number of months and then I have like, unsubscribed.
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:01.080]   It was fine.
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:03.080]   Because he never used it.
[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:08.080]   I never used it because the problem is they've got some good books, but a lot of the selection
[01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:10.080]   is kind of like what Netflix was in its early years.
[01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:13.080]   You know, where you have some limited, it's pretty fairly bad.
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:18.080]   If there's an author, if there's like, you know, if, and Christie, you know, and you're a big
[01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:21.080]   Ann Christie fan, you can read all of her books, then that would be worth it.
[01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:22.080]   Right.
[01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:23.080]   It's a monthly fee.
[01:10:23.080 --> 01:10:28.080]   So what's interesting is how authors get paid.
[01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:32.600]   And until Christie wrote about it, I had no idea.
[01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:38.920]   So the theory is that all the money that goes into Kindle Unlimited goes into a communal
[01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:44.040]   pot, which is divided up not based on the price of the book, but the number of pages.
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:45.840]   This seems very equitable, right?
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:51.000]   If you write a great page turner of 500 pages, you get more than if somebody writes a book
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.120]   and only 20 pages are read, right?
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:56.440]   You get paid per page in effect.
[01:10:56.440 --> 01:11:03.320]   But there are scammers and apparently there are thousands of books on Kindle Unlimited,
[01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:07.680]   where the book is when an iPod, right?
[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:15.480]   And it, what happens is you on the first page, it says, okay, jump to page 3000.
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:21.120]   And it turns out the way the pages are counted is not sequentially, but just the farthest
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:23.880]   page anybody got to in the book.
[01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:24.880]   Oh, no.
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:27.200]   These scammers, you go, oh, I'm on page one.
[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:31.920]   Okay, jump to 3000 to win my iPod, which of course nobody ever wins.
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:39.960]   Now Amazon says, oh, wow, they read 3000 pages and that scammer gets that much more of the
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:40.960]   pot per page.
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:46.760]   It comes into about, according to Christie, a buck 57 for a 350 page book.
[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:50.560]   That means like $15 for a 3000 page book.
[01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:53.760]   That's a big chunk of change.
[01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:56.320]   So what a huge scam.
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:58.160]   I didn't know about this.
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:11:59.240]   Hey, it's a scam.
[01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:01.880]   B, I want to write a choose your own adventure book.
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:02.880]   I know.
[01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:03.880]   It's tempting.
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:06.760]   And then now the first, the first choice is like two pages at the end of the book and
[01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:09.360]   then you just kind of have them going back and forth.
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:10.360]   It's right.
[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:13.680]   As long as I hit that last page, I'm, I'm in the gold.
[01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:15.200]   So now I'm quitting my job.
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:16.200]   I know.
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:19.360]   I haven't seen a response from Amazon, but I would guess.
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:23.720]   And one of the reasons I'm giving this blog post some publicity, I would guess that once
[01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:27.600]   they hear about this, they're going to do something because that's not fair.
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:28.600]   I sure hope so.
[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:29.600]   That's not fair.
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:31.240]   I mean, she, I'm looking at this blog post now.
[01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:35.560]   I mean, she was saying that one of the scammers actually created a YouTube tutorial about
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:36.560]   how this work.
[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:38.320]   How to make a scam book.
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:42.440]   And it showed that this person made like $70,000 in one month.
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:47.040]   I mean, and it's crazy because this reminds you of like the early AdSense scams, you know,
[01:12:47.040 --> 01:12:50.520]   from like, like 12, 13 years ago.
[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:53.880]   But you would think that, I mean, you could sort of understand how that happened in the
[01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:58.240]   early days of, of online ads and how people could, could, you know, scan the system that
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:12:59.240]   way.
[01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:02.400]   But you would think that Amazon, if you're going to have a system like this, that you
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:04.720]   would have provisions in place that would prevent this from happening.
[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:06.160]   Like this just seems so obvious.
[01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:10.360]   It's disappointing that they, that they didn't foresee that obviously this would be the sort
[01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:11.920]   of the bad coding.
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:12.920]   It's bad coding.
[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:13.920]   It's a coding emission.
[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:14.920]   I honestly think that.
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:17.680]   Remember, remember the Kindle is not very powerful.
[01:13:17.680 --> 01:13:20.360]   You can't like, it's not going to sit and watch you turn the pages.
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:22.280]   It's kind of a way to make that work.
[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:23.280]   But there's.
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:26.080]   I mean, whisper sync is telling you where you are.
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:31.320]   If you go from like one to like 700, I'm still holding a pencil, by the way.
[01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:32.880]   Go ahead and put it on your chin.
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:33.880]   Just put it in your chin.
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:34.880]   Let's see.
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:35.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:37.680]   There you go.
[01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:39.680]   There's the album art for the show.
[01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:40.680]   There we go.
[01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:41.680]   Sorry, Roberta.
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:42.680]   You win.
[01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:46.880]   By the way, I think you're going to also get the title of the show.
[01:13:46.880 --> 01:13:52.680]   You know, you're going to, this is, you get a perfecta here, a trifecta.
[01:13:52.680 --> 01:13:54.560]   It's Robbie's special hour.
[01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:56.200]   Robbie's special hour.
[01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:57.200]   I'm sorry, everyone.
[01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:00.120]   It's like I'm wasting an hour.
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:01.120]   Everyone's talking about that.
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:02.120]   No, you're not.
[01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:03.120]   No, people love it.
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:05.920]   They, you know, it's so funny because people really don't want us to talk about news.
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:08.040]   They want us to entertain them.
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:10.440]   The news is just the spine.
[01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:11.440]   We can do both.
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:12.440]   I know.
[01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:14.080]   We can be informative and entertaining.
[01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:16.080]   I think that's the goal here.
[01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:23.080]   It's a very fun, and it's a very fun, and it's a very fun, and it's a very fun, and it's
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:29.080]   a very fun, and it's a very fun, and it's a very fun, and it's a very fun, and it's a
[01:14:29.080 --> 01:14:34.080]   very fun, and it's a very fun, and it's a very fun, and it's a very fun, and it's a
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:39.080]   very fun, and it's a very fun, and it's a very fun, and it's a very fun, and it's a
[01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:43.080]   very fun, and it's a very fun, and it's a very fun, and it's a very fun, and it's a
[01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:45.080]   fun, and it's a very fun, and it's a very fun, and it's a very fun, and it's a very fun,
[01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:47.080]   and it's a very fun, and it's a very fun, and it's a very fun, and it's a very fun,
[01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:52.080]   and it's a very fun, and it's a very fun, and it's a very fun, and it's a very fun,
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:55.080]   and it's a very fun, and it's a very fun, and it's a very fun, and it's a very fun,
[01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:59.080]   and it's a very fun, and it's a very fun, and it's a very fun, and it's a very fun,
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:03.080]   and it's a very fun, and it's a very fun, and it's a very fun, and it's a very fun,
[01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:07.080]   and it's a very fun, and it's a very fun, and it's a very fun, and it's a very fun,
[01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:11.080]   and it's a very fun, and it's a very fun, and it's a very fun, and it's a very fun,
[01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:17.080]   amazing. They do an autopsy on you, and you've got purple in your lungs. That can't be good.
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:23.080]   He was just coughing up a rainbow. We don't know what happened. We thought it was a Snapchat filter.
[01:15:23.080 --> 01:15:29.080]   I don't know. So this is like an event. This color run is an event.
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:36.080]   They're going through Queens in a couple of weeks, if anybody wants to run out there.
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:42.080]   I see we can go to San Jose and to the May. Kids today, they'll do anything. Anyway, we're
[01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:48.080]   was like, oh, I just learned today. I learned Uber drivers don't get tips.
[01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:56.080]   Yeah. Didn't they imply that part of the deal on Uber was the tips built in?
[01:15:56.080 --> 01:16:02.080]   Okay, so they did like five years ago, and then they stopped implying that once it was apparent,
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:06.080]   oh, no, actually, what they used to do is in the early days of Uber, as I recall,
[01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:10.080]   some of the language kind of implied that the money that you didn't need to tip your driver
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:14.080]   because the payment you gave included some sort of a trap.
[01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:18.080]   But they got rid of that language probably four years ago.
[01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:22.080]   Lyft does let you tip if you're done, but yeah, you're right.
[01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:26.080]   That was something I think for early Uber users that we were kind of bought in a year.
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:30.080]   So now I feel like a total jerk because I've been getting out of the car going,
[01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:34.080]   thanks, see you later. Never tipping anybody.
[01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:38.080]   Well, they don't have a way for you to tip in the app.
[01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:40.080]   No, you have to throw a 20 at them or something.
[01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:44.080]   Right, which I'm going to be honest with you. Part of the reason I use Uber is because I don't carry cash,
[01:16:44.080 --> 01:16:46.080]   so that's sort of a problem.
[01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:48.080]   And a lot of times the drivers won't take them either.
[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:52.080]   Well, they will now because apparently get ready, they're going to put signs in the
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:56.080]   in the Ubers saying, I don't receive tips, please tip me.
[01:16:56.080 --> 01:17:00.080]   And this is part of the settlement that Uber just made.
[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:02.080]   The settlement of $100 million.
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:04.080]   Yeah.
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:08.080]   Uber can't yell at the driver for doing that.
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:10.080]   Lyft has it in the app, right?
[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:11.080]   Yes.
[01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:12.080]   And Uber.
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:13.080]   And Uber.
[01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:14.080]   Yeah.
[01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:16.080]   Because you don't have to tip a ton.
[01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:18.080]   I mean, you can just give a dollar or two, you know, I mean,
[01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:20.080]   because they're still getting one of their cut-its from the thing.
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:22.080]   And then you feel good about that.
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:25.080]   I always just feel weird because like with a cab, you know, like 20%,
[01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:27.080]   I can just like get 20%.
[01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:28.080]   I always give them 20%.
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:29.080]   Yeah.
[01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:30.080]   Same.
[01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:33.080]   But if I'm being totally honest, and this is where I feel like a terrible person,
[01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:36.080]   but I'm admitting that's on the Internet, so this is going to haunt me.
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:39.080]   I don't know if I would always want to tip 20%
[01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:45.080]   for those of you listening, we're zooming in.
[01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:46.080]   Here's to me.
[01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:48.080]   I'm like, yep, very slow.
[01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:53.080]   I want to tip 20% in a Lyft or Uber because then it would be more expensive
[01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:54.080]   than a cab and that defeats the purpose.
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:18:00.080]   That's exactly why Uber refuses to update their software to include a tip button.
[01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:02.080]   But I would give a few dollars.
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:03.080]   I would do that.
[01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:05.080]   I'm just not saying I would always give like 20%.
[01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:08.080]   You know, there's a place at my local cafe.
[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:13.080]   They have like a pseudo square that I think is run on Samsung and it flips over
[01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:16.080]   and it says, what would you like to tip?
[01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:18.080]   Five, ten, fifteen or twenty percent?
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:19.080]   Yeah.
[01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:21.080]   And then it shows it on those various things.
[01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:25.080]   And granted, I think that's a way to guilt yourself into paying 20.
[01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:27.080]   I'm not going to do the bottom.
[01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:33.080]   I don't want to be a super stingy person, but that might be a good way of just like Uber.
[01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:36.080]   How or or tie tipping to rating?
[01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:39.080]   Maybe I feel like that would get messy fast.
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:40.080]   Yeah.
[01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:43.080]   Because like there's some situations where it's like,
[01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:46.080]   and here's the thing, like for a shorter trip, I might tip more.
[01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:47.080]   You know what I mean?
[01:18:47.080 --> 01:18:50.080]   Like if it's like a five dollar ride, I might be like, here's three dollars
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:52.080]   because that's usually what I do in a cab.
[01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:57.080]   But like if it's like a fifty dollar ride, I don't want to be a twenty percent on a
[01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:58.080]   fifty dollar ride.
[01:18:58.080 --> 01:18:59.080]   Yeah.
[01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:00.080]   Yeah.
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:02.080]   But I also feel I do.
[01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:03.080]   Yeah.
[01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:04.080]   I feel terrible.
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:05.080]   I feel terrible.
[01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:09.080]   I have so many feelings about the sharing economy and finally.
[01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:13.080]   I feel terrible because I assumed they were getting tipped and I never tipped.
[01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:14.080]   Yeah.
[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:16.080]   Now I feel like I've been a jerk this whole time.
[01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:17.080]   Yeah.
[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:21.080]   So we can think they could just raise the prices and build a tip into it.
[01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:24.080]   And I think that that would be okay.
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:26.080]   Uber made me feel like a jerk.
[01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:27.080]   Yeah.
[01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:30.080]   I'm taking lift from now on except those stupid mustaches are even jerkier.
[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:36.080]   At least now we had the little electronic mustaches and not like on the front.
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:39.080]   I found out, you know what, I just found out and I'm also shagrind about this.
[01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:42.080]   It's my cousin who invented the giant pink mustache.
[01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:45.080]   Yes, David Eilers.
[01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:46.080]   He's the guy.
[01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:47.080]   David Eilers is the guy.
[01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:48.080]   He's my cousin.
[01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:51.080]   He's the guy who's responsible for stunts.
[01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:52.080]   Yeah.
[01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:53.080]   Or is it Ethan?
[01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:54.080]   It's David or Ethan.
[01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:55.080]   I can't remember which one.
[01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:57.080]   He's responsible for stunts.
[01:19:57.080 --> 01:19:58.080]   Well, they're brothers.
[01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:00.080]   It's one of the other.
[01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:03.080]   At, at, at, at, at lift.
[01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:11.080]   He's the guy who came up with not only the pink mustache, but the April Fool's prank
[01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:12.080]   Uber lifts.
[01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:13.080]   Oh.
[01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:14.080]   Do you know about those?
[01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:15.080]   No.
[01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:18.640]   I tried to ignore those things.
[01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:22.080]   I have never ridden in a lift because I feel like it's going to be some guy in his toy
[01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:23.080]   after school.
[01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:25.080]   Oh, well, they used to be.
[01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:26.080]   Yeah.
[01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:28.080]   This is one of the early days.
[01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:29.080]   This is the early days.
[01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:30.080]   It's Ethan.
[01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:31.080]   Not David.
[01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:32.080]   It's Ethan.
[01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:35.080]   In the early days, how lift worked is it was honestly, I was not a fan.
[01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:36.080]   They were like, sit in the front.
[01:20:36.080 --> 01:20:37.080]   Do a fist bump.
[01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:39.080]   But I'm like, yeah, I don't want a fist bump.
[01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:40.080]   You just drive me somewhere.
[01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:41.080]   I don't want to fist bump you.
[01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:43.080]   And I kind of don't want to sit up front with you because that's-
[01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:44.080]   No.
[01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:45.080]   You're my driver.
[01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:46.080]   You sit in the front.
[01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:47.080]   Well, that's sort of the thing.
[01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:52.000]   I'm like, I'm actually paying you more than a taxi to take me to where I want to go.
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:53.320]   And I'm happy to do that.
[01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:56.080]   But part of that agreement is that we're not friends.
[01:20:56.080 --> 01:20:57.080]   Right.
[01:20:57.080 --> 01:21:01.080]   I'm probably happy to have a conversation with you, but don't make me sit in the front.
[01:21:01.080 --> 01:21:02.080]   Like-
[01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:03.080]   Yeah, that's weird.
[01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:04.080]   That's just-
[01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:06.080]   My first lift I sat in the back seat.
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:07.080]   Yeah.
[01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:09.800]   I sat in the back seat with my first lift and the guy's like, oh, you can come up front.
[01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:10.800]   And I'm like, no, that's good.
[01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:11.800]   I'm good.
[01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:12.800]   No.
[01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:13.800]   It's awkward.
[01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:16.320]   But now you feel like a jerk?
[01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:20.320]   I keep wanting to say the other word, the D word, but now you feel like a jerk because
[01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:24.120]   you're now like this elitist scum that's not even going to sit with your driver.
[01:21:24.120 --> 01:21:25.120]   But-
[01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:26.920]   It's wrong with you.
[01:21:26.920 --> 01:21:29.800]   You're hiring them to drive you.
[01:21:29.800 --> 01:21:30.800]   Like, yeah.
[01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:33.480]   See, it's different if a woman doesn't.
[01:21:33.480 --> 01:21:35.440]   It's different if a woman doesn't.
[01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:39.280]   In some ways it's worse because now you're implying that he's going to like put his hand
[01:21:39.280 --> 01:21:40.280]   on your thigh.
[01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:43.280]   And stop it.
[01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:44.280]   Hi.
[01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:45.280]   I have the pink mustache.
[01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:50.760]   No, I mean, I honestly don't even think it's a gender differentiator.
[01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:53.240]   It's just you're hiring somebody for a service.
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:57.360]   And while, you know, I have lots of mixed feelings about the service economy, it's still, you
[01:21:57.360 --> 01:22:02.160]   know, if I'm hiring somebody who is putting themselves out there for a service and the
[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:06.400]   service that I am hiring them for is a service that I would normally get from a taxi, I
[01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:09.280]   am going to treat like a taxi service.
[01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:10.280]   Exactly.
[01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:13.440]   I'm not going to be like, oh, just because it's $3 cheaper, I'm going to sit up front and
[01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:15.200]   we're going to gossip about our days.
[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:18.280]   Like, unless it's somebody I know who's also a Lyft driver.
[01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:20.440]   But I'm like, yeah, I'm going to give you some business.
[01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:21.440]   But-
[01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:22.440]   I'm having a chance to listen to them.
[01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:23.440]   If that's what they want to do.
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:24.440]   But yeah, you're right.
[01:22:24.440 --> 01:22:25.440]   I don't want to sit up front.
[01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:28.880]   I mean, now if there are like four of us traveling in the car and somebody's got to
[01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:31.160]   like sit up front, like that's totally cool.
[01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:33.680]   But like, otherwise it is a driving the Stacey situation.
[01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:36.720]   But that is part of the, that is part of the agreement you make when you hire someone
[01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:37.720]   to drive a car.
[01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:38.720]   Okay.
[01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:39.720]   So, maybe this is going too far.
[01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:43.280]   I bring a little hat formed to where?
[01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:44.280]   Is that too much?
[01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:45.280]   Yeah.
[01:22:45.280 --> 01:22:46.280]   Look, a little-
[01:22:46.280 --> 01:22:47.280]   That's too much.
[01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:50.600]   No one, no one ever wants to be the person who sits in the front seat of the cab.
[01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:51.600]   If you have four people-
[01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:52.600]   Oh, it's the worst job.
[01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:57.600]   No one ever wants to be the person who sits in the front seat of the cab.
[01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:58.600]   If you have four people-
[01:22:58.600 --> 01:22:59.600]   Oh, it's the worst job.
[01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:02.600]   No one ever wants to be the person who sits in the front seat of the cab.
[01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:04.600]   No one ever wants to be the person who sits in the front seat of the cab.
[01:23:04.600 --> 01:23:05.600]   If you have four people who are going-
[01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:06.600]   Oh, it's the worst job.
[01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:08.600]   No one ever wants to be the person who sits in the front seat of the cab.
[01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:11.080]   If you have four people who sits in the front seat, go through their glove compartment.
[01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:12.080]   Change the radio.
[01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:14.080]   That's what I would do.
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:15.080]   You want to change the radio station.
[01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:16.080]   You don't switch over to the car.
[01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:17.080]   That's true.
[01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:18.440]   You know what I like?
[01:23:18.440 --> 01:23:19.440]   I like this.
[01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:21.200]   Hold on, I got a tape.
[01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:22.280]   Give me a second.
[01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:23.280]   He's totally-
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:27.360]   I brought my own mixed tape, you mind?
[01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:28.360]   This is the-
[01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:30.840]   My group we're learning to have enthroned singing.
[01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:31.840]   Oh boy.
[01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:34.280]   You don't mind if I play this.
[01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:36.240]   So this is my cousin, Ethan.
[01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:38.320]   Ethan Eiler does for Lyft.
[01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:40.360]   He's like their prank guy.
[01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:45.320]   So did you know that in April Fools' day in LA, New York and San Francisco, you could
[01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:51.640]   arrange a prank and there'd be weird practical jokes.
[01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:53.880]   There's prank mode.
[01:23:53.880 --> 01:23:56.520]   Like for instance, let me see here.
[01:23:56.520 --> 01:24:00.280]   This is the article about my cousin, the guy who came up.
[01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:07.560]   So an actor in burned clothing covered in sooten ashes and chicken feathers gets in the car
[01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:13.160]   carrying a live chicken in a cage, ranting about explosions at chickens.
[01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:14.160]   And then-
[01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:20.560]   So you're in this car with this person and then of course your friend gets to say how
[01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:23.240]   you should have seen your face when the-
[01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:27.920]   And apparently this happened to Andrea Guadola who's this Golden State warrior-
[01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:33.560]   Oh no, Festa Zellie, his Lyft driver turned on the radio and a fake talk show began reporting
[01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:36.360]   the news that he'd been cut from the team.
[01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:38.120]   Oh my God.
[01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:44.040]   Meanwhile his teammates were in on the gag began texting him their condolences, but then
[01:24:44.040 --> 01:24:46.760]   there was cake and balloons so everybody was okay.
[01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:47.760]   I guess-
[01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:48.760]   Oh boy.
[01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:50.960]   Literally this was punked on wheels.
[01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:51.960]   Yeah.
[01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:52.960]   Yeah.
[01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:53.960]   That's dangerous.
[01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:54.960]   Yeah.
[01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:57.760]   Because he'd be like, oh you know what, the coach, I've got some things to tell him.
[01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:58.760]   You know.
[01:24:58.760 --> 01:24:59.760]   The thing about-
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:02.760]   Yeah, the thing is Ethan-
[01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:12.080]   Ethan actually had a company called CarStash that made mustaches for cars and then got
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:16.360]   hired by Lyft and brought the mustache along with him.
[01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:17.360]   It was an-
[01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:18.360]   It was an actual hire?
[01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:19.360]   It was an acquire.
[01:25:19.360 --> 01:25:20.360]   They said, you're good.
[01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:21.360]   You're good.
[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:22.360]   Would you please put my-
[01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:27.200]   Have you seen the cars I just saw one today with the fake eyelashes on the headlights?
[01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:28.200]   You've seen those-
[01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:29.200]   Oh yeah.
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:30.200]   Yeah.
[01:25:30.200 --> 01:25:31.200]   That's kind of weird.
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:32.200]   Those are painful.
[01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:37.760]   Maybe he can design something that makes the Tesla Model 3's front end look a little bit
[01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:38.760]   fancy.
[01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:39.760]   You don't like it?
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:41.280]   I like- I love the Model 3.
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:42.280]   I really-
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:43.280]   There is a lot of-
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:44.280]   I found a deposit for a Model 3 but-
[01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:45.280]   Did you?
[01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:46.280]   Yeah.
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:47.280]   Yeah, I did.
[01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:48.280]   I did.
[01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:49.280]   Welcome.
[01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:50.280]   Wow.
[01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:51.280]   That's a cute bug.
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:52.280]   Maybe not that much.
[01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:53.280]   That's a horrible-
[01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:54.280]   That's a horrible bug.
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:58.560]   So the Model 3 doesn't have a radiator because it's an electric car, right?
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:25:59.560]   So there's-
[01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:01.280]   You've got this interesting front end.
[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:02.280]   I think it's-
[01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:03.280]   It looks like a shark.
[01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:04.280]   Yeah.
[01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:07.120]   It does look like it's coming for you.
[01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:09.400]   What number is your reservation, do you know?
[01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:10.400]   I don't know.
[01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:12.160]   No, I don't know if that's not mine.
[01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:15.400]   All I know is that I'm on the East Coast so I'm essentially screwed or-
[01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:16.400]   You're not going to get it.
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:17.400]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:18.400]   It's going to be a while.
[01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:19.400]   Oh.
[01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:25.160]   Which is why I ended up leasing another Prius because I'm like, I leased a Prius back in
[01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:29.960]   2014 when I thought, oh, I just have to get through two years and then the Tesla Model
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:30.960]   3 will be here.
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:35.520]   And then it's two years from now and now there's no Tesla for at least two more years.
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:38.120]   So I'm like, okay, I guess I'm getting back into a Prius.
[01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:39.920]   Tesla, you're not buying a car.
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:42.360]   You're buying an experience.
[01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:44.360]   And this is part of the experience.
[01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:47.360]   The way the experience is right wherever-
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:49.160]   I've had a Model X on order for some time.
[01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:52.480]   I finally wrote an email to Tesla and I said, where's my car?
[01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:54.560]   Because I should be done by now.
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:55.560]   And they said-
[01:26:55.560 --> 01:26:56.920]   Yeah, but you want a car that works.
[01:26:56.920 --> 01:26:57.920]   That's what I said.
[01:26:57.920 --> 01:27:00.800]   I said, they said, well, you know, you mentioned that you're-
[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:03.200]   Lease wasn't expiring until September.
[01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:04.280]   So we're going to have it for you in September.
[01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:05.280]   I said, that's good.
[01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:06.280]   Thank you.
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:07.280]   I'll see you in September.
[01:27:07.280 --> 01:27:08.280]   Yeah.
[01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:09.280]   And hopefully-
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:10.280]   All the bugs will be worked.
[01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:11.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:27:11.280 --> 01:27:12.280]   You don't want-
[01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:13.280]   The doors will close.
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:14.440]   Nothing off the line.
[01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:15.440]   Or doors will open.
[01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:19.200]   Because that's the part of the problem is sometimes they open, sometimes they don't.
[01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:21.120]   Sometimes they open while you're driving.
[01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:22.800]   Sometimes you can't get out.
[01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:23.800]   It's feature.
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:24.800]   It's a feature.
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:25.800]   The mug.
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:26.800]   It's software.
[01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:27.800]   Hubris.
[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:28.800]   That's all.
[01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:29.800]   That's what they call it hubris.
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:33.680]   People access Facebook from Tor every month now.
[01:27:33.680 --> 01:27:34.680]   Fascinating.
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:35.680]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:41.120]   It's so interesting because it's like- I wonder where those people are coming from.
[01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:43.520]   Like that would be the interesting thing to see would be the geographic breakdown.
[01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:47.720]   If it's people who are in countries where they're afraid that their network traffic
[01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:49.560]   is being monitored, so that's why they do it.
[01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:53.320]   Or if it's paranoid people in the United States or what, but that's really interesting.
[01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:55.320]   Or you just do it because you can.
[01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:56.320]   Yeah.
[01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:58.680]   But a million is more than that.
[01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:00.440]   So it's Facebook.onion, right?
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:02.560]   You have to be running a Tor browser.
[01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:06.840]   Facebook's been doing this for some time about a year and a half.
[01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:13.840]   And the idea is that with Tor, as I think you all know, your identity is not completely
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:18.360]   invisible, but it's making some effort to keep yourself anonymous.
[01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:21.160]   Although an anonymous on Facebook, Facebook knows who you are.
[01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:22.160]   They know everything.
[01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:24.680]   They know what kind of underwear you're wearing.
[01:28:24.680 --> 01:28:25.680]   Or if you aren't wearing-
[01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:26.680]   It's a country-specific thing.
[01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:27.680]   Right.
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:31.000]   But apparently what you want to be anonymous is that you don't want your country snooping
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:32.640]   on your Facebook traffic.
[01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:33.640]   Right.
[01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:35.440]   Right, right, right.
[01:28:35.440 --> 01:28:36.440]   Word.
[01:28:36.440 --> 01:28:37.440]   Yeah.
[01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:39.840]   That's my agreement.
[01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:40.840]   Word.
[01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:46.680]   No, if you're in a country with oppressive internet or you still want to be able to tell
[01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:51.480]   talk to family who have gotten out of that country, Facebook's a great way to tell them
[01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:53.640]   what's going on.
[01:28:53.640 --> 01:28:57.400]   I'm still concerned about Facebook's requirement.
[01:28:57.400 --> 01:29:01.400]   You have a real name, especially for people who are in these countries who are using Tor.
[01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:03.640]   It's sort of a weird thing.
[01:29:03.640 --> 01:29:07.920]   But the fact that it's there is nice.
[01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:11.840]   And sometimes I get extra paranoid about stuff and I'll use Tor.
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:14.000]   Have any of you turned on Facebook?
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:15.320]   Actually, what will hold that thought?
[01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:18.600]   I was going to ask you, if any of you have turned on any of the Facebook bots?
[01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:19.600]   Because I have.
[01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:22.480]   And I feel like I'm just going to kill them.
[01:29:22.480 --> 01:29:23.480]   I'm going to kill them.
[01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:24.480]   Seriously.
[01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:25.480]   I'm going to kill that bot.
[01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:26.480]   They're not good.
[01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:27.480]   They're not good.
[01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:31.640]   They're like, oh, I could talk to this bot for five minutes or I could just open the app
[01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:33.400]   and get this taken care of in 20 seconds.
[01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:35.040]   Whatever you do, don't turn on Pancho.
[01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:36.040]   Pancho.
[01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:39.480]   I was going to say, I love it, but yet it is.
[01:29:39.480 --> 01:29:40.480]   Yeah.
[01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:41.880]   Oh, so annoying.
[01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:43.880]   So Pancho's going to go ahead.
[01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:47.320]   No, I was saying you remember the early AIM bots.
[01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:48.720]   Like, yeah, of course.
[01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:50.280]   We've come a bit of a way.
[01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:51.280]   What were the aim bots?
[01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:52.280]   What were they for?
[01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:54.280]   Were they like psychiatrists?
[01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:56.520]   We can't really find you.
[01:29:56.520 --> 01:29:57.520]   Some of them were fun.
[01:29:57.520 --> 01:29:58.520]   Some of them were silly.
[01:29:58.520 --> 01:30:01.320]   Some of them were old Alice thing.
[01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:02.320]   Some of them were creepy.
[01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:03.320]   Yeah.
[01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:05.440]   But no, but Pancho is the what they're bought.
[01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:10.200]   And I really like it except it comes sometimes in opportune times.
[01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:13.680]   You can tell their servers or sometimes hit with things because I'll get a million Panch
[01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:15.400]   notifications at once.
[01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:20.320]   And the one annoying thing I do have to say is that you'll get your Facebook bot notification
[01:30:20.320 --> 01:30:21.640]   on all of your devices.
[01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:26.720]   So if I'm at home, it'll hit my iPhone, my iPad, my computer, like my other iPhone.
[01:30:26.720 --> 01:30:28.240]   And I'm like, really?
[01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:29.240]   Really?
[01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:30.480]   I don't need it on all these things.
[01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:31.480]   Like, right this second.
[01:30:31.480 --> 01:30:32.480]   Oh crap, I clicked on it.
[01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:33.880]   Now he's back.
[01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:38.440]   So the thing about Pancho that's really annoying is you can't cancel it.
[01:30:38.440 --> 01:30:39.800]   I type stop.
[01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:40.800]   I type cancel.
[01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:42.560]   I type go away.
[01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:44.040]   Stop bothering me.
[01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:48.080]   And Ollie comes back with his nonsensical stuff.
[01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:50.680]   And the weather forecaster even kind of nonsensical.
[01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:53.520]   Like weird weather forecasts and stuff.
[01:30:53.520 --> 01:30:57.280]   So finally, I figured out that you can actually block him like a stalker.
[01:30:57.280 --> 01:30:58.280]   You have to block him.
[01:30:58.280 --> 01:30:59.280]   You have to block him.
[01:30:59.280 --> 01:31:00.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:31:00.280 --> 01:31:01.280]   You should have an off command.
[01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:03.080]   You shouldn't have to block him.
[01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:04.080]   No, you shouldn't.
[01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:07.680]   Because the one thing I did like about it is that there were like pollen notifications
[01:31:07.680 --> 01:31:11.720]   built into it, which actually for this time of year in New York is actually helpful.
[01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:12.720]   Yeah.
[01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:15.360]   And that's actually more helpful than what you would get from some of the just typical weather
[01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:18.560]   things where I can be like, your pollen situation today is pretty terrible.
[01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:20.720]   I was like, okay, well, good to know.
[01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:22.080]   I can't really do anything about it.
[01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:24.360]   But now I can like maybe plan my walk.
[01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:25.360]   I'm sneezing.
[01:31:25.360 --> 01:31:26.360]   Yeah.
[01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:27.360]   Precisely.
[01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:30.600]   But yeah, it is the lack of a stop command.
[01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:31.960]   And then, but then I don't know about you.
[01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:35.520]   Like you feel weird blocking them because you're like, well, I might want to use this
[01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:36.520]   again.
[01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:37.520]   Yeah.
[01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:38.520]   Yeah.
[01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:41.680]   I blocked it because I couldn't cancel it.
[01:31:41.680 --> 01:31:44.000]   It's a bit like right now they're at the right.
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:47.840]   They're not as fun, but they're a bit like the cat facts.
[01:31:47.840 --> 01:31:50.720]   I think from a few years ago, this guy started, you know, he got a new phone number.
[01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:53.280]   He started texting his friend cat facts.
[01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:56.760]   And he's like, oh, if you don't want to in cat facts, you know, you know, reply was
[01:31:56.760 --> 01:31:58.360]   stopped when guy reply was stopped.
[01:31:58.360 --> 01:32:01.120]   And he would just reply with more and more cat facts.
[01:32:01.120 --> 01:32:02.120]   Facts.
[01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:04.600]   Facts like what a fact about cats.
[01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:05.600]   Yeah.
[01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:07.160]   Facts about cats.
[01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:08.160]   And it was a great pain.
[01:32:08.160 --> 01:32:09.160]   It was hilarious.
[01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:10.160]   And I laughed.
[01:32:10.160 --> 01:32:12.680]   And it's pretty much where Pancho is right now, but not funny.
[01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:13.680]   Right.
[01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:15.080]   It's like the worst cat facts prank.
[01:32:15.080 --> 01:32:16.080]   Yeah.
[01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:18.280]   Because Pancho tries to be funny.
[01:32:18.280 --> 01:32:21.360]   There's only worse than trying to be funny.
[01:32:21.360 --> 01:32:28.320]   No one wants a funny robot.
[01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:29.320]   No.
[01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:31.320]   Series trying.
[01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:32.560]   They're all trying.
[01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:34.640]   Just yeah, I think bots.
[01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:38.880]   Well, yeah, be funny if you can't answer something.
[01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:41.920]   If it's something, it's a command that you don't know how to parse.
[01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:44.400]   No, but I'm not asking Pancho anything.
[01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:45.400]   It just sends me.
[01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:54.600]   You know, weird, weird, like just like a nonsensical like 55% of Netflix users hate 60 degree weather.
[01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:55.760]   And that's what you're going to get.
[01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:57.480]   I mean, it's literally like that.
[01:32:57.480 --> 01:32:59.640]   I can't, I don't have any because I blocked it.
[01:32:59.640 --> 01:33:01.080]   Now it's deleted forever.
[01:33:01.080 --> 01:33:03.000]   But it was that stupid.
[01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.760]   It's like, why are you telling me this?
[01:33:04.760 --> 01:33:06.000]   I don't go away, weather.
[01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.000]   Go away.
[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.600]   Look how menacing he looks.
[01:33:08.600 --> 01:33:09.600]   It's actually creepy.
[01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:11.600]   With his little, he's got a little thing on.
[01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:13.640]   He's just like, oh, he's a Pancho cat.
[01:33:13.640 --> 01:33:14.640]   He's cute.
[01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:16.640]   He's cute until you say stop.
[01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:17.640]   And he goes, I don't know.
[01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:18.640]   What do you mean?
[01:33:18.640 --> 01:33:19.640]   What do you mean?
[01:33:19.640 --> 01:33:20.640]   Look, see, he's watching me.
[01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:21.760]   He's a cancel.
[01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:25.760]   And he goes, I can't do that.
[01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:27.480]   Then he stops being so cute.
[01:33:27.480 --> 01:33:28.480]   I can't quit you.
[01:33:28.480 --> 01:33:29.480]   I can't quit you.
[01:33:29.480 --> 01:33:33.000]   I have to tell you about the 6% of Netflix users hate the weather.
[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.320]   Yeah, it's like my creepy boyfriend or something.
[01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:36.800]   He doesn't want to ever go away.
[01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:38.960]   He's like, his eyes just look like they're staring at me.
[01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:39.960]   He's like, come to me.
[01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:40.960]   Give me a take.
[01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:42.440]   Go out of the weather.
[01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:44.440]   I am watching you.
[01:33:44.440 --> 01:33:46.440]   I am watching you.
[01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:49.040]   No matter where you move, he's watching you.
[01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:50.040]   Like his eyes follow you.
[01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:51.040]   Oh, they are.
[01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:55.120]   Oh, my God.
[01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:58.120]   Our show today brought you by something that will relax you.
[01:33:58.120 --> 01:33:59.120]   Headspace.
[01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:01.960]   Have you ever meditated?
[01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:03.880]   Meditating is so cool.
[01:34:03.880 --> 01:34:06.960]   I think sometimes people go, I don't want to do that thing where you go, you know, they
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:08.840]   get the bell and you.
[01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:16.200]   And while meditation, of course, has thousands of years of tradition, headspace is very modern,
[01:34:16.200 --> 01:34:17.200]   not airy-fairy at all.
[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:18.760]   In fact, you're going to love it.
[01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:20.360]   Andy Puttycomb is the guy who created it.
[01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:24.920]   He was a monk for many years, but he's very straightforward.
[01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:25.920]   And this is so great.
[01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:26.920]   You can, it's a free app.
[01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:31.600]   You put on your iPhone or your Android phone and you get 10 free meditation sessions.
[01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:34.440]   And that's really all you need to know what this can do for you.
[01:34:34.440 --> 01:34:36.200]   Meditation focuses you.
[01:34:36.200 --> 01:34:39.440]   It reduces fear and anger and stress and anxiety.
[01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:41.920]   You'll fear your relationships get better.
[01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:46.240]   Your life will get better just from 10 minutes of Andy's voice.
[01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:52.280]   We should play some of Andy's voice on this because he's so, he's so, you can actually
[01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:56.200]   listen to his TED talk if you want to do that before you join Headspace.
[01:34:56.200 --> 01:34:57.200]   It's free right now though.
[01:34:57.200 --> 01:34:58.200]   Why not?
[01:34:58.200 --> 01:34:59.680]   You go on the web.
[01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:02.240]   You can do it on your phone.
[01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:03.240]   You can.
[01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:04.480]   And it's nice on your phone.
[01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:09.480]   You know, I will either listen on headphones so it's kind of more private or you can also
[01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:10.880]   put it on speakers.
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:16.560]   It's very relaxing and you feel very good afterwards.
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:20.760]   But don't do it while you're driving a car.
[01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:25.480]   Headspace.com/twit.
[01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:30.480]   Andy Puttycomb, if you search for his TED talk, it's all about meditation and stuff here.
[01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:34.120]   Let me play a little session.
[01:35:34.120 --> 01:35:37.440]   Winning the mind is often quite different to how people imagine it to be.
[01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:38.440]   I love his voice.
[01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:43.800]   Maybe they have an idea it's about stopping thoughts or eliminating feelings.
[01:35:43.800 --> 01:35:47.240]   But the reality is a bit different.
[01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:52.280]   An easy way to think of it is to imagine yourself sitting by the side of a busy road.
[01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:55.320]   The passing cars representing the thoughts and the feelings.
[01:35:55.320 --> 01:35:56.320]   Let's just love it.
[01:35:56.320 --> 01:35:57.320]   Headspace.
[01:35:57.320 --> 01:35:58.840]   All you have to do is to sit there and watch the cars.
[01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:02.160]   It's your gym membership for the mind.
[01:36:02.160 --> 01:36:04.440]   He's Andy Puttycomb and he's in your head.
[01:36:04.440 --> 01:36:05.600]   He's in my head now.
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:08.760]   And you know when I get stressed out I hear Andy's voice and I get better.
[01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:10.400]   Five million users now.
[01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:12.760]   Headspace.com/twit would be one of them.
[01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:13.960]   Emma Watson uses it.
[01:36:13.960 --> 01:36:14.960]   Jared Leto.
[01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:17.560]   Gwyneth Paltrow.
[01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:18.560]   Headspace.
[01:36:18.560 --> 01:36:21.040]   Have you noticed I'm calmer now than I used to be?
[01:36:21.040 --> 01:36:22.680]   I'm more relaxed.
[01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:26.320]   I feel better.
[01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:28.560]   The internet is broken.
[01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:32.720]   There's Edward Snowden.
[01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:36.480]   He says why this is a long, actually really a long piece.
[01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:38.400]   I'm not even going to try to recreate it.
[01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:40.880]   It's in popular science.
[01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:41.880]   It's worth reading.
[01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:48.280]   Put this in your pocket or your instant paper or your readability and spend some time with
[01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:51.520]   it.
[01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:56.880]   It's more of an article by Edward than a conversation.
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:37:02.840]   He says really the way we're doing this is instead of going after individual criminals
[01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:07.400]   and terrorists we're going after everybody.
[01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:11.200]   And we can't get our privacy.
[01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:16.240]   Did you, and Gadget wrote about, I thought a very good article about this 60 minutes
[01:37:16.240 --> 01:37:17.240]   piece last week.
[01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:19.840]   Oh yeah, Violet Blue wrote about that.
[01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:21.440]   That's right Violet wrote that.
[01:37:21.440 --> 01:37:22.440]   Yeah.
[01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:25.400]   She's my security reporter hero.
[01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:26.400]   She's great.
[01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:30.960]   Every time there's a anytime I can hang out with Violet I'm really happy because she fills
[01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:32.440]   my brain with knowledge.
[01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:33.440]   Yeah.
[01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:35.560]   So 60 minutes, I didn't know this.
[01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:39.720]   I learned it from the Violet article.
[01:37:39.720 --> 01:37:47.680]   60 minutes took a piece that they had done in Australia a year ago about the SS7 hack,
[01:37:47.680 --> 01:37:50.000]   which we've known about since 2007 by the way.
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:51.320]   And that is a genuine hack.
[01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:56.280]   That is a flaw in the baseband radio and every single phone.
[01:37:56.280 --> 01:38:02.120]   And it's been known since for nine years and nobody's paying any attention to it.
[01:38:02.120 --> 01:38:03.120]   So that was legitimate.
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:08.880]   But then they took that and they mushed in some stuff from Defcon.
[01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:10.440]   And they've Defcon last year.
[01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:11.440]   Last year.
[01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:12.440]   A year old Defcon.
[01:38:12.440 --> 01:38:13.440]   Yep.
[01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:16.400]   And watching I'm like, wait, I went to this Defcon.
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:17.400]   What's going on?
[01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:18.760]   I was looking for a video of me.
[01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:19.760]   That's what I'm.
[01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:20.760]   Yeah.
[01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:21.760]   And it scared people reasonably.
[01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:24.680]   In fact, now there's going to be a congressional inquiry.
[01:38:24.680 --> 01:38:25.680]   Like.
[01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:26.680]   God.
[01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:33.520]   And of course they use somebody from a lockout or look out, I'm sorry.
[01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:38.200]   Somebody selling security software as an expert saying, you know, you need some security
[01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:39.200]   software.
[01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:41.200]   Well, yeah.
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:47.520]   Anyway, Violet does a good take down on it.
[01:38:47.520 --> 01:38:53.480]   What she points out is while the SS7 hack is real, it is a difficult thing to do and
[01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:56.800]   probably would have to be a nation state or, you know, a big actor.
[01:38:56.800 --> 01:39:02.240]   It wouldn't just be some guy going after you in a coffee shop.
[01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:06.040]   Also we should point out that you don't have to really run out and buy a look at security
[01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:10.040]   for your Android or iPhone.
[01:39:10.040 --> 01:39:11.040]   But a good piece.
[01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:12.040]   Yeah.
[01:39:12.040 --> 01:39:16.120]   Especially, you know, they make it sound like everybody's going to be hacked like this.
[01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:17.120]   And it's not.
[01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:22.120]   It's going, you know, if you're a president of a large company or the CEO or, you know,
[01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:25.200]   if you're dealing, you know, if you're, if you're a huge target, then maybe you should
[01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:29.480]   be concerned about this, but 99.9% of us are just like.
[01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:30.480]   Yeah.
[01:39:30.480 --> 01:39:31.480]   Does it?
[01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:32.480]   Yeah.
[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:37.840]   No one's going to, you know, no one's going to hack the network, the, the telephone network
[01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:38.840]   so they can listen to you.
[01:39:38.840 --> 01:39:39.840]   To you.
[01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:40.840]   Right.
[01:39:40.840 --> 01:39:42.520]   And the only time I use my phone is to actually order food.
[01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:46.320]   So no one's going to, you know, it was typical TV.
[01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:48.760]   They, you know, they really dramatize it.
[01:39:48.760 --> 01:39:49.760]   You know, they had everything.
[01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:54.400]   You know, they had the hackers sitting around in a dark room and they gave a, you know,
[01:39:54.400 --> 01:39:56.280]   this talk about history, onics.
[01:39:56.280 --> 01:40:01.480]   They had an iPhone and they gave it to a congressman and then, and then they gave the
[01:40:01.480 --> 01:40:06.000]   phone number to the bad guys used to use SS seven and the bad guys start playing the
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.280]   congressman's phone calls and text messages.
[01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:10.320]   It's like, oh, that's dramatic.
[01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:12.440]   But so this is how Violet wraps it up.
[01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:13.600]   Don't get me wrong.
[01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:18.840]   SS seven surveillance network spoofing, fishing and spurious product placement are all very
[01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:21.800]   real issues that consumers need to be on top of.
[01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:26.000]   But 60 minutes got it all backward in the name of drama.
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:30.040]   The show may as well have told people to soak their phones in bleach before burning
[01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:37.600]   them after their next sex for all the uselessness and flat out fakity fake hysteria and hacking
[01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:38.600]   your phone.
[01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:42.240]   They're a million great, truly chilling and unbelievably urgent hacking stories to be
[01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:43.520]   told.
[01:40:43.520 --> 01:40:47.560]   Ones that desperately need to be addressed by the FCC and congressional investigations,
[01:40:47.560 --> 01:40:53.240]   that can be all those things only, but when they're told accurately after this, I don't
[01:40:53.240 --> 01:40:55.080]   believe we'll see any of them on 60 minutes.
[01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:57.480]   So just a little takeaway.
[01:40:57.480 --> 01:40:59.120]   We talked about it on security now a little bit.
[01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:05.640]   We had covered the chaos computing clubs revelations about SS seven two or three years
[01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:07.160]   ago.
[01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:11.600]   But as I didn't know this, but Violet points out that we've known about this since 2007.
[01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:12.800]   This is not new.
[01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:13.800]   Wow.
[01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:14.800]   Yeah.
[01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:15.800]   It is an issue.
[01:41:15.800 --> 01:41:16.800]   Yeah.
[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:19.840]   The only place I'm worried about someone spoofing a cell tower is a DEF CON.
[01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:23.000]   That's the only place where I actually that's the most dangerous place yet.
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:24.000]   Yeah, that's yeah.
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:25.680]   I have I have a burner phone with burner accounts.
[01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:29.000]   I have a burner computer with burner accounts like when I'm at DEF CON like nothing.
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:30.000]   Totally.
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:31.000]   Yeah, it's awesome.
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:32.000]   I love DEF CON.
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:33.000]   It's fun.
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.000]   Yeah.
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.000]   Same time.
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:36.000]   Yeah, don't bring your computer.
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:37.000]   You don't want to be on the wall of sheep.
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:38.000]   Yeah.
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:39.640]   Oh, good old wall of sheep.
[01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:40.640]   Embarrassing.
[01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:44.600]   That's people there every year.
[01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:50.080]   Viber now joins WhatsApp with end to end encryption and hidden chats.
[01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:57.480]   Viber is another widely used kind of Skype kind of messaging app around the world.
[01:41:57.480 --> 01:42:00.520]   A lot of people use Viber.
[01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:03.960]   So this is we're heading to go ahead.
[01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:07.080]   And what's interesting I was going to say about Viber is because there's a Japanese
[01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:13.240]   company, any of the, you know, financing for encryption stuff that they're that won't
[01:42:13.240 --> 01:42:17.520]   get passed anyway, but let's just pretend that it did would be irrelevant in this case
[01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:20.280]   because it's a Japanese company.
[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:21.720]   Right.
[01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:24.240]   So exactly.
[01:42:24.240 --> 01:42:27.000]   It doesn't look like Feinstein burr will going to is going to go anywhere.
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:28.000]   It doesn't.
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:31.800]   No, no, no, I don't think it will, but but but but this is just I think shows how silly
[01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:37.600]   and shortsighted and frankly dangerous those bills are because they're saying is they're
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:42.480]   basically penalizing American companies for trying to make products cure when what will
[01:42:42.480 --> 01:42:47.600]   happen is that companies that have operate in other places and Viber was formed by a place
[01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:51.600]   in Israel and then was by bought was bought by the what is it?
[01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:54.640]   Rakuten Rakuten, the Japanese e-commerce.
[01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:59.360]   Rakuten, the Japanese e-commerce giant bought them, you know, it'll just be it all that
[01:42:59.360 --> 01:43:03.640]   stuff will just move to foreign companies and and those companies will continue to sell
[01:43:03.640 --> 01:43:07.560]   apps or offer apps that people can download and and use.
[01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:12.280]   So all you're really doing is just moving that the way you communicate to other services
[01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:19.440]   and and and hurting American companies from even offering a secure solution.
[01:43:19.440 --> 01:43:22.400]   There may be a reason why Congress is so clueless.
[01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:30.840]   Good article in Wired, Kim Zetter writing that they fired the Office of Technology Assessment
[01:43:30.840 --> 01:43:33.040]   more than 10 years ago.
[01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:36.520]   Actually almost two decades ago in a round of budget cuts.
[01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:41.560]   This was a a body of independent technical and scientific experts were there to advise
[01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:43.480]   Congress on technology.
[01:43:43.480 --> 01:43:44.680]   It was so good.
[01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:50.200]   It was became the model for other countries to create their own offices of technology
[01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:51.720]   assessment.
[01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:55.920]   But part of the contract of of America with America that Newt Gingrich put forth in the
[01:43:55.920 --> 01:44:00.120]   90s defunded it.
[01:44:00.120 --> 01:44:01.720]   And that was that.
[01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:06.440]   And now only about four members of Congress have any technical expertise any technical
[01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:07.440]   expertise.
[01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:11.440]   And so many people who are not in the state of America have a technical expertise.
[01:44:11.440 --> 01:44:16.440]   And so many people who are not in the state of America have a technical expertise.
[01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:21.440]   And so many people who are not in the state of America have a technical expertise.
[01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:26.440]   And so many people who are not in the state of America have a technical expertise.
[01:44:26.440 --> 01:44:31.440]   And so many people who are not in the state of America have a technical expertise.
[01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:35.440]   And so many people who are not in the state of America have a technical expertise.
[01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:38.040]   They were known for their rigor, their quality.
[01:44:38.040 --> 01:44:43.080]   And they were the according to the Washington Times, the voice of authority in a city inundated
[01:44:43.080 --> 01:44:46.160]   with statistics and technical gobbledygook.
[01:44:46.160 --> 01:44:48.960]   Well now all we have is the technical gobbledygook.
[01:44:48.960 --> 01:44:52.320]   It was bipartisan.
[01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:53.320]   Crazy.
[01:44:53.320 --> 01:44:55.760]   It explains a lot though.
[01:44:55.760 --> 01:44:56.760]   Yeah.
[01:44:56.760 --> 01:44:58.600]   It comes another giant brain that I.
[01:44:58.600 --> 01:44:59.600]   She's great.
[01:44:59.600 --> 01:45:00.600]   When I talk to her.
[01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:01.600]   Yeah.
[01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:02.600]   She's just fantastic.
[01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:03.600]   I love Kim.
[01:45:03.600 --> 01:45:09.600]   Interesting thing she points out is really members of Congress didn't want some smarty
[01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:15.280]   group of smarty pants telling the world that their stupid Feinstein Burr encryption idea
[01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:19.640]   was a boneheaded idea that just made everybody look bad.
[01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:20.640]   Totally.
[01:45:20.640 --> 01:45:21.640]   Oh no.
[01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:22.640]   So now it's my job.
[01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:25.640]   I don't know if you have to have so close.
[01:45:25.640 --> 01:45:29.600]   You don't want anybody telling anybody the truth, especially in government, right?
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:31.600]   We don't want anybody to actually know what's going on.
[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:34.600]   Eggheads ruining everything.
[01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:35.600]   We're in everything.
[01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:39.800]   Well that's our job now.
[01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:45.520]   Did you read the expose of the well so go so Kevin Kelly who I really like wrote a very
[01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:52.920]   nice piece working on a long time about magic leap kind of promoting this technology without
[01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:55.040]   really revealing in any way how it worked.
[01:45:55.040 --> 01:46:00.160]   Neelipa tell did a great job I thought in the verge saying here's five questions that
[01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:02.240]   remain on the answer.
[01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:05.400]   What the hell is it?
[01:46:05.400 --> 01:46:13.400]   And here's the picture from Wired of a magic leap engineer in a photonics lab doing what
[01:46:13.400 --> 01:46:18.160]   Neelipa calls appears to be cool engineer stuff.
[01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:20.960]   But what is it?
[01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:21.960]   And what's it running on?
[01:46:21.960 --> 01:46:25.120]   He says is there a giant fridge sized supercomputer under the table?
[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:27.960]   Is there a new magic leap operating system?
[01:46:27.960 --> 01:46:30.920]   What is going on here?
[01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:36.520]   And then he said of course there's this video that is billed as as shot through magic leap
[01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:37.520]   technology.
[01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:41.640]   Neelipa writes so you know how does that work?
[01:46:41.640 --> 01:46:42.880]   What did the camera rig look like?
[01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:46.200]   Did they really just mount the glasses on the front of the DSLR?
[01:46:46.200 --> 01:46:49.480]   Why can't you see the frames of the glasses or any pixels at all?
[01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:51.400]   How did the camera know what to focus on?
[01:46:51.400 --> 01:46:53.000]   Is the content we're seeing live?
[01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:54.000]   Is it pre rendered?
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:55.200]   Wait a minute.
[01:46:55.200 --> 01:46:57.040]   Is that the Google Hangouts icon?
[01:46:57.040 --> 01:47:00.960]   Is there a Google Hangouts app or integration?
[01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:05.480]   Does magic leap know how to parse the contents of that message and then pull related data?
[01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:06.560]   Now I love Kevin.
[01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:09.880]   I think Kevin's a great guy and he's a season knowledgeable guy.
[01:47:09.880 --> 01:47:15.720]   But it does feel like he maybe this was not the most thorough investigation of what magic
[01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:16.720]   leap is up to.
[01:47:16.720 --> 01:47:21.040]   Have any of you played with it or seen it or all we've all seen is these demo videos?
[01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:22.040]   I have not.
[01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:23.040]   No.
[01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:26.360]   The video reminds me I remember the Google Glass demo video came out.
[01:47:26.360 --> 01:47:28.200]   Yes, the guy running along.
[01:47:28.200 --> 01:47:29.200]   And I was insane.
[01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:34.120]   And I end up talking to AR experts and they're like, who the hell are they doing this?
[01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:35.720]   I've been doing this for 10 years.
[01:47:35.720 --> 01:47:36.720]   We know.
[01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:38.520]   Unless you're projecting right in your nose.
[01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:41.080]   And then of course Google Glass came out and we're all like this.
[01:47:41.080 --> 01:47:45.200]   It's a simulation in serving suggestion.
[01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:47.160]   It's like Microsoft's HoloLens.
[01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:51.200]   Someday you will.
[01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:53.520]   So anyway.
[01:47:53.520 --> 01:47:59.680]   The reason it's an issue is because as a number of people have pointed out, between Theranos
[01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:08.680]   and other kind of kick starters become the poster child for this kind of suspicious technologies.
[01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:10.440]   It feels like we're falling for a lot of stuff.
[01:48:10.440 --> 01:48:15.080]   And of course there's so much money flying around in Silicon Valley that they're getting
[01:48:15.080 --> 01:48:16.080]   funding.
[01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:21.000]   I mean, magically it's taken so much or is valued at so much and for none of us to know
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:24.760]   what they are, you know, and they are so secretive, which is why the article was interesting
[01:48:24.760 --> 01:48:27.120]   that we at least got some sort of insight into something.
[01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:29.320]   It just has Neelai pointed out.
[01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:31.120]   We still know what the hell this stuff is.
[01:48:31.120 --> 01:48:35.040]   It's really interesting, but we don't know what the hell it is.
[01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:38.200]   Maybe someday.
[01:48:38.200 --> 01:48:39.840]   We will learn.
[01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:40.840]   Fingers crossed.
[01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:42.440]   I mean, I would love it.
[01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:45.320]   I think part of the problem is we look at that and go, that's what I want.
[01:48:45.320 --> 01:48:46.320]   That's what I want.
[01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:47.320]   That's what I want.
[01:48:47.320 --> 01:48:48.320]   That is the future.
[01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:49.680]   That is minority report, right?
[01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:50.680]   Yeah.
[01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:51.680]   It's until it's actually.
[01:48:51.680 --> 01:48:52.680]   It's until it is actually.
[01:48:52.680 --> 01:48:53.680]   Yes.
[01:48:53.680 --> 01:48:54.680]   I honestly don't know.
[01:48:54.680 --> 01:48:57.600]   I don't want stuff on my face all the time.
[01:48:57.600 --> 01:48:58.600]   I don't want to do that.
[01:48:58.600 --> 01:48:59.600]   That's not relaxing.
[01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:00.800]   Like I can relax at home and watch a movie.
[01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:01.800]   I'm like, I can do that on the couch.
[01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:02.800]   I look at my TV.
[01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:05.720]   I don't want to look on the couch and I'm like, oh, and then you take it off.
[01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:08.080]   And now I have zits like all around my face.
[01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:09.080]   Great.
[01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:10.080]   Thanks.
[01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:11.960]   We're all just going to have to get used to raccoon face.
[01:49:11.960 --> 01:49:14.440]   We're just that, you know, we all have to get used to that.
[01:49:14.440 --> 01:49:15.800]   We're all going to have it.
[01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:16.800]   You know what I love?
[01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:21.800]   Actually, you know, the Broadway singers and shows, they have like the little head mics.
[01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:24.760]   I wouldn't mind something like that where it's like it hides right here.
[01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:25.760]   And then it.
[01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:27.400]   Someday you'll have a little thing.
[01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:31.000]   You'll look like one of those angler fish who has a thing that's hanging out there.
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:34.800]   There'll be something beaming into your eyes at all times.
[01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:36.400]   I wouldn't go into my contact loads.
[01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:39.040]   If I could have a built-in my contact loads exactly there.
[01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:40.040]   I think that's it.
[01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:41.040]   That's potential, right?
[01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:42.040]   There's potential.
[01:49:42.040 --> 01:49:43.040]   As long as there's no camera.
[01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:44.040]   Here.
[01:49:44.040 --> 01:49:45.040]   You mean, pointing out?
[01:49:45.040 --> 01:49:47.040]   Read only information.
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:48.040]   Yeah.
[01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:50.320]   I don't want to unless I'm a spy.
[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:53.120]   I don't want to take pictures with my eyes.
[01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:54.120]   You've all seen black mirror.
[01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:55.120]   Oh, but I do.
[01:49:55.120 --> 01:49:56.120]   Yeah.
[01:49:56.120 --> 01:49:57.120]   Yeah.
[01:49:57.120 --> 01:49:59.560]   Do you remember that it was like the second or third episode of Black Mirror where everybody
[01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:03.080]   has a built-in recording of their whole life.
[01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:07.720]   And they spent a lot of time like reviewing like great moments of the past.
[01:50:07.720 --> 01:50:09.080]   They're all looking like that.
[01:50:09.080 --> 01:50:13.040]   Everybody's looking in the half distance with their remote control going like this all
[01:50:13.040 --> 01:50:14.040]   the time.
[01:50:14.040 --> 01:50:15.040]   They're really good.
[01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:17.040]   What a great show that is.
[01:50:17.040 --> 01:50:18.520]   It's a phenomenal show.
[01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:19.520]   Wasn't that good?
[01:50:19.520 --> 01:50:20.520]   Black Mirror.
[01:50:20.520 --> 01:50:21.760]   It's modern day Twilight Zone.
[01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:22.760]   This is exactly what it is.
[01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:23.760]   It's super eerie.
[01:50:23.760 --> 01:50:25.960]   It really is a perfect description.
[01:50:25.960 --> 01:50:26.960]   Yeah.
[01:50:26.960 --> 01:50:27.960]   Yeah.
[01:50:27.960 --> 01:50:28.960]   That one was excellent.
[01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:29.960]   And what is it?
[01:50:29.960 --> 01:50:37.640]   The guy gets mad at his wife because she's reviewing moments of passion with some other
[01:50:37.640 --> 01:50:39.960]   guy that happened in the past.
[01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:40.960]   Right?
[01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:42.360]   And he says, "Well, I want to see that."
[01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:43.360]   She says, "No."
[01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:44.360]   Delete it.
[01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:45.360]   No.
[01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:48.840]   Better we're in Inside Outland where it's only up here.
[01:50:48.840 --> 01:50:49.840]   Yeah.
[01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:50.840]   It's only up here.
[01:50:50.840 --> 01:50:51.840]   Yeah.
[01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:52.840]   You can't see it.
[01:50:52.840 --> 01:50:53.840]   Exactly.
[01:50:53.840 --> 01:50:54.840]   So good.
[01:50:54.840 --> 01:50:55.840]   So good.
[01:50:55.840 --> 01:50:59.840]   Speaking of TV, tonight's the night.
