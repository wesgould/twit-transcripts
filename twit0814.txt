[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120]   It's time for "Twig this Week" in Tech. Great panel for you. Jason Heiner is here from CNET.
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.480]   Larry Maggett from Connect Safely. And from Consumer Reports, I'm really excited.
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.440]   Nicholas De Leon, he's their senior electronics reporter. There's lots to talk about. Who would
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:25.200]   pay 69 million dollars for a J-Pay? Well, apparently someone would. It's the third largest price ever
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.200]   for a living artist, unbelievable. We'll also talk about who we think did it and what the real
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   reason behind it is. Some good news for internet users in rural areas. We'll talk about that and
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.760]   watch out. Time to stop sharing your Netflix password. They're cracking down. It's all coming up next on
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.080]   "Twig."

[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:29.120]   It's time for Twit this Week at Tech to show where we cover the week's tech news with the best
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.880]   people I can find on short notice. No, it's the best people in tech journalism like Jason Heiner,
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:41.440]   editorial director at CNET. Hi Jason. Hey, a pleasure to be here as always. For many years,
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:48.160]   my dear friend at Tech Republic, now you've been moved upstairs. Is that right?
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:03:01.440]   Yes, at CNET now, which is great. It's obviously it's a much bigger brand, right? It's like 10x
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:10.640]   the size of the brand. It was all owned by ZDNet. Actually, it was opposite. CNET bought
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.760]   ZDNet and Tech Republic. Okay, so you were originally ZDNet. You got bought by CNET,
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.400]   which then got bought by the bigger fish, which is Verizon, right?
[00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:29.040]   So first it was CVS and then CVS recently in the...
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.720]   My red ventures. No, I'm concerned. My red ventures.
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.880]   You got it. That's right. So red ventures bought ZDNet, CNET, all the CVS interactive properties.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.640]   That's correct. It's pretty confusing. So sometimes you have people on...
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.280]   Like when Devinder Harderwar from Van Mengej, he asked us to say, "Well, I can't talk about that.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.760]   I work for Verizon." But I don't think we have to worry about a conflict of interest with red
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:01.120]   ventures. I don't think there's anything. No. No. No. No corporate parent that is connected with
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.160]   any tech company. Perfect. So there you go. Love that. Here's another guy that used to work
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.440]   for CVS. Larry Maggot is here. He's now... Are you still at the BBC at the B.B.?
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.040]   Yeah, I do occasional stuff, but the problem was that they wanted exclusivity for global television,
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:23.120]   and I can make more money doing reports for Al Jazeera. So I told them I would... So I go on
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.160]   their air once in a while, but more of like a freelance analyst. I love this. I'm going to start
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.400]   saying Al Jazeera is Larry Maggot. No, no, I don't do that. That'll win you, friends.
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.920]   I'm not ashamed of it. It's a... No, it actually is surprisingly good.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.920]   It's very good. It shouldn't be surprised. My brand is now Connect Safely.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.560]   Connectsafely.org. That's right.
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.560]   Been there for... Did you start it? You were one of the... I go found it in 2005, and it's
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.880]   grown, and actually we had a good 2020, surprisingly, and we're doing fine.
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:05:01.120]   I have been for the last 40 years, I think, a subscriber to Consumer Reports. In fact,
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:06.160]   I have to say Consumer Reports influenced very much how I do my tech coverage. For one thing,
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.680]   they don't take ads, and they buy the products they review. Now I still have to take ads. I tried
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:18.240]   not to, but it didn't work. But I do try to buy the products we review. And I was really thrilled.
[00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:23.760]   The other day I got an email from Nicholas De Leon, who is their senior electronics reporter to talk
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:30.160]   about something we'd had on an earlier show. And I said, "Nicolas, I'm a long time subscriber and
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:36.800]   member. I love Consumer Union, the parent organization. Come on the show." And he and his brick wall
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:41.600]   have agreed. Welcome. Yes. It's great to have you. Hello. Thank you for having me, Leo. It's funny
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:48.320]   you say that CR has kind of inspired you. I am a big fan of yours going back way back. I am not
[00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.840]   exaggerating when I say that Call for Health back in the day was appointment viewing it. Oh my god!
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:06:00.320]   For me. So this is really quite me feeling old. Now I'm feeling old. Call for Health was one of
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:07.840]   two shows I did on Tech TV and it was the one that got saved by the Canada's Tech TV. And I kept
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.240]   doing it up there in Toronto for a while. So it's nice to meet you, Nicholas. Thank you for coming on.
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:19.360]   Pleasure. I got to start with this story because it's just crazy. We've been talking a lot about
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:29.760]   NFTs of late non-fungible tokens which are in some weird way related to crypto currencies
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:35.360]   and in some weird way related to blockchain. In fact, we've had many explainers over the last
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:42.800]   three weeks and I still don't really get it. We in fact had Trey Radcliffe, the very talented
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:48.000]   photographer on Wednesday on this week in Google because he's doing some NFTs of his work.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:55.840]   And I thought, well maybe he can explain it. No one can explain it. And then the other shoe dropped.
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:06.480]   This week at Christie's, which is the big auction site for art, a creator of art named Beeple
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:19.680]   sold one of his jpegs. It's a digital creation for $69 million. Is it dollars or is it crypto?
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:28.000]   Well, it's worth $69 million, whatever it is. It is the third largest price paid for a living artist.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.320]   Beeple is up there now with Jeff Coons and David Hockney.
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:40.240]   To be fair, $9.3 million went to Christie's, which immediately I'm sure turned the Ethereum
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:48.800]   into American Goldheart cash. $60 million of it was bid by an anonymous bidder using a pseudonym,
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.560]   although we think we now know who it is. And I'll explain that in just a second.
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:58.240]   $60 million. What did you get for the $60 million? Did you get something you can hang on your wall? No.
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:06.240]   Did you get? What did you get? You didn't even get the JPEG. I guess you could have the JPEG.
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:10.960]   You got an address which would give you this JPEG, which by the way, consists of 5,000 images
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:18.640]   that Beeple has taken. He does a daily art image over the last, well, since 2007, whatever that is,
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.960]   14 years. So, I mean, it's kind of the collected works of Beeple.
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:30.960]   But you don't even really get anything except a thing that says you own it.
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:36.240]   It could be infinitely reproduced. You can print it. Anybody can print it, but you won't.
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:40.000]   And only you can own it. And that's a that's affirmed on the blockchain.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.880]   $60 million. Now, the guy who bought it uses the name Medi-Kovin.
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:51.440]   But Amy Castor, who I don't know from Adam, but wrote in the blog and convinced me
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:58.720]   that that in fact is a crypto entrepreneur who's been on the scene for about seven years,
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:07.840]   named Vignesh Sundarasan. And furthermore, Amy Castor kind of explained for the first time to me
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:18.880]   what's really going on here. So, it wasn't Medi-Kovin's own Ethereum that he spent. In effect,
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:27.840]   he created a another crypto bundle called B.20.
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:36.400]   Bought the painting with that and is selling shares, bits, fractional portions of the Beeple
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:40.800]   artwork to other people. In other words, step three, profit.
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:52.640]   59, he owns 59% of B.20. Notice who else owns it. Beeple owns a 2% stake. So, in effect,
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:58.960]   Beeple bought his own painting or part of his own painting. I'm not that there's any conflict
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:04.960]   of interest there or is there. But really, I think if there is, if in your mind, there is some
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:09.120]   question, and I'll ask you guys now to comment, but if they're in your mind some question about
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:17.760]   what the hell is, how could a JPEG be worth $69.3 million? And why would somebody in a
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:25.120]   Medi-Kovin spend that kind of money on a JPEG? It now becomes clear he's going to make money on it
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:29.920]   because he's in effect selling shares in this to other people.
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:35.200]   Why would anybody buy a share of the JPEG? The absurd of the whole thing is, the idea of
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.320]   owning a piece of it is even harder for me to get my head around.
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:43.920]   Well, I guess I could liken it to a Haunas Wagner baseball card,
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:50.000]   which is on the face of it a piece of cardboard that's worth absolutely nothing,
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.320]   except it isn't. It's worth $3 million. Because there's only nine of them.
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:59.040]   And I would bet you most of the people who have Haunas Wagner cards really weren't Pittsburgh
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:06.720]   pirates fans in the 20s that wasn't what got them to buy that card. They bought that card because
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:11.440]   they presumed it would go up in value. Right? It's speculation.
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:16.320]   Is this the Beanie Babies of our generation? Yes, exactly.
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:21.360]   Yep. By the way, if anybody wants to buy my daughter's Beanie Babies.
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:29.440]   I have a large collection. Unfortunately, I'd bring them home and I'd say, "Don't open that.
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:33.200]   It's worth money." She'd open a play with it. That's you've destroyed it.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.160]   Right. Take photos of them and tell you what the NFT is.
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:44.000]   Have you had occasion to explain Nicholas to friends and family members what the hell's going
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:50.080]   on here? And if you have what words do you use? Right. Well, no, I have pitched this story to CR.
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:54.720]   It was until this past week. Not obscure. $69 million.
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:12:02.720]   No, I hear you. I hear you. I started pitching this NFT stuff maybe about a month ago because I
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:08.720]   am sort of fascinated by all this cryptocurrency stuff. But yeah, I guess my sort of take is when
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:14.160]   people ask friends, fam, is like, "I don't get it. Why would you pay $69 million for a JPEG?"
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:22.000]   It's like, "That's fine, sure." But I'm not big into, but I'm inside the NBA Topshop Discord
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.360]   all day. And there are thousands of people in there who are saying... Have you purchased any
[00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:30.560]   NBA highlights? Yes. $10 worth. I haven't even opened the packet, to be honest.
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:34.880]   What do you get? Oh, I'm really curious. They've spent, by the way, they've sold $200 million worth
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:40.320]   of NBA highlights. This is the NBA solo. Do some of that money go to the players in the highlight?
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:44.080]   I have no idea, to be honest. I don't know the... Do I have a million of that?
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:50.080]   But I liken it to digital trading cards. It's no different than if I were to play
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:58.720]   Magic the Gathering or Hearthstone. It's like, "Oh, I get this card." It might also be an age
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:03.680]   thing too, where it's like to a kid having an NBA highlight on his phone that he could show his
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:08.080]   friends and that he could say, "I own this." Whatever that means, it doesn't actually really
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:11.440]   matter. His friends are impressed by it. He feels cool that he owns it.
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:14.560]   Which highlight did you buy? I'm curious, Nicholas.
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:18.080]   I didn't even open the packet to me either. Even though you've got...
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:25.280]   I hope it's a good one, I guess. But yeah, if kids are into it, if they think it's neat,
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:31.440]   it's like, "I don't know why do I have to outsmart that kid?" He's having fun. That's fine.
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.400]   That seems okay to me. That's how I try to explain it to people. It's like,
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:39.600]   it is very weird. It's kind of odd. $69 million. Maybe there's some greater scheme behind it.
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:43.360]   There is a scheme, actually. In this case, there is, absolutely.
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.960]   This goes back to... There was Crypto Kitties in 2017.
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.560]   Yeah, it's just like Crypto Trays.
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:48.560]   Yeah.
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:51.920]   Digital hats. Crypto Kitties is still around, by the way.
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:56.640]   It's all very interesting. It's all like... What's very interesting to me about all this,
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:00.960]   and it's happening now. This is literally happening in real time. I can go into the
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:05.440]   NBA Topshop Discord and see this unfurling before my eyes.
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:10.960]   So what in there do they say like, "Anybody want a..." I don't know what...
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.560]   It's everything.
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:18.560]   Michael Jordan, "Nothing But Net" 3-pointer. Anybody want that? I got it from the 1967...
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:21.600]   Whatever. So is that the kind of stuff? Is that the kind of dialogue?
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:25.680]   It's that type of stuff. There's technical complaints. People saying, "Why does it take so long for it to come?"
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.040]   People complaining about bots.
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.440]   When it comes, what comes? Does something come in the mail?
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.520]   You go to the website and you go to the little section of the website,
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:38.880]   and then you get a digital card pack. Like you said a second ago, you buying trading cards.
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.640]   It's kind of a virtual trading card.
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:43.600]   Oh, so you were able to buy a site unseen. You don't know what you got.
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:45.520]   Oh, I have no idea. I'm going to open the pack.
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:47.680]   If I had that, I could do it.
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.200]   I could do it on the bottom.
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:50.880]   Yeah, no one else can have that.
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:52.880]   Okay, you have an exclusive access to this.
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:53.840]   I have a lot of people.
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:57.600]   This is where it does get interesting. It's like, I don't own the NBA owns this.
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:03.280]   This is the NBA's intellectual property. I think at most you can say that I have a license
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:10.720]   to say that this particular instance of this LeBron James play belongs to me.
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:17.920]   Is that worth $1,000 to you, to me? I don't know. But to the guy who bought it,
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:20.960]   I guess it is because he paid $1,000 for it.
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.720]   But belongs is an interesting word.
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.400]   Yeah.
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:30.320]   Belongs is so for instance, here's a perfect replication of a Honos Wagner,
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:35.280]   $3 million worth baseball card. I could print this out, put it on a piece of cardboard.
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:38.960]   I'd have it. It's not worth $3 million because it's not real.
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:45.280]   So one of the things that happens with NFTs is there is authentication.
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:50.080]   You can say with authority, this is signed by the NBA.
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:53.280]   I own whatever this is that I own.
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:57.040]   Right. It's sort of like a digital autograph where you could say,
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:00.640]   okay, this, yeah, of course, you could just take a screenshot and share it,
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:03.200]   put it on Twitter, who cares, or whatever the case may be.
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:08.000]   But this has been authenticated. This has been blessed by this.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:15.120]   This is digitally signed or autographed. It's imbued with special characteristics
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:19.120]   that people get a kick out of. That's kind of where we are.
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:21.760]   And people are trying to wrap their heads around like, I don't understand.
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:25.440]   Why would you even care? It's a valid question, but people do.
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.760]   And I don't know. It's kind of neat, I guess.
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:34.400]   I love the word imbued. It's like, yeah. And that boot was imbued with magic by Harry Potter.
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:38.320]   It's just, you know, it's like that. It's imbued in that sense.
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:45.680]   Well, you know, I'm honored to know that you would spend $5 on a 10-bit top shot.
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:46.640]   I think it was 10.
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.560]   10. Well, all right. Let's be fair.
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:50.400]   And I hope they're good.
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.040]   I'm very casual and be a fan of best. We'll see.
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:59.840]   If you get Steph Curry, 3-pointer, I'll buy it for 20. You've doubled your money.
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:04.960]   I'll consider it. There's a marketplace. So maybe you'll have to bid with other, maybe there's a
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.560]   scramble for that.
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.400]   Yeah, if you were smart, if you were smart.
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:12.240]   That's kind of the other part of the appeal of it is like, you know, do you own it?
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:16.560]   Who do you know, that's a little hazy, but you do have the right to kind of flip it,
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:19.840]   where it's like, okay, I've got this LeBron James or Steph Curry play.
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:25.360]   I'll put it on the NBA top shot marketplace and someone else can buy it.
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:29.760]   You know, if I paid, let's say $100 for it and this person wants to pay $500 for it,
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.840]   well, now I've just made $400.
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:37.360]   So there is that kind of speculative get rich quick and it does feel very, very young.
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:41.200]   It does feel like a lot of like kids are into this where there's kind of that,
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.200]   that like flipping culture or, you know,
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:46.320]   they were the people who brought GameStop two months ago.
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:46.800]   Oh, yes.
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:47.040]   Yeah.
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:51.600]   There's like there's a lot of overlap between that type of person who, you know, get rich
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:56.560]   quick. This is kind of fun, weird internet stuff, which is probably why you struggle to see
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:02.000]   kind of like mainstream outlets explain what this is because this is like weird internet culture,
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.960]   young people doing stuff that we don't quite understand.
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:07.360]   You just don't get it, man. You're too old to get it, man.
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:14.240]   Jason, is this, does this remind you of ICOs and another kind of blockchain related
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:19.360]   thing? I mean, ICOs kind of got in trouble. Remember initial coin offerings?
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:19.840]   It's true.
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:20.320]   Yeah.
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:28.800]   I think it has more legs than ICOs. I think that in this case, this is trying to solve a problem.
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:36.480]   So the web as we know it was not built for privacy, was not built for
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:45.840]   you know, exclusivity. Like when we look at a web page, when we look at when we an image
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:51.120]   or a video, we're not looking at the original, right? It's always copies.
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:55.200]   We're downloading constantly downloading copies. That's how the web was architected.
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:19:01.760]   And so that has a number of challenges around transferring value.
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:10.640]   So that's why blockchain came along in Bitcoin. And this is a similar phenomenon because
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:17.120]   you in the real world, if you have, you know, if someone owns the Mona Lisa, the Louvre in
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:24.160]   France owns the Mona Lisa, there are copies of the Mona Lisa everywhere, right? You can buy them
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:30.960]   very cheaply, but there is only one. And it is, you know, it exists there. You have to go there
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:35.520]   to see it. People go and pay a lot of money to go all the way to France and then to, you know,
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:41.200]   go to the Louvre and they want to see that one, even though it looks just like, as a matter of fact,
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:47.680]   the ones that you've seen a thousand other places, right? And why is that? Because we place,
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:53.760]   because people place a certain value on the one-of-a-kindness of it. And this is the same,
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:58.800]   this is the digital version of that one-of-a-kindness using cryptography, using blockchain
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:06.000]   technology to create this one-of-a-kindness around digital assets. And so just as you said,
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.800]   you know, there are certain types of valuable, non-fungible. Fungible is a word we don't use
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:17.200]   very often, but fungible just means like transferable, right? So a fungible asset is like my $20 bill
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:24.080]   and your $20 bill, Leo, they're worth the same. We could switch them and the value is exactly the
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:30.000]   same. But that's a fungible asset. A non-fungible asset is one where I have a beanie baby and you
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.600]   have the beanie babies and mine's worth five bucks and yours is worth 500 bucks or my baseball cards
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:41.760]   worth, you know, 20 cents and the one you've got the Hones Wagner, which is worth millions. And so,
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:47.760]   you know, the value of these things is like anything that they don't really have any intrinsic value
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:54.720]   other than in some sense supply and demand, but then also just how much people value them and the
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:59.360]   value of those things changes over time. So I think it's just a big way of saying there,
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:04.080]   we're going to see lots of this. And I think we're at the very beginning and it's going to be super
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:07.760]   interesting to watch. There's going to be people that make money. There's going to be people lose a
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:12.080]   lot of money. One of the other things that we haven't talked about that's kind of interesting is
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:19.680]   the idea of selling digital real estate. And so if you remember, I'm sure everybody on this
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:26.480]   call remembers second life. There was like, remember second life? Well, now there are other
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:33.120]   versions of that where like Earth two. So earth2.io, one of my colleagues has told me about this week,
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:39.520]   where you can go and literally buy property in Earth two. And the interesting thing is,
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:47.840]   even people are buying all kinds of things on there. And it's even just in the fast few months,
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:55.360]   the base value is double. That used to be $25 per kind of block. To buy my house and my yard
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:22:01.760]   is like four blocks. So now it's $50 per block. So it would cost me 200 bucks to buy my house,
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:07.280]   essentially, in Earth two. And anybody can go on there and do it. And people are already buying
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:13.120]   stadiums and famous landmarks and all this. I was like, well, you know what, I'll go in there
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:17.200]   and I'll buy the shopping center. There's like this one really nice shopping center,
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:23.760]   shopping area here in Louisville where I am. And I was like, well, I'll get that because that
[00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:29.200]   could actually, if this ends up taking off, it could be worth value. It would be like 30 grand
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:33.760]   for me to buy it. It's like the knopily, you know, boardwalk in the park place, right?
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:38.320]   It's right. It's right. So it is really interesting to look at this.
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:44.960]   Exactly. And you're shopping center. It really does. What it does makes you think about, well,
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:54.400]   what what do these words mean? Belong and ownership and tangible versus intangible,
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:59.840]   fungible versus what do these words mean? And why do we ascribe value to some things in others?
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:04.720]   Larry, I think our generation looks at this and says, no, I don't want to even think about it.
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.680]   You know, I just say crazy kids because it's nuts.
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:12.880]   If you talk about it, you know, I have a record collection. I used to buy records. Now, I didn't
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:17.840]   own the copyright to, you know, the rub, but you own the vinyl. I own the vinyl. Now, I mean,
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:22.720]   I can't remember the last time I paid money. You know, I just pay my $10 a month to Spotify and
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:27.120]   get all my music. But does that devalue the music? Because you don't have to go out. It's
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:31.280]   certainly devalued in my mind in a sense. I used to, I remember when, you know, it was a lot of money
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:36.000]   at the time. I would save up my money as a key. Ironically, these albums and music has become
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.280]   fungible. Yeah, ironically. You think the diamonds, why are diamonds so expensive?
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:46.720]   That's made up. It's completely made up. There is an industrial value to diamonds,
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:51.360]   but it turns out synthetic diamonds are just as in fact, maybe even more so industrially.
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:24:00.160]   Who's talking? Siri said that's what I figured. Okay. Siri, I don't know. Siri has an opinion on
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:06.720]   this, apparently. But yeah, that's effective. Of course, as we know, the beers worked very
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:11.840]   hard to create artificial scarcity. So the diamonds would be worth something. And of course, I have
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:16.800]   artwork with, I have some signed prints, you know, one of 20, one of 100. And you have to trust that
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:21.840]   the artist doesn't actually run off more because you know, who would know. But you know, there's
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:30.320]   always been a market in that. It's it is it is tempting for a certain generation. I'll put Larry
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:37.600]   and I and me in that generation to say, Oh, this is just those crazy digital kids. Yeah,
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:43.840]   this has nothing to do with a real work and a dollars pay for a dollars work and all that. And
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:50.400]   get off my virtual get off my version. And yet, frankly, money has always been this way. Money's
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:54.560]   made up a dollar bill has no intrinsic value. It's only because we say it does.
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:25:00.960]   That to me is also what's started because it's also that it's connected to blockchain and all
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:06.400]   this all these cryptocurrency. You know, we've had Bitcoin has been around roughly for 10 years and
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:12.080]   sort of like mainstream news coverage. And you know, why is that worth anything? Why? Well,
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:17.440]   because we say it is. It's worth something. Right. And if you try to have a conversation with
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:21.680]   someone who refuses to like meet you halfway and be like, well, I don't get it. This is weird.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:26.480]   It's like, OK, that's that's fine. But some number of people have decided that Bitcoin is worth
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:34.480]   roughly $60,000 today. That's what's amazing. Yeah. It's gone up. In fact, I laughed when Elon
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:41.280]   Musk's Tesla bought $1.5 billion in Bitcoin. They made a billion dollars on that investment already.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:47.280]   If they sold a day, the question is, is it going up more or is it going to plummet or
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:53.280]   and no one knows because it's pure speculation. It's too little bulbs. It's it's.
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:59.520]   But don't you feel like an idiot if you aren't if you didn't buy in early and you see all these
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:04.400]   people making hundreds of millions of dollars on small investments and I think that's actually
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:09.040]   what's going on is that a lot of this money that's floating around for NFTs is Bitcoin billionaires.
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:13.520]   People who made and there aren't many who made a lot of money on Bitcoin,
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:20.080]   at a pure luck. I mean, really, and they need something else to invest in. And so they're buying
[00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:26.400]   NFTs. I just feel like the bubble will burst at some point, but maybe not.
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:31.280]   It's interesting PayPal is now selling crypto. I noticed that accidentally the other day,
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:35.920]   I went on to PayPal to pay somebody some money and there was a crypto link and I clicked on it.
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:41.360]   And I have never bought crypto before, but because they made it so, so I dabbled. I mean,
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:44.400]   I didn't buy enough that if I lose the money, I'm going to I'm going to sweat over it.
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:48.240]   But now it's tempting every time I go on pay for crypto.
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:53.360]   Because there are people who have Bitcoin that cost them, you know, five bucks, it's now worth
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:58.240]   500,000 bucks. Yeah. Mine's gone up like a few pennies since I bought it last night.
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:01.760]   I mean, it's kind of funny to watch it go up and down in almost real time.
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:12.320]   I'm just checking Jack Dorsey's first tweet, which he tweeted March 21st, 2006, almost exactly 15
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:19.760]   years ago. It'll be 15 years ago when this auction ends. Currently, $2.5 million is the
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:24.480]   bid. And there's a little edge. You can see there's a bidding war. The second highest bid
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:33.280]   is kind of interesting. Justin Sun Tron, he is the creator of the Tron Bitcoin currency.
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:37.520]   He was also bidding for people's $60 million
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:47.600]   painting. And in fact, Justin Sun was pissed off. He said, I bid with 30 seconds left, I
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:53.120]   upped my bid to $70 million. But Christie's didn't accept it, even though there was was a
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:59.920]   20 seconds left. So he thinks he should have won that he might look back on this and say,
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:08.000]   but he could still get in on the I imagine this Jack Dorsey tweet, which will continue.
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:13.920]   The auction will continue, I think through the 21st. I bet you now, after that $60 million
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:16.560]   Christie's auction, this will go up by quite a bit.
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:19.280]   What do you do with it? Yeah, once you own it.
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:25.680]   Nothing. It's nothing. You sell if you're lucky, you sell it.
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:30.160]   You sell it. You sell it. Yeah. I mean, well, if that's a whole mis-wagon that just essentially,
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:33.520]   what is what I mean, if you own a if you own that baseball card or you own that bean,
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:37.520]   baby, I guess you could take it out and look at it once in a while, although you probably shouldn't,
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:42.320]   because every time you do you're you're reducing the value. Really what you should just put it in
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:48.160]   a safe and then wait till somebody offers you more. And then you sell it to them. So all these
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:52.240]   guys are doing is eliminating the stuff in the safe. It's in a better.
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:56.800]   What's the value? Is your ability to say you own it, right? Just as if you, what's the value of
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:02.160]   you having a honus wagner is usually able to tell other people who actually care about such a thing
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:06.960]   that you own a honus, a honus, a honus, a wagner. Well, in the case of Medi-Kovan, who bought the
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:16.880]   people. Yeah. What a world we live in. The value to him is what the shares he could sell. And if
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:22.480]   he can share more sales shares than he then he's put into it, then the value to him is real money.
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:28.160]   I would be embarrassed to tell somebody that I own a multi-million dollar piece of digital real
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:32.800]   estate, which has no intrinsic value. I mean, I don't know. I would just seem like the people
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:38.880]   bought moon real estate, right? People bought real estate on Mars.
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:45.600]   They're eventually people also buy they name stars after their, you know, stars after their
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:48.800]   relatives. You really don't really get anything with that complete scam.
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:54.000]   There is also, and this is there's a debate going on, but there is also a
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:01.040]   societal cost to this because these cryptocurrencies use a lot of energy.
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:07.120]   And a lot of what this speculation is going on is, and there's a big debate over this. I bet you
[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:12.800]   you're a little, you're discord, you're your top shots discord. They might even discuss it there.
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:19.760]   There's a lot of energy wasted on calculating with proofs of work and proof of stake stuff
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:24.880]   in these transactions. I'm not sure that I've seen a lot of debate about
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:30.240]   how they're not. It's an understandable question, and we should be talking about.
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:34.800]   But I mean, I would love to read that story, you know, talking to the kids who are buying
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:38.480]   top shots, talking to the kids who are buying NFTs. What does that actually into your mind when
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:43.680]   you're purchasing this, the vast energy cost? I don't know that I've actually seen that interview,
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:47.920]   but I've seen those concerns and those are valid concerns, but you have to ask the person
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:52.480]   doing the purchasing. Do you care? And the kids in the top shot room, I have not seen that.
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:54.800]   Then bring it up. They probably don't want to think about it.
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:58.640]   I have a question to find out. I do find it a bar of gold, and I have it in a safe, and as
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:02.880]   long as the safest and broken into and the building doesn't burn down, that bar of gold isn't going
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:07.200]   anywhere. Power failure is, you know, you name it. Is there a way you could lose this? I mean,
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:12.080]   what if the machine, you know, if we have an energy crisis and we can no longer continue to
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:16.880]   invest this energy into Bitcoin and it's current, do it go away? I mean, there are some risks we
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:20.400]   can lose it? Well, there's no tangible Bitcoin. All there is is the blockchain. Now,
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:26.480]   NFTs are done in Ethereum, so it is somewhat different from Bitcoin, but Bitcoin, when you have a
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:32.480]   Bitcoin wallet, the first thing you do is you download the blockchain, which at this point is
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:38.000]   well over 100 gigabytes worth of data. And the blockchain contains every transaction from the
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:43.760]   moment Satoshi Nakamoto launched this thing to the moment you opened the wallet.
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:47.280]   That's every transaction, including all the transactions you've made, but all the transactions
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:51.440]   everyone's made. So every single person who has a Bitcoin wallet has a copy of that
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:56.560]   blockchain. You can prune it. I mean, there's exceptions to that. But in effect, that blockchain
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:02.640]   is that's the whole point. It's it is a ledger of transactions that has no central, it's not
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:08.960]   centralized, it's not kept by a bank, it's not kept by a federal reserve. It's kept by everybody
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:17.120]   who engages who uses this. And so as a result, I think they would argue it's more safe than if
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:23.600]   you had a gold in the safe deposit ball. So my copy is valuable. I mean,
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:30.000]   it's that's what I use validate my ownership. That's right. The security and the cryptography
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:38.080]   is really the trust. So this is decentralized trust. A lot of trust, the trust in the US dollar
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:43.120]   is essentially trust in the US government and that that the US government will not fail and that
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:48.720]   if something if there is some kind of crash or something that the US government is backing
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:56.400]   the dollar, that trust is in institutions today. Same thing with banks. Banks are stores of trust
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:03.840]   more than they are stores of value. There's you put money and value there because you trust they
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:09.120]   will be there and that if you put it there, you'll be able to get it back. And it's the same with
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:15.840]   that's the intrinsic value of Bitcoin is that it is the most secure of these cryptocurrencies or
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:25.040]   that it is going to be there if you place value in it. And obviously, the thing that is
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:30.880]   a question is that value has been really volatile, right? It fluctuates greatly.
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:38.320]   And that will eventually even out likely as there are more larger institutions that put more
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:47.920]   in it. But it's really a trust game and and decentralizing trust. Bitcoin came out after
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:56.480]   the bank bailouts of 2009 and the sort of the failures that happened in the system and it is
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:01.120]   trying to address that. But I do want to address one other thing is like this power issue because I
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:10.880]   feel like this is the media re brings this up this issue up again and again without very much
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:16.640]   context at all. I feel like this is a lot of fun being driven by probably banking industry
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:24.160]   people because the banks use way more power than what Bitcoin does. And the banks are using dirty
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:31.840]   power in most cases. And a lot of these Bitcoin things are run off of much cleaner forms of energy
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:40.240]   and they use far less energy than these dirty energy that all these bank data centers are run
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:46.080]   off of. And even if I think there's some accounts out there that even if Bitcoin
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:53.200]   itself were to mature by more than 100 times its current size, it still would only equal 2%
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:59.520]   of all energy consumption. So there's a lot of a sort of false narrative out there about this power
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:05.920]   issue. And I feel like it's getting propagated. I don't know this, but I do feel like a lot of it
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:11.760]   gets propagated by the people who have a lot to lose because there's a lot of institutions that
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:19.440]   have a lot to lose if Bitcoin starts to replace fiat currency over the next 5 to 10 years,
[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:24.080]   which it is likely to do fiat currencies as well as as gold as a store of value.
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:26.800]   That's a really interesting point. Anybody know what this is?
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:28.720]   Ruckett, you're recognizing this Leo? Yes, I do.
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:33.920]   Well, the bank book. Yeah. When you would put money in your savings account, the teller would
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:40.160]   right in there your deposit. That's your ledger right there. 1982, I had $500 with a value. Now,
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:45.120]   the sad part of this bank has gone out of business. And I have no idea what this $500 would be
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:49.680]   worth today if I could actually collect it. And the state of Massachusetts has no record of it,
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:53.840]   unfortunately. Oh, dear. But that's the bad news. But the good news that is written down in Black
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:57.680]   and White. I love it that you have your bank books still. Your savings books still have it.
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:01.760]   Do they do that? They don't do that anymore. Do they? Oh, god, no. No, what I do do, and this
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:05.840]   call me paranoid. So here's my folder of all my savings. So I can use that.
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:11.520]   That's savings account. I can't see it. Anyway, because I do worry that one day I'm going to
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:16.560]   log into my checking account or my investment account and that money that I know is there for
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:21.360]   whatever reason won't show up. Well, but see, and this is why us oldsters don't want to think
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:27.280]   about this. Because the truth is that money isn't there. Of course. There's no money anywhere.
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:31.760]   That's bits. There's a record of it. There's a record of it is all that exists. And it's a record
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:38.720]   that is probably less reliable than blockchain. Your bank books proof of that. That bank book
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:43.200]   has a record that you have $500. Good luck finding it. If it were on the blockchain,
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:50.400]   at least you'd be able to claim it. So I think that one of the problems with this is it raises
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:56.720]   issues that make people not want to... I mean, I do think there's an energy issue. I agree with you,
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:37:02.960]   Jason. It could be that's cleaner energy. There's a very good article by Everest Pippkin on Medium,
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:09.120]   where he claims that Ethereum, which has always supposedly been moving to the
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:16.400]   more ecologically friendly proof of stake hasn't yet never will. It's kind of one of those someday
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:25.840]   things. But it uses, I think, 24 terawatts of power a year. University of New Mexico study
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:33.440]   estimated about 50 cents in ecological damage for every dollar of Bitcoin generated. That's half.
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:40.960]   So I think that you could say that there is a consequence to this. Maybe it isn't a problem,
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:46.320]   but it's got to be something to be thought about. But I think it's the same... So I'm sorry, Leo.
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:50.000]   You're right. The banks are also dirty. I agree. I agree. I mean...
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.280]   You have to apply it equally, I think, though. If it's like, I understand we should be
[00:37:55.280 --> 00:38:03.680]   very responsible about the way we use power, and we should be always looking for ways to make it
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:10.640]   more efficient. But we have to apply the same thing. The ways that we have to apply it to say
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:17.360]   every time you buy a new car, here's how much energy you are putting in an electric car.
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:24.320]   Yeah. No, I just bought a new electric car. And of course, it's a ridiculous personal ownership
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:33.200]   of automobiles is economically horrific. They get used maybe one tenth or one 20th of the time.
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:38.240]   They just sit there for most of the time. There's no good economic justification for that.
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:44.560]   So I think you're right, Jason, in the sense that all this crypto stuff is just new. And so,
[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:51.520]   oh gosh, it's economically devastating, but the familiar ecologically devastating stuff
[00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:55.760]   that we do every single day, we go, well, that's life. That's normal.
[00:38:55.760 --> 00:39:02.480]   It's just how much water I use every day in our house. We don't think about the impact of that,
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:09.440]   or the fact that we are recycling, but we don't have any place to send that recycling to China
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:12.960]   is not buying our recycling anymore. So really, most of that's actually going in the trash.
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:17.280]   So we feel good about recycling, but it's really not. Do it anything. Yeah.
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:21.920]   So they're all the other. You're the kind of person nobody invites to a party, by the way.
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:27.760]   Stop telling us. That's no good. Don't mention that. Nobody wants to know that.
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:31.840]   No, actually, that's, I think to me, that's why this whole thing is interesting. It challenges a lot
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:41.120]   of our accepted notions of what belonging is, what value is, what environmental protection is.
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:47.120]   That's why I love it too. I have friend talking to Bitcoin cryptocurrencies. They just refuse to
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:54.320]   get it. A dollar you can hold, I can go to the store, I can buy a cup of coffee. It's real to them.
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:40:00.400]   But they refuse to accept that the reason why that's real is because a certain quorum of people
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:04.800]   have decided that it is real and we use it and we run with it. But why can't we decide that
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:09.920]   Bitcoin is worth something or Ethereum or Bunny coins or whatever the heck it is?
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:15.840]   NBA Topshot highlights. Yeah. That's, I mean, is super interesting that like debate or that
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:20.960]   processing that we all do, like what is stepping, zooming out? What is actually happening here?
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:27.040]   How do we think about this stuff? It's truly fascinating. And as I said, I don't think
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:32.240]   people of my age or Larry's age really want to think about the fact that we're hoping to retire
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:38.800]   on something that is really just bits poorly kept in some banks ledger. I mean, there is no,
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:43.440]   I think that's why there was for a long time, let's get back to the gold standard. As if
[00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:48.480]   somehow tying the dollar to gold would somehow make it real, make it tangible, make it something.
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:54.240]   It's not. It's just another thing. And the gold is no, the industrial value of gold is nowhere near the,
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:41:02.160]   but it's 35, $100. So if you know, I bought a Tesla couple of years ago, and the Tesla is
[00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:07.920]   worth, according to now Kelly Blue Book, I spent about 64. It's worth about 36 now.
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:13.840]   But $10,000 of that value is software is the autopilot, the full self-driving software,
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:18.560]   which has actually no value because Tesla can recreate it anytime they want.
[00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:26.640]   And so the idea that something, a third of the value of my car is something completely intangible.
[00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:36.240]   Yeah, basically, and you bought a golf cart that had the gloss of Elon Musk. It was imbued.
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:43.120]   It was the magic of Musk. And I bought one too, by the way, I got a bottle X. I always spent a lot
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:48.160]   more than that. And he claims it's going to go up in value, which is hard because they keep going
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:54.080]   down in value. Well, if the thing is, you also, that was a little bit of speculation too, Larry,
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:42:00.800]   and maybe some wise one, because like there's by some of the analysts estimates, Tesla has
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:08.720]   somewhere between, depending on who you believe, that 30% to like 45% chance of getting this self-driving
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:13.120]   piece right there, they're like literally five years ahead of everybody else because just they
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:19.920]   have so much data because they've had the feature out there longer and all the users are beta testers.
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:28.640]   But if they do get that right, then that value of that 10,000 that you put in that is probably
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:33.280]   worth closer to like 50 grand. Because you could must decide to lower the cost, which he could do
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:40.560]   in a whim. Sure. It's up to him. I knew every moment of the way that I was wasting my money when I
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:48.400]   bought the bio, what was the biohazard protection mechanism, AKHepa filter in the car, and has the
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:53.280]   biohazard logo on it. But I knew that, but I wanted, and this is the intangible you're talking
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:43:01.360]   about, Jason, I wanted to support Elon Musk's mission to electrify cars. I knew I was contributing
[00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:07.760]   to that, that it was a donation, not a purchase value. It was a transfer of value that you felt
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:13.840]   good about. And that's, for me, it was a mission on my college education about autonomous driving.
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:18.720]   I know more about autonomous driving, even though my car is barely level two, then I would have
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:22.560]   known had I not owned a Tesla. That's a good rationale. Are you in the beta? That is a good
[00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:26.240]   rationale. You know, not yet. I don't know how to get in the beta. He said, could enjoy the beta,
[00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:30.960]   but he never told you how to sign up for it. Yeah, it's one of those like, don't call us,
[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:34.640]   we'll call you kind of. And I call my friend in the PR department, but they laid her and
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:41.040]   everybody else. They have a whole PR department. They don't need a PR department. We got Elon's
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:45.520]   Twitter. That's all we need. It's all anybody needs. That is their PR department. It's too
[00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:51.600]   mature to answer. Let's take a little break. Before we get, before my mind is blown,
[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:58.160]   and I decide I can't ever retire. We have a fantastic panel. I'm so glad to add Nicholas
[00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:04.160]   they lay on to our list of, I hope regulars on Twitter, senior electronics reporter at Consumer
[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:09.760]   Reports. It's really nice to have you on the show. Are you in New York? Yes, I am. All right. We're
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:15.200]   in New York. I'm in the Hudson Valley of New York. Consumer Reports is based in Yonkers,
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:20.640]   which is about 30 minutes north of the city. And then I'm about another hour or so north of there.
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:26.400]   Oh, my daughter went to Bard. I love that area. Are you anywhere near where Pete Siger lived
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:32.240]   during his lifetime? I don't know where he lived. He saved the Hudson River. He lived on a sailboat
[00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:37.040]   for a long time going up and down the Hudson River to save it. But you live in one of the most
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:41.040]   beautiful parts of America. It's just, I mean, there are many, but that's 40. It's typical suburbs,
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:48.480]   but it's OK. It's a little longer. Pecipsee. Yeah, yeah. That's very pretty, very pretty area.
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:55.600]   Also, Larry Maggot, who is, what you're just going to say, your affiliation is with Connect Safely.org.
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:45:00.480]   I love your Kennedy bumper sticker that you got. That is signed by JFK.
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:06.720]   What? I personally handed it to him when I was whatever age, when he was running for president,
[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:09.840]   when he was appearing in the San Fernando Valley, and he scribbled his name on it.
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:14.720]   So you don't need that authenticated because you were there. You know that's his signature.
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:18.720]   What's the worth of the blockchain? Who knows? And who cares? It's what is it worth to you? And
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:23.120]   that is worth that's in fact, it's in priceless, right? I would imagine. And if you look carefully,
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:27.120]   you can see a signature, but not from here. Well, I have to say we have the best picture we've ever
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:30.960]   had from you. So I can. That's probably been there the whole time, you know, every time you're on,
[00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:35.520]   but I finally see it. So that's great. That's awesome. Next to it, a typewriter.
[00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:39.760]   That typewriter, I actually learned a type on when I was a kid. Wow. That was my typewriter.
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:44.080]   So yeah, just, and you see my camera? I see your cameras. You threw everything out. That's my
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:50.160]   mistake. All the old stuff. I never saved anything. What was I thinking? Also, Jason Heiner, my dear
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:56.560]   friend from now editorial director at CNET. Always a pleasure to see you. And you're in Louisville
[00:45:56.560 --> 00:46:03.840]   still or no? Louisville, Kentucky. Yes, sir. Beautiful Louisville. I was talking the other day
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:09.520]   about the Louisville Slugger plant, because I have a Louisville Slugger somebody gave me for a
[00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:14.080]   hundredth anniversary, a hundredth twit, which we are well past now and we're up to 800.
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:22.480]   But that has a giant Louisville Slugger out front. And I love that. Yes. It's the largest bat in the
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:30.560]   world. The biggest bat in the world. I love it. Great to have all three of you. Our show today
[00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:36.160]   brought to you by Forward Networks. This is a really cool technology. I got a little demo of it
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:45.280]   created by four Stanford PhD students. They said, we developed an empathy for the network operator.
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:53.120]   We felt so bad because running a network is this. I mean, it's a little bit of voodoo. It's a little
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:57.600]   bit of science. But the problem is there's a lot of mystery. When you run a network,
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:04.000]   that's why they draw the cloud as a puffy little cloud that stuff goes in and happens and then
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:11.360]   comes out. They wanted to reduce business risk by revolutionizing the way large networks are
[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:16.800]   managed. Seven years ago, they founded Forward Networks, part of their work at Stanford,
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:23.680]   to apply principles of modern software to the network. So this software, Forward Networks, does
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:30.560]   delivers a digital twin of your network, completely accurate mathematical model in software.
[00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:36.160]   They have tools that go out and crawl the network, find every device. A couple of years ago,
[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:40.800]   NASA had a problem because one of the engineers brought a Raspberry Pi in and put it on the network
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:45.120]   and they couldn't figure out, well, what was causing these issues? Well, if you had forward
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:49.520]   networks, you would see that Raspberry Pi immediately would be added to this digital twin.
[00:47:49.520 --> 00:47:55.280]   And you would know, here's what you can do with this. You can verify that your network is configured
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:48:02.080]   to spec, that it's in compliance with policies that's behaving as intended, even more important
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:08.000]   these days. Before you make a change to the network, you can actually simulate it and predict the
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:14.160]   impact of that change across every possible traffic path. I mean, how many times have we
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:21.200]   heard stories about a network operator changing their their BGP router tables and accidentally
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:27.360]   routing all internet traffic to a small town in Maine, it happens not with Forward Networks.
[00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:31.440]   Dashboard gives you key network insights with visualizations. If you're watching the video,
[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:36.000]   you're seeing them that are easily consumable. They can be exported. You actually love it because
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.480]   you can show the board and your CEO, what's going on in a way that everybody can get.
[00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:44.800]   But it's an always accurate network diagram with all the details about the topology of your
[00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:50.720]   environment. If you're a sys admin, if you run a network, I know you want this. You can search,
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:55.520]   it's going to search, you could search network behavior, configuration and state network wide.
[00:48:55.520 --> 00:49:00.880]   It's got an intuitive and powerful search tool. You can perform end to end path analysis across
[00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:06.640]   your network on both on-prem and cloud infrastructure. You can proactively identify potential connectivity
[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:13.600]   and security policy violations. This goes all the way to the endpoints. From your servers to the
[00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:18.800]   endpoints, they have this thing. Now, if you're geek, you know about diffs, where you take two
[00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:22.560]   text files, you run a diff and you know what the differences are. You can see how the edits are made.
[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:29.120]   Forward Networks gives you behavioral diffs side by side comparison in one quick view
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:32.960]   of what your network looks like now and what it's going to look like after you change these
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:38.480]   configuration files. Between any points in time, you'll get 50% faster resolution of network
[00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:43.040]   trouble tickets because you're not in mystery anymore. You'll get 90% faster fixes related to
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:48.880]   audit processes, 33% reduction in aborted network updates due to identified errors.
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:54.400]   Turn it off, turn it off. Oh my God. Oh my God. Imagine searching your network for what's causing
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:59.840]   the problems. I mean, even better predicting the problem before it happens. That's forward networks
[00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:04.160]   used by some of the biggest companies in the world. Telstra uses it in Australia, Bank of America,
[00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:09.120]   Verizon uses it, Goldman Sachs uses it. In fact, they loved it so much. They led their
[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:15.360]   series C funding round. Mark Andreessen of Andreessen Horowitz, big fan. He was also in on the funding
[00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:21.920]   round as was threshold, $65 million round, a very successful round. I love the story about PayPal.
[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:28.480]   They were having troubles with their network. They thought about maybe we should build
[00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:32.160]   something. They really thought conceptualize something like forward networks. But when they
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:36.560]   found it, they said, "This is better than what we were going to do." They found all the trouble
[00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:42.960]   spots that saved them time and money. You need this thing. Get network automation and verification
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:50.160]   for your intent-based network with forward networks. Your business depends on it. There's an amazing
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:54.960]   demo. You've been seeing some of it if you're watching the video at forwardnetworks.com/twit.
[00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:59.120]   You're going to play with this thing. If you're not the decision maker in your business,
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:04.320]   just take your boss to forwardnetworks.com/twit, say, "I've got to show you this."
[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:09.280]   They've got a new podcast to you. You might want to check out it. I love the name Seeking Truth in
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:17.440]   Networking. Wherever you get your podcast, you can find that. Forwardnetworks.com/twit.
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:23.200]   This is research that turned into something every network operator has to have. It's pretty amazing.
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:26.960]   Thank you forward networks for supporting Twitch.
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:37.680]   Apple has announced that the HomePod is gone. This is kind of... I was skeptical. Five years ago,
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:45.680]   when they announced the big $400 HomePod and they... Matthew Panzareno, they take him into...
[00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:50.880]   We've got 50 anechoic chambers. We built just to design this thing. We brought the best sound
[00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:56.560]   engineers in the world. This is the best speaker you can get for this size. They sold it like crazy.
[00:51:56.560 --> 00:52:03.760]   And just like... I remember Steve Jobs coming on stage. Remember they sold the iPod Hi-Fi
[00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:09.600]   thing? And Steve Jobs said, "I'm getting rid of all my high-end audio equipment. This sounds
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:16.800]   so good." They canceled that within a year, by the way. I hope Steve Jobs got his stereo back.
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:26.000]   I don't know. People liked the sound. To me, it wasn't even as good as the Google Home Max,
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:31.360]   which sold for about the same price. Now Apple's done so well with the mini version of this,
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:36.800]   the $100 version of this. They're just discontinuing it. Should we mourn the end of the HomePod?
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:46.000]   No. Did you review this at all, Nicholas, for CU? I did not, but we did. And I think our
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:50.960]   assessment was similar to yours where we thought the Google Home Max sounded better. I remember
[00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:58.800]   that. Yes. Yeah, I don't know. I personally bought the mini for my father. He seems to like it. He's
[00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:03.600]   a big Apple guy. He's got an iPad. He's got Apple music. He loves this Siri. He's always asking,
[00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:08.720]   "If you like Siri, it's nice to have Siri in the house." He seems to like it. I know these
[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:14.640]   little speakers. I personally own the Sonos One. I think it sounds fine. I guess I'm not the most
[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:20.880]   critical listener. It's funny. I saw a joke on Twitter a couple of weeks ago that sound quality
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:25.440]   actually peaked in the '80s with the CD. And now we're listening to compressed Spotify.
[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:28.560]   We don't care anymore. It's true. People don't care. We don't care.
[00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:33.600]   And for most people who grew up listening to those little white headphones coming out of the
[00:53:33.600 --> 00:53:38.960]   iPod to highly compressed, lossy music, the mini's probably sound just as good as the home.
[00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:44.080]   One reason I don't mourn the loss of the homepot is that I have a little echo
[00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:47.600]   daughter or something, but I say, "Box for practically nothing." 50 bucks.
[00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:53.440]   30 bucks. Yeah. Hooked up to a very nice speaker system. They've got ways to hook them up to a
[00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:59.120]   nice speaker. So you don't have to buy a high-end smart speaker. You can buy a dumb one and hook it
[00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:05.920]   up to whatever you want to. I feel like Apple's hype machine over hyped the homepot. They would
[00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:10.560]   have saved themselves a lot of time in trouble if they only built half as many outgoing chambers.
[00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:17.680]   And they didn't sell a $350 speaker because people are happy with a $100 speaker. I have
[00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:22.720]   five minis. I have two homepods. I'm an idiot. I also have a lot of Sonos gear,
[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:28.880]   including that Sonos one. I would say that the Google Home Max, which I also have,
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:33.360]   that big speaker, they discontinued as well. I think nobody's buying $400 or $300 speakers
[00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:38.080]   is the real part. Yeah. This is the little thing you can buy from Amazon. It's a...
[00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:41.120]   Look at that puck. It doesn't have a speaker into it all. They're like $20.
[00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:44.080]   Yeah. It gives you echo. All the echo can release.
[00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:47.520]   But I have a question. This is what I have hooked up to a fairly good speaker system.
[00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:53.040]   It sounds great. Yeah. No, that's all you need. And if you want good speakers, you buy
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:55:00.320]   good powered speakers or even... I got good old-fashioned stereo speakers and hooked them up to
[00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:06.160]   an amplifier. And then I can hook all that stuff up into that. So, yeah. It's... There's also some
[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:11.760]   really good sound bars too. So, I think that the death of this thing might be... There's a lot of
[00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:17.840]   really... We've seen it reviews a lot of these and has some good lists as well as reviews of some of
[00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:24.080]   them. Sonos has some great ones. Sonos has some really nice sound bars. If you want to do high-end
[00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:29.840]   audio like this, you're better off just getting a sound bar, connecting it to your TV. And then
[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:35.760]   you can also use it for this kind of high-end audio too. So, this was just a... It's a product
[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:40.240]   without a market or the market has gotten squeezed out because you're either going low-end for
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:46.320]   $100 or less with a little puck. Or if you're going to go with really better quality,
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:51.120]   higher-end audio, you're probably just going to go with a sound bar and there are great ones out
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:56.160]   there for great prices too. Yeah. Yeah, the Vizio sound bar starts under $100.
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:56:04.560]   I like that little Apple AirPineas because I'm like your dad, Nicholas. I like Siri. Hello,
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:12.400]   Siri. No, I like... Actually, use it to AirPlay 2. And to me, if you have iOS devices,
[00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:18.080]   AirPlay 2 is great. And having AirPlay 2 device you can play to is very nice. But you don't need
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:25.600]   I guess they dropped the price to $250. I think Apple misunderstood the market. If you're a high-end
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:32.240]   audio file, you're not going to buy a $300 speaker. And if you're not a high-end audio file,
[00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:36.880]   you're not going to buy a $300 speaker. So, it's going to buy this thing. Nobody.
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:42.320]   And the market kind of changed out from under them, right? It just... It went in two different
[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:50.880]   directions, lower cost for the pucks. And then the... People are doing really well selling these
[00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:54.160]   sound bars. Those were one of the top selling items during the pandemic. Really? It was people
[00:56:54.160 --> 00:57:00.880]   were like, "Oh, I can hook up a sound bar to my system, keep the TV I've got and get really
[00:57:00.880 --> 00:57:06.640]   actually a much nicer experience." And that replaced, I think, a lot of what people that would have
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:12.960]   bought some of these homepot, the high-end homepot or the Google as well.
[00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:19.280]   Where do you think the market's going, Jason, with voice assistants? It feels like it's kind of
[00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:33.120]   plateaued. Yeah. So, Amazon and Google are still selling more of these things. They are moving
[00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:37.760]   toward the screen-enabled ones, right? That's where they're putting most of their energy.
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:41.440]   Yeah. Amazon has now has an echo show that follows you around and watches you.
[00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:49.040]   Yeah. That's creepy. That's creepy. The Facebook product. The portal. Yeah. The portal.
[00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:57.280]   Yeah. So, they're going in that direction. I mean, most users still are just like what
[00:57:57.280 --> 00:58:02.800]   Larry mentioned. Those pucks, they're much more interested in that. It's much more practical.
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:07.360]   You can put them wherever you want them. As you said, Leo, you can put them in different rooms.
[00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:13.600]   You can get five of them. The price is still pretty minimal, relatively. And so,
[00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:20.480]   that makes a lot more sense. But the software behind them has plateaued a bit.
[00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:26.480]   Certainly, that's where more work needs to be done. The hardware part has largely been
[00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:34.800]   solved or at least it's not rapidly developing all of that much. But the software has a lot of
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:40.880]   work to be done. It's not going anywhere. It might be, maybe I'm an outlier. But mostly,
[00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:47.440]   I use it for timing cooking pretty much, right? That's like top five. So, the most used things.
[00:58:47.440 --> 00:58:52.880]   Maybe I'll ask it to play music sometimes. Nicholas, do you use these or is it just your dad?
[00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:59.440]   Mostly him. I use my sonas primarily to get the weather every now and then.
[00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:05.600]   Your sonas one has echo built in, right? It has Google Assistant. And I have a hook
[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:08.560]   to Google Assistant. You have to choose one or the other, right?
[00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:13.280]   Correct. Yeah. So, you chose Google Assistant. I used to turn the lights on.
[00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:18.080]   How I turn the lights off of my bedroom? I have a few lights and I tell every time I go to bed,
[00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:21.760]   I say Google turn off the lights. And half the time it does.
[00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:25.600]   Thousands of lights around the country just got you a lot of things. Half the time it does.
[00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:30.080]   No, I left out the hey or no. Do you have to say the hey? No, you have to say okay.
[00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:36.080]   Yeah, I left the okay. I know it'll be funny. I tried. That's by the way, I didn't tell you
[00:59:36.080 --> 00:59:41.520]   Nicholas. We try not to use the A word for that very reason. We call it echo. Although,
[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:45.520]   the poor people who've changed their keyword to echo are really.
[00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:50.000]   I had to do that because I have an echo in my living room and I have one in my kitchen and
[00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:52.320]   there's actually no real wall between them. They have different names.
[00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:55.680]   So, they have to have different names. They're other way by kitchen response when I'm talking
[00:59:55.680 --> 01:00:01.680]   to my living room or vice versa. I feel like, Assistant, what I use it for is very simple.
[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:06.640]   And I think our readers as well. I don't know how too many folks are doing very complicated.
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:12.000]   It's smart home stuff. It's cooking timers. It is echo play this song.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.360]   Music and timers. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:19.600]   Which is probably why the software is not evolving. I found I'd never seen this before.
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:23.760]   Apparently, Amazon put this online a couple of weeks ago. These day one editions.
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:31.920]   The idea is it's kind of like an indie go-go for echo devices. So, Amazon is saying,
[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:37.200]   here's three different concepts. All have echo built in. One is a cuckoo clock.
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:43.520]   Really? One is a smart scale, which looks like a regular kitchen scale. I guess, though,
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:48.880]   you can ask echo for nutrition info. This is the, I actually pre-ordered this one.
[01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:51.280]   The smart sticky note printer, because I'm an idiot.
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:57.120]   Really? Because I'm an idiot. And I buy this crap. 88 bucks. But what it does is you can't,
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:01.360]   it doesn't have echo in it, but you pair it to an echo device. I have a clock paired to an
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:07.680]   echo device as well. And then so you can say echo, print my shopping list or echo,
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:12.240]   and then you get a post-it note. Can you actually give data a quick note?
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:18.480]   I'll let you know when I get it. This one got funded. So, this item is going to get built.
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:25.280]   It made its goal on day three. Can't say as much for the cuckoo clock. The cuckoo clock is still,
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:29.200]   still, they got to work a little more work to go. They're about halfway to their goal.
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:34.400]   This is actually smart. Amazon's getting all this consumer information, aren't they?
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:41.360]   $80 for the cuckoo clock. The smart scale is a little cheaper. 35 bucks.
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:46.800]   I have a smart microwave, which isn't really that smart. But in theory, I can tell it to
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:52.240]   cook an egg and it will do so on command. You have the Amazon echo? I had the Amazon,
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:56.000]   but I got rid of it because the problem with the Amazon one, it only has 700 watts. It's tiny.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:01.360]   It's a dinky little crappy microwave. So, I bought the Toshiba one, which has 1200 watts,
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:07.200]   but the echo and the Google Home interface don't work. I post it, and I call them up.
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:13.360]   Yeah, no, we have a bug and we haven't fixed it yet. I bought two clocks that you could pair
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:18.880]   with Amazon. One paired, one never paired. By the time I figured out it never was going to pair,
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:22.000]   it was too late to send it back. The same with my Toshiba microwave.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.360]   Yeah, it's really annoying.
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:25.440]   Fortunately, good microwave.
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:29.360]   Your readers are smart, Nicholas. They're smart enough not to get involved in this
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:35.440]   early adopter stuff. Do you think the new readers or early adopters are no?
[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:36.480]   Because the report's not.
[01:02:36.480 --> 01:02:41.040]   Probably. I'm probably the earliest adopter person in that building to be honest.
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:44.320]   You're the only kind of as an NFT baseball or basketball.
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:46.160]   Are you saying that you were not as stupid as your employees?
[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:50.800]   Yes, we're dumb. We buy all this crap. I feel like such an idiot.
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:57.040]   But there's a great responsibility. I am an early adopter. I buy a lot of this stuff
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:01.520]   because I think it's neat basically for no other reason. I'm kind of like a beta tested for the
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:06.640]   readers. They're going to run out. That's my excuse too. I have to buy this.
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:10.240]   But I might have it. Honey, I have to buy it. It's my job. Yes.
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:15.120]   My poor wife can't figure out how to turn on the TV. She says, "You can't die because I'll never
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:18.560]   be able to launch TV again." My wife has the same problem.
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:22.800]   Yeah, too many remotes. My TV keeps crashing. It keeps rebooting. I have a TCL.
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:26.080]   I have it hooked up to a Vizio sound bar and they're not.
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:29.600]   They work together, but for some reason they crash each other all the time.
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:32.160]   And it drives my wife crazy. Why do you have to reboot the television?
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:34.240]   You should not have to reboot the appliance.
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:40.320]   It's a television. I know. It's true. I just got for my mother-in-law TCL.
[01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:45.520]   After four hours, it was turning off automatically. The sleep timer wasn't on.
[01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:50.000]   My mother had that problem with her TCL too.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:55.840]   We're cheap because they're Chinese TV's. But they have Roku built in.
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:59.280]   They are good. They're very good. They're very inexpensive.
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:01.360]   You can't tell me to buy it. He not gave it a high rating.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.920]   It's one of our highest rating TVs.
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:09.440]   Mom has two. I bought her two. She's got one for the living room, one for the bedroom.
[01:04:09.440 --> 01:04:12.000]   But her bedroom one used to turn off, then it stopped.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.880]   So maybe it'll just stop. It's a bandwidth setting apparently,
[01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:17.920]   which I just found this out today. I'm still working on this.
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:21.200]   Maybe we figured that out. Interesting.
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:26.640]   Now she's so funny because she's 88. And it's actually good.
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:30.160]   It's a good practice for me because I'll be on FaceTime with mom.
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:37.920]   I did that this on Monday. I'm setting up the Apple TV so she can watch Showtime.
[01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:45.120]   I recommend this, Nicholas. Find an older person and try to explain to them how the Apple remote
[01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:50.480]   works on the Apple TV. Impossible. Yeah.
[01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:54.240]   Mom, it's a trackpad. It's just like the trackpad on your laptop,
[01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:58.720]   but it's a little one at the top of the remote control. There's nothing at the top.
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:01.520]   No, that's the... Oh my God, the pain.
[01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:04.960]   The pain. It's not a great remote. I had an Apple TV.
[01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:09.120]   It was one of the previous generations. It was fine. The device itself was fine,
[01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:11.680]   but that remote, something to be desired.
[01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:19.600]   Yes. We are expecting an Apple event, not this Tuesday. The current consensus among
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:28.000]   people who make up Apple rumors is the 23rd. And there is a small but finite chance there
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:33.680]   will be a new Apple TV on the 23rd. And all anybody's hoping for is a decent remote control.
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:39.520]   They work once you learn how to use them, but I defy you to try to explain it
[01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:44.480]   to your mom or my 88-year-old mom. She actually figured it out.
[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:49.760]   They could double the total addressable market of that product with a better remote
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:54.640]   easily. The real problem with that product is the same problem that I had with a HomePod,
[01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:59.280]   which is $200. And Roku is $30.
[01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:03.120]   It's better in many ways.
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:10.800]   The Ultra... I still prefer the Apple TV. I have both Roku and Apple TV.
[01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:19.040]   I do still prefer it, even with the crazy remote. And there are a few good things about the remote,
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:22.480]   for sure. And we've written about that.
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:25.280]   You can talk to it. But everybody goes that now.
[01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:34.800]   But it is a challenge to do some simple things. And that sort of fails one of the primary
[01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:38.640]   tenants of consumer electronics. Hold the trackpad down. What's the trackpad? The top
[01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:44.880]   out of the top, press that down until the icon goes jiggle, jiggle, jiggle. What? Just do it.
[01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:49.680]   Press it and hold it to the icon. Okay, they're jiggling. Okay, now this is tricky.
[01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:58.400]   Let go. Let go. And then slowly move your finger up the trackpad, holding the thing,
[01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:01.680]   the jiggle, jiggle, jiggle, because I'm trying to get show time to the top of the icon,
[01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:05.200]   Ro. That was probably not a mistake. I should just have left it there.
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:10.480]   I said, "Mom, you can use the same technique to delete these, but I'll leave that for another day."
[01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:14.800]   The worst thing, if you should have been able to log into her Apple TV and do the
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:21.760]   serial again. I get a log into your Apple TV. I can do that? No, you can't. You should be able.
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:26.880]   They should make that a real feature. I log into everything else of hers, but I can't log into that.
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:38.080]   That's true. Yeah. Yeah. Apple suing a former employee for stealing lots of trade secrets. Simon
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:55.920]   Lancaster was in charge of materials. In the design team, he was a senior person at the
[01:07:55.920 --> 01:08:00.960]   Apple design team. He used his role. Apple says, "To gain access to internal meetings and
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:07.280]   documents outside the scope of his job as materials lead at Apple. Last day, November 1, 2019,
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:12.000]   he'll legitimately..." Why do they always do this? Downloaded a substantial number of
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:17.600]   confidential Apple documents on the last day, and then left and went to work for a startup.
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:27.120]   So now he's being sued. There's no really news there. I don't know why I brought that up.
[01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:30.960]   We're lucky that Trump is tech illiterate or he would have downloaded the entire federal
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:36.960]   database. They were very worried. Remember that the former president had all that information.
[01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:40.160]   He's too stupid to know how to do it. I think he couldn't figure it out.
[01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:50.800]   He said, "Hey, Baron, come here." You know the cyber. That was completely gratuitous political
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:55.440]   comment of the part of Larry Magad. Yep. I apologize. I don't work for CBS anymore.
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:09:00.080]   You can say anything you want. That's why. That's why. You actually knew that. You probably
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:04.080]   were familiar with that. It had rules about things like that. Yeah. They show up rules.
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:11.040]   I work for iHeart Media, actually Premiere Radio, which is their syndication division,
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:15.520]   the former syndicator of Rush Limbaugh. So pretty much, there's nothing. No rules.
[01:09:15.520 --> 01:09:20.960]   I could say anything I want. It's so funny. People will send letters.
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:25.440]   Did you hear what that guy Leo said? And my boss at Premiere goes,
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:34.320]   "Yes, sure. Whatever. Sometimes she'll send them along to me. You won't believe what we
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:40.480]   emailing got about you this time. I'm doing a tech show. I don't get political. I don't
[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:47.840]   say anything. It's very minor. Minor minor stuff. Google. I'm still wondering what I'm
[01:09:47.840 --> 01:09:54.720]   like so curious now what Nicholas got from the NBA on his NFT. Open it. I can't believe it.
[01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:58.880]   Maybe in the background I can open it. Let's do an unboxing. Did you get a box?
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:04.960]   I guess a digital box. Let me. How can you do an unboxing of a digital box?
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:09.200]   I don't know if I could show it on my screen. I can't share my screen. I probably could.
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:12.640]   Yeah, you're on Zoom. You can share your screen with us. You got to make him the
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:20.080]   presenter on the Zoom thing, I think, John. I'm waiting for the day now when somebody does
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:24.480]   like a crazy dunk and the kids are asking each other. Is that dunk on the blockchain yet?
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:26.480]   [laughter]
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:29.520]   They've sold, like I said, $200 million in highlights.
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:35.360]   NBATopshot.com. You just did it for research, I'm sure, Nicholas, right?
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:40.640]   I have a friend who is mega into it. He's spending hundreds of dollars. He's one of the
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:44.160]   speculators. I was like, "Oh, I had been reading about it."
[01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:49.280]   So this is what you bought. You bought a pack. It's just it is. It's just like a baseball cards.
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:57.280]   And so, rising, which ones did you get? I pre-ordered just the base pack.
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:02.240]   That's the other thing is that they released these things in tranches. It's like, if you want
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:07.120]   the fancy, fancy pack, well, you have to wait in line. They're all sold out.
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:11.040]   They're all sold out. Yeah. Look at that. It's very interesting how they
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:14.880]   kind of went forever. They're so smart. Yeah, they're sold out forever.
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:20.400]   They're so smart because they sold way more than what they expected.
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:26.400]   Wow. They were super smart. Okay, just a little tip. They look a little bit like condom
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:29.840]   wrappers. You might want to change the size of that, make it look more like baseball cards.
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:34.480]   Other than that, oh, I see I would go for this one. Deck the hoops.
[01:11:34.480 --> 01:11:39.600]   230 bucks sold out. So you just bought a base set. Did you get this?
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:41.680]   You don't actually get anything physical in the mail. Do you?
[01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:45.920]   No, you don't get this package or anything. That's what's hysterical about this.
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:47.600]   They make it look like you're going to get something.
[01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:51.440]   You get a link, you get an email. What do you get?
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:56.800]   No, you get, and it's funny too, because they make you wait in a queue. A couple of weeks
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:01.840]   ago, I was in line with 150,000 other people trying to buy one of these packs.
[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:05.280]   That's smart. You want to create this false sense of urgency and this scarcity.
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:08.880]   Oh, yep. And the folks in the discord are freaking out. They're like, "Oh, my God.
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:11.680]   There's a hundred thousand people ahead of me. There's no way I'm getting it." And you're waiting
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:15.200]   in this queue for hours. And you're just kind of like getting it.
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:19.280]   And with both of them, it's a little suggested because of the joy it took even longer for it
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:23.040]   to get to you, right? Oh, yeah. You didn't have to mail it. They don't mail it.
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:26.960]   Yeah, mail it. I don't know if I could open it live. I don't know.
[01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:32.000]   You don't have to. That's all right. I just thought it'd be good for our YouTube numbers
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:36.000]   if you did it on Fox. Well, that's actually funny to bring that up, because that is like a
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:42.000]   burgeoning piece of content, like people opening packs live and they have like hype videos.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:47.120]   And it's actually quite clever, I guess. If I were smart, I would have promoted this.
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:52.480]   I would have said, "Next week, Nicholas De Leon is coming on. He's going to open his pack.
[01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:57.040]   This is huge. I would have done four or five videos all week long building this up."
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:00.160]   See, I'm not good at this stuff. He could have been the Geraldo of Rivera.
[01:13:01.600 --> 01:13:06.800]   You're talking about Al Capone safe? Yeah, which ended up having what? Nothing in it. It was like
[01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:12.080]   dust. Nothing in it. Nothing. Wow. That's always a risk. I can save it for next time. I won't open
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:16.640]   it. Maybe we'll coordinate and I can open it live. Well, I would understand. I don't know. Maybe
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:20.880]   there'll be something in there that I don't think there would be that would give away your
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:25.760]   credit card number or something. I don't think it's just what it shifts. What happens to the
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:32.480]   $10,000 for it between now and the next show? I find that unlikely because it's a standard pack
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:35.760]   or it's a base pack, whatever they call it. But only 5,000 other people have it.
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:42.480]   Yeah. Probably not the best gifs in this one, if I had to guess. But we'll see.
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:47.520]   Just so that we can prepare for this next time, give me the shock look that you do on YouTube,
[01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:53.360]   Nicholas. So like, "Oh my God, I just opened it. It's amazing. Give me that look. Come on. You
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:57.680]   could do it." Oh my God. No, no, come on. But yeah, there you go. There you go. Stick out your tongue.
[01:13:57.680 --> 01:14:01.680]   That's it. And then I get that. And I run around.
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:07.360]   Yeah. We've got over. Yeah, we've got it. There's your... That's your... That's the thumbnail.
[01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:15.680]   That's the thumbnail right now. You know, Leo, you should make an NFT out of the first episode of
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:22.240]   Twitch. I have them. So I guarantee you, somebody would buy that. Would you buy it?
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:27.280]   I might actually buy that. I remember where I was sitting where you guys recorded the first
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:30.880]   twin actually. But what would that mean? You heard the copyright. Would that mean that the
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:34.560]   person who bought it would own the copyright or just... Well, we don't copyright it. They're creative
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:40.560]   parallons. They're creative comments. We don't do anything. It would basically be me signing it
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:47.360]   digitally, authenticating that this is the first episode of Twitch. I'm giving it to you.
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:55.200]   I'm giving it to you. The first edition. So they own the one of a kind digital copy or the digital
[01:14:55.200 --> 01:15:00.000]   original essentially of it. And then all other versions are copies of it, right?
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:03.600]   Except I don't know if I could do that because I don't really know if I have the original.
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:07.600]   Well, it doesn't... It doesn't... Well, that's the thing. It becomes the original.
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:12.400]   The original tweet. You designate your original one. No, there is. Where is it? So John has gone
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:19.600]   through our old hard drives. And he has this concept. John, I think wants us to make money.
[01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:28.480]   Big mistake there, John. So he's given me a list. These are pre-show clips from 2008.
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:35.520]   Me and Paul Therat pre-show Windows Weekly. Me and Megan Maroney pre-show jumping monkeys.
[01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:40.480]   A live stream we did on building the Ultimate Game Machine with Colleen Henry and Ryan Shrout.
[01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:47.360]   Security now pre-show. These are all from 2008, from August 2008. And that Daily Gizf is
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:54.960]   from 2008. It's on here. So these are now... Those are the originals. I just blessed them.
[01:15:54.960 --> 01:16:00.800]   So then what do I do? I don't know. I need to met a co-vamp.
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:07.840]   To tokenize them. Leo, I bet if you sold the first episode of
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:16.080]   Twit as an NFT and took the proceeds and put it in Bitcoin and held it for $10,
[01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:21.520]   I bet you that would be worth a million dollars. I would lose my password. And you know, I have
[01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:26.160]   eight Bitcoin in a wallet. You don't have to. I have eight Bitcoin right now in a wallet that I
[01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:29.680]   can't get into because I don't remember the password. What's that worth? That you got from
[01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:37.440]   like Mt. Gox back when it was no. When Bitcoin first started, I downloaded a Bitcoin core like
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:42.640]   the software that the Bitcoin Foundation had. And I created a wallet. And at some point I was
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:47.600]   smart enough and dumb enough to password protect it, but not record the password.
[01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:55.280]   So you've got it in cold storage and... I have the wallet.def. And then we put up a QR code with
[01:16:55.840 --> 01:17:01.280]   the account on the website as part of our tip jar. Because for a while, I think we still have a
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:06.320]   tip jar. I just know and know where it is. And people gave me a tenth of a Bitcoin or whatever.
[01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:11.920]   And it ended up being 7.85 Bitcoin. I know because I can see the wallet. And I know how much is in it.
[01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:16.720]   I know all the transactions, but I just can't unlock it. So what is that worth? That's $480,000
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:22.560]   right now. Wow. Yeah, that's right. It's amazing. I'm an idiot. Will you ever be able to
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:28.560]   recover that value? Yeah. My feeling is, if I had been able to unlock it at any time in the last
[01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:34.480]   five years, I would have sold it. Right. When Bitcoin was $100, I would have sold it. So all I've
[01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:40.800]   done is gain value. I figure not being able to sell it is the best thing that ever happened to me.
[01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:46.400]   If you were applying for a loan, could you use that on your financial statement as part of your
[01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:55.040]   network? You can't access it. So I'm figuring here's my plan. This is my long range plan.
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:59.920]   Some day, quantum computers are going to happen. And there'll be a computer fast enough to crack
[01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:04.320]   this wallet. To crack that password. By then, you're probably right. Yeah, by then it'll be worth
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:12.720]   millions. You're right. Maybe worth 100 million. So Bitcoin is designed to go to a million a coin,
[01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:19.440]   right? Because it's designed to be at that level of scale. There's no limit to what it could be.
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:26.160]   I don't know. Because you can do fractional coins at any infinitesimal fraction. If it's
[01:18:26.160 --> 01:18:30.320]   worth a million, you can give somebody a million of a Bitcoin. Absolutely. You can do it right now.
[01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:39.040]   So yeah. Meanwhile, I'm waiting to see what the IRS says. Is this income?
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:44.000]   Long-term capital gains. What the hell is it?
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:50.240]   But only when startups are startups, they're starting stuff. They're trying to help folks
[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:55.840]   figure out their Bitcoin tax situation because my sense, same thing with all the GameStop stuff.
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:19:02.320]   A lot of folks who are not experienced traders or have not really dealt with this stuff are just
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:07.200]   selling and not setting aside taxes. So I do wonder that was actually a story idea I wanted to do
[01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:13.520]   for CR. What are your tax liabilities if you've sold the coin? If you translated it into some
[01:19:13.520 --> 01:19:20.240]   other coin, I just don't think people know that that is the case. Yeah. And all these exchanges,
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:24.720]   whether it's Gemini, whether it's Coinbase, all the US regulated ones, they will send you
[01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:30.880]   the tax forms come tax time. And they say, "Hey, there you go. Here's the info. You owe what you owe.
[01:19:30.880 --> 01:19:34.240]   Good luck. I don't know if folks are thinking about that." I don't even know how the IRS
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:40.400]   audits it. I mean, it's not like this is secret. If the IRS has your account number, they know what
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:45.280]   you've got. The only thing keeping it private is the fact that your account number is not widely
[01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:49.920]   disseminated, although mine was because we put it on the tip chart and there's a QR. I know.
[01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:54.720]   I just did my taxes literally last week, and they do ask you, do you own cryptocurrencies?
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:59.600]   And my understanding is that they just want you to say, "Yes or no, it's not like they're going
[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:04.160]   to come after you and look into Nicholas's deliones. It's not like I'm like a cryptocurrency man."
[01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:08.160]   They might. If they ever audited you, they might, right?
[01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:12.320]   I assume the company that are holding it are issuing 1099, which is how the IRS would know.
[01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:15.600]   Yes. So you're on the hook. They're going to catch it.
[01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:19.680]   If you do anything that is a taxable event, if you just have Bitcoin in there and it's just sitting
[01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:25.280]   there, a brewing value or losing value, as the case may be, there's no taxable event there.
[01:20:25.280 --> 01:20:29.200]   But the minute you sell it, boom, there you go. Now you better 1099.
[01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:38.160]   This is all fascinating. And I just honestly, I've come up with a rationalization
[01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:42.160]   for why I can't get to the half million dollars. I have it a Bitcoin wallet,
[01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:46.160]   and I'm going to leave it at that. I'm just waiting till it's worth 10 million, and then I'll crack it,
[01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:48.400]   right? I'll buy myself. It's the best thing that ever happened to you.
[01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:52.000]   It's the best thing that ever happened. It's the best thing. Steve, is caught.
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:56.080]   Right? Am I wrong? Yeah. Because I wouldn't have-- No, you're exactly right.
[01:20:56.080 --> 01:21:01.520]   Now Steve Gibson is a little bit of a different story. He went to Bitcoin first started. He
[01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:05.920]   created a Bitcoin miner because he was curious. And the next morning he gets up, there's 50 Bitcoin
[01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:12.320]   kind of chunk came out of a miner. He has erased the hard drive. He's lost it forever. He can't
[01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:17.120]   recover it. So there's no-- for him, there's no-- he just doesn't want to even think about it.
[01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:22.400]   That's four million dollars or something. What is it now? Two point four million.
[01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:29.760]   Yeah. I wonder how many-- given your audience, Leo, all this kind of Bitcoin stuff started--
[01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:34.640]   it was 10 years ago. If you were reading Slashdod, if you were reading Dig, any of these kind of
[01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:40.560]   mainstream nerd tech sites like I was, you would have heard about Bitcoin. You may have been a gamer,
[01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:45.520]   you may have been mining. I wonder how many people out there in Radio Land have lost a password,
[01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:51.600]   have a hard drive of crashed, or who have been smart and have fell onto it, and now are sitting
[01:21:51.600 --> 01:21:55.920]   on a beach in Hawaii or something. But I bet your audience has some pretty interesting stories.
[01:21:55.920 --> 01:22:01.920]   Yeah. I mean, there are definitely Bitcoin millionaires and even billionaires out there.
[01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:06.560]   But there's also-- I can't remember the number-- but hundreds of millions of dollars of Bitcoin
[01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:12.400]   that will be lost forever because people like me forgot the wallet or erased the hard drive or
[01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:17.360]   it's a fascinating thing. Some of the early ones got their mountain gocks
[01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:26.400]   or got ripped off. Yeah. I could have been smart enough to put my money in Mount Gocks and then
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:34.480]   have lost it all. So whatever. Our show today brought to you by podium. Do you know about
[01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:39.680]   podium podium is so cool. You might have even used podium and not know it. You go to the dentist
[01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:45.200]   or you go to the local bagel store and as you're leaving, you get a text message saying,
[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:49.840]   "Thanks for visiting. Leave us a review." That's probably podium.
[01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:55.840]   podium gives your business, especially small businesses, local businesses, the messaging tools
[01:22:55.840 --> 01:23:04.480]   to turn your website into a thriving storefront. It is so cool, especially nowadays where
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:10.720]   you're not going into a restaurant, you're good to and take out. You're not-- if you
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:16.320]   visit the dentist, it's a quick visit, you're running, come and go. But with podium, those local
[01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:23.680]   places can close the deal. They can make it easy to get paid, contact free via SMS, via text messages.
[01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:28.480]   With podium reviews, you can easily text customers to leave an online review,
[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:32.880]   improving search ratings. You know what's interesting about text messages. Unlike email,
[01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:39.680]   about 20% of emails get open. So if you're using email to do this, you're only getting to one in five.
[01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:47.520]   98% of text messages get opened. 98%. And the thing is, if you send somebody a coupon or you send them
[01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:53.760]   a invitation to come back, they're going to see that and they're going to welcome your text messages.
[01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:58.320]   podium also offers web chat. You can put that on your website so visitors can text with your team.
[01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:02.640]   And your team will like it because those text messages on the website turn into text messages on
[01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:07.200]   their phone, makes it easy for them to respond to it. You can meet with customers using podiums,
[01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:13.200]   video chat anywhere, anytime get paid faster over text with podium payments. And then, of course,
[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:18.480]   for you at the end, podium inbox brings it all together, keeps leads warm response to feedback.
[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:25.760]   It's a great way to do customer feedback. Your business can easily set up podium. It takes a day
[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:30.880]   or less. podiums got a full team in place to answer any questions to walk you through the whole thing.
[01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:38.160]   I think this is any small business these days. It's a tough environment. podium is here to help
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:43.120]   you encourage people to shop local, to communicate with your customers, communicate with your teammates
[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:48.480]   without leaving home. It's a great way for small businesses to stay connected with their customers
[01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:55.520]   safely without the face to face. podium is everything you need. And look at some of the people who use
[01:24:55.520 --> 01:25:00.960]   podium. I mentioned a dentistry. My local dentist uses it, but so does the South Tampa family and
[01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:07.280]   cosmetic dentistry. They did exactly what my dentist did as customers are leaving.
[01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:13.840]   They asked, Oh, don't forget to review us. They collected 1200 reviews averaging 4.9 stars.
[01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:18.240]   Dr. Wyatt there said the number of walk-ins is a result of our reviews as skyrocketed
[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:23.680]   before we might be seeing maybe 50 to 100 new patients a month. Now we're seeing closer to 200.
[01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:31.600]   The bridal collection uses podium. Small store, Lynn, the owner said, we don't have to take credit
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:36.240]   cards into the store. We could do it completely remotely. podium has been a godsend for us in
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:44.560]   this journey. They've processed over $200,000 in no contact payments. It's amazing. America's
[01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:50.640]   car mart used podium to collect 20 with 1000 leads through their web chat. TJ who's in charge of the
[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:54.960]   digital experience at America's car mart said before podium, we had to contact us for them.
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:59.360]   Remember those little animated mailbox? It could have been days before anybody got back to that
[01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:05.120]   customer because it's text messages. Now it's easy. Our response time is cut down to minutes. I hope
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:10.080]   I've convinced you this is a great platform for local businesses for small businesses, even for
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:15.120]   big large businesses. podium can help you reach more customers interact with them better, make more

[01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:56.000]   in podium, podium.com/twit. Thank you, podium for support. EFF article kind of got my attention.
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.960]   Remember last week or two weeks ago on Twitch, we talked about the fact that Google has announced
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:05.760]   they're no longer going to use third party cookies starting next year, nor are they going to invest
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:12.800]   in ad tech or tracking technologies. They know people don't want tracking. So what are they going
[01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:17.520]   to do instead? Well, they've introduced something with probably the worst name ever. The federated
[01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:28.320]   learning of cohorts or flock. The EFF says Google's flock is a terrible idea. No one should mourn the
[01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:32.240]   death of the cookie. They write, as we know it, for more than two decades, third party cookie has
[01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:38.320]   been the linchpin in a shadowy, seedy, multi-billion dollar advertising surveillance industry on the
[01:27:38.320 --> 01:27:43.440]   web. As I mentioned before, my friend, Corey Doctorow says, "Add blockers or cookie blockers
[01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:48.320]   is the largest consumer boycott in history. So many people are using them now that they don't
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:53.440]   work anymore. So no wonder people like Google are saying, "Well, we didn't like those in the first
[01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:58.240]   place." Google's leading the charge EFF writes to replace third party cookies with the new suite
[01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:02.160]   of technologies to target ads on the web. Notice they're not giving up ad targeting.
[01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:07.440]   Some of their proposals show it hasn't learned the right lesson from the ongoing backlash
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:12.960]   to the surveillance business model. It's a long article. I'm not going to summarize the whole thing,
[01:28:12.960 --> 01:28:21.280]   but the idea behind flock is instead of individual information about you, Google's going to create a
[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:27.680]   cohort, a segment that you belong to, and tell advertisers what Facebook does. Facebook never
[01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:33.280]   gave your information to advertisers. It's just said, "We know men between the age of 25 and 54
[01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:38.640]   who live in Northern California who spend more than $20,000 a year on lottery tickets. Would you
[01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:42.640]   like to advertise to them?" That's the kind of information you got from Facebook, and that's what
[01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:51.920]   Google plans to do with flock. But there are some issues, I think, with all of this.
[01:28:54.560 --> 01:29:02.160]   Do you credit Google Larry was doing the right thing, or is this just hand waving in the face of a
[01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:07.760]   big consumer boycott against cookies? I think it's doing what benefits Google,
[01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:16.240]   and perhaps harms its lesser endowed competitors. It may be a good thing anyway. I mean, as they
[01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:22.160]   say, I don't mourn the death of the cookie, but I think it is Google figuring out a way to continue
[01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:28.720]   business as usual using a different strategy. At the end, they're going to make plenty of money
[01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:32.640]   from it. Yeah. You agree, Nicholas?
[01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:40.720]   It's funny, at CR, we've definitely done stories on how to effectively use an ad blocker.
[01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:45.280]   It's from a currency. In a good position, a consumer of words, you don't have ads.
[01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:50.880]   My friends and colleagues work at Ad Supportive website. I can't tell, folks,
[01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:55.760]   I just put an ad blocker and destroy careers. I should buy the next thing to do.
[01:29:55.760 --> 01:30:00.080]   Google has a sponsor of Connect Safely. We don't take ads, but we do have corporate sponsors,
[01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:03.840]   and they're one of them. We've had Google ads on our shows as well.
[01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:08.560]   Now we talked bad about them. But it is not
[01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:12.080]   protecting you against editorial condemnation.
[01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:16.080]   Go ahead. I'm sorry, Nicholas.
[01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:19.920]   No, it is something that's sort of top of mind of our readers, privacy and being online,
[01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:24.320]   and having the weird ad track you. We get questions all the time. It's like,
[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:28.080]   what is happening? How do I stop this? Some people don't care to be fair.
[01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:32.800]   I think I'm going to go out and limb. I think most people don't care. In fact,
[01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:36.560]   I keep wondering, what are we really worried about?
[01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:43.040]   Wouldn't you prefer an ad for something that you're interested in, than an ad for something
[01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:47.040]   that's just wasting your energy? Because you never would want that anyway.
[01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:51.440]   Interesting. When I was younger, I was way more militant about this type of thing,
[01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:54.480]   to be honest. As I've gotten older, I just turned 35 to give you an idea.
[01:30:54.480 --> 01:31:02.320]   I sort of agree. My interests are tech stuff and video games are like soccer.
[01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:08.000]   Unless you're advertising something in those three buckets, you're just wasting your money to
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:09.760]   be honest. I'm not going to buy your thing.
[01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:11.760]   Advertisers don't want to advertise to you.
[01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:16.080]   Yeah. That saves me time, and it saves them ad budgets. I guess the question is,
[01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:20.560]   where does that line? Is it better that they know me specifically my IP address?
[01:31:20.560 --> 01:31:24.800]   Is it better that they go even further and try to fingerprint my machine? That's kind of weird.
[01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:29.280]   Or do they just put me in a cohort or whatever they want to call it?
[01:31:29.280 --> 01:31:36.960]   Here is a mid 30s guy who likes nerd junk. Let's show him some ads for GPUs or mice and keyboards.
[01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:39.840]   That feels okay, I guess, to me.
[01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:44.480]   I understand why people run ad blockers. There are a lot of other good reasons. Ads
[01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:47.520]   take up a huge amount of bandwidth. They slow the page down ridiculously.
[01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:53.280]   They can bring malware into your system. There's lots of good reasons to not want that kind of
[01:31:53.280 --> 01:32:00.480]   advertising. To me, especially this cohort tracking, the kind that Facebook and Google do,
[01:32:00.480 --> 01:32:07.600]   the only risk, as far as I'm concerned, I stopped using Instagram because their ads were so damn
[01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:15.120]   good that I kept buying stuff. They were too good. Instagram, of all of the platform,
[01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:19.840]   seems to know best exactly what's going to get me to buy something in the middle of the night
[01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:24.320]   when I'm doom scrolling every single time. I got rid of Instagram, not because I don't love it.
[01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:27.120]   I love it, but because I stopped I was buying too much crap.
[01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:28.240]   Costing you too much money?
[01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:30.320]   It was cost to me. It was too good.
[01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:38.080]   They do get, I think the last time I looked, I think they get three to four X the click
[01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:41.280]   throughs on ads. Is it the best? Is it the most effective?
[01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:46.480]   I believe it is, at scale, I believe it has the highest click rates.
[01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:53.360]   I work for, obviously, work for ad supported media, but CNET, we do consider ourselves consumer
[01:32:53.360 --> 01:33:01.120]   advocates and as consumer advocates. We certainly welcome the end of third party cookies. They've
[01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:11.040]   over reached over the past decade especially. But the idea of cohorts to the points that you
[01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:18.080]   all have made, there is some good on the other side of that to the Instagram example.
[01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:24.560]   It does let them target things to you better and provide you useful stuff.
[01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:32.960]   The challenge is you may end up finding too many things to buy. That's a whole different issue.
[01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:40.960]   But all in all, I think we have to assume that over time, that AI, deep learning,
[01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:46.160]   all of these things are going to get better and the targeting is going to get really good and
[01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:52.160]   effective even without third party cookies. Remember, you're still going to have first party cookies.
[01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:57.520]   So those sites cooking you for the stuff on their site, they're still going to track what you look
[01:33:57.520 --> 01:34:02.400]   at and do on their site. They're going to know your IP address. They're going to have data on you.
[01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:08.800]   These things are going to still get better over time. But what you're removing is the really
[01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:15.760]   egregious stuff that these third party tracking things were doing. Some of these ads that were
[01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:21.840]   following... I don't want Cambridge Analytica to put political ads in my Facebook feed because
[01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:28.720]   they've done sentiment analysis and have decided that's not good. Although, I guess it's another
[01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:37.200]   form of ad tracking. I feel like also readers of consumer reports might use the word creepy to
[01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:42.160]   describe this. I think that that's what people who don't like technology or don't understand what's
[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:47.120]   going on with technology always say, "Oh, that's creepy." If they really understood it, they might
[01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:53.120]   not think it's creepy. It's the thing too. It's like, "Oh, my phone is listening to me." I'm just
[01:34:53.120 --> 01:34:57.520]   talking about an app or service. I won't mention the name here. But like a conversation, "What's app
[01:34:57.520 --> 01:35:02.320]   which I know isn't encrypted?" We were talking about this app and then lo and behold, later that
[01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:07.360]   evening, I got an ad. I think it was in YouTube, if I'm not mistaken. So it's like, I know that
[01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:12.480]   that's actually not what's happening here. But it's just... There's all this doubt about what it's
[01:35:12.480 --> 01:35:19.280]   so opaque and no one... Unless you're deep into ad tech every day, it is very, very hard to understand.
[01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:24.400]   One of the things I really appreciate about being at consumer reports is really understanding
[01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:29.120]   and empathizing with folks. People have lives. They have kids. They have jobs. They have things to
[01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:35.280]   do. They don't spend all day on tech, Twitter, or refreshing tech meme or whatever. They're living
[01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:40.800]   a life. So if they don't really understand how this ad stuff works, yeah, maybe they'll use words
[01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:45.840]   creepy, but it's just like opaque and like... There's a huge opportunity for you, though,
[01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:51.600]   to talk to real people and explain what's going on. I mean, it's also a responsibility. It's a burden.
[01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:54.640]   No, I agree. I agree. Yeah, but I think that's a great opportunity for you.
[01:35:54.640 --> 01:35:58.960]   I've long since accepted the fact that if I go shopping for something, I'm going to get inundated
[01:35:58.960 --> 01:36:03.200]   with ads for that product. But what bugs me is after I bought it. Do you think they'd be smart
[01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:07.120]   enough to know? That's just bad. Yeah, that's just the market for it. That's just a bad algorithm.
[01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:12.800]   That's not creepy or intrusive. It's just stupid because the algorithm is broken. But you see that
[01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:17.040]   all the time you go to Amazon and they say, "People like you often buy this. Yeah, I bought it yesterday.
[01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:23.600]   That's why you say that." Although, Nicholas, if you start getting ads for, I don't know, NBA
[01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:29.200]   highlights in your feed, it wouldn't be surprising or creepy. It would just make sense.
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:34.480]   Yeah, well, I agree. But one of my editors makes a very similar argument. A year or two ago,
[01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:40.320]   he was in the market for a car, I think about Honda or something. He still gets ads after the
[01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:47.440]   purchase was finished. He's still getting ads for Toyota and Mazda. This doesn't make any sense.
[01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:51.840]   This is just wasting them. I've already bought the car. So the complaint, in that case, is not
[01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:56.240]   against tracking. It's about a just poorly implemented algorithm. Well, if the tracking
[01:36:56.240 --> 01:37:01.440]   isn't good enough, they know you were looking for the car. They didn't know you bought it.
[01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:05.680]   So in some ways, it's good. Maybe it would be worse if they knew that you had bought the Honda.
[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:10.800]   So track me better. Nobody says that. Nobody says he's tracking better.
[01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:16.880]   Are you supposed to say, "Oh, well, they're not tracking me enough then." Here you go.
[01:37:16.880 --> 01:37:22.560]   Yeah, do a better job. There should be a button where you say, "I bought it already.
[01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:29.200]   I already bought it." Right. Which actually would be very valuable data itself.
[01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:33.760]   Oh, hugely valuable. Are you kidding? That would trigger a whole cascade of advertisements.
[01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:41.760]   Do you have the formats? Yeah. Google's a little bit in trouble. Judge Lucy Ko, who's
[01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:48.800]   been involved because she's a federal judge in the Silicon District, includes the Silicon Valley
[01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:56.480]   in Northern California District, yelled at Google saying, "I can't believe incognito mode doesn't
[01:37:56.480 --> 01:38:04.240]   hide anything from Google." She has approved a class action lawsuit from consumers who complain
[01:38:04.240 --> 01:38:09.440]   that even when they turn off data collection in Chrome, other Google tools used by websites
[01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:15.600]   end up amassing their personal information. Judge Ko wrote, "The court concludes, Google did not
[01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:21.520]   notify users that Google engages in the alleged data collection while the user is in private
[01:38:21.520 --> 01:38:27.360]   browsing mode. Private implies private." Google says, "We strongly dispute these claims,
[01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:35.600]   and we will defend ourselves vigorously against them." Incognito mode in Chrome gives you the choice
[01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:39.280]   to browse the internet without your activity being saved to your browser and device,
[01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:45.760]   your in effect being incognito from yourself. As we clearly state each time you open a new incognito
[01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:50.000]   tab, websites might be able to collect information about your browsing activity during your session.
[01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:59.920]   I talk to people all the time. Like you, Nicholas, I also talk to the unwashed
[01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:06.880]   masses, normal people. Regular folks who listen to the radio show. They must have some interest in
[01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:12.160]   technology. They wouldn't listen to a technology radio show. But they are always amazed when I say,
[01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:18.320]   "Oh, yeah, incognito mode doesn't hide anything from Google. It just hides it from your spouse,
[01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:22.640]   basically." That's who it's like. No, I agree. We really ran. I wrote the story maybe a year,
[01:39:22.640 --> 01:39:27.920]   though maybe two years ago, I forget now, "What does incognito mode do?" And the takeaways,
[01:39:27.920 --> 01:39:34.800]   it is local. So your roommate doesn't see which websites are. That is basically it.
[01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:40.000]   Websites can still track you or there's a possibility of them still track. And folks don't know that.
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:44.800]   They see incognito mode. They see the little guy with the disguise and the glasses.
[01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:49.120]   And they assume that they're tracking as if they were using Tor or something.
[01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:51.280]   And that's not very white, what incognito mode means.
[01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:56.000]   Incognito. But by the way, it ain't just Google. Safari has private browsing,
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:03.280]   not private. Firefox, Edge, they all do it. I guess this is an example of engineers understand
[01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:08.880]   what it means. That's what it feels like to me. Yeah. I think it keeps your spouse from knowing
[01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:13.360]   that you've been to a porn site. I think that's it's most... Okay, you said it. I wasn't going to say it.
[01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:16.640]   Well, you're letting that secret out. You think I'll be for you again?
[01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:19.120]   The secret is out. Honey, I'm sorry.
[01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:27.440]   All right, let's see. Let me take another break. We have a lot more to cover, but we don't have a
[01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:31.280]   lot more time. I don't want to pour nicholas. We have to... Well, if you've listened to the show,
[01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:36.000]   you know it goes on and on and on and on. I'm here. Let's go. And on and on and on.
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:39.840]   I figure Larry and Jason are already aware of that.
[01:40:40.320 --> 01:40:47.280]   Well, I will... We actually... We had a fun week. We did a great promo. We've made this for you.
[01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:51.200]   I'm going to make you watch it and then we'll have more on Twitch. Watch.
[01:40:51.200 --> 01:41:00.000]   Oh my God. We match. No way. Holy moly. She's wearing a hotdog hat.
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:04.080]   Folks who are tuning in. He's wearing a mustard previously on Twitch.
[01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:11.120]   Tech News Weekly. We have Eugene Kim from Business Insider here to talk about his piece
[01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:19.760]   on Amazon's Vesta Home Robot. It's kind of this home personal assistant. The most common
[01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:26.720]   description I've heard is that it's basically a fire tablet, you know, Echo Show device mounted
[01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:32.640]   on wheels. This week in Google. Oh God. We brought Ray on and of course,
[01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:36.400]   Tracy's an old friend because you sent me an email the other day. He said, "Here's an NFT of
[01:41:36.400 --> 01:41:40.720]   one of my images. We have been trying Trey for a month to figure out what the hell these
[01:41:40.720 --> 01:41:46.800]   non-fungible tokens are." The wave of interest is so high that it's probably the right time you get
[01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:55.600]   in. Security now. To make it easier to watch YouTube videos, the creative agency Happiness
[01:41:55.600 --> 01:42:04.880]   Saigon partnered with Frito-Lay to create the Lays Krispy subtitles browser extension
[01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:10.080]   that automatically enables YouTube captions when it detects you are eating chips.
[01:42:10.080 --> 01:42:16.160]   This is why we have computer technologies. This was what it was all meant to do.
[01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:27.120]   Oh Lord. Thank you, Steve Gibson for discovering the Lays Krispy subtitle Chrome extension.
[01:42:27.120 --> 01:42:33.040]   Our show today brought to you by ExtraHop, the SolarWinds Sunburst Attack Man. What a wake-up call
[01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:39.040]   in the changing threat landscape. And I'll even add now the exchange server zero days. Holy cow.
[01:42:39.040 --> 01:42:45.200]   Cyber attacks have only become more advanced, harder to detect. And the problem, the problem,
[01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:50.320]   all these people who run exchange servers are facing right now, or we're hacked in the SolarWinds
[01:42:50.320 --> 01:42:57.120]   attack, is is there somebody in my network? Were they able to use those attacks to live in my network?
[01:42:57.120 --> 01:43:03.760]   When cyber criminals get past your defenses, businesses need a plan for detection and response.
[01:43:03.760 --> 01:43:09.920]   And I think we all understand now that that whole model of protection and prevention alone is no
[01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:15.120]   longer enough. That's why you need ExtraHop. And especially ExtraHop Reveal X. It's the only solution
[01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:21.440]   that shows not just where intruders are going, but where they've been. Intruders love to cover
[01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:26.080]   their tracks with Reveal X they can't. You can investigate incidents and prevent them from turning
[01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:33.120]   into full blown breaches. Would cyber attacks make the news? First question I ask are a security
[01:43:33.120 --> 01:43:38.400]   team? In other words, are IT guy? First question security teams need to know. First question you
[01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:43.600]   must be asking if you're running exchange server. Have we been compromised? That's why Reveal X
[01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:48.800]   is so great. Get 90 days of record look back, complete network visibility across the data center,
[01:43:48.800 --> 01:43:54.080]   the cloud, the device edge. So security teams can actually do an audit. They can actually get
[01:43:54.080 --> 01:44:00.480]   real answers and they can get it fast. Because let's face it, response time is critical.
[01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:06.080]   In a post-compromised world, your greatest chance of stopping advanced threats is with ExtraHop's
[01:44:06.080 --> 01:44:13.600]   network detection and response. Respond fast. You'll limit the damage. Respond slow.
[01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:19.840]   Sky's the limit. Learn more about how ExtraHop stops breaches 84% faster. They've got a great
[01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:30.080]   interactive demo. You can try at extrahop.com/twit. Extrahop.com/twit. Something you absolutely
[01:44:30.800 --> 01:44:38.160]   need. Extrahop.com/twit. We were talking about Google and their court troubles. Microsoft piling on.
[01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:46.400]   I love the little snippy back and forth between Google and Microsoft. Brad Smith
[01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:54.400]   testifying in front of Congress this week. Let me see if I can find his quotes here.
[01:44:58.400 --> 01:45:04.560]   Too many stories. Too long of a list of things to talk about.
[01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:15.440]   Remember, Microsoft with this exchange and SolarWinds thing has really been under the gun.
[01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:24.240]   So I don't have the exact quote. But Brad Smith saying, "Yeah, Google has really been killing
[01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:32.000]   journalism with its search results. It's about time journalists could come to Google and say,
[01:45:32.000 --> 01:45:36.640]   hey, we want some money for LinkText. He's talking about what happened in Australia.
[01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:40.960]   And apparently he's encouraging the United States Congress to follow the same path."
[01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:48.480]   Google's response to this is, "Microsoft's just trying to say, don't pay any attention to the
[01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:56.240]   SolarWinds exchange hacks. You really ought to be going after Google." It's really ugly. I got to
[01:45:56.240 --> 01:46:02.080]   say, it's really ugly to see these guys attacking each other. And they've both got things to work on
[01:46:02.080 --> 01:46:09.760]   in their home. No need to go to Congress and say, "Oh, yeah, we need a LinkText. That's just a bad idea."
[01:46:09.760 --> 01:46:14.320]   And I guess the real problem is I don't trust Congress for a second to do the right thing.
[01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:19.520]   They're going to, "Oh, yeah, that's a good idea. In fact, they already are considering
[01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:23.760]   doing what they did in Australia. And Google will probably have to make a deal with
[01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:30.640]   big journalism organizations." Now, you all work for, well, Larry Lesso, but Jason,
[01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:38.320]   you work for CNET and Nicholas, you work for consumer reports. Do you feel like Google is
[01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:46.720]   chasing you? Jason, let me start with you. Is stealing your traffic? Oh boy, that's a very
[01:46:46.720 --> 01:46:52.160]   philosophical question. That's the debate, isn't it? So the thing is, Google puts these snippets.
[01:46:52.160 --> 01:46:59.680]   So if Google does see, is a search index on CNET and they see the latest story on CNET,
[01:46:59.680 --> 01:47:04.080]   they'll put a little snippet in there. CNET doesn't say this. Rupert Murdoch says it.
[01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:09.120]   His contention and other published attention is, "Oh, they see this snippet. They don't need to go
[01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:14.080]   to the page." But I think on the other hand, Google points out, "Look, without us driving traffic
[01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:20.480]   to your site, no one even would know the article exists. We drive far more traffic than we pull away."
[01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:26.240]   Yeah. And the truth is, most of the time you end up in one of those featured snippet boxes,
[01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:29.920]   you're getting a ton of traffic from it. Okay, that's what I'm curious about. I mean, you know.
[01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:40.160]   You know. Yeah. That's right. So now you have to be smart about it. As you have to know that
[01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:46.720]   you're aiming this long-tailed story, add something that is evergreen at one of these
[01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:52.960]   snippet boxes. You're going to put enough information in there that's going to tease it,
[01:47:52.960 --> 01:47:59.440]   in some cases, but it's still going to show that you've got more context if they click through the
[01:47:59.440 --> 01:48:05.280]   link and they want more. So you have to understand what you're doing there.
[01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:12.560]   But yeah, and Google is, it's a fair point to say that Google is putting more and more
[01:48:12.560 --> 01:48:18.480]   of their thing, and they want more and more of it on their page because they have Facebook jealousy,
[01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:24.320]   right? Facebook has these long engagement times, and Google has much more transactional traffic.
[01:48:26.560 --> 01:48:29.920]   But Google doesn't want you to live on that search page, or do they?
[01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:34.480]   I mean, that's what these things are all about. That's what all of these things are about.
[01:48:34.480 --> 01:48:40.640]   That's why they have those little questions too, right? Where you type in, right? And you can just
[01:48:40.640 --> 01:48:46.960]   unpack those questions of like, you know, what is an NFT? Is an NFT worth as much as Bitcoin,
[01:48:46.960 --> 01:48:50.720]   whatever. It's got those little questions. You hit those questions and it expands out.
[01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:53.920]   You don't need to go to a site. You're getting all that information.
[01:48:53.920 --> 01:48:59.600]   Right. But on the other hand, I do write for the Mercury News and I write for Forbes, and I crave
[01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:04.160]   high listings on Google News. I mean, when those happen, that's money in the bank. I mean,
[01:49:04.160 --> 01:49:09.280]   that can generate enormous traffic, which can translate into enormous ad revenue if that's how
[01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:14.160]   you're monetizing. So I don't quite understand why it's such a big problem for publishers,
[01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:20.480]   you know, when they benefit from it as well. The bigger problem that it creates is not that
[01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:27.360]   they're stealing traffic. It that essentially Google used to be about that front page, right? If you
[01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:34.960]   were, if you had your link on the front page of Google, pretty much any of those like, you know,
[01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:43.280]   10 slots, you did really well. Now it's being concentrated into a smaller Google white listed
[01:49:43.280 --> 01:49:49.280]   version of the best results, and it's more winner take all. So if you end up in one of those featured
[01:49:49.280 --> 01:49:53.200]   snippets or you end up as one of the first two links or you end up in the news box, if it's a
[01:49:53.200 --> 01:50:00.400]   news article, your traffic goes to, you know, the moon. If you're on just, you know, if you're not
[01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:05.840]   in one of those sort of, we'll call like the top three, in many cases, the top one, then your
[01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:11.920]   traffic now, even on the first page of Google is drastically reduced. And so Google is essentially,
[01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:15.040]   they haven't taken away traffic from you. They just haven't given you any, right? I mean,
[01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:18.640]   have they stolen your traffic or just failed to give you more traffic?
[01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:25.280]   Right. I'm saying that's the more the risk to understand here is not that Google's stealing your
[01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:32.240]   traffic. It's just that it's making, you know, a much more winner take all game, right? That's the,
[01:50:32.240 --> 01:50:36.240]   that's the thing to worry about not. But if you end up in one of those, like I said, if you're
[01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:39.920]   featured, you end up in those featured snippets, even though they're technically like taking your
[01:50:39.920 --> 01:50:44.240]   text and put it on their page, you still get so much traffic out of it, which is, I know what
[01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:49.840]   you're getting too Larry as well, that it's more than worth it to end up in one of those.
[01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:58.560]   Right. So on balance, you would rather have Google do that than lose Google referral traffic
[01:50:58.560 --> 01:51:03.600]   entirely. Sure. Yeah. Like we're not going to block Google from taking that.
[01:51:03.600 --> 01:51:09.120]   Right. And you could, by the way, I don't know why Google doesn't say, hey, you know,
[01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:14.000]   there's this thing called robots.txt. You could keep us from indexing. You don't
[01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:17.840]   have to show up in our search results if you don't like it. Of course, if you can get both,
[01:51:17.840 --> 01:51:20.720]   if you can get the traffic and a fee from Google so much to bet.
[01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:27.360]   Maybe that has something to do with this. I was thinking of a broadcaster on cable news, a cable,
[01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:33.120]   I mean, a cable like Comcast, you're not, you're getting your ads are being seen by more people.
[01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:38.080]   And if you can get some kind of kickback from the cable company, you know, even better. So
[01:51:38.080 --> 01:51:44.160]   that may be the model that they're looking at. Yeah. Google Google called Brad Smith's testimony
[01:51:44.160 --> 01:51:46.640]   in front of Congress naked opportunism.
[01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:56.560]   Claws are out. The claws are out. I love it when the big guys fight. It's just fun to watch.
[01:51:56.560 --> 01:52:02.960]   Let's see. What else? Federal regulators, you guys own Tesla's. You sound like you have a Tesla,
[01:52:02.960 --> 01:52:07.760]   right, Jason? I do not. Oh, you don't. Okay. It just sounds like he does.
[01:52:07.760 --> 01:52:10.480]   He sounds like he does. He seemed like the kind of guy that might have one.
[01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:19.520]   I long time admirer of what they're doing and pro, you know, would likely own a Tesla,
[01:52:19.520 --> 01:52:22.960]   you know, in the future. And Larry does a self driving Tesla.
[01:52:22.960 --> 01:52:29.680]   I did have one. I now have that new Ford electric vehicle, which has many of the same features.
[01:52:29.680 --> 01:52:35.120]   The Maki. The Maki. Great. Where do you stand, Nicholas, on Teslas?
[01:52:36.960 --> 01:52:40.480]   I don't have a. I think the Cybertruck looks pretty cool. I'm not a car guy. I mean,
[01:52:40.480 --> 01:52:46.240]   I don't have any fully formed opinion. I have a Honda Civic and it drives to like the Walmart.
[01:52:46.240 --> 01:52:53.120]   I don't really. I have a Honda Civic with 100,000 miles on it. Actually, my mom's Honda Civic
[01:52:53.120 --> 01:52:58.560]   literally did have 200,000 miles on it before she stopped driving. I know that you can't kill it.
[01:52:58.560 --> 01:53:04.720]   They just can't kill it. Tesla forums, people are always coming down on consumer reports because
[01:53:04.720 --> 01:53:09.440]   you guys don't gentrifle good. Good for you that you don't know. In fact, it was a shock when
[01:53:09.440 --> 01:53:19.520]   consumer reports. I think they they they downgraded Tesla for reliability and then upgraded.
[01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:24.240]   And then, but I think there was also some criticism of the self driving features. Now,
[01:53:24.240 --> 01:53:31.520]   it's the NTSB's turn. Right. They have filed comments blasting the National Highway Traffic
[01:53:31.520 --> 01:53:38.400]   Safety Administration for a permissive regulation of driver assistance systems.
[01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:47.520]   The NTSB is the organization that investigates accidents. The National Highway Traffic Safety
[01:53:47.520 --> 01:53:54.640]   Administration, the NHTSA, sets the standard. The NTSB calls out Tesla's autopilot for its
[01:53:54.640 --> 01:54:00.960]   lax safety practices and says the NHTSA should establish some minimum standards. There are none
[01:54:01.520 --> 01:54:07.280]   and in fact, for the last four years under them, President Trump, the National Highway
[01:54:07.280 --> 01:54:12.720]   Transportation Safety Administration largely let automakers do what they liked when it came to
[01:54:12.720 --> 01:54:20.480]   advanced driver assistance systems, ADAS systems and prototype driverless vehicles. The NHTSA is
[01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:26.880]   generally weighted. This is from an article in Ars Technica, credit to Timothy B. Lee for this one.
[01:54:26.880 --> 01:54:37.760]   The NHTSA has generally waited. Oh, now I lost the paragraph until there's been a problem
[01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:46.000]   before they address it. But the NTSB singled out Tesla specifically. You may not like this,
[01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:53.040]   Larry, 16 times in the report, partly because there've been so many there've been six crashes
[01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:58.480]   involving driver's assistance in the last years. Now, four of them were fatal, but how many hundreds
[01:54:58.480 --> 01:55:04.480]   of thousands of people have died in that same time period? That's the issue. I recognize that
[01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:10.240]   full self-driving is far from perfect. There have been a couple of cases like road hazard. There
[01:55:10.240 --> 01:55:13.680]   might have been a trash can in the middle of the road. It might not have stopped had I not been
[01:55:13.680 --> 01:55:19.120]   vigilant. You really do have to watch it. But by and large, it's a better driver than I am.
[01:55:19.120 --> 01:55:23.680]   I mean, I change lanes, for example. I use the lane changing. And I still look around,
[01:55:23.680 --> 01:55:27.680]   but I actually trust it more than I trust me. It has more eyes than I do.
[01:55:27.680 --> 01:55:34.960]   Its processors are sharper than better memory. Again, I look at it as a safety feature
[01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:42.240]   as long as I'm also being vigilant. The NTSB said Tesla recently released a beta version of
[01:55:42.240 --> 01:55:46.800]   its level two autopilot system. That's the thing you were talking about. Larry described as having
[01:55:46.800 --> 01:55:53.280]   full self-driving capability by releasing the system. Tesla is testing on public roads,
[01:55:53.280 --> 01:55:58.960]   a highly automated AV technology, but with limited oversight and reporting requirements.
[01:55:58.960 --> 01:56:03.200]   They say the energy system. And using drivers who are not trained. I mean,
[01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:09.200]   when Google tests or Waymo tests its cars, I presume that the so-called safety drivers are
[01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:15.600]   trained and responsible for how they operate it. Anybody can buy a Tesla and be an idiot if they
[01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:22.400]   want to. But there is something you must mention the other day that they actually will take people
[01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:26.880]   out of the beta program if they find that you're driving you're responsible. I saw that. Do you
[01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:33.920]   get your $5,000 back? No, no, no, no, no. That's not go crazy. I'm not in the beta program. I
[01:56:33.920 --> 01:56:39.440]   haven't been anointed yet. So I just have the regular so-called full self-driving, which is pretty
[01:56:39.440 --> 01:56:44.240]   automated already. But the beta program, it actually makes left and right turns on city streets and
[01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:52.240]   does things that the shipping version doesn't do yet. I see the two competing things. The NHTSA
[01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:58.000]   wants to foster this technology. And as many jurisdictions have done, for instance, Arizona,
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:04.480]   we're going to need this. Humans are terrible drivers. So let's really make it easier for
[01:57:04.480 --> 01:57:10.880]   self-driving research to happen. Public streets, yeah, but you're not going to learn unless you go
[01:57:10.880 --> 01:57:15.920]   out in public. The NHTSP is saying people should not be dying. You need to make standards. You need
[01:57:15.920 --> 01:57:20.880]   to set some standards so that automakers can't just do whatever they want. I understand both
[01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:27.200]   points of view, really. Yeah. I mean, Tesla, they did find like there have been, you know,
[01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:32.240]   these safety organizations have done because there have been people that have died. They have
[01:57:32.240 --> 01:57:38.960]   done these investigations of Tesla autopilot. What they found is it is on a highway driving,
[01:57:40.080 --> 01:57:45.040]   right? It is safer than a human today, like the version that's out there.
[01:57:45.040 --> 01:57:56.400]   So there's that. But I think what this one is getting to is that there are no that the
[01:57:56.400 --> 01:58:04.560]   the agencies are not setting standards for these things. And so you have, for example,
[01:58:05.120 --> 01:58:11.840]   GM, which isn't in very many cars at all, right? But they have their standard, which has on the top
[01:58:11.840 --> 01:58:20.320]   of the wheel, it has a bar that checks to make sure your eyes are looking straight ahead, right?
[01:58:20.320 --> 01:58:26.400]   So it has what is essentially a stronger safety feature than what Tesla offers.
[01:58:26.400 --> 01:58:32.160]   And GM will only let you use it on mapped freeways. You can't use it off the freeway.
[01:58:32.720 --> 01:58:36.640]   And you can't use it on a freeway that haven't mapped. My Ford has a very similar system, by the
[01:58:36.640 --> 01:58:41.360]   way. It's not been turned on yet. But there is a little bar. There's a camera watching your eyes.
[01:58:41.360 --> 01:58:48.000]   I drove a Cadillac with that system, the CTS, that system in it. And it was, I was trying to test
[01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:52.240]   it to see if it would say, Hey, Leo, you know, paying attention. And I could, it was so scary
[01:58:52.240 --> 01:58:57.200]   that I didn't want to take my eyes off the road. So I went like this, I put my hands over my eyes
[01:58:57.200 --> 01:59:01.040]   and then peek through to make sure I wasn't going to hit anything. But it was good enough to
[01:59:01.040 --> 01:59:06.400]   trick the camera. And it makes the seat shake, it sounds an alarm. It really says, sit up and pay
[01:59:06.400 --> 01:59:11.840]   attention. I thought that was actually quite good. I feel much, much safer in that.
[01:59:11.840 --> 01:59:17.680]   I'm just testing a little thing where now the Tesla will stop at stop signs and light.
[01:59:17.680 --> 01:59:23.920]   And it has yet to fail. I mean, that's the key. It's the one time that it runs that light or runs
[01:59:23.920 --> 01:59:28.880]   that stop sign and you get T-boned that you really wish you had paid more attention.
[01:59:28.880 --> 01:59:32.240]   On the other hand, have I ever run a red light? Oh, that's true.
[01:59:32.240 --> 01:59:41.200]   Good point. Good point. Yeah. I think maybe Tesla made a little error calling it autopilot.
[01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:46.240]   Yes, or full self driving is even worse. Yeah. And really should emphasize, I think they do.
[01:59:46.240 --> 01:59:50.640]   I've had I was my Tesla used to scold me. It would actually get me mad. And I don't know how it
[01:59:50.640 --> 01:59:56.160]   worked because I know you leased a Tesla. Yeah, for three years. And I own my autopilot or full
[01:59:56.160 --> 02:00:01.280]   self driving. And if I were to go out and buy a new Tesla, which I'm tempted to do,
[02:00:01.280 --> 02:00:05.520]   I wouldn't get to take the software with me, unlike Microsoft Office, which I can move from
[02:00:05.520 --> 02:00:10.560]   computer to computer. And so that software stays with the car, stays with the car,
[02:00:10.560 --> 02:00:14.800]   which I think is in most absurd business. Well, does it stay with the car though? If somebody
[02:00:14.800 --> 02:00:21.200]   buys that car from you, I don't think he gets it. No, they do. If I sell it to Tesla and Tesla
[02:00:21.200 --> 02:00:26.800]   resells it, it's up to them to decide. But the point is that I'd be tempted to buy a newer Tesla,
[02:00:26.800 --> 02:00:31.840]   but there'd be an additional $10,000 charge over and above the difference in the value of my used
[02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:38.560]   version and the new hardware. Well, they are saying that starting in Q2, that they're going to offer
[02:00:38.560 --> 02:00:45.440]   it as a subscription service, right? Which probably estimated like $200 a month. And at that point,
[02:00:45.440 --> 02:00:50.640]   then you sell the car, it doesn't go with the car, and you get a new Tesla, you just keep
[02:00:51.120 --> 02:00:58.400]   paying it. That service could also be, yeah, there could be some other features that go with the
[02:00:58.400 --> 02:01:03.920]   service. I think they're calling it Tesla Connect or there's it's not official yet. But as usual,
[02:01:03.920 --> 02:01:09.920]   he will stick it to his early adapters, the people who made him what he is by not giving us the benefit
[02:01:09.920 --> 02:01:15.520]   of that great new option. So those of us who spend between five and 10,000, depending when you
[02:01:15.520 --> 02:01:19.520]   bought it, aren't going to get the benefit of that. If you really care, do you still have them?
[02:01:19.520 --> 02:01:23.760]   Give them the money. You don't the value of it though. Like you said, when you sell it,
[02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:27.680]   I mean, it is a $10,000 option that goes with the vehicle and it does increase.
[02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:32.880]   You don't get the tires either, right? Yeah. And if that car is a resale value,
[02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:41.040]   true for sure. But the car too, those vehicles are likely to go, some of these Teslas are going
[02:01:41.040 --> 02:01:48.080]   300, 400, 500,000 miles. You keep it for as long as that Tesla, as long as it goes,
[02:01:48.080 --> 02:01:54.000]   if you kept that car for 10 years, you still have the software as for the whole length of that,
[02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:58.400]   you know, it's going to be less than what you would pay for the, the, you know, rental fee,
[02:01:58.400 --> 02:02:04.160]   essentially, if you did the subscription. I'm just saying, just saying, and 10 years from now,
[02:02:04.160 --> 02:02:07.280]   I'm going to need a self-driving car because I'm going to be really old. Well, that's, you know,
[02:02:07.280 --> 02:02:12.480]   that's what I'm hoping. Yeah. It'll drive me to the nursing home. That's right. One-way trip.
[02:02:15.120 --> 02:02:22.320]   I could go on and on about Elon. He's getting sued by investors for tweeting.
[02:02:22.320 --> 02:02:30.080]   You know, the SEC said, stop tweeting. I wonder if the SEC might go after him for that. And then
[02:02:30.080 --> 02:02:35.840]   there is a report that, remember, Elon did not believe that COVID-19 should shut down his Tesla
[02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:41.440]   plant in Fremont. He opened it in violation of local regulations. And apparently now we're
[02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:48.640]   learning there were hundreds of cases as a result of Tesla workers who came back to work, had to
[02:02:48.640 --> 02:02:53.520]   come back to work, I guess. My biggest, my only real regret about buying a Tesla is that I'm feeding
[02:02:53.520 --> 02:02:58.800]   Elon because I think the guy's kind of a jerk. But he's kind of cool too. You know, he's kind of
[02:02:58.800 --> 02:03:03.200]   cool, but he's a little like Steve Jobs on steroids. I mean, Steve Jobs was an amazing,
[02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:07.840]   brilliant, incredible guy, but you wouldn't want to work for him. Yeah. Very similar.
[02:03:07.840 --> 02:03:12.320]   Musk is, yeah, similar, but probably probably worse in some ways. I don't know.
[02:03:12.320 --> 02:03:16.000]   This morning, this morning he launched that Falcon 9, put 60 more
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:22.800]   Starlink satellites up. Starlink is getting close. About 1000 satellites have been deployed. They
[02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:29.520]   need 1200 to do the preliminary first round, which means it'll probably be turned on soon.
[02:03:29.520 --> 02:03:36.080]   And oh yeah, by the way, the Falcon 9 booster came back to the, of course, I love you, Barge
[02:03:36.960 --> 02:03:42.480]   and landed perfectly stuck it, which makes this the ninth time it's been used,
[02:03:42.480 --> 02:03:47.920]   which is pretty amazing. And it's changed the economics of space launches.
[02:03:47.920 --> 02:03:57.840]   So Starlink, is anybody sign up for the Starlink yet? I know, I don't have to know a lot of people
[02:03:57.840 --> 02:04:04.880]   who have. No, but it's not testing it. Yeah. Yeah. Obviously, it sounds really interesting for,
[02:04:04.880 --> 02:04:09.360]   you know, a lot of folks in rural areas, you know, I speak to, you know, a lot of our readers are not
[02:04:09.360 --> 02:04:14.400]   in New York or San Francisco or kind of big urban cities. And I remember I was working on a magazine
[02:04:14.400 --> 02:04:18.080]   story, maybe it was a year ago, maybe two years ago, I spoke to a woman in Michigan.
[02:04:18.080 --> 02:04:23.600]   She doesn't have internet in her home. It doesn't exist. You know, she lives,
[02:04:23.600 --> 02:04:27.520]   it's a beautiful location. She said she was on a lake and you know, that's the trade.
[02:04:27.520 --> 02:04:31.840]   That's the trade you make. Yeah. To send an email, she would have to drive to, you know,
[02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:37.520]   some local bar restaurant to get good enough reception. So it's like, that's what it is for,
[02:04:37.520 --> 02:04:41.600]   maybe not that extreme, but there are a lot of places in this country where the internet is
[02:04:41.600 --> 02:04:47.040]   not particularly good. And so, you know, programs, companies like Starlink, that's
[02:04:47.040 --> 02:04:50.320]   actually kind of interesting. I don't know, you know, we'll see. I haven't tried, you know,
[02:04:50.320 --> 02:04:54.960]   CR has not tested it to be clear, but it sounds interesting and it sounds like it may feel a need
[02:04:54.960 --> 02:05:01.680]   that clearly a lot of folks have. It's also expensive. And I guess this is a first
[02:05:01.680 --> 02:05:06.720]   world issue because one of the visions of Starlink is to not only bring internet to that woman
[02:05:06.720 --> 02:05:12.720]   in Michigan who maybe can afford $499 for the satellite and $99 a month for the service,
[02:05:12.720 --> 02:05:17.600]   but also to bring it to corners of the world where internet isn't available. And there's not
[02:05:17.600 --> 02:05:23.120]   that much money. I'm hoping that they'll let the rich nations subsidize the poorer nations,
[02:05:23.120 --> 02:05:26.800]   because I think one of the visions for Starlink is to bring internet everywhere, right?
[02:05:27.840 --> 02:05:32.560]   I would call it. And there will be economies of scale. And also even, you know, what's what
[02:05:32.560 --> 02:05:40.400]   essentially in here is one connection to potentially one house. You know, they're in some of those
[02:05:40.400 --> 02:05:45.840]   places when you're going from... That's true. A town could buy a dish. Yeah. Exactly. You'll
[02:05:45.840 --> 02:05:51.280]   have a town or a village and they'll split it 10 ways or, you know, 20 ways or whatever. And at
[02:05:51.280 --> 02:05:58.480]   least if you have even a basic connection, that's an upgrade. And then over time, you know, as the
[02:05:58.480 --> 02:06:03.600]   technology scales and the bandwidth scales, then there's lots of potential there.
[02:06:03.600 --> 02:06:10.560]   It's not just Tesla or sorry, not just Starlink doing it on SpaceX, but there are two or three
[02:06:10.560 --> 02:06:16.560]   others that are going to be competing as well. So that's a good thing. When are you going to review
[02:06:16.560 --> 02:06:27.360]   it? TBD. It's in process. Like we don't actually have it yet, but we've got somebody who's getting
[02:06:27.360 --> 02:06:35.200]   it. And yeah, you can see, obviously, I want everyone to look at CNET's review. I'm biased
[02:06:35.200 --> 02:06:41.040]   and think it's going to be extremely comprehensive and helpful. But you can go on YouTube and there's
[02:06:41.040 --> 02:06:46.400]   a lot of people who have shared their experiences with it. So if you want to get it first,
[02:06:46.400 --> 02:06:53.360]   look at some of those, you absolutely can take a look at, you know, half a dozen, a dozen videos
[02:06:53.360 --> 02:06:59.200]   of different people and their experiences. They say I can order it now. It will come by mid
[02:06:59.200 --> 02:07:06.800]   to late 2021. It's not cheap for 99 a month for the, for 99 for the hardware, $99 a month for the
[02:07:06.800 --> 02:07:12.800]   service. They even have the nerve to charge me $50 for shipping and handling. I'd have to give them
[02:07:12.800 --> 02:07:18.160]   99 bucks now to get into the program. I might do that. That's refundable.
[02:07:18.160 --> 02:07:21.360]   Kind of like ordering of Keflitz. It's interesting. Similar model.
[02:07:21.360 --> 02:07:26.240]   It's very similar. Yeah. It is refundable. So, you know, just like the Tesla, you could,
[02:07:26.240 --> 02:07:32.720]   he still has my, I should get my money back for the Model 3 deposit I put down a couple years.
[02:07:32.720 --> 02:07:38.480]   Probably, probably not going to buy it at this point. All right. I might know, I think I should
[02:07:38.480 --> 02:07:44.240]   order it because I think we should review it. I mean, I presume, am I going to have to contract for
[02:07:44.240 --> 02:07:49.440]   a year or something? Or can I just turn it off after a month or two? I don't know, off to figure
[02:07:49.440 --> 02:07:52.160]   it out. Can you move it? Like, let's say you move, let's say you had a vacation house in the
[02:07:52.160 --> 02:07:57.840]   boonies. Yeah, you should be able to move it with you. I would hope so. I think so. Yeah. I mean,
[02:07:57.840 --> 02:08:04.720]   they're talking about eventually they're going to probably build the satellite into potentially
[02:08:05.760 --> 02:08:14.560]   and potentially into like the Tesla semi, you know. And also even they mentioned
[02:08:14.560 --> 02:08:23.280]   they mentioned airplanes and boats as also possible to have this, right? So those are
[02:08:23.280 --> 02:08:28.880]   things that move. They still think in cities, they've said this recently, they still think in cities
[02:08:28.880 --> 02:08:31.920]   that it's going to make more sense for people to use the cellular network.
[02:08:31.920 --> 02:08:37.920]   Oh, interesting. So it really is best for people who just like that Michigan lady just really don't
[02:08:37.920 --> 02:08:41.520]   have a choice or have such bad internet because they're so far off the grid that.
[02:08:41.520 --> 02:08:48.000]   No, no, I agree. There doesn't be a lot of thirst or for, you know, it's not just like
[02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:52.240]   internet connection. Oh, I could, I could, you know, watch funny cat videos, which is fine, whatever.
[02:08:52.240 --> 02:08:56.800]   But like how much of culture is now just coming through the internet? You can't watch Netflix.
[02:08:56.800 --> 02:09:02.240]   You can't do HTML, Macs. You can't live stream this show. It's like so much of, you know,
[02:09:02.240 --> 02:09:06.080]   compared to 15 years ago, you didn't, you know, if you didn't have a broad main connection,
[02:09:06.080 --> 02:09:11.760]   it wasn't necessarily that big of a deal. Today, it feels way more critical to just be kept in the
[02:09:11.760 --> 02:09:16.240]   loop of what's going on and to like participate in society to have a reliable, you know, this is
[02:09:16.240 --> 02:09:20.320]   that digital divide, which consumer reports covers very closely. It's like folks are getting left
[02:09:20.320 --> 02:09:25.760]   behind through no fault of their own. And that's, and that's bad, you know, not to obviously not to
[02:09:25.760 --> 02:09:30.320]   endorse Starlink. We haven't tested it. I don't have it. I've seen a YouTube video on it. The guy
[02:09:30.320 --> 02:09:36.560]   seemed, you know, fairly satisfied with it. But like services like that may, you know,
[02:09:36.560 --> 02:09:41.120]   maybe just put folks are looking for it. It may be the federal government needs to subsidize it.
[02:09:41.120 --> 02:09:47.600]   Like they did universal access to electricity in the, in the 30s with the TVA and other things.
[02:09:47.600 --> 02:09:54.480]   The House and Senate unveiled a new $94 billion proposal this week to make broadband internet
[02:09:54.480 --> 02:10:02.080]   more accessible and affordable nationwide. Really to address that issue of people who are off the,
[02:10:02.080 --> 02:10:08.720]   off the grid, off the internet. And who can't participate in a modern economy. Who can't, you know,
[02:10:08.720 --> 02:10:14.000]   get work who who can't learn the information they need to be good voters, all of that stuff.
[02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:19.120]   It's called the accessible affordable internet for all act. It will, of course, you know,
[02:10:19.120 --> 02:10:22.960]   be heavily debated. It's a significant investment. But I think it's the kind of investment that
[02:10:22.960 --> 02:10:26.880]   make a big difference. It's the modern day Tennessee Valley Authority, you know,
[02:10:26.880 --> 02:10:31.360]   which electrified rural America long after urban America was electrified.
[02:10:31.360 --> 02:10:36.480]   Yeah. We've needed that for a long time. Well, all right, you talked me into it.
[02:10:36.480 --> 02:10:41.040]   I just ordered a Starlink. So you'll see. I realized, you know, you're right, Jason,
[02:10:41.040 --> 02:10:44.480]   you got to review it. I mean, people, there's going to be, once they start rolling out,
[02:10:44.480 --> 02:10:48.800]   there's going to be vast interest. I don't need it. I get gigabit from Comcast at home.
[02:10:49.600 --> 02:10:55.840]   We get 10 gigabits from Sonic here. So I'm really not going to benefit. But I think we should review
[02:10:55.840 --> 02:11:00.960]   it. We should take a look at it and set it up. So I'll order it. It's part of our job.
[02:11:00.960 --> 02:11:04.880]   Cool. Our show date on your boat. I'll put it. Well, that's why I really want it.
[02:11:04.880 --> 02:11:10.480]   On your yacht, you know, you know, I, you know what I want? I want to suitcase size
[02:11:10.480 --> 02:11:15.760]   Starlink that I can carry around. So if as I'm traveling, I could still do the shows,
[02:11:15.760 --> 02:11:22.400]   that kind of thing. If, you know, wouldn't that be awesome? Yeah. That's my dream.
[02:11:22.400 --> 02:11:28.560]   Then I'll never retire. So long as I could do this, you know, from Morocco or the Maldives or
[02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:34.160]   the Seychelles, I would be happy. I'll be happy. I don't know. I could go to Barb. Actually,
[02:11:34.160 --> 02:11:40.320]   we have a friend, one of our sponsors who spent the last six months in Barbados.
[02:11:42.080 --> 02:11:46.960]   Because, you know, they have that visa that where you could be, you could do your business from Barbados.
[02:11:46.960 --> 02:11:51.040]   He loved it. I asked him, well, the bandwidth because I need to have, I need to have a good enough
[02:11:51.040 --> 02:11:55.520]   bandwidth to not only do the show, but have a green screen behind me so nobody would know that
[02:11:55.520 --> 02:12:00.480]   I'm in Barbados. And I said, oh, the bandwidth's better than at home. This guy works for a big
[02:12:00.480 --> 02:12:04.880]   bandwidth company. He knows. He said the bandwidth was fantastic. They have fiber to the island.
[02:12:04.880 --> 02:12:08.560]   And I guess they're affluent enough that they have very, very good internet.
[02:12:10.480 --> 02:12:16.480]   My only concern is if you saw me on a beach doing the show, you might not feel too happy.
[02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:18.960]   I see you in a Hawaiian shirt. I know what you look like.
[02:12:18.960 --> 02:12:22.400]   I could wear a Hawaiian shirt. I could be on the beach right now. You don't know. I maybe
[02:12:22.400 --> 02:12:29.360]   were in suit on the beach. It could be a filter. It's all a filter. It's great. For all we know,
[02:12:29.360 --> 02:12:32.960]   Nicholas doesn't have bricks behind him. You just don't know. That's part of the
[02:12:32.960 --> 02:12:38.160]   Sunday we're going to, we're going to dial into the show, you know, as a guest. It's like,
[02:12:38.160 --> 02:12:42.000]   it's going to look just like it is now. But Leo's going to say this episode brought to you by
[02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:45.920]   the Costa Rican, you know, better business bureau. And then we're going to know like, okay,
[02:12:45.920 --> 02:12:50.720]   he's not even there. Hello, man. It's time for Confrito everybody.
[02:12:50.720 --> 02:12:57.200]   While we do this weekend take our show today brought to you by Express VPN. Hey, even if I'm
[02:12:57.200 --> 02:13:04.560]   here, I can pretend I'm in Barbados or London. If I want to watch Netflix, UK or Tokyo, if I
[02:13:04.560 --> 02:13:10.880]   want to watch Netflix, Japan, I, this is absolutely shocking, but it is completely legal
[02:13:10.880 --> 02:13:16.080]   for internet service providers to gather every bit of what you're doing online and sell it to
[02:13:16.080 --> 02:13:22.160]   marketers. T-Mobile just announced a change in their privacy policy saying they were going to do
[02:13:22.160 --> 02:13:31.040]   exactly that. Whether it's a mobile carrier or your home internet, you're being spied on. And as we
[02:13:31.040 --> 02:13:37.040]   now know, incognito mode does not hide your activity from them. It just hides it from your spouse or
[02:13:37.040 --> 02:13:41.520]   your nosey roommate. So no matter what you're doing or how often you clear your browsing history,
[02:13:41.520 --> 02:13:46.640]   you're in a provider can see every single site you visit. They can see every search you do.
[02:13:46.640 --> 02:13:51.840]   That's why when you're at home, when you probably should use Express VPN,
[02:13:51.840 --> 02:13:58.080]   never go online without Express VPN. Express VPN is very easy to do. There are routers.
[02:13:58.080 --> 02:14:01.920]   You could put Express VPN on routers. They support many routers. You could put on any machine.
[02:14:01.920 --> 02:14:06.240]   You could put on your phone. You could even put on your smart television. What Express VPN does
[02:14:06.240 --> 02:14:11.520]   is it hides your IP address. In a sense, instead of using your IP address, you're using Express
[02:14:11.520 --> 02:14:16.400]   VPN's IP address. So if you do a Google search, Google doesn't know it's you. They just know
[02:14:16.400 --> 02:14:22.560]   it's coming from that IP address. That's not you. It doesn't matter if you get your internet from
[02:14:22.560 --> 02:14:27.360]   Verizon or Comcast or any of their local ISP. It's completely legal in the US for them
[02:14:27.360 --> 02:14:30.960]   to gather and sell your information to advertisers. Leo, if I could just make one caution, if you
[02:14:30.960 --> 02:14:34.640]   order pizza and you're logged in through London, make sure you get a pizza place.
[02:14:34.640 --> 02:14:41.840]   Do you think the proper address don't have your pizza delivered to Trafalgar Square? That won't
[02:14:41.840 --> 02:14:47.840]   do you anymore. It's really fun to do Google searches when I have Express VPN. When I tell
[02:14:47.840 --> 02:14:52.240]   it I'm fit in another country and I do a Google search, I get a whole different idea.
[02:14:52.240 --> 02:14:57.840]   Oh, it's actually very interesting, isn't it? Yeah. And by the way, it's really important.
[02:14:57.840 --> 02:15:03.440]   I'm glad to hear you have Express VPN because what people, sure, any VPN will do this. The problem
[02:15:03.440 --> 02:15:08.560]   is the private you're just kicking the privacy can down the road. The VPN now sees everything that
[02:15:08.560 --> 02:15:13.680]   Comcast saw or Google saw. So you really want to make sure you use a VPN provider that doesn't log,
[02:15:13.680 --> 02:15:18.880]   doesn't track you and Express VPN actually goes the extra mile, not only not to log you, but to
[02:15:18.880 --> 02:15:24.240]   make it impossible to log you. They use a trusted server technology that when you go to Express VPN,
[02:15:24.240 --> 02:15:30.320]   when you push that button that turns it on, it spins up the VPN server in RAM. It's sandboxed,
[02:15:30.320 --> 02:15:35.360]   it cannot write to disk. And as soon as you log off, it's gone and literally no trace,
[02:15:35.360 --> 02:15:40.720]   no trace at all of what you just did online exists. It's gone forever. They don't know it.
[02:15:40.720 --> 02:15:46.320]   No one can know it. It's not free. They invest. It's reasonable. Seven bucks a month there abouts,
[02:15:46.320 --> 02:15:51.760]   but they invest in their bandwidth in their servers. And that's why you can watch Netflix in the UK
[02:15:51.760 --> 02:15:58.080]   because it's fast enough. You won't even know you're using it. And you're able to watch HD video.
[02:15:58.080 --> 02:16:05.200]   Even on your smart TV, you can use Express VPN to protect you. Truthfully, if you have a smart TV,
[02:16:05.200 --> 02:16:11.920]   you really need Express VPN. Because if you think your ISP is bad, your smart TV vendor is far,
[02:16:12.560 --> 02:16:17.680]   far worse. They know everything you're doing on that television. Protect your online activity
[02:16:17.680 --> 02:16:23.440]   today. Get the VPN, see net rates number one, wired rates number one. The one I use,
[02:16:23.440 --> 02:16:29.120]   the only one I recommend the one Larry uses Express VPN.com slash to it. We've got a good deal for
[02:16:29.120 --> 02:16:34.000]   you. When you buy a one year package, you'll get three extra months free. Protect your privacy.
[02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:39.760]   Eliminate geographic restrictions. Protect yourself against people snooping on you.
[02:16:39.760 --> 02:16:43.360]   It's Express VPN. It's the only one I use Express VPN.com slash
[02:16:43.360 --> 02:16:46.960]   Twitter Express VPN dot com slash.
[02:16:46.960 --> 02:16:52.080]   I got it when I was in Turkey because I wanted to exit YouTube and Erdogan was
[02:16:52.080 --> 02:16:56.480]   blocking YouTube at the time. So yeah, great. And you've used it ever since. That's awesome.
[02:16:56.480 --> 02:16:59.600]   Yeah, I know. And of course, whenever I travel, especially if I'm in Russia,
[02:16:59.600 --> 02:17:04.560]   Turkey or China, if I'm allowed to use a VPN, which I think so far, I've been able to.
[02:17:04.560 --> 02:17:07.520]   Oh, that's interesting. You really want to use it there. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:17:08.080 --> 02:17:12.000]   For a lot of a lot of reasons, partly because you can't get anything you want.
[02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:15.440]   That's right. You can't go to the places you want. But whatever you do,
[02:17:15.440 --> 02:17:18.160]   don't share your Netflix password. Okay.
[02:17:18.160 --> 02:17:25.360]   Apparently emails are going out now. They want to everybody who doesn't share.
[02:17:25.360 --> 02:17:30.800]   The thing is in the Netflix terms of services says you can only share it with people in your
[02:17:30.800 --> 02:17:35.520]   household. Well, my kids are in my household. They don't live with me anymore, but they're
[02:17:35.520 --> 02:17:43.120]   still my kids. So that's the question. What is household? They are now sending out emails.
[02:17:43.120 --> 02:17:49.120]   They're letting people know if you don't live with the owner of this account, you need your own
[02:17:49.120 --> 02:17:56.080]   account to keep watching and you'll need to verify it with an email or an SMS text message.
[02:17:56.080 --> 02:18:00.880]   Otherwise, if you want to watch your this is this is a test. Netflix says,
[02:18:01.920 --> 02:18:08.480]   I imagine they're going to wait and see how many screams of pain. A Netflix person told the
[02:18:08.480 --> 02:18:13.840]   streamable.com this test is designed to help ensure people using Netflix are authorized to do so.
[02:18:13.840 --> 02:18:19.600]   It still isn't clear if users in the test all need to have the same IP address to be in the
[02:18:19.600 --> 02:18:25.120]   same household. And I'm not sure what they would do if you were using a VPN IP address.
[02:18:25.120 --> 02:18:31.520]   You'll have to let me know. They might block you. They've been very good in the past. I mean,
[02:18:31.520 --> 02:18:35.520]   one of the reasons I use Netflix is an example. I actually inquired because I thought, well,
[02:18:35.520 --> 02:18:39.680]   I don't want to recommend something Netflix is against. They said, no, if you have a subscription,
[02:18:39.680 --> 02:18:46.080]   if you're paying for Netflix, you can use Netflix Japan with a VPN. That's fine. You pay for it.
[02:18:46.080 --> 02:18:50.880]   The only reason they say we don't recommend it is because the video quality won't be so good.
[02:18:50.880 --> 02:18:55.760]   But they say it's not against the rules. I'm in the same situation. I have adult kids and they
[02:18:55.760 --> 02:19:01.040]   live in their own places. But and I think if they were to take away that ability and we actually
[02:19:01.040 --> 02:19:05.680]   pay more, we pay more to Netflix for the ability to for people to log on at one.
[02:19:05.680 --> 02:19:08.960]   Exactly. I have a premium plan for that very reason so they can all watch.
[02:19:08.960 --> 02:19:13.360]   There are enough competitors out there that if they start messing around with people,
[02:19:13.360 --> 02:19:18.880]   I think people are just going to go off to HBO Max or Hulu or the ton of places now.
[02:19:18.880 --> 02:19:21.200]   They no longer have the monopoly on streaming.
[02:19:21.200 --> 02:19:26.560]   I think Netflix has said for a long time, it doesn't cost us that much. The password sharing
[02:19:26.560 --> 02:19:33.760]   is not hurting us. Now, maybe it's starting to. According to research for Maggie, no relations.
[02:19:33.760 --> 02:19:40.320]   He says, "Maggad, you say, "Maggad"? I say, "Maggad." You say, "Maggad." Yeah. Are you a relation?
[02:19:40.320 --> 02:19:44.960]   I'm hoping to block, "Shay, I'm hoping to block, "Shay, we protect the word "Maggad." You need to have an NFT.
[02:19:44.960 --> 02:19:51.600]   Maggie measured that 35% of millennials share passwords for streaming. 35%.
[02:19:52.720 --> 02:19:56.640]   That seems low. I think Maggie has got something. Yes, I agree.
[02:19:56.640 --> 02:20:03.120]   That's right. You are a millennial, aren't you, Nicholas? You're right on the edge.
[02:20:03.120 --> 02:20:09.520]   I think I'm right in the... I just turned 35, so I think I am like kind of middle-of-road average
[02:20:09.520 --> 02:20:17.600]   millennial. I've always heard that it's Mark Zuckerberg, who is 36. Yeah, he's the borderline.
[02:20:17.600 --> 02:20:22.480]   So if you're older than Mark, you're out. If your Mark's age or younger, you're in.
[02:20:22.480 --> 02:20:27.600]   They did some research and they discovered there are three millennials in America who are
[02:20:27.600 --> 02:20:31.840]   actually paying for Netflix. That's probably more like it. Yes, I would guess.
[02:20:31.840 --> 02:20:37.520]   Yeah. I can say that I don't know any millennial that actually pays for it.
[02:20:37.520 --> 02:20:46.640]   No. It's a test group of one. But I think part of it is they will eventually over time,
[02:20:46.640 --> 02:20:53.440]   right? It's like people were saying that, "Oh, the housing market is over.
[02:20:53.440 --> 02:21:00.560]   Millennials aren't going to buy houses." Well, they aged into it. It's fine. Now,
[02:21:00.560 --> 02:21:05.360]   the housing market is roaring because so many millennials are buying houses.
[02:21:05.360 --> 02:21:10.960]   It is an opportunity, though. I really like what Larry was saying about. It's an opportunity for
[02:21:10.960 --> 02:21:18.480]   some of the other places to say, "Look, you want to share with your family and you guys are in
[02:21:18.480 --> 02:21:24.480]   different places? Go for it. Who cares? Pay us the extra family plan and we're happy to let you do it."
[02:21:24.480 --> 02:21:30.960]   Well, that's what Apple does. Apple does. If 100 people are using your, sure.
[02:21:30.960 --> 02:21:34.320]   That's different. There should be some reasonable number where they look the other way.
[02:21:34.320 --> 02:21:39.760]   But that's one way that they enforce that by saying, "Well, you can only have four streams at a time."
[02:21:39.760 --> 02:21:42.400]   So if 100 people are using it, you're not going to be able to watch your Netflix.
[02:21:42.400 --> 02:21:51.600]   You're going to pretty quickly change the password. I think one way that millennials can afford
[02:21:51.600 --> 02:21:59.440]   is by buying stonks. That's the key. Get into the stonk market. I'm sure a few millennials bought
[02:21:59.440 --> 02:22:08.320]   roblox when they went public this week. If they did, they did okay. $38 billion market cap.
[02:22:09.360 --> 02:22:15.760]   This is their public offering. They were valued in the private market in January
[02:22:15.760 --> 02:22:23.040]   at $29.5 billion. This is a pretty big jump. The stock closed at $69.50.
[02:22:23.040 --> 02:22:29.280]   I don't know roblox. I don't know any kids that age.
[02:22:29.280 --> 02:22:38.400]   It's like digital legos. If you go to kadexafree.org, you can read our parents' guide to roblox. They're
[02:22:38.400 --> 02:22:42.640]   one of our supporters. They're great company. We really enjoyed working with them. I wish
[02:22:42.640 --> 02:22:46.800]   instead of getting a grant, I got some stock in the company instead. No, kid.
[02:22:46.800 --> 02:22:54.320]   But no, they work really hard. They market it well and they give kids lots of opportunities
[02:22:54.320 --> 02:23:02.960]   to spend more money. Oh, yeah. Robox. Robox. I think we have to think about how to use your kid's
[02:23:02.960 --> 02:23:10.880]   faith on roblox. What parents worry about? There's investments. It's a little deceiving.
[02:23:10.880 --> 02:23:17.840]   The way a lot of these work, especially SPACs, a lot of these companies that are going. Robox
[02:23:17.840 --> 02:23:26.320]   is a good solid company. I think it's a long term. If you're an investor, it's probably a good thing.
[02:23:26.320 --> 02:23:32.880]   But these companies now that are especially high profile, have high profile consumer products,
[02:23:32.880 --> 02:23:40.080]   they come to market. The people who are the insiders who paid for the stock and got it at a
[02:23:40.080 --> 02:23:44.240]   reasonable price, they make a lot of money because as soon as it hits the market,
[02:23:44.240 --> 02:23:50.720]   the stock goes way up. Then almost always in the first year, it drops off by 20%.
[02:23:50.720 --> 02:23:55.520]   Well, this might really happen this year because roblox benefited hugely from COVID.
[02:23:56.160 --> 02:24:02.560]   Because all those kids were home with nothing to do. So users were through the roof. I wonder
[02:24:02.560 --> 02:24:08.000]   what's going to happen. Actually, who was it that wrote an article about? Was it you, Larry?
[02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:13.680]   About when COVID ends, what the world's going to look like? Yeah, I have a piece in the
[02:24:13.680 --> 02:24:17.920]   Mercury News this week about what the world's going to look like. One of the comments I made,
[02:24:17.920 --> 02:24:21.200]   I think we talked with this earlier, is that television will never be the same. I mean,
[02:24:21.200 --> 02:24:26.960]   what we're doing now, remotely being interviewed by you, is newly commented.
[02:24:26.960 --> 02:24:31.680]   So funny. When this first started, I mean, we're now exactly a year. This is a one-year anniversary
[02:24:31.680 --> 02:24:38.800]   of locking down. And all the new channels started doing what we do, what we've done for 15 years.
[02:24:38.800 --> 02:24:43.440]   And it was hysterical for me to watch their learning curve progress as ours did. Don't let
[02:24:43.440 --> 02:24:49.280]   them use those Apple headphones. Oh, I can hear the scratching. Oh my God, the guy's off mic.
[02:24:49.280 --> 02:24:54.160]   He's muted. All of that stuff. It was really fun to watch, but they've got it down now pretty well.
[02:24:54.160 --> 02:24:59.200]   There's no reason to go back to anything else. I don't think there's a lot of examples where
[02:24:59.200 --> 02:25:05.040]   I'm hoping that restaurant deliveries continue to do okay. I mean, I'm looking forward to going
[02:25:05.040 --> 02:25:11.280]   back to rest. I hope there's some restaurants still left to go to. I had never had groceries
[02:25:11.280 --> 02:25:15.040]   delivered before the pandemic. And that's the only way we get groceries now. That's not going
[02:25:15.040 --> 02:25:20.400]   to stick up. And I think I'm going to probably continue doing that, to some extent. So,
[02:25:20.400 --> 02:25:26.560]   there are elements that will stay with us. And maybe Roblox will be one of them. Maybe the kids
[02:25:26.560 --> 02:25:34.000]   will continue to play. Oh, also telemedicine. I have been to my doctor several times this year
[02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:37.920]   without actually being to my doctor. And it's actually been a better experience. And I was
[02:25:37.920 --> 02:25:43.920]   telling you earlier, I can do my own EKG. I can do my own blood pressure pretty soon.
[02:25:43.920 --> 02:25:47.520]   Supposedly Apple is going to do blood glucose over your watch. I mean,
[02:25:47.520 --> 02:25:55.200]   just don't do your own surgery at home. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, Larry. Now hold the scalpel at a
[02:25:55.200 --> 02:26:00.720]   slight angle. My wife does do my hair cutting. Oh, yeah, we're getting close. You see, it's
[02:26:00.720 --> 02:26:06.880]   it's baby steps. Yeah, baby steps. They'll just send a robot to Larry's house, a robot surgeon.
[02:26:06.880 --> 02:26:12.480]   And then somebody with, you know, AR will actually perform the surgery. That may actually
[02:26:12.480 --> 02:26:16.800]   that may not be so far off. We can crowdsource it. See, you know, if he'll give you the best deal
[02:26:16.800 --> 02:26:21.440]   on it. One of those little Amazon delivery things will trundle up to your doorstop. Say,
[02:26:21.440 --> 02:26:26.640]   pick me up, bring me in. I'm going to do the surgery. That'll be a future feature. You buy one of
[02:26:26.640 --> 02:26:31.600]   these Amazon robots. And it's like now, now doing surgeries. So if you need a surgery,
[02:26:31.600 --> 02:26:36.080]   your Amazon home robot will actually do it. You just contract with the doctor, you know,
[02:26:36.080 --> 02:26:41.040]   in Minnesota. It's a great topic. We've talked a lot about it on various shows because, you know,
[02:26:41.040 --> 02:26:44.640]   this is there's going to be a new normal. But I do think one thing that's going to happen.
[02:26:44.640 --> 02:26:50.480]   I'm I'm now convinced because we're already seeing people do it prematurely is people can't wait
[02:26:50.480 --> 02:26:57.360]   to go to restaurants, to go to concerts, to just go to a bar and hang out to breathe on each other.
[02:26:57.360 --> 02:27:02.080]   They just can't wait to do that. And I do think that there'll be this kind of this summer might
[02:27:02.080 --> 02:27:06.720]   be kind of crazy. I got my second shot a week ago. So technically in a week from now, I'm
[02:27:06.720 --> 02:27:12.320]   as immune as I'll ever be. But I'm going to take baby. My biggest baby step is I'm going to go
[02:27:12.320 --> 02:27:22.000]   grocery shopping next weekend. I have party party on aisle six. Three masks and gloves,
[02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:27.440]   but I'll go grocery show. I think you're right. Tech, as you write in the Mercury News will become
[02:27:27.440 --> 02:27:34.160]   the new normal after getting us through a tough year. Here's some good news. We can end the show
[02:27:34.160 --> 02:27:43.120]   with University at Buffalo has created a deep fake spotting tool that is 94% effective
[02:27:43.120 --> 02:27:50.880]   with portrait style photos. People have been very worried about deep fakes. I just I just saw
[02:27:50.880 --> 02:28:00.400]   a mom got arrested for creating deep fakes of other members of the cheerleading squad to help her
[02:28:00.400 --> 02:28:05.680]   start or get on the cheerleading squad. And I thought, Oh, this has become way too common.
[02:28:05.680 --> 02:28:10.560]   Now we got a problem. But this tool apparently is very effective
[02:28:10.560 --> 02:28:18.880]   because it looks at the light in the eye, the anything that's coming to the eye with a light
[02:28:18.880 --> 02:28:24.480]   emitting from these sources will have an image on the cornea. So if you compare the two eyes,
[02:28:24.480 --> 02:28:29.840]   they should have very similar reflective patterns because there's the same seeing the same things.
[02:28:29.840 --> 02:28:33.840]   And this artificial intelligence has been able to by looking at the eyes,
[02:28:33.840 --> 02:28:43.200]   figure out if it's real or a deep fake 94% effective. Good news, I guess,
[02:28:43.200 --> 02:28:47.600]   except for now that we know how it operates. Can people then get off course?
[02:28:47.600 --> 02:28:54.960]   Of course. Oh, well, never mind. Never mind. It would seem like a good,
[02:28:54.960 --> 02:28:58.480]   seem like a good high high story to end on, but you've just ruined it.
[02:28:58.480 --> 02:29:06.400]   I want to thank you all for joining us. What a fun show. Nicholas, it's great to have you.
[02:29:06.400 --> 02:29:11.360]   Now that you've been here, please come back. See you says it's okay, right? Yes, they do.
[02:29:11.360 --> 02:29:15.280]   Thank you. Yeah, I'm happy to come back whenever whenever you'll have me.
[02:29:15.280 --> 02:29:21.440]   I just paid my whatever it is used to be 20 bucks. I think it's gone up for 30 now.
[02:29:21.440 --> 02:29:25.360]   Sure. What a deal. That's the best deal ever for consumer reports.
[02:29:25.360 --> 02:29:29.840]   I don't buy anything without looking it up. I'm like, in fact, my wife thinks I'm, you know,
[02:29:29.840 --> 02:29:39.280]   okay, go check consumer reports. I refuse to buy anything without reading consumer reports.
[02:29:39.280 --> 02:29:42.400]   There's a lot of actually free content. Do they make your content free or not?
[02:29:42.400 --> 02:29:47.760]   I think the bulk of my stories on the website are free.
[02:29:48.800 --> 02:29:53.360]   That's good. I think the ratings are behind the paywall.
[02:29:53.360 --> 02:29:58.240]   Yes. I think that's right. The iPhone score was or whatever that you have to pay for. Or if you
[02:29:58.240 --> 02:30:02.880]   have printer or just ask me, I'll share my password with you. Yeah. Yeah.
[02:30:02.880 --> 02:30:08.640]   I don't know what our rules are regarding. I'm sure it's not encouraged.
[02:30:08.640 --> 02:30:15.360]   But yeah, I'm so loved it. And I was sincere when I said there was a very much an inspiration
[02:30:16.000 --> 02:30:22.320]   when I started to it on how I wanted to handle reviews and how I wanted to have this
[02:30:22.320 --> 02:30:28.880]   church and state. Originally, when we started to it, we didn't want to take advertisers at all.
[02:30:28.880 --> 02:30:38.000]   Who knows? Maybe we'll go back to some sort of supported thing. I would love to do it that way.
[02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:42.160]   And consumer unions obviously figured out how to do it. They've been around for a long time.
[02:30:42.160 --> 02:30:46.080]   Yeah. Very like I say like 100 years. It's been a long time.
[02:30:46.080 --> 02:30:49.520]   You don't work in the testing lab or no?
[02:30:49.520 --> 02:30:53.600]   Yeah. The testing lab is in the main campus is in, like I said,
[02:30:53.600 --> 02:30:58.400]   it's in Yonkers, New York, which is a little bit north of New York City. Everything except the cars.
[02:30:58.400 --> 02:31:04.400]   The cars are done out of Connecticut somewhere. But everything else is done in the Yonkers facility.
[02:31:04.400 --> 02:31:08.720]   That's awesome. You know, computers. You sell it to the staff.
[02:31:08.720 --> 02:31:13.440]   Yeah. What happens to like if so you buy you actually buy the car to review it.
[02:31:13.440 --> 02:31:16.320]   You sell it off to the staff. Yeah. Okay.
[02:31:16.320 --> 02:31:19.200]   Thank you so much for being here. Come back again. Nicholas De Leon.
[02:31:19.200 --> 02:31:20.080]   Nice eating in your book.
[02:31:20.080 --> 02:31:22.160]   Yeah. It's great. Isn't he senior technology reporter?
[02:31:22.160 --> 02:31:22.640]   Yeah. Like what?
[02:31:22.640 --> 02:31:24.720]   Equ electronics reporter for a consumer.
[02:31:24.720 --> 02:31:25.600]   Younger than my daughter.
[02:31:25.600 --> 02:31:26.960]   Of course. Another story.
[02:31:26.960 --> 02:31:33.200]   Show us how old everybody's younger than your daughter Larry. Larry Megan. He's the
[02:31:33.200 --> 02:31:39.440]   old man in tech. Connect safely.org. He's got JFK's autograph at Larry Megan.
[02:31:39.440 --> 02:31:44.640]   Actually, I'm so jealous that that bumper sticker is awesome. That is awesome.
[02:31:44.640 --> 02:31:49.760]   Thank you for being here. Larry, connect safely.org is a great place to go for parents
[02:31:49.760 --> 02:31:52.880]   to understand what's going on in the internet and how to protect their young
[02:31:52.880 --> 02:31:59.120]   children there. You've got some really good resources, including that's cool that Roblox
[02:31:59.120 --> 02:32:02.880]   how to use Roblox safely. That's really good. I think a lot of parents look at Roblox
[02:32:02.880 --> 02:32:07.120]   say that's cool, but I don't know anything about it. So it's nice.
[02:32:07.120 --> 02:32:08.000]   We will educate you.
[02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:12.080]   Family guide to parental controls tips to remember and manage passwords.
[02:32:12.080 --> 02:32:13.840]   There it is. Parents guide to Roblox.
[02:32:13.840 --> 02:32:18.480]   Really cool. Really cool. Connect safely.org. Thank you, Larry.
[02:32:18.480 --> 02:32:22.560]   And of course, Jason Heiner, the man who elected me president of the internet.
[02:32:22.560 --> 02:32:25.920]   Thank you so much. I couldn't have done it without you, my friend.
[02:32:25.920 --> 02:32:30.560]   Editorial director at CNET now and a long time regular on the show.
[02:32:30.560 --> 02:32:34.720]   It's great to see you. Have a wonderful week. Anything you're working on that you want to share with us?
[02:32:34.720 --> 02:32:41.760]   Oh, well, we have a little mini package coming up this week on CNET talking about
[02:32:41.760 --> 02:32:47.920]   it's been a year, obviously since the shutdown since we all went home.
[02:32:47.920 --> 02:32:56.800]   So good stuff. We'll talk about Zoom anxiety in that series. We'll talk about the way services
[02:32:56.800 --> 02:33:01.280]   have revolutionized so many different things as we talked about on the show today.
[02:33:01.280 --> 02:33:04.320]   So yeah, come and check that out this week on CNET.
[02:33:04.320 --> 02:33:11.360]   And otherwise, we're covering all the stuff that everybody cares the most about in terms of
[02:33:11.360 --> 02:33:20.080]   consumer technology. So it's been a year where a lot of people have put a lot more faith and
[02:33:20.080 --> 02:33:24.080]   had to put a lot more faith in tech. And so it's been really interesting.
[02:33:24.080 --> 02:33:30.080]   It's been really fascinating year. And I'm sure that so many things have been changed
[02:33:30.080 --> 02:33:37.200]   for the future as well and accelerated. So it's going to be interesting to watch this year as we
[02:33:37.200 --> 02:33:42.480]   do go back to in person to see which things stick around and which things continue to
