[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Would you please?
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   This is one of those mics where you work it.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Yeah, and it sounds really good when you do that.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   John was in, you were, well, you've been traveling around,
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   you were in Washington State last week,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   and you're going to Amsterdam, what are you going to Amsterdam for?
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   "Queen's Day."
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   I know, that's what I said.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Amsterdam has a queen, is it Queen Beatrice?
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   I don't know, I can never keep track, but yes, something like that.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   But they have this big party on the last day of April,
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   which is called Queen's Day,
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   and I have to go to Amsterdam to visit with a software company anyway.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   So why not go on Queen's Day?
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Well, Queen's Day, and all the Dutch said,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   "Yeah, yeah, that's when you should come."
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Can I give you some chocolate to give Beatrice?
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Because she loves chocolate.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   I don't think I'm going to meet her.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   You're not? It's her day.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Well, you're not.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Doesn't she ride amongst the populace on a horse?
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   She does, I don't know.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   I thought she was supposed to find that.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Well, I know, apparently, it's just like one 24 hours of just people drinking in the streets,
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   and what's interesting is that everybody puts everything up that they have for sale out on the street,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   and everything that everybody sells.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Oh, it's fun.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Oh, their household stuff.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   They're like spring cleaning.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Yeah, spring day.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Also here from Vancouver, British Columbia,
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   we're really thrilled to have her back.

[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Hello, everyone.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Hi, Lisa Howard.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   It's hot in the studio today.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   It is really a little toasty, and I apologize.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   We've had some really hot days in the studio last summer,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   and I have air conditioning, but you know, it gets stuffy.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   So you can name the fan at you.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   I have aimed the fan.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   You know, it kind of looks like you have the model.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   It's just the model look going.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   So the hair's blowing.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   The hair's blowing.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Did you plan that?
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Maybe.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Smile for the camera.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Love the camera, baby.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Also here, we're really pleased for the first time.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Cheryla's are.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Hey, I'm so happy to be here.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Cheryla's are.com.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Cheryla, how would I describe what you do?
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   I described it as a hybrid journalist crossover personality.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   You know, some people call me a social media maven.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Literally everyone.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   You're an interesting customer.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   We talked about this a couple of tweets ago where people are going to J School all of a
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   sudden.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   You study broadcasting.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   And you got out of school and broadcasting is completely different from everything it
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   was.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Yeah, even a few years ago when I was like, do I want to either work at local news stations
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   to pursue what I love?
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   And I'm like, no, I don't want to be in the middle of nowhere reporting about murders.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   That's not what you have to do.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   You have to work your way up.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Well, that was the old model, but then I was in Los Angeles and it happened.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   And a lot of websites at the time were starting up and I was like, let me host your video
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   content.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Let me translate your content into video.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   And also sites that already had video.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.320]   You're a new class a person and just Dean, I just, Dean is one Lisa is another of your
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.320]   web personalities.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.640]   Yeah, but I also have in the midst of continuing online have been in traditional media and
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.560]   hosted shows on TV with NBC and direct TV.
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.560]   So you've done real stuff.
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.560]   So I've done.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.560]   Well, that's the thing I feel like.
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.560]   Oh boy, did I say that?
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.560]   Oh my God.
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.760]   Oh, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.760]   I'm sorry, Leo.
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:37.760]   You're going to.
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:38.760]   It's like as much as people.
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.520]   People say TV is dead and everything.
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.520]   There's still credibility when people.
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.520]   No, it's true.
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.520]   Real media.
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.720]   And it's like, oh, but you're saying that's all online.
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.960]   You think I know better than that.
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.120]   The buzz words of the TV.
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.520]   They say the same thing about the newspapers and everybody will admit this.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.440]   Even though the newspapers are dying, you could have a blog with 2 million readers on
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.360]   a daily basis and something gets printed in the newspaper and it has more impact.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.360]   It's genuine.
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.360]   Yeah.
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.360]   City government.
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.880]   So what do you say to people that it's like it's like it's like it's such hypocrisy in
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.960]   terms of saying that old or traditional media is dead, but then there's credibility in it.
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.800]   I think we all need to in the end work together.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.280]   Like for me, I say I'm in the audience business.
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.280]   So well, the.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.920]   Oh, well, that's interesting.
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:19.920]   Wait a minute.
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.920]   Let me get my head around that.
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:21.920]   I'm in the audience business.
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:27.320]   Well, that's I spoke about that at food camp with someone and I go, I don't it's not about
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.680]   like being against TV or being against online.
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.240]   Like, although online is my love and that's where I want to be.
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.440]   So you're saying I don't care where the audience what distribution means.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.440]   I create.
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.040]   I always said I'm in the content business.
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.680]   You say you're in the audience business.
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.400]   That's a very interesting distinction.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.760]   Do you not think content is important?
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.520]   I do think content is important.
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:49.520]   But which comes first?
[00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.520]   Do you say audience comes?
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.520]   No, I don't think so.
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.160]   But I think that in terms of engagement, it's about engaging people.
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.160]   Right.
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.160]   No, I'm actually.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.280]   I'm actually to make it work, not only just online, like I'm not about excluding the TV
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.280]   world, like an alienating them.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.840]   So I'm about if I have an online web series, I'm going to find a way for to engage the
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:10.840]   TV world as well.
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.160]   Like, maybe that's my marketing side coming in.
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.440]   So if I have a web show, I'll find a way to be a feature contributor on a TV network.
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:22.960]   I actually caution a lot of young people who say, oh, I'm in this so that I can get into
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.160]   mainstream media to say, don't worry so much about mainstream media.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.720]   I just probably said that to you, Lisa.
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:28.720]   Right.
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.040]   I mean, yeah, I think it's about finding your niche on the internet.
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:40.480]   And I mean, I've tried for years to make it in mainstream as an actor, as a model, and
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:46.200]   just being beaten down from that end and going into internet stuff.
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:54.880]   But I've always kept some bit of myself in mainstream with the work I'm doing for the
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.480]   Vancouver Province, like with a newspaper.
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.760]   You're still right for a newspaper.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:58.760]   Yeah.
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.240]   And I still do a radio show.
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.440]   I mean, we're all still doing some mainstream media.
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.880]   And the questions were, yeah, pioneers of, I say, new media and we understand it and
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:06.880]   want to be there.
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.960]   But is that because this stuff is still hanging around or because we really genuinely need
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:10.960]   to be part of it?
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:11.960]   There's more money there.
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:12.960]   Oh, the money part.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:13.960]   Yeah.
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:18.600]   I mean, that's the fact I still get paid more for being on TV than being online.
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.040]   But I think there's something about the conversation is different online.
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.520]   It's so much more exciting.
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:24.520]   That's what I think.
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.520]   I love the interaction.
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.680]   It's like online has always been there for me.
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.880]   And when you're off air, you continue your presence online.
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:32.880]   But that's on air too.
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.800]   You know, it's that you're continuing the life and your brand and your--
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.960]   Lisa, do you do the newspaper stuff to make a living?
[00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:39.960]   No.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:40.960]   It's important.
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:41.960]   There's no--
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.200]   But a province never has.
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:49.360]   It's almost like they're folding and they're sort of hiring more people like myself to come
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.120]   in and do these sort of little videos to pull people on.
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:56.040]   Yeah, I just feel sorry for people your age and shear his age because you're coming
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.000]   in at the tail end of this stuff.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.240]   Yes, but it's an exciting time too.
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.240]   There's opportunities.
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:06.880]   Well, like with my photography, it's sort of before maybe I'd put my pictures up in
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.480]   a gallery and I'd have 100 people see it.
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:15.160]   But I posted on Flickr and I get 20,000 people to see my work and get--
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.360]   and have this sort of online portfolio of my work.
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.920]   And I think that's really exciting.
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.440]   That's the thing you and I have always talked about, John, that the dirty little secret
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.440]   of mainstream media is the numbers are low.
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:29.640]   I mean, 20,000 people watching you on Flickr is a lot even compared to mainstream.
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:33.640]   Yeah, well the radio scene is definitely the case, especially local radio.
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:38.080]   In fact, you would-- this broadcast, if you want to call it that, if yours here, this
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:43.560]   thing, as it were, probably has 10 times the audience you would have if you were just--
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:44.560]   On a local station.
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.560]   --a KGO or something, especially on a Sunday.
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:50.880]   The numbers on this show are the same as my national radio show, which is in 61 markets
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.720]   and on X-App and in Canada.
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.240]   So that gives you some idea.
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:58.320]   But why are people-- I feel like there's credibility and legitimacy there, but why is
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.280]   there still kind of a bit of a--
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.280]   Stuff's just hanging out.
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:03.280]   Stuff's just hanging.
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.280]   It's the old-- it just takes a while to die.
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.080]   It's people haven't gotten over that.
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.440]   I think it's more than that.
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.640]   I think it's because it's diluted.
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:13.640]   Web media still.
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.880]   There's just too many schmucks that are just trying to do it.
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.680]   And a lot of amateurs.
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.080]   And it's a smoke screen.
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.880]   That's probably hurt podcasting in the sense that most of the time when you listen to a
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.640]   podcast, it's really bad.
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.400]   So the assumption is, well, podcast is going to be bad.
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.920]   It's not that many slick podcasts or anything like that.
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.440]   But that's what has happened is the democratization of the media.
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.400]   And I think we think that's a good thing, right?
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.360]   Because it means anybody can have a voice and everybody gets a chance.
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.360]   Yeah.
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.360]   I don't know.
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.360]   You said a really good thing that everybody has a voice.
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.360]   I'm not so sure.
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.000]   Well, you're creating-- well, I think it's going to make the people.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.880]   It's going to weed out the people that are making money or the professionals.
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:52.720]   And the people around them are the ones that will be saying-- it's like the commons.
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:57.000]   It's like the people that are making money or the people that are making money.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   And it's going to make money.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   And it's going to make money.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   And it's going to make money.

[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   And it's going to make money.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   Yeah, I'm a host that sounds weird, but I'm like because I a lot of things I do.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   You host community.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   But I host a community.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   That's an interesting, I like that way of looking at it.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   I think of it as definitely kind of opposite.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   Like it's about the content.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   You produce good content and then screw everything else.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   But the world continues.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   The conversation continues because if there's more than just your content.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   Like if you just say, oh sorry, this is all it is, then you're putting yourself in a box.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   But then you have to say the conversation continues beyond.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   Then I feel like it leaves it to infinite possibility.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   Why don't you care about the conversation afterwards, Lisa?
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   Well, I do.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   But it's the way I feel about my blog now is I spend all this time creating this content
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   that I believe in that I'm passionate about.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   And then I get some jerk saying like, you suck.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   But it's about, all right, you have one of those.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   But we all do.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   It's not just one of them though.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   It's the sheer mass inequality.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   Followers now.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   So I just got a note from Adam Curry.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   Your parents listening to this show as we speak.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   Oh, cool.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   His comment.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   Oh, brother.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   Oh, no.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   He's just jealous.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   How many people listen to his show?
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   That's all.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   Hey, I do.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Hey, I do.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   Hey, you were, I know.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   You were, and it's a good thing you do.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   You were at Food Camp, sure, Lazar.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   What is food camp?
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   What is food camp?
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   And how can we?
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   It's friends of O'Reilly's.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   Friends of O'Reilly's.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   I'm friends of O'Reilly.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   Are you?
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   I do.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   Apparently not his friend.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   You're not his friend.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   But you're like within the neighborhood.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   Now, you try, you see, you do this to me, John.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   And then I get in trouble.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   John, see, we've worked together a long time.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   John tries to play on my petty resentful side.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   He tries to bring out the petty resentful Leo.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   There's plenty you say that, but it's not true.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   I'm just wanting, I'm trying to get the facts out.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   You know, why does a guy, he's like right down the street from you.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   He's in Sebastopol, as a matter of fact.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   He knows you exist.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   I've had him on my--
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   It's not like him inviting, like he's personal.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   Actually, in this case, it wasn't.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   But, okay, let's face it.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   He never invited me to food camp.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   Oh, no, really?
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   No.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   We need to get you invited.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   You know who invited this time?
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   Julia Allison.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   Ooh.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   Now I'm heard.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   But it was Dave Morin and Dave--
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   Dave Morin from Facebook.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   Dave Rachorden, who used to be at Six Apart.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   And so they, they was their camp.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   How many people were there?
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   This is social, this is social web food.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   How many people were there?
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   Social 150 people.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   There was 150 people and you weren't invited?
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   You know what, really?
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   The only thing, the only time that I felt a little twinge,
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   because I can't go anyway, I'm doing this.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   But the only time I felt a little twinge was when I saw a tweet from somebody saying,
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   "We're all discussing the future of internet television right now.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   This is exciting."
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   I wanted to say that.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   I remember that.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   It was her.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   Maybe you should get some more followers, Leo.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   Make her.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   You're trying to get me to--
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   No.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   Sorry.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   Yeah, you just put up the URL on the-- no.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   Anyway.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   Okay.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   So, no, social web food camp, it started out more as developers and engineers.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   And I think with social media, they brought us all together.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   So, it wasn't just the engineers and the developers.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   It was journalists and content creators.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   You know what was there?
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   It was interesting was the director of citizen participation for the Obama White House.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   Oh my gosh, did a whole thing on what they're trying to do with social media.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   And it's amazing to see--
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   What are they trying to do?
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   I mean, the thing is--
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   Did you have any--
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   They created a great--
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   They created a great community during the election.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   A Greek?
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   A great community.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   It's the--
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   It's the Pino speaking.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   Don't blame her.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   This is good Pino.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   I'm like this.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   Yeah, it's good Pino.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   It's the heat.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   It's my cold.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   So, but it's about--
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   You don't have a cold to you.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   Let's talk about--
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   Come, she doesn't have a pop screen.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   She doesn't need a pop screen.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   She's a trained professional.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   He does Lisa Betnay.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   She's you and me, the old man.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   I'm like getting a text from here.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   Hey.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   I have to keep us from drooling.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   You have to know what I'm going to do about it.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   That's not a pop screen.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   It's a drool.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   It's a catch.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   What are we going to tell you about the government and what they're doing on the line?
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   Please do.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   Thank you.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   Okay, guys.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   So, during the election, we know they created a community, they established it, but it was
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   all really all of us that maintained that.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   But now it's like now that he's elected, like what do they do?
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   And it's crazy because the government--
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   But seriously, I think we raised a good question, which is, is it all just about getting reelected?
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   Is it really about democracy?
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   Is he really--
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   Are they listening?
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   Are they all of us?
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   The fact--
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   Or is it just about getting people to say, yeah, yeah, yeah, well--
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   And then just keep begging for more money.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   Well, that's what I do.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   What's wrong with that, John?
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   That's the faces of this business.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   Yeah, but he's already got the things that--
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   Well, wait a second.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   To implement the things he wants to implement, he needs all of us backing him, so it's about
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   the amount too.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   We should say that both Lisa and Shira are Canadian nationals.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   So that gives them--
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   Zero.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   They got--
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   No, they're objective.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   They're objective.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   They have--
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   They're from Canada.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   How can that be?
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   Wait, so, to cover the problem with the government, what's going on online right now?
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   They hired the guy that used to be a Facebook.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   I don't know if you saw a fast company magazine.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   The last issue, which is pretty awesome.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   He's like 25.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   He used to be--
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   Or, no, in his 20s.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   I'm a term of his name, and it's escaping.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   I know, I just look it up online.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   Shh, cook, chum, and the chip of wine.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   Steve Chen?
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   Steve Chen?
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   You.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   So--
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   See, John is a-- is a Disturber.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   Oh, my God, you're making me like, heated up here.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   So--
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   There you go.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   Now we got it.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   Now we're getting somewhere.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   It's like 88 degrees in the studio.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   It's not here.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   It's not here.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   Very hot.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.580]   in government side, but then they have all these,
[00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:46.720]   all these other sites for other initiatives,
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:49.580]   and I feel like they need to have it under one banner,
[00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:51.520]   like one home, and then saying like--
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:54.020]   - Well, change.gov, is that the main site?
[00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:56.600]   - If that, then they have supposedly
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.620]   a cultural exchange site, and the problem is,
[00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:00.060]   when you create all these different homes,
[00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.760]   people think it's just random people creating them,
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:04.080]   and they're just really bad websites,
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:06.220]   whereas they're like, oh, it's the government site,
[00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:07.960]   and we realize they're trying to do outreach,
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.060]   and you respected it more.
[00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:12.120]   But instead, they create these independent homes
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:13.700]   where you just feel like they're random sites
[00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.800]   being created by random people,
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.640]   and you don't end up engaging them.
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.000]   - The government's always had that problem, though,
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.360]   with this kind of fragmentation.
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:22.680]   So she's saying this is my job, is to pull it all together.
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.440]   - Well, she's not saying that, she was like, help me,
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:28.000]   and then I was like, why don't you have one big hub for it all?
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.440]   - Well, they have a CTO now.
[00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:35.520]   There is an official CTO, and I care.
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.400]   - Yeah, it's a guy from Virginia.
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:40.160]   - He was the Virginia's chief of technology.
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.960]   - Something Chopra.
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:42.800]   - Yeah.
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.240]   - And did she talk about him at all?
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.160]   I mean, that was just announced.
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.520]   - But they need an engineer, there's no money,
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:48.760]   they need people to help.
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.080]   - So they're asking the community,
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.560]   they're asking the social web community
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:52.400]   to pitch in. - Yeah, it's like,
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.720]   how do we get the word out to get people involved?
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.600]   - Well, you go to recovery.gov, I guess,
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.600]   is one of their key sites.
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.280]   - That's the problem, John, it's recovery.gov,
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.000]   change.gov, it's everything, right?
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:01.840]   - It's too many.
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:02.680]   - It's too many.
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.440]   - And nobody goes to any of them, let's face it.
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:06.680]   - Well, you know, it was--
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:07.520]   - It was a good problem.
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:08.840]   - And then the other problem is,
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:13.840]   look, I got the tool website for God.
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.840]   - And then the other thing is,
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:16.840]   I think it's a good problem.
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:17.840]   - And then the other thing is,
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:18.840]   I think it's a good problem.
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:19.840]   - And then the other thing is,
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:20.840]   I think it's a good problem.
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:21.840]   - And then the other thing is,
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:22.840]   I think it's a good problem.
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:23.840]   - And then the other thing is,
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:24.840]   I think it's a good problem.
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:25.840]   - And then the other thing is,
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:26.840]   I think it's a good problem.
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:27.840]   - And then the other thing is,
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:28.840]   I think it's a good problem.
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:29.840]   - And then the other thing is,
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:30.840]   I think it's a good problem.
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:31.840]   - And then the other thing is,
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:32.840]   I think it's a good problem.
[00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:33.840]   - And then the other thing is,
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:34.840]   I think it's a good problem.
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:35.840]   - And then the other thing is,
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:36.840]   I think it's a good problem.
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:37.840]   - And then the other thing is,
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:38.840]   pot is legal.
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:39.840]   You go smoke.
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:41.840]   Everybody, you thought it was cheating.
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:43.840]   - And now let's talk about the other stuff.
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:44.840]   - Yeah, really.
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:46.840]   It's not Barack, it's Cheech.
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:47.840]   - I think this is the problem.
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:49.840]   - Is that your Brock voice or definitely?
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:50.840]   - That was my Cheech.
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:51.840]   - I don't think she's that sick as well.
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:52.840]   - It's not bad.
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:54.840]   - I think social media is kind of run amok.
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:56.840]   - Clearly this show, it's run amok.
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:57.840]   - She's kind of like the naysayer today.
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:58.840]   - No, you know, she's like that.
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:18:59.840]   - I am.
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.840]   - She brings us all the reality.
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:02.840]   - Focus in.
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:03.840]   - She's a buzzkill.
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:04.840]   - Sorry.
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:05.840]   - Come on.
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:13.400]   - I just think that, I mean, just in my own stuff, like, fragmenting everything has just
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:16.640]   pulled me away from what's actually important.
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:21.560]   I think that can be said about anything when you don't have a strong core and everything
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:22.560]   sort of like.
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:26.800]   - I do have to say, using all the Twitter and all the Efrenfi and stuff, I'm starting
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.800]   to feel a little bit scattered.
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:29.800]   - Scattered.
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:30.800]   - Yeah.
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:31.800]   Do we all feel that way?
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.440]   - No, because I don't do half of this stuff.
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.240]   I focus on, I use Twitter.
[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:37.240]   I do my blog and I do these podcasts.
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:38.240]   - Give it time.
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:40.240]   You will become more ADD over time.
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.240]   - No, it's not going to happen.
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:44.560]   I've already, I just can't, I don't have enough hours in the day.
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:49.800]   - Sure, you know, if your website were running on Squarespace, I don't think you'd be having
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:51.360]   these problems.
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:54.920]   Shira, you got to try Squarespace.
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:59.720]   Shira is a, you know, a perfect example.
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:05.080]   Whenever you run a website, you assume a certain amount of traffic.
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:08.760]   But what if all of a sudden you get wildly successful?
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:11.840]   What if your blog gets dug or slashed out?
[00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.560]   What if we mention it on Twit Live?
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:19.480]   What if, you know, you suddenly are a star?
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.200]   Then how does your website respond?
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:24.040]   If it's squarespace.com, no problem.
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.040]   No problem.
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:29.920]   Squarespace uses an amazing cloud-based architecture for speed and stability.
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:32.160]   You don't host it, they do.
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:36.120]   You're using some very sophisticated Java implementations and some virtual servers that
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:39.120]   allow them to throw bandwidth online with a flip of a switch.
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.840]   They never run out.
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:41.840]   So you never run out.
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:45.000]   So you're going to love Squarespace for a lot of reasons.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.720]   It's easy to design a site.
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:50.840]   Their Ajax allows you to kind of drag and drop your design.
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:52.680]   Great templates to start with.
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:57.280]   Easy import for WordPress, Blogger, Moveable Type and TypePad and Export 2.
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:00.560]   If you decide you want to leave, you're not going to want to though.
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:01.560]   There's a forum.
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:02.560]   There's a photo gallery.
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:03.560]   There's form builders.
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:04.640]   There's Google Maps search engine.
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:07.960]   Optimize them on and on and on.
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:10.160]   I use discuss as my comment system.
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.600]   Although they have a very good comment system themselves, I'm just tired to discuss.
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:13.600]   It was easy.
[00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:16.760]   Just a couple of lines and boom, I've got it.
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:17.760]   Squarespace.
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:21.200]   It's the modern way to blog, to have a website.
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.960]   Optimize for beginners and experts.
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:28.440]   If you know CSS, you could tweak to your heart's content.
[00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:29.840]   But this is an example.
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:33.360]   If you don't have a web person, now you've got a web person.
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.360]   Squarespace.com.
[00:21:35.360 --> 00:21:37.560]   Let them be your web person.

[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:39.560]   Absolutely free.

[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:42.480]   No credit card, no sign up, nothing.
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:47.240]   You just go, well, you create a login, but you don't have to give them any other information.
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.400]   Squarespace.com/twit.
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:49.400]   You could set up a site.
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:51.400]   You get two weeks to really play with it.
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:52.400]   Get a sense of it.
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.840]   If you decide to stick around, use Twit as the coupon code.
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:57.520]   You'll save 10%.
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:00.120]   I have been so impressed with Anthony and the gang.
[00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:03.680]   Dane, everybody over at Squarespace, they know their stuff.
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.280]   They're gung ho.
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:09.200]   They want to do the best damn website in the world and they've done it.
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.640]   This is the best hosting everywhere, anywhere.
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:12.640]   I just love them.
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.560]   I want you to try it right now.
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:15.960]   Squarespace.com/twit.
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:19.840]   Now you got web people.
[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:22.720]   So Lisa, you share my kind of feeling that this is-
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:23.720]   I do.
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:24.720]   I do.
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:30.520]   Yeah, recently Twitter is not making me as happy as it was.
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:31.520]   Okay.
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:32.520]   I don't know if celebrities came in.
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:34.800]   Let's talk about the big story Ashton Kutcher.
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:35.800]   It's the- I'm like-
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.080]   Ashton is the elephant in the room.
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:39.640]   We might as well admit it.
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:40.640]   What do you- how do you feel about it?
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:41.920]   Oh, we're not going to talk about Twitter.
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:43.840]   I promise that I would make a statement.
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:47.440]   It's the single biggest story of the week.
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:48.440]   Yeah, we need to.
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.440]   Oprah is on Twitter.
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:50.840]   I want to get him on.
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:52.400]   This guy.
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:53.400]   Get who on?
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:54.400]   James.
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:55.400]   Colin, did you just send him the-
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:56.400]   I did.
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:58.280]   I DM'd him, but he's on the road, so I don't know if he got it.
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:01.040]   Duddy links Laura Grades to Facebook to me is a bigger story.
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.680]   All right, let's talk about it.
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:03.680]   I got it right here.
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:06.760]   It's from K-State Collegian.
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:09.360]   By the way, fans out there, you can thank me.
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:11.520]   Oh, you're just egging them on.
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:15.480]   You just want me to get more mail from people saying, "Oh, this Twitter's got to stop."
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:16.480]   It was a big story.
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.920]   You can't deny it was a big story this week.
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:19.320]   I deny it.
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.480]   So what- all right.
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.880]   Oh, you're going on topic again.
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:26.120]   I'm sorry, but I just want to know what you think, because you are-
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:27.120]   Thank you.
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:28.120]   I think it stinks.
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:32.800]   All right, so that's exactly- I just want- because I also felt like it was a bit narcissistic.
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:36.160]   I mean, you actually- Here we go.
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:37.160]   I tried.
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:38.160]   You actually know him.
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.160]   I tried.
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:44.640]   I've been on- I've worked with Ashton, and I think he's done a lot of fun, great stuff,
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:46.920]   and brought the mainstream community to tech.
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:48.240]   Do you- do tech people want that?
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:50.520]   I'm not really sure about that.
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:54.400]   That's what kind of cracks me up is it does look a little bit like the tech people are
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.400]   going.
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:24:00.720]   It's the same feeling that when- remember when AOL added Internet access, and all of
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:04.400]   a sudden all these people who had been locked- locked in this walled garden at AOL were
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:06.120]   suddenly on the Internet.
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:07.920]   And it was the- they called it the Summer of AOL.
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:09.920]   I can't remember what year it was, my '95 or '96.
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:17.760]   It was a big deal because all of these exclusive snobby elitists who had it to themselves,
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:22.280]   we all have Twitter to ourselves, and all of a sudden, oh my God, Oprah's using Twitter.
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:23.280]   It feels a little bit like that.
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:27.640]   It's really pretty much your attitude.
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:31.480]   I for one welcome are mainstream media overlords.
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:35.000]   Do you feel like they should sell now because it's like-
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   That's the time.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.760]   Okay, now I've got to try strategy two to get us back on a real topic.
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:40.760]   We're going to get to the studies.
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:41.760]   All right, let's go.
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.680]   Now we're going to get to that, but I think this is- I'm sorry.
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:44.680]   This is a real topic.
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:45.680]   It is a real topic.
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:46.680]   It is a real topic.
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:49.040]   It is a real topic in any way, shape, or form.
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.440]   It's just the biggest story of the world.
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:51.440]   Here's one reason.
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.320]   Oprah got- she just opened up an account.
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:55.360]   She got 256,000 instantly.
[00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:58.600]   When Oprah shows up on television, she has tens of millions.
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:24:59.600]   There you go.
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:00.600]   That's a story.
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.600]   Then it's a fraction of her two ways that's trying to come to nothing.
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:05.640]   It just- it just- it just really shows how many people in the world are using Twitter,
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:07.760]   meaning Twitter is selling a micro-
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:08.760]   Not that many.
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:11.280]   What it is about Twitter that generates so much conversation, that's what I like to
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:12.280]   know.
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:16.440]   I think it's a functional, good thing to use and for whatever- for a lot of different
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:21.960]   reasons, but exactly why it creates so much of this, you know, this gazing at your own
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:22.960]   naval kind of-
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:23.960]   It is a lot of that.
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:24.960]   ... conversation about it.
[00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:25.960]   Why you not?
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:26.960]   It's not what blogs are.
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:27.960]   Well, life casts a lot of-
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:32.720]   It was the last time you talked about blogs, the way you talk about Twitter.
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:33.720]   I do.
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:36.360]   I tell people I blog- I think the art of blogging is-
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:37.360]   I think the art of blogging is that-
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:38.360]   Is it?
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:39.360]   Well, the-
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:40.360]   What kills blogging?
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:41.360]   Twitter?
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:42.360]   There she goes again.
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:43.360]   She's better than me at this.
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.360]   She's always like that.
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:45.360]   She's always like the devil's advocate.
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:46.360]   I think it's great, actually.
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:47.360]   I'm going to go on the corner.
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:49.920]   I'm going to go kill myself.
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.320]   Dvorak's dead.
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.680]   Lisa Bettany is now the new Dvorak.
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:26:00.520]   Yeah, I feel a bit beaten down, I guess, lately, and- because my blog was my thing.
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:01.520]   You loved your blog.
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:02.520]   Like, I came-
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:05.200]   She changed the design and that's what changed her.
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.640]   She took the cute girl pictures off.
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.480]   But I didn't want to be the cute girl.
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:09.480]   I agree.
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:10.480]   I think-
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:11.480]   What do you mean you agree?
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:12.480]   Nobody else does.
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:13.480]   I know.
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.480]   I was the one who told her to do it.
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:15.320]   I feel bad.
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:17.320]   How safe to tell people what happened because I don't-
[00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:21.720]   Well, I mean, I- like, I have a master's degree in linguistics.
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:26.080]   Like, I don't come from this background at all, but I love tech and I love- I love new
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:29.040]   media and I just said, "I'm just going to start a blog."
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:33.320]   And I started a blog and, you know, all of a sudden I got recognition and I got to a
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:37.440]   position where I could be on these shows and meet these people and it was inspiring and
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:41.160]   it was great and- and my blog was sort of thriving.
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:46.680]   And then sort of the negative stuff came, the trolls came and-
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:47.680]   Oh, come on.
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:48.680]   How much-
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:49.680]   You know, this-
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:50.680]   Negative stuff.
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:51.680]   I think it's- we take ourselves too seriously.
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:53.680]   I do want to talk about trolls though because I think trolls-
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:56.320]   What makes- can we do one or two news stories in first so we-
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:57.320]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:58.320]   Listen to you.
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:26:59.960]   Here's two conflicting news stories.
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:00.960]   You picked one.
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:01.960]   All right, so let's try it.
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:06.600]   Which was a Kansas State study that says that- and by the way, even the people who did
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:10.840]   the study say, "We can't say that the use of Facebook leads to lower grades unless
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:11.840]   studying."
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:13.520]   But we did find a relationship.
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:17.440]   They surveyed Kansas State students, not a huge survey, 209 students.
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:19.040]   I'm sorry, Ohio State.
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:21.400]   Ohio State, yeah, not Kansas State.
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:24.600]   Including 102 undergraduates and 117 graduate students.
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:30.360]   85% of undergrad, 52% of grad students had a Facebook account survey said, "Undergraduates
[00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:35.920]   using Facebook have GPAs an average of one half to one point lower than non-users."
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:36.920]   Now that's not causality.
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:38.480]   What about the educators or the teachers?
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:40.720]   Are they having anything to do with this?
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.720]   Time dedicated to studying was also reduced.
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:43.720]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:46.720]   What about the grand or bigger picture of this?
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:47.720]   It's like-
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:48.720]   You're a Facebook defender too.
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:50.720]   Well, of course you're a-
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:51.720]   Dave Moran's friend.
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:56.000]   I just feel like she was a friend of a variety, so she has to say whatever they told her.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.480]   She was bunking with Dave Moran this week.
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:00.280]   I was in an RV with the Facebook crowd.
[00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:01.280]   No, I was also-
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:03.080]   Well, there's a joke there somewhere.
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:04.080]   I'm not going to go there.
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.720]   Anyway, the fact is I feel like you always, it's like cell phones.
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:07.720]   Everything causes cancer.
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:08.720]   Blah, blah, blah.
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:09.720]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:11.720]   The correlation does not prove causality and-
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.720]   So you're in denial.
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:14.720]   I just love life.
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:15.720]   I always look for the-
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:16.720]   I like Facebook.
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:17.720]   I love wife or something.
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:18.720]   I love getting-
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:20.720]   No, but I just think that we have to look at the bigger picture.
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:21.720]   But get ready for this.
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:22.720]   Okay.
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:23.720]   Study two.
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:28.480]   Teenagers who don't get their daily fix of daily networking sites are prone to becoming
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:31.040]   stressed and short-tempered.
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:32.040]   That's true.
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:33.040]   That's true.
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:38.160]   The study by Yahoo showed that a third of 16 to 24-year-olds who did not have access-
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:43.600]   Now, just ask yourself kids, kids who are listening right now, if you did not have access to Facebook
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:46.120]   Bibo MySpace, how would you feel?
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:48.040]   Would you suffer from more anxiety?
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:49.720]   Would you have more emotional strength?
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:54.840]   71% of participants say they felt cut off from daily life.
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:29:00.480]   70% said they felt unable to manage a balanced lifestyle without Facebook.
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:01.480]   Wow.
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.280]   What do you think?
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:04.280]   Sick.
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:05.280]   Yeah.
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:08.120]   I think these people should go seek counseling.
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:10.120]   Welcome to the NIH, my friends.
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:12.760]   They have to go cold turkey.
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:15.440]   I would get a little stressed if I couldn't put it.
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:18.040]   I mean, there's so much else to do.
[00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:19.040]   Maybe a big one.
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:22.200]   I would feel that way if I was cut off from the internet.
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.200]   Okay.
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:24.200]   That's my most newer source.
[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:27.720]   And you're an adult like a you engage.
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.960]   You're like not a first person adaptor.
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:30.960]   What's it called?
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:31.960]   Early adaptor.
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:32.960]   Early adaptor.
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:33.960]   Adoptor.
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:34.960]   I mean-
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:35.960]   No, no, no, you know what the thing is.
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:36.960]   So maybe-
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.240]   I mean, I think that them is Facebook MySpace.
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.240]   That's the thing.
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:42.440]   So you have a broader internet experience.
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:43.440]   So what you're saying is-
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:44.440]   I hate you.
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:45.440]   Nice pour by the way.
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:46.440]   That's very well done.
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:47.440]   I hate you, I'm not.
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:48.440]   I'm just really hot.
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:49.440]   I'm really hot.
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.440]   You know, I'm hot too.
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:51.440]   Let's just down these.
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:52.440]   Right.
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:53.440]   So I just want to say, but I-
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:54.440]   Right.
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:56.280]   There is a certain sense like yesterday I lost my phone and I'm like, I'm a bit freaking
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:57.280]   out.
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:58.600]   But the fact is we should be able to live without the stuff.
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:02.160]   We should be able to take time out over a weekend and be disconnected.
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:03.160]   How did that feel though?
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:05.120]   You were actually very connected because you were at social media.
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:09.640]   Yeah, I felt like weird being and I also lost my N95 on Friday, which I do on my video
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:10.640]   blogging from.
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:11.640]   I can't find it.
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:12.640]   And yeah, there's-
[00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:13.840]   You lost your phone and you're N95?
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:16.840]   Well, I found my blackberry, but the N95 I can't find.
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:20.520]   But there is a sense of feeling a need to keep up and I think that's the stress right
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:21.520]   now as someone-
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:22.720]   The things will pass you by.
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:26.800]   Things will pass you by and then you're nonexistent if you don't update.
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:27.800]   So you lose-
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:28.800]   See, I think we got to the root of it here.
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:29.800]   I think that's exactly right.
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:30.800]   But do you feel-
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:33.920]   We define ourselves via the internet, via our presence online.
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:39.040]   But do you feel like- I mean, you have the mix of actual sort of mainstream stuff where
[00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:42.800]   you're creating content and doing that kind of thing.
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:49.520]   And I mean, there's something a little bit hollow about talking about yourself.
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:52.520]   As opposed to creating something original.
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:55.640]   I have something to say about that and I think the people that will survive through
[00:30:55.640 --> 00:31:00.320]   this in terms of not just being like an ego blogger and all that, or the people that do
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:04.480]   the PR, do the buzz and show a bit of their life, but you always need to balance that
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:06.200]   out with content.
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:08.280]   And I try to step back a lot.
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:09.280]   I agree.
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:10.280]   With what I do.
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:11.280]   I don't know what you think-
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:12.280]   You know what?
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:17.680]   I've worked in TV for a long time in real media for a long time.
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:21.040]   And one of the things that I always told the young people that are coming to me and starting
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:23.040]   out their careers, and this was Kevin Rose.
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:25.160]   This was a lot of people-
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:26.400]   The people you've mentored.
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:27.400]   The people I've mentored.
[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:28.400]   And one of the first things I said to them is-
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:30.400]   The first thing you notice, they never give you any stock.
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:31.400]   I don't care.
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:32.400]   I don't want stock.
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:36.400]   I just want the respect and love of the people who follow in my footsteps.
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:38.400]   I can't find any of the chat rooms that hit you on TV.
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.400]   Really?
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:40.400]   IRC.Twit.tv.
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:41.400]   They don't want you on there.
[00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:42.400]   Or Facebook.
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:44.720]   There's a Twitter conversation from there too.
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:48.720]   But what I always tell them is, and I think that this is the only way to survive that
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:54.080]   shallow deep trench that is television, is do not focus on chasing the audience, do
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:58.840]   not focus on your care or your good looks, do not focus-
[00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:00.880]   Well that's no problem with me.
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:01.880]   Yeah.
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:03.400]   Well look at me and Patrick.
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:05.480]   Obviously we weren't focusing on that.
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:09.200]   What I said is you focus on serving your audience, given your-
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.160]   Every moment serving your audience.
[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:14.680]   So think about ratings, don't think about anything but serving the audience and all
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:16.200]   the rest follows from that.
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:18.240]   If you give them content and it's-
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:20.680]   You know what Sage, I learned this from acting.
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:24.480]   I'm trying to remember the wonderful acting book that I read.
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:28.680]   She said, "Any good actor comes not from ego, not from-
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:34.400]   Comes from something deep belief, deeply held beliefs that they are trying to, you know,
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:36.680]   their core values that are trying to express.
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:40.040]   And I think it's the same in any performing art, in television, radio, media, and new
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:45.080]   media, they're all performing arts that it has to come from core values and the desire
[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:46.440]   to serve the audience.
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:49.080]   And if you do that then you don't get eaten alive by all this stuff.
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:51.200]   Yeah, I think that's really important to you.
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:56.520]   I mean, and that's what happened to me is, you know, I received a bit of, you know,
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:59.280]   attention and then I started pandering.
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:00.280]   Yes!
[00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:01.280]   I knew the-
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:02.280]   It's very hard not to.
[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:06.440]   And this is- I especially tell us the young ladies like Morgan Webb who that's very tempting
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:07.880]   because they're all- they're all listening.
[00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:10.840]   You're so pretty, you're so gorgeous and you start to say, "Yeah."
[00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:15.680]   It wasn't so much in that but I knew what topics they wanted to talk about.
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:17.280]   I just had to guide them to-
[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:18.280]   I'm just going to chase the audience.
[00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:21.480]   I mean, we're completely rebelling here over the previous-
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:24.080]   No, she chased the audience and that's what everybody wants to do.
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:25.080]   Oh, she's-
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:29.280]   But if the balance was you chasing the audience and creating engagement, so creating like-
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:30.280]   It's like when you invite friends into this-
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:31.280]   But it can't be phony engagement.
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.280]   No, it can't be-
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:33.280]   How do I-
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:34.280]   How do I-
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:36.080]   How do I tune myself so that they'll like me better?
[00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:37.080]   It has to be-
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:38.080]   Yes.
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:40.080]   This is what I have to say, this is what I have to give and I'm going to give it to you
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.280]   and I'm going to give it to you the best way I can.
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:45.280]   And if you don't like it, okay, I'm maybe not famous and successful but I'm going to
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:46.280]   speak with my honest voice.
[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:50.680]   That's the difference between you and me, Leo, because I respect the audience.
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:51.680]   I have never-
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:53.000]   I don't try to get confrontational.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   I do what they want.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   I'm the nicest.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   That's why I'm-
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   That's such a bull-
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   That's all over us.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.080]   Actually, what you want to do, you want to give the audience exactly what they want.
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:01.080]   You don't want to be contrarian.
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.400]   But you can create the need.
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.280]   You can also create the need, right?
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:08.480]   John is being sarcastic because he's the most contrarian columnist out there.
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:10.080]   But John, I have to say something.
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:11.080]   I do have to say something.
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:12.080]   I got her.
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:13.080]   You fooled Donna.
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:14.560]   She was junk jumping in on it.
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:17.720]   But I do have to say that in a way, though, you're paying attention to the audience because
[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:18.720]   you're pushing their buttons.
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:20.720]   You intentionally push their buttons.
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:23.720]   So you are manipulative, like communicator?
[00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:24.720]   Yeah.
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:25.720]   No.
[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:26.720]   You like to push those buttons.
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:27.720]   Not in fact, in the least.
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:30.760]   I'm probably one of the most honest and sincere people that you'll ever meet.
[00:34:30.760 --> 00:34:31.760]   I think that's what it's about.
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:32.760]   That may be true.
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:33.760]   You know, I actually would give John that.
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:35.840]   I will give you that.
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:38.680]   Not in the way that you mean, but I think I would give you that.
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:39.680]   You're honest.
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:41.520]   You don't give a fig-
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:42.520]   As it were.
[00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:43.520]   What people-
[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:44.520]   Keeping it a family show.
[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:45.520]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:46.520]   I think ultimately-
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:48.520]   Well, actually, I'm going to interrupt you.
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:51.160]   Actually, what he brought up is something that Lisa brought up and I'm going to wrap
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:52.160]   it around.
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:53.160]   Yeah.
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:56.840]   Which is the thing about getting over the fact, especially with new media, that people
[00:34:56.840 --> 00:35:00.040]   are going to come on and call you a jerk and an idiot and just talk.
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:01.040]   Right.
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:02.040]   Because you're going to do that.
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:06.760]   And the only way that you then you actually will feed them if you try to, you know, take
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:10.200]   them on, although there's other ways of doing it, especially if you're the moderator,
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:13.120]   you can just change what they say and make them look like idiots, which is what we like
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:14.120]   to do.
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:16.480]   But, you know, it's unfair.
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:20.440]   But generally speaking, you have to get used because of the nature of the business being.
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:24.000]   Now it's the audience is bigger than whatever the publication is.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   And so there-
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   We give them power.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.240]   They're getting way more power than they're used to having.
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:29.400]   You got to get used to the fact you're going to get a lot of abuse.
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:30.400]   Yeah.
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:31.400]   But how do you deal with that, Lisa?
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:32.400]   I could tell it hurts you.
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:33.400]   Well, it did.
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:34.800]   And that's why I started pandering.
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:38.440]   Because I was very sarcastic and very-
[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:44.080]   And my first article in the province, I took on Press Hilton and just said how he
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:49.000]   was giving bloggers a bad name because he's just producing this kind of trash.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.320]   But people love it.
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:53.840]   And I just received so much hate mail from it.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:55.360]   You backed off.
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:57.200]   And then I said, "Okay, I'll just be nice."
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:02.400]   And you know from my previous experiences coming on this show that I've played that-
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.400]   No more nice Lisa.
[00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:06.160]   I think it's about being engaged and creating a conversation.
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:07.240]   That's what this is all about.
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:12.200]   All these tools we've created and have been given to us are to create a conversation and
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:14.800]   worldwide communication and a global community.
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.600]   And I think it's awesome.
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:18.320]   Like it's like you're at a dinner table.
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:20.320]   And when it's stuck, we thought the same way.
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:22.120]   Probably with a bunch of other people, right?
[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:24.960]   It's a dinner that we won't get invited to, me and Leo.
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:25.960]   Not now.
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:26.960]   We won't.
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.440]   We're going to be anyway.
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:29.440]   Your mind's going to burn the breath.
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:31.360]   I look at it as I love meeting people.
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:32.920]   I love having conversation.
[00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:34.440]   And this is just through what I do.
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:36.360]   I can have a global conversation.
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:37.360]   Sure.
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:38.360]   Have you ever had trolls?
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:39.360]   Have you ever had negative comments?
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.360]   Have you ever had-
[00:36:40.360 --> 00:36:41.360]   Yeah, I do.
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:43.960]   Do you know all the crap that Lisa got for a long time?
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:44.960]   Why did you get-
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:45.960]   I don't get-
[00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:51.040]   See, it's hard for me because I watch people like, well, I haven't seen it like possibly
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:53.440]   you and then there's Julie Allison and some people.
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:54.440]   Julie gets a lot of crap.
[00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:55.440]   There's some women out there.
[00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:58.280]   Julie is stalked by bloggers on Tumblr.
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:01.560]   For me, I look and I'm like, how do I not go there?
[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:02.560]   Or like, I don't know.
[00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:04.080]   It's like, how do you navigate that?
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:07.880]   I'm not sure because I thankfully haven't really gotten that.
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:09.560]   And I don't know why you haven't.
[00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:10.560]   You will.
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:12.640]   You have to do in this show.
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:14.800]   Maybe they think you're a nice person and they don't-
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:15.800]   I think ultimately-
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.360]   Or at least as a nice person.
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:18.600]   Nobody thought you weren't a nice person.
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:19.600]   There's always haters.
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:22.800]   No, this is- I have people like, why did you say that?
[00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:28.160]   So, Lisa, your way of dealing with this was to say, oh, I'm not gonna stir that and
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:29.560]   horn its nest again.
[00:37:29.560 --> 00:37:35.400]   Yeah, I mean, I backed off a little and then I saw David Copperfield.
[00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:36.400]   The magician-
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:37.400]   The magician?
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:39.840]   And I just nailed him again.
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:41.840]   You beat up on David Copperfield?
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:44.160]   You did that on a couple of things I've seen.
[00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.160]   Yes.
[00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:46.160]   Now, is this the real Lisa?
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:47.160]   That's the real Lisa.
[00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:52.120]   Well, yeah, I have my opinions and I'm sarcastic and I have a dry sense of humor and-
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:54.360]   But Canadians are very nice.
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:55.360]   Canadians are very-
[00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:56.360]   I don't know about-
[00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:57.360]   Canadians are very quite-
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:59.040]   They have more comedians from Canada than any place.
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:00.800]   And singers and artists and I mean, can I-
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:01.800]   Canada's a-
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:02.800]   But ultimately-
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:03.800]   Miracle.
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:04.800]   Yeah.
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:05.800]   It's a little miracle to our north.
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:09.480]   On my blog, I sort of had this where I wanted to teach people photography and want to
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:11.040]   talk about photography.
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:15.800]   But then I also wanted to write these snarky posts and they just don't-
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:16.800]   Yeah, I-
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:17.800]   There were two Lisa's two-
[00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:19.540]   Well, really, I do everything-
[00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:20.540]   No, wait a second.
[00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:21.540]   I don't believe in that.
[00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:23.520]   I don't believe in that because I think your brand is you.
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:24.520]   And I think that-
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:28.080]   That means some days you might be informative and talk about things that are relevant and
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:31.720]   what you're doing professionally and some days that might mean like you just want to
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:32.720]   talk about life.
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:37.360]   And I feel like the ultimate like, oh, if you look at brands like Oprah, I mean, she
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:38.360]   does it a bit of both.
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:39.360]   And I think those are the ultimate brands-
[00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:40.360]   Yeah, but she has plenty of outlets.
[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:41.360]   She doesn't stick the wine outlet.
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:44.160]   She's got a magazine, a TV show.
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:46.360]   I mean, you know, she's got several TV shows.
[00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:48.360]   She's got a bunch of stuff, she produces other people's stuff.
[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:49.440]   She's got reality show blogs, that's the thing.
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:56.280]   So what do you think, like niche versus just creating a brand of perspective almost?
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:57.280]   You have to do the branding.
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:59.640]   And like, your voice, which means it's not necessarily-
[00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:02.720]   I mean, it doesn't mean you're talking about cats one day and talking about looking at
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:03.720]   all the next.
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:04.720]   I don't think that you have to.
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:05.720]   No, Lisa did.
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:06.720]   But sometimes that's what-
[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:08.720]   That was looking at Twitter.
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:11.360]   Twitter's allowed you to go there and that's what's created the engagement.
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:13.360]   That's exactly what Twitter does.
[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:14.360]   Oh, here we go.
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:15.360]   Twitter alert.
[00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:16.360]   Twitter alert.
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:17.360]   Twitter alert.
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:18.360]   Oh, come on, John.
[00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:21.040]   I'm telling you, everybody wants me to do this and that's why I'm here.
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:22.040]   We're not pandering.
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:24.480]   I bet you I won't even be on the show next week because of my attitude.
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:26.240]   We're not pandering, are we?
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:27.240]   I'm going to get all-
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:28.480]   Everybody wants me to do this.
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:29.480]   All right.
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:30.480]   Let me do it, my-
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:32.200]   Lisa, please.
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:36.600]   So your reaction after you pandered for a little while, you changed yourself.
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:40.080]   What changed your mind about that?
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.080]   Just how it felt.
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:42.080]   It wasn't you.
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:43.160]   It wasn't me.
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:47.480]   And I couldn't- like when I guess the big thing was when I started to come on these
[00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:51.640]   live shows and I couldn't maintain that persona.
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:52.640]   You can't, can you?
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:54.440]   That's perfect because I wanted to be perfect.
[00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:55.440]   No, you can't.
[00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:56.440]   Just this.
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:57.440]   Live is wonderful.
[00:39:57.440 --> 00:40:01.520]   Live TV is wonderful for that because ultimately you- or in radio, I learned this in radio after
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:02.680]   30 years.
[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:06.640]   If you can't lie forever, you have to ultimately become yourself.
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:08.400]   And that's what all people want is your authentic.
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.840]   Well, everyone's through Miles Davis story.
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:14.560]   So before I just bring that up though, how come I can't get on this thing?
[00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:15.560]   Are you having trouble again?
[00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:16.560]   I just talked to it.tv.
[00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:19.200]   Yeah, and it gives me this chooser nickname password.
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:20.200]   Choosing nickname.
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:23.320]   It says Connect and it says Closing Link, Registration Timeout.
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:24.320]   Oh my god.
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:25.320]   Just do it faster.
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:26.320]   There's too many people in there as you're probably not-
[00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:28.640]   My webmaster said that my site's down.
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:29.640]   And we open 30 minutes.
[00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:31.760]   Oh, you have no personality now and you have no brand.
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:32.760]   I have nothing.
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:33.760]   Nothing.
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:34.760]   You know what it is, John?
[00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:37.040]   There's probably so many people in chat you can't get in there.
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:38.400]   Somebody leave now, immediately.
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:41.200]   All right, there were some other big stories.
[00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:42.200]   In fact, a huge story-
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:43.200]   Same thing.
[00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:46.120]   Pirate Bay, the court trial-
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:47.120]   That was crazy.
[00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:52.220]   ... concluded with one-year present sentences handed down by a Swedish judge of fine of 2.4
[00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:53.220]   million pounds.
[00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:55.440]   That's 3.6 million dollars.
[00:40:55.440 --> 00:41:01.720]   The defendants- Pirate Bay co-founders Frederick Neal- Gottfried Zwarp Hallmour.
[00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:02.720]   Warg.
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:05.400]   And Peter Sunda-Kornman-Sop-Sop-Sop-E.
[00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:07.920]   So far, isn't it?
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:15.680]   Said, "The judgment was weird and bizarre, and they insist that they cannot pay and will
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:16.680]   not pay."
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:19.400]   They got no money.
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:20.400]   They got no money.
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:25.800]   A press conference held after the Stockholm court found the four defendants guilty.
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:31.640]   Peter Sunda-Kornman-Sop-E held up a handwritten IOU to the camera and said, "That is a
[00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:34.880]   close as they are going to get from me.
[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:37.680]   Even if I had any money, I would rather- I don't know what exit that is."
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:38.680]   This is pretty good, though.
[00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:39.680]   I like it.
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:40.680]   I'm trying not to do the-
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:41.680]   You can't do it all apart with it.
[00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:46.640]   I'm trying not to do the typical Swedish chef thing, okay?
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:47.640]   Even if I had any money, I would rather-
[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:49.640]   You know how much it works.
[00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:52.960]   I would rather burn everything I own.
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:55.520]   I'll do the little Ingrid Bergman.
[00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:59.640]   Even if I had any money, I would rather burn everything I own and not even give them the
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:00.640]   ashes.
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:03.520]   They could have the job of picking them up.
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:07.080]   That's how much I hate the media industry.
[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:08.560]   I don't know what exit that is.
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:10.400]   That's Swedish.
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:13.600]   That is Ingrid Bergman.
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:15.680]   That is the Swedish.
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:16.680]   And that's not all.
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:17.680]   Oont.
[00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:18.680]   That's true.
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:20.680]   So they're completely convinced that they're going to get off.
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:21.680]   They put on the front-
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:22.680]   No, they didn't get off.
[00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:23.680]   It's done.
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:24.680]   They're going to do well.
[00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:25.680]   You can get-
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:26.680]   There's judgment proof.
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:27.680]   Being judgment proof is what it is.
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:28.680]   They can't get the-
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:31.640]   Yeah, and they said in fact on the front page of the Pirate Bay, we're not going anywhere.
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:32.640]   We are the Internet's.
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:35.000]   Yeah, and they'll just move their operation offshore.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   They already have?
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   They did it awhile ago.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.560]   They're judgment proof that you can't get any money out of them.
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:39.560]   They're just a bunch of kids.
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:40.560]   What are you going to do?
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:44.760]   Also, once you have a focus on something that's what you've decided, you can't back
[00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:45.760]   down.
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:46.760]   It's like you're going there.
[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:47.760]   Go there.
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:49.320]   Is this something you learned at Foo Camper?
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:51.120]   No, I'm saying general, it's like a tradition.
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:52.960]   You're just throwing it in our face.
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:53.960]   Foo Camper.
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:54.960]   You're not Foo Camper.
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:55.960]   You Foo Camper.
[00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:59.880]   But it's like if you created something and that was your mission and that's what the
[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:04.280]   site does, if you back down, your users aren't going to respect you and you just-
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:05.760]   He said this is really weird.
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:07.960]   He compared it to the plot of the Karate Kid.
[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:09.960]   Of course he did.
[00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:10.960]   Of course he did.
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:13.520]   He said, oh yeah, we need some of that white wine.
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:16.080]   Probably, oh my god, in the middle of the Pirate story.
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:17.080]   I don't care.
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:20.520]   Isn't it funny that the Pirate's little Pirate actual news story happened during this?
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:21.520]   The real Pirates?
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:22.520]   Oh, that's an interesting coincidence.
[00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:23.520]   I never thought of it.
[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:25.920]   You know, the Somali Pirates were kind of angry at the pirates.
[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:28.720]   They said, they're not pirates.
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:29.720]   We are the Pirates.
[00:43:29.720 --> 00:43:31.560]   Why are they calling themselves Pirates?
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:32.560]   They are not pirates.
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:33.560]   They're from Barbados.
[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:37.200]   I don't know what it sounds like when you're from Somali.
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:38.200]   So I'm going to talk-
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:39.200]   Barbados.
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:40.200]   Barbados.
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:45.440]   No, they said they literally, they said the Somali Pirates said the Pirate Bay, that's
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:46.440]   not Pirates.
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:47.440]   We're Pirates.
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:48.440]   Yeah, well good.
[00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:51.200]   They can hang like pirates from the yard arm.
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:54.960]   Someone says every time someone says Twitter, we have to take a drink or have a-
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:55.960]   There is a Twitter drinking game.
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:57.760]   Oh, and then let's get back to the topic.
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:59.400]   Have a good hand.
[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:05.280]   So as part of the Pirate Bay story, they were saying that now this is going to push the sort
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:12.000]   of torrenting behavior onto Google so that people can now type in Google, you know, XYZ
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.480]   torrent and then find it.
[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:18.640]   I think the real point after all is that you can't stop this stuff.
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:19.480]   It's going to be happening in my room.
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:21.320]   You cannot stop this stuff.
[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:25.360]   However, these guys can go to jail and will.
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:26.360]   No.
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:27.360]   Do you think they will?
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:28.360]   No.
[00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:29.360]   They're standing there in Sweden.
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:30.360]   Aren't there computers in jail?
[00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:31.360]   Are there computers in jail?
[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:32.360]   Are there computers in jail?
[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:33.840]   Are there Swedish court convicting them?
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:35.880]   Yeah, they have a fine.
[00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:36.880]   And a year in jail.
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:37.880]   Yeah.
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:38.880]   That was the sentence.
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:39.880]   Aren't you paying attention, John?
[00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:42.480]   So the year in jail and also they can't use their laptops.
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:43.480]   They can't use their computers.
[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:44.480]   I don't know.
[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:46.640]   They might as well just take away the internet from them.
[00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:47.640]   That's jail.
[00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:48.640]   Susan Boyle.
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:49.640]   Who loves Susan Boyle?
[00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:50.640]   She's inspirational.
[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:52.840]   She's like, "What is it that whole thing is an out and out scam?"
[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:54.000]   I think it's a fake too.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   Tell me this.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   I didn't tell my wife this.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.640]   Well, because shows like that do audition.
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:44:59.640]   There's no surprise.
[00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:01.000]   And yeah, it was ridiculous.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.960]   And some of those reactions from Simon Cowell were like, "Oh, my God."
[00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:08.240]   You think anybody cut from one to the other and there's two boneheads in the back.
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:09.240]   Now the other thing-
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:10.240]   Because it's an edited show.
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:11.240]   That's true.
[00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:12.240]   They probably ISO everybody.
[00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:13.240]   You're right.
[00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:15.360]   99 recording of this woman just surfaced.
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:16.360]   Oh, it did.
[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:17.360]   Yeah.
[00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:18.360]   I twittered it.
[00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:19.360]   I said it.
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:20.360]   I'm sorry.
[00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:21.360]   I think it's a real divorce.
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:22.880]   That would be correct if you have to have a drink.
[00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:24.560]   Twitter.com/therealdevorec.
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:25.960]   Yeah.
[00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:27.200]   And you can link to it and you can hear.
[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:30.840]   She sings, I can't remember the name of the song, but she's absolutely better than her
[00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:31.840]   voices now.
[00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:32.840]   I mean, is that-
[00:45:32.840 --> 00:45:34.360]   So, she had a career singing?
[00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:35.360]   Where's this report?
[00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:37.280]   She's already a recording artist.
[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:39.480]   She looks like she could have been in a music- like she's in the music-
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:41.840]   I think they put extra makeup on.
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:43.760]   I think they beatled her eyebrows.
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:44.760]   Definitely.
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:45.920]   They dumped her down.
[00:45:45.920 --> 00:45:46.920]   Dump her.
[00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:47.920]   Dump her.
[00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:48.920]   Dump- made her dumpy.
[00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:49.920]   Dumpy.
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:54.960]   And it had her goof around, so she looked like some sort of weird frump.
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:58.720]   And there's also a recording of her local newspaper and interview with her and her
[00:45:58.720 --> 00:45:59.880]   hair is nothing like that.
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:00.880]   It's not like a clown.
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:01.880]   So they really dressed-
[00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:02.880]   They went for it.
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:03.880]   Yeah.
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:06.200]   Maybe she's- Yeah, that's part of art is dressing up like that.
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:10.480]   In this story that I link to, she's already got a record album done.
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:12.200]   She's going on Oprah.
[00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:14.720]   And she's going to sell a million copies and-
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:16.280]   And they're going to twitter it that she's on.
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:17.280]   They're going to Twitter it out.
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:18.280]   The whole thing is-
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:19.520]   This is "Crimmy River."
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:24.840]   We need to do karaoke twit karaoke.
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:32.200]   You should so do all twit karaoke.
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:37.600]   She's great.
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:39.400]   Tell me about it.
[00:46:39.400 --> 00:46:40.400]   This is her?
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:42.040]   Yeah.
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:45.040]   This is a charity CD she recorded in 1999.
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:49.040]   Yeah, she's awesome.
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:56.480]   You know why I kind of believe this because I watched her and not only did she sing technically
[00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:58.480]   well, she had a motion.
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:46:59.760]   She was like a Broadway star.
[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:00.760]   She was Sarah Brevin.
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:01.760]   She's trained.
[00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:02.760]   She was completely trained.
[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:04.400]   There was no way this came out of nowhere.
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:05.400]   Yeah, I know.
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:06.400]   Is that terrible for us to do?
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:07.600]   We're just- We're dashing people's hopes.
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:08.800]   No, we're not- Who's hopes?
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:10.320]   She's going to make a lot of money.
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:11.320]   She sings well.
[00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:12.320]   She has some revenue.
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:13.320]   No, but people- Oh, we obviously-
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:14.320]   Oh, we obviously don't know her.
[00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:15.320]   We didn't know her before.
[00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:16.320]   So she has her level of success.
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:17.320]   No, no, no.
[00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:19.960]   She's talking about her hopes by my wife.
[00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:25.120]   Yeah, you're dashing the hopes of the public that has been suckered into believing in this
[00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:26.120]   garbage.
[00:47:26.120 --> 00:47:27.120]   Well, all you have to do is google hello.
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:28.560]   It's not that hard anymore.
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:30.000]   But no, I mean, this wasn't that easy to find.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   I don't even know what you're talking about.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:32.160]   Oh, you didn't see Susan Boyle?
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:33.160]   Oh my god.
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:35.520]   25 million views on YouTube in one week.
[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:36.520]   Oh, the cable.
[00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:38.680]   No, it's not because I'm- Oh my god.
[00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:39.680]   You know the internet.
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:41.800]   The internet's are plugged up for her.
[00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:43.800]   She's turning into boyac.
[00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:44.800]   No, she's not.
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:46.360]   It's beyond me.
[00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:47.360]   She's actually getting it.
[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:49.360]   She's becoming a bitter ex-blogger.
[00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:53.240]   I don't have the internet and I don't want the internet.
[00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:54.920]   I don't ever want to see the internet.
[00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:58.200]   It was a big- You were sick last week, so you have an excuse.
[00:47:58.200 --> 00:47:59.200]   It's true.
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:01.200]   I don't know what- I have anything when you're sick.
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:02.360]   Don't you go on the internet more?
[00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:03.680]   You just had a cold?
[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:04.560]   Yes, but I-
[00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:05.560]   Zycam, my friend.
[00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:06.560]   Zycam.
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:07.760]   I want to get a bucket of this stuff.
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:08.760]   The stuff works great.
[00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:12.200]   It's about the show's not brought to you by Zycam because I would have been a great
[00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:13.200]   commercial.
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:16.640]   She just gets six people on the show.
[00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:19.440]   Beautiful colds, come on the show.
[00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:21.120]   That's a good idea.
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:23.800]   It is because when Zycam, you won't catch the cold.
[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:24.800]   Seriously.
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:29.160]   We could just like, okay, so after the wine tasting, we'll have a cold tasting.
[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:32.120]   So there's a whole bunch of jokes in that one.
[00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:33.720]   I don't want to do it.
[00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:36.280]   So she lives in Scotland.
[00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:38.000]   She says, "I've never been kissed."
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.360]   She lived with her mother.
[00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:42.840]   And it was on Britain's Got Talent.
[00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:45.280]   And Simon Cowell's a hostess, very much like American Idol.
[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:47.240]   25 million views on YouTube.
[00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:48.240]   It's in one week.
[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:49.840]   I mean, I've never seen anything like this.
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:51.560]   Everybody was passing this URL around.
[00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:53.200]   So she comes out, she's very frumpy.
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:55.600]   She's got big, thick beetle brows.
[00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:58.680]   She's just kind of, you know, I mean, and everybody's going, "Oh, this is going to be
[00:48:58.680 --> 00:48:59.680]   bad."
[00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:01.320]   She says, "I want to be a lane page."
[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:03.880]   And then she sings the song from Lane Biz.
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:05.640]   She's done with a screw squawk, your voice head.
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:07.320]   "I want to be a lane page."
[00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:09.080]   Yes, I'm well, no.
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:11.080]   That's my goal in life.
[00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:13.120]   I could do it like Mrs. Doubtfire.
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:15.680]   "Oh, dear, I want to be a lane page."
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:17.440]   Oh my God, you've seen that movie, "Wait till we--"
[00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:18.440]   I love that movie.
[00:49:18.440 --> 00:49:20.200]   It's a great movie.
[00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:21.960]   So anyway, what was I saying?
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:24.960]   So she comes out and she sings a song for all of us.
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:26.720]   And it's like, "Wow, it's Sarah Brightman."
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:28.040]   I mean, it was incredible.
[00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:31.520]   And now, okay, you're the TV person.
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:35.280]   Your opinion was when they had those pictures of the judges, like shocked.
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:36.520]   I knew I already saw it.
[00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:37.520]   Totally funny.
[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:41.360]   I mean, Simon Cowell being like, "Is eyebrows go up at the right moment?"
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:42.360]   It was so perfect.
[00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:43.560]   It was like, "Do it right now."
[00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:44.880]   And those shows are live to tape.
[00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:45.880]   That's how it works.
[00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:46.880]   How it works to tape.
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:47.880]   They ISO every camera.
[00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:48.880]   They record everything.
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:50.680]   Yeah, they're shooting every judge.
[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:51.680]   They're shooting-- they probably have what?
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:52.680]   10 cameras.
[00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:53.680]   And the two clowns backstage.
[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:54.680]   I actually like that.
[00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:55.680]   We should have that on "American Idol."
[00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:57.840]   Should have it on our show here.
[00:49:57.840 --> 00:49:58.840]   Yeah.
[00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:00.840]   Can you believe what the book is?
[00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:03.360]   How much does either you arrive?
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:04.360]   Which "American Idol" is?
[00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:05.360]   It's your voice.
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:06.360]   Your life or us?
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:07.360]   Yeah, I don't know if this shows.
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:09.000]   But this was the audition, so it wasn't live.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   So it's live to tape, which means that you import it--
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   Yeah, it's huge.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:13.480]   You say you count it down.
[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:15.200]   It's pretty much live to tape, but then you have an edit.
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:16.200]   So you're doing it nonstop.
[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:17.200]   You're trying not to stop.
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:18.200]   It's easier.
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:19.200]   Right.
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:21.600]   And you could easily tell judges to redo something.
[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:22.600]   Let me ask.
[00:50:22.600 --> 00:50:26.040]   You also know the reaction that the director wants.
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:30.840]   And the audition for this-- the fact is the judges and the producers have seen her perform
[00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:31.840]   probably at least three times--
[00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:32.840]   Not those judges.
[00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:33.840]   Do you think those judges have seen you before?
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:35.840]   No, but they hear the buzz of who's coming.
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:39.200]   Certainly the producers knew what was coming up.
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:43.680]   Currie's wife is doing one of these reality shows in Holland.
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:44.880]   Is she producing it?
[00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:46.560]   No, she's a singer.
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:48.280]   She's pretty famous.
[00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:50.840]   And he's back there all the time.
[00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:53.880]   This show is hugely popular, so it's as big as any of them.
[00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:56.240]   And he says that the whole thing is completely--
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:57.240]   Oh, they're all rigged.
[00:50:57.240 --> 00:51:00.240]   But that cow is the one who probably set the whole thing up.
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:03.560]   And now that this record's coming out, cow-- of course, if you do any of these shows,
[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:06.600]   and as soon as you sign up the dotted line, they get your first board.
[00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:07.600]   They own you.
[00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:08.840]   So they get a piece of the action.
[00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:10.920]   So this is just a huge money-making scheme.
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:11.920]   And it's buzz.
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:15.720]   It's the fact is you know when you go against the grain and you put some of that you totally
[00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:17.320]   don't expect as talent.
[00:51:17.320 --> 00:51:18.680]   OK, I got it.
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:22.200]   My wife and I-- actually, I found the link.
[00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:23.200]   I played it.
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:24.200]   I went, wow.
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:25.200]   I said, Jennifer, quick.
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:26.200]   Got to see this.
[00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:27.200]   I did this.
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:28.200]   Our tears are going down our face.
[00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:29.200]   When I first saw it, I was very impressed.
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:30.200]   I was blown away.
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:31.200]   I'm not kidding.
[00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:32.200]   I'm admitting this.
[00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:33.200]   Both of us are--
[00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:34.200]   so beautiful.
[00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:37.280]   But afterwards, I thought, this was a little too pad.
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:38.600]   It was a little too perfect.
[00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:40.720]   I would never say this to Jennifer.
[00:51:40.720 --> 00:51:42.120]   She would not be happy.
[00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:43.120]   She wants to believe this.
[00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:44.120]   And that's what I'm saying.
[00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:45.120]   No, I think it's a disappointment.
[00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:47.360]   By the way, the curry thing is Holland's got talent.
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:51.760]   And somebody just sent me a note saying they want me to say that American idols are fraud.
[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:53.160]   So I don't know what it was.
[00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:54.520]   Well, you know, we're going to get--
[00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:56.280]   I hate these shows, by the way.
[00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:58.000]   So I can jump on that.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   We're going to get Woz on because he was in Dancing with the Stars.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   They signed on disclosures.
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.680]   Well, an interesting thing happened.
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:05.680]   We loved Woz.
[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:06.960]   He was a terrible dancer.
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:08.600]   But he survived the first cut.
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:10.160]   And he got to the second round.
[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:11.160]   He was terrible.
[00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:12.160]   He had the third round.
[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:13.840]   Yeah, I think he had the third round.
[00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:17.680]   But anyway, one of the judges at one point said, this is like a tele-tubby dancing.
[00:52:17.680 --> 00:52:18.680]   This is not dancing.
[00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:20.480]   That was a little bit.
[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:21.960]   But it was scripted.
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:24.960]   Well, and that was-- now, this was an interesting thing that happened.
[00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:28.960]   Woz said, this whole thing is scripted.
[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:31.000]   They're not telling us what the votes are.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:35.680]   I mean, I know that they saved us for the dance-off, even though I know I have enough votes from
[00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:38.520]   the audience to not be at risk.
[00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:41.160]   But they wanted me and the dance-off in the first round.
[00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:44.960]   He said that, and literally two hours later, were completely recanted because, of course,
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:47.920]   a lawyer comes knocking saying, you remember this thing you signed Woz?
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:49.020]   How much are you worth?
[00:52:49.020 --> 00:52:52.200]   How much would you like to be worth after we go to court?
[00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:53.200]   I've got to get Woz on.
[00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:54.200]   He probably still can't say anything.
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:55.200]   He won't say much.
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:57.960]   In fact, I just started with the survivor showing because there was a lawsuit.
[00:52:57.960 --> 00:52:59.440]   And I talked to the lawyer that was handling it.
[00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:04.320]   One of the people in the first survivor got deathly ill and some weird thing happened
[00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:05.320]   to her.
[00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:07.400]   And they had to sue the show to get the money that they were guaranteed.
[00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:08.400]   I remember that.
[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:09.400]   Yeah.
[00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:10.400]   And the guy telling me-- he was telling me.
[00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:13.000]   He says, the whole thing, and they got all these people on non-disclosures, they won't
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:14.760]   let you know what's going on.
[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:18.040]   Bernad himself is kind of like backs off a lot of this, and he says, look, it's not
[00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:19.040]   a reality TV show.
[00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:21.040]   It's an unscripted drama.
[00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:22.040]   Yeah.
[00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:23.040]   And what they--
[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:24.040]   Ooh, that's great.
[00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:25.040]   That's what he called it.
[00:53:25.040 --> 00:53:26.040]   It's not reality.
[00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:27.040]   It's unscripted drama.
[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:29.920]   And I'm eventually saying, we're making it up.
[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:30.920]   This is not true.
[00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:33.320]   A lot of the producers I know that work on these shows that edit them, they call them
[00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:34.320]   Frankenbites.
[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:35.320]   Because--
[00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:36.720]   You're looking for that moment.
[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:40.080]   You look for that moment, but besides that, they can edit specific words.
[00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:41.080]   Oh.
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:43.080]   They into a sentence and put it over a few rolls.
[00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:44.080]   Right.
[00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:45.080]   And so you think-- and if you look at all these--
[00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:46.080]   Well, it's easier just to have you do it.
[00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:48.680]   I mean, if you-- like, they would have two people.
[00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:51.200]   Okay, you and-- you and Lee are going to be sitting at the table together.
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:52.200]   They could--
[00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:55.240]   Now, do something, do something to piss her off, and I want you to throw a glass of wine
[00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:56.240]   in his face.
[00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:57.920]   But you don't even need to say that.
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:53:59.560]   It could be from an hour ago.
[00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:01.200]   They could-- they could snip it together.
[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:04.760]   Five hours later, I was just like sitting looking like this, and they can make it like
[00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:06.280]   our conversation when we're buying.
[00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:11.280]   Well, actually, with the Gordon Ramsay shows that had the Hell's Kitchen and some of these
[00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:12.280]   things are when he's--
[00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:13.280]   Yeah.
[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:18.040]   Or when he goes in and he fixes the place up, and whatever the show that is, Kitchen Nightmares,
[00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:23.520]   they would show-- something by stepson Eric, who is the coder, he's one of those guys
[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:26.440]   who sees the microphones and finds stuff out of sequence.
[00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:29.560]   And why are they wearing the button on this side and set it this side?
[00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:34.360]   And he just pointed out that at the end-- he was doing the wrap of the show, but they had
[00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:37.520]   the old restaurant before they refurbished it.
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:39.000]   So he was doing the end at the beginning.
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:40.000]   He was doing the end at the beginning.
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   And we do that all the time.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:42.000]   Come on.
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   I do this show.
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   The public doesn't know that.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   The show is taped for months now.
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:48.840]   And that's why your wife-- that's why your-- yeah, it's just--
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:50.480]   It's exactly winter representing you.
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:54.760]   I'm only pretending we're dying.
[00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:57.840]   But a lot of people get into it, and it's like soap operas.
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:00.640]   All right, you guys, just take a break a little bit here.
[00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:05.440]   Have a glass of wine or something, because I want to talk about audible.com.
[00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:07.000]   Then we'll get back to the non-news.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.800]   The Twitter stories, more Twitter all the time.
[00:55:09.800 --> 00:55:11.800]   No, I think we're done with the Twitter.
[00:55:11.800 --> 00:55:17.440]   But if you want to mention our friends at audible, audible.com/twit.
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:22.120]   Have you ever tried audiobooks?
[00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:25.320]   And I want to actually-- I want to give you a new URL for the folks who want to do two
[00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:26.320]   books.
[00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:27.320]   It's audible.com/twit2.
[00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:28.920]   I'll tell you about that in a second.
[00:55:28.920 --> 00:55:35.800]   Audiobooks, to me, I'm trying to think of when I got into them.
[00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:40.360]   I think it was when I first started mine-- and this was about 13 years ago-- my long commute
[00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:49.240]   from here to the San Francisco studios, first with MSNBC and then tech TV.
[00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:53.320]   It was an hour each way on a good day, and it could be as long as two hours each way.
[00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:57.800]   And I'll tell you what, I would have gone crazy if I hadn't had audiobooks.
[00:55:57.800 --> 00:56:00.160]   But I just transformed the trip.
[00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:03.440]   It made my commute not only tolerable, but something I looked forward to.
[00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:05.800]   It was library time.
[00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:06.960]   I've read hundreds of books.
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:12.760]   And I started off first with a little cassettes, and I've moved in 2001.
[00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:16.920]   I moved to Audible, and I have never looked back.
[00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:20.520]   Audible.com/twit2.
[00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:22.640]   Audible.com/twit2.
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:25.160]   This is the plan I've been on since 2000.
[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:26.560]   It's called the platinum plan.
[00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:28.400]   You get two books a month.
[00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:31.800]   This is for the person who does a long commute or does a lot of time in the gym.
[00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:32.800]   It's funny.
[00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:36.320]   I don't commute anymore, but I spend an hour and a day in the gym.
[00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:38.240]   I still get that library time.
[00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:43.480]   And it can be boring on the treadmill or the bicycle, but if you've got that book to listen
[00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:45.480]   to, it goes by so fast.
[00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:47.320]   Sometimes I'll look up and go, "Wow, I'm done."
[00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:51.920]   And I'll say, "Well, let me do another lap because I'm in the middle of the book."
[00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:58.080]   I just started a book that was recommended for me.
[00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:06.080]   I kind of remember if it was Paul Therot or Andy and Naco who recommended this.
[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:11.600]   One of our other show hosts that I am loving.
[00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:13.920]   It's a very, very long book.
[00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:14.920]   Peter Matiasen.
[00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:17.440]   It's called Shadow Country.
[00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:21.560]   It's the history of Florida at the turn of the century.
[00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:26.400]   And the dialect that the guy uses, Shadow Country, Peter Matiasen.
[00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:27.800]   Yeah, there it is.
[00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:33.520]   The dialect, the guy who's reading this, it's a bravura performance.
[00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:36.560]   It is amazing.
[00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:39.840]   It's a new, they call it a new rendering of the Watson legend.
[00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:45.840]   It reimagines the legend of the inspired Evergrage Glades Sugar Planner and notorious outlaw
[00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:47.160]   E.J. Watson.
[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:48.600]   I'd never heard of him.
[00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:52.320]   Maybe for Florida you have.
[00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:54.240]   But what a cast of wild characters.
[00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:57.800]   Let me just play a little bit of, oh, I can't.
[00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:00.160]   I don't have the, do me a favor.
[00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:01.160]   Do this.
[00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:02.160]   Go to audible.com.
[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:03.160]   You could do this yourself.
[00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:06.280]   Go to audible.com/twit2.
[00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:09.520]   Sign up for the platinum account.
[00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:10.920]   And then this could be your first book.
[00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:14.240]   I think this might be two credits because it's a very, it's 40 hours.
[00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:15.400]   It's a little long.
[00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:18.720]   Let's see, I like long books, 40 hours.
[00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:21.480]   You know, that was, that was two weeks in the car.
[00:58:21.480 --> 00:58:25.880]   If this will get me to take me a month to get through on the treadmill.
[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:28.040]   But oh man, is this stuff great.
[00:58:28.040 --> 00:58:29.240]   I am just digging it.
[00:58:29.240 --> 00:58:34.400]   I'm here with Thias and it's one of those books that, you know, you just, it's a, it's a time
[00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:36.080]   and a place it evokes.
[00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:37.720]   If you go there, you can listen to it yourself.
[00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:40.560]   They have previews, little samples of it.
[00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:41.560]   And this could be yours free.
[00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:42.720]   It's normally $48.
[00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:44.560]   It's free.
[00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:46.480]   Shadow country.
[00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:48.880]   This is one of those books you're going to get engrossed in.
[00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:53.840]   And the reader, Anthony Heald, is absolutely brilliant.
[00:58:53.840 --> 00:58:54.840]   Absolutely brilliant.
[00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:56.040]   I just love it.
[00:58:56.040 --> 00:58:57.040]   So give it a try.
[00:58:57.040 --> 00:59:06.200]   Go to www.thepretit.com/twit2 you get the platinum account, two books.
[00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:08.440]   You get to, let's come to, two credits a month.
[00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:15.520]   You also get free subscription to the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times Daily.
[00:59:15.520 --> 00:59:17.960]   You get a, I didn't know this.
[00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:19.200]   I haven't been mentioning this.
[00:59:19.200 --> 00:59:22.240]   I'm just seeing here, you get a free subscription to the Wall Street Journal and the New York
[00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:24.920]   Times Daily audio programs and two books.
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:33.840]   This offers good in the US and Canada.
[00:59:33.840 --> 00:59:35.400]   And it is, it is just wonderful.
[00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:36.400]   I am a big fan.
[00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:37.400]   Give it a try.
[00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:38.400]   Would you do me a favor?
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:40.400]   And if you're looking for a book, there's 50,000 titles.
[00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:45.040]   But if you're looking for a book, try Shadow Country by Peter Matthiason.
[00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:46.040]   Amazing.
[00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:54.880]   Audible.com/twit2 you get two free audio books, two credits toward a free book.
[00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:59.120]   And then two book credits a month and you're going to love it.
[00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:02.920]   Audible.com/twit2 we thank them so much for their support of This Week in Tech.
[01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:04.480]   We couldn't do without you guys at Audible.
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:05.480]   This is interesting.
[01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:06.480]   The Miramax story.
[01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:11.120]   I think this is interesting how, and this is how traditional, an example of how traditional
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:13.600]   media is dealing, I guess, with all this new media.
[01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:17.320]   They offer two free passes to prevent piracy via Twitter.
[01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:18.320]   What is that all about?
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:19.320]   I'm just wondering.
[01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:20.320]   Okay, that story is kind of interesting.
[01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:22.560]   So a girl, oh, it's a Twitter story.
[01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:23.560]   That's okay.
[01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:24.560]   Sorry.
[01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:26.400]   This one, you have to have a drink.
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:27.400]   Drink, drink.
[01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:28.840]   You're going to give me a pass.
[01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:31.040]   You're going to be a pass on this one, John?
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:33.640]   But this one I think is acceptable.
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:34.800]   It's an interesting story.
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:41.000]   And actually it shows how a company can use Twitter, I think, very effectively if they
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.520]   know what they're doing.
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:47.200]   So the story starts with Twitter, it starts with a young lady pirating, saying, "Where
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:49.800]   can I find a bit torrent of Adventure Land?
[01:00:49.800 --> 01:00:51.040]   I'm just dying to see it.
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:53.160]   Where can I download it?"
[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:55.080]   And is it Miramax Films?
[01:00:55.080 --> 01:00:56.080]   I can't remember.
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:57.080]   I think it's Miramax Films.
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:58.080]   It's Miramax here.
[01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:03.360]   Twitter's her back saying, "Oh, don't pirate it.
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:04.760]   Think about the people who made the movie.
[01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:05.760]   Don't pirate it.
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:06.760]   They don't threaten anything.
[01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:08.560]   They just say, "Oh, please don't."
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:12.280]   And she says, "All right, because it's you and you ask nicely, I won't pirate it."
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:15.160]   And they then send her two passes to a movie.
[01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:17.120]   So is that the new way of doing it?
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:18.120]   I think it's very interesting.
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:23.040]   I've been seeing that more and more on Twitter where if you tweet some kind of...
[01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:28.840]   ...products name, then they will add you right away and maybe even contact you.
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:29.840]   Really?
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:30.840]   Let me just check that out.
[01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:31.840]   Does this make sense, though, for a company to do this?
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:32.840]   Is this crazy?
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:37.680]   These companies are giving all that way to Twitter that you denied existed.
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:38.680]   I mean, they're acting like this is...
[01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:40.120]   No, no, I never said that.
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:41.240]   I never denied it existed.
[01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:42.240]   When was this?
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:43.240]   I don't know.
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:44.240]   I thought you did.
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:46.400]   No, I know when you said that Britney Spears was going to come in and take over the place.
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:47.400]   No, you did say that.
[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:48.400]   And you were close.
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:50.920]   Britney almost got to a million.
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:54.280]   No, but we were saying, "Oh, come on, it's just a fraction of the total world.
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:55.520]   It's not the real world.
[01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:57.320]   Why are we giving it so much weight?"
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:00.720]   But yet these companies say, "Hey, a bad stuff happens about us on Twitter.
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:01.760]   That's something we have to deal with.
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:02.760]   They must..."
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:03.760]   Is that a...
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:04.760]   Is that the right attitude?
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:07.640]   It's seen as the tip of an iceberg.
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:10.400]   That's why they get so carried away when just a few people bitch.
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:12.960]   But I think it's cool because it's making people...
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:15.160]   ...companies and people accessible.
[01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:16.640]   But accessible to who?
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:18.320]   The few million people on Twitter?
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:19.320]   That's a fraction of it.
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:22.320]   We are saying like, "Twitter says a huge thing."
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:26.440]   But yeah, if you look at the amount of people involved in it, nothing compared to the rest
[01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:27.440]   of the world.
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:30.560]   Don't you think real people should start to say, "Well gosh, how do we get good customer
[01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:31.560]   service?"
[01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:33.560]   You mean I have to go on Twitter to get good customer service?
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:35.800]   No, that's a problem with the companies.
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:38.200]   We should have to ask for good customer service.
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:42.080]   The fact is we should be supporting companies like a Zappos that is creating that culture
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:43.080]   around their company.
[01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:44.600]   Is that something you learned at food camp?
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:47.120]   No, I know Tony and I respect the company.
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:48.120]   Who's asking?
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:49.120]   That was an amazing story.
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:52.000]   They became in a billion dollar shoe company in a commodity business.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:56.880]   I got a good response when I went to Comcast Cares and I used Twitter to do it.
[01:02:56.880 --> 01:02:58.120]   Frank does a great job.
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:02:59.120]   Frank's a good guy.
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:00.120]   Frank?
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:01.120]   No, I'm not.
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:02.120]   You're wrong.
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:03.760]   And people are saying, "Oh, Zappos, I'm paid."
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:04.760]   I'm not...
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:05.760]   No, no, no, no.
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:07.240]   Zappos is a very good example of other sports.
[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:14.280]   I just think that's the next wave of entrepreneurship and companies and brands is in terms of creating
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:16.920]   culture around it and the fact is you need to communicate.
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:17.920]   Not just through Twitter.
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:19.120]   Twitter is just one tool.
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:20.120]   The problem is...
[01:03:20.120 --> 01:03:22.960]   And if people realize that it's beyond that, then they'll see something bigger.
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:24.920]   Here's the problem.
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:25.920]   Twitter is managing...
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:27.320]   Now, now we're off the track again.
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:28.320]   But go ahead.
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:29.320]   I'm sorry.
[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:31.040]   Twitter is manageable because it's a few million people.
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:34.920]   If you have tens of millions of customers, you cannot offer that level of customer service.
[01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:36.920]   But they need to realize they can do that without Twitter.
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:37.920]   No, they can't.
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:39.560]   But meaning Twitter was one tool.
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:40.560]   I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:43.680]   But Twitter is one tool, but the fact is they realize they can't connect.
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:44.680]   My point.
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:45.680]   Do you see what I'm saying or...
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:46.680]   No.
[01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:48.680]   What I'm saying is that...
[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:52.520]   He's having a pure allergic reaction to the word Twitter.
[01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:53.920]   He's not listening to your words.
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:58.680]   I'm trying to listen to you, but your sentence structure has fallen apart of as of about 15
[01:03:58.680 --> 01:03:59.680]   minutes ago.
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:00.680]   All right.
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:03.880]   What I'm saying is that people are finally realizing that we can all connect and we can
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:05.240]   all help each other and you can connect.
[01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:06.240]   Who's people?
[01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:07.240]   Or brands and companies.
[01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:08.520]   So like a Miramax.
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:09.520]   Some people.
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:12.600]   And so they're looking at Twitter because it's like a trendy buzz thing.
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:15.960]   Gorg says in the chat room, and I think this is exactly what it's saying in the friend
[01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:16.960]   feed.
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:19.800]   Yeah, these companies, if you Twitter, they'll contact you, but try to call their telephone
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:20.800]   support lines.
[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:21.800]   But that's what I'm saying.
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:24.400]   They need to realize that there's something about connecting and it's beyond Twitter.
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:25.400]   It happens that now.
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:26.600]   But here's why they do it that way.
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:30.520]   It's cheap to hire three people to monitor Twitter.
[01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:33.480]   It's a lot more to have telephone support lines at work.
[01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:38.880]   This in a way is underscoring the BS of Twitter, the Ashton Kutcher BS of Twitter, which is
[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:43.000]   that it's somehow significant and that we're providing real customer support because we
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.200]   get pressed for our work on Twitter.
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:46.400]   It's not real customer support.
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:48.120]   They can't do real customer support.
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:50.760]   Try calling Comcast and saying, "My cable's down.
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:51.760]   They don't help you.
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:53.440]   You have to go on Twitter to do it."
[01:04:53.440 --> 01:04:56.120]   Well it's easy to manage Twitter because that's a few million people, right?
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:04:57.120]   Yeah.
[01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:02.440]   Well I think one of the most important things is how much, so Ashton Kutcher, he has million
[01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:03.640]   over a million.
[01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:08.160]   But how many of these people are actual engaging?
[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:09.160]   Yeah.
[01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:10.920]   Everyone joined and they're not--
[01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:12.720]   It's all phony baloney engagements.
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:13.720]   All right.
[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:23.480]   All right, Ashton Kutcher has his Facebook headquarter show, Facebook HQ and it has 10,000 views.
[01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:24.800]   But he has a million followers.
[01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:26.080]   So you can have followers.
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:28.520]   But it was a question I asked this week.
[01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:29.520]   What's more important?
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:32.520]   Quality or quantity of followers?
[01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:33.840]   Well clearly it's quality.
[01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:34.840]   But let me read you--
[01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:35.840]   Oh wow.
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:36.840]   Wow.
[01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:37.840]   I disagree.
[01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:38.840]   You don't think so?
[01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:39.840]   No.
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:40.840]   That's an interesting question.
[01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:42.880]   I mean you know when you're in mainstream media it's the raw numbers.
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:44.120]   Like Seinfeld has 18 million people.
[01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:48.160]   Nobody asks a question about how many people who have drunk asleep, you know, fornicating.
[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:50.240]   They just say there's 18 million people.
[01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:53.440]   But when we're talking about new media like this they very much-- our advertisers very
[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:56.480]   much care about who's watching.
[01:05:56.480 --> 01:06:00.120]   There is-- and that's why we can compete with larger media outlets because we offer
[01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:03.320]   a higher quality, a smaller number, but a higher quality of audience.
[01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:08.600]   I'm not saying-- now what you've done here with that commentary is change the subject.
[01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:11.440]   And I find it very amusing the way you did it.
[01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:15.120]   Because all of a sudden you change from Twitter to talking about--
[01:06:15.120 --> 01:06:18.280]   I'm trying to help you John, you're the one that doesn't want to talk about Twitter.
[01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:23.400]   I'm just going to say that the Twitter audience is the numbers probably more important than
[01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:25.000]   the quality of the people if you have like--
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.960]   Oh that's true and that's what's wrong with it is all we're saying.
[01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:29.760]   You're saying that's okay?
[01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:32.360]   You'd rather have a million Ashton Kutcher followers?
[01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:33.360]   Yeah.
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:34.360]   You would.
[01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:35.360]   Yeah.
[01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:36.360]   You think that's more valuable?
[01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:37.360]   Yeah.
[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:38.360]   I'm in the mailing list business.
[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:39.360]   That's right.
[01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:40.360]   You've always said that.
[01:06:40.360 --> 01:06:43.840]   Giving out CDs like AOL or actually engaging people with the progressive.
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:44.840]   You would and you know what?
[01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:45.840]   Yeah.
[01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:47.840]   Like a dev and then so you're like that as like I throw it.
[01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:48.840]   Yeah you see you're the idealist.
[01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:51.640]   You go to poo camp the next thing you know you're like--
[01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:54.360]   It's like in the end people are going to be having all these followers.
[01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:55.360]   John or--
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:07:00.280]   So it's like an AOL that sends out their CDs and we throw them out or something that's
[01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:01.280]   a bit more--
[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:02.280]   John or Vladimir, I couldn't remember his first name.
[01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:03.280]   It took you a while.
[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:04.280]   It took me a while.
[01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:05.280]   Go ahead, I'm sorry we're interrupting you.
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:06.280]   I'm just saying that.
[01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:07.720]   I think your throat is parched.
[01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:09.520]   Have a drink.
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:11.400]   I didn't say that word yet.
[01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:13.400]   I know these are supposed to be the two.
[01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:15.240]   They like to drink.
[01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:16.240]   Yeah.
[01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:17.240]   I just--
[01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:18.240]   You're the bitter one.
[01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:21.200]   If you have a million followers but they're not engaging.
[01:07:21.200 --> 01:07:24.640]   If they're not even on Twitter they're just kind of there once and they disappear.
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:31.400]   If you tell them okay you know check out my blog post, check out my photo and they're
[01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:34.080]   not engaging and you only get a thousand people going to have--
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:35.080]   What good is it?
[01:07:35.080 --> 01:07:36.080]   What good is it?
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:37.080]   But it doesn't matter.
[01:07:37.080 --> 01:07:42.040]   If you have a massive amount of people like even my followers.
[01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:43.880]   Who brought down Sheerel Azar's website?
[01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:45.880]   Who brought down--
[01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:48.720]   My guy said that it's going back up.
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:49.720]   Who brought it down?
[01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:50.720]   You.
[01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:51.720]   Ashton Kutcher?
[01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:52.720]   No.
[01:07:52.720 --> 01:07:53.720]   No, you.
[01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:54.720]   Oprah Winfrey?
[01:07:54.720 --> 01:07:55.720]   No.
[01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:56.720]   Who brought down Sheerel Azar's website?
[01:07:56.720 --> 01:07:57.720]   You Leo.
[01:07:57.720 --> 01:08:01.640]   Not because of the number because I don't have a million followers but because those
[01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:03.560]   two thousand people are actually listening to you.
[01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:04.880]   They're actually paying attention.
[01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:05.880]   I agree.
[01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:06.880]   I so--
[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:09.040]   Okay this is going to make John spew.
[01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:11.160]   Take a drink of wine while I tell you this story.
[01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:12.160]   Cheers.
[01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:13.520]   I'll tell you what bottom's up.
[01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:14.520]   Bottom's up.
[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:16.000]   She's John you're bad.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.000]   Come on.
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.640]   So Ashton Kutcher is on Ustream.
[01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:22.680]   He's streaming it's about 10 at night, 11 at night.
[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:24.720]   He's streaming as he's trying to get to 1 million people.
[01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:25.720]   2 13 a.m.
[01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:26.720]   Eastern time.
[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:31.520]   CNN has a 998,239 followers at CNN break.
[01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:33.160]   Ashton Kutcher crosses 1 million.
[01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:34.480]   He tweets to his followers.
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:35.480]   Victory Azar is now John.
[01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:38.800]   This is the part you're going to like John.
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:42.600]   "Astrid Kutcher, your friend Sheerel Azar.
[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:44.880]   This is like putting a man on the moon."
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:45.880]   Oh boy.
[01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:48.680]   "This is like changing media forever."
[01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:49.680]   Yeah.
[01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:50.680]   Right.
[01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:53.440]   "It's the web versus the world right now people."
[01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:56.280]   Can you believe this crap?
[01:08:56.280 --> 01:09:00.560]   I like how he takes credit for being the first.
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:01.560]   I don't blame him.
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:08.200]   CEO of Google, Mr. Eric Schmidt predicts good times ahead for Android.
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:12.360]   He says he's expecting Android on netbooks.
[01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:13.640]   Other mobile internet devices.
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:15.200]   He says we're not even pushing them to do it.
[01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:16.200]   They're doing it themselves.
[01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:18.680]   ASIS is doing it to netbooks.
[01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:21.440]   Rumor to be an EPC using Android.
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:27.080]   Android could become the first real challenger to Windows XP on these netbooks.
[01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:29.680]   Do any of you use G1 phone?
[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:30.680]   No.
[01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:31.680]   I do.
[01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:32.680]   Really?
[01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:33.680]   What do you think of it?
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:34.680]   I love it.
[01:09:34.680 --> 01:09:35.680]   No, you don't.
[01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:36.680]   Who wrote the battery life?
[01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:37.680]   It sucks.
[01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:38.680]   Terrible.
[01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:39.680]   Terrible.
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:40.680]   Makes the thing unusable.
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:41.680]   You know what's cool?
[01:09:41.680 --> 01:09:43.680]   You can watch us on the G1.
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:44.680]   Yeah.
[01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:45.680]   But you can watch it.
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:46.680]   You can watch it on the EPC.
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:47.680]   The G1 is the best.
[01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:48.680]   You can watch on the EPC.
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:49.680]   I'm sorry.
[01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:50.680]   I'll admit.
[01:09:50.680 --> 01:09:51.680]   Let's see what you got here.
[01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:52.680]   She's a blackberry.
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:53.680]   It looks like a curve.
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:54.680]   Is that a bold?
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:55.680]   It's a roll decision.
[01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:56.680]   No, I've got her phone.
[01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:57.680]   Oh god.
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:09:58.680]   No.
[01:09:58.680 --> 01:09:59.680]   See, if she follows any celebrities.
[01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:00.680]   Give that away.
[01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:01.680]   What celebrities does she follow?
[01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:03.680]   She's got somebody named Casey Klingon.
[01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:05.680]   I guess he's a guy who's an actor.
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:07.680]   These are my new Twitter friends.
[01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:08.680]   Okay.
[01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:10.680]   You mean them at food camp?
[01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:11.680]   Yes.
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:13.680]   You met them at food camp.
[01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:15.680]   No, this is, I should take off.
[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:17.680]   For some reason since, all right, this is weird.
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:18.680]   I don't know if this is a correlation.
[01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:19.680]   All right.
[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:20.680]   I'm not going back to Twitter.
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:26.240]   But since all the Twitter stuff happened on Friday, I've started like literally, I get alerts
[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:27.240]   every minute.
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:28.680]   Oh, you should turn that off.
[01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:29.680]   Turn that off.
[01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:30.680]   Oh, there's some.
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:31.680]   That's the first step.
[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:33.680]   Let's go back to the Android.
[01:10:33.680 --> 01:10:34.680]   Wait, wait.
[01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:36.680]   So in terms of phones, and what do you think?
[01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:37.680]   You know what I'm excited about?
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:38.680]   Yeah.
[01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:39.680]   And you're going to think I'm nuts.
[01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:40.680]   Can you just subject you to let her finish your sentence?
[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:41.680]   Go ahead.
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:42.680]   Please finish your sentence.
[01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:44.680]   No, I was saying I want to go back to that because we could go into other conversations.
[01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:45.680]   Fuck it, never mind Leo.
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:49.680]   Let's go back to the Android because I think that's what people want to talk about.
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:50.680]   I'm excited.
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:53.680]   Believe it or not, but the new sidekick looks really good.
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:55.680]   The 2009 sidekick.
[01:10:55.680 --> 01:10:59.680]   And it has, yeah, I know, is that weird?
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:00.680]   That is weird.
[01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:04.680]   Oh my God, I had an ex-boyfriend that was totally into the sidekick back in the day.
[01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:07.680]   And he would be like, it's like that flip thing.
[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:09.680]   Yeah, who would flip thing?
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:11.680]   It was for young people.
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:12.680]   He was probably pretty young.
[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:13.680]   What is so cool about the sidekick?
[01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:14.680]   How old was he?
[01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:16.680]   He was like, it was really 20s at the time.
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:17.680]   How old are you?
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:18.680]   At the time.
[01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:19.680]   In my early 20s at the time.
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:20.680]   Yeah.
[01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:21.680]   No, but what is the big thing about the sidekick?
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:22.680]   Why do people like it?
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:23.680]   Well, the new sidekick has never liked it.
[01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:24.680]   It's a big, always been a big brick.
[01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:25.680]   It's kind of a clunky thing.
[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:30.680]   The new one's thinner, better looking, has built in MySpace, Facebook and Twitter support.
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:32.680]   It's really focused on social network.
[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:34.680]   Do you think the phone to the next version?
[01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:37.680]   Do you think the next is going like, oh, what happened there?
[01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:38.680]   The iPhone, the iPhone does that.
[01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:39.680]   I'm still an iPhone fan.
[01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:40.680]   What?
[01:11:40.680 --> 01:11:43.680]   You can't text properly or write emails properly with the iPhone.
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:44.680]   That's the problem.
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:45.680]   You like the camera.
[01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:46.680]   It's challenging though.
[01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:47.680]   Challenging.
[01:11:47.680 --> 01:11:48.680]   Well, not what I've been driving in my car.
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:49.680]   Okay, Lisa.
[01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:51.680]   Okay, I'm going to give you a few reasons why you might want to look at this.
[01:11:51.680 --> 01:11:52.680]   Okay.
[01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:54.680]   I'm going to megapixel camera.
[01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:58.680]   Does video uploads it directly to YouTube.
[01:11:58.680 --> 01:11:59.680]   Wow.
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:02.680]   This might be a replacement for your N95.
[01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:05.680]   It also has built in GPS.
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:06.680]   It does pretty much it.
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:07.680]   Yes, 71 does all this.
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:09.680]   But I just got this one.
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:10.680]   You just got an iPhone?
[01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:12.680]   I waited for a very long time.
[01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:14.680]   You mean you just got an iPhone?
[01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:15.680]   Well, when Canada got them.
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:16.680]   Oh, yeah, you've got one.
[01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:17.680]   Yeah, because you know what?
[01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:21.680]   Canada actually has some issues because the cell phone, the, um, the camera.
[01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:24.680]   Um, the cost of, of your plans is different.
[01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:25.680]   I think so.
[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:26.680]   Like a hair trigger on this camera.
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:29.680]   Like they're just really not advanced with their cell phone coverage.
[01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:30.680]   Oh, it's terrible.
[01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:31.680]   And how much do you pay for data?
[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:32.680]   It's really ridiculous.
[01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:34.680]   Lisa, you must be paying through the nose on the data on this thing.
[01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:36.680]   It's bad, especially when I'm down here.
[01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:37.680]   I need to figure out.
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:38.680]   Yeah.
[01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:39.680]   I have the right, all right.
[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:42.680]   The Verizon Verizon plan, they use 7 North American plan.
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:46.680]   So I go to Canada and I don't need to have, need to pay for anything.
[01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:47.680]   Just minutes.
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:48.680]   Rumor has it.
[01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:49.680]   How do you like this?
[01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:51.680]   I phone app for Hulu.
[01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:53.680]   Would that put you over the top?
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:54.680]   Yes.
[01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:55.680]   Would that put you over there?
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:56.680]   That would make you, that would make you one iPhone.
[01:12:56.680 --> 01:13:01.680]   I love that about, I came here and, and I, you can't get Hulu in Canada.
[01:13:01.680 --> 01:13:02.680]   We can't get, or Pandora.
[01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:03.680]   What do you mean?
[01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:04.680]   You can't, that's ridiculous.
[01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:05.680]   You can't do a proxy.
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:06.680]   Yeah, you have to, you have to lie.
[01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:07.680]   Yeah.
[01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:08.680]   And it's too slow.
[01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:09.680]   Often the proxy is really making a yun-yun use.
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:10.680]   Yeah.
[01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:13.680]   I mean, I, I love that whenever I come down and like, ooh.
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:16.680]   That's like MTV back in the day when I was growing up.
[01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:18.680]   I couldn't get any American channels.
[01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:20.680]   I was just loading an MTV like the two networks.
[01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:22.680]   Now you have, you had much music.
[01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:25.680]   And now you have MTV Canada, which is god awful.
[01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:31.680]   But phones are obviously emulating almost cable TV that back in the day we couldn't get,
[01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:33.680]   like Canadian viewers couldn't get that.
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:36.680]   And so, but that's, it's so archaic to me.
[01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:42.680]   How with the technology, we can't find a way to bring that on phones to Canada, which is basically,
[01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:43.680]   it's all geography.
[01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:47.680]   It's just like borders that are separating us.
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:50.680]   Well, it's some, it has 23 apps.
[01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:51.680]   Everyone has hundreds.
[01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:53.680]   Oh, I, oh, she hasn't had time.
[01:13:53.680 --> 01:13:55.680]   I have, I have 10 pages of this.
[01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:56.680]   You got the flashlight though.
[01:13:56.680 --> 01:13:57.680]   You have a flashlight at it?
[01:13:57.680 --> 01:13:58.680]   The flashlight.
[01:13:58.680 --> 01:13:59.680]   I use that all the time.
[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:00.680]   Really?
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:01.680]   I do.
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:02.680]   For photos.
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:03.680]   Really?
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:04.680]   And for flashlight.
[01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:06.680]   You can do really cool lighting exposures with it.
[01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:08.680]   What's your favorite iPhone app right now?
[01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:11.680]   Um, do you have one that you use all of this?
[01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:12.680]   I love click.
[01:14:12.680 --> 01:14:13.680]   I don't know.
[01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:16.680]   Click is a Flickr application.
[01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:22.680]   And you can view, I love looking at sort of the explore photos.
[01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:25.680]   And I love looking at my, my contacts photos.
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:30.680]   Right now, I guess just what I've been looking at on the internet is just photography stuff.
[01:14:30.680 --> 01:14:31.680]   Right.
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:32.680]   That's what I did after the pandering.
[01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:34.680]   You said I'm going to settle down.
[01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:35.680]   I'm going to focus on my photography.
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:36.680]   I'm going to focus on my photography.
[01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:39.680]   And you know what you decided, it was kind of funny because you decided to take pictures of models
[01:14:39.680 --> 01:14:40.680]   instead of be the model.
[01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:41.680]   Yes.
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:43.680]   That gave you power.
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:45.680]   I took the power back.
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:47.680]   She's telling me what to do.
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:49.680]   She's power mad.
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:53.680]   No, but I think the photographer has the power in that relationship.
[01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:56.680]   This is getting weird.
[01:14:56.680 --> 01:14:58.680]   This is getting too weird.
[01:14:58.680 --> 01:14:59.680]   This show, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:01.680]   Or so wait, I look back at the phone.
[01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:02.680]   This is out of control.
[01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:04.680]   Because I feel like what?
[01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:06.680]   Let me just call in.
[01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:07.680]   Hold on.
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:11.400]   Before we go on, I want to mention, go to meeting.
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:12.400]   Go to meeting.
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:13.680]   Yes, our fine sponsors.
[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:14.680]   It's Citrix.
[01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:19.680]   Did you know the average cost of a business trip these days is $1,000.
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:23.320]   That's, you know, plain, fair, hotel, meals, cabs.
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:25.280]   It really adds up.
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:26.760]   And I have to ask you this question.
[01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:27.760]   Do you think it's more effective?
[01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:30.680]   Do you think you get more done?
[01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:32.080]   I think that's the old way of meeting.
[01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:35.000]   I think the new way of meeting is eliminate the waste.
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.000]   Of all the meetings you want for $49 a month.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.000]   $1,000, $49.
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:44.000]   And the thing is, they're just as effective because you're using Go to meeting.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.000]   Everybody with Go to meeting.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000]   I think you can go there right now.

[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:54.000]   You can send out an invitation via email.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:57.000]   You could say, while you're on the phone with somebody, and by the way, voice over internet
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.000]   and teleconferencing is free with Go to meeting.
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000]   So you can be on the phone in your voice conference.
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000]   Hey, I'd like to show you this PowerPoint.
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:07.000]   I'd like to show you the drawings of the website.
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:08.000]   And you give them the meeting ID.
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000]   You say, go to meeting.com.
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.000]   Go to go to meeting.com.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:13.000]   Here's the meeting ID.
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:14.000]   They enter it.
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:16.000]   Suddenly they're seeing your computer screen on their desktop.
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:19.000]   So they're seeing the stuff that you would show them if you were in person.
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000]   The PowerPoint.
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.000]   It's an award-winning service.
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:23.000]   It's completely secure.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:28.000]   It is so effective for sales presentations, for product demos, for training sessions,
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000]   collaboration.
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.000]   We've been using it.
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:35.000]   I think we have several accounts now because we use it.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:36.000]   Ray Maxwell uses it.
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.000]   I use it for a variety of different things.
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.000]   And I just find more and more ways to use it.
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.000]   I know you will too.
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000]   That's why the 30-day trial is so effective.
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000]   Gives you a chance to really get a sense of this.
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:46.000]   And no cost to you.
[01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000]   Go to go to meeting.com.
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:51.000]   Go to go to meeting.com.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.000]   Go to meeting.com/twit.

[01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:00.000]   Go to meeting.com/twit.
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.000]   Okay.
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.000]   Let's see here.
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.000]   The big story that people want to talk about and I see is coming up in the chat because
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000]   I'm in the chat is the Time Warner story.
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.000]   We did that.
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.000]   What is she on?
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:10.000]   Is that a PR38 or what's the number?
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.000]   No, that's PR40.
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.000]   How come it's shiny?
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.000]   Well, she's newer than yours.
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:15.000]   You've got it.
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.000]   Yours is tarnished by spittle.
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.000]   No, no, I suppose it was.
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.000]   I don't know a story.
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.000]   I'm sorry.
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.000]   He's shined it up.
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.000]   No, no, no, no, that's a good story.
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.000]   But we did it last week.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000]   Why are people still talking about it?
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:26.000]   Because people don't listen.
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000]   They think they listen to the show, but they don't.
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.000]   People listen to every single word of every single show.
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:31.000]   Last week, last week.
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:32.000]   So here's what happened with Time Warner.
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:35.000]   They announced they were going to do caps.
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.000]   Alright.
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:37.000]   Pretty serious caps.
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:38.000]   Yeah, remember this.
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.000]   50 gigabyte caps.
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000]   And then they kind of backed off and tiered.
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.000]   And this is John.
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:43.000]   Go back and listen to Twit 190.
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.000]   John and I talk about it.
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.000]   I listened to that one two or three times so far.
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.000]   So this old news guys.
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:51.000]   John, how's no agenda going?
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.000]   No agenda is a great show.
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:56.000]   It was every Thursday and it's also on Sunday.
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:58.000]   And unfortunately next week is going to be kind of confused.
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:17:59.000]   Because we get good numbers.
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.000]   We get about 250,000 listeners.
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.000]   You're so full of it.
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.000]   You do not have 250,000 listeners.
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:05.000]   We do.
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:07.000]   If Adam is telling you that, he is lying to you.
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:08.000]   No, we have lots.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.000]   Okay.
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:12.000]   And so you can go to knowagenda.mebo.com if you want to listen in.
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:15.000]   Or go to knowagenda stream, which we have a really, yeah, he's streaming it.
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.000]   That's kind of a interesting.
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:17.000]   That's like a radio show.
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.000]   He loves radio.
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:25.000]   I want to thank Elvin Trustee for sending me the University of Findley 2009 NCAA.
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:29.000]   NCAA National Championship and men's division to basketball.
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:31.000]   Thank you for the hoodie.
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:32.000]   It's a beauty.
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:37.000]   So everybody wants me to bring up the dig bar for the third show in a row.
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:39.000]   I have brought this stupid story up.
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:41.000]   Every show for the last four shows.
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.000]   Let's see if we get any more interest.
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:43.000]   Dig bar.
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:44.000]   What do you think?
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:47.000]   What is the dig bar?
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:50.000]   It's keeping people in the sight.
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:52.000]   They actually backed off.
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.000]   They backed off a little bit on the dig bar this week.
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:59.000]   Well, the whole thing is, and I was also asking that for a while, is that he used to be within
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:03.000]   that world, the dig world, and it's like instead the reason why everyone likes--
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.000]   Kevin apologized.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.000]   He said, yeah, you're right.
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.000]   We did it wrong.
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:07.000]   Did what wrong?
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.000]   The dig bar.
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.000]   Oh, the dig bar.
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000]   You're not even listening anymore.
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:12.000]   I'm sorry.
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.000]   You're right.
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.000]   But what do you think?
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.000]   I lost it.
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.000]   I didn't like the--
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.000]   I didn't like--
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:21.000]   The whole show of dig was that people were having a conversation amongst themselves.
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:22.000]   It helped kids to other--
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:26.000]   It helped people get hits and views to their sight.
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.000]   Kevin was on this show a few weeks ago.
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.000]   He said, we're going to do a URL shortener.
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.000]   I said, that's a great idea.
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:33.000]   Dig should do a URL shortener.
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:37.000]   Unfortunately, when they released it, it framed sites.
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:40.000]   The way you would do it, you'd type dig.com/a website.
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:44.000]   So you dig.com/HTTP/colon/mostlyleaser.com.
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:47.000]   People would get to mostlyleaser.com, but it would be--
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000]   All of the hits would go to dig.com.
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.000]   It would be framed within dig site.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.000]   So dig was getting the site.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:54.000]   Are you reframing?
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.000]   Yes.
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:19:56.000]   That's ridiculous.
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.000]   I agree.
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:58.000]   I think everybody stopped doing that years ago.
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.000]   It was very '90s.
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000]   People quite rightly complained about this.
[01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.000]   Kevin realized, yeah, you know what?
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:04.000]   We shouldn't have done that.
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:05.000]   They've backed off.
[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:07.000]   Now, a lot of sites did an interesting thing.
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.000]   In fact, I think it was Read Write website.
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.000]   Here's how you block the dig bar with a couple of lines of JavaScript.
[01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:13.000]   That's when I think dig realized--
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:16.000]   oops, see, we might have gone a little too far on this.
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:18.000]   It was a blatant grab for hits.
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.000]   Yeah.
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000]   It made perfect sense from a business point of view.
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:25.000]   It didn't make such a good idea from the internet community point of view.
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.000]   They have backed down now on it.
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.000]   And I think they did back down.
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:31.000]   Also, follow up on our story, John, from last week.
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:35.000]   Microsoft is going to do a company tavern after all.
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000]   Oh, that's a good thing.
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.000]   Wow.
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.000]   That's another bullet.
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:41.000]   They need drinks there at that place.
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.000]   I'm sure they have an open bar.
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:46.000]   They have insurance medical insurance.
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000]   They have insurance.
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000]   All the mountain too you can drink.
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:54.000]   They're only the really jumping place has got to be Google at the campus.
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:55.000]   I know.
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:56.000]   That place is great.
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:20:57.000]   Have you been there?
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.000]   No.
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.000]   Wait a minute.
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:00.000]   Wait a minute.
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:01.000]   What podcast serves the most wine?
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:02.000]   Well, apparently this one.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.000]   Yes, thank you.
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.000]   And sushi and cheese.
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.000]   Much to our detriment, I might add.
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.000]   No, I think the show is improved by the wine.
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.000]   I don't know.
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:10.000]   And the heat.
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:11.000]   It's great.
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.000]   The heat and the wine you had during the live.
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:13.000]   You can tell it's sweaty.
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000]   The wine ran in a food show.
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:18.000]   We got a bunch of sweaty whatever.
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.000]   Back here when I'm like hot.
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:25.000]   I think I believe that I not send you a note saying that it was going to be very warm in here and dress accordingly.
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.000]   I believe I did send you that.
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.000]   She doesn't have any clothes on barely.
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:29.000]   I'm pretty close.
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000]   This is the part of the show.
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000]   I'll have you know.
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:37.000]   I tried on so many different tops.
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:38.000]   Really?
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:41.000]   Yes, because people it's like, oh, you're wearing a low cut top and then.
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:43.000]   But you chose the low cut top.
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:44.000]   But I didn't.
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.000]   I'm worse.
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000]   She's trying to bring it up now.
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.000]   It's too late.
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:49.000]   It can't stretch it.
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.000]   No, she actually, she did.
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.000]   I was wearing a high like.
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:57.000]   Now we have to show down between the two women.
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.000]   Who's got the best top on.
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:03.000]   I decided to wear my Ralph Lauren shirt.
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:04.000]   This is a yellow shirt.
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.000]   This is something you don't see a lot of.
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:08.000]   It's a button down collar on a Hawaiian shirt.
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.000]   Ralph Lauren design.
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.000]   What do you think?
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.000]   I've worn this for many years.
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:12.000]   I found this to be very attractive.
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:16.000]   I'm going to bring up a story since we're talking about Hawaiian shirts.
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:19.000]   Leo used to work at his place called Tech TV.
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.000]   I remember it.
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000]   And he used to wear.
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:24.000]   People are doing the F.
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000]   People are replying.
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:27.000]   All right, guys.
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:29.000]   This is why he replied at more.
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.000]   I never get this story.
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000]   With the F being sureless, I'm a geek.
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:33.000]   What are they saying?
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:36.000]   They're saying F being sureless, I'm a geek.
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.000]   But they're not doing it right.
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:40.000]   They're doing F, sureless, I'll help sure.
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.000]   That's what you need.
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:44.600]   Are you shocked by the fact that if you were doing this, that's what we told him to do it?
[01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:46.200]   I think I'm always shocked no matter what.
[01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:49.000]   I think maybe that creates my naivety towards...
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:51.000]   You have negativity towards what?
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.000]   I evite.
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.000]   Oh, naivety.
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:54.000]   No, I evite.
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:58.000]   I think it's great when you come to things like you can't expect anything, but when you see people
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000]   responding, that's so amazing.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000]   Like sometimes I put out videos and I'm...
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.000]   Oh, here's one.
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.000]   She's flabbergasted.
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:05.000]   From A-hon-run-dah-nail.
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.000]   A-hon-run-dah-nail.
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:10.000]   A-hon-run-dah-nail.
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:12.000]   He says, "Time Warner gave up because of complaints.
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000]   There are no tears now.
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000]   You're an ass to missing her story.
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000]   It's not old."
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:19.000]   Oh.
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.000]   You are an ass.
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.000]   I'm an ass.
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:24.000]   Dad is horrible what you did.
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:27.000]   Here's another one from Craig Dirling.
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:29.000]   This show is a train wreck.
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000]   Oh, he might have got that right.
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:33.000]   Unsubbing from the podcast.
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:34.000]   This just ain't what it used to be.
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:36.000]   People love train wrecks.
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:37.000]   What's funny?
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.000]   You haven't heard the podcast.
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000]   You're just watching the live show.
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000]   Yeah, the podcast is going to be...
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:43.000]   We're going to cut all this down.
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:46.000]   There are very few people realize how much post-production Leo puts into these things.
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:48.000]   He'll spend nights in the night.
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:51.000]   Well, this is the typical BS.
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:53.000]   Oh, I'll tell you what story we didn't do.
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:57.000]   And last Sunday was when it was breaking and we came very close to doing it and my
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:59.000]   instinct said, "Wait a little bit."
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.000]   And that's the Amazon fail story.
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:02.000]   You probably followed this.
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:04.000]   It was a big Twitter story.
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:06.000]   The hashtag was Amazon fail.
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:12.000]   Amazon all of a sudden on Sunday started delisting books that had gay and lesbian themes.
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:13.000]   On Easter Sunday.
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.000]   On Easter Sunday.
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.000]   This was last week.
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.000]   And there was a lot of tweeting going on, a lot of anger about it going on.
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.000]   People felt there couldn't possibly be a mistake.
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:26.000]   Amazon was actively discriminating against gays and lesbians.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:31.000]   I saw this at the time and I thought, you know, something doesn't feel right about this story.
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:32.000]   I'm not going to do it on Twitter.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.000]   We haven't heard the whole thing.
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.000]   The second sense.
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:39.000]   And I'm glad I did because I have, I mean, now we don't exactly know what happened.
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:42.000]   Amazon says, you know what, it was a database error.
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000]   This is what didn't sit right with me.
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.000]   Amazon probably has many gay and lesbian people working there.
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:52.000]   I'd be very shocked if they had any negative feelings toward gays and lesbians.
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:57.000]   They certainly would never ever have a policy where they would block this zero chance.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:01.000]   So I knew there was something wrong that this just didn't smell right.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:05.000]   However, a lot of people, in fact, people, maybe some people who should have known better,
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000]   jumped on this story and made it a big deal.
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.000]   In fact, a number of people had to back down and say, I'm sorry, I was wrong.
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:13.000]   On Twitter, everyone, it was revolted against Amazon.
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:18.000]   But it just shows you how quickly, and this is maybe the failing of this new media, is that
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:21.000]   the stuff can, without any kind of, it's a mob mentality.
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:22.000]   Yeah.
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.000]   Without any kind of democracy.
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:29.000]   So you're saying it's about engagement, not about meaning maybe the power of the web is
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:33.000]   not as much about just fully the content, but yeah, about the conversation.
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:34.000]   Yeah.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.000]   Do you know what I'm saying?
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:39.000]   Well, there's certainly conversation just as important as the content.
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:44.000]   But there is this mob sense where people can go out and they can attack other people.
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:49.000]   And it becomes, now I have to think Amazon got a little pain out of this.
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:53.000]   You know, how many people still believe Amazon discriminated against gays and lesbians?
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:57.000]   Because of the bad, because of this Amazon, the wave of fake news.
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:58.000]   Right.
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:25:59.000]   Fake news.
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000]   By the way, the way it's going to be from now on out.
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:02.000]   Now here's an example.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:03.000]   We're all doomed by this.
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.000]   Well, here's a good counter example.
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.000]   Domino's pizza.
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:12.000]   A very big viral video of two Domino's employees just, just, I mean, it was awful.
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.000]   I mean, they were spitting in the spoon.
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000]   They were farting on the sandwiches.
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:18.000]   It was really, it was gross.
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:19.000]   Yeah, I could.
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.000]   But I, now what do you think of the way a Domino's handled it?
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000]   They immediately, I thought it was very interesting.
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.000]   Robert Scoble made this point on "Friendfied."
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:27.000]   I think he was right on.
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:30.000]   What they did is they went back to that same medium.
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:31.000]   They went to YouTube.
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:36.000]   The president of Domino's made a video that was unfairly unscripted and fairly genuine,
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.000]   saying, "This is awful.
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000]   We fired those people.
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000]   We have sanitized that particular Domino's.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:45.000]   We actually closed it and sanitized the whole place so that you feel comfortable eating there.
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000]   This is not how we behave.
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000]   This is a very bad thing.
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:54.000]   We want you to know, we believe in the cleanliness of our food and we do not do this.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.000]   We do not endorse it.
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:56.000]   I think he handled that very well.
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:01.000]   Well, you know, the one thing I think they should have done also was sue those guys.
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:06.000]   Well, I'm sure they're being charged with felonies, which is pretty serious.
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.000]   But it's cool that it didn't.
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000]   I mean, the fact that we don't want to be eating that pizza.
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:10.000]   No, I agree with that.
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.000]   But now how much do you do?
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:14.000]   Go on and make these videos and they're not thinking.
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:17.000]   Remember this girl that got beat up by her friends?
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000]   Yeah, how stupid are these?
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:20.000]   But here's my point.
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.000]   Here's my point.
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:26.000]   Comparing contrast these two stories where Amazon got very much got a PR hit from this
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:32.000]   Amazon fail, did not, I think, respond as proactively and as effectively as Domino's, which could,
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:35.000]   I mean, this could have really damaged Domino's.
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:40.000]   How are brands supposed to take responsibility when this Twitter effect happens?
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:44.000]   Should they be coming out publicly or not?
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:47.000]   Like, what is the line of responsibility and like how?
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:50.000]   I'm just, I'm just interested in how you respond as a company.
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:51.000]   Yeah, how should you respond?
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:56.000]   When these relations agencies are having meetings 24, well, not 24/7.
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:58.000]   But should be the CEO or should be a PR?
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:00.000]   No, no, it should always be the CEO.
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:01.000]   What do you think?
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000]   I think it means more when it comes from the top.
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000]   Did you watch the Domino's response at all?
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:06.000]   I did, yeah.
[01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.000]   What do you think?
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:08.000]   Was it effective?
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:09.000]   It was effective.
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:13.000]   I mean, when they sort of reach out and not level.
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:16.000]   It was very effective, surprisingly so.
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:19.000]   You know, if you had asked me after the first video, I thought Domino's can't recover from this.
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:23.000]   Remember the, you know, there's always those rats in the McDonald's food and stuff.
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000]   And that stuff lives forever, these urban legends.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.000]   You see the one that's floating around about the Australian McDonald's,
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000]   the dirty place filled with paper and dirt?
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:31.000]   Thing is, thing is not bad.
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000]   It's on my, I sent it to you because it's-
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:34.000]   The more I'm censored, the more I can say.
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:35.000]   The more I can say, the more I can say.
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:40.000]   It establishes what you expect from the place, so you're like, okay, this is not a high quality place.
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:41.000]   But it gets in your mind.
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000]   It gets in your local one.
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000]   So you still go there.
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:46.000]   I mean, did it-
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:47.000]   Really?
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:48.000]   I don't know.
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:49.000]   Did it hit McDonald's?
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.000]   You know, I'll tell you when I first became aware of this.
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:53.000]   My kids, I'm riding in the car with four, 14 year old boys.
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:57.000]   And they're talking about this and they say, well, we're not gonna, let's order pizza tonight.
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:58.000]   Not Domino's.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:59.000]   Not Domino's.
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:02.000]   I would not order Domino's pizza for the reason that they ordered it.
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:03.000]   They ordered it every night.
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:04.000]   It's cardboard.
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:05.000]   They ordered it every night.
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:09.000]   It's gonna say something I hope people start choosing their local places to go.
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000]   Not as much corporate, but-
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:12.000]   Well, I agree with you.
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:13.000]   I think it's a shame.
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:14.000]   I'm with you.
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:16.000]   And places that create their food-
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:17.000]   I agree.
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:18.000]   They make it locally sustainable.
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:19.000]   They make it locally or get it sustainable.
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:20.000]   It's sustainable.
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:21.000]   It's a radius outside their city.
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000]   I mean, that's, I think, the new wave of looking at it.
[01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:24.000]   And there's actually-
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:29.000]   There's a sites that you can go to, which can find the food and the restaurants that get food in your area.
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.000]   Yeah.
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:33.000]   So I think that's the next place where we're going.
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:37.000]   Anyway, I just thought that was a very, I mean, what Amazon did, I thought was-
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:38.000]   Oh, not Amazon.
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:41.000]   I think Amazon did not handle it as well as they could have.
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:44.000]   Yeah, but you know, Amazon doesn't have a CEO that says presentable as a guy from Domino's.
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:45.000]   I mean, I think Bezos-
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:46.000]   Wait, I mean, Bezos could come on.
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:48.000]   Yeah, but if he laughs or something, it's over.
[01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.000]   Well, does he tell him, Jeff, you can't laugh.
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:51.000]   This is serious.
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000]   I don't think that's a problem.
[01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.000]   I think Jeff Bezos should have-
[01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:55.000]   No, he probably should have.
[01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:58.000]   He should have done a video or something he should have come forward.
[01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.000]   He said, "Let me tell you something."
[01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:00.000]   He's not-
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000]   We do not discriminate against gays and lesbians.
[01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:05.000]   We believe firmly in free speech at this company.
[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:07.000]   We would never do this intentionally.
[01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:08.000]   This was a programming error.
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:09.000]   We are very sorry.
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.000]   We'll never do it again.
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.000]   That would have been very effective.
[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:12.000]   I did not do that.
[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:14.000]   I think sometimes things like that happen.
[01:30:14.000 --> 01:30:16.000]   And as long as CEOs come out and are transparent, are-
[01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:17.000]   Exactly.
[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:18.000]   Since you're- it's okay.
[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:19.000]   Oh, I'm- I'm with you.
[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:20.000]   It's okay.
[01:30:20.000 --> 01:30:22.000]   And I think Domino's is the example of how you do it.
[01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:25.000]   And I think Amazon might be an example of how you don't do it.
[01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:26.000]   These things live forever.
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000]   I don't think you're really going to hurt Amazon at all.
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:29.000]   Maybe not.
[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:30.000]   I mean, Amazon may be not as vulnerable.
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.000]   But Domino's is-
[01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:32.000]   It gets-
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:33.000]   It gets her name out there more.
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:34.000]   And so people see it on Twitter.
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:35.000]   The latest trends.
[01:30:35.000 --> 01:30:36.000]   Amazon, they go do it.
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000]   I mean, in the end, it helps.
[01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:41.000]   But you just need to take responsibility for everything.
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.000]   Tech Illuminati had to stop listening to Twitter.
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:44.000]   Unlistenable, unsubbed.
[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000]   I seek tech news.
[01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:47.000]   Twitter doesn't have that.
[01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:48.000]   See?
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:51.000]   This is what I've been saying, by the way, to you listeners out there.
[01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.000]   Michael Graham says-
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.000]   Michael Graham says-
[01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:54.000]   The show from two years ago-
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.000]   Shut up.
[01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:56.000]   Was all news.
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:57.000]   That's a liar.
[01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000]   Michael Graham says, "I think it's important to fore-occur.
[01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000]   And it's hilarious."
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:02.000]   Oh, please.
[01:31:02.000 --> 01:31:03.000]   Oh, God.
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000]   You don't know what intoxicated is.
[01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:09.000]   Oh, and by the way, A-Haron doll, the guy I was talking said, "I'm sorry I see me, but
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000]   thanks for the mention."
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.000]   Yeah.
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000]   That's what it's all about.
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.000]   It really comes down to that.
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000]   It really comes to all of our all about.
[01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:21.000]   Twitter's gone off the rails tonight says Ben Sanders, but I like it.
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:22.000]   Oh, Ben.
[01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:23.000]   Ben's a good man.
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:24.000]   Or just being real.
[01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:27.000]   It was like if you were at a dinner and having a conversation-
[01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.000]   That's the problem.
[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:29.000]   This is like being at a dinner.
[01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:30.000]   Exactly.
[01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:31.000]   It wasn't a broadcast.
[01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:32.000]   It was dinner.
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:33.000]   It was dinner with nothing but-
[01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:34.000]   Well, we didn't eat dinner.
[01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000]   We didn't even have a main course.
[01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:39.000]   Lisa Bettany is mostly Lisa.com.
[01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:42.000]   She's a great photographer and a wonderful person.
[01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:43.000]   I'm so glad we saw you.
[01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:46.000]   I'm sorry that you had to come up here on such a hot day.
[01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:47.000]   It's nice, though.
[01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.000]   Well, I actually enjoyed it.
[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.000]   You actually look wet now.
[01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:50.000]   She's sweating.
[01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:51.000]   No, no, no.
[01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:53.000]   She looks- she's glowing.
[01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:54.000]   Horses sweat, John.
[01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.000]   Men perspire.
[01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:56.000]   But women-
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:58.000]   I was the cop of the show today.
[01:31:58.000 --> 01:31:59.000]   It's a good blow.
[01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:00.000]   Telling you off.
[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.000]   Good job.
[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.000]   Rest at everyone.
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.000]   Good job.
[01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000]   Cheryl Lazar is at Cheryl Lazar.com.
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000]   Oh, it's cold in here.
[01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:08.000]   She's freezing.
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:10.000]   That's why she's got the wool hat on.
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:14.000]   You can find- soon we're going to see the I Am A Geek video coming in a couple of weeks.
[01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:16.000]   Me, 11th, around then.
[01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:17.000]   Can't wait.
[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:18.000]   We'll be tweeting it out.
[01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:19.000]   And I'll be in it.
[01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:20.000]   Yes.
[01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:21.000]   And a lot of great people will be in it.
[01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:22.000]   Cheryl Lazar.com.
[01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:25.000]   Twitter.com/trotor.com/trotor.com/mostlyLisa.
[01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000]   Because they gave you back your name.
[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:28.000]   They did.
[01:32:28.000 --> 01:32:29.000]   Yay.
[01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000]   Yay, Twitter.
[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:33.000]   Do you say Twitter?
[01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000]   No, I love that.
[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:38.000]   I only got like 100 more followers.
[01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:39.000]   And I-
[01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:40.000]   You thought you'd get more.
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.000]   I thought- so when you say I come on the show.
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:43.000]   You talk a bit more.
[01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:45.000]   I just see I'm more Twitter followers.
[01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:46.000]   John C. Devorak.
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.000]   I'm not going home as she is.
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.000]   He is at channeldevorak.com.
[01:32:50.000 --> 01:32:52.000]   He also looks great in a Mouti hat.
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.000]   I think I should become a Mouti now.
[01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:55.000]   You- is that a Mouti hat?
[01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000]   I think there's a lot of Mouti jokes we can do as a matter of fact.
[01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.000]   That might be a forest ranger hat.
[01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:00.000]   It looks like a forest.
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:02.000]   Lady Indians ride bearback.
[01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.000]   Hey boo boo.
[01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.000]   Hey boo boo.
[01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:05.000]   Hey boo boo.
[01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.000]   Yeah, the Indians ride bearback.
[01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.000]   Channeldevorak.com.
[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.000]   Yeah, check me out at Noah Jenga.
[01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:10.000]   Heaks.com.
[01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:13.000]   He's going to be riding some horses later today.
[01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.000]   And I'll be riding horses later.
[01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.000]   But not bearback.
[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:16.000]   No.
[01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000]   Got no leandians do that.
[01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:22.000]   I hope this is not more than a half hour show for you.
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:25.000]   Those of you listening at home, if it is, I apologize for it.
[01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:28.000]   Because he's cut most of it out and he's just put in all ads.
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:31.000]   I have kids, all ads and a few stories.
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:32.000]   We thank you so much.
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:36.000]   I promise we'll get back on the shark and ride it into the sunset next week.
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:37.000]   Another twit.
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:38.000]   This is amazing.
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:39.000]   He's in a can.
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:55.000]   [Music]
