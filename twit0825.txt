[00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.260]   It also includes the apprentice.
[00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.680]   What is Jeff Bezos going to do with that?
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.900]   Twitter confirms its plans for a paid monthly subscription.
[00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.500]   Sam takes a look at the new F-150 electric vehicle.
[00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.700]   Who's going to buy that?
[00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.820]   And Charlie, bit my finger.
[00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.860]   No longer on YouTube, but somebody's a lot richer.
[00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.980]   It's all coming up next on "Trit."

[00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.900]   the tech-averse.
[00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.860]   Sam Ebel, Sam Ed is back with us.
[00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.300]   He is, of course, my car--
[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.740]   my official car guy, principal researcher,

[00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.700]   With our old friend, Roberta Baldwin, which is nice.
[00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:18.620]   He's your new host.
[00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.120]   That's great.

[00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.060]   And you talk about cars.
[00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.740]   In fact, you just did it every week.
[00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:26.620]   You just did it today.
[00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.060]   Yep.
[00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.780]   This is his third podcast of the day, folks.
[00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:31.940]   He's a marathoner.
[00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.100]   Thanks for being here, Sam.
[00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.300]   It's great to have you.
[00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.940]   My pleasure.
[00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.500]   Also joining us from the information,
[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.740]   the wonderful Paris Martineau and her new digs,
[00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.540]   a beautiful downtown Brooklyn.
[00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.460]   Happy to be here.
[00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.180]   Nice to see you.
[00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.300]   How's everything going?
[00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.380]   Everything's going good.
[00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.460]   Are people walking around--
[00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.980]   Brooklyn.
[00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.100]   Without masks and stuff like that these days.
[00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:56.220]   I mean, outside.
[00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.260]   Yeah, certainly.
[00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.300]   Everybody's very respectful in places that require masks.
[00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.820]   Yeah.
[00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.580]   Indoor dying for the first time today.
[00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:03.100]   Woo!
[00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.380]   Vaccinated, of course.
[00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.300]   How was that?
[00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.340]   How was that?
[00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.580]   Were there--
[00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:07.820]   Good.
[00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.460]   Yeah, there were people.
[00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.020]   I had a breakfast burrito.
[00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.340]   Wow.
[00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.020]   Isn't it funny, the little things that
[00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:18.980]   become so important after a year locked up inside?
[00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:19.860]   It's kind of amazing.
[00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:20.460]   I know.
[00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.220]   It's like I sat at a table.
[00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.180]   Yes.
[00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.340]   Lisa and I did that for the first time yesterday.
[00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.060]   And it was like, wow, this is interesting.
[00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.820]   It's a little scary.
[00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:30.180]   But--
[00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.620]   My wife and I did it two weeks ago, the first time
[00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.060]   in 15 months.
[00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.180]   And yeah, it was definitely weird.
[00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.540]   Things seem to be coming back, which is good.
[00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.100]   Everybody get your vaccine so we can keep it that way.
[00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.580]   Let's all do that.
[00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.940]   Brian McCulloch is also here from the Tech meme ride home podcast,
[00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.460]   internet historian.
[00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.960]   Hi, Brian.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.220]   Good to see you.
[00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.300]   Good to see you, Leo.
[00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.220]   Yeah.
[00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.540]   The last year or so when I would come in here to do these shows,
[00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.660]   I would bike over because I didn't take the train for a year.
[00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.820]   Speaking of things, feeling weird is when
[00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.780]   I started taking the train again because you really
[00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.100]   feel like you're like, should I be down here?
[00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.900]   Yeah.
[00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:07.740]   Yeah, I'm underground.
[00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.140]   It's probably pretty well ventilated.
[00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.820]   I figured that now.
[00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.180]   Now that I've been doing it for weeks,
[00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.460]   I'm like, this was probably not as dangerous
[00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.540]   as I was thinking all this time.
[00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.380]   The door is open and everything wishes out every--
[00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.500]   Yeah, the fine smell of urine pores in.
[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.500]   It's great.
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.220]   Yeah, the New York Times had some animation showing how the train
[00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.580]   cycles the air in and out.
[00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.580]   Every 20 minutes or so.
[00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:31.080]   In two minutes.
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.820]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.180]   I saw that.
[00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.700]   That's kind of--
[00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:34.860]   It was just the train--
[00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:35.860]   The tea air in.
[00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:36.860]   What does it smell like?
[00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.980]   It's so bad.
[00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.980]   They say they shut it down every night to clean.
[00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:41.380]   They do.
[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:42.620]   They hose it down and everything.
[00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.140]   I don't think the subway's never been quite so clean.
[00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:48.180]   So you used to ride your bike over the Brooklyn Bridge?
[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.580]   No, no, no, because I live in Park Slope.
[00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.420]   So it was just from one side of Brooklyn to the other.
[00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:59.460]   But also, I do the electric city bikes.
[00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.140]   So it's actually--
[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.660]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:01.500]   You don't even own a bike.
[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.660]   You just pick one up on the road.
[00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.700]   And it's exceedingly pleasant commute
[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.780]   because once you get across, go on us and whatever,
[00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.980]   the whole rest of the way is just along the waterfront
[00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:12.860]   right on the East River.
[00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.140]   So you've got to skyline--
[00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.700]   And it's protected, right?
[00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:17.380]   Exactly, right.
[00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.660]   That's my whole thing is I find all these routes where
[00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.900]   it's least on the road as possible.
[00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.260]   Right.
[00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.060]   Right.
[00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.780]   Are there a lot of protected bike lanes in Brooklyn
[00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.060]   and Manhattan?
[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.140]   There's one all along Prospect Park.
[00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.820]   There's one all along the waterfront here.
[00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.660]   They don't really connect well enough.
[00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.180]   That's what they really should plan out.
[00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:39.540]   So you could go everywhere, yeah.
[00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.940]   Right.
[00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.540]   There's always a gap somewhere where it's like, OK,
[00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.420]   I'm on Vanderbilt and I've got to deal with buses or whatever.
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.780]   But as long as you can minimize that.
[00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.060]   Yeah, and it's like, do I take the bus lane down?
[00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.300]   No, it's like, do I take a fast-moving car?
[00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.020]   What do I count?
[00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.140]   How do I count?
[00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.500]   Yeah, it's funny because here in Petalumi,
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.300]   you take your life and your hands again on a bike.
[00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.580]   There's no--
[00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.860]   There's no safe spots, no havens in the countryside.
[00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.100]   What should we start with?
[00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:11.060]   Amazon buys MGM for $8.5 billion.
[00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:12.340]   They got James Bond.
[00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:13.940]   Oh, the information scoop.
[00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.500]   Yes, I will give you full credit.
[00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:24.580]   So, A, it has to get by regulation, regulators, right?
[00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.380]   Which seems like it might be a little challenging.
[00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:28.500]   They make the content.
[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.580]   They distribute the content.
[00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.420]   Should they be allowed to do both?
[00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:35.580]   But there is an interesting sidebar to this.
[00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.180]   Not only-- they didn't get a lot of the musicals,
[00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:41.740]   but they did get James Bond.
[00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.500]   But there's also MGM TV, which owns,
[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:50.580]   besides the Handmaid's Tale and Fargo, the Apprentice.
[00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:53.860]   And apparently owns all the tapes of the Apprentice.
[00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:58.460]   So there has now been some speculation
[00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:03.060]   if Jeff Bezos, who's kind of been the hereditary enemy
[00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:06.060]   of a man named Donald Trump, might do something
[00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.940]   with those videos in the vaults.
[00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.340]   He would never do anything.
[00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:15.100]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.140]   He's sending things to space.
[00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.580]   He's too busy of a man.
[00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:19.980]   I hope he's too busy.
[00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:23.780]   You know, there may be stuff that's
[00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.500]   somewhat incriminating on who knows.
[00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:27.260]   But it doesn't matter, because if you
[00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:31.980]   have all the behind the scenes material of anything,
[00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:33.860]   you can make anybody look like an idiot.
[00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:35.260]   Trust me, I know.
[00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.940]   So I wouldn't credit anything you saw out of this.
[00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.700]   There's always been this thought that, you know,
[00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.180]   I bet they edited out all the parts where
[00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:48.740]   the Donald is screaming at people and using racial epithets.
[00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.820]   And maybe they did.
[00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.260]   But even if they didn't, you could still
[00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:53.340]   make him look like a fool.
[00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:54.500]   So I don't know.
[00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:56.740]   Yeah, I hope Jeff's a little more busy than that.
[00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:58.540]   But we shall see.
[00:07:58.540 --> 00:07:59.260]   Do you think--
[00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:00.780]   He's--
[00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:02.260]   Sorry, go ahead.
[00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.780]   Oh, I was just saying he's stepping down and CEO of Amazon.
[00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:05.280]   That's right.
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:05.980]   That's the other picture.
[00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:06.980]   That's the July 5th.
[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:07.480]   He announced it.
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.540]   Andy Jassy will take over July 5th.
[00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:12.220]   But see, that leaves him some extra time
[00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:13.780]   to go through the tapes.
[00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:15.580]   It's true.
[00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:18.940]   Doesn't it feel to you like Jeff, at least in recent years,
[00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:22.180]   is more interested in the Hollywood stuff anyway?
[00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:24.160]   I feel like handing things over to Jassy
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.660]   is the day to day so that he can continue his burgeoning--
[00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:30.700]   His Hollywood mogul lifestyle, you know.
[00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:35.540]   Yeah, well, his new girlfriend is a TV star.
[00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:37.660]   I mean, it does seem like he's--
[00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:40.300]   To a helicopter pilot, he's taken back
[00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:42.180]   to the skies again in helicopters
[00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:46.980]   despite being in that terrible accident in the early 2000s,
[00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:48.500]   where he almost died in one.
[00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:48.980]   Oh, you never get--
[00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.300]   He's got a lot of things in his play.
[00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.220]   You'll never get me in a helicopter.
[00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:53.380]   Helicopter-- though, I have to say,
[00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:55.820]   it's generally rich people that die in helicopter accidents.
[00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.020]   I'm just noticing.
[00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:00.700]   So I'm not wealthy enough to take a helicopter anywhere.
[00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:02.460]   Do they still offer for a while?
[00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.180]   Uber was offering helicopter rides
[00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:05.540]   to the Manhattan from the airport.
[00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:07.540]   OK, wait, hold on.
[00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:09.660]   I know this is a local story again,
[00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:13.180]   but it is currently cheaper to take--
[00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:16.380]   I think it's Blade or whatever the non-uber one--
[00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:20.140]   from JFK, take their helicopter from JFK to Manhattan
[00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:22.900]   than it is to take an Uber from JFK to Manhattan
[00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.420]   because all the Uber surge pricing has been insanely.
[00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:26.820]   Wow.
[00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:28.020]   Uber and the prices.
[00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.740]   They've lost a lot of drivers.
[00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:32.140]   Yeah, they've lost a lot of drivers,
[00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:34.820]   and they've been raising prices because they need to someday
[00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:36.220]   maybe make money.
[00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:39.740]   And at least in Brooklyn and New York,
[00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:42.460]   it is like 30 bucks to go a couple of miles.
[00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:43.980]   Is that the same where you guys live?
[00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:45.300]   Is it the same Petaluma?
[00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:47.140]   30 mucks on an Uber?
[00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:47.660]   Yeah.
[00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:48.140]   No.
[00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:48.980]   Let's go a couple of miles.
[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:50.460]   No, I don't think so.
[00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:51.380]   No.
[00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:52.220]   That's that surge price.
[00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:56.260]   I haven't seen in one for a year and a half, so I don't know.
[00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:59.220]   My daughter spends about 1,000 bucks a month on Lyft.
[00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:03.300]   I don't know if that's your name or not.
[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:04.300]   Yeah, I think Lyft is got the same.
[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:05.300]   I'll get cheaper in her car insurance.
[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:07.900]   It was exactly why she takes Lyft
[00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:09.380]   because I'm not buying her another car
[00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.180]   and paying for the car insurance.
[00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.460]   So she likes Lyft.
[00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.220]   I guess if you wear a mask, it's OK.
[00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:15.540]   I don't know.
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:16.940]   It makes me nervous.
[00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:18.540]   Taxis are cheaper, though.
[00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:21.220]   Are taxis cheaper in New York?
[00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:23.700]   Yeah, taxis are a lot cheaper now.
[00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.820]   I've downloaded taxiaps.
[00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:26.860]   And taxis-- oh, yeah.
[00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:28.460]   Taxi makes money.
[00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:30.380]   Uber loses money on every ride, so I
[00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.180]   don't understand how this all works.
[00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:37.540]   There's some new co-op thing that I just downloaded recently.
[00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:38.940]   I mean, people have been saying this
[00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:39.820]   should happen for years.
[00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:40.900]   Co-op ride.
[00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:42.740]   I haven't had a chance to try it because, again,
[00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:44.900]   I haven't done an Uber or Lyft in a year, too.
[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:48.860]   But I feel like, Paris, have you been in New York as long as I
[00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:51.260]   have-- I feel like it took Uber such a long time
[00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:53.700]   to get popular here because taxis were always cheaper.
[00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.020]   Like, we didn't need it.
[00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:59.220]   Yeah, I think the thing that eventually tip
[00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:01.700]   the needle is the convenience of being able to hail it
[00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:04.620]   anywhere or in different boroughs where maybe taxis weren't
[00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:05.820]   coming as often.
[00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:09.460]   But now it's kind of starting to tilt its way back a little bit.
[00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:12.100]   I mean, obviously, Uber and Lyft are still really
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.180]   dominant forms of transportation.
[00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.740]   But the prices I've seen, I don't know,
[00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.380]   complaints on the Reddit New York City forums
[00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:21.620]   or from random people on Twitter, just
[00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:24.620]   that the prices for both of the apps have gone so high
[00:11:24.620 --> 00:11:26.500]   that people are going back to taxis.
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.420]   This is the New York Times from yesterday.
[00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:31.340]   Prepare to pay more for Uber and Lyft rides.
[00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:32.740]   Companies say they're charging extra
[00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:34.860]   because they don't have enough drivers
[00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.700]   to match the rebounding demand.
[00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:39.940]   So they lost drivers during pandemic.
[00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:41.300]   Yeah, I mean, I think a lot of people
[00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:45.420]   didn't feel comfortable driving.
[00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:47.460]   And the surge is how much?
[00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:49.540]   I mean, according to the Times, they're
[00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:53.860]   saying a 37% higher in March than it was a year ago.
[00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:57.780]   In April, the cost was up 40% over year over year.
[00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:01.700]   Some surges as much as 50%.
[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:02.540]   Yeah, my--
[00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:06.140]   I think it's capped at 10 times whatever the base fare is.
[00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:07.980]   10 times?
[00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:08.500]   Yeah.
[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:09.420]   That used to be more.
[00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:10.380]   That was in percent.
[00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:11.100]   Holy cow.
[00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:12.380]   It used to be more.
[00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:16.100]   But a few years ago, they capped it at 10x.
[00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:20.460]   I mean, most surges are not the full, the maximum amount.
[00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:22.540]   But it's still pretty substantial.
[00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:25.260]   It can be really substantial, especially
[00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:30.180]   if it's during rush hour or bad weather on a rainy day
[00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:33.540]   when people don't want to be standing outside,
[00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:35.780]   trying to hail a cab.
[00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:40.260]   The surge prices for Uber and Lyft can be really high.
[00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:40.780]   So--
[00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:44.420]   Yeah, right now, for instance, I'm in Brooklyn
[00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:48.580]   to get a Uber to drive me three miles to one world trade
[00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:53.060]   center would be $30 for a new Brex, just a basic one.
[00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:53.660]   Wow.
[00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:55.940]   You could probably walk it faster, too.
[00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:57.260]   Probably.
[00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:58.860]   Not now, maybe, because of Memorial Day,
[00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:01.060]   but most of the time.
[00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:03.020]   So it's funny because this pandemic,
[00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:04.820]   the one another blessing from the pandemic,
[00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:08.460]   we haven't had to talk about Uber and Lyft much in the last year.
[00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:12.220]   I guess we'll be talking about them again.
[00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:16.860]   California, they passed Prop 22, which said that these people
[00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:18.420]   are employees.
[00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:20.820]   I'm sure Uber is fighting that in court.
[00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:24.540]   But I imagine coast to coast, there's
[00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:25.740]   movements in that direction.
[00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:31.340]   Uber already loses something like 40% on every ride
[00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:35.540]   because they have to pay the employees, the contract employees,
[00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:38.060]   having to give them benefits, too, probably would make it even
[00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:39.100]   more expensive.
[00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:41.300]   I wonder if Uber is even tenable.
[00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:44.300]   Sam, is Uber designed around self-driving vehicles
[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:46.420]   not around drivers?
[00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:50.500]   It was not originally.
[00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:54.540]   When they started it in 2009, 2010, whenever it really got kicked off
[00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:59.260]   in San Francisco, the whole premise of self-driving vehicles
[00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.780]   was still so far off into the future.
[00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:03.900]   Nobody was really seeing it at that point
[00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:06.140]   as a realistic near-term proposition.
[00:14:06.140 --> 00:14:11.020]   It wasn't until about 2014 or so after Google
[00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:15.340]   started posting videos of their prototype vehicles running
[00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:18.700]   around and others started jumping into the space,
[00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:23.500]   that was around the time that Travis Kalanik came up and said,
[00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.660]   this is an existential threat to our business.
[00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:30.020]   But the problem for a company like Uber or Lyft
[00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:33.900]   is automated vehicles don't necessarily make their business
[00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:38.340]   any better because today they don't own any of those assets.
[00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:39.420]   They don't own the vehicles.
[00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:41.540]   They don't have to ensure them or put fuel in them
[00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:42.660]   or maintain them.
[00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:44.780]   They're just paying the drivers.
[00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:49.980]   And if they try to have their own fleet of automated vehicles,
[00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:52.300]   their own fleet of robo-taxis, now they've
[00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:53.700]   got all those assets.
[00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:55.740]   They're going to be spending many billions of dollars
[00:14:55.740 --> 00:15:00.380]   a year on buying and maintaining and fueling vehicles.
[00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:03.020]   And there's other kinds of costs.
[00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:04.580]   There's new costs that are associated with it.
[00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:06.900]   So just eliminating the cost of drivers
[00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:10.140]   does not necessarily get them to profitability.
[00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:15.220]   So I think-- and this is why Uber sold off their ATG group,
[00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:18.140]   their Advanced Technology Group, and Lyft sold off
[00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:21.500]   their Level 5 group that was developing automated vehicles.
[00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.260]   And they're just going to partner with the companies
[00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.660]   that are developing this technology and the automakers
[00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:29.580]   and say, bring your vehicles to our platform,
[00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:32.140]   just like drivers bring their vehicles to the platform
[00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:33.140]   today.
[00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:36.340]   And I'm not sure if the economics necessarily
[00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:40.660]   get any better for Uber and Lyft in that kind of scenario.
[00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:43.780]   Last quarter, Uber lost $108 million.
[00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:45.900]   But it would have been a lot more if they hadn't sold
[00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:49.100]   the Advanced Technology Group for $1.6 billion.
[00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:52.460]   It would have been significantly larger.
[00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:54.460]   They've never made any money.
[00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:56.020]   You really have to-- I mean, they're basically
[00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:59.220]   funded by the investors who keep pumping money into Uber.
[00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:04.300]   You really have to wonder how long they can keep this up.
[00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:09.220]   They actually have done better, especially over the past year.
[00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:11.700]   They've had a lot of growth in the delivery business.
[00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:14.420]   Uber eats and the other delivery stuff.
[00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:15.300]   They have to eat stuff.
[00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:16.860]   We're sledding them by Postmates.
[00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:17.860]   Postmates.
[00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:19.420]   Yeah, they bought Postmates.
[00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:22.060]   And so between Uber and DoorDash now,
[00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:25.100]   they're kind of the two big dominant players in deliveries
[00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:25.780]   now.
[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:29.620]   And the economics of that actually work out a lot better
[00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:32.460]   for them than ride hailing.
[00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:36.500]   In the past four weeks, more than 100,000 drivers
[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.460]   have returned to the Uber platform according to the New
[00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:39.020]   York Times.
[00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:40.780]   That's because they put 200--
[00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:43.980]   remember, this is a company that lost $100 million last quarter.
[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:46.780]   They put $250 million.
[00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:48.660]   They called it stimulus spending into the effort
[00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:49.540]   to recruit drivers.
[00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:52.740]   Lyft spent $100 million.
[00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:54.700]   Paris, this is the modern world.
[00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:57.980]   You spend money and lose money.
[00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:58.940]   Do not make money, yeah.
[00:16:58.940 --> 00:16:59.860]   Do not make money.
[00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:02.780]   I don't understand this at all.
[00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:07.380]   Well, the other fundamental problem with their business,
[00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:11.340]   because it's largely unregulated--
[00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:13.860]   I think that's a change, by the way.
[00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:18.940]   But the nature of what they do, having a dispatch platform,
[00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:22.820]   is there's not a real high barrier to entry for that.
[00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:27.980]   So pretty much anybody can replicate what they have done.
[00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:30.340]   And then it's just a matter of attracting drivers.
[00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:34.340]   So because it's asset-like, you can come in,
[00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:37.140]   you can build the dispatch platform
[00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:39.980]   and start recruiting drivers.
[00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:42.420]   And if you're willing to undercut,
[00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:45.140]   if you've got enough cash, that you can undercut the pricing.
[00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:47.420]   So there's always a race to the bottom on the pricing
[00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:48.900]   for the consumer side.
[00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:51.620]   And for consumers, there's no network effect,
[00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:54.420]   because there's no switching costs to go from Uber to Lyft
[00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:56.460]   or to any other service.
[00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:59.820]   So they have to keep their prices artificially low.
[00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:00.820]   Or taxi to--
[00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:02.180]   Or city bikes.
[00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:03.380]   I mean, there's always--
[00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:03.820]   Yeah.
[00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:06.660]   The Times quotes a hospitality worker in New York
[00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:11.380]   who used to pay $20 for Uber rides to Brooklyn from Queens.
[00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:13.020]   The fare is now $38.
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:15.860]   A trip to the Bronx $45.
[00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:18.100]   Ms. Sanchez recently realized airfare is when
[00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:20.620]   nearly the same price as her Uber rides.
[00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:23.340]   When she found a $60 round trip flight to Miami,
[00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:23.980]   she booked that.
[00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:26.540]   If my choice is to go to the Bronx or Miami,
[00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:27.580]   I'm going to Miami.
[00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:28.580]   She said--
[00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:29.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:30.780]   She was reasonable.
[00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:32.780]   Yeah.
[00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:33.100]   So--
[00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:35.180]   Seems to be the VC mentality.
[00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:37.740]   The chat room is saying--
[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:40.100]   Fopon, the chat room, is saying, Paris,
[00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:41.700]   that this is the Amazon model.
[00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.340]   Amazon historically didn't make money.
[00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:45.340]   They invested it back into the business,
[00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:48.140]   built the fulfillment centers, and now they're
[00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:49.500]   extremely profitable.
[00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:52.820]   Can you compare this to Amazon, you think, Paris?
[00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:56.180]   I mean, I think it's a little different for the reasons
[00:18:56.180 --> 00:19:00.380]   we just discussed about Amazon part of what eventually
[00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:03.900]   ended up working at scale was their physical assets,
[00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:07.500]   their fulfillment center network, the way
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:11.300]   that their system worked in the physical world.
[00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:12.780]   Uber and Littrally don't have that.
[00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:14.620]   I mean, they are incredibly asset-lightened.
[00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:17.860]   The only thing they have is this technology platform that
[00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:21.300]   allows them to connect to a supply of drivers that
[00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:24.100]   can easily evaporate as we're seeing right now
[00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:29.180]   and cause all of these issues in regards to accessibility
[00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:33.860]   and keeping the cost down for customers at least.
[00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:35.460]   And I think it's also worth mentioning
[00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:38.420]   that Amazon is having its own version of this issue
[00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:43.260]   in regards to Amazon Flex drivers and the delivery
[00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:47.060]   drivers that they use in states like California as well,
[00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:50.620]   given that AB5 is a current lander question for them.
[00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:51.620]   Right, right.
[00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:53.900]   They also pay these employees employees.
[00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:54.700]   Go ahead, Differ.
[00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:55.820]   It's important to say that there's
[00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:57.700]   a difference, Leo, between a company that
[00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:00.580]   wasn't profitable for years because it chose not to be.
[00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:02.740]   I don't think that Uber and Lyft have that luxury
[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:05.420]   to choose not to be profitable.
[00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:08.220]   They would love to eke out a little bit.
[00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:09.580]   Right, right, right.
[00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:13.260]   I've also been hearing a lot of people say recently that,
[00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:15.780]   you know, we talk about bubbles and things
[00:20:15.780 --> 00:20:17.220]   like that in the tech economy all the time,
[00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:20.100]   but what if, for the last decade or so, there
[00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:23.020]   is a bubble in the labor market that allowed all of these gig
[00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:25.620]   economy startups to happen?
[00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:28.860]   And that now, if you do go into a roaring 20s period
[00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:32.300]   where, again, maybe people can be
[00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:34.580]   choosy about the jobs they take, maybe there
[00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:37.260]   is inflationary pressure, increasing wages,
[00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:40.220]   and things like that, that suddenly these gig economy
[00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:44.860]   models don't work out, maybe at all?
[00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:46.380]   That's a really good point.
[00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:49.460]   You know, both my kids graduated from college
[00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:51.380]   in the last few years.
[00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:55.220]   And both of them entered what is essentially a gig economy.
[00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:56.780]   You know, when I got out of college,
[00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:59.140]   you had recruitment, you know, you had people on campus
[00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:00.020]   trying to recruit you.
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:03.060]   The idea was you get a job, you have a job for life,
[00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:05.580]   you retire with a gold watch.
[00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:07.380]   That has really changed.
[00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:09.620]   And it is now the expectation of a lot of young people
[00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:11.900]   that you're not going to ever have a lifetime job.
[00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:13.940]   You might not even have a job job.
[00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:17.540]   You might just have a bunch of gigs.
[00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:20.540]   Yeah, that's increasingly common.
[00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:24.940]   It's been so un-satisfying and unsustainable.
[00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:25.980]   Or maybe that's just me.
[00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:27.780]   I think it is.
[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:33.260]   And I think until wages actually start rising,
[00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:34.740]   so that people--
[00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:37.420]   I mean, we've seen this in restaurants in recent months
[00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:38.020]   as well.
[00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:40.420]   Restaurants are having a hard time finding people
[00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:43.380]   to come back to work because they
[00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:48.180]   pay so poorly in most of the country.
[00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:51.420]   The base wage for restaurant workers
[00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:54.980]   is well below the regular minimum wage.
[00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:56.820]   It's like $2 or $3 an hour.
[00:21:56.820 --> 00:22:00.300]   And then most of their income comes from tips,
[00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:03.260]   which is a crazy system.
[00:22:03.260 --> 00:22:06.460]   And until wages actually start rising,
[00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:08.580]   then people will come back into the workforce.
[00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:13.020]   Who wants to work for wages where you can't make a living?
[00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:16.820]   Yeah, I mean, in some places, you're earning $4 an hour
[00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:20.780]   as a waitress or waiter or another tipped employee.
[00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:24.540]   And if you don't have enough people coming in and choosing
[00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:29.020]   to tip you, you end up making very, very little
[00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:31.940]   for your time on the job.
[00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:32.780]   That bothers me.
[00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:33.380]   That worries me.
[00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:38.060]   I feel like that's a recipe for some kind of disaster.
[00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:40.020]   I'm not sure what.
[00:22:40.020 --> 00:22:42.380]   But there's going to be a whole generation that's
[00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:46.660]   just going to be underemployed and impoverished.
[00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:49.420]   You don't want to generate a growth impoverished.
[00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:53.180]   I mean, what we're maybe seeing the beginning of the vanguard
[00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:56.660]   of is what we're describing is that Uber and Lyft are having
[00:22:56.660 --> 00:23:01.540]   to shove money at people to get drivers onto the job.
[00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:06.140]   Amazon is having to increase their hourly wages.
[00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:10.660]   So what if we are seeing the tip of the spear in terms
[00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:14.500]   of, well, this next decade is going to be about,
[00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:18.260]   you're not going to find a lot of people that are going
[00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:22.780]   to do a door dash thing or do any of these gig economy things
[00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:25.780]   because maybe there are better jobs out there.
[00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:28.740]   Like maybe tech is sort of the canary in the coal mine
[00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:32.100]   for this, that we are going to see the wages increase.
[00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:34.100]   There are better jobs available to people,
[00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:38.740]   whereas in the teens, the job market
[00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:42.180]   was so weak that people had to take these side.
[00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:43.740]   I think you make a great point.
[00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:44.900]   Yeah.
[00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:48.020]   They forced us in this situation, the bad economy.
[00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:49.420]   But there's a McDonald's in Illinois
[00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:51.780]   that's so desperate to hire people.
[00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:54.220]   They're giving you an iPhone if you take the job
[00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:57.060]   and stay for six months.
[00:23:57.060 --> 00:23:57.700]   Free iPhone.
[00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:00.500]   You would never put that money towards increasing their wages
[00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:00.500]   too much.
[00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:01.100]   Oh, no, no.
[00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:01.600]   No.
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:03.540]   No.
[00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:07.540]   And actually, I was looking back as I started my career
[00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:12.100]   50 years ago working at McDonald's in Santa Cruz.
[00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:13.940]   And the minimum wage then, I don't know what it was,
[00:24:13.940 --> 00:24:16.500]   I was making, I think, 350 an hour.
[00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:20.660]   But 350 an hour in the early '70s was more than 15 bucks
[00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:23.340]   an hour today.
[00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:24.820]   I think if I did the math right.
[00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:28.220]   So even though that seemed like a very small amount of money,
[00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:29.580]   actually, it wasn't bad pay.
[00:24:29.580 --> 00:24:31.380]   It was more than people working at McDonald's
[00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:34.140]   make today in real dollars.
[00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:35.940]   No wonder they have to give them an iPhone.
[00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:37.100]   But it seems like a scam.
[00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:41.060]   It's like the same thing as Uber and Lyft offering cash bonuses
[00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:42.740]   to sign up in the long run.
[00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:43.980]   If the job's not tenable--
[00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:47.180]   Those Amazon ads, they're all the time with $1,000 cash
[00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:48.660]   bonus to start.
[00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:49.460]   I've seen ads--
[00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:50.860]   You can also just pay them a bit more.
[00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:54.380]   I've seen ads from Amazon now saying, hey, we pay $15.
[00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:57.380]   Full page ads and newspapers and on TV saying,
[00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:58.100]   it's a good job.
[00:24:58.100 --> 00:24:59.500]   What are you talking about?
[00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:01.700]   It does actually compare to some of the other jobs,
[00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:03.220]   seem like a decent job.
[00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:03.780]   It sounds like--
[00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:06.340]   Except for when you look at the numbers
[00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:08.780]   that in comparison to any other job in warehousing
[00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:12.620]   or manufacturing, Amazon has a much higher injury rate,
[00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:18.260]   especially warehouses that are robotic enabled, which
[00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:20.780]   is the increasing share of Amazon warehouses.
[00:25:20.780 --> 00:25:22.260]   Yeah.
[00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:26.460]   Yeah, my kid, my younger child and her partner
[00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:31.300]   both worked in the Amazon warehouse through most of 2020,
[00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:34.420]   both ended up quitting after the holidays.
[00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:36.340]   Because it's really hard work.
[00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:36.860]   It's grueling.
[00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:37.540]   Really dangerous.
[00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:38.620]   I mean, they did it because--
[00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:40.340]   Especially if the holidays, you have to work with--
[00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:40.340]   Ton of over--
[00:25:40.340 --> 00:25:41.940]   --a thousand hour shifts.
[00:25:41.940 --> 00:25:42.420]   Yeah.
[00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:43.860]   I mean, they were getting a ton of overtime.
[00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:47.260]   So they made decent money, but it's really challenging.
[00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:50.660]   You've heard the stories about people not having enough break
[00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:51.180]   time.
[00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:56.660]   They've got to pee in their water bottles and things like that.
[00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:58.740]   I mean, now I think one of the stories on the rundown
[00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:02.100]   is about these little pods that are putting into the warehouses
[00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:04.620]   now, which seems common to kill.
[00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:07.460]   They're called Amazon Zen Rooms.
[00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:08.460]   Zen Booth.
[00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:09.580]   Zen Booth.
[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:11.260]   Welcome to my Zen Booth.
[00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:14.620]   It's a tiny little rectangular--
[00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:15.620]   It's a phone booth.
[00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:16.340]   --window windows.
[00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:18.300]   It's a phone booth.
[00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:21.660]   Depressing is all hack inside, and you're
[00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:23.740]   supposed to be able to go in there to be mindful.
[00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:25.740]   That's a timeout.
[00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:29.940]   He almost reminds me of the suicide booths in Teterama.
[00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:30.740]   Oh my god.
[00:26:31.060 --> 00:26:37.460]   Vice motherboard advice writes, what this looks like in reality
[00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:41.260]   is a coffin-sized booth in the middle of a warehouse
[00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:45.020]   where workers can use a computer to view mental health
[00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:47.500]   and mindful practices.
[00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:49.740]   Here's the video.
[00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:53.180]   I wanted to provide a place that's quiet, that people could go
[00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:57.260]   and focus on their mental and emotional wealth.
[00:26:57.260 --> 00:26:58.820]   Oh my god.
[00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:01.780]   It's got padded walls as it should.
[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:05.620]   You can navigate through a library of mental health
[00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:06.020]   and--
[00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:09.260]   Oh, barely big enough to sit in and look at the computer.
[00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:11.100]   That's so dystopian.
[00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:13.020]   It looks like you're having a lot of fun in there.
[00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:15.580]   I'm sure that you cannot get a break to use it,
[00:27:15.580 --> 00:27:18.020]   so you could probably use it after your workout.
[00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:20.820]   Right, that's the point is that if you already
[00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:23.300]   are having a hard time using the bathroom
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:25.420]   and the breaks that they allow you,
[00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:27.900]   how is that a choice if it's like you can go pee
[00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:29.820]   or you can go sit in this coffin?
[00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:31.820]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:33.620]   Don't pee in the coffin, though.
[00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:35.180]   That's right out.
[00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:36.540]   I think the employees--
[00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:38.140]   They should just start a lefty water pod.
[00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:40.820]   Just a little hole in the coffin, yeah.
[00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:44.420]   Yeah, have more toilets, more restrooms
[00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:46.380]   around the warehouse.
[00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:47.860]   Skip these pods.
[00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:49.420]   So there is a lawsuit.
[00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:51.380]   Attorney General of the District of Columbia
[00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:55.060]   is suing Amazon on antitrust grounds.
[00:27:55.060 --> 00:28:01.300]   Oddly, they say he says that Amazon's overcharging.
[00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:05.460]   And then the Biden White House says Amazon is undercharging.
[00:28:05.460 --> 00:28:06.620]   So that's confusing.
[00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:12.020]   So no, specifically what the DC Attorney General is accusing
[00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:16.780]   Amazon of is that there is this provision or was in Amazon
[00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:20.140]   kind of terms of service for sellers, the companies that
[00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:22.820]   are selling things in Amazon, where you can't list a product
[00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:26.820]   on Amazon unless if you have a product listed on Amazon,
[00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:29.900]   you can't sell it for less on any other website.
[00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:31.380]   Even if it's your own website.
[00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:36.300]   As a consumer, seems like a pro-consumer provision.
[00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:38.500]   I know it's somehow violating treasure presses.
[00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:40.500]   But if you're selling a t-shirt, Leo,
[00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:42.460]   and you also want to list it on Amazon,
[00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:46.740]   your t-shirt on the Twit website has to be higher in order
[00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:49.500]   for you to have $2 more.
[00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:50.460]   Oh, it can't be the same.
[00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:52.740]   It has to be a little more expensive.
[00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:56.860]   Isn't that what Apple got posted for with the bookstore?
[00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:58.500]   Yes, exactly.
[00:28:58.500 --> 00:28:59.900]   It's exactly the same thing.
[00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:01.380]   They were doing the same thing to Amazon.
[00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:05.860]   Apparently somebody told Amazon this was illegal.
[00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:07.660]   So they stopped doing it in 2019.
[00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:10.020]   They called it Price Parity Provision.
[00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:13.020]   I could see how somebody, maybe like me, not schooled
[00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:15.740]   in the ins and outs of antitrust law might say,
[00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:20.380]   well, I mean, we, like when advertisers give a coupon code
[00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:23.620]   to our audience, we try to tell them, okay,
[00:29:23.620 --> 00:29:26.700]   but don't offer a cheaper code anywhere else
[00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:29.140]   because people just use that.
[00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:32.740]   And then you'll think that they're not seeing the ad.
[00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:33.820]   I mean, you can't stop them.
[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:36.580]   We don't put a provision in our contracts like that.
[00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:39.780]   But I can understand how business in a naive way
[00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:41.580]   might say, well, that's a good thing both for us
[00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:42.660]   and for the customer, right?
[00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:44.860]   The customer's getting knows when they buy it on Amazon,
[00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:46.220]   they're getting the lowest price out there,
[00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:47.060]   or at least nothing.
[00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:51.020]   That's, Leo, that's how this thinking of antitrust
[00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:53.540]   right now is evolving or has been involving in recent years
[00:29:53.540 --> 00:29:56.060]   where the yardstick was always like, well,
[00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:57.380]   it's not raising prices.
[00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:00.380]   It's cheaper for consumers so consumers are benefiting.
[00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:01.220]   Right.
[00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:04.020]   But the problem is is that, and this is the thinking
[00:30:04.020 --> 00:30:07.220]   that has evolved, and I'm not in this field,
[00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:10.300]   so I might butcher this, but when you have these platforms
[00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:14.060]   that are also serving as the marketplaces,
[00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:17.860]   then you can't just use the measurement of lower prices
[00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:21.220]   as the harm, because there's also harm being done
[00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:24.700]   to the overall marketplace itself, as Paris is saying,
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:27.100]   that where it is harming the consumer,
[00:30:27.100 --> 00:30:29.380]   even if we use price as a mechanism,
[00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:31.500]   that you can't get it cheaper elsewhere,
[00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.900]   because what's happening is that you, Leo,
[00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:37.540]   selling your Twit T-shirt, you're going to the Amazon
[00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:41.380]   marketplace to get scale and maybe have some logistics help
[00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:42.220]   and stuff like that.
[00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:44.180]   It would be cheaper for you to just sell it
[00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:45.780]   on your own website too.
[00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:48.460]   But then I have to use my own fulfillment
[00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:50.020]   and all of that, right?
[00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:52.300]   But you're not going to cut to Amazon.
[00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:52.780]   Right.
[00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:55.220]   Right, and so the point is, is that you're being locked
[00:30:55.220 --> 00:31:01.220]   into a distorted marketplace that Amazon is creating, right?
[00:31:01.220 --> 00:31:02.220]   Got it.
[00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:05.060]   It's just like people like Amazon,
[00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:07.340]   when it sells books in the Kindle store
[00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:09.180]   versus selling them on Apple's platform.
[00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:10.340]   In fact, it's not at all unusual.
[00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:13.580]   Spotify charges 30% less if you buy a subscription
[00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:16.340]   from Spotify than from Apple,
[00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:18.580]   because they're paying the Apple Vig,
[00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:21.660]   so in effect the customer pays the Apple Vig.
[00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:24.820]   So it would be like Apple saying to Spotify,
[00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:28.340]   yeah, but you can't charge less on your website.
[00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:30.740]   Right, that's the exact argument that I say
[00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:33.260]   is evolving in terms of this sort of regulatory thing.
[00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:34.860]   Right.
[00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:37.260]   By the way, Amazon's response,
[00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:39.340]   the DC Attorney General has it exactly
[00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:42.660]   backwards sellers set their own prices for products
[00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:43.540]   they offer in our store.
[00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:45.180]   Nobody said they didn't.
[00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:48.540]   Amazon takes pride in the fact that we offer low prices
[00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:51.340]   across the broadest selection, and like any store,
[00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:53.900]   we reserve the right not to highlight offers.
[00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:57.300]   This, by the way, this is how Amazon changed it in 2019.
[00:31:57.300 --> 00:32:01.020]   There are sanctions imposed if you offer it at a lower price.
[00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:03.260]   And basically what Amazon's saying is,
[00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:05.300]   we don't highlight offers to customers
[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:06.860]   that are not priced competitively.
[00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:09.860]   So if I'm selling an air conditioner at my website
[00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:13.620]   for 150 bucks, but I'm selling it for 190 bucks on Amazon,
[00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:15.540]   they won't highlight it anymore.
[00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:17.060]   They don't prevent me from doing it.
[00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:20.700]   Which, by the way, is their biggest growth area of business
[00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:23.780]   is suddenly turning the switch on this ad network
[00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:27.420]   that is suddenly the third largest ad business
[00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:29.300]   in digital behind Google and Google.
[00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:33.140]   Huge growth and the fastest growing ad business anywhere, right?
[00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:34.620]   Amazing growth.
[00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:37.540]   So isn't that funny how this pivot kind of also
[00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:39.260]   leans into their current strength?
[00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:41.820]   Amazon says the relief the Attorney General seeks
[00:32:41.820 --> 00:32:45.500]   would force Amazon to feature higher prices to customers,
[00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:48.540]   that $195 air conditioner.
[00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:51.740]   Oddly going against the core objectives of antitrust law.
[00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:53.980]   So I think you're exactly, as you said, Brian,
[00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:59.060]   this is perhaps a re-understanding revision
[00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:00.620]   of what antitrust means.
[00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:05.100]   Well, historically, any trust could be against,
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:08.060]   could be to promote competition between companies,
[00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:11.860]   or as it has traditionally been in the United States,
[00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:14.860]   or as it's traditionally been in Europe, as I understand,
[00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:18.140]   to promote competition, because for consumers,
[00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:20.020]   price competition for consumers.
[00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:21.100]   It's the other way around.
[00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:21.940]   It's the other way around.
[00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:23.820]   We prefer for consumers here.
[00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:24.500]   Okay.
[00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:28.020]   And then promoting competition in Europe.
[00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:33.020]   So that either way, the ultimate goal is to encourage,
[00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:36.220]   you know, competition, innovation,
[00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:37.900]   and ultimately that benefits consumers.
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:39.220]   So.
[00:33:39.220 --> 00:33:41.580]   Well, except I think in the long term,
[00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:44.100]   the approach of promoting competition,
[00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:46.500]   having a vibrant marketplace,
[00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:49.180]   long term is going to be better for consumers.
[00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:52.980]   If you have multiple players, you know, that are competing,
[00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:57.980]   whereas, you know, if you allow, you know, one company to,
[00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:00.420]   you know, have a race to the bottom here, you know,
[00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:02.900]   and they happen to be the one that's got enough resources
[00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:05.300]   to survive that race to the bottom,
[00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:07.740]   and they drive everybody else out of business,
[00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:10.700]   then you end up with a monopoly situation.
[00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:15.380]   And while the lower prices may be great temporarily,
[00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:17.580]   long term, they're probably not going to stay that way
[00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:20.980]   once they drive all their competitors out of the market.
[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:21.820]   Right.
[00:34:21.820 --> 00:34:23.260]   And it's the same thing we were just talking about,
[00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:24.580]   Uber and Lyft almost.
[00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:26.940]   I mean, their whole business model is predicated
[00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:28.860]   in the fact that we want to capture all the market share
[00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:32.660]   with our lower artificially deflated costs,
[00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:36.780]   and then raise them up so that we can make a profit.
[00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:38.900]   But in Amazon's case, it's such a large company
[00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:41.180]   that it is subsidizing the cost of its products.
[00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:44.180]   We're talking about first party brands with AWS
[00:34:44.180 --> 00:34:46.220]   and other profit making arms.
[00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:49.860]   And eventually, you'd assume, would kind of bring
[00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:51.700]   all of these parts of the business into alignment
[00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:54.740]   to all be profit generating in and of themselves.
[00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:56.820]   It's a problem politically though, isn't it?
[00:34:56.820 --> 00:35:01.060]   Because customers like Amazon, customers like Uber.
[00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:03.420]   They like Lyft, no, they don't.
[00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:05.020]   They always think, yeah, they do.
[00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:06.460]   So politically, it's challenging.
[00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:09.980]   It's the same problem that neutrality had.
[00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:14.860]   It's hard to explain why a zero rating Netflix
[00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:19.540]   on your T-Mobile account is bad for the country
[00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:21.820]   when it's so good for me as a consumer,
[00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:24.140]   I don't have to pay for bandwidth for Netflix.
[00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:26.100]   What's wrong with that?
[00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:28.820]   And we've tried to jump through these hoops explaining,
[00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:30.820]   well then the next Netflix doesn't start
[00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:32.660]   because they have a disadvantage.
[00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:34.740]   But I don't think it's consumers just go,
[00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:36.100]   oh, this screw that.
[00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:37.580]   I don't want to pay for Netflix.
[00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:39.340]   I like Amazon.
[00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:41.620]   I don't want to have to, I like Uber
[00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:43.220]   unless they do surge pricing
[00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:44.660]   and I don't like Uber anymore.
[00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:48.540]   Consumers tend to think about it in the short term.
[00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:50.580]   How much is it going to cost me
[00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:52.420]   for the thing I want to buy today?
[00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:54.540]   Because they're not thinking about five years from now.
[00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:58.140]   But, and I agreed and I suppose Congress should be
[00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:01.020]   except Congress has to get elected
[00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:02.460]   and they have to appeal to voters.
[00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:03.940]   And if voters are saying,
[00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:06.740]   in a loud voice, stop screwing around with Amazon.
[00:36:06.740 --> 00:36:11.460]   How long before they stop screwing around with Amazon?
[00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:14.980]   These things can evolve to, in the sense that,
[00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:17.860]   here's a perfect example, using Amazon actually,
[00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:22.020]   but for how many years was sales tax not collected
[00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:24.420]   on e-commerce because the government did a forward
[00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:27.300]   thinking thing which was like, this is a nascent industry.
[00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:30.020]   Let's support it as much as we can.
[00:36:30.020 --> 00:36:34.260]   Now that e-commerce has become such a large percentage
[00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:37.900]   of all commerce, that's gone because it served its purpose
[00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:40.180]   and it doesn't need to continue in perpetuity.
[00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:43.260]   That was a change that was harmful to consumers
[00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:45.100]   if you're a heavy e-commerce user.
[00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:49.140]   But then probably better for the overall economy?
[00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:51.380]   Well, better for the tax collectors.
[00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:52.980]   Sure. (laughs)
[00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:56.300]   The states were really the ones who were bitching about this.
[00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:57.740]   Better for our roads.
[00:36:57.740 --> 00:36:59.620]   It's better, yeah, Ralph, you should drive around
[00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:00.460]   and pedal a little more.
[00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:01.620]   You're school. I don't know where that money's gone,
[00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:04.060]   but it's not going into the potholes in pedal a little more.
[00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:04.900]   Maybe it is.
[00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:06.300]   Well speaking of, you know the whole reason
[00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:10.060]   why Bezos abandoned that anti-sales tax thing
[00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:12.340]   was because there was a larger thing
[00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:13.820]   that he was going after which was,
[00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:15.820]   they couldn't put fulfillment centers
[00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:18.820]   and the employees couldn't even travel to states.
[00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:20.740]   They weren't collecting sales tax.
[00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:24.020]   So in aid of the larger land grab
[00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:25.900]   of building out everything, they're like,
[00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:27.860]   all right, we'll drop fighting this
[00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:30.100]   and sure, sales tax everywhere,
[00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:32.540]   but we can put warehouses and fulfill it.
[00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:37.620]   Yeah, they have a fulfillment center in our neighborhood.
[00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:41.100]   I ordered an echo last night at nine.
[00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:42.620]   It's already on my doorstep.
[00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:46.100]   Yeah, that's why we have one in two day shipping.
[00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:48.220]   Same day is because of those fulfillment centers
[00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:50.580]   and delivery stations and point nine.
[00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:54.180]   All right, I'm gonna give you all a challenge
[00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:57.460]   in just a second 'cause I think I have a contrarian view
[00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:00.140]   speaking of Amazon on Amazon sidewalk,
[00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:03.060]   Dan Gooden, Rightening and the R's Technica.
[00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:04.700]   What could possibly go wrong?
[00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:08.740]   Amazon devices will soon automatically share your internet
[00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:13.420]   with neighbors, Amazon experimental wireless mesh networking,
[00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:16.220]   turns users into guinea pigs.
[00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:18.260]   And he goes on to tell you how to turn it off.
[00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:19.340]   I think you should leave it on.
[00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:21.460]   We'll talk about that when we come back.
[00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:22.300]   It's great to have you.
[00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:22.900]   I have strong opinions.
[00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:23.940]   I'm sure you do.
[00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:26.300]   Paris Martin, no, from the information.
[00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:27.940]   Great to have you.
[00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:30.780]   When I told Jessica, you don't have to buy ads on Twitch.
[00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:32.900]   You just have Paris on more often.
[00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:33.740]   I have it to be.
[00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:35.100]   We love having Paris on.
[00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:37.660]   Brian McCulloch and the tech meme Ride Home.
[00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:41.060]   Great to have you, internet historian.
[00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:42.860]   I call you that 'cause of the internet history
[00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:44.740]   this day in internet history podcast.
[00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:45.460]   Do you still do that?
[00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:47.100]   I keep asking you this.
[00:38:47.100 --> 00:38:49.820]   Were you going to bring that back?
[00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:51.180]   Oh, he's muted.
[00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:53.220]   You're muted.
[00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:53.660]   Hello?
[00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:56.980]   Sorry, no, I haven't done it in two years now, but--
[00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:57.420]   I keep asking--
[00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:58.420]   I keep asking--
[00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:03.220]   Yeah, if somebody, you know, if somebody wants to sit down
[00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:04.180]   with me and their--
[00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:05.220]   Hey, you, yes.
[00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:06.500]   And they're very interesting.
[00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:07.500]   Yes.
[00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:08.660]   I would always take you interview Leele.
[00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:10.220]   Yeah.
[00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:11.620]   No, that's funny that you--
[00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:12.860]   That's kind of what I'm hinting at.
[00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:16.260]   But we can bring it out of mothballs for--
[00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:17.420]   For a special person.
[00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:20.460]   I did that the other day because we canceled our interview
[00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:23.380]   show "Tryingulation" due to lack of interest.
[00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:25.500]   But I really wanted to interview Andy Weir,
[00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:26.860]   the author of "The Martian."
[00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:28.100]   So I said, well, I'm going to bring it back
[00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:29.820]   for one special episode.
[00:39:29.820 --> 00:39:30.260]   There you go.
[00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:31.260]   That works out all right.
[00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:33.180]   Yeah, he's got a new book, which is really good
[00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:34.380]   if you haven't read it.
[00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:35.300]   Project Hail Mary.
[00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:39.980]   Also with this, my car guy, Sam Eble Samad from my guide
[00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:42.580]   has insights and the wheel bearings podcast.
[00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:44.620]   I do also want to talk-- you were talking before this show.
[00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:47.900]   I wasn't here, but I was listening in about Tesla
[00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:51.380]   abandoning radar in its car, self-driving vehicles
[00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:53.860]   in favor of cameras and how I want to talk about how
[00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:54.500]   that's working out.
[00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:59.780]   Plus the F-150, the Ford Electric truck, the lightning,
[00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:00.900]   was announced this.
[00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:01.620]   Was it this week?
[00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:03.340]   Yeah, this Wednesday.
[00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:04.020]   Week and a half ago.
[00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:05.180]   And you got to drive it.
[00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:06.180]   So I'm going to ask you a little--
[00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:07.060]   I get to ride in it.
[00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:10.420]   Nobody's no non-Ford employees have driven it.
[00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:15.780]   Oh, you just get to sit there as a passenger and look at it.
[00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:18.340]   Well, I will talk about that as well in just a little bit.
[00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:21.260]   Our show today brought to you by brand new sponsor.
[00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:25.620]   Indeed, you're the hiring expert for your company.

[00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:30.340]   your shortlist of quality candidates.

[00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:38.100]   You need, indeed, indeed is the job site that makes hiring
[00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:39.260]   as easy as one, two, three.
[00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:42.380]   You post, you screen, you interview,
[00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:45.380]   and you do it all on, indeed.
[00:40:45.380 --> 00:40:47.980]   You'll get a quality shortlist of candidates whose
[00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:51.100]   resumes on, indeed, match your job description faster.
[00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:53.540]   You only pay for the candidates that meet your must-have
[00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:56.220]   qualifications, and you schedule and complete video
[00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:58.260]   interviews in your Indeed dashboard.
[00:40:58.260 --> 00:40:59.700]   I love that dashboard.
[00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:02.860]   Indeed, makes connecting with and hiring the right talent
[00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:05.140]   fast and easy.
[00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:08.580]   Indeed's instant match gets you quality candidates whose
[00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:12.740]   resumes on, indeed, fit your job description immediately.
[00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:15.700]   Over 80% of employers get quality candidates as soon as they
[00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:17.380]   sponsor their job post.
[00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:18.940]   That's pretty fast.
[00:41:18.940 --> 00:41:23.060]   Indeed, skills tests on average reduces hiring time by 27%
[00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:25.980]   by weeding out the candidates who just don't have the skills
[00:41:25.980 --> 00:41:27.500]   you must have.
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:29.660]   And by the way, you don't have to create those.
[00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:32.980]   You can choose from more than 130 skill tests.
[00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:35.820]   And then if you have a few must-have requirements, you can
[00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:36.900]   add those.
[00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:41.100]   You only pay for applications that pass the skills test.
[00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:45.740]   No more money spent or time wasted on candidates that don't
[00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:47.660]   fill your needs.
[00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:50.700]   According to Talent Nest, Indeed delivers four times more
[00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:56.900]   hires than all other job sites combined according to ComScore
[00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:59.660]   and Deed's the number one job site in the world with more
[00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:01.620]   total visits than any other job site.
[00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:05.060]   That means more chance that the person you're looking for is
[00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:05.740]   already there.
[00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:09.220]   If you're hiring, you need, indeed, join over 3 million
[00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:12.420]   businesses worldwide that use Indeed to hire great talent.

[00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:38.860]   Thank you so much for your support of this week in tech.
[00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:40.060]   Indeed.
[00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:42.860]   And thank you for supporting Twit by using that address so
[00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:44.460]   they know you saw it here.
[00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:47.540]   Indeed.com/twit.
[00:42:47.540 --> 00:42:50.660]   So the chatroom's telling me, I hope this won't break your
[00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:51.860]   heart, Sam.
[00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:56.700]   Mark has Brownlee got to drive the Ford Lightning F-150.
[00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:59.140]   See these YouTube stars?
[00:42:59.140 --> 00:42:59.860]   Well, we saw it.
[00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:00.380]   I watched the video.
[00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:00.860]   I watched the video.
[00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:01.780]   I'll drive it.
[00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:02.780]   Yeah.
[00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:03.540]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:04.260]   Biden did drive it.
[00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:04.700]   He gets to drive it.
[00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:04.980]   I don't think--
[00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:05.940]   He's the president.
[00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:08.140]   I don't think Mark has actually drove it.
[00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:08.980]   He sat in the drive.
[00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:09.940]   He watched the video.
[00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:10.780]   Yeah.
[00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:12.820]   You don't see him ever actually driving the thing.
[00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:14.260]   Sneaky, tricky.
[00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:15.140]   OK.
[00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:16.980]   He fooled everybody.
[00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:19.060]   Those YouTube guys.
[00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:19.660]   I may be wrong.
[00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:20.500]   He may have driven it.
[00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:22.780]   But you don't actually see him driving it in the video.
[00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:24.180]   It's actually a pet peeve of mine.
[00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:27.740]   All the YouTube stars get all this special treatment.
[00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:28.780]   Apple sent--
[00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:32.940]   I just seen seven iMacs, one in every color.
[00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:36.380]   It's like, I can't even get an invitation to an Apple event.
[00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:37.740]   It drives me nuts.
[00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:39.260]   I should have been a YouTube star.
[00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:41.860]   Because you sometimes say less than positive things
[00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:42.580]   about the Mac.
[00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:43.620]   Shocking.
[00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:46.100]   You'd think they'd want objective journalism?
[00:43:46.100 --> 00:43:46.900]   No.
[00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:48.060]   Not Apple.
[00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:48.380]   Not Apple.
[00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:49.380]   It'd be too much.
[00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:52.100]   That's why I'm becoming a Twitch star.
[00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:52.820]   And--
[00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:54.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:57.060]   I mean, nothing bad ever goes wrong on Twitch.
[00:43:57.060 --> 00:43:57.940]   No, there's no.
[00:43:57.940 --> 00:43:58.540]   Yeah.
[00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:01.660]   Well, I thought I'm going to get in the hot tub in a bikini,
[00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:02.940]   and then it'll be huge.
[00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:04.940]   And it just really didn't drive much traffic,
[00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:07.260]   I thought that would do better.
[00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:08.380]   Did you turn the bubbles on?
[00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:09.180]   That might have been--
[00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:11.100]   Oh, maybe that's what I did wrong.
[00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:15.020]   Amazon devices, which says Dan Goudon,
[00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:17.460]   will soon automatically share your internet with neighbors.
[00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:22.100]   And I know this is controversial, and I am in the minority.
[00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:23.980]   But having looked at Amazon's white paper,
[00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:27.060]   in fact, having had our security guy, Steve Gibson,
[00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:29.780]   did a whole show on it last year, late last year.
[00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:32.980]   I was impressed with Amazon's effort
[00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:36.060]   to make it secure and effort to make it private.
[00:44:36.060 --> 00:44:39.220]   And as far as I could tell, it looks pretty darn good.
[00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:42.020]   There is a kind of community benefit to sidewalk,
[00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:43.340]   because it puts a--
[00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:44.820]   it's a low speed network.
[00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:46.260]   It's not sharing your internet,
[00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:48.140]   but it's not sharing a lot of your internet.
[00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:50.980]   It's like 80 kilobits at most.
[00:44:50.980 --> 00:44:56.780]   So that lost dogs can be seen anywhere in your general vicinity.
[00:44:56.780 --> 00:45:00.060]   I mean, it just seems like this is a good thing.
[00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:04.380]   Dan, I think, is kind of scaring people and says,
[00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:05.500]   well, there might be a problem.
[00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:08.340]   There have historically been problems with IoT devices,
[00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:10.180]   and Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.
[00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:12.940]   Does that mean we should never do any IoT Wi-Fi or Bluetooth
[00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:13.780]   devices?
[00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:15.020]   Because it could be a problem.
[00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:16.460]   I don't think that's fair.
[00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:18.220]   He also shows you how to turn it off,
[00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:22.020]   which admittedly Amazon kind of buries three levels.
[00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:22.460]   Yeah.
[00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:24.460]   I mean, I think the difference here
[00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:28.260]   is that it is by default enabled on.
[00:45:28.260 --> 00:45:29.100]   I think that's the--
[00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:30.660]   By default on, that's right.
[00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:31.100]   Yep.
[00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:32.060]   That's the issue here.
[00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:34.260]   Is it's one thing if you want to--
[00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:34.900]   But nobody would opt in.
[00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:36.260]   --off to a platform.
[00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:38.060]   OK, well, then maybe it shouldn't exist.
[00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:42.100]   If the only reason that your tech thing is going to work
[00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:44.180]   is because you're tricking people into using it,
[00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:46.740]   then maybe it's not something that's going on.
[00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:50.820]   Trick is such a pejorative word.
[00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:52.700]   It's not a trick.
[00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:53.700]   It's--
[00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:56.020]   You're just sneaking it in under there.
[00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:57.820]   Well, I mean, they published the white paper.
[00:45:57.820 --> 00:45:59.060]   They told people they're doing this.
[00:45:59.060 --> 00:45:59.580]   It turns on--
[00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:01.580]   Probably publish the white paper.
[00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:03.620]   It turns on June 8.
[00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:06.060]   Turns on June 8.
[00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:07.060]   There isn't much risk.
[00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:08.260]   It doesn't use a lot of bandwidth.
[00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:09.980]   And there is a great benefit.
[00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:12.420]   I think they understand that people
[00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:14.460]   are going to get scared by articles like this.
[00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:18.220]   And people saying, oh, you don't want Amazon to have a network.
[00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:20.100]   But I think there's a huge benefit.
[00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:21.300]   Tiles going to use this.
[00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:24.380]   It's the only way tile can compete against Apple's air
[00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:28.740]   tags because Apple's air tags use iPhones to do the network.
[00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:35.820]   Everybody with an iPhone is creating a network for air tags.
[00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:37.220]   How else does tiles compete?
[00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:39.340]   They are going to tie in a sidewalk,
[00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:42.140]   which will give them roughly a similar footprint.
[00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:45.700]   Maybe not as big, but a good footprint.
[00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:47.260]   That's a benefit to the public.
[00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:50.420]   And sometimes the public doesn't know what's good for them.
[00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:51.340]   Can't believe I said that.
[00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:52.540]   But Amazon does.
[00:46:52.540 --> 00:46:54.500]   Amazon might.
[00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:55.500]   What do you think?
[00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:58.260]   I think if it wasn't Amazon doing this,
[00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:03.140]   I think people would be a lot less concerned about it.
[00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:05.260]   Yes, I understand.
[00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:06.540]   I think Amazon knew that.
[00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:08.820]   And so they really worked hard to make it private.
[00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:12.180]   It doesn't in any way reveal who you are,
[00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:15.100]   where you're coming from.
[00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:18.180]   But how many times have companies told us that?
[00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:21.780]   And then some hack or issue happens.
[00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:25.220]   And it's revealed to-- even in the case,
[00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:26.700]   it's a little bit of a different example.
[00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:29.780]   But in the case of Alexa devices,
[00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:34.340]   there was that great Bloomberg feature that was in the cover
[00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:37.620]   a year or two ago about how your recordings from,
[00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:39.740]   whenever you were talking to your echo,
[00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:44.260]   were being listened to by a bunch of low wage paid workers.
[00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:45.260]   Right.
[00:47:45.260 --> 00:47:45.780]   Right.
[00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:50.380]   And they were sharing fun recordings from your house.
[00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:53.940]   I mean, I'm sure they were fun.
[00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:56.500]   But something else like that happening,
[00:47:56.500 --> 00:48:00.140]   as it gets closer and closer to, I guess,
[00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:03.540]   our internet, the core of our online and increasingly
[00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:07.460]   like offline lives, it gets a bit more concerning.
[00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:10.900]   I mean, as much as Dan's written this article
[00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:14.060]   and we talk about it and we've told people how to turn it off,
[00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:16.220]   I've told people on the radio show how to turn it off,
[00:48:16.220 --> 00:48:19.060]   while lobbying to have them turn it on,
[00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:22.060]   I think because it is a default and because most people
[00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:26.140]   won't even know about it, it's going to happen.
[00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:26.660]   And you're right--
[00:48:26.660 --> 00:48:27.980]   Are you living yours on?
[00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:29.420]   Yeah, I am leaving my eye on it.
[00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:31.060]   But I'm not-- I don't know.
[00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:32.780]   Maybe I'm the bad--
[00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:33.820]   I'm the guy who was always saying--
[00:48:33.820 --> 00:48:35.540]   You have a ring, you know?
[00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:36.820]   You have a ring.
[00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:40.140]   I got-- I replaced my ring with a doorbell from Google.
[00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:41.340]   So that's got to be bad.
[00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:42.700]   Oh, wow.
[00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:45.620]   I mean, that's-- you're going up the aggregates
[00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:47.580]   of a ring.
[00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:51.820]   Well, not to jump on this unpopular boat with you, Leo.
[00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:57.660]   But on some level, isn't the ultimate dream of the internet
[00:48:57.660 --> 00:48:59.940]   truly decentralized one where there aren't servers
[00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:01.660]   where all of these devices are like--
[00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:02.900]   Yeah, it's a bit mesh.
[00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:04.620]   Yeah, that's what this is.
[00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:05.820]   It's not a high speed network.
[00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:07.940]   It's not like you could surf the net on it.
[00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:11.060]   It's really more for things like tracking.
[00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:15.580]   If every single device, to some degree or another,
[00:49:15.580 --> 00:49:18.020]   some little sliver of its connection,
[00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:21.060]   was helping every other device in the world
[00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:21.660]   have a connection--
[00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:22.660]   Isn't that cool?
[00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:25.140]   You wouldn't have a situation where governments could be like,
[00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:28.420]   go find the server rooms and shut them off
[00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:31.980]   because you couldn't shut off every single device.
[00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:35.780]   Now, Amazon doing that is not exactly the decentralized
[00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:36.420]   dream.
[00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:38.300]   One huge company doing that maybe isn't.
[00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:39.220]   But--
[00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:42.500]   Well, who would do this to people that you would trust,
[00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:43.300]   Brian or Paris?
[00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:45.260]   Who would you-- who could do this that you would say,
[00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:47.180]   oh, I'm glad they're doing it.
[00:49:47.180 --> 00:49:47.740]   Nobody.
[00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:49.220]   I feel like that's the issue.
[00:49:49.220 --> 00:49:53.060]   It's one central figure company handling this.
[00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:53.660]   Would you trust it if--
[00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:55.020]   It's not going to be decentralized.
[00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:58.100]   We could trust if the American government did it.
[00:49:58.100 --> 00:50:02.340]   I mean, I don't think any central power being responsible--
[00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:04.260]   The United Nations should do it.
[00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:08.260]   There is a crypto company.
[00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:10.260]   Oh, I definitely don't trust them.
[00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:11.460]   Yeah, right.
[00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:13.060]   Helium, helium, helium.
[00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:13.620]   Helium.
[00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:15.300]   So that-- we've talked a lot about helium.
[00:50:15.300 --> 00:50:16.060]   That's very interesting.
[00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:18.180]   He's talking about that on Twig this week.
[00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:18.660]   Yeah.
[00:50:18.660 --> 00:50:19.460]   What is that?
[00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:19.940]   What is that?
[00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:23.700]   So this is a router that mines a cryptocurrency.
[00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:26.580]   Oh, god.
[00:50:26.580 --> 00:50:27.500]   No, wait a minute.
[00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:28.540]   But--
[00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:29.860]   But there's more.
[00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:31.020]   Wait, there's more.
[00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:32.460]   You get money.
[00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:34.100]   In fact, I didn't realize this.
[00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:36.620]   But Stacey's gotten something like $18,000
[00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:38.140]   since she put this thing in.
[00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:39.180]   You get money.
[00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:42.620]   It's in a cryptocurrency, but you can convert it to dollars.
[00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:45.660]   Not proof of work, which is how Bitcoin works,
[00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:48.740]   or proof of stake, which is how the future imaginary
[00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:50.020]   cryptocurrencies will work.
[00:50:50.020 --> 00:50:52.580]   But through proof of coverage, when somebody uses--
[00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:54.660]   and it's low raw, just like sidewalk,
[00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:59.060]   somebody uses your long-range, slow, wide-area network for--
[00:50:59.060 --> 00:51:00.300]   she lives on an island.
[00:51:00.300 --> 00:51:05.700]   So she thinks ships are using it for location and data,
[00:51:05.700 --> 00:51:07.180]   of some kind.
[00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:10.660]   You get a small amount of money, and she's gotten a lot of money.
[00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:13.180]   So Paris, I actually--
[00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:14.580]   I found out about this a year ago,
[00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:15.620]   and I really considered it because--
[00:51:15.620 --> 00:51:18.380]   I tried to buy it, but you can't, because it sold out.
[00:51:18.380 --> 00:51:21.780]   But you and I, living in Brooklyn,
[00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:25.100]   the idea was is you would put a little router in your window.
[00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:25.420]   Right.
[00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:26.420]   And so then all of those--
[00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:28.260]   This is kind of like NYC Mesh.
[00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:29.140]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:30.940]   And then it's been a little bit cracky before that.
[00:51:30.940 --> 00:51:35.620]   This has been proposed in past years as well.
[00:51:35.620 --> 00:51:39.740]   And like Leo's saying, apparently, the currency has exploded,
[00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:40.500]   or it did.
[00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:44.540]   Who knows what happened in the last 48 hours?
[00:51:44.540 --> 00:51:47.100]   Like all crypto go up and down.
[00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:47.860]   Right.
[00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:49.740]   But that was the point, is that you would just
[00:51:49.740 --> 00:51:51.180]   hang one of these in your window,
[00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:53.020]   and then in a place like here where
[00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:56.060]   it could be used by the Amazon delivery track,
[00:51:56.060 --> 00:51:59.100]   or the smart dog collar that goes by, or whatever.
[00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:01.940]   It seems like we would be a high traffic area for that
[00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:04.340]   to happen, so I really considered it,
[00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:06.900]   and now I regret not pulling the trigger on it.
[00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:07.260]   I--
[00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:10.060]   You guys mentioned at the beginning of this cryptocurrency.
[00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:12.980]   So is this-- how many trees is this killing per--
[00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:13.500]   No.
[00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:15.780]   Oh, that's what's so cool about it.
[00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:17.220]   It's not GPU mining.
[00:52:17.220 --> 00:52:18.620]   It's not hugely powerful.
[00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:22.300]   Doesn't use much power at all, because the way it
[00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:25.300]   mines it is by proof of coverage, not by proof of work.
[00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:26.020]   So you're not doing--
[00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:26.540]   That's right.
[00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:29.980]   Yes, it's a crypto-- it's an environmentally friendly
[00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:31.100]   cryptocurrency.
[00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:32.380]   Now how much would you pay?
[00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:33.380]   OK.
[00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:34.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:35.580]   I don't know.
[00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:37.740]   My fire is pretty deep.
[00:52:37.740 --> 00:52:38.580]   You have fire.
[00:52:38.580 --> 00:52:39.020]   Is this--
[00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:39.020]   Is helium--
[00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:39.020]   Right?
[00:52:39.020 --> 00:52:41.180]   Do you pay for your fire?
[00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:43.580]   Is helium capped at the number of tokens
[00:52:43.580 --> 00:52:47.580]   that can be generated like Bitcoin is, or is it open-ended?
[00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:48.100]   Like--
[00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:49.380]   Oh, that's a good question.
[00:52:49.380 --> 00:52:50.900]   I don't know enough of that.
[00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:51.380]   Yeah.
[00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:53.660]   I don't know.
[00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:58.220]   That's a white paper right there.
[00:52:58.220 --> 00:52:59.660]   Mark Benning, offs an investor.
[00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:02.220]   Does that help?
[00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:02.740]   Not really.
[00:53:02.740 --> 00:53:03.300]   No.
[00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:03.740]   Google--
[00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:04.260]   Again?
[00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:05.660]   I know.
[00:53:05.660 --> 00:53:09.500]   Google Ventures has invested.
[00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:12.700]   I just think it's very interesting.
[00:53:12.700 --> 00:53:17.420]   There's a lot of benefit to creating,
[00:53:17.420 --> 00:53:18.980]   and it doesn't have to be a high-speed network.
[00:53:18.980 --> 00:53:20.260]   We're not talking that you can--
[00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:22.420]   we're not doing what like Xfinity and Cox do,
[00:53:22.420 --> 00:53:24.580]   which is take over your--
[00:53:24.580 --> 00:53:28.780]   by the way, they're doing it to create a Wi-Fi network
[00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:29.860]   taking over your router.
[00:53:29.860 --> 00:53:31.900]   And most people, that's on by default.
[00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:34.060]   If you get an Xfinity router, a Comcast router,
[00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:35.580]   or I can't remember who else.
[00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:36.980]   I think Spectrum's doing it.
[00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:37.860]   Maybe Cox.
[00:53:37.860 --> 00:53:39.860]   If you get one of their routers, it automatically--
[00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:42.980]   it creates this guest network that people can use
[00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:44.020]   if they're subscribers.
[00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:46.780]   That's all to the benefit of those companies.
[00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:48.180]   This is not quite like that.
[00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:49.700]   This is really--
[00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:51.340]   I think Amazon's benefit probably
[00:53:51.340 --> 00:53:52.940]   is something like delivery trucks.
[00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:55.140]   Like they would love to know where the delivery trucks are.
[00:53:55.140 --> 00:53:57.820]   But they have GPS in those trucks, so they can't be it.
[00:53:57.820 --> 00:54:00.340]   Yeah, they have GPS out the ball zoo in those trucks.
[00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:01.860]   Yeah.
[00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:04.780]   So I wonder if the low signal thing is,
[00:54:04.780 --> 00:54:08.540]   as opposed to where the truck is, what's still on that truck?
[00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:10.980]   Like how close would they be able to--
[00:54:10.980 --> 00:54:14.060]   they could use that to ping you that your delivery
[00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:15.140]   is three minutes away.
[00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:17.060]   You could put a little device in every package.
[00:54:17.060 --> 00:54:18.860]   Well, they already do that though.
[00:54:18.860 --> 00:54:19.460]   That's true.
[00:54:19.460 --> 00:54:20.540]   That's true.
[00:54:20.540 --> 00:54:22.220]   Well, they do a device scanning.
[00:54:22.220 --> 00:54:23.740]   But what if you put a little--
[00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:25.100]   I guess it's too expensive, but you
[00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:26.860]   could put a little tag on every--
[00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:28.300]   little tile tag on every--
[00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:30.460]   Oh, well, what about the idea that--
[00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:33.940]   you see the delivery people have to scan the package every time.
[00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:36.740]   So what if a house had this device in it?
[00:54:36.740 --> 00:54:38.220]   And so then, again, the package would
[00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:41.460]   know to the second when it hit that doorstep or something
[00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:42.500]   like that.
[00:54:42.500 --> 00:54:43.380]   Well, I get a picture.
[00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:46.460]   Yeah, then you've got to put something in RFID tag.
[00:54:46.460 --> 00:54:47.300]   That's too expensive.
[00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:47.780]   Something--
[00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:48.580]   It wouldn't be RFID.
[00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:50.100]   That's the problem.
[00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:51.100]   It would have to be--
[00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:54.540]   Yeah, or some sort of token.
[00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:57.020]   Yeah, because you have this network everywhere.
[00:54:57.020 --> 00:54:59.300]   Might be something you could make cheaply or down the road
[00:54:59.300 --> 00:55:00.660]   making--
[00:55:00.660 --> 00:55:04.180]   As it is now, when I'm getting an Amazon package,
[00:55:04.180 --> 00:55:05.540]   I get a notification--
[00:55:05.540 --> 00:55:08.020]   if it's coming via an Amazon Prime truck,
[00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:09.660]   I get a notification--
[00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:11.340]   the truck is two stops away.
[00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:12.660]   I get that from UPS too now.
[00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:13.980]   They're in competition.
[00:55:13.980 --> 00:55:14.700]   They're all--
[00:55:14.700 --> 00:55:17.020]   UPS, they've really stepped up their game.
[00:55:17.020 --> 00:55:18.900]   You can follow the truck along in a little bit.
[00:55:18.900 --> 00:55:19.900]   I get a little map.
[00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:20.940]   Yeah.
[00:55:20.940 --> 00:55:22.500]   Sam, what about this?
[00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:25.980]   What if this was in all of our windows here in Brooklyn?
[00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:28.820]   And with that signal, it's probably too weak.
[00:55:28.820 --> 00:55:32.780]   But what if that helped self-driving vehicles in cities?
[00:55:32.780 --> 00:55:36.860]   What if there was little signals to ping the cars as they go by?
[00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:39.820]   There's actually already a technology for that--
[00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:43.580]   what they call V to X vehicle to everything communications.
[00:55:43.580 --> 00:55:47.020]   And they've been working on this for quite some time,
[00:55:47.020 --> 00:55:49.420]   where you've got vehicle to vehicle, vehicle to infrastructure,
[00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:50.940]   vehicle to pedestrian.
[00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:52.100]   Originally, they were going to do it
[00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:56.300]   with something called DSRC, which was a flavor of Wi-Fi.
[00:55:56.300 --> 00:55:58.780]   They've now switched over to cellular V to X,
[00:55:58.780 --> 00:56:03.540]   which is basically using LTE or 5G.
[00:56:03.540 --> 00:56:05.980]   It branches off from that, because it doesn't actually
[00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:08.020]   have to go through the cell network.
[00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:12.660]   It can broadcast directly to other nodes around you.
[00:56:12.660 --> 00:56:17.460]   And so it can-- for example, when you're driving down the road,
[00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:23.700]   if your wheel starts slipping, and if you hit a patch of ice,
[00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:27.860]   and your wheel slips and your stability control turns on,
[00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:31.060]   it will broadcast a message to other vehicles around you
[00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:33.980]   that, hey, there's a patch of ice here.
[00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:36.580]   And alert other drivers.
[00:56:36.580 --> 00:56:39.740]   And they're doing this now, Argo AI,
[00:56:39.740 --> 00:56:42.900]   which is a partner of Ford developing their automated driving
[00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:45.100]   system, is doing this in Miami now.
[00:56:45.100 --> 00:56:49.340]   They've put up-- because all the sensors on these automated
[00:56:49.340 --> 00:56:51.420]   vehicles are limited to line of sight.
[00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:55.500]   They can't see through buildings or through other vehicles.
[00:56:55.500 --> 00:56:59.780]   So at certain intersections where there's limited visibility,
[00:56:59.780 --> 00:57:02.460]   they've put up sensor pods over the middle of the intersection
[00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:06.980]   with CV to X radios that will look down the cross street.
[00:57:06.980 --> 00:57:11.820]   And if there's a vehicle coming that might be a hazard to the AV,
[00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:14.220]   it will broadcast that and say, hey,
[00:57:14.220 --> 00:57:17.180]   there's a car coming at high speed at this intersection.
[00:57:17.180 --> 00:57:20.300]   Be aware so that the automated vehicle could slow down
[00:57:20.300 --> 00:57:21.660]   before it gets there.
[00:57:21.660 --> 00:57:24.860]   And Motionals also doing this in Las Vegas now.
[00:57:24.860 --> 00:57:28.300]   And most of the Chinese AV companies
[00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:31.540]   are also doing this in China, where they're further along
[00:57:31.540 --> 00:57:33.900]   with CV to X than we are here.
[00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:35.180]   How much bandwidth do you need?
[00:57:35.180 --> 00:57:39.820]   Could it something like sidewalk be enough?
[00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:41.180]   I don't know if sidewalk would be enough.
[00:57:41.180 --> 00:57:43.420]   I mean, it doesn't take a whole lot of bandwidth
[00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:44.620]   because it's standards.
[00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:45.820]   Yeah.
[00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:49.180]   The messaging standard, there's what
[00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:51.460]   they call the basic safety messages standard.
[00:57:51.460 --> 00:57:52.900]   They're very small messages.
[00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:55.420]   They take very little bandwidth.
[00:57:55.420 --> 00:57:59.220]   So you can broadcast a lot of messages in an area.
[00:57:59.220 --> 00:58:02.660]   And it doesn't take much at all.
[00:58:02.660 --> 00:58:05.900]   If you go further forward and you want to start maybe sharing
[00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:08.620]   sensor data between vehicles, then you're going to need more.
[00:58:08.620 --> 00:58:11.380]   But for a lot of the initial stuff,
[00:58:11.380 --> 00:58:15.660]   you don't need very much bandwidth at all.
[00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:19.660]   If Amazon weren't doing it, Paris,
[00:58:19.660 --> 00:58:20.980]   you had an article in the information
[00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:25.100]   saying that the DC Attorney General is just the first,
[00:58:25.100 --> 00:58:26.940]   just the beginning.
[00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:27.420]   Yeah.
[00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:29.100]   I mean, not even the first.
[00:58:29.100 --> 00:58:30.820]   I was kind of picking up some news that
[00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:32.580]   had been published by Bloomberg recently
[00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:35.500]   that was really interesting about the fact
[00:58:35.500 --> 00:58:41.260]   that Attorney Generals in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania
[00:58:41.260 --> 00:58:44.700]   have recently begun looking into possible enforcement
[00:58:44.700 --> 00:58:46.700]   actions against Amazon.
[00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:50.300]   Same issues, antitrust stuff.
[00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:50.820]   Yeah.
[00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:55.420]   I mean, all antitrust stuff, I'm not sure--
[00:58:55.420 --> 00:58:58.460]   it's antitrust and related to the Amazon online marketplace,
[00:58:58.460 --> 00:58:58.940]   at least.
[00:58:58.940 --> 00:59:03.700]   And those attorney generals are joining other attorneys
[00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:08.540]   general in California, New York, Washington state, and the FTC.
[00:59:08.540 --> 00:59:12.180]   So there's a lot of activity going on in a lot of different fronts.
[00:59:12.180 --> 00:59:17.940]   And these are just the beginning of state and federal inquiries.
[00:59:17.940 --> 00:59:20.300]   Washington, DC kind of jumped the gun and actually found a lot.
[00:59:20.300 --> 00:59:22.300]   Oh, interesting.
[00:59:22.300 --> 00:59:24.740]   He probably wanted to get the headlines.
[00:59:24.740 --> 00:59:26.820]   He did.
[00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:28.820]   I'm not going to be one part of a big group.
[00:59:28.820 --> 00:59:32.300]   I am going to do it all on my own.
[00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:32.980]   Interesting.
[00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:35.900]   So the states, there are federal--
[00:59:35.900 --> 00:59:39.540]   there's congressional investigations going on Amazon.
[00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:42.740]   Yeah, and there's also been recently in the--
[00:59:42.740 --> 00:59:44.500]   god, it was last year, I guess.
[00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:46.900]   Everything in this past year feels like a haze.
[00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:49.020]   The House Judiciary Committee--
[00:59:49.020 --> 00:59:49.820]   Right.
[00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:52.420]   --published a really lengthy antitrust report
[00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:54.540]   and a large part of it was dedicated to Amazon.
[00:59:54.540 --> 00:59:57.180]   And that's just kind of the first step.
[00:59:57.180 --> 01:00:00.740]   I really worry that--
[01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:03.940]   look, I understand we need to do this.
[01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:06.180]   And there are things that these companies are doing that
[01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:07.020]   are predatory.
[01:00:07.020 --> 01:00:08.820]   There's no question about that.
[01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:12.040]   At the same time, I also think that some of that tarnishes
[01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:13.660]   some of the good things these companies are doing,
[01:00:13.660 --> 01:00:17.100]   like maybe even sidewalk, where I think there's
[01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:19.900]   things we're not going to get because of just this--
[01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:21.740]   I hate to use the phrase moral panic.
[01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:23.420]   That's what Jeff Jarvis uses.
[01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:25.340]   But this kind of fear of technology,
[01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:26.620]   there's two things going on.
[01:00:26.620 --> 01:00:29.700]   They're making too much money and they have too much power.
[01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:31.140]   And we're going to cut them down to size.
[01:00:31.140 --> 01:00:34.700]   And I feel like that could be risky too.
[01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:37.700]   Boy, what would this pandemic have been like if we didn't
[01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:41.060]   have these technology companies?
[01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:41.860]   The internet would go--
[01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:44.780]   I mean, I think it would be wrong to say
[01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:49.340]   that any of its action will completely erase any of these
[01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:52.420]   companies from the map or diminish them greatly.
[01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:55.820]   I mean, Microsoft's still around and it went through this
[01:00:55.820 --> 01:00:56.780]   exact same thing.
[01:00:56.780 --> 01:00:59.260]   It's not something that is going to kill off these companies.
[01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:02.380]   It-- regulation does not mean death.
[01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:04.740]   You could make the argument that actually made Microsoft
[01:01:04.740 --> 01:01:07.380]   a better company, actually.
[01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:11.020]   And the same argument can be made breaking up
[01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:14.820]   mobbell, even though they all reconstructed themselves
[01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:16.140]   into Verizon and AT&T.
[01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:17.500]   And so it's kind of a moot point.
[01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:21.100]   But there was a 20 to 25 year period where all of these
[01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:24.540]   companies allowed this explosion of innovation that
[01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:28.700]   allowed the whole mobile everything industry to form.
[01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:32.900]   So even-- and also there's that famous example that the day
[01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:35.340]   that AT&T got broken up, if you were a shareholder, if you
[01:01:35.340 --> 01:01:38.540]   just held on to all of those companies that got spun off
[01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:40.980]   because you would get the shares in the new companies,
[01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:42.260]   you made a killing.
[01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:45.100]   So it's not bad for investors sometimes.
[01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:48.180]   Antitrust stuff, it's not bad for companies sometimes.
[01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:49.020]   It's not bad for consumers.
[01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:51.020]   It's usually good for consumers.
[01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:51.740]   Yeah.
[01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:56.340]   And even though the baby bells have largely reconstituted
[01:01:56.340 --> 01:02:00.020]   themselves as AT&T and Verizon, if you look at the overall
[01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:03.460]   communication landscape we have today, it's way different
[01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:09.060]   than it was in what 1984 when they split up AT&T.
[01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:13.700]   We have so many more methods of communication now than we did
[01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:13.940]   then.
[01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:16.700]   Yes, we're limited in the number of wireless carriers
[01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:17.780]   that we have access to.
[01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:21.620]   But we've got options from just talking on the phone
[01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:25.660]   to all kinds of different messaging services, including
[01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:28.620]   encrypt, you've got everything like signal and telegram
[01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:32.100]   and iMessage and Skype and everything
[01:02:32.100 --> 01:02:33.340]   and Zoom and everything else we use.
[01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:37.860]   So a lot of that probably wouldn't have happened if we hadn't
[01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:41.420]   had that split up of AT&T in the first place.
[01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:48.860]   AT&T sat on the technology of having not voicemail.
[01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:51.220]   What am I thinking of?
[01:02:51.220 --> 01:02:52.300]   Answering machines.
[01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:54.140]   Answering machines.
[01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:56.540]   Well, you know, remember the card or phone decision that said
[01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:59.260]   you didn't have to rent your equipment from AT&T?
[01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:03.100]   You could actually buy a phone that was also transformative.
[01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:05.660]   So yeah, maybe every 20 to 40 years
[01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:08.860]   we have to go through a little purge.
[01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:12.340]   It's like they say in the godfather about the mob wars.
[01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:13.060]   It's good.
[01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:14.820]   Every few years you have to have one of these.
[01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:15.460]   Yeah.
[01:03:15.460 --> 01:03:17.220]   Go to the mattresses AT&T.
[01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:18.780]   Go to the mattresses.
[01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:21.340]   I heard an interesting concept a few years back.
[01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:22.940]   I can't remember where it came from.
[01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:26.260]   The idea is that maybe what we need to do
[01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:30.260]   is have a time limit on corporations,
[01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:32.620]   a 20 or 30 year time limit.
[01:03:32.620 --> 01:03:36.860]   And once you hit that, the company's dissolved.
[01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:37.300]   I agree.
[01:03:37.300 --> 01:03:37.940]   And you start over again.
[01:03:37.940 --> 01:03:38.260]   Sure.
[01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:39.380]   Start over.
[01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:42.580]   Then nobody will build a company ever.
[01:03:42.580 --> 01:03:47.980]   I also think billionaires should be capped at $999,999,000.
[01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:49.220]   Just that's it.
[01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:49.940]   That's all you get.
[01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:51.380]   But then how would they be able to afford
[01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:53.540]   a smaller yacht for their big yacht?
[01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:54.180]   Good point.
[01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:54.740]   Good point.
[01:03:54.740 --> 01:03:56.100]   Think about the smaller yachts.
[01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:57.860]   Think about the smaller yachts.
[01:03:57.860 --> 01:04:00.300]   You were talking, Paris, about--
[01:04:00.300 --> 01:04:02.140]   you think the smoking gun with Sidewalk
[01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:06.140]   is the fact that Amazon turned it on by default and hit it.
[01:04:06.140 --> 01:04:08.700]   Now there's a smoking gun for Google.
[01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:09.780]   This is part of a lawsuit.
[01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:10.780]   There's a lot of smoking guns.
[01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:11.700]   There's quite a few.
[01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:12.500]   This is a new one.
[01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:16.140]   There's a lawsuit, I guess Arizona is going after Google.
[01:04:16.140 --> 01:04:18.260]   And of course, one of the great things about lawsuits
[01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:21.460]   is you get discovery and documents.
[01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:21.980]   The judge--
[01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:23.380]   You'll love to see those documents.
[01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:25.300]   Yeah, they really tell you--
[01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:28.460]   if I were a company, I'd say stay out of the courts.
[01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:31.700]   Lawyers complaints in these sort of check battles
[01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:33.180]   are my favorite thing to read.
[01:04:33.180 --> 01:04:38.940]   Just going back and forth, it is the most dramatic, but politely
[01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:40.340]   worded thing possible.
[01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:41.660]   So juicy.
[01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:45.020]   Arizona went after Google because if you turn off location
[01:04:45.020 --> 01:04:47.940]   settings, you might assume Google no longer knows where you are.
[01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:48.860]   But of course, they do.
[01:04:48.860 --> 01:04:52.780]   So that was, I think, a fairly reasonable lawsuit.
[01:04:52.780 --> 01:04:55.700]   The documents were hidden, but a judge
[01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:59.420]   has ordered them to be unredacted in response
[01:04:59.420 --> 01:05:02.260]   to a request by trade groups, digital content next,
[01:05:02.260 --> 01:05:04.220]   and news media alliance, which argued it
[01:05:04.220 --> 01:05:07.300]   was in the public interest to know that Google was using
[01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:10.740]   its legal resources to suppress scrutiny of its data collection
[01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:11.780]   practices.
[01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:15.740]   The unsealed documents are definitely a smoking gun,
[01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:19.740]   including email from users.
[01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:20.860]   Here's one of the documents.
[01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:24.100]   So there's no way to give a third party app your location
[01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:25.020]   and not Google.
[01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:27.300]   One employee said, adding, this doesn't sound like something
[01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:29.260]   we'd want on the front page of the New York Times.
[01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:33.940]   When Google-- this is the smoking gun.
[01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:36.740]   When Google tested versions of its Android operating system
[01:05:36.740 --> 01:05:41.180]   that made privacy settings easier to find, guess what?
[01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:42.740]   Users took advantage of them.
[01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:46.220]   Google viewed that as a problem according to the documents.
[01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:47.900]   To solve that problem, Google then
[01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:50.380]   sought to bury those settings deeper
[01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:54.220]   within the settings menu, just like Amazon did with the sign.
[01:05:54.220 --> 01:05:58.940]   Crucially put pressures on partners like LG and other OEMs
[01:05:58.940 --> 01:06:00.780]   to do the same.
[01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:02.660]   Google also tried to convince smartphone makers
[01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:04.700]   to hide location settings, quote,
[01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:08.620]   "through active misrepresentations and/or concealment
[01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:09.300]   suppression."
[01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:12.020]   This is Google telling LG, you should
[01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:16.020]   use active misrepresentations, and/or concealment suppression,
[01:06:16.020 --> 01:06:19.620]   or emissions of facts.
[01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:20.700]   Dark patterns.
[01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:22.900]   Dark patterns.
[01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:26.340]   Smoking a gun much.
[01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:28.580]   And I mean, the thing that's so wild about these sort
[01:06:28.580 --> 01:06:32.420]   of techniques is it's not one-off cases like Google.
[01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:35.620]   This is-- these are the sort of decisions and practices
[01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:38.740]   that are almost standard in the tech industry
[01:06:38.740 --> 01:06:39.780]   for a lot of companies.
[01:06:39.780 --> 01:06:43.740]   I remember in like 2019 or something,
[01:06:43.740 --> 01:06:45.860]   I ended up writing an article for Wired,
[01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:48.180]   which I was working at the time, about a Facebook feature.
[01:06:48.180 --> 01:06:51.340]   I realized when on vacation one day,
[01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:53.380]   and I redownloaded Instagram, I realized
[01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:55.820]   I kept getting notifications for my Facebook account
[01:06:55.820 --> 01:06:57.820]   on the Instagram app, which is wild,
[01:06:57.820 --> 01:06:59.180]   and I looked in these settings.
[01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:01.740]   And there was a button that said on link Facebook,
[01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:03.180]   and I had it turned off.
[01:07:03.180 --> 01:07:06.060]   And so I messaged PR Facebook, and I was like, oh, you know,
[01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:06.780]   it's odd.
[01:07:06.780 --> 01:07:09.340]   Does the on-link Facebook button in Instagram,
[01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:11.220]   or is that not on link Facebook?
[01:07:11.220 --> 01:07:12.460]   And they're like, no.
[01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:12.940]   Not that part.
[01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:14.860]   It doesn't on link Facebook.
[01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:16.700]   You can never on link Facebook, even if you
[01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:19.300]   turn the on link Facebook button on Raw.
[01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:22.980]   As you may know, Ms. Martin, oh, we own Instagram,
[01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:25.700]   and then we've decided that it would be in your interest
[01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:29.540]   to know exactly what you're up to on this vacation,
[01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:30.540]   as you call it.
[01:07:30.540 --> 01:07:32.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:07:32.500 --> 01:07:33.500]   Google.
[01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:34.500]   Google.
[01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:37.020]   At least they apparently have backed off a bit
[01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:40.500]   on the WhatsApp changes that would have--
[01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:41.140]   Oh, yeah.
[01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:45.780]   --required people to accept the Facebook terms of service,
[01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:48.140]   or have their WhatsApp capabilities limited.
[01:07:48.140 --> 01:07:48.500]   Right.
[01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:52.300]   They now say that if you do that, if you say,
[01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:54.860]   I don't want to share data, I don't want location data.
[01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:58.020]   You still be able to use all of WhatsApp's features.
[01:07:58.020 --> 01:08:00.340]   I think they did that because of public pressure.
[01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:02.700]   I'm obviously-- they did.
[01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:05.420]   So-- and by the way--
[01:08:05.420 --> 01:08:10.020]   I'm still deeply angered by the emerging of Instagram
[01:08:10.020 --> 01:08:12.540]   Messenger and Facebook Messenger and whatnot.
[01:08:12.540 --> 01:08:13.460]   I agree.
[01:08:13.460 --> 01:08:13.940]   I agree.
[01:08:13.940 --> 01:08:15.900]   It's really too bad.
[01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:19.420]   I express my anger by any Facebook messages
[01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:20.460]   that come through Instagram.
[01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:22.980]   I simply ignore them.
[01:08:22.980 --> 01:08:25.060]   I express my anger by having your news.
[01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:27.460]   Or neither anywhere near any of my phones.
[01:08:27.460 --> 01:08:29.140]   That seems to be the best way.
[01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:30.580]   I don't even have a Facebook account.
[01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:33.500]   That, by the way, works to decouple Facebook and Instagram.
[01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:34.700]   Not have a Facebook account.
[01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:36.300]   I still have an Instagram account.
[01:08:36.300 --> 01:08:38.620]   They've got a Facebook account.
[01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:39.660]   Yeah, then I guess I do.
[01:08:39.660 --> 01:08:40.620]   You just not see it.
[01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:41.660]   I just say hidden.
[01:08:41.660 --> 01:08:42.580]   It's called your Instagram.
[01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:45.300]   A secret Facebook account called Instagram.
[01:08:45.300 --> 01:08:45.820]   Yeah.
[01:08:45.820 --> 01:08:51.020]   Let's take a little break.
[01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:56.060]   Twitter apparently is going ahead to offer a very special version
[01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:59.380]   of Twitter-- Twitter blue for $2.99.
[01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:01.100]   If anybody's going to pay him $2.99,
[01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:02.060]   is this crowd right here?
[01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:03.260]   We'll find out.
[01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:06.740]   Florida has passed a new anti-Facebook law that's
[01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:08.180]   pro Disney.
[01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:11.580]   Well, any amusement park in Florida, I guess.
[01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:12.620]   We'll talk about that.
[01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:13.180]   Lots more.
[01:09:13.180 --> 01:09:14.420]   We've got a great panel.
[01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:15.660]   Samable Samet is here.
[01:09:15.660 --> 01:09:17.620]   Paris Martin, no.
[01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:18.980]   Brian McCullough.
[01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:20.620]   Great to have all three of you.
[01:09:20.620 --> 01:09:21.820]   We had a fun week this week.
[01:09:21.820 --> 01:09:22.860]   Do we have a promo?
[01:09:22.860 --> 01:09:24.260]   Well, you made a little movie for you.
[01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:25.900]   I guess you could watch this.
[01:09:25.900 --> 01:09:26.420]   Enjoy.
[01:09:26.420 --> 01:09:28.900]   All the guys have their brand new iPad Pro.
[01:09:28.900 --> 01:09:30.740]   Oh, you got the white magic keyboard.
[01:09:30.740 --> 01:09:32.420]   I can never eat Cheetos again.
[01:09:32.420 --> 01:09:33.380]   That's why you think ahead of you.
[01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:34.860]   Buy the orange and you're going to begin with.
[01:09:34.860 --> 01:09:35.300]   Already already.
[01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:36.100]   All the Cheetos.
[01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:36.580]   All the Cheetos.
[01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:37.580]   And Doritos that you want.
[01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:39.580]   It's the Cheetos Save Edition.
[01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:42.380]   Previously on Twitter.
[01:09:42.380 --> 01:09:43.780]   All about Android.
[01:09:43.780 --> 01:09:47.220]   The Pixel 6 and the Pixel 6 Pro.
[01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:50.540]   So these are two devices that these designs have been leaked
[01:09:50.540 --> 01:09:51.700]   by multiple sources.
[01:09:51.700 --> 01:09:53.580]   It started about a week and a half ago.
[01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:55.460]   Do you remember that movie, the Black Hole?
[01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:57.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:09:57.540 --> 01:09:59.780]   There really looks like that phone, doesn't it?
[01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:00.780]   That is an interesting--
[01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:03.220]   Well, Flow is not abused by any of this.
[01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:04.460]   Hands-on tech.
[01:10:04.460 --> 01:10:05.860]   Renee Richie, Andy, and Akko.
[01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:06.500]   Alex Lindsey.
[01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:09.300]   All three of the guys have their brand new iPad Pro.
[01:10:09.300 --> 01:10:11.460]   We'll talk about the screen and the camera.
[01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:12.980]   How good are they?
[01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:14.500]   Hands-on photography.
[01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:15.780]   Hey, what's going on, everybody?
[01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:18.260]   I am at Pruitt and this is Hands-on photography.
[01:10:18.260 --> 01:10:21.660]   I get to sit with an amazing photographer.
[01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:23.500]   Some of the things that I've seen from this man
[01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:26.780]   just really blows my mind from the simplicity of it
[01:10:26.780 --> 01:10:30.860]   and at times to the intricacies of it to the post-processing.
[01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:34.460]   And I'm talking about Mr. Larry Chin.
[01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:35.700]   Security now.
[01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:38.500]   Leo, you're going to want to go and test your skill.
[01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:41.260]   It took me an embarrassing number of times.
[01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:41.940]   I hate these.
[01:10:41.940 --> 01:10:43.500]   These captures, I just hate them.
[01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:46.020]   Well, this is the game of Doom.
[01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:46.540]   Oh.
[01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:47.100]   Oh.
[01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:48.100]   Yes.
[01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:49.100]   You know what I say now?
[01:10:49.100 --> 01:10:50.260]   I like that.
[01:10:50.260 --> 01:10:51.060]   Twit.
[01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:53.220]   I got your Bitcoin right here.
[01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:55.020]   Yeah, I wish you did.
[01:10:55.020 --> 01:10:57.900]   Great Jim Cutler, our VO guy.
[01:10:57.900 --> 01:11:00.140]   So now I know who has my Bitcoin.
[01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:02.140]   That's a good thing.
[01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:09.580]   Our show today brought to you by Melissa, my favorite--
[01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:11.300]   go ahead, fill in the blank.
[01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:14.460]   You know it's my favorite address, experts.
[01:11:14.460 --> 01:11:16.460]   If you've ever forgotten to take the check
[01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:20.380]   the date on a cart and a milk in your fridge, like milk,
[01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:23.660]   your customer data is also going bad every day.
[01:11:23.660 --> 01:11:27.740]   In fact, up to 30% of customer data goes bad every year.
[01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:28.620]   Now that's a problem.
[01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:31.020]   If you're sending catalogs to the wrong address bills
[01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:32.940]   to the wrong address brochures to the wrong address,
[01:11:32.940 --> 01:11:36.060]   emailing the wrong people, calling the wrong people,
[01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:38.900]   Melissa, make sure your data is accurate and current.
[01:11:38.900 --> 01:11:40.380]   So you reach the right customers.
[01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:42.700]   You waste less time contacting the wrong people.
[01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:44.620]   You offend fewer people.
[01:11:44.620 --> 01:11:46.100]   Their tools have helped businesses
[01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:50.300]   maintain fresh data for a long time, 35 years.
[01:11:50.300 --> 01:11:53.260]   Now over 10,000 businesses use the address experts
[01:11:53.260 --> 01:11:54.700]   to keep their data clean.
[01:11:54.700 --> 01:11:56.940]   You could not only verify addresses,
[01:11:56.940 --> 01:12:00.660]   but you can also verify emails, phone numbers, even names
[01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:03.020]   in real time with Melissa.
[01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:05.780]   Melissa's global address verification service
[01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:09.540]   has addresses for over 240 countries and territories.
[01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:12.580]   And you can-- I mean, there's a variety of ways to use it.
[01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:13.300]   There's on-prem.
[01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:14.540]   There's an API.
[01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:15.340]   There's a SAS.
[01:12:15.340 --> 01:12:17.700]   There's even FTP upload and download.
[01:12:17.700 --> 01:12:21.340]   But if you're using the real-time Melissa,
[01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:24.140]   you can actually verify these addresses at the point of entry.
[01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:25.860]   So you don't even start with a bad address.
[01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:27.780]   And how many times you know this happens?
[01:12:27.780 --> 01:12:29.900]   You fumble finger your street address.
[01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:31.780]   You get the wrong number in there.
[01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:34.220]   A customer service rep gets your name spelled wrong.
[01:12:34.220 --> 01:12:35.580]   You don't want that.
[01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:38.220]   You can validate existing customer data.
[01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:39.540]   You could find new customers.
[01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:42.300]   You can correct addresses as they're entered.
[01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:45.260]   And by the way, if you worried about duplication
[01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:47.580]   with Melissa's data matching, you can eliminate clutter
[01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:51.100]   and duplicates to increase the accuracy of your database,
[01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:53.380]   reduce postage and mailing costs.
[01:12:53.380 --> 01:12:56.580]   Get the information that completes your customer profiles,
[01:12:56.580 --> 01:12:57.300]   too.
[01:12:57.300 --> 01:13:01.420]   Public demographic information like property data, marital status,
[01:13:01.420 --> 01:13:02.860]   social media handles.
[01:13:02.860 --> 01:13:04.500]   Really get to know your customers.
[01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:06.620]   Melissa's flexible deployment options
[01:13:06.620 --> 01:13:09.300]   offer different platforms to suit any preference, business
[01:13:09.300 --> 01:13:10.700]   size, and budget.
[01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:12.740]   As I mentioned on-prem, there's a web service.
[01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:13.900]   There's SAS.
[01:13:13.900 --> 01:13:16.260]   There's secure FTP processing.
[01:13:16.260 --> 01:13:18.180]   And I want to emphasize, because I
[01:13:18.180 --> 01:13:20.380]   know you care a lot about the privacy
[01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:22.180]   of your data, so does Melissa.
[01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:24.820]   That's why they continually undergo independent security
[01:13:24.820 --> 01:13:28.020]   audits, because they're committed to the security
[01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:29.740]   privacy of your data.
[01:13:29.740 --> 01:13:33.900]   And to compliance, you have to be compliant with SOC 2
[01:13:33.900 --> 01:13:35.180]   or HIPAA or GDPR.
[01:13:35.180 --> 01:13:37.300]   They are, so you don't have to worry.
[01:13:37.300 --> 01:13:38.500]   By the way, congratulations.
[01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:41.540]   Melissa was just named a leader in address verification
[01:13:41.540 --> 01:13:45.340]   by G2 Crowd in that spring 2021 report.
[01:13:45.340 --> 01:13:46.700]   Good job, Melissa.
[01:13:46.700 --> 01:13:49.180]   Melissa's also been a great partner
[01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:51.700]   for communities and qualifying essential workers
[01:13:51.700 --> 01:13:54.700]   during the pandemic.
[01:13:54.700 --> 01:13:55.580]   It's still going on.
[01:13:55.580 --> 01:13:59.020]   If your organization qualifies, you get six months of free service,
[01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:01.260]   just apply it at the website, Melissa.com.
[01:14:01.260 --> 01:14:05.100]   So bottom line, don't put up with sour customer data.
[01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:07.900]   Try Melissa's APIs and their developer portal right now.
[01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:11.140]   It's easy to log on, sign up, and start playing in the API
[01:14:11.140 --> 01:14:12.780]   sandbox 24/7.
[01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:15.260]   In fact, just to get you started, 1,000 records
[01:14:15.260 --> 01:14:19.700]   cleaned for free at Melissa.com/twit.
[01:14:19.700 --> 01:14:24.180]   M-E-L-I-S-S-A, Melissa.com/twit.
[01:14:24.180 --> 01:14:27.740]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.
[01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:30.300]   Thank you for supporting us by using that address as well,
[01:14:30.300 --> 01:14:35.100]   Melissa.com/twit.
[01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:37.260]   Ooh, this is-- we'll get to some of those other stories
[01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:38.940]   I mentioned, but I do want to get this one in.
[01:14:38.940 --> 01:14:42.220]   This is actually really good news.
[01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:46.380]   The court has ruled-- the European Court of Human Rights
[01:14:46.380 --> 01:14:51.020]   has ruled that the UK spy agency, GCHQ, methods
[01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:53.540]   for bulk interception of online communications
[01:14:53.540 --> 01:14:56.980]   violated the right to privacy and violated
[01:14:56.980 --> 01:15:03.180]   the data collection laws, a landmark victory
[01:15:03.180 --> 01:15:05.020]   recorded to one of the applicants.
[01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:07.180]   The judges found the bulk interception regime
[01:15:07.180 --> 01:15:09.540]   reached the right to freedom of expression
[01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:11.220]   and contained insufficient protections
[01:15:11.220 --> 01:15:13.660]   for confidential journalistic material.
[01:15:13.660 --> 01:15:17.140]   However, we're not going to do anything about it.
[01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:19.260]   The decision to operate a bulk interception regime
[01:15:19.260 --> 01:15:21.580]   did not of itself violate the European Convention
[01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:25.380]   on human rights.
[01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:27.660]   I don't know if you could find GCHQ.
[01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:31.300]   It's nice to know that somebody cares.
[01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:34.460]   It's widely rumored the NSA has been doing the same thing
[01:15:34.460 --> 01:15:35.580]   for years.
[01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:42.340]   So this might be-- and I hope it is--
[01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:47.900]   a beginning of a way to challenge the Snoopers charter.
[01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:50.540]   And Liberty says-- Liberty, one of the plaintiffs
[01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:52.740]   says that this would allow its challenge
[01:15:52.740 --> 01:15:55.820]   to the IPA to proceed in UK courts.
[01:15:55.820 --> 01:15:59.380]   So the UK has actually really been aggressive
[01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:02.700]   in this kind of widespread snooping.
[01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:07.900]   I suspect the US, but I'm glad that this court ruled that way.
[01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:08.900]   OK.
[01:16:08.900 --> 01:16:15.260]   Florida has passed, and the governor,
[01:16:15.260 --> 01:16:18.660]   Rich DeSantis has signed into law
[01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:23.540]   the Stop Social Media Sensorship Act, which is really
[01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:27.180]   pretty much targeted at Twitter and Facebook
[01:16:27.180 --> 01:16:30.100]   for blocking President Trump.
[01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:32.860]   It's probably an enforceable expert, say, it violates
[01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:36.500]   not only Section 230, but also the First Amendment.
[01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:37.860]   I might have heard of that.
[01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:41.460]   It also violates the constitutional restriction
[01:16:41.460 --> 01:16:46.060]   on states regulating interstate commerce.
[01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:48.020]   According to the bill, social media sites
[01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:51.700]   will be fined $1.25 million for every day after two weeks
[01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:55.060]   that a statewide political candidate is banned.
[01:16:55.060 --> 01:16:57.940]   I wonder who that might be.
[01:16:57.940 --> 01:17:00.020]   But here's some good news.
[01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:05.820]   Unless you're in amusement park in Florida.
[01:17:05.820 --> 01:17:07.740]   So there's that.
[01:17:07.740 --> 01:17:09.820]   I mean, there's always got to be the Disney profession.
[01:17:09.820 --> 01:17:10.620]   Yeah.
[01:17:10.620 --> 01:17:12.740]   Exempt from the Stop Media Sensorship Act,
[01:17:12.740 --> 01:17:15.980]   one of the state's largest employers, Walt Disney Corp.
[01:17:15.980 --> 01:17:18.420]   If you own a theme park or entertainment venue
[01:17:18.420 --> 01:17:21.460]   larger than 25 acres--
[01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:23.220]   OK, well, there's an obvious solution
[01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:25.020]   to this Twitter aspect of my theme park.
[01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:26.100]   Yeah, I think Facebook--
[01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:27.100]   Could be hell on Earth.
[01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:29.700]   Facebook Festival.
[01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:32.900]   We'll just buy 25 acres of slomp-swamp land.
[01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:34.340]   And if I--
[01:17:34.340 --> 01:17:35.660]   Change nothing about--
[01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:36.660]   Change nothing about it.
[01:17:36.660 --> 01:17:37.660]   It's an theme park.
[01:17:37.660 --> 01:17:38.660]   People love it.
[01:17:38.660 --> 01:17:41.220]   Just have to be exact experience of being a mom.
[01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:42.220]   Yeah.
[01:17:42.220 --> 01:17:42.740]   Yeah.
[01:17:42.740 --> 01:17:45.540]   Maybe some Instagram influencer photo stops.
[01:17:45.540 --> 01:17:47.260]   And you're set.
[01:17:47.260 --> 01:17:48.820]   So obviously, this was Disney.
[01:17:48.820 --> 01:17:51.100]   By the way, Comcast has also protected
[01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:54.300]   their own Universal Studios Resort, of course.
[01:17:54.300 --> 01:17:57.820]   So if they want to start a social network,
[01:17:57.820 --> 01:18:01.060]   go ahead ban any politicians you want.
[01:18:01.060 --> 01:18:03.500]   I almost didn't cover that this week for the reason
[01:18:03.500 --> 01:18:04.300]   that you said that.
[01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:06.100]   Like, there's no way this will--
[01:18:06.100 --> 01:18:09.460]   On Impact, this will not fly through the courts.
[01:18:09.460 --> 01:18:14.140]   But then at the same time, using that as a sort of loophole
[01:18:14.140 --> 01:18:17.140]   to protect Disney and--
[01:18:17.140 --> 01:18:17.980]   And Comcast and stuff.
[01:18:17.980 --> 01:18:19.860]   It's so blatant.
[01:18:19.860 --> 01:18:22.180]   But that's so-- also dumb, because it's like,
[01:18:22.180 --> 01:18:24.500]   you don't think these other people have enough money
[01:18:24.500 --> 01:18:26.700]   that if you really held their feet to the fire,
[01:18:26.700 --> 01:18:28.460]   they wouldn't be able to buy--
[01:18:28.460 --> 01:18:28.860]   what is it?
[01:18:28.860 --> 01:18:31.460]   Wiki, watchy, Sea World.
[01:18:31.460 --> 01:18:33.420]   There's a bunch of stuff that could be had on the cheap.
[01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:35.260]   And they have plenty of money to do.
[01:18:35.260 --> 01:18:37.700]   Well, maybe that's the secret plan
[01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:41.780]   is to get some of these dying, 25-ies-acre--
[01:18:41.780 --> 01:18:45.180]   Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg to invest in Florida
[01:18:45.180 --> 01:18:45.460]   way on the--
[01:18:45.460 --> 01:18:47.300]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:18:47.300 --> 01:18:48.980]   It's Rhonda Santis, by the way, not Rick.
[01:18:48.980 --> 01:18:52.220]   Rhonda Santis signed this earlier this week.
[01:18:52.220 --> 01:18:55.180]   And it was immediately challenged, of course,
[01:18:55.180 --> 01:18:58.260]   by a number of industry groups, including NetChoice
[01:18:58.260 --> 01:19:01.380]   and the CCIA, which represent Amazon, Google,
[01:19:01.380 --> 01:19:04.340]   Intel, Samsung, Facebook, and other tech giants.
[01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:06.580]   They're going to-- I think have it.
[01:19:06.580 --> 01:19:07.500]   It'll be taken down.
[01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:08.980]   And I don't think-- I think they knew that.
[01:19:08.980 --> 01:19:10.540]   I think the Santis knew it.
[01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:11.900]   I think the legislature knew it.
[01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:15.140]   That's not the point of this at all.
[01:19:15.140 --> 01:19:17.340]   Twitter might be spending some money
[01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:20.180]   to buy an amusement park with this, the $2.99 monthly
[01:19:20.180 --> 01:19:23.260]   subscription service for Twitter Blue.
[01:19:23.260 --> 01:19:24.620]   You signing up for this, Paris?
[01:19:24.620 --> 01:19:25.460]   You all excited?
[01:19:25.460 --> 01:19:27.740]   I don't even know what this is, but I will.
[01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:29.340]   Is the answer.
[01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:32.580]   I've checked Twitter twice during this current segment.
[01:19:32.580 --> 01:19:34.020]   Yes, I saw you.
[01:19:34.020 --> 01:19:39.140]   You were directing people to a pottery place.
[01:19:39.140 --> 01:19:40.420]   Somebody who's pots for plants.
[01:19:40.420 --> 01:19:41.220]   Now, aren't you tracking Brooklyn?
[01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:42.140]   It's really great.
[01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:43.460]   Oh, I was directing someone.
[01:19:43.460 --> 01:19:44.780]   That's a different pottery.
[01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:49.460]   There's a great plant store called Nati Garden in Brooklyn.
[01:19:49.460 --> 01:19:52.620]   One of my friends, Davie Alba, at the Times,
[01:19:52.620 --> 01:19:55.340]   apparently home depot in Brooklyn's out of terracotta plants.
[01:19:55.340 --> 01:19:57.060]   So I had to give her the hookup.
[01:19:57.060 --> 01:19:57.700]   Well, wait a minute.
[01:19:57.700 --> 01:19:59.220]   Let me check the timestamp on this.
[01:19:59.220 --> 01:20:00.900]   You did this six minutes ago?
[01:20:00.900 --> 01:20:01.860]   Wait a minute.
[01:20:01.860 --> 01:20:02.860]   Yes.
[01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:03.500]   I don't see much.
[01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:04.900]   That was actually during the break.
[01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:05.540]   Oh, OK.
[01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:06.540]   You're having more less of.
[01:20:06.540 --> 01:20:10.740]   That's what those ads are for, for you to tweet.
[01:20:10.740 --> 01:20:11.260]   I know.
[01:20:11.260 --> 01:20:12.260]   I'm taking it back.
[01:20:12.260 --> 01:20:14.540]   I'm taking it back to the United States.
[01:20:14.540 --> 01:20:19.580]   So the idea, I guess, we've heard it being floated around,
[01:20:19.580 --> 01:20:22.700]   but it's been confirmed because it is an in-app purchase
[01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:25.660]   listed in the app store on iOS.
[01:20:25.660 --> 01:20:29.780]   Twitter blew it, evens called Twitter blue $2.99.
[01:20:29.780 --> 01:20:35.420]   We don't know exactly why or what you would get for $2.99.
[01:20:35.420 --> 01:20:36.540]   Some say you'll get--
[01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:37.780]   Apparently you can undo tweets.
[01:20:37.780 --> 01:20:39.660]   Undo tweets.
[01:20:39.660 --> 01:20:43.620]   You know, how is that different from just deleting a tweet?
[01:20:43.620 --> 01:20:49.300]   Because you might wish no one had even seen it, ever.
[01:20:49.300 --> 01:20:50.500]   In fact, most of you--
[01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:52.180]   Other people's replies do.
[01:20:52.180 --> 01:20:54.100]   It gives you one of those countdown things.
[01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:54.740]   That's all it is.
[01:20:54.740 --> 01:20:57.540]   You don't really-- it's like Gmail we're taking back mail.
[01:20:57.540 --> 01:21:02.020]   You don't actually send it until the countdown is over.
[01:21:02.020 --> 01:21:03.780]   Honestly, that's an incredible feature, though.
[01:21:03.780 --> 01:21:06.900]   I've used that on Send Many.
[01:21:06.900 --> 01:21:07.860]   They'll be a reader mode.
[01:21:07.860 --> 01:21:10.380]   Rather just have an edit button.
[01:21:10.380 --> 01:21:11.540]   Nope, that got to happen.
[01:21:11.540 --> 01:21:16.660]   There'll be a reader mode that makes it easier to read long threads.
[01:21:16.660 --> 01:21:17.180]   There's thread mode.
[01:21:17.180 --> 01:21:20.940]   I just want a built-in feature to auto-delete my tweets.
[01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:23.260]   I understand that it may be counter to Twitter's whole thing,
[01:21:23.260 --> 01:21:29.140]   but I'd paid $10.99 for an auto, like a built-in tweet tweet.
[01:21:29.140 --> 01:21:32.980]   I've used third-party tools to do that.
[01:21:32.980 --> 01:21:35.300]   Yeah, same, but you have to--
[01:21:35.300 --> 01:21:35.740]   It's hard.
[01:21:35.740 --> 01:21:37.220]   You ever change your two-fact?
[01:21:37.220 --> 01:21:38.700]   You have to reset it on something.
[01:21:38.700 --> 01:21:39.580]   It's rate limited.
[01:21:39.580 --> 01:21:40.740]   It takes time.
[01:21:40.740 --> 01:21:42.460]   Doesn't get everything.
[01:21:42.460 --> 01:21:44.460]   That's kind of like back in the old days when
[01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:45.820]   we used to get phone books.
[01:21:45.820 --> 01:21:48.460]   And if you wanted your phone number to be unlisted,
[01:21:48.460 --> 01:21:52.180]   you had to pay the phone company an extra $3 a month
[01:21:52.180 --> 01:21:52.780]   to be unlisted.
[01:21:52.780 --> 01:21:54.660]   I think I'm still paying $3 a month.
[01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:56.140]   I don't even have a phone.
[01:21:56.140 --> 01:21:58.140]   So I should probably check that subscription.
[01:21:58.140 --> 01:21:59.580]   You should probably ask.
[01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:02.820]   Now they have that online with all those websites.
[01:22:02.820 --> 01:22:03.660]   Do not call.
[01:22:03.660 --> 01:22:04.140]   Yeah, they do not.
[01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:05.940]   Find my--
[01:22:05.940 --> 01:22:07.740]   If you want to get your phone number and address--
[01:22:07.740 --> 01:22:09.780]   But you've got to do them one by one, right?
[01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:11.180]   Oh, and it's very annoying.
[01:22:11.180 --> 01:22:13.580]   And most of them, you have to call a live person
[01:22:13.580 --> 01:22:15.340]   and then talk to them really bad.
[01:22:15.340 --> 01:22:16.100]   I just give up.
[01:22:16.100 --> 01:22:17.060]   That's why I give up.
[01:22:17.060 --> 01:22:19.540]   Anybody wants to know anything about me.
[01:22:19.540 --> 01:22:21.180]   Fine.
[01:22:21.180 --> 01:22:23.020]   Pack his nest camera with him.
[01:22:23.020 --> 01:22:24.100]   Hey, stop it.
[01:22:24.100 --> 01:22:24.940]   You don't have to hack it.
[01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:26.620]   I've given out the password online.
[01:22:26.620 --> 01:22:28.100]   It's on sidewalk.
[01:22:28.100 --> 01:22:29.620]   It's on sidewalk.
[01:22:29.620 --> 01:22:32.380]   Just go sit on the sidewalk and tap into the--
[01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:34.460]   Just ask the pedal I'm a PD for the tapes.
[01:22:34.460 --> 01:22:36.780]   They'll send them to you.
[01:22:36.780 --> 01:22:39.900]   You also get new color themes to choose from.
[01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:42.580]   Custom app icons.
[01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:44.820]   This is really just like what we did with Club Twit.
[01:22:44.820 --> 01:22:46.380]   I mean, we give you stuff.
[01:22:46.380 --> 01:22:47.180]   There's ad-free.
[01:22:47.180 --> 01:22:49.060]   And there's a Twit plus feed.
[01:22:49.060 --> 01:22:50.580]   There's the Discord, which actually turns out
[01:22:50.580 --> 01:22:51.740]   to really be of value.
[01:22:51.740 --> 01:22:54.380]   But honestly, it's just a way to support Twit.
[01:22:54.380 --> 01:22:56.900]   And I think that's what Twitter blue is, or blue
[01:22:56.900 --> 01:22:57.500]   whatever it is.
[01:22:57.500 --> 01:22:59.220]   There were better search features.
[01:22:59.220 --> 01:22:59.740]   I'd pick--
[01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:01.340]   It's all little to minimalist stuff.
[01:23:01.340 --> 01:23:02.860]   No.
[01:23:02.860 --> 01:23:04.580]   But really, it's just because you use Twitter.
[01:23:04.580 --> 01:23:05.100]   There's so many things.
[01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:06.460]   Yeah, you say I love Twitter.
[01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:07.580]   I'll give you three bucks.
[01:23:07.580 --> 01:23:08.580]   Yeah.
[01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:09.500]   Yeah.
[01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:10.540]   It is interesting to me.
[01:23:10.540 --> 01:23:12.820]   It's one of the really terrible ads I get on Twitter
[01:23:12.820 --> 01:23:13.940]   that I might just do.
[01:23:13.940 --> 01:23:16.700]   They don't say anything about no ads.
[01:23:16.700 --> 01:23:18.220]   So that's the thing.
[01:23:18.220 --> 01:23:21.940]   It's interesting to me about how tiny they're going with this.
[01:23:21.940 --> 01:23:23.380]   So it's $2.99, right?
[01:23:23.380 --> 01:23:25.340]   And they're basically giving you skins,
[01:23:25.340 --> 01:23:28.340]   like this is Fortnite or something like that.
[01:23:28.340 --> 01:23:29.460]   I want to dance move.
[01:23:29.460 --> 01:23:31.380]   I want at least I want to dance move.
[01:23:31.380 --> 01:23:33.860]   But I mean, what we're saying and what you're joking about
[01:23:33.860 --> 01:23:36.660]   is that we're all Twitter power users.
[01:23:36.660 --> 01:23:39.380]   So that's what Twitter's--
[01:23:39.380 --> 01:23:41.060]   Twitter gave up the ghost of trying
[01:23:41.060 --> 01:23:44.420]   to be a new Facebook a long, long time ago.
[01:23:44.420 --> 01:23:47.700]   They just have a super committed core.
[01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:49.420]   So why don't you just--
[01:23:49.420 --> 01:23:50.340]   Charge them.
[01:23:50.340 --> 01:23:52.780]   Charge through the nose for the super committed core.
[01:23:52.780 --> 01:23:53.740]   Yeah.
[01:23:53.740 --> 01:23:58.660]   Well, there's 350 million monthly active users.
[01:23:58.660 --> 01:24:03.340]   If 10% pay $3 a month, that's a good jillion bucks.
[01:24:03.340 --> 01:24:07.820]   But what I'm saying is if a half of 1%
[01:24:07.820 --> 01:24:10.900]   were willing to pay $20 a month to get rid of ads--
[01:24:10.900 --> 01:24:11.860]   Get them.
[01:24:11.860 --> 01:24:12.580]   Yeah.
[01:24:12.580 --> 01:24:13.860]   Yeah.
[01:24:13.860 --> 01:24:16.140]   I tell you, we're very happy with Club Twitch
[01:24:16.140 --> 01:24:18.780]   because there are people who say, I don't want to add--
[01:24:18.780 --> 01:24:19.820]   or I don't want to be tracked.
[01:24:19.820 --> 01:24:21.580]   That's another big one.
[01:24:21.580 --> 01:24:23.980]   And so they pay $7 a month.
[01:24:23.980 --> 01:24:24.660]   They get ad-free.
[01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:26.100]   And what it really turned out to be
[01:24:26.100 --> 01:24:30.620]   is a really great community in the Discord server, which
[01:24:30.620 --> 01:24:31.980]   is a lot of fun.
[01:24:31.980 --> 01:24:34.740]   But honestly, it's just a way to support something you like.
[01:24:34.740 --> 01:24:36.140]   And you want to support--
[01:24:36.140 --> 01:24:39.420]   I would pay $15 a month for an ad-free Twitter that
[01:24:39.420 --> 01:24:43.340]   had drastically improved search options.
[01:24:43.340 --> 01:24:44.300]   Well, they took out--
[01:24:44.300 --> 01:24:45.300]   They took out track.
[01:24:45.300 --> 01:24:46.100]   --searching through--
[01:24:46.100 --> 01:24:47.100]   Yeah.
[01:24:47.100 --> 01:24:49.220]   I find searching through Twitter ends up
[01:24:49.220 --> 01:24:51.180]   being valuable for reporting sometimes.
[01:24:51.180 --> 01:24:55.900]   But if I could actually search with any specificity
[01:24:55.900 --> 01:24:58.260]   and without it being incredibly difficult,
[01:24:58.260 --> 01:24:59.300]   I would pay a lot of money for that.
[01:24:59.300 --> 01:25:01.740]   I'd pay a buck $50 a month if they make sure they never
[01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:03.300]   bring Trump back.
[01:25:03.300 --> 01:25:04.500]   That'd be worse than--
[01:25:04.500 --> 01:25:05.100]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:05.100 --> 01:25:06.500]   --just by itself.
[01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:06.980]   No more--
[01:25:06.980 --> 01:25:08.940]   If you can pay to block other people--
[01:25:08.940 --> 01:25:09.940]   No more on streets.
[01:25:09.940 --> 01:25:10.740]   --that's on that kind of boomy.
[01:25:10.740 --> 01:25:13.060]   Oh, yeah.
[01:25:13.060 --> 01:25:18.220]   If 100,000 people pay us $5, we'll block Leo.
[01:25:18.220 --> 01:25:20.220]   That would be your money in the bank.
[01:25:20.220 --> 01:25:20.860]   Absolutely.
[01:25:20.860 --> 01:25:22.300]   Yeah, you could do a stonleow where
[01:25:22.300 --> 01:25:24.700]   if listeners wanted you to be offline for the week,
[01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:26.140]   everybody could just pay $5.
[01:25:26.140 --> 01:25:27.700]   Yeah.
[01:25:27.700 --> 01:25:27.980]   No.
[01:25:27.980 --> 01:25:28.900]   Make a kill.
[01:25:28.900 --> 01:25:29.740]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:29.740 --> 01:25:31.260]   Well, if they gave Leo a--
[01:25:31.260 --> 01:25:33.260]   If they gave Leo a cut--
[01:25:33.260 --> 01:25:35.300]   Yeah, who are they paying the $5 to?
[01:25:35.300 --> 01:25:35.820]   You!
[01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:37.660]   They'll pay you $5 to keep on the off.
[01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:38.300]   Oh, yeah, I'll do that.
[01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:38.700]   Sure, why not?
[01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:39.620]   I'll log off.
[01:25:39.620 --> 01:25:40.660]   Thank you very much.
[01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:42.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:42.980 --> 01:25:44.180]   Let's see, what else?
[01:25:44.180 --> 01:25:48.180]   How about-- let's talk about the F-150.
[01:25:48.180 --> 01:25:52.180]   This is actually a big deal, the electric Ford F-150,
[01:25:52.180 --> 01:25:55.860]   because this is the most popular truck in America.
[01:25:55.860 --> 01:25:56.860]   I think it is.
[01:25:56.860 --> 01:25:59.300]   The F-series is the most popular vehicle
[01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:01.100]   of any kind in America.
[01:26:01.100 --> 01:26:01.460]   Wow.
[01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:03.620]   And it has been for 40 years.
[01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:04.220]   Wow.
[01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:07.460]   They sell Ford sells more F-series than anything--
[01:26:07.460 --> 01:26:09.100]   any other type of vehicle.
[01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:12.460]   In fact, they say that the F-series alone,
[01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:16.740]   if that was a separate business by itself,
[01:26:16.740 --> 01:26:20.820]   that would be a $42 billion a year business in revenue,
[01:26:20.820 --> 01:26:24.300]   which is bigger than a lot of companies.
[01:26:24.300 --> 01:26:27.220]   So making an all-electric version of it
[01:26:27.220 --> 01:26:31.780]   is this for doing what the government wants it to do,
[01:26:31.780 --> 01:26:34.940]   or do they see this as a way to transition?
[01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:37.540]   I see, GM says we're going electric.
[01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:39.580]   Volkswagen says we're going electric.
[01:26:39.580 --> 01:26:41.820]   How much of that is--
[01:26:41.820 --> 01:26:43.620]   because they think there's demand for it.
[01:26:43.620 --> 01:26:45.900]   It doesn't seem like there's a lot of consumer demand for it.
[01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:46.660]   I'll be honest.
[01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:49.460]   Especially among the truck driving public.
[01:26:49.460 --> 01:26:49.900]   Yeah.
[01:26:49.900 --> 01:26:53.940]   Well, we don't really know what the demand is
[01:26:53.940 --> 01:26:55.660]   from the truck driving public, because there's never
[01:26:55.660 --> 01:26:59.300]   been an electric truck in a volume before.
[01:26:59.300 --> 01:27:01.300]   So it is an experiment in the way.
[01:27:01.300 --> 01:27:02.740]   Yeah.
[01:27:02.740 --> 01:27:05.500]   To that end, in the first week, Ford
[01:27:05.500 --> 01:27:09.860]   had something like 70,000 reservations for the F-150
[01:27:09.860 --> 01:27:10.540]   lightning.
[01:27:10.540 --> 01:27:14.140]   So yeah, I mean, it is partly driven by regulation.
[01:27:14.140 --> 01:27:16.260]   But it's also--
[01:27:16.260 --> 01:27:18.980]   they're seeing where the market is going.
[01:27:18.980 --> 01:27:20.860]   And increasingly, the market--
[01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:23.620]   it's slow, but it's creeping up.
[01:27:23.620 --> 01:27:26.060]   EV sales are creeping up steadily.
[01:27:26.060 --> 01:27:29.020]   And especially this year, we're going
[01:27:29.020 --> 01:27:31.740]   to get a whole bunch of new EVs coming into the market.
[01:27:31.740 --> 01:27:35.020]   Right now, there's about 20 EVs available
[01:27:35.020 --> 01:27:36.340]   in the US market.
[01:27:36.340 --> 01:27:38.540]   And the number of market segments
[01:27:38.540 --> 01:27:39.660]   are in is fairly limited.
[01:27:39.660 --> 01:27:41.900]   But what we're starting to see is more EVs coming
[01:27:41.900 --> 01:27:44.700]   into the segments where most people are actually
[01:27:44.700 --> 01:27:48.900]   buying vehicles like compact and mid-sized crossovers.
[01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:52.340]   And trucks, of course, Rivian's going to start deliveries.
[01:27:52.340 --> 01:27:53.900]   They've said they're going to start deliveries
[01:27:53.900 --> 01:27:54.980]   of their truck in July.
[01:27:54.980 --> 01:28:00.940]   The GMC Hummer EVs coming out later this fall,
[01:28:00.940 --> 01:28:05.300]   the F-150, next spring, at some point, possibly
[01:28:05.300 --> 01:28:08.060]   the Cybertruck from Tesla.
[01:28:08.060 --> 01:28:10.460]   And also, Chevrolet has said they're
[01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:13.340]   going to do an electric version of the Silverado,
[01:28:13.340 --> 01:28:17.620]   where the lightning is different from a lot of those others,
[01:28:17.620 --> 01:28:21.020]   except for maybe the Silverado, is Ford's really targeting
[01:28:21.020 --> 01:28:24.980]   its core customers, the most hardcore customers they have
[01:28:24.980 --> 01:28:27.340]   for that truck, which is their commercial customers.
[01:28:27.340 --> 01:28:28.780]   That's interesting, because we usually
[01:28:28.780 --> 01:28:32.540]   think of the truck driving individual as somebody who's
[01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:35.500]   not going to be interested in an electric vehicle.
[01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:39.620]   Perhaps they're rural, there's no charging stations.
[01:28:39.620 --> 01:28:43.140]   They're rolling coal, they like the idea of smoke coming out
[01:28:43.140 --> 01:28:45.140]   of the bag for whatever reason.
[01:28:45.140 --> 01:28:48.940]   But you're commercial, they may be a little bit more sensitive
[01:28:48.940 --> 01:28:52.020]   to pricing, and they may be a little easier for them
[01:28:52.020 --> 01:28:53.780]   to put in electric charging stations.
[01:28:53.780 --> 01:28:57.820]   Cheaper maintenance costs, if you have a fleet of these things.
[01:28:57.820 --> 01:29:00.860]   The other thing-- right, so again, this is not my space,
[01:29:00.860 --> 01:29:03.820]   but when I did the segment on it last week,
[01:29:03.820 --> 01:29:05.660]   that was the thing that impressed me about it,
[01:29:05.660 --> 01:29:09.180]   is that the headline was that, OK, it's got a battery
[01:29:09.180 --> 01:29:12.260]   and it could keep your house charged if you had a blackout
[01:29:12.260 --> 01:29:13.340]   for three days.
[01:29:13.340 --> 01:29:14.900]   But the other thing is, is there's
[01:29:14.900 --> 01:29:19.260]   something like seven electrical ports all over the thing,
[01:29:19.260 --> 01:29:23.700]   so that number one, if you're running a business that
[01:29:23.700 --> 01:29:25.260]   has a fleet of 30 of these things,
[01:29:25.260 --> 01:29:27.220]   and you're going to job sites and construction sites,
[01:29:27.220 --> 01:29:29.340]   not only over the course of the life of the vehicle,
[01:29:29.340 --> 01:29:30.900]   maybe is there less maintenance costs,
[01:29:30.900 --> 01:29:33.540]   but also that's useful if you can go to a job site
[01:29:33.540 --> 01:29:35.660]   and plug in all sorts of tools and things like that
[01:29:35.660 --> 01:29:38.140]   into this thing.
[01:29:38.140 --> 01:29:41.980]   And that's one of the key things that Ford is promoting.
[01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:44.580]   Last year, when they launched the hybrid version, the F-150,
[01:29:44.580 --> 01:29:46.500]   they launched this pro power on board,
[01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:49.140]   where the electric motor that's in there
[01:29:49.140 --> 01:29:49.980]   becomes a generator.
[01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:51.780]   Because for a lot of those commercial customers,
[01:29:51.780 --> 01:29:54.860]   a lot of times, they're hauling along a gas generator
[01:29:54.860 --> 01:29:55.780]   in the bed of the truck.
[01:29:55.780 --> 01:29:59.620]   So that's one more piece of gear that they've got to haul along.
[01:29:59.620 --> 01:30:02.060]   They've got to bring gas for that.
[01:30:02.060 --> 01:30:04.500]   Those things generally are polluting
[01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:06.900]   more than the engines in modern vehicles.
[01:30:06.900 --> 01:30:10.460]   So now you've got this source of electricity
[01:30:10.460 --> 01:30:12.940]   that's in the case of the lightning.
[01:30:12.940 --> 01:30:15.700]   You've got a lot of juice available.
[01:30:15.700 --> 01:30:17.140]   They did a demo.
[01:30:17.140 --> 01:30:20.100]   You can get up to 9.6 kilowatts out of this thing
[01:30:20.100 --> 01:30:23.540]   from 11 outlets, including a 240 volt outlet.
[01:30:23.540 --> 01:30:26.340]   So they had a demo running when I was there,
[01:30:26.340 --> 01:30:30.380]   showing a whole bunch of shop lights, a cement mixer,
[01:30:30.380 --> 01:30:34.100]   an air compressor, a miter saw, a bunch of other tools,
[01:30:34.100 --> 01:30:37.220]   all running at the same time, drawing off of this thing,
[01:30:37.220 --> 01:30:41.540]   which is for a contractor working in a job site
[01:30:41.540 --> 01:30:44.020]   or recharging their tools.
[01:30:44.020 --> 01:30:46.540]   That's a really important feature
[01:30:46.540 --> 01:30:49.340]   to have for those kinds of customers.
[01:30:49.340 --> 01:30:51.540]   I feel like that would be a really important feature,
[01:30:51.540 --> 01:30:54.580]   also for long haul commercial truck drivers
[01:30:54.580 --> 01:30:59.060]   or anybody who is having to live within the vehicle
[01:30:59.060 --> 01:31:00.460]   for weeks at a time,
[01:31:00.460 --> 01:31:04.580]   conveving that extra output available would be invaluable.
[01:31:04.580 --> 01:31:06.860]   - Oh, absolutely.
[01:31:06.860 --> 01:31:09.780]   The challenge with long haul trucking though
[01:31:09.780 --> 01:31:14.300]   is the battery size you need for a long haul truck
[01:31:14.300 --> 01:31:18.620]   is so large that it starts to eat into the payload
[01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:22.300]   capability of the truck, because the long haul trucking,
[01:31:22.300 --> 01:31:24.820]   they make their revenue based on
[01:31:24.820 --> 01:31:26.780]   how many pounds of freight they're carrying.
[01:31:26.780 --> 01:31:29.500]   And if you've got a 10,000 pound battery
[01:31:29.500 --> 01:31:30.900]   that you're hauling along,
[01:31:30.900 --> 01:31:34.460]   that's about 8,000 pounds more than a diesel powertrain.
[01:31:34.460 --> 01:31:37.420]   So that's 8,000 pounds less payload you can carry.
[01:31:37.420 --> 01:31:41.580]   So, the economic there are still not as big yet, but.
[01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:44.540]   - Are there not, I guess a question I had was,
[01:31:44.540 --> 01:31:48.740]   what's the saturation like of charging stations
[01:31:48.740 --> 01:31:51.180]   in America right now outside of metropolitan areas,
[01:31:51.180 --> 01:31:55.380]   especially with this Ford F-150 truck,
[01:31:55.380 --> 01:31:58.180]   appealing to rural customers, would that be harder?
[01:31:58.180 --> 01:31:59.860]   - It's growing.
[01:31:59.860 --> 01:32:03.020]   I mean, there's over 100,000 public charging stations now
[01:32:03.020 --> 01:32:06.500]   in the US, and part of the Biden infrastructure plan,
[01:32:06.500 --> 01:32:11.500]   they wanna add another 500,000 by the end of the decade.
[01:32:11.820 --> 01:32:15.540]   And from, there's probably gonna be more than that,
[01:32:15.540 --> 01:32:17.100]   by the end of this decade.
[01:32:17.100 --> 01:32:20.380]   But for a lot of the commercial customers,
[01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:23.780]   a lot of times these trucks will either be,
[01:32:23.780 --> 01:32:25.300]   they're operating in a local area,
[01:32:25.300 --> 01:32:28.260]   they're not operating long distances.
[01:32:28.260 --> 01:32:30.700]   So for the rural customers,
[01:32:30.700 --> 01:32:33.500]   maybe for somebody working on a farm,
[01:32:33.500 --> 01:32:35.140]   where they can charge at home,
[01:32:35.140 --> 01:32:38.500]   if they're driving around on the farm,
[01:32:38.500 --> 01:32:41.340]   then this truck could certainly be worthwhile for them.
[01:32:42.220 --> 01:32:43.820]   And a lot of the commercial customers
[01:32:43.820 --> 01:32:45.300]   in urban and suburban areas,
[01:32:45.300 --> 01:32:49.700]   they're driving no more than,
[01:32:49.700 --> 01:32:51.580]   I think from their telemetry data,
[01:32:51.580 --> 01:32:54.620]   Ford said that 95% of the users are driving
[01:32:54.620 --> 01:32:56.660]   less than 175 miles per day.
[01:32:56.660 --> 01:32:58.500]   - Even in a truck, that's interesting.
[01:32:58.500 --> 01:32:59.820]   - Yeah, even a truck.
[01:32:59.820 --> 01:33:01.980]   So, I mean, a lot of these carpenters,
[01:33:01.980 --> 01:33:04.380]   electricians, to the jobs that gave birth.
[01:33:04.380 --> 01:33:08.700]   And so they're returning to the same base every night,
[01:33:08.700 --> 01:33:10.460]   where they can plug in and charge,
[01:33:10.460 --> 01:33:12.220]   or in many cases, returning,
[01:33:12.220 --> 01:33:14.620]   you know, take home vehicles,
[01:33:14.620 --> 01:33:16.540]   so that the workers are using.
[01:33:16.540 --> 01:33:18.300]   - We charge with solar panels,
[01:33:18.300 --> 01:33:21.860]   so it's actually very economical once you pay for the solar panels.
[01:33:21.860 --> 01:33:25.140]   But I could see that even,
[01:33:25.140 --> 01:33:27.140]   if in a farm in a rural area,
[01:33:27.140 --> 01:33:28.340]   putting some solar panels in it
[01:33:28.340 --> 01:33:30.300]   and you charge your own truck,
[01:33:30.300 --> 01:33:31.140]   you're gonna long run,
[01:33:31.140 --> 01:33:32.820]   you're gonna save money.
[01:33:32.820 --> 01:33:34.380]   Plus it's got some real benefits.
[01:33:34.380 --> 01:33:36.540]   I mean, you've got a lot of power in that thing.
[01:33:36.540 --> 01:33:41.380]   They said, what, 300 miles with a thousand pound load?
[01:33:41.380 --> 01:33:43.340]   - Yeah, so, you know,
[01:33:43.340 --> 01:33:46.780]   and it's got a 2,000 pound payload capability.
[01:33:46.780 --> 01:33:48.180]   So, you know, with half of that,
[01:33:48.180 --> 01:33:49.740]   it can still go over 300 miles.
[01:33:49.740 --> 01:33:52.860]   And one of the interesting things that Ford recently launched
[01:33:52.860 --> 01:33:56.100]   on their regular F-150s is onboard scales.
[01:33:56.100 --> 01:33:59.580]   So they've actually got sensors underneath the bed
[01:33:59.580 --> 01:34:02.460]   or the truck between the frame and the bed,
[01:34:02.460 --> 01:34:06.540]   that as you load up the truck with stuff,
[01:34:06.540 --> 01:34:11.540]   you can actually know how much stuff you're putting in there.
[01:34:11.540 --> 01:34:15.020]   And then the range estimation system
[01:34:15.020 --> 01:34:16.420]   actually takes that into account.
[01:34:16.420 --> 01:34:17.260]   - Oh, that's cool.
[01:34:17.260 --> 01:34:22.060]   - Yeah, so when you've put 500 or 1,000 or 2,000 pounds in the truck,
[01:34:22.060 --> 01:34:24.380]   you know, it will automatically adjust your range estimate.
[01:34:24.380 --> 01:34:26.220]   So you have a more accurate range estimation.
[01:34:26.220 --> 01:34:27.940]   Or if you hook up a trailer,
[01:34:27.940 --> 01:34:30.300]   they've got a smart trailer hitch, same thing.
[01:34:30.300 --> 01:34:35.260]   It'll tell you what your real range is more likely to be.
[01:34:35.260 --> 01:34:36.940]   - That's pretty cool.
[01:34:36.940 --> 01:34:37.780]   - Yeah.
[01:34:37.780 --> 01:34:39.740]   Is it possible though, if this truck is a flop
[01:34:39.740 --> 01:34:42.220]   that they could set back the EV industry?
[01:34:42.220 --> 01:34:44.780]   - It's certainly possible.
[01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:46.420]   I don't think it will be.
[01:34:46.420 --> 01:34:48.740]   You know, I think it'll sell pretty well because, you know,
[01:34:48.740 --> 01:34:50.700]   for, as Brian mentioned, you know,
[01:34:50.700 --> 01:34:54.460]   operating costs are a big factor for commercial customers
[01:34:54.460 --> 01:34:57.220]   because they tend to drive a lot more miles.
[01:34:57.220 --> 01:35:00.540]   And it's a much bigger proportion of their total expense.
[01:35:00.540 --> 01:35:05.460]   You know, the service, fuel, you know, it's the, you know,
[01:35:05.460 --> 01:35:08.300]   is a much bigger part of the total cost of ownership.
[01:35:08.300 --> 01:35:10.540]   And when you go electric, you know,
[01:35:10.540 --> 01:35:14.660]   if it fits within your operating use case,
[01:35:14.660 --> 01:35:16.740]   then you can save a hell of a lot of money.
[01:35:16.740 --> 01:35:19.140]   And Ford is pricing this thing very aggressively.
[01:35:19.140 --> 01:35:22.340]   The base work truck version starts at $40,000
[01:35:22.340 --> 01:35:24.300]   for a four-wheel drive crew cab.
[01:35:24.300 --> 01:35:29.300]   And the equivalent gasoline version of that
[01:35:29.300 --> 01:35:31.300]   is actually $2,500 more.
[01:35:31.300 --> 01:35:33.660]   And that's before the, any tax incentives.
[01:35:33.660 --> 01:35:35.620]   So, I mean, you could potentially get one of these
[01:35:35.620 --> 01:35:37.020]   in the low $30,000.
[01:35:37.020 --> 01:35:38.480]   - Are they, that's interesting.
[01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:40.700]   Are they absorbing the costs?
[01:35:40.700 --> 01:35:43.500]   It should, the battery alone is a huge expense
[01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:45.340]   on these things, isn't it?
[01:35:45.340 --> 01:35:46.180]   - Yeah.
[01:35:46.180 --> 01:35:47.860]   - There's been a lot of, yeah,
[01:35:47.860 --> 01:35:49.900]   there's been a lot of progress on battery costs,
[01:35:49.900 --> 01:35:51.540]   bringing battery costs down.
[01:35:51.540 --> 01:35:55.500]   And so, you know, they're actually expecting this thing
[01:35:55.500 --> 01:35:56.500]   to be profitable.
[01:35:56.500 --> 01:36:00.620]   - You know, Leo, you said at the beginning that,
[01:36:00.620 --> 01:36:01.540]   "Oh, are they doing this
[01:36:01.540 --> 01:36:02.820]   'cause the government is telling them to do."
[01:36:02.820 --> 01:36:06.780]   Like, I used, I lived in Detroit for a period of time.
[01:36:06.780 --> 01:36:09.340]   And Sam and I, Offair, were talking about somebody
[01:36:09.340 --> 01:36:10.580]   in the industry that we both know.
[01:36:10.580 --> 01:36:14.340]   And my sense from the people that I still know,
[01:36:14.340 --> 01:36:16.020]   in Detroit, in the auto industry,
[01:36:16.020 --> 01:36:18.900]   they're not doing this because of any pressure.
[01:36:18.900 --> 01:36:21.700]   Like, literally everybody drank the Kool-Aid
[01:36:21.700 --> 01:36:23.140]   in the last decade or so.
[01:36:23.140 --> 01:36:24.420]   And every single one of them,
[01:36:24.420 --> 01:36:26.900]   and Sam, I'm kind of asking you this,
[01:36:26.900 --> 01:36:29.780]   like the industry believes that this is the future.
[01:36:29.780 --> 01:36:33.060]   They're skating to where they think the puck is going, right?
[01:36:33.060 --> 01:36:33.900]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[01:36:33.900 --> 01:36:36.580]   You know, the progress that's been made on batteries,
[01:36:36.580 --> 01:36:38.820]   improving the battery capabilities
[01:36:38.820 --> 01:36:41.140]   and reducing the battery cost, you know,
[01:36:41.140 --> 01:36:44.340]   has gotten to the point where they now think that,
[01:36:44.340 --> 01:36:46.060]   you know, part of the reason why they were slow
[01:36:46.060 --> 01:36:48.540]   to adopt this is because they,
[01:36:48.540 --> 01:36:50.220]   there wasn't enough consumer demand
[01:36:50.220 --> 01:36:51.860]   and the cost was too high
[01:36:51.860 --> 01:36:54.220]   and they couldn't make a business case for it.
[01:36:54.220 --> 01:36:56.020]   But now that's flipped around.
[01:36:56.020 --> 01:36:57.620]   You know, they're at the point
[01:36:57.620 --> 01:36:59.660]   where they're starting to be able to make these things
[01:36:59.660 --> 01:37:01.420]   profitably.
[01:37:01.420 --> 01:37:03.380]   And in some cases, like the F-150, you know,
[01:37:03.380 --> 01:37:05.740]   they also use, there's a lot of shared
[01:37:05.740 --> 01:37:07.500]   componentry with the regular F-150.
[01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:11.060]   So they've got a lot of scale, you know, right off the bat.
[01:37:11.060 --> 01:37:13.220]   And they really do believe that, you know,
[01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:16.780]   there's a solid business case for these things.
[01:37:16.780 --> 01:37:19.180]   And so they're going all in on electric.
[01:37:19.180 --> 01:37:21.780]   You know, almost every major automaker
[01:37:21.780 --> 01:37:23.500]   is going down this path
[01:37:23.500 --> 01:37:26.820]   and including getting into building their own batteries.
[01:37:26.820 --> 01:37:29.380]   You know, they're, instead of buying them from suppliers,
[01:37:29.380 --> 01:37:31.700]   building their own batteries in house, you know,
[01:37:31.700 --> 01:37:33.660]   Ford's doing it, GM's doing it,
[01:37:33.660 --> 01:37:36.340]   Volkswagen's doing it, Stellantis is doing it.
[01:37:36.340 --> 01:37:39.140]   You know, most of the major automakers are going down this path.
[01:37:39.140 --> 01:37:40.540]   - It's funny, I guess I'm a,
[01:37:40.540 --> 01:37:43.380]   so on the one hand, I love electric vehicles.
[01:37:43.380 --> 01:37:45.700]   I like driving them and I've owned a number of them.
[01:37:45.700 --> 01:37:48.420]   We have a Bolt, we have a Mustang from Ford,
[01:37:48.420 --> 01:37:51.700]   we have a, I had a Tesla.
[01:37:51.700 --> 01:37:52.820]   So I like them personally,
[01:37:52.820 --> 01:37:56.940]   but I also feel like there's a very strong anti-EV sentiment
[01:37:56.940 --> 01:38:00.260]   in the country and there's a lot of skepticism about EVs.
[01:38:00.260 --> 01:38:03.060]   And it seems to me that the biggest segment is the,
[01:38:03.060 --> 01:38:05.620]   of skeptics is the truck driving public.
[01:38:05.620 --> 01:38:07.380]   So I'll be watching with the great interest.
[01:38:07.380 --> 01:38:08.820]   I have to say it does seem like,
[01:38:08.820 --> 01:38:11.100]   I mean, you're starting to see more and more charging stations.
[01:38:11.100 --> 01:38:13.420]   Our little town here in Petaluma became the first
[01:38:13.420 --> 01:38:17.700]   in the nation to ban new construction of gas stations,
[01:38:17.700 --> 01:38:20.100]   which I think is probably a good thing.
[01:38:20.100 --> 01:38:22.540]   And I noticed that every single office park
[01:38:22.540 --> 01:38:25.140]   in our neighborhood is putting in chargers.
[01:38:25.140 --> 01:38:27.380]   So when you get to work, you can charge your vehicle
[01:38:27.380 --> 01:38:29.140]   and see more and more of those.
[01:38:29.140 --> 01:38:31.300]   So I, maybe the world is changing.
[01:38:31.300 --> 01:38:33.740]   I just, I feel skeptical, I like it,
[01:38:33.740 --> 01:38:35.100]   but I feel like this is-
[01:38:35.100 --> 01:38:37.460]   - Well, no, I think right Leo-
[01:38:37.460 --> 01:38:38.300]   - Go ahead, go ahead.
[01:38:38.300 --> 01:38:41.180]   - And aren't there countries around the world
[01:38:41.180 --> 01:38:44.140]   that have passed laws that like by 2030 and 2040?
[01:38:44.140 --> 01:38:45.140]   - Well, that, yeah, sure,
[01:38:45.140 --> 01:38:46.100]   - Sure, in our way and so forth.
[01:38:46.100 --> 01:38:47.500]   But also, somebody in the chair-
[01:38:47.500 --> 01:38:48.700]   - But they're not by many pickup trucks though.
[01:38:48.700 --> 01:38:49.540]   - Right.
[01:38:49.540 --> 01:38:50.380]   - Somebody's saying that this is,
[01:38:50.380 --> 01:38:52.660]   that China is the country that these countries,
[01:38:52.660 --> 01:38:54.180]   the companies are really paying attention to.
[01:38:54.180 --> 01:38:55.660]   Is that the case?
[01:38:55.660 --> 01:38:59.540]   - Yeah, China and Europe both are where the big EV growth
[01:38:59.540 --> 01:39:04.380]   has been, but Leo, you were mentioning,
[01:39:04.380 --> 01:39:07.660]   there's still a lot of people that don't like EVs.
[01:39:07.660 --> 01:39:09.660]   And that's true.
[01:39:09.660 --> 01:39:12.620]   There is a certain portion of the population
[01:39:12.620 --> 01:39:14.820]   that thinks it's a terrible idea.
[01:39:14.820 --> 01:39:16.300]   But for, I think for a lot of people,
[01:39:16.300 --> 01:39:18.540]   they make a lot of sense, and especially for businesses.
[01:39:18.540 --> 01:39:22.020]   And this is why Ford, they started with the Mach-E
[01:39:22.020 --> 01:39:23.540]   to generate some excitement.
[01:39:23.540 --> 01:39:26.020]   But their next two EVs are an electric version
[01:39:26.020 --> 01:39:29.020]   of the transit van, an electric version of the F-150.
[01:39:29.020 --> 01:39:30.300]   Because they know that businesses-
[01:39:30.300 --> 01:39:31.620]   - Those are the sleek vehicles.
[01:39:31.620 --> 01:39:34.180]   - Look at this from a very different perspective
[01:39:34.180 --> 01:39:35.700]   than consumers do.
[01:39:35.700 --> 01:39:36.540]   And so-
[01:39:36.540 --> 01:39:38.700]   - A lot of attention paid at a low maintenance cost,
[01:39:38.700 --> 01:39:40.900]   but really electric motors require very little maintenance.
[01:39:40.900 --> 01:39:44.180]   And in fact, these electric cars are much less complex
[01:39:44.180 --> 01:39:46.940]   than ice vehicles, internal combustion engines.
[01:39:46.940 --> 01:39:50.260]   So really they are much better from the point of view of-
[01:39:50.260 --> 01:39:53.300]   - Sam, is it also a generational thing where like,
[01:39:53.300 --> 01:39:56.980]   they've done like the consumer polling and stuff like this,
[01:39:56.980 --> 01:40:00.220]   and they're like, well, by the way, the Gen Z's
[01:40:00.220 --> 01:40:04.980]   and beyond, they're gonna buy, they want electric vehicles.
[01:40:04.980 --> 01:40:07.660]   So this is again, like sort of like any other company
[01:40:07.660 --> 01:40:09.180]   where it's like, well, we're making these decisions
[01:40:09.180 --> 01:40:11.780]   because we wanna get the 18 to 35 year olds,
[01:40:11.780 --> 01:40:13.820]   is that part of the thinking too?
[01:40:13.820 --> 01:40:15.780]   - That is definitely part of the thinking.
[01:40:15.780 --> 01:40:19.660]   They're looking at the changing market demographics
[01:40:19.660 --> 01:40:22.180]   and all these other factors.
[01:40:22.180 --> 01:40:24.660]   And there's a fairly long lead time
[01:40:24.660 --> 01:40:25.820]   to develop a new vehicle.
[01:40:25.820 --> 01:40:27.540]   So the things they're doing now,
[01:40:27.540 --> 01:40:30.500]   they're planning for the next five and 10 years.
[01:40:30.500 --> 01:40:33.780]   And that's part of what I do in my day job
[01:40:33.780 --> 01:40:37.140]   is forecasting this stuff and working with companies
[01:40:37.140 --> 01:40:39.140]   to help them figure out their strategies.
[01:40:39.140 --> 01:40:42.420]   - I get regular emails from listeners and viewers who say,
[01:40:42.420 --> 01:40:46.940]   "Oh, Leo, you think electric cars are more eco-friendly,
[01:40:46.940 --> 01:40:47.740]   but they're not."
[01:40:47.740 --> 01:40:50.900]   There's, what about lithium mining and recycling batteries
[01:40:50.900 --> 01:40:52.940]   and what about the power you're using
[01:40:52.940 --> 01:40:55.500]   because it comes from a coal-fired plant.
[01:40:55.500 --> 01:40:58.300]   I get that constantly.
[01:40:58.300 --> 01:41:00.900]   I think there's a very strong drum beat of people saying,
[01:41:00.900 --> 01:41:04.340]   EVs are not as eco-friendly as they pretend to be.
[01:41:04.340 --> 01:41:05.700]   What's the truth on that?
[01:41:07.060 --> 01:41:09.900]   - It does take more energy to produce an EV
[01:41:09.900 --> 01:41:12.860]   than it does to produce an internal combustion vehicle.
[01:41:12.860 --> 01:41:16.900]   But over its lifespan, if you look at the full life cycle
[01:41:16.900 --> 01:41:21.780]   from raw materials to completely end of life,
[01:41:21.780 --> 01:41:24.820]   the overall emissions are significantly lower.
[01:41:24.820 --> 01:41:27.740]   Even with coal-fired power
[01:41:27.740 --> 01:41:31.060]   and coal-fired power is significantly in decline.
[01:41:31.060 --> 01:41:31.900]   - Yeah.
[01:41:31.900 --> 01:41:35.140]   - But let's say fossil fuel-powered plants,
[01:41:35.140 --> 01:41:36.860]   which are still a majority.
[01:41:36.860 --> 01:41:38.860]   But even then, they're putting strawberries on those stacks.
[01:41:38.860 --> 01:41:42.900]   They can do a lot to reduce emissions from those plants
[01:41:42.900 --> 01:41:48.740]   at one single source than the tailpipes of 100,000 cars.
[01:41:48.740 --> 01:41:51.100]   - And we're getting a lot more renewables all the time.
[01:41:51.100 --> 01:41:53.500]   There's more solar, more wind going in all the time.
[01:41:53.500 --> 01:41:57.500]   - Well, as I said, I have 60 solar panels on my roof.
[01:41:57.500 --> 01:42:01.100]   So I'm generating as much more of the electricity
[01:42:01.100 --> 01:42:02.740]   than we use.
[01:42:02.740 --> 01:42:05.700]   So I feel all right about that, but still.
[01:42:05.700 --> 01:42:07.700]   - And the other thing about recycling,
[01:42:07.700 --> 01:42:11.140]   they're also making a lot of progress on battery recycling.
[01:42:11.140 --> 01:42:16.140]   And as the number of EVs available,
[01:42:16.140 --> 01:42:19.060]   they're in use goes up.
[01:42:19.060 --> 01:42:21.340]   There's also opportunities for second life uses
[01:42:21.340 --> 01:42:22.180]   of those batteries.
[01:42:22.180 --> 01:42:26.220]   So once maybe the batteries only got 65, 70%
[01:42:26.220 --> 01:42:29.060]   of its original capacity left, you take it out of a car,
[01:42:29.060 --> 01:42:32.420]   you stick it in a rack and use it for stationary storage
[01:42:32.420 --> 01:42:34.580]   at those DC fast charging stations,
[01:42:34.580 --> 01:42:36.020]   you put in stationary storage there,
[01:42:36.020 --> 01:42:39.060]   so you don't need as much incoming electrical capacity.
[01:42:39.060 --> 01:42:41.140]   And you charge up those batteries slowly,
[01:42:41.140 --> 01:42:43.740]   and then you charge the vehicles fast from the batteries.
[01:42:43.740 --> 01:42:46.780]   Or for grid balancing, there's all kinds of ways
[01:42:46.780 --> 01:42:47.620]   you can use those.
[01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:52.620]   And then recycling, VW has a pilot battery recycling plant
[01:42:52.620 --> 01:42:56.380]   in Germany right now, they're able to recover 95%
[01:42:56.380 --> 01:42:59.220]   of the key raw materials, the cobalt, the lithium,
[01:42:59.220 --> 01:43:02.980]   the manganese, the aluminum from those cells.
[01:43:02.980 --> 01:43:06.980]   And they basically just drop the entire battery module
[01:43:06.980 --> 01:43:09.620]   into what looks like a giant paper shredder,
[01:43:09.620 --> 01:43:12.140]   and it shreds it down into little strips.
[01:43:12.140 --> 01:43:14.260]   And then they process that,
[01:43:14.260 --> 01:43:16.260]   and they can get back most of those raw materials,
[01:43:16.260 --> 01:43:18.980]   which is gonna be key to making this transition,
[01:43:18.980 --> 01:43:23.180]   because we don't have enough processing capacity
[01:43:23.180 --> 01:43:24.820]   for all the raw materials yet.
[01:43:24.820 --> 01:43:26.380]   - Yeah, and this isn't gonna happen overnight,
[01:43:26.380 --> 01:43:29.340]   so people are saying if everybody had electric vehicle,
[01:43:29.340 --> 01:43:32.780]   we'd have to fire up those coal power plants again.
[01:43:32.780 --> 01:43:34.300]   - But this isn't gonna happen overnight,
[01:43:34.300 --> 01:43:36.700]   this is gonna be a transition.
[01:43:36.700 --> 01:43:40.780]   And I think it's gonna start with fleets, frankly,
[01:43:40.780 --> 01:43:42.420]   and places where it makes a lot of sense.
[01:43:42.420 --> 01:43:43.260]   Yeah.
[01:43:43.260 --> 01:43:48.420]   From the information, solar winds hackers launching new attacks,
[01:43:48.420 --> 01:43:50.020]   actually it's coming from Microsoft,
[01:43:50.020 --> 01:43:53.100]   we'll talk about that in just a little bit with our guests,
[01:43:53.100 --> 01:43:55.420]   from the information Paris, Martin, no.
[01:43:55.420 --> 01:43:57.180]   See, I'm really making it harder and harder
[01:43:57.180 --> 01:43:59.180]   for the information to buy ads on Twitter and I,
[01:43:59.180 --> 01:44:00.020]   they just know--
[01:44:00.020 --> 01:44:01.660]   - It's true, you're just cheating yourself out of money.
[01:44:01.660 --> 01:44:03.380]   - No point whatsoever.
[01:44:03.380 --> 01:44:05.100]   (laughing)
[01:44:05.100 --> 01:44:06.180]   It's always good. - Or poor back,
[01:44:06.180 --> 01:44:07.260]   I'll say never give any money on them.
[01:44:07.260 --> 01:44:08.340]   - Never give a mess.
[01:44:08.340 --> 01:44:10.020]   Why should you?
[01:44:10.020 --> 01:44:11.500]   We love the information.
[01:44:11.500 --> 01:44:12.940]   I'm happy to be a subscriber.
[01:44:12.940 --> 01:44:14.820]   It's great to have you, Paris.
[01:44:14.820 --> 01:44:17.100]   It's also great to have Brian McCullough,
[01:44:17.100 --> 01:44:18.220]   the Tech meme Ride Home.
[01:44:18.220 --> 01:44:22.100]   I'm also a regular on Tech meme and the Ride Home podcast.
[01:44:22.100 --> 01:44:23.940]   Nice to have you and Samable.
[01:44:23.940 --> 01:44:28.940]   Sam, as you can tell, my car guy from Guidehouse,
[01:44:30.660 --> 01:44:31.980]   put up his lower third 'cause I can never remember.
[01:44:31.980 --> 01:44:33.620]   - Guidehouse Insights. - Thank you, guy.
[01:44:33.620 --> 01:44:34.980]   They changed the name on me.
[01:44:34.980 --> 01:44:36.740]   Guidehouse Insights. (laughing)
[01:44:36.740 --> 01:44:37.820]   Thank you.
[01:44:37.820 --> 01:44:39.580]   And the Wheelbhering's podcast.
[01:44:39.580 --> 01:44:42.580]   I showed it a broad to you by podium.
[01:44:42.580 --> 01:44:44.660]   You know, it's funny, in the 90s,
[01:44:44.660 --> 01:44:46.780]   your business had to have, if you were gonna be modern,
[01:44:46.780 --> 01:44:48.820]   and you had to have an email address, right?
[01:44:48.820 --> 01:44:52.340]   By the 2000s, you had to have a website.
[01:44:52.340 --> 01:44:55.300]   By 2010, you had to have a Twitter account
[01:44:55.300 --> 01:44:57.420]   or a Facebook account.
[01:44:57.420 --> 01:44:58.860]   In 2021, I'm telling you,
[01:44:58.860 --> 01:45:01.380]   your business needs to be texting.
[01:45:01.380 --> 01:45:03.540]   You need podium.
[01:45:03.540 --> 01:45:06.300]   It's the easiest, fastest, simplest way
[01:45:06.300 --> 01:45:10.740]   to add texting to your communications with your customers.
[01:45:10.740 --> 01:45:12.980]   And by the way, and I'll say it for myself,
[01:45:12.980 --> 01:45:17.180]   customers prefer texts to emails or phone calls.
[01:45:17.180 --> 01:45:20.500]   It's just the easiest way to stay in touch.
[01:45:20.500 --> 01:45:24.060]   podium is a messaging platform that will power your business.
[01:45:24.060 --> 01:45:25.380]   It helps you reach your customers
[01:45:25.380 --> 01:45:26.540]   where they wanna be reached.
[01:45:26.540 --> 01:45:28.660]   Business messaging with podium.
[01:45:28.660 --> 01:45:32.540]   Could be used to gain reviews, to collect payments,
[01:45:32.540 --> 01:45:36.340]   to communicate with customers, to offer them coupons,
[01:45:36.340 --> 01:45:38.380]   to welcome them back, to invite them back,
[01:45:38.380 --> 01:45:40.460]   to capture leads, and all from one inbox,
[01:45:40.460 --> 01:45:43.300]   which is really great, your employees will love that.
[01:45:43.300 --> 01:45:46.700]   podium helps you adapt to the changing world
[01:45:46.700 --> 01:45:48.020]   of communications.
[01:45:48.020 --> 01:45:49.820]   It's constantly changing.
[01:45:49.820 --> 01:45:52.300]   And I will say, and I don't know,
[01:45:52.300 --> 01:45:54.380]   you know, if I'm an early adopter, I think I'm not.
[01:45:54.380 --> 01:45:56.540]   I think this is pretty much universal.
[01:45:56.540 --> 01:45:58.180]   If I find out a business context,
[01:45:58.180 --> 01:45:59.540]   I'm gonna use that.
[01:45:59.540 --> 01:46:00.580]   It's just easier for me.
[01:46:00.580 --> 01:46:04.580]   I'd much prefer to make an appointment with my hairdresser,
[01:46:04.580 --> 01:46:07.780]   to give a review to my dentist when it comes through a text.
[01:46:07.780 --> 01:46:09.220]   In fact, it happened to me the other day.
[01:46:09.220 --> 01:46:10.740]   I left the dentist's office,
[01:46:10.740 --> 01:46:13.180]   and they said, "Hey, leave us a review."
[01:46:13.180 --> 01:46:16.140]   And because the link was right there, it was very easy.
[01:46:16.140 --> 01:46:17.180]   I did it.
[01:46:17.180 --> 01:46:19.620]   podium is really great for local businesses,
[01:46:19.620 --> 01:46:21.900]   for small businesses, for tennis offices,
[01:46:21.900 --> 01:46:24.660]   and stores and salons with podium reviews.
[01:46:24.660 --> 01:46:26.460]   You can easily text customers
[01:46:26.460 --> 01:46:29.100]   to get them to leave an online review.
[01:46:29.100 --> 01:46:31.140]   And that'll really help in so many ways.
[01:46:31.140 --> 01:46:32.180]   It will search results.
[01:46:32.180 --> 01:46:34.340]   It'll drive customers.
[01:46:34.340 --> 01:46:37.340]   You know, 98% of text messages are open.
[01:46:37.340 --> 01:46:41.020]   98%, that's compared to 20% of emails.
[01:46:41.020 --> 01:46:43.660]   That's in fact exactly how South Tampa Family
[01:46:43.660 --> 01:46:45.980]   and Cosmetic Dentistry used it.
[01:46:45.980 --> 01:46:49.020]   Dr. Wyatt down there said they were able to generate
[01:46:49.020 --> 01:46:51.700]   1200 reviews with podium.
[01:46:51.700 --> 01:46:53.380]   And by the way, must be pretty good.
[01:46:53.380 --> 01:46:55.100]   They got 4.9 stars.
[01:46:55.100 --> 01:46:56.940]   Dr. Wyatt said the number of walk-ins
[01:46:56.940 --> 01:46:59.900]   as a result of our reviews is skyrocketed
[01:46:59.900 --> 01:47:02.660]   before we were seeing maybe 50 to 100 new patients a month.
[01:47:02.660 --> 01:47:05.660]   Now we're seeing closer to 200 a month.
[01:47:05.660 --> 01:47:07.140]   You can do it, generate leads.
[01:47:07.140 --> 01:47:10.900]   America's Car Mart generated 21,000 leads using WebChat,
[01:47:10.900 --> 01:47:12.300]   right on their websites.
[01:47:12.300 --> 01:47:14.340]   Another way you can use podium.
[01:47:14.340 --> 01:47:18.100]   Before podium, they said we had to contact us for them.
[01:47:18.100 --> 01:47:20.660]   It could be days before anybody got back to that customer
[01:47:20.660 --> 01:47:22.580]   because, well, frankly, it was complicated.
[01:47:22.580 --> 01:47:24.140]   Our response time is cut down to minutes.
[01:47:24.140 --> 01:47:25.860]   This is one of the nice things about podium.
[01:47:25.860 --> 01:47:28.580]   podium WebChat lets website visitors text
[01:47:28.580 --> 01:47:30.740]   with your team right from your homepage.
[01:47:30.740 --> 01:47:33.300]   There's video chat to podium, video chat.
[01:47:33.300 --> 01:47:36.340]   You get paid fast over text with podium payments.
[01:47:36.340 --> 01:47:38.700]   And of course it all comes together with podium inbox,
[01:47:38.700 --> 01:47:42.340]   which keeps leads warm and lets you easily respond
[01:47:42.340 --> 01:47:43.980]   to feedback all in one place.
[01:47:43.980 --> 01:47:46.780]   podium's got a full team in place to answer questions,
[01:47:46.780 --> 01:47:48.420]   to walk you through everything.
[01:47:48.420 --> 01:47:50.260]   Find out how podium can help your business reach
[01:47:50.260 --> 01:47:51.820]   more customers.

[01:48:12.380 --> 01:48:17.420]   We thank them so much for their support of this week at Tech.
[01:48:17.420 --> 01:48:22.260]   We thank you for supporting us by using that address
[01:48:22.260 --> 01:48:26.780]   so they know you saw it here. podium.com/twit.
[01:48:26.780 --> 01:48:29.980]   SolarWinds back in the news.
[01:48:29.980 --> 01:48:32.860]   I thought we beat this one.
[01:48:32.860 --> 01:48:35.140]   SolarWinds hackers launching new attacks
[01:48:35.140 --> 01:48:37.380]   according to Microsoft.
[01:48:37.380 --> 01:48:40.660]   We know that SolarWinds is Russian state sponsored hackers.
[01:48:40.660 --> 01:48:43.740]   They broke into a lot of public
[01:48:43.740 --> 01:48:46.500]   and private sector organizations last year.
[01:48:46.500 --> 01:48:47.820]   Now, according to Microsoft,
[01:48:47.820 --> 01:48:49.860]   they're going after international development,
[01:48:49.860 --> 01:48:53.620]   humanitarian and human rights organizations.
[01:48:53.620 --> 01:48:58.820]   Fishing emails, they've sent out to 3,000 people
[01:48:58.820 --> 01:49:01.060]   at 150 organizations.
[01:49:01.060 --> 01:49:02.500]   They contain links, once clicked,
[01:49:02.500 --> 01:49:04.180]   that would enable hackers to steal data
[01:49:04.180 --> 01:49:07.060]   and infect other computers.
[01:49:07.060 --> 01:49:10.420]   Nobellium is at work again.
[01:49:10.420 --> 01:49:12.140]   That's the tool.
[01:49:12.140 --> 01:49:15.700]   Or actually that's the Russian state sponsored hacking group.
[01:49:15.700 --> 01:49:17.700]   But you'll notice what are they targeting?
[01:49:17.700 --> 01:49:22.740]   The human rights NGOs that would be critical of a certain country.
[01:49:22.740 --> 01:49:23.740]   Yeah.
[01:49:23.740 --> 01:49:28.740]   It's definitely a political action arm for Putin, right?
[01:49:28.740 --> 01:49:30.020]   Yeah.
[01:49:30.020 --> 01:49:31.260]   Yeah. It's kind of amazing.
[01:49:31.260 --> 01:49:33.500]   I wonder if it's related to the bello-Russian
[01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:40.020]   rerouting of that Ryan airplane from Greece.
[01:49:40.020 --> 01:49:42.420]   Yeah, but correct me if I'm wrong,
[01:49:42.420 --> 01:49:44.620]   because you probably covered this here on Twitter more.
[01:49:44.620 --> 01:49:46.980]   But the problem with the SolarWinds hack
[01:49:46.980 --> 01:49:50.060]   is they were there for a long time,
[01:49:50.060 --> 01:49:53.780]   so we don't know all the booby traps and sort of hidey holes.
[01:49:53.780 --> 01:49:58.380]   They could, they just turn this one on,
[01:49:58.380 --> 01:49:59.620]   but this could go on for years.
[01:49:59.620 --> 01:50:00.780]   Like we find out later, oh,
[01:50:00.780 --> 01:50:02.820]   they turned this little booby trap out
[01:50:02.820 --> 01:50:05.300]   or backdoor on later to do this thing, you know?
[01:50:05.300 --> 01:50:06.340]   It's really interesting,
[01:50:06.340 --> 01:50:08.660]   and this is in the Microsoft blog post,
[01:50:08.660 --> 01:50:12.940]   that these Russian sponsored state hackers really are,
[01:50:14.020 --> 01:50:17.340]   they're a political action arm of the Putin government
[01:50:17.340 --> 01:50:20.060]   at the height of the COVID pandemic.
[01:50:20.060 --> 01:50:27.060]   Strontium related sponsored hacking groups targeted health care
[01:50:27.060 --> 01:50:29.260]   organizations involved with vaccines.
[01:50:29.260 --> 01:50:33.660]   In 2019, they targeted sporting and anti-dope organizations.
[01:50:33.660 --> 01:50:35.660]   Remember, Russia was getting a lot of heat
[01:50:35.660 --> 01:50:38.540]   for, in fact, their national teams were banned
[01:50:38.540 --> 01:50:41.900]   in some events because of doping.
[01:50:43.380 --> 01:50:46.380]   They've been targeting elections in the US and elsewhere.
[01:50:46.380 --> 01:50:49.860]   Microsoft says this is an example of how cyber attacks
[01:50:49.860 --> 01:50:52.820]   have become a tool of choice for a growing number of nation states
[01:50:52.820 --> 01:50:56.380]   to accomplish a wide variety of political objectives.
[01:50:56.380 --> 01:51:02.740]   So I had, I interviewed the CISO or whatever,
[01:51:02.740 --> 01:51:04.540]   headmuckety-muck over at Cyber Reason,
[01:51:04.540 --> 01:51:07.020]   one of these, you know, about ransomware stuff.
[01:51:07.020 --> 01:51:08.740]   And the analogy that he used,
[01:51:08.740 --> 01:51:11.820]   he's like, this is the perfect, put on history hat, Dolly.
[01:51:11.820 --> 01:51:16.220]   This is the perfect analogy is to actual piracy back in the day.
[01:51:16.220 --> 01:51:20.500]   Right. Like Queen Elizabeth would allow people to go out on the boats.
[01:51:20.500 --> 01:51:23.020]   Right. And you had plausible deniability,
[01:51:23.020 --> 01:51:24.140]   but they're free booters.
[01:51:24.140 --> 01:51:27.340]   But then if you like robbed the Spanish galleon fleet,
[01:51:27.340 --> 01:51:29.300]   Queen Elizabeth wouldn't be mad at you, you know?
[01:51:29.300 --> 01:51:31.900]   Yeah, that's a really good point.
[01:51:31.900 --> 01:51:34.420]   So he's like, this is the direct analogy where,
[01:51:34.420 --> 01:51:38.140]   and he's like, you know this because basically,
[01:51:38.140 --> 01:51:42.820]   we know that the word went out that you guys can do all of this dirt
[01:51:42.820 --> 01:51:47.820]   on your own account as long as when we ask you to do a favor for us,
[01:51:47.820 --> 01:51:49.220]   that favor gets done.
[01:51:49.220 --> 01:51:51.460]   And one of the reasons that they know that is,
[01:51:51.460 --> 01:51:53.140]   and several security experts said this,
[01:51:53.140 --> 01:51:56.380]   like if you put those Cyrillic alphabet,
[01:51:56.380 --> 01:51:58.220]   if you install that on your head,
[01:51:58.220 --> 01:52:00.380]   because they were told not to...
[01:52:00.380 --> 01:52:01.820]   The Russian keyboards.
[01:52:01.820 --> 01:52:05.740]   Yeah. They were told you cannot hack anybody internally.
[01:52:05.740 --> 01:52:08.420]   So when they go out and they look for targets,
[01:52:08.420 --> 01:52:11.180]   if you have a Cyrillic alphabet loaded on your computer,
[01:52:11.180 --> 01:52:15.100]   they keep on moving because they don't want to attack anybody internally.
[01:52:15.100 --> 01:52:21.060]   This, by the way, is not necessarily a recommended mitigation for hacking,
[01:52:21.060 --> 01:52:25.820]   but the ransomware that was used against the colonial pipeline, folks.
[01:52:25.820 --> 01:52:28.060]   And another ransomware, apparently,
[01:52:28.060 --> 01:52:31.860]   looks for the installed international keyboard,
[01:52:31.860 --> 01:52:38.460]   the virtual keyboard for a variety of Russian-aligned states.
[01:52:38.460 --> 01:52:44.500]   And some think it's just a way of avoiding scrutiny by the police,
[01:52:44.500 --> 01:52:48.500]   but I think you're closer to the fact that's just like a little hint.
[01:52:48.500 --> 01:52:50.260]   You know, like, we're a good guys.
[01:52:50.260 --> 01:52:52.020]   Don't mess with us.
[01:52:52.020 --> 01:52:53.540]   Yeah.
[01:52:53.540 --> 01:52:56.100]   Brian Krebs, I think, had that story.
[01:52:56.100 --> 01:52:58.100]   The people who discovered it said,
[01:52:58.100 --> 01:53:01.380]   "Don't assume that this will work forever."
[01:53:01.380 --> 01:53:03.140]   But it couldn't hurt.
[01:53:03.140 --> 01:53:05.060]   Yeah, it's all the Russian keyboard.
[01:53:05.060 --> 01:53:06.260]   Why not?
[01:53:06.260 --> 01:53:07.220]   Why not?
[01:53:07.220 --> 01:53:10.180]   Isn't that hysterical?
[01:53:10.180 --> 01:53:10.740]   Let's see.
[01:53:10.740 --> 01:53:13.380]   I was just trying to find that.
[01:53:13.380 --> 01:53:14.660]   Yeah, here it is.
[01:53:14.660 --> 01:53:19.940]   There's a list on Krebs' own security of the keyboards that will work
[01:53:19.940 --> 01:53:23.140]   just for your own edification.
[01:53:23.140 --> 01:53:26.580]   Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Tajik.
[01:53:26.580 --> 01:53:29.540]   All your listeners are going to be installing the...
[01:53:29.540 --> 01:53:31.220]   Cut the Azerba Johnny keyboard.
[01:53:31.220 --> 01:53:32.420]   It's really nice.
[01:53:32.420 --> 01:53:35.860]   Georgian, Kazak, Kirkiis, Turkmenistan,
[01:53:35.860 --> 01:53:40.900]   Uzbek, Tartar, Romanian, Russian, Azerba Johnny, Uzbek,
[01:53:40.900 --> 01:53:43.140]   and...oh, interesting.
[01:53:43.140 --> 01:53:46.500]   Arabic, but that's because of Syria, right?
[01:53:46.500 --> 01:53:47.300]   Very interesting.
[01:53:47.300 --> 01:53:50.340]   Your dark side, ransomware, your...
[01:53:50.340 --> 01:53:51.220]   are evil.
[01:53:51.220 --> 01:53:53.700]   Ransomware will not work on those.
[01:53:53.700 --> 01:53:56.180]   It'll say, "Oh, you're cool.
[01:53:56.180 --> 01:53:58.420]   You're in with the cool kids."
[01:53:58.420 --> 01:53:59.140]   I'm sad.
[01:53:59.140 --> 01:54:02.340]   Charlie Bit My Finger is no longer on YouTube.
[01:54:02.340 --> 01:54:04.660]   But he is an NFT.
[01:54:04.660 --> 01:54:05.140]   Yes.
[01:54:05.140 --> 01:54:06.020]   Somebody bought him.
[01:54:06.020 --> 01:54:06.900]   Four.
[01:54:06.900 --> 01:54:07.940]   Get ready for this.
[01:54:07.940 --> 01:54:10.580]   $761,000.
[01:54:10.580 --> 01:54:14.100]   Honestly, good for the Charlie Bit My Finger people.
[01:54:14.100 --> 01:54:14.980]   Yeah, they got some money.
[01:54:14.980 --> 01:54:15.700]   They can have that.
[01:54:15.700 --> 01:54:16.020]   Yeah.
[01:54:16.020 --> 01:54:17.140]   Here's the...
[01:54:17.140 --> 01:54:19.300]   We could all watch Charlie Bit My Finger.
[01:54:19.300 --> 01:54:20.660]   It still exists.
[01:54:20.660 --> 01:54:21.620]   It hasn't gone away.
[01:54:21.620 --> 01:54:24.100]   Just because it's not on the original YouTube link.
[01:54:24.100 --> 01:54:25.380]   Everybody made a copy.
[01:54:25.380 --> 01:54:26.580]   Yeah.
[01:54:26.580 --> 01:54:30.260]   Is it really anything more than the greater fool theory?
[01:54:30.260 --> 01:54:34.740]   Well, I mean, I'm sure that
[01:54:34.740 --> 01:54:37.300]   collector 3F music doesn't feel that way.
[01:54:37.300 --> 01:54:40.900]   They...
[01:54:40.900 --> 01:54:41.380]   He also...
[01:54:41.380 --> 01:54:42.980]   As long as he can find a greater fool.
[01:54:42.980 --> 01:54:43.540]   Oh, yeah.
[01:54:43.540 --> 01:54:44.980]   If he could only find somebody to buy it,
[01:54:44.980 --> 01:54:47.220]   he also owns the NFTs for Disaster Girl
[01:54:47.220 --> 01:54:50.100]   and overly attached girlfriend memes.
[01:54:50.100 --> 01:54:53.140]   What's the overly attached girlfriend meme?
[01:54:53.140 --> 01:54:56.180]   How do you not just be overly attached girlfriend meme?
[01:54:56.820 --> 01:54:58.740]   That's the overly attached girlfriend meme.
[01:54:58.740 --> 01:55:01.220]   Just that image.
[01:55:01.220 --> 01:55:02.580]   But see, I can't even probably...
[01:55:02.580 --> 01:55:03.620]   No, what does it mean?
[01:55:03.620 --> 01:55:04.820]   I can't show it because...
[01:55:04.820 --> 01:55:06.100]   No, you can show it.
[01:55:06.100 --> 01:55:06.740]   They just show.
[01:55:06.740 --> 01:55:09.300]   That's like showing a photo of the Mona Lisa, you know?
[01:55:09.300 --> 01:55:10.340]   Oh, it's okay.
[01:55:10.340 --> 01:55:10.980]   They own it.
[01:55:10.980 --> 01:55:12.660]   It's just not the one in the museum.
[01:55:12.660 --> 01:55:12.980]   Yeah.
[01:55:12.980 --> 01:55:18.340]   Wow.
[01:55:18.340 --> 01:55:19.300]   So...
[01:55:19.300 --> 01:55:20.740]   The art market is wild.
[01:55:20.740 --> 01:55:22.100]   It is wild.
[01:55:22.100 --> 01:55:25.940]   And I've mixed feelings about this.
[01:55:25.940 --> 01:55:27.700]   We've talked a lot about NFTs.
[01:55:27.700 --> 01:55:29.140]   We had Trey Rachliff on.
[01:55:29.140 --> 01:55:33.060]   He's a great photographer who sold some of his own art through NFTs.
[01:55:33.060 --> 01:55:35.460]   And he points out it's no different than baseball cards.
[01:55:35.460 --> 01:55:39.700]   It's no different than the art world at large,
[01:55:39.700 --> 01:55:42.180]   which is when people paying these urban sums of money.
[01:55:42.180 --> 01:55:46.900]   Two artists for a variety of reasons.
[01:55:46.900 --> 01:55:50.260]   The only downside is obviously the environmental impact
[01:55:50.260 --> 01:55:54.420]   for some of these NFTs is quite large and that needs to be addressed.
[01:55:54.420 --> 01:55:55.220]   Right.
[01:55:55.220 --> 01:56:00.660]   Also, 100 years ago, Marcel Duchamp hung a urinal on a wall.
[01:56:00.660 --> 01:56:05.940]   And if I were investing in the NFT stuff,
[01:56:05.940 --> 01:56:11.540]   I'd go with the meme stuff because what we're sort of learning is that memes are the currency
[01:56:11.540 --> 01:56:12.260]   of right now.
[01:56:12.260 --> 01:56:16.100]   So if I had this money to throw around that I was like,
[01:56:16.100 --> 01:56:17.300]   I'll throw it at NFTs.
[01:56:17.300 --> 01:56:23.700]   This is probably the smartest investor right now buying up all these meme MFTs.
[01:56:23.700 --> 01:56:25.700]   By the way, you know, it's going to be in the moment one day.
[01:56:25.700 --> 01:56:28.820]   This is in the Tate.
[01:56:28.820 --> 01:56:30.740]   Yeah, I've seen it.
[01:56:30.740 --> 01:56:31.220]   I love it.
[01:56:31.220 --> 01:56:32.900]   I've seen that in person.
[01:56:32.900 --> 01:56:36.420]   That's art.
[01:56:36.420 --> 01:56:39.460]   Actually, the art is the name, which is Fountain.
[01:56:39.460 --> 01:56:44.340]   That's where the real art comes from.
[01:56:44.340 --> 01:56:49.940]   Actually, the one in the Tate is a replica.
[01:56:51.220 --> 01:56:56.100]   No, somebody in Gary L on the chat says, "How much for the Harlem Shake, Breaking Table
[01:56:56.100 --> 01:56:56.660]   Energy?"
[01:56:56.660 --> 01:56:56.980]   Wow.
[01:56:56.980 --> 01:57:01.540]   People have told me I should get, in fact, John, our studio.
[01:57:01.540 --> 01:57:02.980]   You should not get an NFT.
[01:57:02.980 --> 01:57:07.060]   Give me a list of like original Twitter podcasts, I could say.
[01:57:07.060 --> 01:57:08.740]   Leo, I hate to tell you this.
[01:57:08.740 --> 01:57:09.940]   It's lighting yoga ball.
[01:57:09.940 --> 01:57:10.820]   Yes.
[01:57:10.820 --> 01:57:17.140]   If you Google it, I minted the first podcast episode NFT.
[01:57:17.140 --> 01:57:18.740]   I did it two and a half months ago or whatever.
[01:57:18.740 --> 01:57:19.620]   Does it make any money?
[01:57:20.500 --> 01:57:22.740]   I sold it for, I think, 30.
[01:57:22.740 --> 01:57:24.740]   There's 10 available.
[01:57:24.740 --> 01:57:31.620]   I sold one for the equivalent of $35 and it cost me $75 in gas fees to do that.
[01:57:31.620 --> 01:57:35.540]   By the way, that's who's making money on NFTs is the people who do the minting,
[01:57:35.540 --> 01:57:37.220]   because you have to pay a fee to mint it.
[01:57:37.220 --> 01:57:42.100]   This is like selling a star or something.
[01:57:42.100 --> 01:57:45.220]   I bought some real estate on the moon once.
[01:57:45.220 --> 01:57:47.540]   Do not.
[01:57:47.540 --> 01:57:48.980]   I'm in for that.
[01:57:50.180 --> 01:57:52.980]   Actually, I have bought some of those things, stars and so forth.
[01:57:52.980 --> 01:57:56.100]   I guess that's worthless, but it makes you feel good.
[01:57:56.100 --> 01:57:56.500]   Do not.
[01:57:56.500 --> 01:58:03.540]   If you're a drug dealer, post a picture of your favorite cheese, in this case, a mature blue
[01:58:03.540 --> 01:58:07.220]   stilton with your fingers visible.
[01:58:07.220 --> 01:58:13.140]   The police use the fingerprints visible in the picture to arrest Carl Stewart.
[01:58:13.140 --> 01:58:19.300]   He posted the picture on Encro chat where he had also been selling MDMA,
[01:58:19.300 --> 01:58:24.980]   ketamine, heroin, cocaine, and posting photos of his favorite cheese.
[01:58:24.980 --> 01:58:30.660]   Well, it's important that you build a rapport with your customers.
[01:58:30.660 --> 01:58:34.900]   How the heck should they devote his fingerprints from that blurry image?
[01:58:34.900 --> 01:58:38.260]   This looks really blurry, but maybe the original is a little less blurry.
[01:58:38.260 --> 01:58:38.740]   I don't know.
[01:58:38.740 --> 01:58:42.580]   They were going to take a photo of your fingers holding mature blue stilton.
[01:58:42.580 --> 01:58:44.100]   Use a potato camera.
[01:58:44.100 --> 01:58:44.980]   There you go.
[01:58:44.980 --> 01:58:47.540]   Bad camera means safe drug dealer.
[01:58:48.180 --> 01:58:54.580]   According to the National Crime Agency, Encro chat where he posted it was used exclusively by
[01:58:54.580 --> 01:58:57.380]   criminals and cheese lovers.
[01:58:57.380 --> 01:59:03.220]   The National Crime Agency can also stand for National Cheese Agency.
[01:59:03.220 --> 01:59:09.780]   It's not the first time this has happened.
[01:59:09.780 --> 01:59:13.380]   In 2010, a guy was sentenced to prison for
[01:59:15.780 --> 01:59:17.780]   posting a photograph on his phone.
[01:59:17.780 --> 01:59:19.300]   Oh, no, they found a photograph on his phone.
[01:59:19.300 --> 01:59:22.740]   He didn't post it holding rare stolen watches and they could see the fingerprints.
[01:59:22.740 --> 01:59:23.060]   Wait a minute.
[01:59:23.060 --> 01:59:24.260]   I should hide my fingerprints.
[01:59:24.260 --> 01:59:30.180]   We've all just got to wear little caps on the fingers.
[01:59:30.180 --> 01:59:34.180]   Dog booties in the rain.
[01:59:34.180 --> 01:59:37.300]   Actually, I've been cautioned many times not to hold up my keys
[01:59:37.300 --> 01:59:42.340]   because it is apparently a trivial to take a picture of a kid.
[01:59:42.340 --> 01:59:43.300]   Don't hold it up, Leo.
[01:59:44.420 --> 01:59:46.020]   Sorry, this doesn't open anything.
[01:59:46.020 --> 01:59:47.300]   It is apparently trivial.
[01:59:47.300 --> 01:59:48.660]   Now, look at that.
[01:59:48.660 --> 01:59:53.940]   John's taken a shot from a great distance, but apparently trivial to take that picture
[01:59:53.940 --> 01:59:57.860]   and make a 3D printed object out of it that actually unlocks things.
[01:59:57.860 --> 02:00:02.020]   Well, because aren't there only a certain number of key combinations?
[02:00:02.020 --> 02:00:05.300]   That's why you can go to any hardware store and have them cut keys for you.
[02:00:05.300 --> 02:00:05.700]   Okay.
[02:00:05.700 --> 02:00:07.140]   All right.
[02:00:07.140 --> 02:00:12.820]   Are you, did you ever consider using Apple's podcast subscription
[02:00:13.940 --> 02:00:16.260]   for rather the tech meme ride home?
[02:00:16.260 --> 02:00:16.980]   Not yet.
[02:00:16.980 --> 02:00:17.460]   Not yet.
[02:00:17.460 --> 02:00:22.420]   Because I think it's horrible as currently constituted.
[02:00:22.420 --> 02:00:23.940]   Well, it's an Apple only thing.
[02:00:23.940 --> 02:00:28.740]   Apple is delaying the launch of their podcast subscriptions to June to,
[02:00:28.740 --> 02:00:32.420]   quote, "ensure the best experience for creators and listeners."
[02:00:32.420 --> 02:00:33.220]   It was funny.
[02:00:33.220 --> 02:00:36.340]   It was literally less than a week after we announced Club Twit.
[02:00:36.340 --> 02:00:38.100]   Apple announced they were going to do this.
[02:00:38.100 --> 02:00:40.820]   But after I looked at it, I was like, "I mean, clearly they're listening."
[02:00:40.820 --> 02:00:42.820]   They must have gotten the idea for me.
[02:00:42.820 --> 02:00:43.140]   Sure.
[02:00:44.020 --> 02:00:44.340]   Sure.
[02:00:44.340 --> 02:00:46.900]   I think I've said this even before on Twit.
[02:00:46.900 --> 02:00:50.660]   I am a big Apple podcast user and it is terrible as a platform.
[02:00:50.660 --> 02:00:51.940]   It's not good.
[02:00:51.940 --> 02:00:52.820]   They need to fix it.
[02:00:52.820 --> 02:00:54.180]   Well, but you still use it.
[02:00:54.180 --> 02:01:00.420]   I still use it because the barrier to transfer over all your podcasts to another app is a lot.
[02:01:00.420 --> 02:01:02.980]   And especially because a lot of the podcasts I listen to,
[02:01:02.980 --> 02:01:08.660]   I subscribe to support the podcast through Patreon.
[02:01:08.660 --> 02:01:13.060]   And then I'm given an RSS code link that I can upload through Apple Podcast.
[02:01:13.060 --> 02:01:14.740]   But I can't do it on Spotify.
[02:01:14.740 --> 02:01:18.340]   Am I going to go for a run for the app?
[02:01:18.340 --> 02:01:19.380]   Who has the talent?
[02:01:19.380 --> 02:01:20.020]   I know.
[02:01:20.020 --> 02:01:22.100]   I'm going to choose another one.
[02:01:22.100 --> 02:01:23.700]   You can export an OPML file.
[02:01:23.700 --> 02:01:24.100]   Paris.
[02:01:24.100 --> 02:01:25.140]   That's what I was going to say.
[02:01:25.140 --> 02:01:27.380]   Oh, who is the time?
[02:01:27.380 --> 02:01:33.780]   Paris and Brian and Sam, we're going to send you complimentary subscriptions to Club Twit.
[02:01:33.780 --> 02:01:36.500]   And if you want Paris, you'd have to do that.
[02:01:36.500 --> 02:01:41.700]   You either get a QR code or you upload the RSS link and then you can subscribe.
[02:01:41.700 --> 02:01:42.740]   Apple Podcast.
[02:01:42.740 --> 02:01:43.940]   And free version.
[02:01:43.940 --> 02:01:45.220]   We get that a lot.
[02:01:45.220 --> 02:01:46.500]   People say, I can't do it in Spotify.
[02:01:46.500 --> 02:01:46.900]   That's right.
[02:01:46.900 --> 02:01:49.140]   We pocketcast work with a QR code.
[02:01:49.140 --> 02:01:52.820]   But yeah, OPML is your best friend.
[02:01:52.820 --> 02:01:55.220]   We all learned about OPML when Google killed reader.
[02:01:55.220 --> 02:01:58.100]   That was the only way out.
[02:01:58.100 --> 02:02:02.100]   I feel like I've heard more about reader since Google killed it than I ever did.
[02:02:02.100 --> 02:02:03.220]   No, it's true.
[02:02:03.220 --> 02:02:07.700]   People love to talk about how Google killed reader, but no one loved reader.
[02:02:07.700 --> 02:02:13.060]   And now Google's announcing that they're putting RSS subscriptions back in Chrome.
[02:02:13.060 --> 02:02:14.900]   So go figure.
[02:02:14.900 --> 02:02:16.100]   It's not a very good system.
[02:02:16.100 --> 02:02:22.020]   It's just you can say, subscribe or follow this RSS feed and I'll show you in the new tab.
[02:02:22.020 --> 02:02:25.700]   It'll show you a card from that particular feed.
[02:02:25.700 --> 02:02:34.500]   You mentioned, and this is one of our stories, Amazon ad revenue is now twice as big as
[02:02:34.500 --> 02:02:37.140]   snap Twitter Roku and Pinterest combined.
[02:02:37.140 --> 02:02:41.940]   It is a huge ad giant growing faster than anybody else.
[02:02:41.940 --> 02:02:46.500]   And this goes back to what we're talking at the top of the show about antitrust action,
[02:02:46.500 --> 02:02:50.500]   something that the house judiciary committee zeroed in on quite a bit.
[02:02:50.500 --> 02:02:57.140]   And their report on Amazon is the practice that part of Amazon's big ad sales is
[02:02:57.140 --> 02:03:03.380]   two sellers wanting to promote their own products and get them higher up in the page
[02:03:03.380 --> 02:03:08.100]   than Amazon products, which even in a lot of cases Amazon ends up putting their own product
[02:03:08.100 --> 02:03:10.500]   next to buy button for these promoted products.
[02:03:10.500 --> 02:03:14.420]   But it is a big booming part of Amazon's business.
[02:03:14.420 --> 02:03:14.900]   Yeah.
[02:03:14.900 --> 02:03:19.860]   And if Amazon is already charging the big just to use the platform and then now there's the
[02:03:19.860 --> 02:03:25.060]   tax for the ads, then again, in theory, even if you do go back to the old, well, this is bad
[02:03:25.060 --> 02:03:27.860]   for consumers because of prices, well, that's a price.
[02:03:27.860 --> 02:03:32.260]   That's a cost that's being passed on to consumers just to make sure that you can be found.
[02:03:33.060 --> 02:03:33.380]   Right.
[02:03:33.380 --> 02:03:34.180]   The biggest platform.
[02:03:34.180 --> 02:03:34.660]   Oh, right.
[02:03:34.660 --> 02:03:36.180]   And you know who does the same thing?
[02:03:36.180 --> 02:03:37.540]   And they can't lower Apple.
[02:03:37.540 --> 02:03:38.580]   Apple, exactly.
[02:03:38.580 --> 02:03:38.900]   Yeah.
[02:03:38.900 --> 02:03:39.460]   App Store.
[02:03:39.460 --> 02:03:39.700]   Yeah.
[02:03:39.700 --> 02:03:47.700]   I feel like Apple, people are starting to, you know, I don't know who's stimulating all of this
[02:03:47.700 --> 02:03:53.300]   interest, but after Apple turned on the ability to turn off app tracking, a lot of people set up
[02:03:53.300 --> 02:03:55.300]   and said, you know, Apple's also tracking you.
[02:03:55.300 --> 02:04:00.660]   Maybe, maybe Mark Zuckerberg is secretly sending us brain waves.
[02:04:01.460 --> 02:04:05.460]   See, this is the reason why you can't get seven different colored iMacs, Leo.
[02:04:05.460 --> 02:04:06.420]   Oh, shoot.
[02:04:06.420 --> 02:04:09.060]   Tim Apple just picked up the phone.
[02:04:09.060 --> 02:04:10.260]   For Dan, I mentioned that.
[02:04:10.260 --> 02:04:11.460]   Like, Leo off.
[02:04:11.460 --> 02:04:13.380]   I don't want seven color iMacs.
[02:04:13.380 --> 02:04:13.780]   It's fine.
[02:04:13.780 --> 02:04:16.260]   He wants a special piece of color.
[02:04:16.260 --> 02:04:17.060]   You were destined.
[02:04:17.060 --> 02:04:20.660]   Hey, I think we've come to the end of this fabulous show.
[02:04:20.660 --> 02:04:22.340]   Paris, it's great to have you.
[02:04:22.340 --> 02:04:27.300]   Anything you want to plug, of course, you're right for the information which everybody should
[02:04:27.300 --> 02:04:27.540]   join.
[02:04:27.540 --> 02:04:28.100]   Oh, shoot.
[02:04:28.100 --> 02:04:29.860]   I'm really bad at this stuff.
[02:04:31.220 --> 02:04:32.660]   Yeah, keep talking of the information.
[02:04:32.660 --> 02:04:34.020]   We don't have to buy ads for you.
[02:04:34.020 --> 02:04:36.660]   And follow me on Twitter at Paris Martina.
[02:04:36.660 --> 02:04:38.740]   You can see all the tweets that I send while on this show.
[02:04:38.740 --> 02:04:40.740]   While on the show, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:04:40.740 --> 02:04:41.860]   no, only three.
[02:04:41.860 --> 02:04:42.740]   You're a bad freak.
[02:04:42.740 --> 02:04:43.940]   Only during the commercials.
[02:04:43.940 --> 02:04:46.580]   The information promo code TWIT, right?
[02:04:46.580 --> 02:04:47.700]   Yeah, promo code TWIT.
[02:04:47.700 --> 02:04:48.180]   There you go.
[02:04:48.180 --> 02:04:50.500]   That's going to really puzzle Jessica.
[02:04:50.500 --> 02:04:53.780]   I said, why are we getting all these people trying to use an offer code?
[02:04:53.780 --> 02:04:55.380]   I don't understand it.
[02:04:55.380 --> 02:05:00.820]   Can you want to explain, Paris, what your header on Twitter, what that comes from,
[02:05:00.820 --> 02:05:01.620]   doing tweets?
[02:05:01.620 --> 02:05:03.140]   What is all that?
[02:05:03.140 --> 02:05:04.020]   Oh, this is a--
[02:05:04.020 --> 02:05:09.940]   So the background image, which is a conspiracy board, lots of red string, is originally
[02:05:09.940 --> 02:05:12.500]   from sunny in Philadelphia.
[02:05:12.500 --> 02:05:13.940]   Oh, boy, yep.
[02:05:13.940 --> 02:05:16.500]   And it is the kind of conspiracy board one.
[02:05:16.500 --> 02:05:21.940]   And then superimposed over a character's face is a cartoon image of my face from my
[02:05:21.940 --> 02:05:23.860]   wired illustration when I was there.
[02:05:23.860 --> 02:05:28.260]   And in the center of all the red string in the conspiracy board is the phrase,
[02:05:28.260 --> 02:05:29.300]   doing tweets.
[02:05:29.300 --> 02:05:30.820]   That's where every conspiracy leads.
[02:05:30.820 --> 02:05:35.220]   I'm glad you explained that.
[02:05:35.220 --> 02:05:36.820]   Yeah, of course.
[02:05:36.820 --> 02:05:39.700]   Like Jesus of Paris, Martin O's, Twitter, header.
[02:05:39.700 --> 02:05:41.700]   Everybody should have to explain their Twitter header.
[02:05:41.700 --> 02:05:42.260]   It's true.
[02:05:42.260 --> 02:05:44.100]   I mean, I think it's an essential part.
[02:05:44.100 --> 02:05:45.620]   Now go ahead, it's all good.
[02:05:45.620 --> 02:05:47.300]   Thanks for being here, Paris.
[02:05:47.300 --> 02:05:53.060]   Brian McCullough, he is, of course, the lead at Tech Memes Ride Home podcast.
[02:05:53.060 --> 02:05:53.700]   I must listen.
[02:05:53.700 --> 02:05:54.340]   It's easy to find.
[02:05:54.340 --> 02:05:55.780]   Go to Techmeme.com.
[02:05:55.780 --> 02:05:59.380]   But then add it to your favorite podcast app.
[02:05:59.380 --> 02:06:02.340]   Just search Ride Home and you'll get there.
[02:06:02.340 --> 02:06:05.300]   Ride Home brings you to the place you want to be.
[02:06:05.300 --> 02:06:09.620]   Every day, not even just Monday through Friday, every day now.
[02:06:09.620 --> 02:06:11.060]   Well, no, no, no, no.
[02:06:11.060 --> 02:06:13.940]   And I'm not doing one tomorrow, so don't bug me tomorrow.
[02:06:13.940 --> 02:06:19.460]   But every weekday, let's say, with very, very common weekend bonus episodes.
[02:06:19.460 --> 02:06:21.300]   And what's your Twitter handle?
[02:06:21.300 --> 02:06:23.140]   Is it Brian MCC?
[02:06:23.140 --> 02:06:24.180]   Brian MCC.
[02:06:24.180 --> 02:06:25.700]   If you want to-- you know what?
[02:06:25.700 --> 02:06:27.060]   This show's been all about Brooklyn.
[02:06:27.060 --> 02:06:31.380]   If I have to explain my header, that is a sign.
[02:06:31.380 --> 02:06:34.980]   That's the Kentile floors sign that they tore down about three years ago.
[02:06:34.980 --> 02:06:38.020]   But every time on the F train, when you would go in towards the city,
[02:06:38.020 --> 02:06:41.620]   it goes above ground to go over the Guadas Canal.
[02:06:41.620 --> 02:06:44.020]   And you had that Kentile floors sign.
[02:06:44.020 --> 02:06:47.620]   And hopefully someone preserved it somewhere because it was great.
[02:06:47.620 --> 02:06:50.180]   What you really need is arrows pointing--
[02:06:50.180 --> 02:06:51.700]   red arrows pointing to it.
[02:06:51.700 --> 02:06:54.740]   And doing tweets on the building side.
[02:06:54.740 --> 02:06:55.380]   That would really--
[02:06:55.380 --> 02:06:56.020]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:06:56.020 --> 02:06:56.580]   That would make you--
[02:06:56.580 --> 02:06:59.060]   Just in all lights as you're going by the training.
[02:06:59.060 --> 02:07:00.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:07:00.980 --> 02:07:03.940]   Just to remind you as you're breathing in the toxic fumes, Guadas.
[02:07:03.940 --> 02:07:09.780]   Guadas really is a photogenic city, I gotta say.
[02:07:09.780 --> 02:07:10.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:07:10.660 --> 02:07:12.420]   Really, really looking good there.
[02:07:12.420 --> 02:07:14.260]   Guadas is the biggest super fun site.
[02:07:14.260 --> 02:07:14.820]   The biggest super fun site, yes.
[02:07:14.820 --> 02:07:16.020]   In the world or something like that.
[02:07:16.020 --> 02:07:16.580]   It's a really--
[02:07:16.580 --> 02:07:17.380]   Oh, it is.
[02:07:17.380 --> 02:07:18.180]   Yeah.
[02:07:18.180 --> 02:07:20.580]   You'll grow a third arm if you jump in the canal.
[02:07:20.580 --> 02:07:21.940]   Oh, God.
[02:07:21.940 --> 02:07:27.140]   And of course, my good friend and my car guy, Samable Samad,
[02:07:27.140 --> 02:07:31.380]   who's the only guy on here who doesn't have his Twitter handle.
[02:07:31.380 --> 02:07:32.260]   Or do you ever tweet?
[02:07:32.260 --> 02:07:33.460]   Are you on Twitter?
[02:07:33.460 --> 02:07:33.860]   Oh, yeah.
[02:07:33.860 --> 02:07:34.900]   I tweet all the time.
[02:07:34.900 --> 02:07:36.260]   What's my name, Samable?
[02:07:36.260 --> 02:07:37.620]   All Samad.
[02:07:37.620 --> 02:07:38.500]   Yeah, that's easy.
[02:07:38.500 --> 02:07:39.300]   Anybody can get that.
[02:07:39.300 --> 02:07:40.100]   It's easy to find.
[02:07:40.100 --> 02:07:41.220]   Easy to find.
[02:07:41.220 --> 02:07:43.940]   And I'm just going to look real quickly to see what your header is.
[02:07:43.940 --> 02:07:45.700]   It's not so complicated.
[02:07:45.700 --> 02:07:46.580]   That's Sam--
[02:07:46.580 --> 02:07:47.060]   No.
[02:07:47.060 --> 02:07:49.780]   --speed along in his classic Miata,
[02:07:49.780 --> 02:07:52.180]   which he actually owns.
[02:07:52.180 --> 02:07:53.780]   He gets to drive a new car every week.
[02:07:53.780 --> 02:07:58.420]   But when he's alone at home, he's driving his Miata.
[02:07:58.420 --> 02:07:59.140]   That's right.
[02:07:59.140 --> 02:07:59.700]   That's nice.
[02:07:59.700 --> 02:08:04.260]   Wheel bearings is the podcast at wheelbrings.media.
[02:08:04.260 --> 02:08:05.780]   Thank you, everybody, for joining us.
[02:08:05.780 --> 02:08:07.460]   We do Twitter every Sunday afternoon,
[02:08:07.460 --> 02:08:08.420]   right after the radio show.
[02:08:08.420 --> 02:08:11.060]   That's 230 Pacific, 530 Eastern,
[02:08:11.060 --> 02:08:15.220]   200, 230 UTC.
[02:08:15.220 --> 02:08:17.460]   I tell you that so you can watch the live stream
[02:08:17.460 --> 02:08:22.020]   if you choose, if you should, desire at twit.tv/live.
[02:08:22.020 --> 02:08:23.860]   There's live audio and video there.
[02:08:23.860 --> 02:08:26.100]   They're a variety of streams.
[02:08:26.100 --> 02:08:28.420]   If you're watching live, chat with us live.
[02:08:28.420 --> 02:08:29.860]   There's a couple of ways to do that.
[02:08:29.860 --> 02:08:32.340]   IRC.twit.tv is free and open.
[02:08:32.340 --> 02:08:33.940]   Lots of great people in there.
[02:08:33.940 --> 02:08:36.100]   But if you're a member of our club twit team,
[02:08:36.100 --> 02:08:39.620]   we also have a Discord whenever I'm doing a live show.
[02:08:39.620 --> 02:08:40.740]   Whenever we're doing a live show,
[02:08:40.740 --> 02:08:43.620]   we turn on a Discord stage.
[02:08:43.620 --> 02:08:45.620]   And on many of our shows, we give people a chance
[02:08:45.620 --> 02:08:48.100]   to step up onto the stage, ask questions,
[02:08:48.100 --> 02:08:49.380]   make comments, that kind of thing.
[02:08:49.380 --> 02:08:51.860]   We're doing that now every week on Windows Weekly.
[02:08:51.860 --> 02:08:54.340]   We're doing it every once in a while on Twig.
[02:08:54.340 --> 02:09:00.500]   The club twit is, there's more information at twit.tv/clubtwit.

[02:09:06.820 --> 02:09:07.860]   which is a lot of fun.
[02:09:07.860 --> 02:09:09.380]   Many of our hosts are in there.
[02:09:09.380 --> 02:09:11.140]   And you also get a special Twit Plus feed,
[02:09:11.140 --> 02:09:13.700]   which is all the good stuff we take out of the shows
[02:09:14.340 --> 02:09:16.260]   because we don't want to offend anybody.
[02:09:16.260 --> 02:09:20.340]   Twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:09:20.340 --> 02:09:23.060]   On-demand versions of the shows are not just through the club twit.

[02:09:30.980 --> 02:09:33.780]   The YouTube channel, every show we do has a YouTube channel.
[02:09:33.780 --> 02:09:37.380]   But there's also links to various podcast applications,
[02:09:37.380 --> 02:09:39.780]   so it makes it easy to add it to podcast.
[02:09:39.780 --> 02:09:42.100]   Oh, let's show that, I forgot.
[02:09:42.100 --> 02:09:43.620]   There's other free ways to interact.

[02:09:56.500 --> 02:09:59.460]   I have to say, it's a really great community surrounding
[02:09:59.460 --> 02:10:01.380]   the podcast here at Twit.
[02:10:01.380 --> 02:10:03.620]   Smart people, interesting people.
[02:10:03.620 --> 02:10:06.980]   So the more you participate with them, the more fun you will have.
[02:10:06.980 --> 02:10:09.060]   But I am very glad that you watch this show.
