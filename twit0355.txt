[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.000]   I don't know last week was such a hit with Adam Curry
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.600]   We had we had the crackpot now. We got the buzzkill John C. Devorix back that'd be me
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.240]   I get email every day
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.360]   It says I check the lineup to see if John's gonna be on and then it's funny because that that like is stock and then
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:41.080]   Half of them say and if if he isn't I didn't say yes, I'm saying I don't listen
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:47.360]   So is it I think it's better to have somebody that stimulates that kind of polarization
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.120]   Huh in the audience. Yeah, because that means Sarah Palin. They feel strongly. Did you get her on the show?
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.400]   Yeah, you know what I would get her on the show. She's got great legs
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.640]   Okay
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.120]   I did not mean that the vorak that was slash blog
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.960]   I was I was I was doing an impression of Newsweek magazine and now ladies and gentlemen from Time magazine
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:15.840]   Mr. Harry McCracken wearing his Donald Duck watch I hear it could see yeah. Yeah, that's cool. There's Donald
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.680]   There's Donald is that there's there's some reason for that the Donald Duck watches
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:26.880]   I went to Disneyland a few weeks ago and everybody gets a Mickey Mouse watch right I figured Donald needed some love Donald Donald
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:33.840]   Donald's always been my favorite too actually. He's the way now. Oh, no. That was his uncle uncle Scrooge was rolling in money
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.000]   Yes, that's that's my goal. Well, there's another one the Gladstone Gander character
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.160]   Which is the one is the lucky one the world's luck. Yes
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.800]   Wait a minute. Wait a minute. There's a character in the Donald Duck cartoons called Gladstone Gander
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.560]   So apparently you really aren't that much of a Donald Duck fan. Yes, no, even McCracken
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.280]   No, it's just kind of
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.040]   Gander wasn't in a watch. He was a
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.140]   It was a comic book thing again. It was eventually in cartoons. We started out in comic books again with the comic books
[00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:05.700]   What about Andrei on the other hand was a TV character? That's the one I know not God free Gander
[00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.080]   Gladstone Gladstone Gander wait a minute
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.120]   And the chat room of course
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.120]   Comes through immediately with a picture of Gladstone Gladstone is the world's luckiest
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:25.760]   Waterfall by the way, I am now I guarantee you I'm gonna get an email from YouTube saying we cannot show this video because you have a picture of Gladstone Gander in it
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.520]   So do it again, you know, that's not quite the Gladstone Gantam
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.680]   The better one he had a longer beak and it was that's not by Karl Barks. You know, there's a different guy
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.240]   Oh, am I in trouble here? I'm surrounded
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.640]   I was just saying how much I hated the Avengers movie and I didn't realize I was surrounded by comic book nerds
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:48.440]   I'm not a comic book nerd Dwight Silverman. Help me out Dwight Silverman's all cracking definitely is definitely McCracken
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.480]   It's well Donald. I'm a more of a Donald Duck nerd than a comics nerd
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:57.880]   Hey, it's good to see you Dwight Silverman from the Houston Chronicle. Well good to see you
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.440]   And you know, I love the Avengers movie. Did you just I thought it was big fun?
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.560]   Yeah, I thought it was better certainly than the last Iron Man movie, which was hideous
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.360]   I skipped that one. I like Iron Man one. Is it in 3d? No, no, I would not see a movie
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.040]   I don't like 3d first of all if you wear glasses, it's tough, right? And
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.360]   No, it's not dark as it is. I wear glasses and I don't have any problem whatsoever
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.080]   I'm gonna get clip-ons, which I just discovered you can buy I
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:29.560]   Really like clip-ons. Yes. Yeah, you have to buy them, but yeah, but they're like $12 in that expensive
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.560]   I did like it that Mark Ruffalo was a Bruce Banner
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.320]   I thought that was an interesting choice because he's kind of funny looking
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:40.720]   Or every time in each of the Hulk movies. It's been a different one. I like the Ed Norton
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:46.280]   Bruce Banner the well, that's because you feel like at any moment Ed Norton might actually explode in the
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.080]   Very much like on edge
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:56.120]   It's a it's a mistake for me to tell our to say to admit that I don't like the Avengers because of are we not a bunch of nerds in
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.000]   The audience who probably loved there's probably more than a few people that didn't like it either
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:07.840]   And you know and there look Ryn Brand is trying to save me. He's like well actually Leo didn't like the premise of the Avengers
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.840]   It wasn't the movie he disliked
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.000]   No, I hated the movie even yeah anyway, Hulk versus Loki
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.280]   I think I do think joss Whedon had fun with this. There's a moment when Loki and
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:22.800]   Thor are
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.680]   Talking and it's like a bit out of Shakespeare and then Robert Downey Jr. shows up in his Iron Man costume
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:33.280]   In fact says what is this Shakespeare? It was very funny and then he starts doing this fake Shakespeare thing
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:41.920]   It was it was amusing. It is the fifth highest grossing movie of all time the number one movie of the year yeah over a billion dollars
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.020]   So clearly I'm wrong no no no that's certainly
[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.920]   Right with those figures
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:57.440]   You know where the public was wrong with a Facebook IPO we got to talk about this because it's the class action lawsuits are flying
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.600]   fast and
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:04.640]   Furious is yours. I'm reviewing it. Yeah, what do you think well? I haven't seen one yet
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:09.660]   This is the Fujifilm X10. I have a X100 which I love overpriced camera right?
[00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:12.800]   No, this was 600 bucks. I have the overpriced overpriced
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:19.520]   But when I but look at this is kind of neat you turn it on by by doing that that turns it on switching zooming the lens
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.840]   It's kind of fascinating
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:25.760]   Can we start this show over
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:30.680]   Dwight Silverman is here from the Houston Chronicle and the great technology bites program
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.480]   Have you ever have you ever oh?
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.840]   We got a we got something for John
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:41.240]   Oh John this is the best hottest new camera on the market today. I saw it earlier
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:45.480]   We can't figure out how to open it though. I can get it open. Thank you. That'll keep me busy for an hour
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:52.560]   You wouldn't know how to keep John C. de Vorac and suspense so the
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:03.560]   Good luck. Oh my god. He opened it. He opened it. I can't believe it. There's a thousand dollar bill in there for you John
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:09.400]   I wish wow. I can't believe you did that but we had we had experts working on that for the last hour
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:15.760]   What kind of camera is it? It's a land a polaroid. I you should have mentioned. Oh, yeah, Lauren land camera. No, it's not
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:20.240]   It's not it's not always got there's a roll-thru right there. Well, I'm camera. Yes, it's a film camera
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:24.680]   I don't think that's a polaroid, but the original pole. No, it's not a polaroid. It's a polaroid. It's a take all film though
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.200]   This is not a polaroid. No
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:33.360]   He hasn't figured out how to extend the bellows get it. He probably had one of the originals
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:39.560]   That's how you know I have a very small camera collection and no so I I dealt with cameras like this before this and we now
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:45.040]   Know because it's written in pencil in here that this belonged originally to a something Thomas a hole
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:55.080]   Oh the patents are in here. Yeah, part of the reason we're fumpering around is because the tech news this week is just well
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.360]   Let's get on with it with it with the face all though
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:02.240]   You really do it's not dull. I was looking at that list and thought oh, this is gonna be a good alright
[00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:06.320]   All right. Well you I'll tell you what pick your favorite story Dwight. We'll kick off with a big one
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:11.880]   Oh the fate well my favorite story is necessarily the big one. It's the guy who spent
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:15.240]   Who lived in the AOL office
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:21.840]   I agree. This is a funny story. There's a great story here so far. I think it's awesome
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.520]   So he he wasn't an employee of AOL
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.320]   No, he was not an employee of AOL
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.520]   He was a guy who essentially I think was part of some kind of internship
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:38.360]   Entrepreneurial internship program and then he got a a key card and when the program was over
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:43.280]   He the key card kept working. So what he decided to do was
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:48.520]   Live at AOL while he worked on trying to develop the startup and he slept on a couch
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.300]   He ate in the free food in the cafeteria
[00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:55.680]   Brilliant and the shower in this pie people like Google right now. They're doing the same thing
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:01.240]   This is just brilliant there are people all over you know all over Silicon Valley doing this he's 19 years old
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:06.160]   So he's just a young guy and his name is Eric Simon's
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:10.320]   And he created a company called class connect
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:18.000]   Actually, it's a great idea help teachers teach more effectively. He says my expenses were about $30 a month
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:26.480]   And it's good AOL and $30 a month and he and he's clearly a rails
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:32.160]   It looks like he's using Ruby on rails. I have to say it. There's a certain look is that yeah, and that tells you where you end up right?
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.280]   homeless powered by rack space and
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:42.280]   He wound up he wound up because of the story and telling this story did he admit it? Yes
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:47.280]   He was caught eventually he was caught and he was caught by a security guard and he eventually
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:50.780]   Hey, dude. Are you have you been living here?
[00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:56.600]   So so he he eventually parlayed it into
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:02.400]   Some venture capital and he has started his company and he's allied living in a real house
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:08.920]   But he still has to go back to the AOL offices periodically for meetings because he's still involved with this group
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:15.840]   He says I make a beeline for my meeting and I make a beeline out. I don't stick around allowed to stay right
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:19.600]   You know, let's do in fact. This is gonna be upside down day on Twitter
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.600]   We're gonna do all of the stories in reverse
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:26.080]   So we're gonna start with all the good stuff that we usually say for the end of the show
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:29.280]   Oh, you mean it's not gonna be like a normal to it. We're just we start with
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.880]   This what I've got to know is this possible
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:38.400]   This guy it's actually the original story is in French
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.240]   So but this guy apparently
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:48.600]   Broke down in the desert and he had was driving a citrona so that explains it a dish of oh, which is the little small
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:55.640]   Citrona TV this sevey and he broke down and so he took it and he
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:03.240]   Tore it apart and and I think it took him two weeks later. He built a motorcycle out of the parts and and left
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:10.800]   Apparently who says there's not good tech news
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:18.640]   Apparently like the axle was busted so he couldn't get out in the dish of oh, so he
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:22.440]   Is this possible
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:27.160]   It's gotta be fake right fake. Yeah, where was he again?
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:33.660]   He was traveling through the desert Northwest Africa his dish of oh dangerous place today
[00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:40.160]   Especially in a crappy little citron this these these it's two horsepower is why they call it dish of a
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:43.480]   Originally it was yeah, it's a little better than that
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:50.080]   That's not just two horse parts and he was he was he stopped and told not to go any further due to some military conflict in the area
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:55.760]   Not wanting to listen to the advice he decides to loop around through the desert to circumvent the roadblock at which point
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:59.840]   He snaps a swing arm on his vehicle
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:07.440]   Leaving him stranded he decided the best course of action to disassemble the vehicle and build a motorcycle out of the parts
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:12.040]   It's unprepared no tools in the desert
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:17.400]   He drilled holes by bending metal and sawing at it then unbending it to be flat again in
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:21.400]   Took him 12 days. This has to be a fake
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:29.080]   Like this story it's a good creative story. Oh, he also the frame beam was broken as well as a swing arm
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:38.280]   He apparently had tools and he doesn't want to leave them because he doesn't want them. It's stolen stolen
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:47.560]   All right, there's no tech I guess I just maybe this is a mythbusters episode in the in the making
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:51.760]   He had a lot of tools apparently enough tools to do that
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:57.880]   He even put a little fender on the back. I love that keep the mud from hitting him in the head and
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:03.600]   The next story is all right. We'll move on move on. I don't want to how about
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:07.920]   Surprising new details about Mark Zuckerberg's wedding day
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:16.380]   He had green day play for him. Did they have green day? Yeah, so it's interesting because they immediately the the press agent
[00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:18.480]   releases pictures of mark and
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:25.740]   In his do bright Priscilla Chan it was a surprise wedding they invited everybody saying it was gonna be what a graduation party
[00:14:25.740 --> 00:14:30.980]   But in fact she emerges wearing a wedding gown all done for tax purposes, of course
[00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:38.340]   Made it became a 19 billionaire. Yeah, well, he still hasn't cashed out so he is no
[00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:40.340]   But he took him 1.8 or something like that right?
[00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:47.800]   Was so the mid wedding turns him into married so he can file differently so it wasn't actually thousand dollars all of green day
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:55.060]   Was it or was Billy? Here's Billy Joe Armstrong? He's singing a song. He wrote no last night on earth for the couple
[00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:57.880]   Who shared a dance in front of clapping guests?
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:05.540]   Apparently they've become friends Zuckerberg and Armstrong. Yes sure their next trip to Machu Picchu later this year
[00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:09.880]   They've been to Bob. She made a deal. So here's the deal. So if they broke up
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.320]   I got the whole story. I'm glad you're having fun with the camera. I'm getting it over
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:17.200]   There's a screwdriver on the camera, you know, you don't have to use where it's keys
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:23.760]   Here right here is a little mounted screwdriver. Oh, you busted it never just on there then there it is
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.760]   Oh, that would probably be useful
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:29.260]   Yeah, you could actually build a motorcycle with this thing if you tried
[00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:36.120]   This what I needed that's what you needed. There you go. There's this hole. So apparently mark and Priscilla
[00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:40.280]   Nobody's interested in this keep going where will this damn I'm riveted
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:45.000]   They when he moved to California she continued her studies at Harvard
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.560]   She got a biode read biology then has gone on to a med school. She's becoming she wants to be a pediatrician
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:54.600]   She'll graduate soon, but they broke up briefly while he was on the west coast. She was on the east coast
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:57.400]   He dated a somebody at Cal student or whatever
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:02.000]   But but they decided to get back together, but she made a deal with him. She said I
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.600]   require 100 minutes of your time a week and a date
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:14.200]   This is in the article idiotic that sounds it sounds like this sounds. It has to be true. Yeah, no
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:20.480]   I'm sure it's true, but it's like, you know, and I want a trip overseas once a year
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:24.200]   So they've been to China. They've been to India and they're gonna go to Peru later this year
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:27.320]   I'm pretty much done
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.480]   next
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:33.020]   If you thought the Avengers was exciting get ready for the internet defense league
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:37.920]   With the about signal they do they have an icon has cheeseburger signal
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:41.080]   Cheeseburgers code
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:46.240]   Code for what? I don't know we've tried to figure it out WordPress Reddit and cheeseburger are joining the new
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:49.320]   I think this is good the internet defense league members can sign up
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.920]   To receive code
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:57.180]   They can choose to include on their site to alert visitors about a perceived threat to internet freedom. Oh
[00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:00.240]   brother
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:07.720]   Reddit was the was the site that created this whole blackout thing remember when we all went dark for that freedom day
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:09.720]   I didn't of course you didn't
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:12.280]   Yeah, I found out about the day after
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:18.040]   We went gray we did we actually did a shows all our shows that day in black and white which I thought was kind of
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:21.680]   Yeah, that's cute. Yeah, it was a good idea. We didn't want to stop doing the shows. No, no
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:27.240]   So a Craig new mark of craigslist is involved in this public knowledge electronic frontier foundation
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:30.760]   imger
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:34.600]   Supposed to be imager imager I believe I am G you are imager
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:40.200]   The more formal launches planted two weeks when Congress returns to session
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:47.960]   The league is meant to act like an emergency broad I want to join can I join where do I sign up?
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:51.720]   An emergency broadcast is exist a more a bat signal for the internet
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:56.240]   Queuing activist sites to swoop in just as Batman would
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:59.440]   They they call it the cat signal
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.440]   Yeah
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:08.560]   Another winner, okay, those were the three stories that we would have normally put at the end of the show
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:12.040]   Yeah, they're actually better at the beginning because it just is so crappy
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:19.380]   California Senate has now passed a law that says that we could have autonomous vehicles on the road SB
[00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:22.560]   1298 let's the Department of the California Highway Patrol
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:28.760]   adopt rules and regulations to promote the safe operation of specific vehicles autonomous vehicles
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:35.120]   Soon they're legal in Nevada soon. They'll be legal in California working on a book on this are you it'd be a good book
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:40.640]   What is it? What is it? What is the premise the premise is it's a it's the most revolutionary things come out of Silicon Valley in history
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.880]   It's gonna change the world. Yeah like the segue
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:45.720]   Yeah, exactly
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:49.320]   Exactly like the segue that's right. Yeah, this is the amazing thing
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:56.320]   I don't you know the California state legislature can't agree on anything. They're the most incompetent body in the worst place in the world
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:59.360]   They're worse. They're worse than this than than Belize
[00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:02.520]   They agreed on this 37 and nothing
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:09.920]   Because they want all the owners show fur across the board douchebags across the board
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:16.160]   Here's what the Senate Senator Alex Padilla. He's a Democrat from pakoma
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:18.720]   Who will claim a pakoma?
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:26.120]   What the legislation said thousands of Californians tragically die in auto accidents each year the vast majority of these
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:32.220]   Collisions are due to human error. That's probably true, right? Sure through the use of computer sensors and other systems
[00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:37.440]   There is this problem right there a fallacious faith in computer systems
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:44.240]   Yeah, an autonomous vehicle can analyze the driving environment more quickly and accurately and can operate the vehicle more safely
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:48.280]   Are we excited
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:51.760]   How long before Texas has this Dwight?
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:58.480]   Texas should have it before California. Oh, he's dead. He's dead in the water. I knew we hadn't heard from Dwight in a while and now
[00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:02.880]   Back how's that yeah, that better. Yeah, okay?
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:08.640]   I was gonna say that I think that Texas would we would love to have one of these in Houston
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:15.440]   But the problem is with the autonomous cars is I think like everybody has to have them before they work really well
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:19.680]   No, I don't know. No, no, no, you know, I
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:23.920]   You know, I mean we have so we have so many miles of open
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:29.300]   Land and then we and then they I mean open highway and then they end in these big congested
[00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:31.160]   LA type cities here
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:35.320]   I think it would be really interesting to have one and I would love to have one in Houston traffic
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:39.920]   But I just think the problem is is if everybody doesn't have one
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:46.800]   Wouldn't it be less safe if unless I don't know I mean the Google car with a lidar and everything
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:51.680]   Yeah, it's made its way around and yeah, and it's legal legalized in Nevada now
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:55.160]   It's you had to have a person in it, but somebody has to be hovering their
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:58.520]   I think it's I think it's fine with it with the other with the
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:03.520]   Arizona Hawaii Florida and Oklahoma have all announced plans for similar legislation and
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:11.080]   Google along with the automobile Club of Southern California the California Foundation for independent living centers tech net and tech America
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:15.680]   Of all support of the California bill. So so John do you think this is actually gonna happen?
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.400]   Yeah, it's probably gonna happen sooner than we think that's the weird part
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:22.200]   It is interesting because it seems to be like this is there's
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:30.280]   Somebody I was Alan care one of these guys were talking about how it always takes 20 years for a technology to emerge and actually take hold
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:32.360]   Well, this technology is is
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:39.400]   Beyond the 20 year point. They've been talking about this since I was a kid and they were gonna put these sensors on the road
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:44.300]   That's what's changed. You no longer need to change right. That's what's changed the infrastructure doesn't have to be
[00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:46.300]   read there's been a
[00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:54.940]   A paradigm shift and how you do it and that's this is the same thing like the reason that the pad computer the I book is taken off because
[00:21:54.940 --> 00:22:00.040]   It was an old idea from in the 80s another 20 year old had what I say the I book
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:03.340]   I said the I book. Yeah, that's funny the iPad
[00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:06.620]   I do speak to Vorek
[00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:12.540]   I've been studying for years the iPad is like it is really an old idea that took one paradigm
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:19.120]   Paradigm shift a different kind of display and also that the icons wrote boom boom. Yeah, well, that's what's happening here
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:23.540]   Boom. Yeah, this idea has been around since at least the 30s when Google made its initial announcement
[00:22:23.540 --> 00:22:27.080]   I went back into popular science and popular mechanics
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:31.900]   Which you can do easily because they're both on Google books, but they've been talking about flying cars since that time -
[00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:33.900]   We're gonna get those up
[00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:37.740]   This technology leads to flying cars think about it really yeah
[00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:40.040]   Well, and also this technology
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:43.800]   they've already been taking it to GM and Chrysler and
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:47.640]   And Ford have already heard from Google about this, you know
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:51.760]   They're pitching them on trying to get this into cars and I'll tell you I agree
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:54.640]   I think it'll happen if they can get enough states to approve it
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.320]   I'll tell you right now
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:04.040]   Ford is because I went on that Ford trip to Madrid and that little focus especially the hatchback that little five-door
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:09.500]   That is an unbelievable car from a technology standpoint. You can't flip that thing
[00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:16.040]   It's got all kinds of things in it that prevent you from flipping it and they've actually gave you these cars to try to ruin them
[00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:22.160]   And these cars had all they got radar all around it's like telling me I'm gonna bump something
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:26.440]   Do you remember this at CES a year ago? I drove this the enemy from General Motors
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:30.040]   Yeah, in fact, I brought this to live with Regis and Kelly
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:33.240]   What is that actually Kelly got locked in by accident?
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:39.280]   Help me. It's kind of scary. It's a segue, but no, but this is it is a segue in effect
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:43.120]   There's just because it's a two-wheeler. It's an urban vehicle, but it's autonomous
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:45.760]   Oh in fact it can be programmed to have
[00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:48.840]   Because it only holds two people if you have a family of four
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:52.000]   They said no problem the second one will follow the first one the first one drives
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.720]   You can put the kids in the first one let the car just go. I'd rather be in a small car
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:59.680]   I drove it and it was actually pretty cool. Yeah, can you imagine getting a hit net thing?
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:05.400]   Well, you the whole point of this stuff is you don't get hit because they you know all of them are that way
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:09.760]   And so they don't run into each other. Yeah, unless there's something from a Woody Allen movie
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:16.680]   It goes back and forth on its axis because that's how it it hovers up. It's good. That's again GM
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:23.200]   It's a concept. It's not but it was a working concept. We I wrote it. It was pretty cool. They had a they were demoing it
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:28.880]   Yeah, yeah all around the country. They took one they took one to New York for me to see yes
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:30.880]   They drove all the way from Vegas
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:36.280]   Just like really they drove all they didn't they put it in a truck. Are you kidding? They're not crazy?
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:39.980]   Hey, nice job job seat of Iraq and he only did it it took him 22
[00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.600]   Wow
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:44.600]   You have to reach this is a Kodak
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:50.920]   And it looks like us from maybe the 1920s because all of the patents are from the 20s. Yeah, it's a good
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:54.960]   It's that cool. That's pretty good. We actually have about four of them over there
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.880]   so
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:02.780]   It's one more to add to the collection. Yes. Do yourself there. No, close it. Yeah, no never again
[00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:09.120]   Have you been playing Diablo 3 now? Oh, I have I can't stop you've been playing Diablo 3 no
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:11.600]   Oh, I have I can't stop we heard that twice
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:18.560]   No, but it's it's on my hair you stop to do the show my wife is a huge Diablo fan
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:21.280]   And I imagine she'll get get to it before I do well
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:24.760]   How long was it was it more than 10 years since the last one Diablo 2 and
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:32.560]   That just shows you because the pen up demand. This is the record the biggest launch three and a half million copies have been sold
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:39.240]   Add another 1.2 million players who got it for signing up for an annual pass for World of Warcraft
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:46.320]   You've got 4.7 million people on launch day all hitting the blizzard servers
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:51.920]   I'm when I got you know, I sat down. I couldn't get on for the first 12 hours finally now. It's no problem
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:59.360]   it is amazing now already 6.3 million people and those numbers don't include players in
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:06.440]   Korean internet game rooms where they buy a few copies and they're all playing and it's apparently the number one game in Korea
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:14.280]   Right now 39% of all online gaming in Korea is coming out of is Diablo and blizzard it appears as if the shutter still works
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:22.000]   Do you know what type of film it takes that's cool. I think it's like 120 or 40 or something is 120 like
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:27.760]   Full frame. I remember was it yeah, well, yeah, it's what full frames meaning listen
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:31.360]   That's the context, but it's interesting that you would ask that question. I don't know why
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:38.760]   I do not know what I'm saying. So Leo, how does Diablo 3 compare to the same place the
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:42.280]   I'm a team. There's a few more character classes
[00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:46.160]   It's if there's a few things here in there. It's pretty much the same game
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:47.920]   Isn't it funny?
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:54.160]   But it's you know, it's updated graphics and everything is I can't you know what Diablo 3 is basically a Diablo itself the whole French is
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:55.640]   It's a Skinner box
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:58.680]   you know you remember yeah be a Skinner who
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:02.440]   Would put rats in a box and train them to do things
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:08.880]   But you know to continually press a lever to get to get food that kind of thing is exactly that because what you're doing
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:14.160]   is you're clicking clicking clicking clicking clicking and and then the monster dies and then it dumps out some sort of
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:19.360]   Loop and you're it's all about collecting this loot and it's completely a Skinner box. You become a Skinner
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:24.360]   Scenerian pigeon. Yeah, it's like a pigeon. Yeah, this is the way the mouse works by the way
[00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:27.040]   The the it's an addictive mechanism
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:31.820]   That's why the Macintosh people were so crazy about it when the when people were still using DOS because you'd get addicted to this
[00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:36.600]   Clicking and then when windows came along it became even more addictive because you'd click and nothing would happen
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:39.680]   And so you'd click a lot more reverse Skinner box
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:44.440]   We know you know the pigeons you hit it and they make them click you got it. You got it. You got to get the one seed
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:49.880]   Challenge them. Yeah, so click click. Yeah, I have to say it's a it's a wonderful
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:54.520]   Wonderful a game that is it's it's clearly
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:59.680]   Pure addiction has nothing to do with there's no gameplay. There's nothing
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:04.760]   It's all about collecting the loot and you can't stop. Huh and I played for hours
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:13.640]   Are you playing on the PC or the Xbox Mac? It's not available on it's not available on the consoles. It's only PC or Mac really
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:19.440]   One of the reasons it's interesting. It's a fascinating thing that the numbers of this are so high is
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:22.040]   Because it is a PC game only
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:25.560]   Well, I'll have to put it on my Mac cuz I it runs beautifully on that
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:32.040]   I have a 24 inch iMac the one of the last of the 24 inch profit. I will it do on that you think oh it'll be fine
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:35.240]   Absolutely fine. Well, I'll talk to you guys later
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:40.520]   You know it's great because you can download it now if you have an account and you can play on any machine
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:43.840]   So you just download copies and every machine. It's the same character and I just pick it up wherever
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:49.000]   So if you have it for the PC you buy for the PC. Can you use it on your Mac as well? I?
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:55.440]   Have not tried that. I don't know I was looking at you. Yes, I would guess so it's your account your longie
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:58.960]   Yes, they're telling the chatroom Caesar not all but her trottingers law
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:05.880]   Rock law and Houdini seven and erroneous and web 37 22 and just and Dan Wally and
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:08.200]   erroneous as you yes
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:14.960]   They all say yes and now because I've read all their names. They're all saying yes, all right
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.960]   I just said yes too late
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:22.320]   Mary says I don't even know what I'm talking about and I said yes one of the things I do like about Blizzard is that
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:27.080]   They do do Mac and PC tend to do Mac and PC launches at the same time
[00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:32.120]   They do that with World of Warcraft and I do admire that I appreciate that as a Mac and there's no Xbox version
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:34.120]   No, they don't do console games
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:38.560]   Hmm
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:42.080]   It just shows you PC gaming is not dead
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:48.880]   Seriously, there's a lot of demand for it a day would McDrake is what's his name dirtbolt hurt?
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:55.560]   What's the name of the Gaddstone gander Gladstone gladstone gander you got me confused Gladstone gander
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:58.040]   He's dead
[00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:03.120]   So dish network at CES this year announced the hopper which is a new DVR
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:07.400]   Yes, it's great. It's cool. It records all the major networks at the same time
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:10.160]   Yeah, you could be like Hugh Heffner. Remember that Hugh Heffner
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:15.280]   Maybe you don't remember that Hugh Heffner had in his basement before there were DVR's before he would have VCR's on
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:20.120]   Every channel and his staff would record everything. Yeah, just in case just in case you wanted to watch
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:21.760]   Yeah, don't want to miss anything
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:27.360]   but if you're not Hugh Heffner you can get this hopper records all the major just like four or five major networks and then
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:34.240]   It has an it automatically skips ads. Yeah, no, this is a fantastic product the dish network by the way
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:38.160]   I'm a little disappointed if they go ahead and drop AMC
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:45.960]   Are they well, this is a lot of fighting there always fighting and then I had the dish for a long time
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:51.440]   And I've very very happy man channel. Yes, but this is the best thing they've come up with
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:57.880]   So I haven't got one yet. I'm very tempted but the what's kind of hard this networks are not so happy no
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:05.640]   They hate it they've worked with the dish network NBC said advertising generates the revenue that makes it possible for local broadcast stations
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:12.000]   And national broadcast networks to pay for the creation of new sports entertainment programming that is a hallmark of American broadcast
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.680]   They think it'll left that part out this simply does not have the authority to tamper with the ads from broadcast
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:22.360]   On a wholesale basis on a comment across they're still coming over the air
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:31.000]   I'm at my it's something if I'm not my doing something wrong with my dish network thing when I hit the 30 second ahead button boom boom boom
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.480]   Five times. Yes, you are John C. Devourate say that
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:40.720]   Where's it say you're that quote? Okay? What's the difference in then me getting up when the commercial starting going to the bathroom?
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:44.200]   We're going to make an assu which and then waiting for the show to start up again. What's the difference?
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:49.280]   Well NBC CBS Fox are all suing saying I don't blame him
[00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:52.400]   Fox said
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:53.800]   It was given no choice
[00:31:53.800 --> 00:32:01.160]   But to file suit against one of our largest distributors dish network because of their surprising move to market a product with a clear goal of violating
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:02.920]   copyrights and
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:10.520]   destroying the fundamental underpinnings of broadcast television ecosystem their wrong headed decision requires us to take swift action in
[00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:17.120]   Order to aggressively defend the future free over the air television replay TV did this like about 10 years ago
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:21.520]   Where are they now? I know it wasn't it didn't work out well for anybody except the networks. Yeah
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:27.800]   Well, these guys get a little more clout. It's interesting person of Tevo did that too, right?
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:34.680]   Replay TV is you can do it the way you had you there was a hidden yeah, right right?
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:36.000]   You had to unlock it in Tevo
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.840]   You still depress the button replay had one that does what the hopper does which is to simply skip them every single time
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:45.920]   So you don't need to worry about it and that and replay only had that feature very briefly
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:51.000]   And then they decided it wasn't such a hot idea after all and then they went out of business shortly thereafter
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.840]   They were sued out of business in fact
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:59.800]   No, they had other issues well they might have but they were actually I thought the replay was quite good
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:05.520]   It's a product, but they had strange as the model for selling it in distribution was pretty sketchy
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:08.920]   It wasn't as Tevo was had enough trouble
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:14.640]   I kind of understand that replay was first to be honest about it because I mean we're free ad supported media
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:17.960]   If you skipped our ads and we didn't make any money on ads or couldn't make the content
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:22.200]   We couldn't pay you the big bucks. We couldn't give you cameras to disassemble
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:24.880]   So I mean isn't isn't that legitimate?
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:32.640]   No, what the what you're doing and what TV has to go back to because they used to do this in the 50s are embedded ads
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:38.320]   So when you went and watched what's my line there would actually be Remington ran the straight crap
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:44.160]   Across the back kind of like the way NASCAR operates you wear a jacket with a bunch of logos on it
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:47.560]   And we say how you doing Leo well, I like to thank Ford for
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:52.760]   People are gonna people are gonna really resent that though, aren't they they don't bother doesn't bother them with NASCAR
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:57.120]   You ever listen to one of these drivers? He's got like 30 things on him to 30 logos
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:00.440]   And he's plugging every single one when they're talking to him
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:04.640]   You know they were very worried that go daddy would abandon NASCAR because when Danica moved
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:10.840]   Abandoned Indy car because Danica moved to NASCAR and everybody thought oh no go daddy's gonna abandon Indy car
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:16.800]   We cannot succeed without those go daddy logos and those go daddy ads. There's just one sponsor out of many
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:22.440]   But they were they were in there in here's what I fear and I think this is gonna be the unintended consequence of this is
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:27.640]   Advertisers are gonna get cageier and cageier about sneaking. Yeah, that's what's that's what you have to do
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:33.360]   You watch American Idol. It's a it's a coke ad throughout because embedded ads. That's what goes that's what goes so here's
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:38.760]   Here's the controversy. Yeah, probably placement and also saying stuff like hey Leo. You know I had a coke the other day
[00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:44.480]   It was delicious. I mean how you gonna cut that out. How are you gonna get cooked to pay me for that?
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:45.160]   That's my well
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:50.560]   I was gonna hope for the money so so this is a controversial video that is going around right now
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:56.120]   This guy says I got my girlfriend to sit in the back of our Honda CRV
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:59.720]   And then my brother came around the back
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:02.780]   I've really really really nicely
[00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:10.560]   And basically what I want to say about this song is that um and he's convinced the girlfriend to put on headphones
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:16.880]   And and he's written a song for her you and Isaac's relationship
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:20.040]   really watch this video so
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:24.960]   One and a half million people have watched this video in the last three days
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:32.480]   It's a lift up
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:39.720]   And actually it's it's pretty damn cute, but there's some concern
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:43.840]   Because right up front it mentions that it's a Honda. She's driving in
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:49.520]   Yeah, illegally I might add in most states because she's sitting in the back with it like that
[00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:55.200]   The gate open and where these two dingbats they're there it gets worse. Oh god
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:59.640]   It gets worse
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:01.000]   Now here's the question
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:06.080]   I think this legitimate in fact I've read articles and and they have a good reason to believe that this is not a Honda ad
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:09.440]   But the world many people believe that it's in fact a
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:17.400]   Crypto Honda ad no, I think it is a hundred and soon you're this is what's gonna happen is you're missing this music who's spending the money for that
[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.400]   That's interesting
[00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:21.400]   This is
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:25.800]   This had been pulled immediately just from the you're right. I mean we get our stuff
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:28.800]   This is produced there's choreography
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:35.360]   This is her family. This is her mom and dad. This is ridiculously produced. They've got a marching band
[00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:41.400]   And by the way if you didn't notice at the beginning when they got to show the Honda all the other cars in the driveway were
[00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:46.280]   Honda no they weren't there were Kia's I thought there was a hundred there was a Kia that's what tells me it's not well
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:53.080]   Not it's still this is the rest of her if they could be very sophisticated right rest of her family on Skype on laptops all singing along
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:36:58.280]   It's a Honda ad and then finally of course as you get to the end of it
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:05.040]   He gets down underneath this is her fiance the entire cast of this lift up behind him
[00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:10.360]   Which means
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:13.360]   The rest of my life trying to give you the same
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:23.040]   The money we get from making this ad now here's the question
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:27.980]   Andy and I co-said if this is in fact a car ad a very secret
[00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:32.020]   You know subtle car ad I will never buy another
[00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:38.720]   Life does he buy a hundred now I don't know but there I don't think it is I think it's real. I'm totally convinced
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:43.560]   You know why it's not a hundred why never see the damn car you don't have to he said well
[00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:48.340]   No, but look right at the front. Yeah at the front. It says on Wednesday. I
[00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:53.440]   Station my brother sit here in the back of a Honda CRV with some headphones
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:57.360]   Yeah, what there is it was at the mention the car because that is color that lets you know
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:00.440]   No, it's a small little car and she's sitting in the back
[00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:03.480]   No hook line and sink to the two of you
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:06.600]   Well, if it is a very good
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:12.680]   Million and a half views on YouTube and we're talking about it right now as an and on the tons and tons of attention
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:15.280]   It was posted on Friday here
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:17.320]   We are three days later a million and a half views
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:22.960]   It'll probably go to 30 million because of all the attention is getting and everybody mentions Honda even even this article from the Troi
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:26.480]   Free press Detroit Detroit says Honda
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:29.560]   Is it a Honda ad no yes
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:36.120]   It's not a Honda off about put in bucks. Well, how can we prove it one way or the other?
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:41.080]   They're not gonna admit to it does it make you want to buy a used on I'd like to know how they got the music license
[00:38:41.080 --> 00:38:44.680]   There's the question answer that and then he said he wrote the song for his yeah
[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:46.680]   I heard that song is is a commercial song
[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:53.380]   And why is he lip-singing it then and a lot of people say it's too well produced over produce shut off the streets
[00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:59.280]   Sure. Yeah, well, maybe it's a small town. It is a small, but everybody was the town was doing it
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:04.100]   Yeah, so I think we're gonna see a lot more ads like 10 bucks
[00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:10.040]   on a lot of secret advertising because no I think so things like this this, you know hopper
[00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:13.720]   So maybe they'll win their lawsuit the networks or when they're maybe they'll lose
[00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:19.720]   I have to say I understand their point of view. This is how they generate actually the first when the DVR's first came out
[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:21.720]   I wrote this negative
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:27.960]   Which I tend to do a negative column in the Forbes magazine saying that this was these are terrible devices
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:32.040]   Because they are they're going to ruin the advertising industry
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:36.720]   Just basically what you said and I went on and on about I wasn't totally sincere about the column
[00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:41.800]   But I did I thought the argument was valid, so I expressed it and I got some amazing negative
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:45.920]   Well, I understand I skip commercials. I understand why people want to skip commercials
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:52.280]   I'm saying because generally speaking they stink and you can't blame people for giving them the technology to do what they want to do
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:54.320]   Here's the key here's the key that was it like to bring up
[00:39:54.720 --> 00:40:01.040]   Remember when all those Apple ads were coming out with the Apple PC guy and you're skipping commercials and one of the new ones came up
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:07.120]   You'd stop and watch it right I would make the ads better exactly make the ads better
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:12.080]   There's also this technology that both Tivo and you verse have that
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:17.960]   When you hit the the fast forward button it goes to a certain point and it's moving pretty fast
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:24.040]   When you hit it it knows to go back to the start of where the to the where the show starts again in the commercial ends
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:29.160]   It kind of backs up a couple of seconds and that that actually also got the networks
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:33.320]   We're upset about that because it made it too easy to exactly skip the commercials
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:38.280]   Wes has it he says it's a Sony ad brought to you by Bruno Mars and Sony and and us and hon
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:43.680]   We're gonna take a break we have to do our ads, please don't skip it
[00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:50.520]   But I'll understand if you do this is this is my fear is that it's an issue because we are at you in bed
[00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:53.280]   You embed but we kind of we build it in you don't have it
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:56.920]   You also don't have a signal code beep that takes place as you know
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:00.360]   Some that the machines can hear and that so they can roll tape
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:05.400]   You know I'm talking about on the video, you know when they're rolling they have these codes. You don't do that
[00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:08.800]   It's hard to pull the ads out of this show. It's hot
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.840]   We make it as hard as it possibly can be less
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:13.880]   What are you supposed to do why for instance? I might start this ad and halfway through it
[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:18.320]   John will say something so compelling that you will be so sad if you missed it always a possibility
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:23.160]   Or he could do an ad for Kodak
[00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:30.920]   But first this word from go to meeting are actually I I think that the key to go doing to making ads work in this kind of
[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:35.200]   Environment where you could skip an ad is to make it something that people want to know about and if you don't want to know
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:37.360]   About skip the ad because you're not gonna be a customer anyway
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:42.760]   But go to meeting is for IT professionals if you know that it does the remote support the best in the business
[00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:45.440]   They've added something that is oh, this is go to meeting
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:48.600]   I was gonna do a go to assist ad so it starts by doing the right ad
[00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:51.120]   That's key
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:55.120]   It's from Citrix go to meeting. I've talked about this before go to John steel my yeah
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:58.600]   I know here it is I was gonna show you because go to meeting I've been meaning to do this
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:03.880]   We should have a go to meeting meeting on one of these shows they can't I'll do it next week
[00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:05.600]   I don't I have to get somebody to start a meeting
[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:11.320]   But the cool thing is you can attend to go to meeting meeting on your iPad on your iPhone on the iPad
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:16.280]   It actually uses the camera and the audio and video so now you've got online meetings
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:19.240]   You've got 49 bucks a month for as many meetings as you want as long as you want
[00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:24.080]   You've got video that's as good as any teleconferencing system this completely changes the game
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:28.560]   I mean there's people spent twenty three thousand dollars on this business Cisco conference system
[00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:32.560]   This is actually better. It actually works better. We had a go to meeting in the office the other day
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:37.200]   We had five people with iPads. I was on my desktop. I mean it's amazing. So here's the deal

[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:17.000]   See that's it. That's all I have to say I don't have to belabor the point
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:21.800]   I don't have to make a song I have to propose marriage to John C. De Vore. I've nothing like that
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:28.560]   Well if you proposed marriage you could be the I could marry you. Yes, why did you follow this?
[00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:34.640]   This is my this is my certificate in the universal life church as of 2002
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:39.440]   I was ordained and I have all the rights and privileges to perform all duties of the ministry. I
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:46.720]   Am ordained minister. I got one of those in the 70s from Kirby J. Hensley personally and it's legal
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:54.400]   We went out to his house in in Modesto the guy was a character by Kirby Hensley and he by the way was illiterate
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:44:01.920]   Yeah, you can tell he doesn't have a great a lot of people didn't realize that but then Lida Hensley who is I guess his daughter probably
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:04.800]   It's the president now and so the whole idea
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:06.440]   This is this is like a fake church
[00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:12.280]   But it's not fake because all you have to do is file some papers with the state in your church. Yeah, no, it's legal
[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:17.960]   Yeah, I've actually married a couple of people I did I did on TV. I married some of the screens every once you got me beat
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:21.560]   But I also have the doctor of divinity which is oh, I'd love it
[00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:26.120]   He asked when we were there he actually said would you like a PhD in anything?
[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:36.480]   And then meanwhile we've got Padre S. J. An actual Catholic priest who's gonna host our new
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:43.120]   Enterprise show, isn't that great? Yeah, I think it's so great. Yeah, he'll lay hands on bless your enterprise
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:46.720]   What's the enterprise speaking of the enterprise HP is gonna lay off?
[00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:49.720]   8% of its workforce
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:53.600]   Thousand employees not right away. It's gonna take about a year
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:58.880]   They expect to save three to three and a half billion dollars. This is a company. That's just again
[00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:03.520]   Just hasn't been able to figure it out and this can remains in trouble
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:11.840]   They claim they're gonna reinvest that and innovation and cool stuff though and meanwhile. Yeah, all the web OS team has gone to Google
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:19.560]   Right so the the web OS the team responsible for the web web OS development or the framework framework
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:27.200]   Went to Google most of them well, okay, so there's a guy left, but you know what's gonna happen now?
[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:32.880]   I think web OS I mean there's a teeny teeny tiny chance something will happen that will be good for it
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:35.600]   But why do you think that Google hired this now?
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:40.120]   This is the nio team and yo is is there developer framework?
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:46.200]   Why would is it so good that Google wanted to use this on a and I just wanted the brains good folks and it could be chrome
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:48.720]   It could be Android it could be something else interesting
[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:51.720]   interesting
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:56.840]   Any hope for HP John yeah, I don't know how
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:46:02.760]   Hope is always hope is always hope you if you look at their latest earnings
[00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:09.960]   Which when they announce this their software and services the stuff the kind of Leo apotheca was really pushing early on is actually doing fairly
[00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:16.720]   Well, it's the traditional part of a they should he was right. They should have gotten out of the PC business. No actually
[00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:20.880]   I actually Michael Dell who's pushing his company in the same direction
[00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:28.160]   believes that that was a huge mistake because if you're going to be selling services and servers and all this stuff the
[00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:34.840]   Come the large corporations the enterprises. They want a complete solution right they don't want to deal with two companies
[00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:39.360]   He's always done that yeah, so you sell you the HP in fact. They had minis they had micros
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:43.880]   Yeah, they have everything they have the service they have a sport they have the consultants. Yeah set you up
[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:47.600]   I remember I used to do done deal. Yeah, many years ago. I used to do
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:54.880]   industrials for them and it would be talk about how they they would do it all they had PA risk they had the whole thing
[00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:57.880]   Yeah, and you know they take care of you they take care
[00:46:57.880 --> 00:47:02.240]   They're talking about getting rid they were talking about getting rid of the personal systems group
[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:09.160]   Which is the PC desktop PC's they would still maintain their server their servers and then where's iron?
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.760]   With your IBM yeah, IBM does real well with that. Well, that's what I was gonna say the counter argument
[00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:16.760]   This is IBM doesn't make any hardware anymore
[00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:23.840]   Right HP also has this huge printer business and if you're sending printers out to best buy and office depot and everybody
[00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:30.400]   And PC's that seems to have a lot greater efficiencies of scale than just printers printers have to be hugely
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:36.240]   And they're not gonna give up printer and because of profit center although although the current the current printer group
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:39.680]   Which is different from the PSG they're eventually gonna talk about merging them
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:45.840]   But they're separate actually did not do well in this in this really either right and what's interesting is when they were
[00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:48.680]   And they were doing all this talking about splitting off HP
[00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:55.960]   the the bulk of the employees and the personal systems group are here in Houston they're out at the old compact campus and
[00:47:55.960 --> 00:48:02.840]   They were like the folks that I talked to out there were really excited about the possibility that that they would spin this off
[00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:08.720]   Because it would be give them a chance to kind of get away from the HP bureaucracy and do something more innovative
[00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:11.400]   They were excited about it and a little bit bummed I think on
[00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:19.480]   In one angle that they were not able to kind of take off with it as they wanted to they saw it as putting the compact band back together
[00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:21.480]   Oh what that's no
[00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:27.040]   But you know the chatroom saying HP is an ink company certainly the margins are huge in ink
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:31.000]   But do people print as much as they used to and is the future for printing bright
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:36.360]   I'll tell you right now people have got to get a clue and realize that those clone inks that are being made in China are
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:39.120]   Probably being made by the exact same factories
[00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:45.480]   I mean I have moved completely over and I've got some professional printers to these inks good G&G is a good example
[00:48:45.480 --> 00:48:53.760]   The inks work great. They look the same. They last as long. I think the ink businesses on shaky ground. That's interesting
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:55.760]   But now don't they
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:49:00.040]   Build chips in I know epsin did this the chips are all cloned out. I mean really
[00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:03.600]   And people you said a lot of people send their stuff back the chips are removed and recycled
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:05.600]   I mean the chip thing is
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:10.920]   Prevent you from doing that the bigger issue is over time people will print loss
[00:49:10.920 --> 00:49:14.160]   And I use my iPad 80% of the time
[00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:19.840]   I have never once needed to print from my iPad so the fact I don't have a printer well
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:24.520]   Exactly my iPad has not been a big deal. So this is the G&G ink and by the way
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:29.800]   Can I say one more thing about this ink? I'm actually suspicious that epsin
[00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:32.960]   Or one of these companies doesn't own the cloning company
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:39.160]   They're dominating the market. They have the right little chip on there and when you stick it into a like a professional printer
[00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:43.800]   It says you've got a genuine epsin Wow, and it's like and it works
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:48.040]   Huh, so the ink business is not I don't think the it's really
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:53.520]   Risky to that business. So maybe that's another issue for look at this for eight bucks
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:58.520]   I can get a ten pack of G&G. It's unbelievable Wow for the pixima. Yeah
[00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:05.720]   It's I mean this I had a cannon picks my this thing eats ink for breakfast. I mean you're like crazy. That's what I have yeah
[00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:11.440]   Great print prints well. It's a nice printer. I liked it was a Wi-Fi printer actually new get it
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:15.000]   I said it find one of your printers and get a set of this G&G ink
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:16.480]   let me just Sam is on and
[00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:21.840]   And start using it and then you'll go oh what an idiot I was to be spending 30 bucks for ink
[00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:27.960]   I know these printer companies hate me for doing this and I think they planted stories in the media saying
[00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:32.240]   Oh, you use one of these things and your printer never works again. Yeah, they do logs
[00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:37.200]   It clogs yeah, and then you go to a professional shop where the guy has to print a lot of stuff
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:42.360]   He's using it. He's doing it. They got buckets of some generic you don't do ink refills, right?
[00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:44.360]   I mean that's a mess. They're kind of scary
[00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:46.400]   so
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:51.520]   I'm looking so a a single cartridge for the epsin workforce and these are big cartridges is
[00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:56.880]   Is 47 bucks for one cartridge or a 12 pack for 33 bucks?
[00:50:57.640 --> 00:51:01.720]   There's a big difference. Yeah, that's it. That's kind of a big difference
[00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:08.680]   Actually, this is not the same time using I'm using the I've got an epsin 4,000. It's a big big
[00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:10.880]   That's a that's a roll photo printer, right? Yeah
[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:17.160]   What's a big and it prints on canvas and so I couldn't have the guy sold it to me for a song because he couldn't afford keeping
[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:22.240]   Anything in ink so I mean I literally got the thing for like three in a bus like the guy across the street
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:25.400]   There was a store before Halley's which is our breakfast place across the street
[00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:31.120]   It was an ice cream store and he and he couldn't stay in business because it was too expensive to keep the ice cream frozen
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:37.120]   You might have looked at that before you started an ice cream store that there is gonna be a cost kind of built in
[00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:39.280]   So I said well screw it
[00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:41.720]   I'm gonna you and first look and he hadn't used the thing for a year
[00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:47.720]   So it was clogged and so I went through every thing I could do to declog the I find like a $10,000 printer
[00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:50.480]   Right? I mean it's a very expensive there about four grand for grandma
[00:51:50.480 --> 00:51:55.900]   Anyway, they I got the thing completely declogged. It took I had to use every trick
[00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:59.120]   I had all kinds of crazy things out the soak it and finally
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:06.220]   What was I seriously I was at that almost and then when it got unclogged and I started using this cheap ink and set
[00:52:06.220 --> 00:52:10.320]   Of pink you have to pay a hundred and twenty bucks for a big cartridge. I'm getting it for 10
[00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:15.800]   Wow, I'm cutting my cost by one tenth and I can print what the hell you printing that big you're printing
[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:21.400]   Postures and things John leaves on a hillside. I bet she's printing things like go away
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:25.520]   So anyway, I
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:30.960]   I'm now I'm completely convinced that these inks are the same and I'm sure epsis wouldn't like hearing this at all
[00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:34.800]   I'm pretty the 12-foot sign that says don't go away angry. Just go away
[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:39.400]   Get off my lawn. Yeah, I think that's what I just what I do
[00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:46.480]   So anyway, I'm sure that epsis gng is the best or is it just that's a random gng seems to be the one that keeps showing up
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:51.480]   And and that's the one that seems to work and says it's epsin and does all the stuff
[00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:54.040]   And I'm sure epsin is gonna give me a call if they hear the show
[00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:56.960]   Yeah, there's sponsor actually, but I don't you know what I'm
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:53:02.120]   By the way your sponsor is the projectors though, right? No, no epsin
[00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:12.640]   They're very relaxed yeah, not about to think but but over time. I've been convinced now that they own this ink company
[00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:15.680]   That would be devious
[00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:21.720]   Why would that be devious in fact if I'm epsin or Canon or any any HP
[00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:26.240]   What I do is I try to sell my branded ink but I notice that customers are going to these
[00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:32.400]   Sir Chinese companies how much could it cost by the company at least I'll get something yeah, you get you and they're making money
[00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:34.320]   It's not like they're going broke these little ink companies
[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:39.000]   I mean you just make you're gouging the customer with the other stuff and epsin to their credit
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.760]   They they're they're high-end inks that they use in these big printers
[00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:46.800]   They do have some formulations that on a way you can't get clones of this now wait open crap
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:54.520]   Here's one web 99 21 in our chatroom says he due to ITC rulings. That's the international trade commission
[00:53:54.520 --> 00:54:00.320]   That's the world body that rules this stuff print con country stopped shipping out epsin compatible cartridges
[00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:05.200]   Currently GNG brand epsin compatible cartridges are not available for sale. They were sued
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:10.480]   Print country replaces the date on that. What's the date web 99 21?
[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:15.760]   It's interesting. I just got a batch. Well, this is print country. I mean maybe that's a year
[00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:17.760]   It sounds like that might not be a US
[00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:21.600]   Company I know if you can find out by just by going to
[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:24.320]   Amazon selling it Amazon selling them
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:27.480]   Print country is your premier online store
[00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:31.200]   Your happy tech store ink and more
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:40.240]   Let's see this chemical inks for less which I think Amazon's fronting for yeah, there's a bunch of other interest cartridge world which has stores
[00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:45.800]   Huh, there's but it's interesting that that companies like epsin HP
[00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:48.200]   Canada probably going to the ITC
[00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:55.240]   I'm complaining hey, this is a this is a counterfeit if you call them counterfeit, right?
[00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:57.840]   They're counter but they're not labeled. It's it's not
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:01.640]   You know if they have the chip in there now they've got them on
[00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:06.640]   There's some there's been a bunch of cases about that chip and I don't know
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:10.480]   I'm not sure this has been going on forever by the way this just debate for at least
[00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:19.520]   20 years well the ITC's added again with the Xbox as well an ITC judge says the Xbox should be banned from the US
[00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:23.040]   Due to Motorola patent violations
[00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:25.960]   Yeah, this is killing tech
[00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:33.840]   They've ruled that Microsoft's Xbox video game consoles should face a US important sales ban over four patents
[00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:41.800]   Now I don't know remember Motorola's own by Google. This is actually Google now
[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:50.360]   But suing Microsoft by proxy. Yeah, well because Microsoft is doing Google. Yeah, so this is all this is the whole game nowadays
[00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:58.120]   Wow the action this action began before the acquisition so it has a you know Google can carry it over
[00:55:58.120 --> 00:56:04.340]   But you know the the judge there's some other thing that has to happen before the expo
[00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:08.900]   There's a lot more from the shelves right so now it goes to the ITC's six member board of commissioners
[00:56:08.900 --> 00:56:13.820]   They have a deadline of August 23rd to make any changes to the ruling or throw it out if they approve it
[00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:18.180]   Then it goes to the Obama administration for a 60-day review period
[00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:24.160]   At which point Obama either signs off now see that could cost them the election right there. Oh
[00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:26.740]   Yeah, sure
[00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:33.820]   ban the Xbox and Ron Paul is in gonna be in charge I don't think anyone would complain I
[00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:38.540]   Get no one to complain about Ron Paul no one at all
[00:56:38.540 --> 00:56:42.540]   And another anti Ron Paul bigot
[00:56:42.540 --> 00:56:45.660]   Are you a Ron Paul supporter? Oh, yeah
[00:56:45.660 --> 00:56:48.860]   We'll talk about it off there. I
[00:56:48.860 --> 00:56:52.420]   Don't want to get in a political discussion here
[00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:55.780]   But I do think that this could cost an election
[00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:58.500]   Right
[00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:00.860]   These got a nice trigger on it. I like it
[00:57:00.860 --> 00:57:04.980]   You know I have it set for silence so you can sneak up at people and take pictures and they don't know see
[00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:09.300]   I don't know if you took a picture and I did all right the photos. They're very good. That's not an APS see the
[00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:13.900]   The the sensors a little smaller. It's an EXR size. We're talking about the Fujitsu
[00:57:13.900 --> 00:57:16.460]   Fujifilm Fujitsu
[00:57:16.460 --> 00:57:23.320]   The Fujifilm X10 the X10 which is their low cost only $600 version of their $1,200 X1
[00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:25.320]   And the lens is probably sold zero
[00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:30.340]   It's not interchangeable nor is the X100 but it is a zoom lens the X100 is just a fixed prime lens
[00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:34.900]   Yeah, that's not an SLR. I know no no no this isn't even a micro four-thirds
[00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:40.820]   This is just you know, it's pointing shoot basically expensive. So these cameras these cameras are endangered really
[00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:45.020]   Why I think your eyes are dead. I think mirrorless
[00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:52.620]   Interchangeable lenses are actually yeah, that's the winner. Yeah, although I gotta say I was just looking at the Nikon D3200
[00:57:52.620 --> 00:57:54.620]   Which is their new entry level?
[00:57:54.620 --> 00:57:59.660]   Camera six or seven hundred bucks and a very nice. Oh, you got DSLR
[00:58:00.500 --> 00:58:06.300]   When do you see an old? Oh, that's that's that's pretty fancy. Yeah, let's go is that the one these old is not old
[00:58:06.300 --> 00:58:09.900]   That's the top of the line. That's the top of the line. That's the professional Canon
[00:58:09.900 --> 00:58:18.980]   Right this guy's a pro photographer. This is no amateur here. He's got an L lens on here. He's shooting. This is this top of the line
[00:58:18.980 --> 00:58:23.120]   Are you your professional obviously you could be a hobby
[00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:25.540]   No, that's
[00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:27.820]   That's nice. You look good behind the glass there
[00:58:28.260 --> 00:58:30.260]   Look at that John is a camera buff
[00:58:30.260 --> 00:58:34.140]   You got a bunch of crappy photos now on your camera. I'm gonna tell you that
[00:58:34.140 --> 00:58:41.380]   Probably we're gonna take a break so John could play with the camera and then we will I promise we're gonna talk about the Facebook IPO failed
[00:58:41.380 --> 00:58:43.740]   Or not. That's the question
[00:58:43.740 --> 00:58:51.540]   What's that what's that lens is nice? It's pretty wide 1635. I have them ones F2A. Yeah. Yeah, that's nice. I like that
[00:58:51.540 --> 00:58:56.620]   Well, it cost Leo a thousand of dollars John. That's the money. I'm making on these commercials right here
[00:58:56.820 --> 00:58:59.220]   So please don't skip this Ford commercial
[00:58:59.220 --> 00:59:02.100]   Please
[00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:07.740]   Whatever you do, please don't skip this actually I'm very excited about the 20 you were talking about the 2012 focus
[00:59:07.740 --> 00:59:13.140]   You didn't see the electric though. You were in Madrid and you saw the the gas powered focus. It's got radar
[00:59:13.140 --> 00:59:17.340]   I know it's amazing what they're doing. It's the stuff parking - the bliss the bliss radar
[00:59:17.340 --> 00:59:22.300]   Which tells you in the mirror whether you've got oncoming traffic so you you know you should still look
[00:59:22.620 --> 00:59:28.220]   But it will warn you it does pre tensioning of the seat belts if you drift out of the lane and then and then yeah
[00:59:28.220 --> 00:59:30.780]   It has the self parking but a little tip on
[00:59:30.780 --> 00:59:37.500]   The some of these laughing because they know because I got in a fall. Yeah, because you rammed a thing in this
[00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:39.500]   No, you got to use the brake
[00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:45.140]   When you're done the car is still running and an idle and you don't just like sit there like an idiot
[00:59:45.140 --> 00:59:50.140]   So the car was perfectly parked and then I'm sitting and I ran into it. Sorry. There were a bunch of engineers in the back
[00:59:50.140 --> 00:59:54.740]   I think they knew it was gonna happen. You know, I didn't realize sitting in a fiesta in the back and they were laughing
[00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:59.140]   You were in a fiesta or focus. I was in a flex, which is a big giant. You love the okay
[00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:04.060]   So I do reason I got either way not a scratch in the fiesta not a scratch the reason
[01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:09.180]   I kind of got jacked up about the focus recently is because I had had taken my Lexus in for a repair
[01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:16.020]   And they gave me that little Lexus which looks like a focus that little bit bitty one whatever it's called and I drove it around
[01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:20.660]   It was okay. It was a nice car as well made, but I thought it's the focus is the $10,000 more
[01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:27.140]   I know there's your plug for it. I know I'm telling you and now they've got the electric focus is it at your
[01:00:27.140 --> 01:00:31.020]   Available now at your Ford EV certified Ford dealer
[01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:39.020]   This is in every respect. It's the best in class. It's got the most fuel efficient five passenger vehicle in America
[01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:43.820]   Most fuel efficient with 110 miles per gallon. E. That's the best city rating in its class
[01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:48.180]   That's the new thing the new EPA ratings if it's an electric or a hybrid they have E
[01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:55.340]   After it I guess it's equivalent. Yes, there's no gas. No, you know how much money you spent 110 MP Ge
[01:00:55.340 --> 01:01:01.380]   It's rated the most fuel efficient car the best city rating in its class the best in class driving range 76 miles
[01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:03.460]   and
[01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:07.140]   240 volt charge time from from empty to full three to four hours
[01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:11.820]   That's the best in fact, it's half within the sun leaf is now you do have to get that home charging station
[01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:15.020]   You don't have to it'll you could use 120 it just takes longer takes all night
[01:01:15.020 --> 01:01:20.620]   Yeah, well if it's three to four hours for 240 would it be just twice that's all night? That's eight hours do it overnight
[01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:22.860]   Yeah, I had a leaf and I had a
[01:01:22.860 --> 01:01:27.260]   Volt so you've driven all of these yeah, except this one
[01:01:27.260 --> 01:01:31.420]   You know what I love on electric vehicles is the torque the pickup and the electric engine is a happy
[01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:36.340]   They're peppy. You don't feel like you're driving a mushy car. This is a nice vehicle. Well, here's the thing it gets me
[01:01:36.340 --> 01:01:40.020]   It's actually have gotten up, but I'm not I'm involved in this commercial
[01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:45.980]   You can park at the Oakland airport now and there's a charging station at not only is there charges
[01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:51.500]   It's the best parking spots right in front. It's the number and then you know, it's always empty so go there with your new
[01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:53.220]   empty
[01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:54.660]   Yeah
[01:01:54.660 --> 01:01:56.660]   This is just a fantastic vehicle
[01:01:56.660 --> 01:01:59.620]   But you've got to go to a certified EV dealer
[01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:02.420]   There's gonna be a limited number so don't delay
[01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:08.580]   And by the way, you may be eligible for a federal tax credit for this too because this is zero emissions
[01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:12.700]   They've got the greatest and you know, they're using the latest battery technology
[01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:16.620]   I think it's seventy five hundred bucks. It says here. Oh, maybe that's not bad
[01:02:16.620 --> 01:02:24.740]   And the cell phone they have the right apps the my Ford mobile app lets you monitor the charging scheduled the charging
[01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:27.380]   on off peak hours
[01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:31.460]   You'll know exactly you can even start your car remotely. It's really cool
[01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:35.700]   The image stabilization on this camera stinks I
[01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:42.580]   Don't know nothing. I don't even know if it has image stabilization. Really not yeah
[01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:47.060]   That's kind of modern. This is an old-fashioned camera
[01:02:47.060 --> 01:02:54.860]   No, actually so conscious interior now. This is cool the the fabric on the seats is made from
[01:02:54.860 --> 01:02:59.300]   100% recycled materials. This is actually kind of cool old bags and the
[01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:05.660]   Cushions are made of a foam derived from plant seed oils. It's really neat what they're doing
[01:03:05.660 --> 01:03:10.700]   I'm just I'm kind of really proud to be associated with for they're really doing something very cool next year
[01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:18.020]   And this was one I think I might want is a 2013 plug-in hybrid and that one you use the electric unless you're going farther than the gas engine kicks in
[01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:22.220]   That's gonna be called the energy. It's the Ford Fusion energy for 2013
[01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:26.620]   Whatever you do before you buy a new car go to your four-dealer and drive one
[01:03:26.620 --> 01:03:32.020]   Check this out. You'll be very very happy you did it or visit the website. They've got a lot of information at
[01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:34.780]   Ford comm
[01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:36.980]   dash technology
[01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:39.340]   For oh, did you know that the tire?
[01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:47.980]   Actually will seal itself if it gets a flat and there's an air compressor in the car they save one of the ways they save battery
[01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:49.980]   There's no spare, but the tire can repair itself
[01:03:49.980 --> 01:03:56.140]   You could drive 120 miles at a maximum speed of 50 miles an hour left of things blown to smithereen by a shotgun shell
[01:03:56.140 --> 01:04:02.380]   That's only in Texas maybe then you could you could strap a tire to your roof
[01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:07.900]   so so Leo if you if you drive this car and
[01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:16.300]   And the all electric one you said that the gas engine does kick in after if you know no no no no
[01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:22.580]   That's the all that's the hybrid right the all electric is all electric that was one of the things people said about the voltage
[01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:24.580]   Like there's a gas engine in this right?
[01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:27.060]   There's a little weird. This is all electric
[01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:30.820]   So so what is the range on the 76 miles?
[01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:36.420]   That's pretty good city right that's but that's about a city you know if you lived in the country you go
[01:04:36.420 --> 01:04:43.740]   I can't forget it right right the main in America's that the way made it the Wayne the Ford assembly plant in Wayne, Michigan
[01:04:43.740 --> 01:04:47.780]   batteries made in Troy, Michigan. They're from compact power
[01:04:47.780 --> 01:04:53.420]   The battery pack is in the in the back under the rear passenger seat
[01:04:53.420 --> 01:05:00.580]   But you got you they've got a good cargo management system to give you more space. It's actually really cool take a look
[01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:03.220]   Ford
[01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:07.540]   Dot-com slash technology and if you want to know more about the federal
[01:05:07.540 --> 01:05:14.780]   Tax break you can go to the fuel economy dot-gov and they've got all that information and how much you can save up to
[01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:16.980]   $7,500. It's pretty cool
[01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:21.020]   And your state may offer tax break as well
[01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:26.500]   So the Facebook IPO now we're seeing the class action lawsuits
[01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:30.860]   Everybody's saying NASDAQ broke, but they didn't want to admit it
[01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:37.620]   There's this whole insider trading thing too, you know because
[01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:40.580]   apparently
[01:05:40.580 --> 01:05:46.700]   The company told some investors that their second quarter results would fall short of analyst estimates
[01:05:46.700 --> 01:05:53.700]   But they only told the underwriter analysts. They didn't tell institutional and some of the institutional investors
[01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:56.260]   They didn't tell smaller investors at all
[01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:58.260]   and this is not illegal
[01:05:58.260 --> 01:06:01.660]   selective disclosure of
[01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:09.020]   Negative information well as long as they told enough people that it could be disseminated. I think it's okay technically. Oh, maybe that's it
[01:06:09.020 --> 01:06:13.860]   Maybe they said well, you can't use like news. Let nobody's gonna tell anybody because it's that's an advantage
[01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:18.420]   You now have right you could short the stock. Yeah, but there when you tell a lot of people
[01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:23.420]   I mean it's like people who read market watch and there's a stock tip in there everybody now knows so it's built in
[01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:28.280]   They don't unless they read market watch. They don't know that minute right price now
[01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:35.180]   $31.91 off of its peak at 45 bucks on the opening day. There was no pop
[01:06:35.180 --> 01:06:43.160]   And now Facebook has weirdly enough released a camera app that looks better than Instagram
[01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:51.500]   On the iPhone. I'm very confused. They they spent a billion dollars on Instagram and this camera app is fantastic
[01:06:51.500 --> 01:06:53.180]   It's better than Instagram
[01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:59.260]   It's nicely done. I mean maybe they'll drop the Instagram deal. It's not finalized. I haven't signed off. It might not be too late, huh?
[01:06:59.260 --> 01:07:01.740]   You think that's it maybe
[01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:03.980]   these guys down
[01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:06.300]   the Instagram deal was defensive and
[01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:09.460]   And I think it was a whim on Zuckerberg's part
[01:07:09.460 --> 01:07:13.100]   This was already in the in the world must have been it was in the works
[01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:15.220]   what I wish they would do is
[01:07:15.380 --> 01:07:22.140]   Not mess with these side apps and make the iPhone app for Facebook actually usable because it's so slow
[01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:26.420]   Yes, and so awful. It's a terrible app. I might not use well
[01:07:26.420 --> 01:07:30.260]   I think what they're doing with this app is they're saying you know what maybe people don't use the Facebook app
[01:07:30.260 --> 01:07:36.580]   Maybe they just use Instagram for instance. These are pictures Shira Lazar posted from Instagram. Oh, I love that
[01:07:36.580 --> 01:07:41.580]   It's a Metro interface it slides left and right if you have multiple pictures
[01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:47.900]   You could I mean this is this is a beautiful app. This is a better app that Instagram has filters
[01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:51.020]   It has everything I don't think they're really buying Instagram to get an app though
[01:07:51.020 --> 01:07:53.540]   I think they're buying it to get that social network of
[01:07:53.540 --> 01:07:56.220]   Facebook users well
[01:07:56.220 --> 01:07:57.180]   they're
[01:07:57.180 --> 01:08:00.500]   Instagram is an app that a huge social network has been built around and
[01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:05.620]   The social network that is Instagram might be worth a billion dollars the app is not right
[01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:08.580]   And there is a basic nice photo
[01:08:08.580 --> 01:08:11.020]   there is a
[01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:17.860]   There is fortunately there's a magic wand that I could use to to add a filter that should make it beautiful
[01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:22.380]   Where's the there is this basic difference between Facebook and Instagram Facebook is for communicating with people you know
[01:08:22.380 --> 01:08:26.900]   And one of the cool things about Instagram is you can see those from people you don't know
[01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:29.580]   Right and in fact people you might not share a language with I
[01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:35.900]   Can also crop and look at this and by the way one of the things people hate about Instagram is there's always a square crop
[01:08:35.900 --> 01:08:39.340]   I can choose any crop. I want it's not getting any better is it Harry
[01:08:40.060 --> 01:08:44.620]   That is that is still a terrible picture of you. I'm sweating. That's just better than blinking
[01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:52.220]   And now I can see it in the sepia. Yeah, say something about this photo. I can add a person
[01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:56.820]   I could say you know that's Harry I put you in here more time of the public is wasted
[01:08:56.820 --> 01:09:02.100]   I don't you're not actually my Facebook friend. Are you on Facebook?
[01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:06.780]   Of course, I'm just something horrible. I said it to me. I will add you no
[01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:11.340]   I don't it's sent to everybody on Facebook. You know how Facebook works John. I don't use it. Yeah, I
[01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:17.900]   Can even I can even do location like addicted to it. They're always on Facebook addictive
[01:09:17.900 --> 01:09:23.780]   In fact, I want to be addicted to it is that people who are Facebook users tend to not only check every day
[01:09:23.780 --> 01:09:30.100]   But they spend many many hours a day on the yeah, and that between that and Diablo 3 I'm surprised you do any of these podcasts at all
[01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:36.060]   I don't let alone the tech guy. I'm actually playing Diablo 3 right now. All right. We had a lot of opinions today
[01:09:36.060 --> 01:09:39.500]   Here in Harry's adding me on Facebook right now. Is that your
[01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:43.340]   That is some other Leo report
[01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:49.420]   That's funny by the way, I notice you're using that new logic logic tech ultra thin keyboard case and I like it
[01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:53.220]   Do you like it? I do I've been playing with this and also the solar one. Oh
[01:09:53.220 --> 01:10:00.060]   Does it get enough juice to actually do anything well in theory you can use the solar one in the dark for two years
[01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:02.260]   without ever having to recharge the keyboard
[01:10:02.780 --> 01:10:06.740]   This one is kind of nicer and cooler and thinner and it uses a smart
[01:10:06.740 --> 01:10:08.340]   But it doesn't I heard about it
[01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:12.020]   I expect I to be able to fold the keyboard back like this. No, and when you do that it falls off
[01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:16.140]   Yeah, why would you want to do that so that you can use the tablet like a tablet?
[01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:19.900]   I see you if you want to go into tablet mode you sort of you have to it's not a convertible
[01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:25.100]   It's a big pocket big pockets. I think the solar one may be the one that I settle on
[01:10:25.100 --> 01:10:27.860]   So get ready really so who makes a solar one?
[01:10:27.860 --> 01:10:28.940]   That's also a large attack
[01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:34.420]   Design is kind of totally different and it's this one's ninety nine dollars available now as the solar one out
[01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:40.220]   That one's 130 and as far as I can tell they're both available. It's somewhat tough to find that's USB charging
[01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:43.740]   So it's not and it does get a long time they claim that you only have to do it every six months
[01:10:43.740 --> 01:10:50.220]   So right that's not too bad. So some Facebook rumors one that Facebook is about to buy opera
[01:10:50.220 --> 01:10:55.660]   The browser so that it can create a Facebook browser. That's an interesting idea
[01:10:55.660 --> 01:11:00.820]   I mean if you want people to live in Facebook have your own browser. Yeah, no, I've done that they haven't done this already
[01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:09.300]   Yeah, Yahoo. Yeah, who just I need to they want to take over the place. That's why they want to control
[01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:17.500]   Control the browser one reason control the browser. I'll tell you do I control the world one reason that browser knows everywhere you go and
[01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:21.860]   Could tell so does Facebook Facebook does already does to yeah, but it
[01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:29.420]   Don't have like buttons on it. So this is the same thing as the as as as a Facebook building a phone, right?
[01:11:29.420 --> 01:11:31.420]   You know people that's the other one Facebook
[01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:36.580]   That's the other one I don't see them buying that opera though because opera is so invested in its own
[01:11:36.580 --> 01:11:39.180]   web technologies and
[01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:45.220]   I mean the world is basically a web kit world especially in mobile and if you buy opera you're sort of betting against
[01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:49.180]   Webcat which does not sound like a Facebook kind of thing to do actually. Yeah, that's a good point
[01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:55.300]   Webcat is very critical at the moment, but operas, you know, you wouldn't be able to hack it
[01:11:55.300 --> 01:12:00.300]   Yeah, maybe if you provide an a more secure browser people spent more time in there
[01:12:00.300 --> 01:12:05.020]   There's Facebook buttons and Facebook controls everywhere. They get to watch everything you do
[01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:10.580]   That's the real issue with Facebook is they got to be careful because people are getting more and more paranoid about Facebook
[01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:15.500]   And the risk is that you're pushing people away by being too aggressive in in in trying to own
[01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:18.260]   Everything you do online, right?
[01:12:19.140 --> 01:12:21.180]   Yeah, oh
[01:12:21.180 --> 01:12:25.480]   You're right. It is the cookie law web 994 has a point do not track
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:33.260]   Which is now available in every browser except Chrome and is is supported by the force of law
[01:12:33.260 --> 01:12:40.780]   It means that you could set a setting in Safari or in Internet Explorer that says don't track me
[01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:46.380]   There's a Chrome extension to there's a Chrome extension, but Google has interestingly not put it into Chrome, right?
[01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:49.860]   And what that means is that the the chief
[01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:54.460]   Targeted this I think is the Facebook like button every time you go to a page of the Facebook like button
[01:12:54.460 --> 01:12:59.140]   Facebook can see what you're doing and what sites you're visiting this do not track would prohibit that
[01:12:59.140 --> 01:13:03.300]   That would be a good reason to buy opera now. Do you think they'll buy opera?
[01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:11.620]   Well, that would assume they can get people who do adopt a browser that has like 1.35 percent market share right now, right?
[01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:13.980]   Yes, tiny, but maybe you don't
[01:13:15.180 --> 01:13:21.500]   It's already a really tough browser market out there and and I don't I don't see Facebook doing that Facebook can
[01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:27.940]   Take over any browser that it that it sets itself up in and in terms of do not track you have to turn that on
[01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:28.820]   You have to say okay
[01:13:28.820 --> 01:13:35.140]   I want to do that and there's very small minority of people who actually care about most people won't do it because they would even know about it
[01:13:35.140 --> 01:13:42.860]   Right now there's a there's a question of Facebook needing something better for mobile and what they may want is the technology in
[01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:48.460]   Opera for its mobile browser, which is very fast and very speedy. Yeah, you know why it's fast
[01:13:48.460 --> 01:13:51.980]   Yes, it caches all your stuff
[01:13:51.980 --> 01:13:57.980]   It spies on you basically right so mobile might be an interesting play for a browser for Facebook
[01:13:57.980 --> 01:14:03.980]   But I don't see them wanting really a desktop browser their big problem is mobile because they're they're not doing great in it
[01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:06.940]   Well, it's a
[01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:12.220]   Facebook mean they are doing great out the problem is half of their more than half of their users are using mobile now
[01:14:12.220 --> 01:14:14.860]   Right, and you can't make any money. Yes, right?
[01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:16.860]   They're doing they don't want to do great
[01:14:16.860 --> 01:14:19.300]   Mobile until they can figure out a way to monetize
[01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:26.820]   So that's the probably one of the reasons for this smartphone rumor again Nick built into writing into the Sunday times today's New York
[01:14:26.820 --> 01:14:27.980]   Times
[01:14:27.980 --> 01:14:30.100]   brings up the rumor again
[01:14:30.100 --> 01:14:32.820]   He's not the first it's not the second it's the third phone that
[01:14:32.820 --> 01:14:38.660]   Facebook has reportedly been working on in fact they've hired more than according to Nick half a dozen
[01:14:38.940 --> 01:14:43.580]   Former Apple software and hardware engineers who worked on the iPhone and one who worked on the iPad
[01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:48.300]   This is where that stock is so important. So you can acquire some of these people
[01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:54.220]   Although I would say I'd rather have Apple stock at this point than Facebook. Maybe Apple stock has already hit the peak
[01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:57.340]   Facebook has nowhere to go but up
[01:14:57.340 --> 01:15:00.140]   The strike price is nice and low
[01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:08.020]   This would be Facebook's third effort building a smartphone according to one person was briefed on the plans and one who is recruited
[01:15:08.140 --> 01:15:10.260]   Nick doing some good reporting here
[01:15:10.260 --> 01:15:17.380]   Apparently the tech remember tech crunch in 2010 said Facebook's gonna build a phone that project
[01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:20.820]   According to Nick crumbled after the company realized the difficulties involved
[01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:27.860]   All things D reported last year that Facebook and HTC had ended a partnership code named Buffy
[01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:33.660]   Still in the works, but now this is goes beyond those attempts
[01:15:33.660 --> 01:15:37.180]   They've got a team of seasoned hardware engineers
[01:15:38.180 --> 01:15:40.900]   It sounds like the expendables or the aid team
[01:15:40.900 --> 01:15:44.980]   I don't know if mr. T is on this team who have built these devices before
[01:15:44.980 --> 01:15:47.860]   Maybe it's the Avengers
[01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:50.620]   The movie you hate
[01:15:50.620 --> 01:15:54.980]   You know, let's not bring that up again. I've already taken enough heat from my
[01:15:54.980 --> 01:15:58.900]   friends here beauty smartphone
[01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:02.740]   We would call it Thor
[01:16:02.980 --> 01:16:08.980]   One engineer formally worked at Apple and worked on the iPhone said he met with Zuck Facebook CEO who then peppered him with
[01:16:08.980 --> 01:16:11.600]   Questions about the inner workings of smartphones
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:18.940]   Zuck has become is the new Steve Jobs. I like the zuck thing. Yeah, it's like like we never had a great nickname like that
[01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:20.620]   Steve Arino
[01:16:20.620 --> 01:16:25.260]   Wasn't that it's a great Nick, you know, and but Zuck is doing the same thing Steve does
[01:16:25.260 --> 01:16:30.820]   He does one-on-one walks around Silicon Valley, you know through the woods. Yeah when he's recruiting you fantastic
[01:16:32.140 --> 01:16:35.700]   So I guess a conference room which is right out in the open at Facebook's campus
[01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:41.140]   Yeah, and theory does that for transparency to get away, but then he doesn't use it well one presumes
[01:16:41.140 --> 01:16:44.220]   He has certain meetings that aren't there because then we would all know about them, right?
[01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:51.980]   It did not sound like intellectual curiosity the engineer said Zuck asked about intricate details including the types of chips
[01:16:51.980 --> 01:16:59.220]   He used another former hardware engineer from Apple was recruited by a Facebook executive and was told about the company's hardware explorations
[01:17:00.620 --> 01:17:03.780]   Facebook when asked Friday did not neither confirmed nor denied
[01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:06.540]   Well, that's useful
[01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:10.300]   But said just like last year when we told all things D
[01:17:10.300 --> 01:17:17.140]   We're working across the entire mobile industry with operators hardware manufacturers. Oh, why do reporters?
[01:17:17.140 --> 01:17:20.780]   Use these quotes. I don't know it's a junk quote
[01:17:20.780 --> 01:17:25.100]   It's a junk quote because they won't answer the question you got a question for me one that you want a yes and no
[01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:29.220]   I think he said what's going on and then I think he said enough when they said they wouldn't confirm it or not
[01:17:29.220 --> 01:17:33.940]   He does not need to give us the junk quote. I would just they have no comment, but they didn't have a comment
[01:17:33.940 --> 01:17:38.100]   Oh, okay, we can not say they don't have a comment, but they can he can't say they neither
[01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:41.540]   Well, then how then how would they say I've got no comment is that a comment?
[01:17:41.540 --> 01:17:45.620]   That's a comment. So how can you have no comment?
[01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:51.340]   You want that in there because your editor makes you put it in there. Yeah, no, I know that the editors
[01:17:51.340 --> 01:17:54.620]   All right, did you call the company because maybe they'll spill their guts
[01:17:54.620 --> 01:17:58.180]   Which they've never done in history and no company ever has but the editor
[01:17:58.180 --> 01:18:01.100]   It's always think they're always shaking the dice hoping for the best
[01:18:01.100 --> 01:18:03.140]   But this confirms what you were saying
[01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:08.420]   I think Harry mark is worried if he doesn't create a mobile phone according to a Facebook employee in the near future
[01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:13.180]   That Facebook will simply become an app on other mobile platforms. They don't want to just be an app
[01:18:13.180 --> 01:18:15.180]   They want to own it all
[01:18:15.180 --> 01:18:20.300]   I think Dwight said that maybe I mean it was Dwight maybe it was me this confirms what I said
[01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:26.380]   I'm right again once again one way or another Facebook does sort of have to figure out what it is on mobile
[01:18:26.380 --> 01:18:28.380]   I don't I don't think they quite cracked the code there
[01:18:28.380 --> 01:18:34.100]   You know I hear that the web OS team might be available
[01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:36.940]   We could bring it back
[01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:40.700]   Okay
[01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:46.480]   Conversation just I'm just reading the article. I'm sorry was didn't you can read it out loud if you're gonna be
[01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:51.220]   I'm looking for I'm looking for something interesting. You know if you read it in your German voice, okay
[01:18:51.220 --> 01:18:53.660]   So yeah is something
[01:18:54.660 --> 01:18:58.700]   It's always interesting if you have a German accent you go finds
[01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:05.180]   former upper hardware manufacturer for the manager for the first four iPhones
[01:19:05.180 --> 01:19:08.100]   He has a new company called electric imp
[01:19:08.100 --> 01:19:17.220]   Really yeah electric electric imp let's see what let's click the link he says going into the phone there
[01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:19.220]   It is real world meaty internet
[01:19:20.620 --> 01:19:26.220]   Okay, now just wait a minute don't don't just look at this John. You're so good at grokking what something is
[01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:28.500]   What the hell is this product?
[01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:32.940]   Apparently it's a devil and a fork which means it's some sort of food company and
[01:19:32.940 --> 01:19:39.540]   Dog company so hot. Yeah, it's a hot red hot. It's actually a little hardware device
[01:19:39.540 --> 01:19:45.620]   Yeah, that you put on things and it knows what's going on. It's like oh these things have come and gone
[01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:52.100]   Sensors ever sensors. Mmm. Anyway, he's working for electric electric imp and his says
[01:19:52.100 --> 01:19:58.340]   He says I got out of the phone business because going into the phone business is incredibly complex
[01:19:58.340 --> 01:20:02.780]   Did it make that better yes a lot
[01:20:02.780 --> 01:20:08.780]   Because it's a non quote. Yes. It's incredibly complex. Does that mean they're not gonna do it?
[01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:11.300]   No, I mean anything. Why is he in the story?
[01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:14.540]   Because he says it looks like imp because Nick had his number
[01:20:14.540 --> 01:20:18.100]   He called him up. He said heights
[01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:24.380]   Hints I need to 100 more words. What's it what's going on here? I don't know
[01:20:24.380 --> 01:20:32.700]   This is a non-story basically the story is maybe they're working on another phone or maybe it's the same phone
[01:20:32.700 --> 01:20:35.740]   Or maybe it's not a phone at all
[01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:40.340]   You know the only reason I focus on this is because the next story is even more boring
[01:20:40.980 --> 01:20:44.620]   It's your ad it's no it's Google
[01:20:44.620 --> 01:20:48.620]   I'm gonna take an ad because I can't I can't bring myself to talk about the Google and Oracle
[01:20:48.620 --> 01:20:58.700]   Well, it's over now. Yeah, thank God. It's just the worst. Yeah, it's court cases are boring. You know, it's interesting audible.com
[01:20:58.700 --> 01:21:03.220]   I know I agree with you. We don't most rather do an audible ad than do this next story

[01:23:42.020 --> 01:23:48.180]   Just some great stuff on here. So Leo, do they have 50 shades of gray? They do they have all three
[01:23:48.180 --> 01:23:53.940]   That's that would be weird. That's what all the ladies are listening to now. This is basically it's a romance
[01:23:53.940 --> 01:23:59.260]   It's kind of a soft core you want to hear a little 50 shades of gray the narrator in this now
[01:23:59.260 --> 01:24:03.940]   Remember that the protagonist of 50 shades of gray is a young woman very young woman
[01:24:03.940 --> 01:24:06.340]   Who falls in love with an older guy?
[01:24:06.340 --> 01:24:09.180]   Who teaches her the ways of love?
[01:24:09.180 --> 01:24:14.100]   Okay, so they have the narrator on this is very young sounding chapter two
[01:24:14.100 --> 01:24:19.380]   My heart is pounding the elevator arise
[01:24:21.300 --> 01:24:23.700]   The elevator scene is a little steamy
[01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:32.220]   Isn't that nine and a half weeks redone it is basically I don't know what the plot it's it's not about plot
[01:24:32.220 --> 01:24:39.500]   But yes, they have 50 shades of gray the book one they have 50 shades darker book two 50 shades free book three
[01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:46.260]   And it's gets kinky as hell, but you know the word it yeah the woman really well
[01:24:47.100 --> 01:24:49.100]   It's part of my what is you listen to it?
[01:24:49.100 --> 01:24:53.540]   You know I started listening to it and then I thought you know, I'm gonna skip to the good parts
[01:24:53.540 --> 01:24:56.720]   And slowly you're a button no there isn't
[01:24:56.720 --> 01:25:01.740]   Good parts click click. Yeah, hey, there's an audible feature
[01:25:01.740 --> 01:25:04.740]   They are just give me the good parts
[01:25:04.740 --> 01:25:10.100]   It's actually actually actually you could crowdsource that you could say
[01:25:11.980 --> 01:25:16.300]   Let people indicate what the good parts are and then as you're listening to it
[01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:21.260]   It would automatically go just say take me to the most popular parts of the book. Can you do that?
[01:25:21.260 --> 01:25:23.340]   You could do that on the Kindle Kindle app does that yeah
[01:25:23.340 --> 01:25:30.420]   I actually love the fact that you can crowd have the notes of on books that others have written
[01:25:30.420 --> 01:25:35.340]   I think that's really cool and the Kindle will show you what the most popular ports portions are
[01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:41.820]   That's just a little tip there audible.com/twit to Google plus for business
[01:25:41.940 --> 01:25:48.700]   By Chris Brogan Chris Brogan's books on here. I wonder if Chris reads this how Google's social network changes everything
[01:25:48.700 --> 01:25:55.020]   Yes, he does that would be a good one Chris is great. Can you read? Let's see play a little sample
[01:25:55.020 --> 01:25:56.300]   This is a nice thing about the audible page
[01:25:56.300 --> 01:26:00.420]   You can play samples of any book you should be a bit skeptical about starting with yet another social network
[01:26:00.420 --> 01:26:03.140]   Yes, it's not like I know every person picking up this book
[01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:06.700]   But some of you just started figuring out Facebook not too long ago
[01:26:06.700 --> 01:26:09.980]   It's good. It's Chris. It's in his voice. It's great. I
[01:26:10.780 --> 01:26:12.780]   Can imagine reading one of these things
[01:26:12.780 --> 01:26:16.900]   You know I did a short story and it took forever because they kept saying you're speeding up
[01:26:16.900 --> 01:26:23.100]   You're slowing down that voice does not match the previous voice and so but there's a producer sitting across the glass for me
[01:26:23.100 --> 01:26:25.100]   Saying you know you got to do that right
[01:26:25.100 --> 01:26:31.100]   So it takes a long time the producers are all sadists. They are they want to do it out again slow it down
[01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:32.780]   But they're right no
[01:26:32.780 --> 01:26:37.260]   They're right and then you get a consistent read and that's one of the things I like about the books that audible producers
[01:26:37.260 --> 01:26:39.420]   They're frankly they have the best producers
[01:26:39.420 --> 01:26:45.500]   They have their own they have nine studios in their headquarters and they do a lot of these themselves and they do a really really really good job
[01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:51.660]   Fifty Shades of Grey is the number one book on audible fifty Shades darker is the number two book on audible
[01:26:51.660 --> 01:26:57.140]   Fifty Shades Freed is the number three book it pretty much dominates audible. Isn't that interesting?
[01:26:57.140 --> 01:27:04.980]   That's a phenomenon. I don't understand it myself. I mean it's a romance novel like any other romance novel. Well promoted. It must have been
[01:27:05.620 --> 01:27:13.700]   Must have been it's no crash would be better and book two of the King killer chronicles is out now for Patrick Rothless
[01:27:13.700 --> 01:27:20.100]   That's the one tray Radcliffe's yes. All right. Let's move on. I don't see the Shades of Dog poop
[01:27:20.100 --> 01:27:22.220]   so
[01:27:22.220 --> 01:27:27.780]   Check this out. This is good. These are good men's from Chicago. Have a friend go. This is with the box is very Bob

[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:44.480]   No, there's a bunch of them in here. I know they're really good. Oh not a bunch. There was a whole box yesterday
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:49.940]   Well, let's try one of these oh, you're gonna flip your very small and their old marshy fields gone. It's Macy's now
[01:27:49.940 --> 01:27:56.540]   Really Marshall's is gone. Yeah. Oh that's sad. Oh very sad 50 Shades of Fango
[01:27:56.540 --> 01:28:03.000]   Isn't that good? Isn't that the best mint you ever had chocolate mint you ever had? It's good. Now. I'm jealous
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000]   Ah, ah
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:09.500]   Alright, they're telling me if I do the Google Oracle story with a strong British accent
[01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:13.800]   The jury has come back and
[01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:20.660]   You remember in the first part there are two parts of this oracle is suing Google over its use of Java in
[01:28:20.660 --> 01:28:28.220]   Android right and they never gave any credit to Java. They never in fact they wrote their own Java virtual machine
[01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:34.140]   Was we davic assuming that this would get them off the hook, but but Oracle said no wait a minute
[01:28:34.140 --> 01:28:43.240]   Wait a minute. We copyright the API's we copyright the calls and the crazy. That's crazy talk and fortunately the
[01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:47.680]   Well the jury came back with a funny they said though. There was no copyright violation
[01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:55.360]   Weird it was very so oracle may go back and retry the verdict was so confused. They may retry the copyright case
[01:28:55.820 --> 01:28:58.540]   But they did lose on the patent infringement
[01:28:58.540 --> 01:29:05.020]   Case no patent infringement found the ten person jury big money started with 12 two of them left
[01:29:05.020 --> 01:29:10.780]   They were bored and they died aboard him. Yeah, it's the longest the judge said this is the longest civil case
[01:29:10.780 --> 01:29:12.780]   I have ever presided over
[01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:14.780]   Or at least it felt like it
[01:29:14.780 --> 01:29:20.540]   Google did not infringe to Java related patents that Oracle had used to sue the search giant
[01:29:20.540 --> 01:29:25.420]   That means Oracle is unlikely to get anything from the trial other than maybe a tiny amount of
[01:29:26.420 --> 01:29:28.420]   damages for one function
[01:29:28.420 --> 01:29:34.000]   Range check function. I love the judge. We talked about this. I don't know if we talked about this last week the judge William
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:38.060]   I'll subsaid hey, I've written range check functions. That's easy. I can go write them in your sleep
[01:29:38.060 --> 01:29:42.720]   I love a judge that says that that's rare. It's rare. It's unheard of yeah
[01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:49.260]   You could I could write a range I could write your range check right now. It's simple. He's right by the way
[01:29:49.260 --> 01:29:53.940]   So the idea that this somehow is patented is bizarre and absurd
[01:29:54.580 --> 01:29:56.580]   So I guess Google won
[01:29:56.580 --> 01:30:01.300]   There won't be a damages part of the trial at all
[01:30:01.300 --> 01:30:05.820]   Google said we're grateful for the jury's verdict. We are so grateful
[01:30:05.820 --> 01:30:09.060]   And
[01:30:09.060 --> 01:30:14.940]   Oracle said Oracle presented overwhelming evidence of trial that Google knew it would fragment and damage Java
[01:30:14.940 --> 01:30:20.140]   We plan to continue and defend and uphold Java's core right what's the real beef here?
[01:30:20.140 --> 01:30:23.580]   Sounds like a garage match. You know what?
[01:30:24.060 --> 01:30:26.060]   They said actually I
[01:30:26.060 --> 01:30:32.740]   Think was James Gosling the guy wrote Java, right? We were pissed as hell at Sun, but we weren't gonna sue Google
[01:30:32.740 --> 01:30:36.540]   We just said yeah, that's you know, it's just a way it is. Yeah tough cookies
[01:30:36.540 --> 01:30:44.020]   But he said I remember when the Oracle guys were doing their due diligence about buying Sun one of the things they were going
[01:30:49.860 --> 01:30:55.140]   They were really excited about it. This was the thing that they got they they were really excited. They bought Sun
[01:30:55.140 --> 01:31:00.380]   Slow-tech says it in our chat room. I think he's right. They bought Sun in great degree because because they wanted to sue Google
[01:31:00.380 --> 01:31:02.380]   Why did they want to sue Google?
[01:31:02.380 --> 01:31:04.660]   We have a grudge. They've got money
[01:31:04.660 --> 01:31:09.380]   The judge
[01:31:09.380 --> 01:31:16.660]   That would be that would be there could be some money you could pay it could pay for Sun
[01:31:16.660 --> 01:31:18.620]   Yeah
[01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:24.880]   So the judge still is not yet ruled on this issue of API's being copyrighted in the first place whether that's even possible
[01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:27.260]   But that'd be like two hundred thousand dollars max
[01:31:27.260 --> 01:31:34.420]   It won't be a lot of money and let's hope he does not rule that API's are copyrightable because that would be a horrible precedent to set
[01:31:34.420 --> 01:31:36.620]   I have some faith this guy knows what he's doing
[01:31:36.620 --> 01:31:43.020]   Yeah, it sounds like it. Yeah, he knows how to write a range check and Java damn it. I can't do it
[01:31:43.020 --> 01:31:48.500]   Oh, it's easy John. I don't a monkey could do it. Well, I don't know how to I don't never look
[01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:52.900]   Do it maybe a monkey could then why would I want to wait my dad counter?
[01:31:52.900 --> 01:31:55.620]   Do we trust them stat counters is chrome? We don't
[01:31:55.620 --> 01:31:58.780]   What is that counter is not that bad?
[01:31:58.780 --> 01:32:01.840]   They're okay, but almost everybody reported in the story which is about
[01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:07.300]   Chrome becoming the most popular browser in the world. Yeah, that's the story wrong. It's bogus
[01:32:07.300 --> 01:32:11.860]   What happened was it's that come among people who go to sites that have stat counter on them
[01:32:11.860 --> 01:32:14.660]   That little thing you put on there that like says
[01:32:17.300 --> 01:32:22.260]   Whether or not that reflects the web at large nobody knows and there there are five or six other major
[01:32:22.260 --> 01:32:26.740]   Companies attract the stuff and some of them don't even say that Chrome is the number two browser
[01:32:26.740 --> 01:32:31.940]   Yeah, some say that Firefox ahead so I find it hard to believe the only conclusion you can draw is that nobody really knows
[01:32:31.940 --> 01:32:38.020]   But I do have having nothing but but trouble with Firefox crashes all the time. It's not better
[01:32:38.020 --> 01:32:45.020]   It didn't wasn't it supposed to get better. It's gotten worse for me and used in the newest one. Mm-hmm. Supposedly its memory management is a lot better
[01:32:45.020 --> 01:32:51.980]   I'm just good. There's totally blows up every new version of Firefox for like the last three or four years in theory the memory problems have been solved
[01:32:51.980 --> 01:32:56.380]   Yeah in theory that's never solved theory. So let me see browser
[01:32:56.380 --> 01:32:59.860]   I think I lost what key some key coders or something. There's so many thing I can think of
[01:32:59.860 --> 01:33:02.700]   Where were the one thing about the stat counter numbers?
[01:33:02.700 --> 01:33:06.860]   Even if you don't think that stat stat counter numbers are correct
[01:33:06.860 --> 01:33:11.980]   They match what has been shown in terms of trends from other sources and that is that
[01:33:12.620 --> 01:33:17.420]   Firefox is either in decline or flat IE is in dramatic decline and
[01:33:17.420 --> 01:33:20.060]   Chrome has
[01:33:20.060 --> 01:33:23.740]   Solid growth and even if the stat counter numbers aren't there now
[01:33:23.740 --> 01:33:31.420]   That's probably what we're going to be seeing in the near future. I think I just really clearly globally globally right in the US
[01:33:31.420 --> 01:33:37.360]   IE is still dominant largely because of the way corporations use the might use Microsoft software
[01:33:37.380 --> 01:33:42.580]   Well, I gotta say Twitter would be is no example because of course people who listen to this show are more sophisticated
[01:33:42.580 --> 01:33:49.160]   But on our Twitter website Chrome is number one by a large margin 36% to number two is Safari
[01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:52.880]   26, oh you got a lot of Mac listeners. Oh, it's not it's iOS
[01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:57.280]   I far right I was sure and then Firefox third editor to explore only 10%
[01:33:57.280 --> 01:34:04.540]   Android 4% on the web savvy web Chrome is the most popular browser easily. Yeah, yeah
[01:34:04.540 --> 01:34:08.980]   But that's so we're also a small percentage of the world right right so on cron.com
[01:34:08.980 --> 01:34:13.300]   Which is you know the Houston Chronicles website and age very much a general interest site?
[01:34:13.300 --> 01:34:15.860]   The numbers kind of track
[01:34:15.860 --> 01:34:20.860]   About what you'd expect with a little bit more than 50% being internet explorer Wow
[01:34:20.860 --> 01:34:23.860]   They would look just at my blog
[01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:26.460]   It's it's Chrome
[01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:33.340]   So, you know, that's really interesting. Yeah, yeah, just on my blog. It's Chrome. It's a text it's soon
[01:34:33.460 --> 01:34:39.420]   So Chrome is like Chrome Chrome is where's everyone's headed be and I think it's only because Firefox is having issues
[01:34:39.420 --> 01:34:46.420]   I think they lost somebody I think Firefox lost the battle is what happened Chrome was faster easier to use that flash built in
[01:34:46.420 --> 01:34:52.860]   It's more secure. I think they just lost that they lost that's what happened and in the old days before there was a Chrome Google
[01:34:52.860 --> 01:35:00.100]   Worked really hard to promote Firefox. It sometimes is on the home page, right? And that's right. Yeah, and they're still business partners
[01:35:00.100 --> 01:35:05.540]   But Google is no longer trying to get people to switch to Firefox. Well now they don't want to pay them the royalties either
[01:35:05.540 --> 01:35:12.420]   It's a win for Google. Here was a shocker. This is a published before you go into that. Yeah, what is that phone?
[01:35:12.420 --> 01:35:18.740]   You've got there as an iPhone is that your phone? Yeah, really why I said you always were that were the note
[01:35:18.740 --> 01:35:23.580]   I have the note and the iPhone and you know, I you carry two phones not today. I have just the iPhone
[01:35:23.580 --> 01:35:25.780]   Uh-huh, you know, you know what happened
[01:35:25.780 --> 01:35:30.740]   I went to Norway and I use the iPhone in Norway because I could add, you know, buy the extra data and
[01:35:30.740 --> 01:35:32.260]   I knew what house
[01:35:32.260 --> 01:35:36.860]   Why did you just swap the sim out like most people do and put their local sim in too much trouble?
[01:35:36.860 --> 01:35:38.300]   I just thought you know, I got the iPhone
[01:35:38.300 --> 01:35:42.620]   I'm gonna that's my international phone and then I got back and I had to keep using it
[01:35:42.620 --> 01:35:44.820]   You know what really happened is a Google voice stopped
[01:35:44.820 --> 01:35:48.900]   I used to use one phone number Google voice would ring all my phones and for some reason
[01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:54.820]   It works for everybody except my my immediate family none of them can reach me
[01:35:54.820 --> 01:35:56.820]   It goes directly to voicemail
[01:35:56.820 --> 01:36:01.740]   And so I had to give them a number to call me and that's this number because I was in Norway and now I'm stuck with it
[01:36:01.740 --> 01:36:07.220]   That's the truth. You want to know the truth. That's the truth. It ends up being it's it's a phone thing
[01:36:07.220 --> 01:36:10.260]   Huh has nothing to do with apps has nothing to do with form factor
[01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:16.260]   I love the galaxy note, but I am gonna replace the galaxy note as soon as my galaxy s3 comes you like that better
[01:36:16.260 --> 01:36:23.020]   I think I will we'll see what do you has anybody played with the s3 yet? Not not yet comes out end of the month internationally
[01:36:23.020 --> 01:36:25.740]   And we look it looks like June 20th and 80 a t2
[01:36:25.740 --> 01:36:31.260]   I was just wondering because you made such a big fuss love the note about the note somebody changed it to Russian
[01:36:31.260 --> 01:36:33.260]   And I can't use it anymore
[01:36:33.260 --> 01:36:37.900]   No, what do you think of the HTC one phone? Oh, it's the best phone out there the X one
[01:36:37.900 --> 01:36:41.260]   Yeah, yeah, I have the sprint
[01:36:41.260 --> 01:36:43.420]   the
[01:36:43.420 --> 01:36:49.100]   See if I I can don't have it here with me, but I the evil 4g touch. Yeah, that's a galaxy s2
[01:36:49.100 --> 01:36:51.340]   Yeah, that's a galaxy s2. I like that a lot
[01:36:52.140 --> 01:36:54.980]   But I think the one is much dup. It looks terrible
[01:36:54.980 --> 01:36:59.160]   Well, they all do eventually no not my
[01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:03.220]   one the one the one is the best phone right now, but
[01:37:03.220 --> 01:37:09.700]   The people I've talked to have touched a galaxy s3 or very you know, it's quad core
[01:37:09.700 --> 01:37:12.700]   Which is stupid in a phone, but what the hell right?
[01:37:12.700 --> 01:37:17.820]   It's got a nice screen for it's what's for almost five inches, right? It's big screen
[01:37:19.260 --> 01:37:24.300]   I see s3. Yeah, it's at 4.8 4.8. So close to five I
[01:37:24.300 --> 01:37:32.140]   Didn't I used to not like the the overlays like a sense and touch with that's a nice thing touch with
[01:37:32.140 --> 01:37:36.140]   Since it's really nice. I really like that for on that phone
[01:37:36.140 --> 01:37:42.100]   This is this is an LTE phone sprint hasn't turned on its LTE network Houston's supposed to be one of the first ones
[01:37:42.100 --> 01:37:45.820]   First cities that gets it so I keep you know checking it. Oh, is it on yet?
[01:37:45.820 --> 01:37:51.340]   It's it on yet, right? But it's but I really like these phones and if I was to switch to an Android phone
[01:37:51.340 --> 01:37:53.740]   I would look at one of these I like these yeah
[01:37:53.740 --> 01:38:00.980]   Well, I wish is that the one s was available with LTE. That's the one on T mobile. That is a nice phone and the camera is really good on that one
[01:38:00.980 --> 01:38:06.940]   Apparently the camera very good on the s3 to 8 megapixels. We'll see you know apples apples not dead yet
[01:38:06.940 --> 01:38:12.660]   They got a new phone coming out. We probably figure in what September before Christmas for the iPhone 5
[01:38:12.660 --> 01:38:15.420]   I think it's gonna be something to watch something to look for
[01:38:15.740 --> 01:38:17.420]   We shall see
[01:38:17.420 --> 01:38:20.340]   Google says well hold but before you go on yes
[01:38:20.340 --> 01:38:23.660]   Why did you get a white one?
[01:38:23.660 --> 01:38:28.140]   Because I'm a girl. What do you I don't know because I like it. It looks good. Don't you like it?
[01:38:28.140 --> 01:38:33.140]   Yes, it's it's kind of a tuxedo. It's like black and white show so much like you really
[01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:36.400]   Emphasizes the white space shows you how small the screen is
[01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:39.460]   You know what you do realize and did you like yeah?
[01:38:39.460 --> 01:38:42.220]   He's got white too look at that we got to overnight next one

[01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:59.220]   Yeah, I am John as a matter of fact so the galaxy s3 comes in either either
[01:38:59.220 --> 01:39:02.500]   Pebble blue or

[01:39:08.460 --> 01:39:12.020]   There's actually a bunch of yachts pack parked parked out the turning basin right now
[01:39:12.020 --> 01:39:14.780]   But I didn't see him. Yeah, there's a ton of them. Huh?
[01:39:14.780 --> 01:39:18.220]   Google can I do this story now?
[01:39:18.220 --> 01:39:23.740]   What what story let me take a break come back and do more. There you go. What do you say you want it?
[01:39:23.740 --> 01:39:24.940]   You want to take a walk?

[01:40:08.660 --> 01:40:11.580]   There's a thing called a lock and key. I might have to get one
[01:40:11.580 --> 01:40:16.860]   We do have a cage in the basement, don't we but we've been keeping Burke down there. So I don't know if I
[01:40:16.860 --> 01:40:19.020]   That's what's
[01:40:19.020 --> 01:40:21.020]   That's what that noise is coming from
[01:40:21.020 --> 01:40:28.780]   Let me tell you about square space. You know what Burke could do that down he could actually create a square space site
[01:40:28.780 --> 01:40:31.260]   Let me add it here. Let's do it right now
[01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:34.260]   Let me let me do it right now help. I'm Burke
[01:40:34.260 --> 01:40:37.700]   McQuinn and
[01:40:37.700 --> 01:40:40.700]   Burke at
[01:40:40.700 --> 01:40:44.900]   Twit TV and we'll kind of call this help. I'm
[01:40:44.900 --> 01:40:49.060]   In the basement
[01:40:49.060 --> 01:40:55.540]   Dot squarespace calm and we'll make the password be let me out
[01:40:55.540 --> 01:41:01.140]   All right, so we're gonna create a new website now. This is the view. This is that's how easy it is to create a new website on
[01:41:01.140 --> 01:41:05.340]   And help. I'm in the basement and look it's already kind of you know boom
[01:41:05.340 --> 01:41:09.740]   These are the buttons up here. You can write revise publish
[01:41:09.740 --> 01:41:11.900]   build organize and architect
[01:41:11.900 --> 01:41:16.900]   This is where you can figure pages and widgets and you can add buttons and so forth and I got to tell you
[01:41:16.900 --> 01:41:19.460]   Let's start with the design and stock cuz they have so many great styles
[01:41:19.460 --> 01:41:23.940]   Built into here. This is the help. This is they really walk you through it
[01:41:23.940 --> 01:41:30.740]   I mean they make it as easy as possible. You've got hundreds of beautiful styles all professionally designed
[01:41:31.700 --> 01:41:39.180]   This is a usonian, which is a very nice clean one, but we can get we can get more templates once you start with a template then you will
[01:41:39.180 --> 01:41:43.420]   Pick some styles based on the template. I mean I just
[01:41:43.420 --> 01:41:50.060]   You couldn't be easier and the thing is it's great about this is each site is unique now another thing that's fantastic
[01:41:50.060 --> 01:41:56.500]   Is they have these great Google fonts? So I can I can modify this help them in the basement?
[01:41:56.500 --> 01:42:00.620]   I can choose from a variety 300 different fonts in the Google font library now
[01:42:00.620 --> 01:42:04.500]   That's what's cool because the Google font let's create a style and save that out all right

[01:44:01.860 --> 01:44:05.300]   It's the new verge. Who is the verge?

[01:44:31.780 --> 01:44:37.420]   We'll have something fun going on there. I just love squarespace. That's how easy it is to create a site very fast very easy
[01:44:37.420 --> 01:44:41.620]   Very very professional unless you do that
[01:44:43.300 --> 01:44:47.780]   Here's an album of pictures taken from project glass
[01:44:47.780 --> 01:44:50.900]   Are you gonna get these glasses?
[01:44:50.900 --> 01:44:54.340]   That's it one
[01:44:54.340 --> 01:45:00.540]   No, both of good. Thank goodness. These are all people wearing these. I think this was them from the Google+
[01:45:00.540 --> 01:45:08.820]   Conference oh they were handed now. I guess these are not working. I know there's a Google+ conference. Yeah photo conference
[01:45:08.820 --> 01:45:13.460]   Google+ photography conference look at Trey Radcliffe look at dashing in those
[01:45:13.460 --> 01:45:17.700]   I don't know if those were functioning or not. It seems unlikely seems does seem unlikely
[01:45:17.700 --> 01:45:21.900]   Let me see here
[01:45:21.900 --> 01:45:28.180]   Here's a video sample from the GLAP project pass those amends back you like those the Frank goes well
[01:45:28.180 --> 01:45:30.180]   I'll probably never have them again
[01:45:30.180 --> 01:45:36.740]   Little ad little ad
[01:45:37.300 --> 01:45:41.540]   So this is 15 seconds long a shot in 720p
[01:45:41.540 --> 01:45:45.940]   I don't know what I'm looking at is this an ad
[01:45:45.940 --> 01:45:48.980]   This is an ad
[01:45:48.980 --> 01:45:53.460]   Forget it. This is an ad. I don't even want to see it. There's like a beer ad making pay ya make me
[01:45:53.460 --> 01:45:59.180]   Yeah, they're gonna get mad. Oh here it is here. It is video from a Google glasses of a guy on a trampoline. I
[01:45:59.180 --> 01:46:06.900]   Don't know what that bell is. I think it's my chatroom keeps banging at me. That's a guy that's it right there
[01:46:06.900 --> 01:46:11.540]   See if you had a camera in your glasses, you could shoot this kind of video and now back probably not
[01:46:11.540 --> 01:46:14.660]   Looks like the beer ads at the beginning and the end
[01:46:14.660 --> 01:46:18.820]   Lord
[01:46:18.820 --> 01:46:22.980]   All right, I'm closing that I'm closing that
[01:46:22.980 --> 01:46:28.020]   Microsoft has asked Google to remove search results
[01:46:28.020 --> 01:46:34.340]   For Microsoft stuff, but they're gonna leave them on Bing now. This is an interesting way to oh this is dumb
[01:46:34.980 --> 01:46:39.300]   Google the nerve of these people you couldn't you can never navigate the Microsoft site
[01:46:39.300 --> 01:46:42.180]   Google says we get more than this is a story
[01:46:42.180 --> 01:46:47.380]   I kept trying to do more than 1.2 million takedown requests for search results every month
[01:46:47.380 --> 01:46:54.740]   And you know the number one complainant is Microsoft Microsoft. Yeah, they claim a copyright violation on half a million
[01:46:54.740 --> 01:46:57.780]   Search results and fringing search results
[01:46:57.780 --> 01:47:01.380]   You can find out because you can go through Google's transparency tool
[01:47:02.100 --> 01:47:08.100]   Some of these links are links to pirated Xbox content Google said okay. We'll take them down Microsoft Bing
[01:47:08.100 --> 01:47:13.780]   They're still there. So if you want to search for pirated Xbox content, where do you go Bing Bing?
[01:47:13.780 --> 01:47:23.060]   The number one organization demanding takedowns from Google is one of Microsoft's neighbors in Redmond, Washington a firm called market fly
[01:47:23.060 --> 01:47:26.180]   Which is also employed employed by Microsoft?
[01:47:28.260 --> 01:47:35.220]   So uh, presuming I guess that market fly is asking it to remove it on behalf of Microsoft since they're all Xbox
[01:47:35.220 --> 01:47:38.260]   issues
[01:47:38.260 --> 01:47:45.140]   It could be according to the Verge given the sheer size and complexity of sifting through and reporting hundreds of thousands of URLs each month
[01:47:45.140 --> 01:47:47.060]   Microsoft
[01:47:47.060 --> 01:47:49.060]   Can't do it
[01:47:49.060 --> 01:47:52.740]   Themselves that's funny. It's actually quite funny. That's right. Yeah
[01:47:53.540 --> 01:47:56.500]   Twitter says we'll support do not track in this stunning
[01:47:56.500 --> 01:48:00.900]   Admission that they don't really need to use do not track so we'll support it
[01:48:00.900 --> 01:48:05.940]   They have nothing to track. Yeah, don't drag anything. Why track so by the way?
[01:48:05.940 --> 01:48:13.380]   We at the channel devorek.com and also the devorek blog and the no agenda show dot com. Yes, we're not tracking anybody
[01:48:13.380 --> 01:48:15.380]   We've decided against it
[01:48:15.380 --> 01:48:21.940]   Thank you. It's a risk breaking. That should be a headline should John see the vorax says we will honor do not track requests. Yes
[01:48:22.660 --> 01:48:25.300]   I should do the same. You should you we track anybody
[01:48:25.300 --> 01:48:28.980]   John do we no we don't try
[01:48:28.980 --> 01:48:32.020]   Twit for he does some guy in the back does
[01:48:32.020 --> 01:48:34.980]   He's with the FBI. He's trying to now
[01:48:34.980 --> 01:48:41.060]   I would like you sir to pledge along with me and john c devorek that you too will honor do not track
[01:48:41.060 --> 01:48:44.500]   Will you will you will you pledge along with us sir?
[01:48:44.500 --> 01:48:47.380]   Wait a minute. That's berg
[01:48:47.380 --> 01:48:49.540]   Works for you
[01:48:50.660 --> 01:48:52.660]   Talking about a setup
[01:48:52.660 --> 01:48:57.860]   Ah, did you know that apple has a vibrating pen? Yeah, you should as a pen
[01:48:57.860 --> 01:49:02.980]   It's a patent it's a patent
[01:49:02.980 --> 01:49:08.820]   We don't know if they have the pen but they have patented a vibrating pen that makes noise according to mike elk
[01:49:08.820 --> 01:49:10.820]   It makes noise
[01:49:10.820 --> 01:49:15.300]   That's exactly noise. It's a haptic pen. Yeah
[01:49:16.740 --> 01:49:21.940]   It's a tiny speaker which is design abuse on touch screens to make you feel like you're actually writing
[01:49:21.940 --> 01:49:30.020]   Make the nice smooth screen feel like yeah, like yeah canvas or something burlap
[01:49:30.020 --> 01:49:33.700]   I don't pay that much attention to patents like this because I figure it could just be
[01:49:33.700 --> 01:49:37.940]   In it's like one of those just in case we want to make one patents
[01:49:37.940 --> 01:49:40.580]   Doesn't mean they're actually going to make it
[01:49:41.780 --> 01:49:46.500]   I think it'd be cool if you had a pen that had a speaker in like that and then as you as you wrote like j
[01:49:46.500 --> 01:49:49.300]   Oh, it would say j
[01:49:49.300 --> 01:49:51.220]   Oh
[01:49:51.220 --> 01:49:54.420]   The live scribe does that I think live scribble it actually an answer as you're writing
[01:49:54.420 --> 01:49:58.180]   Uh, it'll do the words. I think the words are different
[01:49:58.180 --> 01:50:00.340]   Microsoft
[01:50:00.340 --> 01:50:03.620]   NBC wants to buy microsoft share of msnbc.com and just
[01:50:03.620 --> 01:50:06.420]   have it to itself
[01:50:06.420 --> 01:50:10.020]   What does microsoft have to do? Why did why is I thought that deal was done long ago?
[01:50:10.100 --> 01:50:14.340]   They killed the tv, you know, mbc bought msnbc the tv network for microsoft
[01:50:14.340 --> 01:50:18.180]   But microsoft still owns a significant stake in msnbc.com
[01:50:18.180 --> 01:50:23.060]   Really? Yeah, huh? I don't know why I don't either
[01:50:23.060 --> 01:50:31.620]   Okay, I don't know what this headline means. I'm just gonna I'm just gonna read it and maybe you can parse it for me
[01:50:31.620 --> 01:50:34.420]   iPhone
[01:50:34.420 --> 01:50:40.820]   Theif's Disney Cruise adventure goes on public display in owner's facebook album
[01:50:40.820 --> 01:50:47.220]   See katie macafrey who owned an iphone has a public facebook photo album
[01:50:47.220 --> 01:50:51.540]   But apparently a Disney cruise ship employee named nelson
[01:50:51.540 --> 01:50:57.220]   Stoller phone and started taking pictures started taking pictures which are automatically uploading where
[01:50:57.220 --> 01:51:00.820]   To katie macafrey's facebook the problem with this world
[01:51:01.620 --> 01:51:06.260]   So katie has created basically the stolen iphone adventures gallery
[01:51:06.260 --> 01:51:11.300]   This is the guy
[01:51:11.300 --> 01:51:13.300]   She has the guys that is boyfriend
[01:51:13.300 --> 01:51:18.980]   Maybe it's his boyfriend. I don't know. I don't know who this is. It's not katie. This is nelson's girlfriend
[01:51:18.980 --> 01:51:23.140]   Or his mom katie, which is nice. She's captioning these
[01:51:23.140 --> 01:51:25.700]   Apparently she works at the spa
[01:51:27.540 --> 01:51:31.540]   Nelson likes to take photos of buildings in mexico with stolen phones. She says
[01:51:31.540 --> 01:51:35.220]   He also likes to take photos of kabos on lucas
[01:51:35.220 --> 01:51:38.100]   So this idiot doesn't know
[01:51:38.100 --> 01:51:43.780]   Unless he has no idea that he is posting these pictures. Are you sure this is in bogus?
[01:51:43.780 --> 01:51:47.780]   John you're such a cynic long just saying it's a hundred commercial
[01:51:47.780 --> 01:51:49.700]   Yeah
[01:51:49.700 --> 01:51:51.460]   Could be
[01:51:51.460 --> 01:51:55.700]   So it just seems by this the guy is an idiot. Well, how would he know he's on a boat?
[01:51:57.220 --> 01:52:01.220]   Would the can he go check his settings and see that he's linked to something? He does not pay any attention
[01:52:01.220 --> 01:52:06.740]   He's just taking pictures. They're on the phone. They appear on the phone. So he thinks he's got him. There he is. He's cool
[01:52:06.740 --> 01:52:12.740]   Very chill. She writes. I love it that she she is just captioning his pictures as he takes him
[01:52:12.740 --> 01:52:15.460]   Here's the crude dining room that nelson likes to eat in
[01:52:15.460 --> 01:52:21.140]   Here's a bird nelson needed a photo of
[01:52:23.780 --> 01:52:29.780]   By the way, harry, thank you for the friend request. I'm going to confirm that I'm going to refer confirm that right now
[01:52:29.780 --> 01:52:32.740]   That is so sweet your name wrong the first time. Yeah
[01:52:32.740 --> 01:52:37.460]   This is me. This is the real me now we're buddies you and me is that how it works
[01:52:37.460 --> 01:52:42.100]   If you ever steal my iphone expect trouble buddy. That's amazing. You can do that
[01:52:42.100 --> 01:52:45.140]   Acknowledge is stunning
[01:52:45.140 --> 01:52:51.460]   Apparently her phone was stolen last month and his photos are just making it now to her photo stream
[01:52:52.260 --> 01:52:54.260]   Uh, I presume at this point she's
[01:52:54.260 --> 01:52:59.140]   Reported him but she knows she knows exactly knows his name and for pal
[01:52:59.140 --> 01:53:02.900]   I think I probably took a lot of self pictures if you know what i'm saying
[01:53:02.900 --> 01:53:08.340]   There's probably some stuff in there that you have to pull. Oh, I didn't even think of that. You know these guys. She should circle him
[01:53:08.340 --> 01:53:10.820]   Yes, sir
[01:53:10.820 --> 01:53:15.780]   Uh, did you watch the space x launch? Very very cool the space x dragon three in the morning when it took off
[01:53:15.780 --> 01:53:18.260]   No, I didn't watch it. I watched a rerun
[01:53:19.300 --> 01:53:27.380]   Um, the space x dragon capsule has been captured by the iss is the first time a commercial really vehicle has ever landed at the international space station
[01:53:27.380 --> 01:53:33.780]   Was Boeing that's not a commercial company? Oh, it's Donald Douglas those guys they make jets and rockets
[01:53:33.780 --> 01:53:39.140]   Yeah, but those were at the bottom on the behalf of the u.s government. Oh, I thought nasa was a prime of these guys
[01:53:39.140 --> 01:53:41.220]   No, I don't think so
[01:53:41.220 --> 01:53:43.220]   For free
[01:53:43.220 --> 01:53:48.180]   They're trying to win the this elan musk is guys been in his uh, he spent his tesla money
[01:53:48.260 --> 01:53:51.700]   I'm telling you it's it's uh, stavros blowfeld you watch
[01:53:51.700 --> 01:53:54.660]   Starro's coming
[01:53:54.660 --> 01:53:56.660]   That is pretty that is pretty cool
[01:53:56.660 --> 01:53:59.300]   Uh, here's if video of the
[01:53:59.300 --> 01:54:02.500]   They have a big nasa contract or as
[01:54:02.500 --> 01:54:05.060]   Uh good sound says a big nasa
[01:54:05.060 --> 01:54:09.540]   Oh nasa nasa paid them for the shipment. I get it. So they're bringing
[01:54:09.540 --> 01:54:12.180]   Yeah, isn't that what Boeing did stuff up
[01:54:12.180 --> 01:54:16.100]   Mm. What did mcdonald Douglas?
[01:54:16.100 --> 01:54:21.300]   russian rocket rocket martin effort to them there's a 1.6 billion dollar counter. That's cool
[01:54:21.300 --> 01:54:27.620]   That's actually cool. So that means like this is now becoming like, you know commerce. Yeah, it's just rocketry on the cheap
[01:54:27.620 --> 01:54:29.540]   The ibm has
[01:54:29.540 --> 01:54:33.700]   Band syri from uh, it's the ibm building good idea
[01:54:33.700 --> 01:54:36.580]   If you work for ibm
[01:54:36.580 --> 01:54:41.140]   I'm sure the nsa wouldn't have a bunch of those in their offices either
[01:54:41.140 --> 01:54:44.980]   You can bring your iphone, but they block syri traffic
[01:54:45.380 --> 01:54:48.500]   Why because syri ships everything you say
[01:54:48.500 --> 01:54:52.580]   To a big data center in north carolina owned by apple
[01:54:52.580 --> 01:54:55.860]   And yet they a lot people use google
[01:54:55.860 --> 01:54:58.020]   Yeah, right
[01:54:58.020 --> 01:55:01.700]   ibm cio janet horen told mit technology review
[01:55:01.700 --> 01:55:07.300]   We banned syri because the company worries that the spoken queries might be stored elsewhere
[01:55:07.300 --> 01:55:13.620]   They will be well of course they will but what do you think apple's like combing them for
[01:55:14.420 --> 01:55:17.780]   Revelations about ibm if you're in stock investor be handy
[01:55:17.780 --> 01:55:20.420]   syri
[01:55:20.420 --> 01:55:24.900]   But the chat room's all over my case about my comment about the rocket what about it?
[01:55:24.900 --> 01:55:33.780]   Uh, you know, they're Boeing didn't they didn't launch the rocket. It was a nasa personnel. I think you're right. I agree. I agree
[01:55:33.780 --> 01:55:39.620]   Um, if you see if you've seen have any if you seen maybe harry saw this the leap 3d motion control
[01:55:40.020 --> 01:55:44.820]   That is great. That is the that if that works $70 which basically connects
[01:55:44.820 --> 01:55:49.220]   I wonder if it works, but if it works, this is the biggest deal going. Do I have you seen this thing?
[01:55:49.220 --> 01:55:53.380]   I've seen the video, but I want one. Yeah
[01:55:53.380 --> 01:56:00.500]   Um, it's one bad. This is going to be the hottest thing ever if it works as if it was advertised which i doubt by the way
[01:56:00.500 --> 01:56:07.220]   The company's a startup has significant funding it's scheduled launch early next year at $70 and this video has been removed by the user
[01:56:08.020 --> 01:56:10.020]   Yeah
[01:56:10.020 --> 01:56:12.020]   Well so much for that
[01:56:12.020 --> 01:56:22.420]   Pre-orders, but i'm not sure i'd want to order it if it's not available till january. That's a lot of wouldn't uh, just wait wait and and let somebody like kara or
[01:56:22.420 --> 01:56:27.380]   Do I review it? Yeah, well, he looks cool. I already said he wouldn't do it. Yeah
[01:56:27.380 --> 01:56:31.460]   I'll buy it. Yeah, you would for sure wait for me to buy it for 70 bucks
[01:56:31.460 --> 01:56:35.700]   You know 70 bucks is how much a it won't be a magic mouse or the magic trackpad
[01:56:36.820 --> 01:56:40.020]   So right to be worth it when it came out. It won't be 70 bucks
[01:56:40.020 --> 01:56:44.660]   So we've done all the juicy good stuff that we were gonna do now
[01:56:44.660 --> 01:56:52.340]   We did at the beginning of the show we front loaded the show so we could stop we can yeah go have us some fizzy water there is none
