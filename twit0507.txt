[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.920]   We'll talk about it with our panel, a great group
[00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.280]   to Christina Warren.

[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.600]   where we talk about the weeks.
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.440]   Tech News, we're going to have a great show for you.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.480]   Ian Thompson is here from the register.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.520]   Christina Warren from Mashable.com, Jason Einer,
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.040]   who was here last week for our 10th anniversary.
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.160]   He's back in Louisville at CBS Interactive,
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.280]   but he'll join us.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.680]   He's joining us by the sky.
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.320]   Before we get into that, though, I want to welcome an old friend
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.600]   who has kind of got his own podcast.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.520]   John Miller is the creator of the rest of Everest podcast
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.440]   at therestofeverist.com.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.000]   And John, I know you have great many friends in Kathmandu
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.200]   and Nepal that you've been to Everest many times.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.120]   And of course, this week, yesterday,
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.480]   devastating 7.9 earthquake hit Nepal.
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.560]   2,800 at last, Count Dad, probably many more.
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.520]   17 climbers killed Dan Fredenburg, who is a Google
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.160]   executive.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.360]   He was the director of privacy at the X Project at Google X,
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.680]   passed away at the base camp, just devastating.
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.920]   This is a YouTube picture.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:56.960]   How come we have this?
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.880]   This is one day later this video.
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:00.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.280]   Communications in Nepal are really difficult to come by,
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.800]   but all the climbers are using satellite modems
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.120]   and satellite phones.
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.440]   The Earth is starting to shake right now, but if you look
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.640]   and you'll see it, a wall of snow, a giant massive avalanche
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.120]   about to hit base camp.
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.160]   And it's really remarkable that so many survive, frankly.
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.680]   Yeah, that avalanche came from a mountain called Pmori,
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.200]   which is across base camp, right across from the Kumbu ice
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.600]   fall, which is what many people know of.
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.680]   But you just don't think of this kind of thing happening
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.280]   at base camp.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.080]   You think of it happening up further on the mountain.
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:41.160]   And Kathmandu itself mostly brick structures.
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.720]   Mortar, poorly, a lot of the structures fell.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.080]   Yeah, the construction there is certainly not
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.520]   like here in California where there's real standards.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.080]   Right.
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.280]   Well, there hasn't been an earthquake there in a while.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.360]   It sounds-- I wasn't familiar with how long it been,
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.360]   but it sounds like it hadn't been an earthquake
[00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.960]   of this magnitude since the '30s.
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:00.800]   Yeah.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:07.480]   So just nobody was prepared for this and just devastating.
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.320]   You've been in touch.
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.000]   There's actually-- it's interesting how the tech community
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.640]   has-- is in some ways prepared for this.
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.160]   Facebook has a site called Safety Check.
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.000]   And they started this-- I can't remember when,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.880]   but not so long ago, there was a devastating natural disaster.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.200]   And they created this.
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.600]   If you're on Facebook and you're near the site of a disaster,
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.480]   it will prompt you to post something to say, I'm OK.
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.440]   And then if you have friends in the area,
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.440]   as I know you do in Kathmandu, we were talking to Chris
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.720]   Markbard earlier, you can go there and find out
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.480]   at facebook.com/safetycheck.
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.120]   Google has a person finder.
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.800]   It's also in effect right now where you can search for people.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.520]   But a lot of people are missing and unknown.
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.440]   It really feels to me like social media,
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.160]   like Facebook is playing a leading role,
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.520]   and will continue to play a leading role in disasters
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:04.880]   as they occur, because certainly in this part of the world,
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.560]   most people-- their mobile phone is their computer,
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.240]   and they all use Facebook.
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.560]   I regularly chat with Sherpa friends as they're on-tracts.
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.320]   No kidding.
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.840]   Yeah.
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:15.560]   On Facebook.
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.480]   Yeah, and the mobile communications infrastructure
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:22.200]   is the main way that they communicate,
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.440]   because it's so expensive to run landlines.
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.520]   Everyone has cell phones.
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.040]   It's much less expensive, obviously,
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.160]   for the wireless to be put in.
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.120]   So they all have it.
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.160]   And so it's just really-- we've been getting much relief
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:41.800]   from getting reports that people are checked in safe.
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.240]   There are a number of charities you
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:47.240]   can give to some of the obvious ones, like UNICEF and CARE,
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.280]   Project SEVA are involved.
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.960]   But I'm happy to say that Apple is putting on the front pages.
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.840]   As I've done in the past of iTunes,
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.480]   click to give to the Red Cross to help out.
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:03.400]   So we just want to urge our viewers and listeners
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.120]   to do what they can.
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.480]   I used to plan to go back to Everest soon, right?
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.600]   Yeah, I mean, I wasn't planning on going this year.
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.720]   But I was thinking next year, we'll see what this comes down to.
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.800]   But yeah, this is very, very poor country.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.520]   A lot of income relies on tourism,
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.560]   which is obviously decimated at this point.
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:32.360]   And so it's important to get people safe and everything.
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.560]   But long-term recovery involves keeping
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:36.440]   the economy going.
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.920]   So there's all kinds of things that will be needed.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.520]   Well, it was kind of fortuitous that you were in the area.
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:49.120]   And I'm glad you could come by and give us a personal point of view.
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.520]   The rest of Everest is a great podcast for people who are intrigued
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.760]   by this area.
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:54.160]   And as you and Chris Mark are out of set,
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:58.760]   because both the people of Nepal are really a beautiful, warm people.
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.360]   And this is a terrible tragedy.
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:02.600]   Yeah, and Chris is going to be going back there in just over a month,
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:03.040]   if things--
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:03.400]   You see.
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.680]   If he decides to carry through, so there
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.880]   should be some more information in the family coming from there.
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:10.600]   Thank you, John.
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.160]   Appreciate it.
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.800]   The rest of Everest.com.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.440]   And just a kind of a heavy note, I understand.
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:19.080]   But I think this is a time when the tech community can--
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:19.960]   It's heavy to him.
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.160]   --get together and do something about this.
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.720]   Maybe donate a buck or two.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:25.960]   If each of you donated a buck or two,
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.040]   it'd be a quarter million bucks in there.
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:29.840]   Thank you, John.
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:30.520]   All right, thanks so much.
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.800]   Meanwhile, here we are talking about the eye watch.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:37.760]   Feels a little bit strange, doesn't it?
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.160]   Christina, did you get one?
[00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.240]   No, it doesn't come until June.
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.000]   I'm mad.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.160]   That's a very common plate I hear from a lot of people.
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.200]   No, it doesn't come to June.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.160]   So I'm wearing leases.
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:50.680]   I know.
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.560]   I was going to say, I've heard you're unhappy with it.
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.360]   If you don't want it, I'll buy it from you.
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.200]   No, I'm not that unhappy with it.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.920]   See, you're not that unhappy with it.
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.920]   I guess what I'm saying now, having had it for two days.
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:07.280]   So it's completely conceivable that in time,
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:11.640]   apps will come out that will make this more interesting.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:12.920]   I think it's a good looking watch.
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:16.400]   This is the 38 millimeters stainless steel with Milanese
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.920]   loop.
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.360]   You notice that what happened there?
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.720]   Because I took it off my wrist.
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.840]   It's asking for a passcode.
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.360]   It's aware of when it's on your wrist.
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.800]   And so the Apple Pay, for instance,
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.280]   once you authorize it from the phone,
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.440]   you have to tie it to an iPhone 5 or later,
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:36.040]   the Apple Pay will continue to work,
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:38.440]   even if the iPhone's not nearby.
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:40.840]   I'll enter the passcode so it can use it.
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:43.080]   Oh, I guess I decided it didn't need it.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.560]   Double tapping the-- I've learned a few things.
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.320]   Double tapping the-- first of all,
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.320]   this thing has more controls than an iPhone does.
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.520]   You've got a big Friends button on here.
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:56.960]   You've also got the crown, which both clicks and twirls.
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.080]   And you've got force touch.
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.760]   So look at this, though.
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:01.920]   Take a look at this.
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.360]   This is the icons.
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.520]   This was one thing that worried me.
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.600]   You can zoom in a little bit.
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:12.800]   It's dang hard to hit those icons.
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.400]   But I'll give you the bottom line taken
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.000]   that we could talk about the individual things.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.280]   It doesn't seem that much.
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.880]   I was hoping there's the Apple Pay.
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:22.720]   So now I would hold this near to a terminal if I double tap
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.240]   that.
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.680]   It doesn't seem to me to be significantly better
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.440]   than any of the other smart watches.
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:27.960]   No, I mean--
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.000]   Not in any real important way.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.280]   The big worry was battery life.
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.520]   And I've heard reasonable things about battery life.
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.040]   It's fine.
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:35.680]   You still got to recharge it every day or so.
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:36.560]   Yeah, but I don't mind that.
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:37.720]   The pebble you don't.
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.440]   But you do with Android Wear.
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.000]   I'm charging my phone every day.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.160]   It has a nice little magnetic puck.
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.760]   It goes right on the thing.
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.200]   And so it's easy to charge it.
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.120]   It charges fast.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.960]   It charges in a couple hours, about an hour, an hour and a half.
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.080]   So you could charge it.
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.000]   You can give it a little club nap if you wanted dinner
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.640]   before you go back out if it's low.
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.440]   Christina, what do you think of the looks of it?
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.000]   You have gone into Apple stores and tried the lot, I'm sure.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:01.480]   Oh, yes.
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:02.000]   Yeah, no, I love it.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.720]   Because you want the pink, the pale pink.
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.600]   I want the pale pink.
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.960]   Although now it's funny because when
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:09.920]   I looked at the Milanese loop in person, the one that actually
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.960]   you've got on a 38 millimeter, I really loved it.
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.640]   And I could actually-- looks like I could get that one.
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.160]   That one's shipping four to six weeks.
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.200]   But I don't know if that means that I would get it before
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.400]   after the one I've ordered.
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:23.120]   So I don't want to like-- I don't know, it might place a second
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.600]   order and see which one I get first.
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:28.400]   My take on this was I was hoping that Apple would kind of,
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:33.200]   as they have as they did with the iPod, the iPhone, the iPad,
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:37.480]   take an existing business and make a leap forward
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:40.920]   in usability so that what was kind of OK really became
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:45.000]   usable-- smartphone, tablets, music players.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.960]   And I feel like this is not substantially in any real way
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:55.120]   different than the Pebble or the Android Wear watches.
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.640]   I mean, it's fine.
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.880]   It's certainly a lot better looking.
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:58.440]   It's better looking.
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:10:58.920]   It is.
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.440]   It doesn't look so geeky.
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.120]   Which I think is honestly a big part of it, right?
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.680]   I mean, that would be my argument that has held back
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.480]   a lot of the other watches has been the looks.
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.240]   I mean, it's as much a fashion device as it is.
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.480]   Is it that fashionable though?
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.960]   You think that looks that fashionable?
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:12.640]   I do, actually.
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:13.880]   I think that looks really nice.
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.560]   I think that-- I think that looks really, really nice.
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.320]   Jason, you don't agree.
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.560]   God, no.
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:20.520]   I don't.
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:23.360]   But it's like Christine is saying, though,
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.800]   it is very personal.
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.720]   Some people-- there are people who dig it.
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:31.400]   From the first time they shoot it, when they unveiled it,
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.000]   I made the same noise that I just made there.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.320]   I just went there.
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:35.600]   I was like, what?
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:36.920]   This big square thing.
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.240]   You know what it reminds me of?
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:41.280]   And this is my immediate thought when I first saw it was,
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.840]   it reminds me of in the '80s.
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.400]   Remember those calculator watches in the '80s?
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:45.840]   Yeah, it's very much like that.
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:48.240]   And we thought they were so cool.
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.080]   I mean, I had one.
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:49.600]   Everybody had one.
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.720]   It didn't have Mickey tapping his toe.
[00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:52.920]   That's true.
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.440]   But we thought they were so cool.
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:57.440]   And then five or 10 years later, we were like, oh my god.
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:59.960]   We used to wear a topo later on our wrist.
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.800]   That thing was so hideous.
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.120]   And I kind of feel like the square is going to be--
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.560]   I think Apple will get there.
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.320]   I think that it's an evolution towards something
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.680]   that's going to be really slick looking.
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.680]   But I just felt like I wanted it to be thinner.
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:16.280]   I wanted it to maybe not be square, so, so square.
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:17.720]   I wanted it to be a little--
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:21.800]   I have a little more of a wow factor that most Apple products.
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:22.920]   And I just didn't with this.
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.200]   But it is a very personal thing.
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:27.240]   I do think some of the Android ones are as good looking--
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.080]   I think the model 360 looks OK.
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:29.600]   Yeah.
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.240]   Yeah, it's your dude.
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:31.920]   It's true.
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:32.920]   Yeah.
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:33.920]   Huge, right?
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.120]   This is exactly the huge two.
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:39.360]   This is big, but I mean, I tried the 38 millimeter on my wrist.
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.720]   And I have ridiculously small wrists.
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:47.560]   And to the point that the small band is actually--
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.880]   at least Apple was telling me they're kind of thinking
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:52.280]   it's probably more for children.
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.680]   Ironically, I'm getting from my wrist.
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.920]   And it looks great on my wrist.
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.480]   Whereas the Moto 360, you're right.
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:12:59.680]   It looks good.
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.480]   But if you've got a small wrist, I mean, it just works.
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:06.000]   And it's just-- it's such a male centric device.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.560]   Me personally, I'm kind of with you, Jason.
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.800]   I wish that maybe this had a slightly different look.
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:12.760]   I didn't know how much I liked the square at first.
[00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:16.000]   But I'm glad that there's finally a watch where they actually
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.120]   took into consideration that 50% of the public doesn't
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:22.720]   have gigantic wrists and made something that can at least
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.200]   be styled to be more feminine.
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.240]   That's good.
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.160]   I agree.
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.440]   So I'm glad to hear you say that because that was one of the things
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.440]   I wondered how many--
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:31.600]   so I've asked--
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.720]   I've tried to get it since where are there women that
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.120]   are excited about wearing it.
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:37.840]   I haven't found too many, but--
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:38.800]   Christina doesn't count.
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:39.800]   But you know how--
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:40.560]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:41.080]   You don't count.
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.080]   You're a geek.
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:42.600]   You're a geek.
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.800]   No, you're a geek.
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:45.120]   I'm a geek, but I also spend--
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:47.880]   I mean, but I also spend $500 on handbags.
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.320]   So you're fashion forward.
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.480]   Yes, definitely.
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.080]   You're a fashion forward geek.
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.080]   Yes.
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.320]   But I mean, you compare that, say, for example, the LG,
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.280]   which is a clunking great bit of technology
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.200]   which sits on your wrist.
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.040]   I've got fairly slim wrists as well.
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.560]   And I tried it on, and it just-- it looks horrific.
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:05.000]   I mean, the app watch does look pretty good,
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.840]   but I'm still not sold on the whole functionality.
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.280]   I don't think it does much for me.
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:11.640]   But I may be wrong.
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.800]   And maybe the time-- maybe apps will come out.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.360]   It'll blow me away.
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.400]   People are getting excited by things like, oh,
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.400]   I can touch the Shazam button.
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:20.760]   It'll hear songs.
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:22.160]   That doesn't matter to me.
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.040]   You can, unlike most-- you can't make phone calls
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.280]   on the Android Wear watches.
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:27.680]   You can only see that it calls coming in.
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:28.920]   Then you have to pick up your phone.
[00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:32.040]   You can make a phone call from this and talk to people.
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.040]   I'm not sure a lot of people are going to do that.
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:36.640]   You can talk to Siri on this.
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:39.240]   And actually, Siri seems to work better on this, frankly,
[00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:40.240]   than it does on the iPhone.
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:41.600]   I don't know why that is.
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:42.080]   That's what--
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.360]   Yeah, that's a CNET--
[00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:46.400]   their review, CNET's review on it said the same thing,
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.320]   that they felt like Siri worked better on the watch
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:50.080]   for some reason than it does on the phone.
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:53.200]   But I do agree with you, Leo, and that I
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:57.880]   think that there's not a lot of great functionality
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:01.120]   that knocks your socks off with this yet.
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.840]   I felt like they tried to do too much,
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.720]   and they were a little undisciplined with this.
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.560]   They didn't pick a few things and try to really make them
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.800]   great like they normally do.
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:14.200]   And so I think this shows that they're still--
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.320]   they're taking baby-- it's a baby steps out
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:20.040]   of the post-jobs era, right?
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:21.800]   Because the lack of discipline does, I think,
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:22.680]   show in that way.
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.040]   But there are a few things.
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:26.720]   I think that there are some glimmers of hope for me
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.880]   that make me think, OK, this I could see being pretty
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:30.400]   interesting.
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.720]   And one is the American Airlines thing.
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.280]   They worked with American Airlines.
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:37.280]   I think a couple other airlines too.
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:41.880]   But where it automatically will have your boarding pass.
[00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:43.040]   It'll put on there.
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:46.040]   It'll even show you flight and progress.
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:49.640]   It'll show you how much time is left and those kinds of things.
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.120]   That's pretty cool.
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.760]   You can have that on your phone.
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.760]   And that's cool.
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.360]   But I could see myself wanting to glance--
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:00.360]   there's a couple of glanceable things where I see, OK,
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.240]   that would make sense.
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.680]   And I would like having not without having
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:06.920]   to get out my phone every time I want to do that kind of thing.
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:09.960]   And I think that they would have laser focused on the stuff
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:14.720]   that would be better to just glance and not take out the phone.
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.880]   The better this product would have been.
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:19.720]   And I think they're still finding their way a little bit there.
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:20.120]   Yeah.
[00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:23.520]   I mean, if you've got to carry the smartphone with you anyway,
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:27.560]   then I don't really see that there's an awful lot there
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:29.840]   at the moment to justify what's a really quite high price
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:31.040]   tag for a bit of hardware that--
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.720]   Yeah, this one's 650 bucks.
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:33.320]   Yeah.
[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:36.880]   You know, as displayed on my wrist,
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:38.360]   you can get them for as little as 350.
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:40.720]   The one you're going to get, Christine, will be 350.
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.440]   No, the one I'm going to get is 750.
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:43.520]   Oh, never mind.
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:45.200]   You're going to get the stainless steel, huh?
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:51.560]   Yeah, stainless steel and the white pink modern buckle.
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.240]   Plus AppleCare, plus tax.
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:55.760]   Yeah, I did buy AppleCare with this because, gosh,
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.360]   only knows what else will happen to it.
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:57.920]   Exactly.
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.120]   And since seeing some people with the sport watch,
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.520]   she would have had some issues--
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:02.640]   Yeah, somebody dropped these.
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:04.520]   And there's a Google Plus.
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:05.480]   I saw it at Google Plus.
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:06.480]   Yeah, I saw that.
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:09.680]   And he's not happy with it, which makes sense.
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.160]   And I'm thinking, god, if I'm going
[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.040]   to spend this much on a watch or any item really,
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:14.840]   I always get the--
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:15.840]   It's also slow.
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:17.640]   Watch how-- this is launching Flipboard.
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:18.920]   It takes a long time.
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:19.600]   Well, this is it.
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:21.200]   I mean, it's version one of the technology.
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.200]   It's going to be outdated in 18 months.
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:26.040]   Yeah, how long it's taking to launch Flipboard?
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:28.360]   This is the processor, and this is
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.680]   the equivalent of an iPhone 4.
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:32.360]   I'm good.
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:32.860]   Yeah.
[00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:34.480]   It has a decent heart rate.
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.080]   I like the idea that it's always--
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:38.040]   every 10 minutes measures your heart rate.
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:43.720]   I wrote a bicycle in yesterday to test that.
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:47.200]   But nothing here on here is significant, in my opinion,
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:51.080]   significantly better or different than the existing
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:51.680]   smartwatches.
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.240]   All right, maybe you could say aesthetically,
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:53.960]   there's a difference.
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.280]   Although, that's a matter of opinion.
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:59.720]   And I really get from this is the strength of Apple's marketing,
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.920]   that instead of saying it vibrates, which is really
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:07.560]   all the taptic feedback is this vibration, the taptic engine
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:09.440]   will give you a subtle tap on your--
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:13.240]   it's an amazing marketing ability they have.
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:15.800]   And not to diminish it.
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:18.000]   I mean, the ability to tell a story like that
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.760]   and get people excited around something that is essentially
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:21.960]   just vibration.
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:22.960]   Yeah.
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:23.480]   Yeah.
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:24.960]   They tell better stories than anybody else.
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.040]   They tell great stories.
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:28.720]   The navigation on this watch is virtually identical
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:31.320]   to the navigation on my Moto 360.
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:33.800]   It vibrates when you're supposed to turn left or right.
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.400]   It doesn't vibrate slightly left or slightly right.
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.800]   This sort of feels like it's slightly left or slightly right.
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:40.240]   Yeah.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.240]   Not enough that I can't not look at the watch
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.320]   and know which way to go.
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:45.560]   But also, for navigation, you could
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.000]   run Apple Maps, which--
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.200]   But you have to use Apple Maps.
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:52.000]   Although, I presume Google and others will update their apps.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.200]   One of the things that happened that is very different
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:58.120]   is that before the watch even came out, 2,000 apps
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:01.440]   on the store, and there will be more all the time.
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:01.960]   Right.
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.160]   And that's different.
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:03.800]   That is different.
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:04.800]   And the one thing I would say, too,
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:05.840]   is these are all the apps that you're
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:07.560]   seeing with very few exceptions have
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:10.120]   been created by people who have not had access to the watch.
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:13.040]   They've had access to the simulator, which, to me,
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.400]   is actually a big difference.
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:18.120]   Because I think that right now, I think your criticisms are
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:19.080]   probably directly--
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:19.920]   are dead on.
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:23.120]   It's not demonstrably different from a pebble or from Android Wear.
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.520]   But you give this thing a few weeks
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.440]   with people who actually-- with developers actually
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.760]   having a chance to use it natively
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:34.040]   and start to create experiences with the hardware.
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:36.160]   I think that we might start seeing some really interesting
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:38.200]   things, because that's what we've seen in the past,
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:40.560]   with both the iPhone and especially with the iPad,
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:43.560]   where what we really saw come and make the devices
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:46.840]   in the platforms, frankly, so unique was after developers
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:48.880]   really had a chance to play with it.
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:51.160]   Because otherwise, I mean, this is just out the gate.
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:52.040]   You've got all these apps.
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:54.040]   But people are basically making extensions.
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:57.440]   And it's running little widgets on the screen.
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:01.960]   I'm looking forward to seeing where we are at WWDC.
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:04.960]   And I'm also looking forward to seeing how they open up the API
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:07.000]   is for this thing and allow it to do more stuff.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.040]   Yeah, it's definitely 1.0.
[00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:13.560]   It's very 1.0.
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:17.280]   But they have-- it's funny to see how different this company
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:19.040]   is from when the iPhone went out.
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:20.520]   And they were really not sure if they wanted
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:21.800]   third-party apps on it.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:24.320]   And third-party apps is what kind of made it.
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:27.240]   And they were way out front on this one.
[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.000]   But not having the product and being
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.080]   able to have the watch itself in their hands
[00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:35.240]   of the developers beforehand.
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:36.120]   It is a limitation.
[00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:39.040]   And like I said, there are some rays of hope
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:42.080]   where you can see, OK, this would be better
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:44.960]   having it here where it almost makes me
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:46.040]   want to wear a watch again.
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:49.360]   Like I said, the flight information on my wrist,
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:53.680]   being able to just glance at that, is an example.
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:57.840]   I think there are other things where you don't want to necessarily
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.200]   have your phone out.
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:02.840]   But I think that one of the bits that maybe is a little
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:06.800]   overblown is this idea of somehow it's less rude to look
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:07.800]   at your watch than your phone.
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:08.720]   I don't know about that.
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.880]   I think that's a little bit oversold.
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:14.440]   Because it's still the same as if we're having a conversation.
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.720]   And I'm looking at my watch.
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:19.880]   You know, that goes back a long time
[00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:21.240]   where it does pretty much a signal.
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:23.320]   Like I don't really want to talk to you anymore.
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:26.440]   I want to be more interested in leaving.
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:32.360]   And so yeah, I don't think that part is as significant as even
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:33.560]   Apple has kind of said.
[00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:36.280]   I'm like, oh, you know, you'll have less.
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:39.640]   You don't have to take your watch out of your smartphone
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:43.400]   of your pocket 27 times an hour or whatever.
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:44.840]   I think this is--
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.680]   I think this is one of the big disadvantages.
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.240]   The smart watch is that it's making people rude.
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.240]   If you're constantly checking your wrist when you're
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.480]   in the middle of a conversation, you might as well--
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:56.000]   You might as well just say to the person you're talking to,
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.760]   yeah, I'm not really interested in you.
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.080]   But look at this, isn't this great?
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.960]   And it's-- you know, whenever I try to smart watches on,
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:05.840]   you know, it gives a little vibrate, puts the notification up.
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.520]   And you've got to fight not to look at it.
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.840]   And if you're in the middle of a conversation with somebody.
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:12.720]   If you've got to take your smartphone out, that's also very rude.
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:14.360]   But, you know, actually having it on your wrist
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.240]   can encourage you at that glance.
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.840]   And honestly, if you look at it, you'll watch
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:19.360]   when you're talking to someone, you're really not
[00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:21.840]   doing them any favors at all.
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.280]   I'm going to send some random personal heartbeats.
[00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:27.480]   Somebody-- so you tap it with two fingers now.
[00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:30.040]   And by the way, I'm feeling the taptic engine.
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:31.120]   It's buzzing.
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:31.960]   It's vibrating.
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:34.600]   It's not some magical experience.
[00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:36.840]   You get annoyed with it, tweaking you every 50 minutes
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:38.440]   so you get up and have a walk around.
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:40.840]   Yeah, every hour.
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:44.600]   Even-- and Matt Howie wrote a very funny piece in Medium
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:46.280]   in which he complained about his Apple Watch,
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:47.600]   because he says, I went to the movies,
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.000]   and there's no easy way to dim this thing.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.080]   I think there is, but maybe he hadn't discovered it.
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.800]   And every hour, even though I'm watching a movie,
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.160]   it said, stand up.
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:59.400]   You can turn that off.
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:00.920]   And then you can turn a lot of this stuff off.
[00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:04.040]   I think there is going to be a period of discovery
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:05.360]   for a few weeks.
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:08.200]   I guess-- and maybe my opinion will come around.
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:10.800]   I don't hate it.
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.080]   I liked my Android Wear Watch as well.
[00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:14.600]   I liked my Pebble as well.
[00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:17.800]   I don't think they are necessary.
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:22.120]   I think for some people, they will be of some use.
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.640]   I feel like, though my biggest disappointment
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:28.240]   is I was really hoping for something magical from Apple
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:30.960]   that reinvented the category in some way,
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:32.480]   and that I am not seeing.
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:34.480]   Now, when the iPhone came out, it certainly
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.720]   reinvented smartphones.
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:38.200]   It was very much a 1.0 product.
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.680]   It was something from a hardware perspective.
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:41.000]   It was an absolute dog.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.920]   We put up with a lot of drop calls.
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:45.720]   Yeah, we put up with a lot of crap with it.
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:49.040]   But yet, I think there was this sense.
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:50.320]   This is going to change things.
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.160]   That this was exchanging things.
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.320]   That it was--
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.560]   Yeah.
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:57.320]   You couldn't help but look at that device when it first came out
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:58.960]   and go, whoa.
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.960]   This is going to--
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.240]   I still can't use this.
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.560]   I remember 80% of the time I still
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:05.920]   used my Blackberry because it was more useful.
[00:24:05.920 --> 00:24:11.960]   But with the iPhone, within two weeks of having it,
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:13.320]   I set it down.
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:17.960]   And my two-year-old picked it up, swiped across,
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:20.720]   tapped the photos app, and started swiping through photos.
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:22.480]   And I went, holy crap.
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:23.920]   Like, they're onto something.
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:26.440]   Like, anybody can use this device.
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:27.920]   And I was like, this is the future,
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:30.200]   even if it's not super usable to me right now.
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.920]   So I think that's what kind of you're getting at, right,
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:32.440]   Leo?
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:34.920]   Yeah, it looks like I have scratched it already.
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:36.040]   Well, that's too bad.
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:37.040]   That's not good.
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:37.520]   Yeah.
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:38.680]   I saw that in the reflection.
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:40.960]   I wondered if it was a scratch or if it was just a smuract.
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:41.960]   That's a smuract.
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:43.960]   [LAUGHS]
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:44.560]   Yeah.
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:45.960]   It's a scratched or cracked.
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:47.440]   This is the sapphire crystal.
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:48.680]   Wow.
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:51.680]   There is one killer app for the Apple Watch.
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:52.240]   What is that?
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:55.360]   Which is, if you see anyone wearing that 18-carat gold thing,
[00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:57.480]   you know instantly they're a wanker and you should be shung.
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:58.680]   You should beg detector.
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:00.480]   That's what Kevin Rose called it.
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:02.560]   Well, people are reporting that the stainless
[00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:03.960]   is getting some nicks and scratches.
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.960]   But I've never had a watch that didn't get that.
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.000]   But I am curious about this scratch on the screen.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.280]   I hope that that's not the case because I
[00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:13.160]   have to give this to Lisa when my 42 inch comes.
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:16.600]   So 42 millimeter, not 42 inch, sorry.
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.440]   Oh, this is a you need a case for it somehow.
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:20.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:21.440]   Oh, man.
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:22.400]   You laugh.
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:25.440]   There's a whole ecosystem already on Kickstarter
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:28.640]   of people creating bumpers and cases for the Apple Watch,
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:30.440]   which is ridiculous.
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.240]   But it's hilarious.
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:36.680]   If you scratch your $17,000 watch and try to bring it back,
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.800]   they're going to look at it with a microscope
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:41.880]   to make sure that you haven't scraped gold off of it
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.280]   as an investment.
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:44.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:48.360]   And then they're going to charge you $1,500 for the repair fee.
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:49.520]   Wow.
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:50.840]   Or maybe it's $1,000.
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:54.360]   I think the Apple care is $1,500, and then it's $1,000
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:55.840]   for the one time exchange.
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:57.240]   But that's for the expensive one.
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:58.520]   How much is my Apple care?
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:00.040]   I got the Apple Care Plus.
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:03.320]   If I bring this in now and say, look, the sapphire is scratched.
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:03.840]   How much?
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:05.200]   What'll happen?
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.200]   I think you've got to pay them.
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:07.760]   You'll see sapphires unscratchable.
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:09.960]   I think you've got to pay them $75,
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:11.320]   and they'll give you a new one.
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:12.520]   OK, that's good.
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:13.760]   I'm glad I bought that.
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:16.600]   Now, this poor fella, he has the sport watch.
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:19.200]   He claims-- this is the picture from Google+--
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.000]   that he put his hand in his pocket
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.760]   and the clasp released-- or pulled his hand out of the pocket--
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:27.080]   clasp released unexpectedly.
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:28.000]   The watch went flying.
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.280]   He hit something, obviously, and smashed it.
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:31.440]   Now, this is not sapphire.
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:32.640]   This is glass.
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:33.160]   Right.
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:34.360]   That's like their gorilla glass.
[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.640]   They're ion-portified glass or whatever.
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:37.680]   I mean, it is gorilla glass.
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:40.560]   We all know what Horning says that that Apple's partner,
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:43.520]   but we can't officially call it gorilla glass.
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:44.640]   But yeah.
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:45.160]   Yeah.
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:47.800]   My suspicion-- nobody's going to be able to bend this, though,
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:48.000]   right?
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.720]   I don't think this is bendable.
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:50.220]   No.
[00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:50.720]   No, it's not.
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:51.880]   Anything I've heard of.
[00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:52.360]   That would be impressive.
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:53.840]   I'm sure some people will try, but you know,
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:54.840]   that's impressive.
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:56.360]   You're going to see a lot of people
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:59.280]   with those broken pictures and so forth.
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:00.680]   I think it's fine.
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:02.280]   It's not bad.
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.040]   It is not earth-shattering.
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:05.940]   And I think that that's an important thing to say,
[00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:08.680]   because there will be people who say, you know, well,
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:09.440]   I feel bad.
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:10.640]   I can't afford one.
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:11.280]   I don't have one.
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:13.800]   I wasn't able to get one to the longest.
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.600]   No FOMO here.
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:18.160]   You're not missing anything.
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:19.400]   Can you say that?
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:20.520]   I say that.
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:22.080]   You say that, and you've got it on your wrist.
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:24.440]   You've got one on your wrist, yeah.
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:27.280]   Well, and one of the issues I'm going to have is,
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:29.440]   is it so much better than Android Wear
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:33.160]   that I will continue to use an iPhone versus my Galaxy S6
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.520]   Edge Android Wear watch?
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:37.840]   That's going to be a big question for people like you.
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:39.080]   For people like me who--
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:40.880]   You're all in on Apple.
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:41.680]   Yeah, I am.
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.680]   I mean, I have Android phones and I like Android,
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:46.360]   but yeah, I mean, I'm all in on their Apple ecosystem.
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:49.760]   So yeah, for me, it's this or Pebble, basically,
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:52.240]   which the irony is, when you get my Pebble time,
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.600]   before I get my Apple watch.
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:54.440]   Oh, man.
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.120]   Oh.
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:58.120]   For me, it's, will it make me wear a watch again?
[00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:00.080]   Because so I've been trying both of them.
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:03.800]   The tech republic's Apple watches,
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:08.240]   we're supposed to have it, but it's, we're still waiting on it.
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:08.840]   So--
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:13.160]   That's why I got up at midnight, my friend, on April 10th.
[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:16.040]   Because I knew Apple wasn't going to send me one.
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.440]   I'm not Feral.
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:19.040]   I'm not Katie Perry.
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:22.080]   But I knew that if I got up early enough, I could get one.
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:24.000]   And I didn't get both the ones I ordered.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.400]   I only got the 38 millimeter.
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:27.720]   I'm still waiting for a few weeks for the next one.
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:28.880]   I keep trying everything.
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.800]   Pebble, the Fitbit one.
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:31.800]   Me too.
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:36.040]   It's what I've worn the longest of any of them, obviously,
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:38.160]   until I saw how much I was--
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.040]   and then I realized how little I was sleeping in.
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:41.960]   I was like, I don't want to look at this anymore.
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:46.000]   I actually wore the crazy galaxy that's
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.960]   about the size of an iPhone that kind of wraps around your wrist.
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:50.760]   Oh my god.
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:52.640]   It has its own phone number.
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:53.480]   Right.
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:54.480]   Yeah.
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:57.320]   And it has a much better, bigger screen.
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:58.880]   I've worn them all.
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:02.040]   And on the one hand, I kind of say
[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:04.800]   there is a value to a smart watch.
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:08.920]   For notifications and for health reasons, there are some useful--
[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:10.320]   this is kind of useful.
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:11.520]   It's a luxury.
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:15.680]   I don't feel like anybody has to have it, unlike, say,
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:16.280]   smartphone.
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:18.720]   Were you crazy if you're still using a flip phone?
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:19.240]   Yeah.
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:23.360]   I think one of the key questions-- and this was touched on earlier--
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.960]   is would it make people change from being an Android user
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:28.360]   to getting an iPhone just to get the watch?
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:30.720]   And from what I've seen so far, not even close.
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.280]   It's the same with the Samsung one.
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:34.720]   You had to have a Samsung phone to use that.
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:37.320]   And it killed it.
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:39.440]   It's just I'm not getting a Samsung phone for loving a money.
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.320]   So it's just--
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:42.560]   Well, I even had a note for it, and I still didn't want to wear it.
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:43.320]   Yeah.
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:44.960]   Well, it gets a terrible watch.
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:47.400]   Well, you know, somebody called me on the radio show yesterday
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:50.400]   and said, I love-- he has the original Gear One.
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:52.440]   He says, I love my gear.
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:54.200]   And he makes calls on it and all sorts of things.
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:55.600]   Yeah, there's always people like that.
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:57.600]   There's always somebody.
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:58.080]   Wow.
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:29:58.600]   Yeah.
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:29:58.600]   Yeah.
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.960]   I just don't know if any of them can make me want to wear
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:02.200]   a watch again long term.
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.040]   I just kind of get tired of wearing a watch.
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:05.320]   You know, I've tried all of these--
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:07.120]   you know, all the Android ones too,
[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:08.400]   or a bunch of the Android ones.
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:10.920]   And there's cool things that they do.
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.440]   I agree with Christina.
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:13.320]   They're huge.
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:16.240]   And so I don't like how huge they are.
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.000]   And so that's sort of a turn off.
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.280]   I think they have to get smaller.
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:22.040]   But then the smaller they get, the sort of less use
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:26.600]   for the harder it is to actually use it to touch and tap
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:28.200]   once the screen is that small.
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.800]   And so it's a tough one.
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:31.400]   It's a tough one.
[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:34.560]   And I do think that I'm one of the people who
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:36.960]   should be interested because I do a lot of kind of fitness
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:37.560]   stuff.
[00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:40.920]   And I like analytics and those kind of things.
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:44.800]   I've had a Fitbit since Fitbits first started coming out
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:45.640]   and tried that.
[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:46.560]   And I've enjoyed that.
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:50.080]   And I've worn the ones that--
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:54.800]   the different ones on your wrist, the flex and then the charge.
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:57.680]   But even those, I always end up kind of getting a Fitbit key
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:01.760]   and not really wanting to wear it on my wrist
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:02.960]   after a while, like a watch.
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:05.560]   Just because once I started using a smartphone,
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:07.200]   I quit wearing watches.
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:09.440]   And I think a lot of people are like that.
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:13.400]   And I do think the Pebble guy, CEO Eric, said that he said
[00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:14.720]   the best thing.
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:15.760]   And I think he was exactly right.
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:16.960]   He said this at CES last year.
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:19.240]   He said, our biggest competition is not Samsung.
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:20.000]   It's not Sony.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.560]   Those were the two big ones at the time
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:23.720]   that were making smart watches.
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:25.840]   It's people not wanting to wear watches anymore.
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:27.200]   And I still think that's the case.
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.160]   And I think it's the case for Apple, too.
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:31.600]   Christina, if they had a really good Tamagotchi app on this,
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:34.760]   would you think that would put it over the top?
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:36.560]   I don't know why I'm asking you that.
[00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:39.000]   Well, I had this game hatch on my iPhone.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   I have a virtual pet on my iPhone.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.680]   See, I somehow do.
[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:44.960]   Somehow you knew no, hatch needs to come out
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:47.120]   with the Tamagotchi app or somebody needs to.
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:48.600]   And that will make it amazing.
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:51.120]   Then I could stroke my watch and keep my hatch happy.
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:51.960]   My hatch like that.
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:53.840]   What I really want to is I want somebody
[00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:57.640]   to create Snake, the old Nokia Snake game.
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:58.960]   That should be easy.
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:31:59.360]   Right?
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:00.680]   And then you have to just look around.
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:01.200]   Well, what?
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.120]   Like that would be amazing.
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:04.840]   If you want to kill your battery fast, put a game on here.
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:05.360]   Right.
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:06.400]   That's the downside.
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:08.360]   Yeah.
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:10.560]   Android Wear, by the way, what's really interesting
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:13.200]   is that Apple took so long to release this watch
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:17.280]   and did so little to further the game that Android Wear actually
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:18.680]   has an opportunity to keep up.
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:20.760]   Google's already released an update for Android Wear
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:22.960]   just a few days ago that apparently is going
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:24.520]   to add Wi-Fi capability.
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:27.560]   I'm not sure if all watches will be able to do this or what.
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:29.080]   They've added emoji drawing.
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:31.320]   So if you feel left out that you can't draw a picture
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:34.520]   to your loved one, you can now do this in Android Wear,
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:37.320]   not that anybody would want this.
[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:40.240]   But I think this Wi-Fi support is what's most interesting.
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:43.880]   The Apple watch, as long as the watch is on your Wi-Fi network,
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.240]   will communicate with the phone.
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:47.000]   So I brought my phone out here, but I didn't need to.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:48.400]   I could have left it in the office.
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:50.880]   And I think that's great, because almost all of us
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:54.840]   are on Wi-Fi most of the time, right, except we're on the road.
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:58.400]   Apparently, this will happen to Android Wear as well.
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:01.040]   And what's interesting about this, it won't just be Wi-Fi.
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.360]   It'll be internet.
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:06.320]   So if you're-- and I think this will require additional hardware.
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:09.240]   But if you're like the LG or Bain,
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:13.520]   if you're watching it online, it will communicate with your phone,
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:15.680]   even if you left your phone at home.
[00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:16.440]   It's a really good--
[00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:17.520]   It's a really good mechanism.
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:20.280]   But it's going to suck on battery life, because I mean,
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:22.760]   if I'm batteries, do not go together very well at all.
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:24.160]   Well, that's the big challenge, isn't it?
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:24.920]   And I like the opposite bars.
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:25.800]   But I mean, it's just--
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:27.040]   Dux and acid bats?
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:30.640]   Well, you have a vivid imagination.
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:34.320]   No, seriously, the big problem is battery life.
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:38.160]   And Wi-Fi is not very good with getting with battery life.
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:40.000]   So that is going to be an issue for it.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.160]   Unlike some of the other things they've done with the Wear update,
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:46.000]   I think the gesture control could be tricky, considering
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.320]   people flinging their wrists around in the middle of meetings
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:49.520]   isn't going to look particularly good.
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:51.560]   But they're getting there, and they've
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:54.360]   got an opportunity for a straight fight with Apple now on this one.
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:55.000]   I think it is.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.320]   I think it's close enough.
[00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:00.440]   When the iPhone came out, they just left everybody in the dust.
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:02.920]   And it took Android years to catch up.
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:05.640]   We had to didn't even exist when the iPhone came out.
[00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:07.680]   I think at this point, Apple took long enough.
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:09.000]   They took a long time to get this watch out.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.760]   They might have given the other guys a chance to at least still be in the fight.
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:14.960]   So I'll wear this.
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:15.460]   Go ahead.
[00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:16.760]   The thing that I think they got-- sorry.
[00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:19.160]   The thing that I think that they advantage they may have,
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:21.920]   Leo is in working with--
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:23.960]   working with ecosystem.
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:27.000]   They've gotten pretty good at working with ecosystem.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.200]   And so I think that in the same way they did with iPod,
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:33.680]   and eventually with iPhone and iPad 2,
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:36.280]   is working with health care providers.
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:38.880]   So all and equipment makers.
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:40.840]   So I can see the day--
[00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:42.720]   the Apple Watch taking off to the point
[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:48.920]   that it works with all of the equipment at your gym easily syncs.
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:51.120]   And you can sync your data to your Apple Watch.
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:57.200]   I see it working with the big motor companies, where it's a fob
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:00.880]   and gets you in your car, where maybe it can work with security companies.
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:04.520]   And you can use it to scan instead of your badge and things like that.
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:07.480]   I think that their win with this thing
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:11.960]   might be the ecosystem win, where because it's one platform
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:16.960]   and it's one company to work with versus Android being
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:20.600]   so distributed, that they could win with partnerships,
[00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:24.440]   where an Apple Pay is another example, too, where all of a sudden
[00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:27.960]   they can make this thing interact with lots of things
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:31.200]   in the world, out there in the world, the internet of things.
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:36.080]   And all of a sudden, the Apple Watch becomes significantly more
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:38.600]   useful because of those partnerships.
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:40.800]   I think that's the best shot at winning with it.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.600]   They've already got that with the Starwood Group.
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:46.040]   They say 100 hotels already will allow you to walk in the door
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:48.080]   with your Apple Watch and go straight to your room,
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:51.160]   unlock the door, and go to bed.
[00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:52.960]   I mean, that's just scratching the surface.
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:53.720]   Imagine them doing it.
[00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:56.960]   And they've gotten really good at this, right?
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:00.200]   Because of the things that they've done in the past,
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:03.800]   what they've had to do with Apple Pay and other things
[00:36:03.800 --> 00:36:05.600]   they've gotten really good at partnering,
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:09.440]   and they have a lot of trust in the corporate world suddenly.
[00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:12.640]   And so that, I think, is a chance for them
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:14.960]   to really do some significant and interesting things
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:17.600]   that makes this more useful than just the glance
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:18.360]   of the information.
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:19.360]   Of course, the folks that I've fixed
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:22.400]   have already taken it apart and found a couple
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:24.880]   of interesting things.
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:29.480]   One is that there is an additional meter in there
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:31.720]   that Apple does not expose at this point.
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.440]   In addition to the heart rate meter,
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:36.320]   apparently the Apple Watch has a chip in there
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:39.840]   and the takeability of measuring blood oxygen levels.
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:41.360]   And I don't know if they didn't turn it on
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:44.040]   because it didn't work or they're
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:47.680]   waiting to do maybe a rollout of something additional.
[00:36:47.680 --> 00:36:48.120]   Maybe--
[00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:50.320]   As a sailor, I'm just having nightmare visions
[00:36:50.320 --> 00:36:52.960]   of falling off the boat in the middle of the Atlantic
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:53.760]   and still go--
[00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:54.000]   You're drowning.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   You appear to be drowning.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.440]   You appear to be like some helpful--
[00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:58.120]   You're drowning.
[00:36:58.120 --> 00:37:00.840]   This is relatively waterproof.
[00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:04.560]   Somebody put it under water for 15 minutes and it survived.
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:06.800]   You could shower with it.
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:13.680]   Although, didn't Joanna say that she got toothpaste in hers
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:15.280]   and she--
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:17.800]   I think it broke her stem.
[00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:19.800]   I think she did.
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:20.360]   Anyway.
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:21.000]   Toothpaste.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.920]   Well, she used to think she should never let--
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:24.440]   Yeah.
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:25.040]   You saw that.
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:27.960]   It was great piece in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:31.240]   Joanna had a helmet with a camera on it
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:34.040]   and followed herself around with a watch all day.
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:36.960]   One-play Rupert Murdoch says, what's you wearing there?
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.240]   And she says it's the new Apple Watch.
[00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:40.360]   He takes it and leaves.
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:41.760]   So maybe Rupert broke the stem.
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:44.080]   I'm certainly willing to believe that.
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:46.200]   But all right.
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:46.760]   I'm surprised.
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:48.760]   So nobody in Mashable has one yet, huh?
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:49.720]   Lance Hulinoff does.
[00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:50.600]   Lance had one.
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:51.120]   All right.
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:51.480]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:54.160]   He's had one since the reviews came out.
[00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:54.640]   Oh, good.
[00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:55.160]   OK.
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:55.680]   So yeah.
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:56.160]   He--
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:56.760]   What's he saying?
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:57.260]   He loves it.
[00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:57.760]   Does he like it?
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:37:58.200]   He loves it.
[00:37:58.200 --> 00:37:58.680]   He loves it.
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:37:59.180]   Yeah.
[00:37:59.180 --> 00:37:59.680]   Yeah.
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:02.120]   I mean, he'd been wearing a pebble steel for almost a year
[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:04.760]   and was honestly pretty skeptical about it.
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:06.960]   And he walked away actually being
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:09.360]   a big fan of the Apple Watch.
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.240]   I think there are two kinds of people in the world.
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:14.680]   People who wear smart watches and people who don't.
[00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:16.280]   And if you're in the smart watch camp,
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:17.200]   this is a good choice.
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:18.560]   You have to be an iPhone user.
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.040]   And if you're an iPhone user, you really
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:21.000]   haven't had many choices.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.320]   You've had pebble or this.
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:23.640]   This is going to be the way to go.
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:25.080]   If you're an Android user, I don't
[00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:26.240]   think you should feel left behind.
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:30.160]   I think Android Wear, there's some really good choices
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:30.800]   for Android Wear.
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:33.440]   There are some good Android smartphones,
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:37.040]   but Sir Johnny is an absolute genius when it comes to design.
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:39.560]   And he does make stuff very, very pretty.
[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:43.440]   Not just design, but telling the story, the words he uses
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:45.040]   to paint a picture.
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:47.760]   And that's what I'm coming away with mostly from this is
[00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:51.160]   an amazing job by Apple and by Sir Johnny
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:55.240]   of creating a story around this watch that is compelling
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:57.120]   and is pushing people to go into the store
[00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:59.440]   and spend as much as $17,000.
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:01.440]   It's the Apple reality distortion field.
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:04.080]   We've seen it time and again, and they're really, really good
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:06.040]   at it.
[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:08.720]   But there's a limit to how far good marketing will get you.
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:11.200]   I mean, iOS 6 was marketed to hell and back,
[00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:13.440]   and it was still a dog of an operating system initially.
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:14.800]   Yeah.
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:15.400]   Well, there it is.
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:17.400]   That's the-- we're not going to talk anymore about it.
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:19.640]   I'll give you guys a chance to finish things off
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:23.080]   if there's anything else you want to say about it.
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:25.960]   Do you think Christina that-- I mean, it's already sold
[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:31.000]   like twice what every other smart watch has sold put together?
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:31.480]   Yep.
[00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:33.160]   But that just means there's a lot of good--
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:33.920]   that's good marketing.
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:36.280]   That doesn't mean anything, because that's site unseen.
[00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:37.600]   Yeah, that's basically a site unseen.
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:39.560]   I think that the big test is going to be one state.
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:42.280]   I think actually there are two big tests.
[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:44.680]   One, let's see the first wave of apps that are actually
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:46.960]   developed by people who have access to the watch.
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:49.360]   Because I think that'll drastically change the experience.
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:51.320]   Number two, and I think that this is almost more important,
[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:56.520]   is that they need to get the production cycles down
[00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:58.760]   so that they can actually get these things out to people.
[00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:00.440]   Because I'm not getting in mind--
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:01.320]   You're frustrated.
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:02.320]   You're really frustrated.
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:03.320]   I am really frustrated.
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.840]   Because it's the-- from everything I can tell,
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:08.800]   it is the band rather than the watch itself that
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:09.920]   is the hold up.
[00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:13.040]   And that's-- you know, I mean, get the supply--
[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:14.960]   Apple is so good at supply chain dynamics,
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:17.080]   but in this case, it really seems like they went into it
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:18.040]   blind.
[00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:20.480]   And no, it's frustrating to buy something
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:22.160]   and to not get it for two months.
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:23.880]   That's a frustrating experience.
[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:26.160]   It's not have enough to actually have them in stores.
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:27.760]   I think that they want this to take off.
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:31.160]   This is the time where they risk losing momentum
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:34.520]   if people can't have it for a couple of months.
[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:36.120]   That's a real problem.
[00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:38.560]   So I am glad that they're making it easy for developers
[00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:40.880]   or easier, I guess I should say, for developers
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:42.760]   to get access to a watch really.
[00:40:42.760 --> 00:40:44.040]   That's a good thing.
[00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:46.280]   But I think that getting the supply chain dynamics correct
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:49.400]   and having the first wave of watch apps actually
[00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:52.080]   built by people who have access to the watch
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:54.560]   will make a big difference going forward.
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:55.560]   Ann, what do you think?
[00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:57.520]   They also leave-- they're charging way too much for the bands,
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:58.040]   too.
[00:40:58.040 --> 00:40:58.560]   Oh, sorry.
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:00.000]   They're charging way too much for the bands.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:00.480]   This is on--
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:02.800]   The villainy's loop is $150 by itself.
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:03.800]   Yeah, that's fine.
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:07.480]   Still-- I mean, but some of these bands are like $200.
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.360]   I know the one--
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:12.000]   The other one I'm getting is $250 by itself, which yeah.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.160]   What?
[00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:14.640]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:16.320]   I mean, honestly, it's fashion.
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:18.920]   So I guess it's a weird thing.
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:21.040]   You're depending on where you sit on the fashion spectrum.
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:23.960]   You either go with that's insane or if you're insane like me,
[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:24.760]   you go, I don't know.
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:26.680]   That seems about right.
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:28.360]   I think it's easy to take the band off.
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:30.120]   And so Apple hopes that-- let me see.
[00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:31.400]   I've not taken mine off.
[00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:34.280]   Yeah, I think it's an industry standard connecting point.
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:34.800]   Oh, is it?
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:36.880]   So you should be able to swap out other--
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:38.120]   Not just apples.
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:38.400]   Yeah.
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:39.400]   Any kind of pins.
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:39.880]   Yeah.
[00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:42.360]   So this is the standard this thing?
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:43.160]   Yeah.
[00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:44.160]   Ah.
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:44.360]   Yeah.
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:45.400]   Well, I do love that.
[00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:47.360]   And I've-- you know, other watches--
[00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:47.840]   it's hard.
[00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:48.800]   You've got to get the pins out.
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:51.520]   You have to buy a special knocking hammer,
[00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:53.000]   knocking tool to do it.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:53.800]   This was very easy.
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:54.720]   It's the first time I've done it.
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:57.080]   And I was able to take it apart very quickly.
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:58.560]   And so I think that the idea that you
[00:41:58.560 --> 00:42:01.280]   could have multiple bands-- one for night, one for elegant,
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:02.560]   one for sport.
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:04.480]   Well, if they're challenging 250 for a band,
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:08.880]   then that's going to rack up a lot of funds very quickly.
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:10.920]   It reminds me what you should do with RAM.
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:14.760]   Remember how RAM upgrades for Macs used to be just insane?
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:17.240]   It would be like 300 bucks for RAM,
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:18.680]   where you could get it for 100 bucks.
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:20.680]   If you just went through--
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:22.640]   get it to yourself, to upgrade yourself.
[00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:23.840]   It sort of reminds me of that.
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:26.680]   They're sort of making extra on the accessories,
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:27.920]   which seems a little silly.
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:31.600]   But like I said, I do think the success or failure of this
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:34.320]   is watch the ecosystem play, because they haven't--
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:36.560]   they've been a good job of selling it.
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:38.560]   Even if the product they've been a little undisciplined on,
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:40.240]   their storytelling is brilliant.
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:44.240]   And if they nail it on the ecosystem thing,
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:46.080]   they could turn this into something
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:49.320]   that's far more useful.
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:52.480]   And then what they've lacked a little bit
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:56.360]   in some of the focus on the product itself,
[00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:59.520]   in terms of really focusing us on a few things
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:02.360]   that it can do really, really well.
[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:04.760]   Because they have that opportunity again to partner
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:06.720]   and do some really big things, whether it's
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:09.360]   from checking in with flights, checking into your room,
[00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:11.960]   checking in, being able to scan into your building,
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:14.680]   two-factor authentication, all of those kinds of things,
[00:43:14.680 --> 00:43:16.720]   I think, could turn this into something
[00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:22.160]   that would be useful and really a product that turns
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:24.800]   into something you'd want to put on your wrist again.
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:28.440]   That's all that I can see that would make me want to wear it.
[00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:31.720]   And a lot of people that I know that are on the fence about it
[00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:34.760]   and aren't sure if they want to wear one again, same thing,
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:37.360]   it's going to take something like that to change their minds.
[00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:40.480]   And let's not discount the status value of this.
[00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:41.440]   It makes me proud.
[00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:44.160]   I keep waiting for somebody to notice that I'm wearing.
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:46.200]   Did you notice I'm wearing an apple?
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:47.720]   Honestly, and so he mentioned it.
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:49.280]   I didn't, but I can see it.
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:51.080]   I mean, I remember when the iPhone came out,
[00:43:51.080 --> 00:43:53.360]   there was a real static thing about using it in public.
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:55.360]   And people, a friend of mine had one,
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:57.520]   but it's a, it's just great.
[00:43:57.520 --> 00:44:00.600]   We came up to me and talked to me just to talk about the telephone.
[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:02.120]   I was like, wow.
[00:44:02.120 --> 00:44:03.720]   That's kind of sad.
[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:05.360]   But you know, to each their own.
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:07.400]   You only get a few days of that, but the first person
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:09.280]   to have an iPad, and when you get on the plane,
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:10.600]   you get a lot of attention.
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:11.520]   First, I don't know.
[00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:12.360]   I haven't gotten any attention.
[00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:15.600]   Nobody has yet said to me, oh, is that the new Apple Watch?
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:16.440]   Can I look at that?
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:17.520]   Not one person.
[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:19.560]   It looks like a watch.
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:21.120]   That could be the mugger's next move.
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:22.600]   Oh, can I take a look at that?
[00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:23.440]   Can I take a look at that?
[00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:24.440]   Right.
[00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:26.560]   If you press this button, does it come right off?
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:27.960]   Yes, it does.
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:29.400]   All right, enough about the Apple Watch.
[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:30.240]   Let's take a break.
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:31.240]   We got lots more to talk about.
[00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:35.720]   I think we now know what Elon Musk is going to announce
[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:37.280]   at the end of the month in just a few days.
[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:38.520]   And I'm excited about that.
[00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:41.440]   But lots more Ian Thompson is here from the Register.
[00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:42.760]   Great to have you as always.
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:45.760]   The register.co.uk.
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:46.960]   It's like a-- what is it?
[00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:48.680]   A baby duck and acid and acid?
[00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:50.360]   We know the phrase--
[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:51.160]   Every time you're here--
[00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:52.000]   A duck to water.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:52.840]   A duck to water.
[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:54.120]   A word Smith.
[00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:54.720]   I love this.
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:58.680]   Every time you're here, I learn something new in terms
[00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:01.160]   of word smithing.
[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:03.680]   Christina Warren from Mashable.com.
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:07.040]   Film girl at film_girl on the Twitter.
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:09.320]   Jason Hire, einer from--
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:10.800]   I still want to say tech republic,
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:12.920]   but we'll say CBS interactive.
[00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:13.440]   That's fine.
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:13.960]   I had a one.
[00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:14.400]   Either one.
[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:15.600]   They're both.
[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:17.560]   And thank you for writing a nice article
[00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:19.360]   about the return of the screen savers.
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:20.760]   I appreciate that.
[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:21.400]   Yeah, that was fun.
[00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:22.800]   We're excited.
[00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:25.360]   The new screen savers starts--
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:26.400]   this is coming Saturday.
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:28.720]   I'll tell you a little more about that later.
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:31.360]   Our show today brought to you by MyRaser.
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:32.760]   Harry's.
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:35.800]   We've got to become a Harry's company here.
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:38.320]   Everybody here shaves with Harry's razors.
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:40.600]   They're so great.
[00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:43.360]   Harry's decided they were going to change the razor business.
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:46.520]   They're going to a drugstore, persuading somebody
[00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:49.120]   to unlock the razor blade case.
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:51.600]   So you can get your $4 blade out there.
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:52.960]   Harry said, we're going to do it easy.
[00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:53.960]   We're going to send you the blade.
[00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:55.480]   We're going to make them in our own factory
[00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:57.480]   and beautiful factory in Germany.
[00:45:57.480 --> 00:45:59.280]   We're going to design and engineer them
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:01.760]   for performance, for sharpness.
[00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:04.240]   And we're going to get them to you for about half the cost
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:07.120]   of those expensive fusion blades.
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:08.320]   About $2 a blade.
[00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:10.120]   It's a great deal.
[00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:13.560]   Harry's gives you high quality razors at half the price.
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:17.760]   They engineer them to be great blades, performance and sharp,
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:19.800]   and then they ship them free to your door.
[00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:22.600]   Now, I want you to go to harry's.com and get started.
[00:46:22.600 --> 00:46:24.640]   See the Harry's kits?
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:26.240]   This is the way to begin.
[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:28.480]   And boy, they make this affordable with a Truman kit,
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:30.040]   which is $15.
[00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:32.840]   You get the handle, and you get your choice of colors.
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:34.080]   You get three blades.
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:35.720]   You get the travel blade cover, which
[00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:37.920]   is not to be dismissed.
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:40.200]   That is actually a very handy thing.
[00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:44.320]   You also get your choice of the fuming shave gel, which
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:48.200]   most people like, although I'm kind of partial to the cream.
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:49.520]   But you get your choice.
[00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:52.560]   And then you can sign up for a monthly subscription.
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:53.760]   They also have the Winston set.
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:54.520]   They've just added.
[00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:58.240]   And I just ordered it the stand for your razor, which
[00:46:58.240 --> 00:46:59.360]   is kind of cool.
[00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:01.480]   Is that on the page there somewhere?
[00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:04.720]   They have a nice little stand that you could put your razor in.
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:07.120]   There it is.
[00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:07.840]   I just ordered this.
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:11.600]   And you get this engraved so that you can have his and her
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:13.360]   stands, which I do.
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:15.240]   I was going to say, is there something to look it in there
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:17.160]   so I can stop my wife using it while I'm on the line?
[00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:18.280]   Exactly.
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:20.640]   You tap your watch to it, and it pops out.
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:21.800]   For your print scanner.
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:22.600]   Yeah.
[00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:24.040]   That's a great idea.
[00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:25.560]   Now, what we did is we just got them.
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:26.520]   You can get the Winston's.
[00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:27.400]   You can get engraved.
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:29.280]   So I have Leo and Lisa.
[00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:30.840]   So we know which is which.
[00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:32.920]   I love Harry's.
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:34.360]   I think you'll love Harry's too.
[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:35.400]   Visit harry's.com.
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:37.680]   You can take $5 off your first purchase, which
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:41.920]   makes that Truman kid an amazing deal at $10.
[00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:43.680]   If you go to harry's.com and use the offer code
[00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:47.040]   TWIT5, twit in the number five at checkout.
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:48.360]   Harry's.
[00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:49.360]   We love it.
[00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:51.000]   It's the best shave you'll ever get.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:52.840]   harry's.com.
[00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:56.200]   Use the offer code TWIT5 to save $5 on a checkout.
[00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:58.600]   So Elon Musk tweeted, and by the way,
[00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:02.720]   added $1 billion to the value of Tesla.
[00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:04.280]   And probably attracted hackers too,
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:06.000]   because I think he got hacked yesterday.
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:06.920]   Yeah.
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:09.160]   So all of a sudden started getting tweets from going,
[00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:11.320]   hang on, he's not really putting his phone number up there.
[00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:12.640]   Yeah, somebody said call me.
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:12.920]   It is.
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:14.520]   Yeah.
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:17.720]   That was kind of weird.
[00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:19.000]   But anyway, he tweeted a month ago
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.320]   that April 30th, he was going to make a big announcement.
[00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:24.120]   And it wasn't going to be a car announcement.
[00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:25.920]   Well, some report.
[00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:29.600]   I mean, an intrepid reporter has gone around asking
[00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:31.280]   some questions.
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:33.920]   And it seems to be trip chowdry.
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:35.720]   I guess he's an analyst.
[00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:39.120]   It seems to be pretty clear that he is going to announce
[00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:42.440]   a $13,000 battery.
[00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:44.040]   Now, you may say that's ridiculous,
[00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:46.680]   but in fact, this is an incredible deal.
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:47.280]   Yes.
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:48.800]   Yes.
[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:51.840]   I will say as a californ, as a californ who's now living
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:54.520]   in California, I would be severely tempted by that.
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:55.880]   I'm going to buy one right away.
[00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:58.120]   First of all, PG, any subsidizes it by half.
[00:48:58.120 --> 00:48:58.600]   Right.
[00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:01.720]   So and you can amortize it over a long period of time.
[00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:04.440]   So the deal is this is a home battery.
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:07.120]   Trip chowdry, who is an investment analyst,
[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:08.080]   kind of asked people.
[00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:14.800]   And apparently, Tesla, which owns a company-- or Elon
[00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:17.200]   is a chief executive chairman and a major shareholder
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:18.800]   in a company called SolarCity--
[00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:22.640]   has already been testing this battery with 300 customers.
[00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:25.160]   So Trip was smart enough to go around.
[00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:26.680]   He met a couple of metrayed shows.
[00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:27.200]   He asked him.
[00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:28.000]   He talked about it.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.240]   He pressed for details.
[00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:31.000]   Here is what he learned.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.840]   And we think this is probably what Elon's going to announce.
[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:38.560]   The system is offered in 10 and 15 kilowatt hour configurations.
[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:43.160]   The idea, of course, would be if you have solar, most of the time,
[00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:45.280]   if you want to store that, you have
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:48.560]   to get these massive arrays of lead acid batteries, car
[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:51.640]   batteries in your basement or your garage or somewhere.
[00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:52.520]   They're explosive.
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:53.680]   They're dangerous.
[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:55.720]   So most people don't store the juice.
[00:49:55.720 --> 00:49:57.800]   They just sell it back to the utility company.
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:50:00.120]   And so it reduces their utility bills.
[00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:02.480]   But if you could, it would be awesome to store it
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:06.680]   in case of a power outage or you want to cut off the grid.
[00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:09.040]   So this is enough to do that.
[00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:10.440]   PG&E is here.
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:13.680]   And I imagine other companies would do this.
[00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:15.840]   Offers a 50% rebate.
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:20.040]   They like it because you can get your power in off peak hours,
[00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:23.480]   store it in the battery, and then use it during peak hours.
[00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:25.720]   They will set up the financing for the customer
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:28.000]   to make an additional $1,500 payment.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.520]   This is, again, trips research.
[00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:33.240]   This may change when the actual product is announced,
[00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:38.280]   followed by $15 a month payments for 10 years.
[00:50:38.280 --> 00:50:40.360]   So it's relatively affordable.
[00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:46.240]   And if you've got solar, it makes so much sense.
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:51.840]   A lot of the problem with all of the renewable energy,
[00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:56.000]   new forms of clean energy is storage and transmission.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.760]   Our grid was not meant for these types of power.
[00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:03.240]   And so we lose lots of it, solar, especially.
[00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:06.520]   The transmission of it, you lose a lot of it in transmission.
[00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:09.240]   And so it is better to store it in a way.
[00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:11.480]   And if you're selling it back to-- also,
[00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:13.280]   you have the problem that if you're selling it back
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:18.240]   to the power company, they're charging you
[00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:19.800]   whatever they want, right?
[00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:23.120]   Or they're basically paying you whatever they want.
[00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:24.320]   There's no competition.
[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:26.320]   And so they can make money off you, right?
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:28.200]   They can buy that from you for a certain amount
[00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:31.680]   and then sell it to someone else at a higher price.
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:34.320]   And so you're at their mercy.
[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:37.560]   Now, if you can store that power yourself,
[00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:40.800]   then all of a sudden, you're taking
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:44.640]   some of the power out of the hands of the power company, which
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:47.960]   is very much a monopoly in almost every case.
[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:53.400]   And now, you can be off the grid and you can do a lot yourself.
[00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:55.200]   You can use it to power your hybrid.
[00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:56.920]   You can use it to power your electric car.
[00:51:56.920 --> 00:52:02.200]   You can use it to store up in case of a power outage.
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:04.360]   You can use it in lots of different ways.
[00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:08.000]   And so this is one of those things that a number of people
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.480]   have said that essentially Tesla, what they may become,
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:12.320]   is more of a battery and company.
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:16.640]   And it's basically a power storage company.
[00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:18.480]   And they may sell their battery technology.
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:20.760]   Because that's sort of their secret sauce in many ways
[00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:22.040]   is what they've done with battery.
[00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:24.400]   People have actually bought electric cars
[00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:27.280]   and taken them apart to get access to all the lithium ion
[00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:28.400]   batteries.
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:29.840]   Yeah, right.
[00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:32.560]   You can do a mod on, say, for example, a Toyota Prius
[00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:34.520]   so that in the event of a power outage,
[00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:37.120]   you can use the power in the Prius and run the engine
[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:38.760]   to power up certain aspects of your car.
[00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:39.520]   That's a good idea.
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:41.080]   It's like a little generator on wheels.
[00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:43.680]   Yeah, but it's a really tough mod to do on the car.
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:45.480]   But something like this, I mean, particularly
[00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:46.840]   if you're working with-- if you've
[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:48.240]   done that, signed up with SolarCity
[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:50.680]   and you've got solar panels on top of your house,
[00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:52.560]   this is a great way to store it.
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:53.200]   And it's safe.
[00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:54.320]   We live in an earthquake zone.
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:56.960]   So who wouldn't want to rely on that?
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:59.560]   First Tesla's building a factory in the Nevada desert,
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:02.720]   their giga factory to make lithium ion batteries.
[00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:04.680]   That goes online in 2017.
[00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:10.160]   So this all kind of makes sense as a move for Elon Musk
[00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:12.320]   and Tesla.
[00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:16.480]   We'll find out April 30th, a few days, what he's planning.
[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:18.560]   But I like this idea a lot.
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:20.600]   And as they point out in the Guardian article,
[00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:24.240]   so many of us, really, with our computers and our smartphones
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:26.680]   and our smart watches, the power goes out.
[00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:28.560]   It is debilitating.
[00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:31.680]   It's the worst thing that could happen.
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:33.480]   During Hurricane Sandy here, I mean,
[00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:34.640]   that was one of the big problems,
[00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:38.120]   was that power went out all over the main part of the city.
[00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:40.080]   And I was very fortunate that we didn't even
[00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:41.720]   lose internet in Brooklyn.
[00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:43.960]   But I had colleagues who literally--
[00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:44.760]   Devastated.
[00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:48.080]   --completely devastated, where I had people who were--
[00:53:48.080 --> 00:53:49.920]   their urban buildings were flooded out.
[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:53.280]   I mean, but the power was out in the city for a week.
[00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:58.080]   And you think about just how many things we rely on,
[00:53:58.080 --> 00:53:59.200]   the rely on power.
[00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:03.800]   I mean, I'm fortunate that I have a gas powered stove.
[00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:06.000]   But even if you think about, if you're
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.120]   in a place where you have electric stove and other things,
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:10.160]   it's like if the power goes out, you're literally
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:11.920]   SOL on so many levels.
[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:14.440]   So I think this is great, at least for some sort
[00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:15.360]   of generator options.
[00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:17.080]   And if not, just for the additional power
[00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:19.160]   saving and environmental concerns.
[00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:21.680]   We're on a well, so if the power goes out for more than a few
[00:54:21.680 --> 00:54:24.040]   hours, we're going to be drinking the hot tub.
[00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:26.960]   So I don't really want to do that.
[00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:27.480]   So--
[00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:29.160]   No, you don't.
[00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:30.760]   But you were right, Jim Sandey.
[00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:33.920]   They were doing bucket trips upstairs
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:35.400]   to get diesel into server rooms.
[00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:36.080]   Do you remember that?
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:36.560]   Yeah, it's gross.
[00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:37.080]   Yeah.
[00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:37.580]   Yeah.
[00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:39.080]   And to keep things going on.
[00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:41.640]   Keep a room full of these batteries in place.
[00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:44.240]   And Bob's relatively--
[00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:46.720]   Bob's not too-- it's not too difficult to actually keep
[00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:49.360]   this thing running for a little while longer.
[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:49.840]   I'm excited.
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:53.440]   We'll find out very soon.
[00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:55.640]   Did you see-- we were talking about IFixit.
[00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:59.000]   Kyle Wiens, who is the founder of IFixit and his president,
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.760]   wrote a really strong article, I thought,
[00:55:00.760 --> 00:55:03.480]   for Wired magazine.
[00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:08.680]   "We can't let John Deere destroy the very idea of ownership."
[00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:11.200]   Turns out, there are consumer protection laws
[00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:14.040]   in the United States that prevent car companies
[00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:16.520]   from copywriting the code and from preventing you
[00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:18.200]   from fixing your car.
[00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:20.480]   But there isn't anything protecting tractors.
[00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:22.280]   So John Deere, which makes, of course,
[00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:25.600]   these $100,000 combines and tractors,
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:29.280]   these very powerful devices, have applied to the copyright
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:35.080]   office saying farmers don't own these tractors.
[00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:37.800]   Because of the computer code, the farmers
[00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:40.640]   get an implied license for the life of the vehicle
[00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:42.960]   to operate it.
[00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:45.280]   It's John Deere's tractor, right, Kyle.
[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:46.840]   So you're just driving it.
[00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:48.920]   Several manufacturers submitted similar comments
[00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:53.760]   to the copyright office saying the DMCA, the 1998 copyright
[00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:58.760]   law, protects the copyright on the code and our tractors.
[00:55:58.760 --> 00:56:01.160]   You cannot modify them.
[00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:04.320]   And you don't own them.
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:06.000]   So if you want to fix your tractor,
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:09.440]   you have to go to John Deere authorized service
[00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:11.960]   representative and pay whatever he says,
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:14.080]   because only he has the cute computer
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:16.960]   equipment that can fix that.
[00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:18.640]   And this is really about big data.
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:21.360]   John Deere figured out a couple years ago
[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:23.440]   that the future of their business
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:30.160]   is all of that data that they are harvesting, essentially.
[00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:31.440]   Sorry for the--
[00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:34.360]   That was a really funny question.
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:35.200]   Sorry for that one.
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:35.840]   It's a thinking man.
[00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:36.800]   It's good.
[00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:37.320]   I like it.
[00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:38.760]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:40.880]   They are harvesting all that data,
[00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:43.880]   because that data in the commodities business, which
[00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:46.000]   is what all of their customers are in,
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:48.920]   is absolutely invaluable.
[00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:53.160]   If you're a farmer and you know what your competitors
[00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:54.560]   and your neighbors and all of that,
[00:56:54.560 --> 00:56:57.440]   what they're selling their stuff to market for,
[00:56:57.440 --> 00:57:00.240]   and what their yield is and all those kinds of things,
[00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:03.320]   then all of a sudden that information is gold.
[00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:06.480]   And John Deere is now sitting on that information,
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:08.320]   and they can sell that to farmers.
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:09.400]   And they can--
[00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:12.520]   One of the arguments the company gave to the copyright office
[00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:16.160]   is if we allow owners to mess around with a code
[00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:18.680]   in the tractor, they might pirate music
[00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:20.160]   through the vehicle center statement.
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:21.000]   Are you serious?
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:23.840]   Oh my god.
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:27.520]   They're hoping the music industry will support this.
[00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:30.400]   I think the music industry is like, yeah, you know what?
[00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:31.280]   What?
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:31.840]   Wow.
[00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:32.920]   I stand corrected, by the way.
[00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:34.760]   Apparently we have some farmers in our chat room.
[00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:39.040]   They say the combine is $300,000.
[00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:43.080]   The tractor is $150,000.
[00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:46.640]   So you're talking $300,000 to $500,000 for one of these.
[00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:48.320]   Oh, that just to borrow the HUD with the--
[00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:49.760]   And you don't own it.
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:52.960]   You're only borrowing it from John Deere.
[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:55.840]   There is a law going through Congress right now
[00:57:55.840 --> 00:58:00.520]   to do the very same thing to vehicles, to regular cars.
[00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:03.040]   You really do want to write your Congress Critter and say,
[00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:07.680]   you know, I like the idea that I can fix my car, myself.
[00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:08.200]   Right.
[00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:11.280]   I can buy third-party OBD2 connectors
[00:58:11.280 --> 00:58:12.760]   and look at the data in my car.
[00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:15.080]   And I want to keep that right.
[00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:16.000]   Right.
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.760]   I mean, the irony is, I mean, yeah, OK,
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:19.280]   so you might be able to want to fix it.
[00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:21.320]   But that era of being able to fix your own cars
[00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:22.680]   is slowly going away.
[00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:24.440]   I used to get out of my Volkswagen
[00:58:24.440 --> 00:58:26.160]   and I'd set the timing.
[00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:27.000]   And I'd change the--
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:27.360]   Exactly.
[00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:30.240]   --losing the oil, bolt, and change the oil in the filter.
[00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:31.640]   I used to be able to do all that stuff.
[00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:33.400]   No, my husband and I talk about this all the time.
[00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:35.840]   And obviously in New York, we all drive.
[00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:37.280]   But yeah, but I mean, that's the whole thing.
[00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:38.280]   We used to be able to do that.
[00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:41.400]   And now you would have to have a really expensive setup
[00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:42.520]   to be able to do that stuff.
[00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:45.640]   So I mean, whether there's a law in place or not,
[00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:48.960]   effectively the industry is kind of making it
[00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:51.240]   so that you've got to go to these authorized or at least--
[00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:54.040]   I want to hack my tractor so I could take the governor off
[00:58:54.040 --> 00:58:56.280]   and go 90 miles an hour down the freeway.
[00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:57.600]   That's what I want to--
[00:58:57.600 --> 00:58:59.560]   Well, I mean, that is something that insurance companies
[00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:00.640]   are increasingly doing now.
[00:59:00.640 --> 00:59:02.560]   If you get into a car wreck, someone
[00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:04.440]   will take care of it to make sure your engine has
[00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:05.160]   been chipped.
[00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:05.680]   Yeah.
[00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:05.920]   It has been.
[00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:06.520]   You're screwed.
[00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:08.080]   Yeah, that's a very good point.
[00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:10.720]   And I think in some ways, farmers are maybe more used to this
[00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:12.840]   because they don't own their corn seeds either.
[00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:13.040]   Right?
[00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:16.040]   Monsanto makes sure that the genetically modified corn
[00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:18.680]   is only leased because in the old days--
[00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:20.680]   remember the old days you'd plant a crop
[00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:22.480]   and then you'd take a little bit of that crop
[00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:24.040]   and you'd use it for seed next year?
[00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:26.320]   Can't do that.
[00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:28.840]   In fact, it didn't Monsanto soothe somebody who was--
[00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:30.040]   They sued seed saucers.
[00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:30.560]   Yeah.
[00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:33.760]   Because the seeds were blowing over the fence.
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:35.840]   Yes.
[00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:40.040]   He had corn and he didn't pay for the corn.
[00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:42.120]   Well, it was also a problem because he was an organic farmer
[00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:43.760]   and this stuff was GMO.
[00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:45.880]   So he didn't want it in his field in the first place.
[00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:47.600]   But they successfully managed to sue him
[00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:50.760]   for theft of their intellectual property.
[00:59:50.760 --> 00:59:52.600]   It's crazy ridiculous.
[00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:53.840]   But they went up--
[00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:54.840]   Sorry.
[00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:55.400]   There.
[00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:56.520]   Sorry, go ahead.
[00:59:56.520 --> 00:59:58.400]   Oh, it's just they went after the seed sorting industry
[00:59:58.400 --> 00:59:58.840]   as well.
[00:59:58.840 --> 01:00:01.520]   So it's harder and harder for farmers to actually get
[01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:04.400]   their own seeds and make their own crops that way.
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:06.480]   It's an attempt to do a Microsoft on the seed industry,
[01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:08.520]   basically.
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:09.400]   Yeah, they--
[01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:13.360]   And Monsanto is also into this big data and farming business,
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:13.520]   too.
[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:15.920]   We wrote a long form article about this on Tech Republic
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:19.080]   called, "How Big Data Is Going to Help Feed 9 Billion People
[01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:20.120]   By 2050?"
[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:21.120]   Wow.
[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:22.120]   Yeah.
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:28.440]   And it's about how Monsanto and John Deere, particularly,
[01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:32.840]   are using this data and, again, harvesting this data
[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:36.480]   to manipulate farmers, to manipulate markets.
[01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:39.240]   And they understand that this is the future,
[01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:41.520]   and they're trying to get a step ahead of farmers.
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:44.160]   And the farmers-- there are people out there
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:46.040]   that are helping farmers band together
[01:00:46.040 --> 01:00:48.440]   to make sure that they can control their own data,
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:50.040]   to make sure that they can--
[01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:53.280]   that they realize the value of this data and all this.
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:55.240]   So there's almost like this big data
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:56.960]   war coming in farming.
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:58.120]   And it's important stuff.
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:00.880]   And these companies are trying to get ahead of it.
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:05.480]   And I really do feel like this article, which Kyle wrote,
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:07.600]   which is really well done.
[01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:10.080]   But I think at the root of this is sort of John Deere
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:12.320]   wanting to make sure that they have control of that data.
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:13.520]   Yeah.
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:16.160]   Wow, isn't that interesting?
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:17.200]   We're going to take a break.
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:19.680]   Come back with more with our great panel, Christina Warren.
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:20.680]   John--
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:22.400]   John.
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:23.440]   Ian.
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:25.480]   Isn't John-- Ian a version of John--
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:26.800]   Ian is like a Welsh--
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:27.800]   It's like a Welsh guy.
[01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:28.640]   A Welsh guy.
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:29.720]   Oh my god.
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:31.800]   Do I look like I interfere with sheep, young man?
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:32.560]   No.
[01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:35.160]   No, my father's Scots.
[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:37.600]   And Ian is the Scottish version of John.
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:38.840]   Scottish version of John.
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:43.280]   Ian Thompson is here in Jason Heiner from the Tech
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:45.680]   Republic.
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:47.480]   Before we get to the gazelle ad, I
[01:01:47.480 --> 01:01:48.760]   wanted to show a couple of things.
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:50.640]   First of all, you know that this Saturday we
[01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:54.440]   are launching the new screen savers.
[01:01:54.440 --> 01:01:57.360]   For many years, people have said, oh, Leo, obviously,
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:01:59.240]   you're building Twitter to recreate tech TV.
[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:01.080]   I said, no, that's crazy.
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:02.480]   Who would want to do that?
[01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:04.720]   And people would ask me all the time,
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:07.200]   when are you bringing back the screen savers?
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:09.760]   And I said, well, I'm not going to, because that was something
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:10.260]   we did.
[01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:13.960]   I don't want to be a county fair nostalgia act.
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:17.240]   But at the same time, we noticed from our New Year's Eve
[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:19.160]   broadcast of the last couple of years
[01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:22.640]   that a variety-- we felt like we needed a variety show.
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:24.240]   There was a lot of stuff we wanted to cover.
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:28.080]   You couldn't make a weekly show out of, like, cord cutting
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:31.480]   or cooking.
[01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:34.440]   There's a lot of stuff we wanted to talk about that geeks do
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:35.920]   or are interested in.
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:38.000]   So we thought, what if we had a variety show?
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.640]   Gee, has anybody ever done a geek variety show?
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:42.760]   And then I thought, oh, yeah, I did.
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:44.960]   So we decided, now's the time.
[01:02:44.960 --> 01:02:45.880]   I've got the studio.
[01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:46.720]   I've got the staff.
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:47.880]   I've got the people.
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:50.760]   And let me-- do you have Jason?
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:54.600]   So we borrowed some segues a couple of weeks ago.
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:57.160]   We went for a ride and look what happened.
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.500]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:03.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:06.460]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:09.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:12.420]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:15.400]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:18.380]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:21.360]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:24.340]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:27.320]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:30.300]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:33.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:36.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:39.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:42.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:45.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:48.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:51.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:54.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:57.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:03:59.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:02.360]   So we figure we'll do a Sabado Gigantico every Saturday
[01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:04.600]   afternoon, right after the radio show about 3 p.m.
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:08.040]   Pacific's 6 p.m. Eastern time, 2200 starting May 2,
[01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:09.220]   this coming Saturday.
[01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:11.640]   And my co-host for the first episode
[01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:15.240]   will be my co-host for the last episode, Patrick Norton
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:16.200]   will join us.
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:17.480]   And so that's going to be a lot of fun.
[01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:18.920]   We're very excited about that.
[01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:20.120]   We had a great week on Twitter.
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:20.920]   Did you miss anything?
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:23.920]   Here is a little compilation of some of what you missed.
[01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:25.880]   Previously on Twitter.
[01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:26.920]   Oh, baby.
[01:04:26.920 --> 01:04:27.920]   OK, here it is.
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:29.640]   Oh, baby, there she is.
[01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:30.920]   Before you buy.
[01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:33.400]   Hold the Apple Watch up to the camera.
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:34.240]   Really?
[01:04:34.240 --> 01:04:34.740]   OK.
[01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:35.400]   Isn't that clever?
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:37.040]   An unboxing of the Apple Watch.
[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:39.960]   We know that you want one because everyone wants one.
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:41.080]   This week in Google.
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:45.240]   A Google finally announced its wireless carrier business.
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:48.000]   It's called Google 5.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.360]   This would easily be the least expensive mobile system.
[01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:52.400]   Here's the catch.
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:54.880]   You've got to have a Nexus 6 phone.
[01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:56.160]   Tech news today.
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:57.600]   Ding dong, the deal is dead.
[01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:00.720]   Comcast this morning announced that they're ending their $45 billion
[01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:02.880]   bid for Time Warner Cable.
[01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:05.840]   The combined companies would have controlled 57% of the US
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:08.920]   broadband market and just 30% of pay television service
[01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:12.040]   in an industry that's conspicuous for lack of competition
[01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:13.520]   in most markets.
[01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:14.800]   iPad today.
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:15.960]   Teenagers love to be scared.
[01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:17.600]   That's when you go to horror movies.
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:21.680]   This is easily the scariest game I've ever played on the iPad.
[01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:22.960]   Is that Hillary Clinton in there?
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:23.360]   Yeah.
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:25.080]   That's one of the things that's scary.
[01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:27.600]   Twitter now also available in several colors
[01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:29.160]   of unapologetic plastic.
[01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:29.520]   Yes.
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:34.880]   The Star Wars lightsaber barbecue tog.
[01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:37.320]   We press the magic button.
[01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:42.160]   Oh my god.
[01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:43.280]   I love it.
[01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:44.920]   This week is going to be another big one.
[01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:47.120]   Mike Elgin, what's ahead?
[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:49.400]   Coming up this week, Apple reports earnings tomorrow.
[01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:52.440]   The Interop Show begins in Las Vegas tomorrow as well.
[01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:55.040]   And Twitter reports earnings on Tuesday.
[01:05:55.040 --> 01:05:57.560]   LG will unveil its new G4 phone Tuesday,
[01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:59.440]   but then start selling it on Wednesday,
[01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:01.200]   but only in Korea at first.
[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:03.920]   Yelp and Samsung report earnings Wednesday, also on Wednesday.
[01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:06.920]   The Microsoft Build Conference kicks off in San Francisco
[01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:09.600]   and LinkedIn and Nokia report earnings on Thursday.
[01:06:09.600 --> 01:06:12.600]   But the big news is that Tesla will make a big announcement
[01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:16.360]   Thursday evening, probably to unveil a new home battery
[01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:17.400]   technology.
[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:19.040]   That's what's coming up in the week ahead.
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:19.720]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:20.160]   Thank you, Mike.
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:22.840]   And you know, we'll be covering it in whatever happens.
[01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:25.920]   Starting at 10 in the morning, Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern
[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:29.920]   Time, 1700 UTC with Mike Elgin and Tech News today,
[01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:32.320]   and then throughout the rest of the day.
[01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:34.120]   Actually, we're going to have a fun one on Friday,
[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:36.400]   because Build is in San Francisco.
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:39.600]   Paul Therott and Mary Jo are going to come up after Build.
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:42.200]   Microsoft has a lot to talk about with Windows 10.
[01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:43.680]   They'll be in town for that.
[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:47.400]   They're going to bring some other famous Microsoft
[01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:49.040]   Windows journalists.
[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:52.240]   And we'll have a very special version of Windows Weekly.
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:54.680]   That's going to be 2 p.m. Pacific, 5 p.m. Eastern
[01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:58.200]   on Friday, 2100 UTC.
[01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:00.560]   Not on its normal time Wednesday morning.
[01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:05.680]   So Friday for Windows Weekly this week.
[01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:07.840]   Our show today brought to you by Gazelle.
[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:10.840]   If you're trying to save up some money for your new Apple
[01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:13.200]   Watch or your new, you know, whatever,
[01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:15.160]   maybe you want to sell some of those old gadgets.
[01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:17.640]   Gazelle's a great place to go to get top dollar for your old
[01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:18.040]   gadgets.
[01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:18.960]   They make it easy.
[01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:21.080]   In fact, they give you 30 days.
[01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:23.040]   So get a quote now.
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:25.480]   Find some stuff in your drawers.
[01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:28.120]   I bet you there's a few things gathering dust in your drawers
[01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:28.560]   right now.
[01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:32.960]   And bring it-- what?
[01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:35.760]   And bring it to Gazelle.
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.040]   I know there is in mine.
[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:37.480]   All right?
[01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:38.880]   Is that what you were waiting for?
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:39.960]   Bring it to Gazelle.
[01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:41.760]   You get a quote that's good for 30 days.
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:43.960]   It gives you time to buy the next thing.
[01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:45.440]   Get the data off of the old thing.
[01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:46.800]   Put it on the new thing.
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:48.080]   And then ship it off to Gazelle.
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:49.960]   They pay shipping on anything worth more than a buck.
[01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:52.320]   So it might as well just pile stuff into that box.
[01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:53.840]   Just get a ton of stuff.
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:55.480]   They'll recycle gadgets too for you.
[01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:57.960]   So you don't have to-- if it's something
[01:07:57.960 --> 01:07:59.280]   you can't get any money for, but you
[01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:01.360]   do want to have it sensibly and responsibly,
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:03.240]   Gazelle will do that for you.
[01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:06.160]   They even buy broken iPhones and iPads.
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:09.480]   Then, by the way, if you want to buy-- let's say you break
[01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:11.840]   something and you want to get a new one-- they also sell
[01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:14.640]   the best quality stuff they get back.
[01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:15.640]   They have two conditions.
[01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:16.680]   One certified like new.
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:20.000]   Those are basically new devices, barely used.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.040]   And then certified good.
[01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:24.440]   They might be some gentle signs of wear.
[01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:26.560]   But in both cases, fully functional.
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:29.680]   In fact, all devices have been put through a rigorous 30 point
[01:08:29.680 --> 01:08:31.720]   inspection to make sure they do everything they're supposed
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:32.320]   to do.
[01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:35.440]   And of course, certified pre-owned devices from Gazelle
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:37.960]   are backed by a 30-day risk-free return policy.
[01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:43.000]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E to buy or to sell.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.360]   You got to go to Gazelle.
[01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:47.240]   Gazelle.com.
[01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:50.520]   That's where we sell our old gadgets.
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:52.840]   The pace of a gadget is accelerating.
[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:55.840]   Do you hear the new G4, new phone next week?
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:57.840]   I mean, it just is moving so fast.
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:08:59.280]   In some ways, I feel like Apple's
[01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:00.440]   at a little bit of a disadvantage.
[01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:03.360]   They can only iterate once a year on this stuff.
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:05.960]   And some of these Android devices every few months,
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:07.240]   there's something new.
[01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:09.400]   Yeah, but I mean, the thing is that at least with Apple
[01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:12.120]   know that if they put out a new phone, a certain percentage
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:14.240]   of the customer base will always
[01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:14.740]   buy it.
[01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:15.960]   You've got spikes in it.
[01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:16.800]   They'd still buy it.
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:18.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:19.840]   Yup.
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:23.680]   Google announced this week Project Fi--
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:24.920]   I hope I'm saying that right.
[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:26.760]   I guess it's like the Fi and Wi-Fi.
[01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:28.960]   I'm hoping so, yes, because that's how I've been doing it.
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:31.360]   Project Fi would be kind of funny.
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:33.320]   Fi just sounds a little fey, you know?
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:34.600]   Fes fey.
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:36.120]   They're going to be a wireless carrier.
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:38.240]   We knew this was coming, but now the details are off.
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:41.480]   It's not exactly a threat to Verizon or AT&T.
[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:45.040]   First of all, you have to have an Nexus 6 phone.
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:48.160]   And that's a small group of people.
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:49.560]   Yeah, there's not a small phone, though.
[01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:50.600]   I mean, you use it.
[01:09:50.600 --> 01:09:51.800]   That's the 6th century.
[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:52.280]   Yeah.
[01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:55.520]   You've got to have an Nexus 6 phone and really big pockets.
[01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:57.720]   You use a Nexus 6, don't you, Jason Howell?
[01:09:57.720 --> 01:09:59.120]   Close to all about Android?
[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:00.120]   I do indeed.
[01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:01.440]   And producer of this fine show.
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:04.640]   I'm using my second Nexus 6 because I dropped the first one
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:06.800]   because it was so dang large and I didn't have a case on it.
[01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:09.480]   Now I have a case on it and the world is a beautiful place.
[01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:10.880]   I have my Nexus 6.
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:13.880]   I gave-- I stopped using it because it was so big.
[01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:17.640]   But I love it that it's pure, pure, pure, pure Android 5.1.
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:21.160]   I think my criticism with the 6 has been just that it's big
[01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:23.680]   and that's nice, but it's kind of big without a reason for being--
[01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:25.040]   With even features, yeah.
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:25.720]   Big.
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:26.800]   It's just big for big things.
[01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:27.920]   It's not a great screen.
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:28.920]   It's an OK screen.
[01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:30.040]   It's not a great camera.
[01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:31.640]   It's an OK camera.
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:32.960]   I really like the S6.
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:33.440]   I really do.
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:35.120]   The S6 Edge, the Galaxy.
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:36.160]   And you're using that right now.
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:38.160]   Are you going to review that on before you buy?
[01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:40.120]   Yeah, and actually you got my review in the can at this--
[01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:41.600]   The Edgeless version.
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:42.560]   Yeah, I liked it a lot.
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:44.040]   The camera is phenomenal.
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:46.760]   Oh, man, that camera blows me away.
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:49.440]   On the other hand, you won't be able to use it with Project 5.5.
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:51.680]   Fifi.
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:53.040]   Now, so let me give you the details.
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:55.960]   Then we could talk about why is Google doing this.
[01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:59.040]   So it is $20 a month.
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:01.440]   No contract, sell contract.
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:04.240]   They use Sprint and T-Mobile.
[01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:08.360]   They're going to be a reseller, an MVNO of Sprint and T-Mobile.
[01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:09.320]   That's kind of interesting.
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:12.600]   You'll get a Project 5 SIM to put in your Nexus 6, which
[01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:15.600]   will automatically switch to the best signal.
[01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:18.240]   Throw in Wi-Fi into that mix, because it will use Wi-Fi
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:21.840]   calling as well if you have a good Wi-Fi signal.
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:27.800]   So presumably Google can charge you $20 for unlimited text,
[01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:28.760]   unlimited calls.
[01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:31.960]   By the way, unlimited international texting, too, which I like.
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:34.760]   I guess that's probably something they get with the T-Mobile
[01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:35.280]   relationships.
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:36.880]   Yeah, because I'm on T-Mobile at the moment,
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:37.800]   and they're very good on there.
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:39.080]   You get free international data.
[01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:42.640]   So every time I go home back to the UK, it's just like--
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:44.480]   It's too G, right?
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:45.240]   It's pretty slow.
[01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:46.920]   Two and a half GGPRS.
[01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:47.760]   Yeah.
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:48.760]   But it's something.
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:49.080]   Yeah.
[01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:53.440]   I mean, trust me, someone who used to regularly get stuck
[01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:57.720]   with data-rowing charges, those prices were insane.
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:11:59.800]   I don't have to halt myself on the street just to pay them off.
[01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:01.560]   But I mean, it's just--
[01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:02.840]   It was something like this.
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:04.600]   I think it could be very interesting.
[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:06.800]   They're not going to get the big players to play along.
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:07.680]   No.
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:09.560]   It's an interesting opportunity for sprinting T-Mobile
[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:12.080]   to actually get themselves out there a bit more as well.
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:14.600]   They're also separating out the data completely.
[01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:16.360]   So that's $20 a month.
[01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:17.880]   Then you buy data.
[01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:20.520]   And it's kind of like our old sponsored TING,
[01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:23.120]   where ahead of time, you guess how much data you're
[01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:27.000]   going to use, 10, 20, whatever, 5, 3.
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.560]   And you buy that.
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:31.320]   But they rebate you what you don't use.
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:35.640]   And it's a flat $10 a gigabyte for one gigabyte or for 20 gigabytes.
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:38.080]   It's $10 a gigabyte.
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:42.280]   I didn't see-- maybe you guys saw anything about overages.
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:46.800]   So you say, I'm going to use, let's say, 5 gigs a month, $50.
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:50.520]   So that'll be $70 for the total package plus taxes.
[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:52.880]   If you use 6 or 7 gigabytes, they just
[01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:54.680]   charge you an extra $10.
[01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:56.840]   I assume it just bumps you up to the next tier.
[01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:58.520]   Yeah, that was what I was assuming.
[01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:01.560]   But again, I haven't asked about that either.
[01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:03.440]   But I do think-- go ahead, Leah.
[01:13:03.440 --> 01:13:04.800]   Well, I just think it's a good deal
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:06.960]   because you only pay for what you use.
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:08.000]   Yeah, which is cool.
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.520]   And that's probably where this is all headed, ultimately.
[01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:13.840]   I mean, this has kind of been where things are headed.
[01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:15.320]   The thing that I wonder about this
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:18.720]   is most of the people that I know that have the Nexus 6,
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:22.000]   including my colleague, Build That Wilder, has one and likes it.
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:22.760]   And it's big.
[01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:24.120]   It is big.
[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:26.160]   It's a cool device.
[01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:29.360]   I do like how native Android it is.
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:33.200]   I wish the S6 was more native in the same way.
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:36.760]   But it's closer than previous Samsung devices.
[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:41.680]   But the people who I know who have the S6 are powered users.
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:44.480]   They're all power users, everybody that I know that has it.
[01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:46.400]   And so they're going to be using a lot of data.
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:49.720]   And so typically, it used to be you never use much data
[01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:53.720]   with an unlimited plan, or even if you had five gigs or whatever.
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:57.960]   But now, with Spotify, with YouTube, with just web video
[01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:01.120]   in general, I know a lot of people
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:06.120]   that are using three, four, five megs a month,
[01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:08.440]   gigs a month, sorry.
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:11.920]   Sure, if you watch Netflix or even YouTube, you can easily--
[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:12.440]   Exactly.
[01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:13.440]   --wile to that.
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:15.640]   Super quick, quickly.
[01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:17.120]   And so--
[01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:20.840]   They don't count your Wi-Fi usage against your gigs.
[01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:21.520]   I would hold--
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:22.120]   Yeah, they don't.
[01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:22.720]   OK.
[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:23.220]   Right.
[01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:25.680]   And you can even use the Wi-Fi for cooling as well.
[01:14:25.680 --> 01:14:26.200]   Which I love.
[01:14:26.200 --> 01:14:28.400]   I actually could do that on my S6 Edge.
[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:30.200]   And it works pretty well.
[01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:33.760]   Did you try that, Jason, using Wi-Fi calling?
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:35.360]   You have to have T-Mobile for that to work.
[01:14:35.360 --> 01:14:36.360]   You may not have a T-Mobile phone phone.
[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:37.280]   No, I didn't have a T-Mobile phone.
[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:37.800]   OK.
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:40.440]   So on my T-Mobile S6, works great.
[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:41.160]   And it's seamless.
[01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:45.200]   You leave the house if hands off to the cellular network.
[01:14:45.200 --> 01:14:46.840]   Yeah, the handoff is really nice.
[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:49.120]   You know, T-Mobile's been doing Wi-Fi calling for, gosh,
[01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:52.160]   you know, a decade now, or close to it.
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:53.880]   And it's gotten much better, by the way.
[01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:54.600]   It's gotten much better.
[01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:55.120]   Yeah.
[01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:56.000]   You know, I remember back--
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.280]   I had a Blackberry, a Curvity, a 12-hour Wi-Fi.
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:00.880]   But even then, it was not terrible.
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:01.240]   Yes.
[01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:01.920]   It was gotten really good.
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:03.400]   Yeah, the 8320--
[01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:04.240]   very Blackberry.
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:04.440]   Great.
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:07.040]   Oh, those were the days, my friends.
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:08.040]   It was a day.
[01:15:08.040 --> 01:15:09.280]   It was about 8320.
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:13.120]   Wouldn't it be funny if Google Fi were available on a Blackberry
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:16.360]   8320 and a Nexus 6?
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:18.600]   I would honestly, if that was the case.
[01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:21.840]   Because I've been toying with the idea of buying an old Palm
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:22.840]   trio.
[01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:23.360]   What?
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:25.040]   Now just get the new classic.
[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:25.960]   It's brand new.
[01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:27.480]   No, but I want a Palm trio.
[01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:28.120]   I don't want a Blackberry.
[01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:29.080]   I want a Palm trio.
[01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:31.720]   And I was playing with the idea of trying to see if I can use
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:32.960]   a phone for things that we can't--
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:33.960]   No, you can't.
[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:34.960]   They're having a lot.
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:34.960]   We have one.
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:36.920]   You can borrow ours and see if it works.
[01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:38.880]   Yeah, I can see if I could try to get it on somebody's--
[01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:39.640]   I could see it's analog.
[01:15:39.640 --> 01:15:41.720]   I don't think it's--
[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:44.880]   The 755P, I might be able to get to work.
[01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:45.840]   I don't know.
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:48.160]   I have to look into it.
[01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:49.160]   But I have these ideas.
[01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:50.120]   You're crazy.
[01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:52.120]   You're crazy.
[01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:53.120]   That's fun.
[01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:53.920]   That's fun.
[01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:54.920]   Yeah.
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:56.920]   You know, the funny thing is Apple
[01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:59.320]   get doing this too, MVNO.
[01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:01.920]   I think especially when they're having all that challenge
[01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:05.000]   with AT&T when they were exclusive on AT&T
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:06.480]   for those for a few years.
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:08.520]   And they kind of decided, you know,
[01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:09.880]   we're just not in the wireless business.
[01:16:09.880 --> 01:16:11.360]   We don't want to do that.
[01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:14.040]   But Google-- I think Google is getting better at all
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:18.080]   of the kinds of things that, in terms
[01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:19.720]   of being an internet provider.
[01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:21.480]   I do think that long-term--
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:23.720]   this is another one we've written a long-form article
[01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:26.440]   on a tech republic about Google fiber.
[01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:30.000]   You know, our conclusion is that they're in this for the long haul.
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.040]   They are trying to change the carrier arrangement.
[01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:33.680]   But they could make money that we think
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:35.240]   that they are making money on this.
[01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:37.320]   And they will make money on this.
[01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:39.240]   And that they're serious about it.
[01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:40.760]   And it's something that they're good at, right?
[01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:42.920]   And they know that it increases their bottom line.
[01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:44.840]   The more people use internet.
[01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:46.640]   And obviously, they're sending up balloons now
[01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:49.120]   and doing, you know, Wi-Fi via drones
[01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:50.760]   and all kinds of crazy stuff.
[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:53.000]   I mean, I think that they are in the internet business
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:53.960]   for the long haul.
[01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:55.480]   And so it completely makes sense for them
[01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:57.760]   to become an MVNO and get their feet wet
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:01.240]   and figure out what it looks like to try to be a wireless carrier,
[01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:07.120]   or at least, you know, a middleman that's pedaling wireless networking.
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:11.200]   But who's to say that they don't buy T-Mobile?
[01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:14.240]   That they don't start buying up wireless carriers?
[01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:16.760]   Would not surprise me at all.
[01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:18.760]   I think that might turn--
[01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:20.760]   I think that would be a significant challenge
[01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:21.760]   is that they tried to buy--
[01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:23.000]   Giver from the governor.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:24.400]   Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:26.200]   Because to me, the big thing that this is about
[01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:28.600]   and has been about is all about them getting data.
[01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:30.720]   You know, I mean, they can say that it's for other reasons.
[01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:33.520]   But I mean, they want the data because, you know, increasingly,
[01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:35.640]   they're losing people who are going on mobile, right?
[01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:37.560]   I mean, they're earnings.
[01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:38.800]   They're trying to dispel that myth.
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:40.440]   But it's the truth, you know?
[01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:41.600]   Apple's blocking Google.
[01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:45.720]   In fact, if you do a search on the Apple Watch, you get Bing.
[01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:46.720]   Right.
[01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:48.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:50.760]   They can say that they anonymize the data.
[01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:52.680]   They can say that they're not invading your privacy.
[01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:55.200]   And we can kind of get into how paranoid I may or may not
[01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:57.840]   be about the fact that I don't think that I would, under any
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:18:01.560]   circumstances, point Google to be my wireless carrier.
[01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:03.360]   They know enough about me as it is.
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:04.560]   Maybe I'm overly paranoid.
[01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:06.720]   But I do think that by being in the ISP game,
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:09.720]   whether it's through Google Fiber or with a carrier,
[01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:11.640]   you know, they have access to all this information.
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:13.560]   No one knows more about what you do on the internet.
[01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:15.440]   No one than your ISP.
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:17.400]   They see everything you do.
[01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:20.560]   That's why Google wants to be an ISP and will be an ISP.
[01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:21.560]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:22.680]   Oh, long term.
[01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:24.760]   And maybe I'm just an idiot.
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:26.320]   And there are plenty who would agree.
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:28.760]   But I don't care if Google knows ever.
[01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:31.960]   The more Google knows about me, the more useful Google now is.
[01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:35.320]   For instance, well, sorry, you're saying Google now
[01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:36.720]   is useful for something.
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:37.400]   Oh, it is.
[01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:39.640]   If you let it know enough stuff, the cards--
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:44.240]   It tells me my bill is due for American Express tomorrow.
[01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:46.120]   And I mean, it's asking me all sorts of stuff.
[01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:49.120]   It says, I see you're leaving tomorrow on a plane flight
[01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:50.760]   here.
[01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:52.280]   It tells me all sorts-- I love that.
[01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:56.040]   I want it's ex-mashina.
[01:18:56.040 --> 01:19:00.280]   I want the Google bot to know everything about me.
[01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:02.480]   I want to have sex with it.
[01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:03.000]   Wait a minute.
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:03.520]   I'm sorry.
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:04.120]   I lost my head.
[01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:05.280]   Wow, there's a mental image.
[01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:07.800]   It's just going to link up, right?
[01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:10.320]   Isn't that what happens in ex-mashina?
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:12.280]   It says graphic nudity.
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:12.680]   I don't know.
[01:19:12.680 --> 01:19:15.200]   I think Google know an awful lot about us already as it is.
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:16.920]   And they will know more if they're an ISP.
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:18.880]   But from a purely selfish point of view,
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:22.240]   I really like this to succeed because I'm just sick.
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:25.120]   Well, I'm just sick of seeing how badly people over here
[01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:27.520]   get done over for their mobile contracts for their AS.
[01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:29.560]   You're seeing people over there don't get done over?
[01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:31.200]   Oh, you compare the prices of the US,
[01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:32.560]   the prices in Europe.
[01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:33.920]   You're paying about double what we're--
[01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:34.520]   Really?
[01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:35.520]   Yeah.
[01:19:35.520 --> 01:19:36.680]   They have choices too.
[01:19:36.680 --> 01:19:38.080]   And good, get a good choice.
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:38.840]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:38.840]   I mean--
[01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:39.760]   You actually have good choices.
[01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:42.280]   You've generally got in most places choice
[01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:44.120]   between three or four ISPs.
[01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:46.320]   They're all competing on price, the same with mobile vendors.
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:48.240]   You're thinking the seven in the UK now.
[01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:50.360]   And they're all trying to win to catch each other on price.
[01:19:50.360 --> 01:19:52.560]   I have to say that the project fight does not
[01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:53.920]   sound like it's that good a price.
[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:55.080]   I mean, I use--
[01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:56.600]   I probably do use 5 gigabytes.
[01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:58.400]   So now it's $70 plus taxes.
[01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:00.520]   It's exactly what I pay T-Mobile.
[01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:02.880]   I kind of have a theory about this.
[01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:06.280]   The theory about this is that we aren't going to know anything
[01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:08.640]   until it actually finally rolls out, right?
[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:11.880]   Because if this interconnected web of millions
[01:20:11.880 --> 01:20:15.400]   of Wi-Fi access points actually has the ability
[01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:18.120]   to be blanketed enough in your region,
[01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:19.120]   in your geographical location--
[01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:19.960]   It'll never leave Wi-Fi.
[01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:21.360]   That you're always on it.
[01:20:21.360 --> 01:20:23.600]   Then it doesn't matter how much data you use right now.
[01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:26.400]   It matters how many Wi-Fi access points surround you.
[01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:27.400]   Well, here in Petaluma--
[01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:28.480]   Because if you're hopping on it all the time,
[01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:29.400]   you aren't going to use it.
[01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:31.600]   If you're an Xfinity customer, you pretty much never
[01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:33.080]   have to leave Wi-Fi here in Petaluma.
[01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:35.200]   Because of that thing, Comcast does
[01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:37.200]   where they take over wireless routers
[01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:38.440]   and make them available.
[01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:38.920]   Yeah.
[01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:40.840]   I'm always within reach.
[01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:42.360]   In New York, they've gotten pretty good, too.
[01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:45.080]   Because there's a group between Optum, which
[01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:48.040]   is cable vision, Comcast and Time Warner.
[01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:50.400]   Or basically, all three can kind of roam on one another.
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:51.400]   So it's not everywhere.
[01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:53.120]   But it's a ton of places.
[01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:55.240]   I'm an optimum subscriber.
[01:20:55.240 --> 01:20:56.840]   So I have access in a lot of places.
[01:20:56.840 --> 01:20:57.440]   And they're awesome.
[01:20:57.440 --> 01:21:00.480]   You even need a cellular service.
[01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:01.560]   Yeah, I do.
[01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:03.600]   But depending on what area I was in,
[01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:04.800]   I would necessarily have to.
[01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:07.560]   They also-- cable vision just started this thing,
[01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:10.560]   freewheel, which is a Wi-Fi only phone service.
[01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:15.120]   Which basically, again, I don't think that many people
[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:17.440]   could use it just that.
[01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:19.720]   But it's the price of where it is.
[01:21:19.720 --> 01:21:22.720]   It's getting to that level.
[01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:24.600]   Also, I mean, I think that you look at--
[01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:27.200]   what I think Google Fi is very similar to is things
[01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:29.360]   like Republic Wireless, which is another--
[01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:30.360]   Right.
[01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:31.440]   And I've used Republic Wireless.
[01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:32.800]   It works really, really well.
[01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:33.800]   I use it in the works.
[01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:34.320]   Yeah.
[01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:35.320]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:36.960]   And it's a very similar kind of idea.
[01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:39.840]   So I mean, I think that it's their way of kind of--
[01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:42.800]   like Jason was saying, kind of getting in the door of wanting
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:44.920]   to kind of be this ISP, be this carrier.
[01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:47.080]   If getting all my information is so valuable,
[01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:49.400]   shouldn't I get this service for free?
[01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:51.320]   Really?
[01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:54.200]   Yeah, that's the argument they use with Gmail.
[01:21:54.200 --> 01:21:55.320]   But I think mobile is--
[01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:58.160]   I mean, there's such a lot of money to be made in this.
[01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:00.440]   And I think, to be honest, yeah, if you compare the prices
[01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:02.280]   to what, say, T-Mobile or Sprinter Charging,
[01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:03.720]   it's not that different.
[01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:04.480]   It's the same.
[01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:05.920]   And you compare it to-- and I think the real targets
[01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:07.280]   for this of Verizon 18 and C.
[01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:08.120]   Oh, that's exactly it.
[01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:11.560]   Verizon are charging, say, $10 for $1,000 text messages.
[01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:11.920]   Right.
[01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:13.600]   The data load on that is nothing.
[01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:15.160]   So I mean, it's pure profit.
[01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:17.040]   It goes through-- I mean, that's the dirty little
[01:22:17.040 --> 01:22:18.040]   secret.
[01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:19.040]   SMS is free.
[01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:20.600]   It goes through data signals that are already sent out anyway.
[01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:22.400]   It's like the extra bits.
[01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:25.160]   So the carriers literally pay nothing for SMS.
[01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:25.520]   Exactly.
[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:27.360]   Yet they continue to charge more for it
[01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:28.160]   year after year.
[01:22:28.160 --> 01:22:30.840]   It's the biggest rack in the entire world.
[01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:33.200]   Well, I'm a T-Mobile customer.
[01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:37.880]   I pay $70 a month, unlimited text, unlimited phone,
[01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:39.600]   and unlimited data.
[01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:42.920]   And when they say unlimited, I keep saying really unlimited,
[01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:44.280]   they say, yeah, really unlimited.
[01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:46.480]   I think they actually do slow it down after five people.
[01:22:46.480 --> 01:22:47.480]   It's five gigabytes.
[01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:48.480]   Yeah, right.
[01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:49.480]   And then they throttle.
[01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:49.800]   But it's not--
[01:22:49.800 --> 01:22:51.280]   They've never throttled me.
[01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:54.640]   So I'm getting essentially the same thing, right?
[01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:56.280]   Because I could travel internationally.
[01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:58.480]   I get the 2G, and I go up to 2 and 1/2 G,
[01:22:58.480 --> 01:23:00.320]   and I get the free international text.
[01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:01.640]   So essentially, I'm getting this.
[01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:04.400]   What I'm not getting is sprint.
[01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:05.840]   Right.
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:07.360]   Because I am getting Wi-Fi calling also.
[01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:10.400]   But in T-Mobile's great here, but when I go somewhere
[01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:13.280]   where T-Mobile's not as good, then I
[01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:15.880]   don't have that option of moving over to sprint.
[01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:16.880]   That would be the one--
[01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:18.720]   New York City oo ouch.
[01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:19.480]   Roodle.
[01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:20.560]   What is the best--
[01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:21.360]   It's Verizon, right?
[01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:23.080]   Because that used to be 9x.
[01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:24.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:25.760]   It's Verizon with the bell.
[01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:27.560]   Right.
[01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:29.680]   So is AT&T good in New York?
[01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:30.360]   It is.
[01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:30.800]   It is.
[01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:33.840]   I think Verizon's better and faster, at least in my experience.
[01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:36.680]   But AT&T and Verizon are the two you want sprint and T-Mobile
[01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:37.880]   are both pretty terrible.
[01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:39.280]   Something happened in Petaluma.
[01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:42.080]   Verizon suddenly got terrible here.
[01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:44.240]   Verizon and Sprint are terrible here.
[01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:45.120]   AT&T is OK.
[01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:46.480]   And T-Mobile's amazing.
[01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:49.200]   It's like 96 megabits down, 30 megabits up.
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:50.520]   Oh, V. Wow.
[01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:51.520]   Yeah.
[01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:53.280]   It's amazing.
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:54.320]   That's why I'm a T-Mobile guy.
[01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:55.280]   I'm happy T-Mobile.
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:56.360]   That's fantastic.
[01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:58.080]   I mean, sprints problem is they bet wrong.
[01:23:58.080 --> 01:23:58.760]   And they went with--
[01:23:58.760 --> 01:23:59.280]   They did.
[01:23:59.280 --> 01:23:59.960]   They went Wi-Fi.
[01:23:59.960 --> 01:23:59.960]   Wi-Fi.
[01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:00.480]   Wi-Fi.
[01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:01.000]   Wi-Fi.
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:01.840]   I mean, it's just--
[01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:02.880]   You told me you're thinking.
[01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:05.400]   I know Intel gave me a shed load of money to do it.
[01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:07.040]   But boy, that guy's gone, right?
[01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:09.080]   The CEO did that as gone.
[01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:09.480]   It was a big risk.
[01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:11.120]   All of a sudden that was a mistake.
[01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:11.600]   Yeah.
[01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:12.480]   It was a big risk.
[01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:15.120]   And the thing is, if it would have turned out,
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:16.840]   they would have taken over everything
[01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:18.200]   if it would have worked out for them,
[01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:19.560]   if Wi-Fi X would have worked out.
[01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:22.000]   But the problem was-- it was very--
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.160]   I'm competitive.
[01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:25.000]   The reason it didn't work out, because they still
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.880]   have as much or more spectrum, which spectrum
[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:32.360]   is like the bandwidth, right, of then Verizon.
[01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:34.280]   They have all this 4G spectrum.
[01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:38.160]   But the problem is they had to buy so much of their back
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:40.920]   haul from AT&T and Verizon, right?
[01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:44.240]   And so because of that-- and they didn't not sell it to them,
[01:24:44.240 --> 01:24:47.200]   but they dragged their feet and made it so slow and also
[01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:48.360]   expensive.
[01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:51.600]   And so because of that, YMax did not succeed.
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:53.720]   But YMax was this great idea.
[01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:55.520]   And if it would have worked, it would have been great,
[01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:57.400]   because they were talking about, look,
[01:24:57.400 --> 01:24:59.200]   we're going to-- for 30 bucks a month,
[01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:02.840]   your whole family can have this 4G connection.
[01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:06.480]   And we'll just pay you-- they were going to pay you per gig
[01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:07.160]   or whatever.
[01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:09.400]   But they were going to charge you per gig.
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:11.680]   But it was going to be-- and they even said,
[01:25:11.680 --> 01:25:14.280]   I asked the CEO at the time, I was like, you're just
[01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:15.400]   going to be a dumb pipe.
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:16.240]   And he's like, you know what?
[01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:17.920]   If we're a dumb pipe and everybody's on this
[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:19.920]   and we're making lots of money, I don't care.
[01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:22.880]   And he said, but we just want to bring fast internet
[01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:26.040]   and spread it around and make it and stop
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:30.400]   the carriers from gouging you.
[01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:34.080]   And it was very altruistic, and it ultimately didn't succeed.
[01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:35.120]   But they had the right idea.
[01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:39.520]   But now they still are sitting on all of this spectrum.
[01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:40.800]   Wait a minute, my watch is ringing.
[01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:43.760]   I'm going to have to hold on anything with him.
[01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:44.920]   Stop the show.
[01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:48.800]   I'm going to show you how I can use the watch to answer a call
[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:49.520]   here.
[01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:52.600]   Hi Abby, are you there?
[01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:56.560]   Oh, she hung up.
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:25:58.080]   You can't actually make a call on a watch.
[01:25:58.080 --> 01:25:59.560]   She's like, you're doing a show, aren't you?
[01:25:59.560 --> 01:26:00.520]   She can tell.
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:02.880]   Because she said, Daddy, that's your announcer voice.
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:04.120]   I said, I'm not going to talk to you.
[01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:05.880]   Bye bye.
[01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:07.760]   So look at this now, see Christina.
[01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:08.920]   Look at this.
[01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:12.360]   $350 for a BlackBerry Classic, brand new factory
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:12.680]   unlocked.
[01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:14.800]   $350.
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:15.360]   Yeah, I know.
[01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:17.320]   But who wants a new BlackBerry?
[01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:19.840]   If I'm going to get a BlackBerry, I want one of the old ones.
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:22.200]   Why don't you want BlackBerry's 10 or whatever
[01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:24.720]   the new operating system is and all that fun?
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:26.360]   Have you ever actually used BlackBerry, Tim?
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:27.320]   No.
[01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:28.680]   Yeah, so no, you don't.
[01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:31.200]   But you can run Android apps.
[01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:33.040]   Yeah, poorly.
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:35.680]   And on the square screen, if I want to want Android apps,
[01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:37.080]   what would I just get an Android phone?
[01:26:37.080 --> 01:26:38.680]   Oh, yeah, that's a good one.
[01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:40.400]   I mean, what advantage does BlackBerry
[01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:43.840]   give me other than a square screen, which is weird for apps
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:45.360]   and a keyboard?
[01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:49.000]   And for some reason, a trackpad, because it is 2015,
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:50.320]   and that is what we need.
[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:51.920]   I am so tempted to buy this.
[01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:54.840]   I have been-- ever since the BlackBerry released this,
[01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:57.280]   just because it'd be cool to pull it out and see the ones.
[01:26:57.280 --> 01:26:58.880]   It would be-- for me, I almost--
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:02.320]   I want to go back to the bold 9900 or something.
[01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:05.480]   But it's, I thought, was really going to go like retro on it.
[01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:07.240]   But yeah, I mean, there is something--
[01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:10.040]   I did actually toy with the idea of maybe getting one
[01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:12.400]   just for jokes because I thought it would--
[01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:14.200]   like you, I think it would be hilarious to just pull it up.
[01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:15.520]   I'll be like, hold on.
[01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:18.520]   Let me check on my BlackBerry, guys, because it's 2008.
[01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:20.600]   And then you say things like, don't laugh.
[01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:23.240]   This is the best keyboard ever made.
[01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:23.760]   Right.
[01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:24.960]   And then you realize-- and then I realized
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:28.880]   I've spent eight years typing on a glass screen.
[01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:31.640]   And that I no longer can type on the clickity
[01:27:31.640 --> 01:27:33.560]   keys anymore because I'm used to--
[01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:35.040]   I don't even know how it works.
[01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:35.400]   Yeah.
[01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:37.160]   Exactly.
[01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:38.440]   Yeah, that big--
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:39.360]   Wear BlackBerry.
[01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:41.120]   I can't-- all of a sudden, I'm forgetting any of it.
[01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:42.080]   There's the passport.
[01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:42.720]   The big square.
[01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:43.560]   Yeah, it was weird.
[01:27:43.560 --> 01:27:45.000]   Like, what a reaction.
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:45.680]   Wear that one.
[01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:46.200]   Yeah.
[01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:46.960]   Or use that one.
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:48.160]   Because, oh my gosh.
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:51.840]   So my colleague Steve Ranger in the UK
[01:27:51.840 --> 01:27:53.680]   has been carrying this thing around.
[01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:57.280]   And every time he pulls that thing out, you just go, oh my god.
[01:27:57.280 --> 01:27:58.360]   What is that?
[01:27:58.360 --> 01:27:59.240]   It is huge.
[01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:01.200]   And like, hold that thing up to your head
[01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:02.400]   when you have a phone call.
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:03.440]   Oh, man.
[01:28:03.440 --> 01:28:05.120]   It's glorious.
[01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:06.120]   Steve actually used to be--
[01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:08.520]   Steve actually used to be my boss.
[01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:10.720]   And that sounds exactly like you, to be honest.
[01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:13.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:13.640]   Yes.
[01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:14.160]   Love Steve.
[01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:15.080]   Steve's amazing.
[01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:16.600]   He's just been using it temporarily.
[01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:18.080]   It's not his phone.
[01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:19.880]   But he kind of likes it.
[01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:21.200]   There's some things he likes about it.
[01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:24.160]   But part of it, I think, is the shock value of it.
[01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:24.720]   You know?
[01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:25.160]   It's fun.
[01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:25.560]   Steve, exactly.
[01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:27.040]   You're pulling out this bizarre--
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:29.120]   you know, this passport-sized device.
[01:28:29.120 --> 01:28:30.200]   Oh, no, wait.
[01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:30.720]   Yeah.
[01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:31.320]   There's more.
[01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:34.280]   And then can you-- the keyboard acts as like a touchscreen
[01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:35.560]   or something like that.
[01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:36.840]   Acts is like a trackpad.
[01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:38.320]   It's a bizarre device.
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:38.720]   Is it so bizarre?
[01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:39.800]   He is BlackBerry.
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:40.320]   It's so bizarre.
[01:28:40.320 --> 01:28:41.560]   They own QNX.
[01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:44.720]   QNX is a real-time operating system.
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:46.480]   A lot of car manufacturers are turning to it.
[01:28:46.480 --> 01:28:47.720]   Every car manufacturer, basically.
[01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:48.440]   Yeah.
[01:28:48.440 --> 01:28:51.360]   So that might-- so BlackBerry is not doomed.
[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:54.360]   They have a chance to succeed just with QNX, right?
[01:28:54.360 --> 01:28:55.040]   Well, yeah.
[01:28:55.040 --> 01:28:56.400]   But they're doomed in hardware, I think.
[01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:57.680]   I mean, I think that's huge.
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:28:58.680]   For phones.
[01:28:58.680 --> 01:29:01.080]   They sold like a million and a half phones
[01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:01.800]   or something.
[01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:02.960]   Last quarter, which--
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:05.560]   God, I'd be happy to sell you a million and a half anything.
[01:29:05.560 --> 01:29:08.440]   I'd be so happy if we sold a million and a half anything.
[01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:09.280]   Yeah, no.
[01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:11.280]   I mean, honestly, the size of the smartphone market,
[01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:13.480]   if you're selling that few phones, that's terrible.
[01:29:13.480 --> 01:29:16.200]   Those are like, I think that like WebOS sold-- well,
[01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:18.360]   OK, well, WebOS probably sold less than that.
[01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:20.800]   But that's probably the last time we had anybody
[01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:22.160]   sell anything that poorly.
[01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:24.120]   I mean, I think they could work as far as the software
[01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:25.160]   company goes.
[01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:27.480]   They're really going into MDM.
[01:29:27.480 --> 01:29:30.200]   But I mean, they bought QNX from Harmon.
[01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:33.200]   And I mean, that makes a nice side business.
[01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:35.080]   But they've got to do kind of the licensing terms.
[01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:36.000]   But I don't know.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:37.840]   I mean, I think they can totally survive as a software
[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:38.160]   company.
[01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:40.560]   I just think that personally, I think their days as a hardware
[01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:42.440]   company are basically over.
[01:29:42.440 --> 01:29:42.840]   Yeah.
[01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:46.200]   I mean, it's a crying shame, in a way, because basically,
[01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:48.160]   they made the smartphone essential.
[01:29:48.160 --> 01:29:50.360]   Apple made it like a bit, but BlackBerry made it actually
[01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:52.400]   essential to have one of these things on you.
[01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:55.520]   And then they just completely misunderstood the market.
[01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:56.520]   They misunderstood the market.
[01:29:56.520 --> 01:30:00.040]   And they basically sat on their hands for years.
[01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:01.600]   I mean, that's part of it too.
[01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:03.720]   They literally-- I mean, Palm kind of did the same thing.
[01:30:03.720 --> 01:30:06.560]   But Palm had a bunch of other things going on behind the scenes.
[01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:08.080]   They at least tried to pivot.
[01:30:08.080 --> 01:30:11.840]   BlackBerry, I mean, it took them how many years to get BB10
[01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:12.480]   out the door.
[01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:14.800]   And then even then, they still misjudged what was happening.
[01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:15.680]   But you're absolutely right.
[01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:17.120]   And they made it essential.
[01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:19.240]   And then they lost the script completely.
[01:30:19.240 --> 01:30:20.680]   And it's sad.
[01:30:20.680 --> 01:30:21.040]   Yeah.
[01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:24.680]   I remember being in press conferences in 2007, 2008,
[01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:28.560]   when both Microsoft and BlackBerry like mocked the iPhone.
[01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:33.560]   I mean, they loved to mock the iPhone and laughed it off.
[01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:36.320]   And they said, this device is worthless.
[01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:40.040]   It's not something to worry about.
[01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:43.160]   This is all marketing and buzz.
[01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:44.520]   And it doesn't matter.
[01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:47.160]   And they both paid a price for it.
[01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:49.960]   I got blacklisted by BlackBerry for a good year and a half,
[01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:52.440]   because in 2009, they were running some sort of--
[01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:54.240]   somebody was doing some sort of BlackBerry million
[01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:56.440]   dollar app fund or billion dollar app fund or some
[01:30:56.440 --> 01:30:57.240]   ridiculous thing.
[01:30:57.240 --> 01:30:58.920]   And I was on the phone with somebody--
[01:30:58.920 --> 01:31:01.480]   I was working at download squad at the time, RIP.
[01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:03.560]   And I was interviewing somebody from BlackBerry
[01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:05.640]   and somebody from this fund and talking about apps.
[01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:06.440]   And I was like, OK.
[01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:08.720]   So at the time, I was a BlackBerry user,
[01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:10.520]   but I had an iPod touch.
[01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:13.800]   And I was knowing I was going to move to an iPhone,
[01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:15.560]   because I was so frustrated with my BlackBerry.
[01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:18.760]   But I was like, OK, so this is great
[01:31:18.760 --> 01:31:19.560]   that you've got these apps.
[01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:21.920]   Well, when are your apps not going to suck anymore?
[01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:24.920]   And they got so offended that I would dare say that their app
[01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:27.000]   situation was dire in 2009.
[01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:27.960]   And I was like--
[01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:29.600]   I was like-- but you guys understand, right?
[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:31.400]   But your apps are really bad.
[01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:34.840]   Like they are nowhere near as good as what Apple has.
[01:31:34.840 --> 01:31:37.000]   And even what Android is doing.
[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.720]   And they got so mad and so offended
[01:31:38.720 --> 01:31:41.560]   I was blacklisted for like a year and a half, which I--
[01:31:41.560 --> 01:31:42.040]   Really?
[01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:42.520]   --is not actually hilarious.
[01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:45.120]   Yeah, like the Google Blacklist completely cut off.
[01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:45.960]   And I thought it was funny.
[01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:48.800]   I was like, you know, I got off the phone
[01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:50.320]   and I turned to my now husband.
[01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:52.760]   I was like, well, that was the worst interview phone
[01:31:52.760 --> 01:31:54.520]   interview I've ever done in my life.
[01:31:54.520 --> 01:31:55.800]   Because they were so--
[01:31:55.800 --> 01:31:57.760]   like they were like not happy at all.
[01:31:57.760 --> 01:32:01.280]   But I mean, but frankly, I mean, we could all see it then.
[01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:04.000]   And this is when they were selling tens of millions
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.160]   of phones a quarter.
[01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:06.360]   You know, they were number one.
[01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:07.920]   They were out selling the iPhone.
[01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:09.800]   But they didn't have any app strategy.
[01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:11.040]   They were crushing it.
[01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:12.600]   And I was like, well, OK, well, when
[01:32:12.600 --> 01:32:14.040]   are you going to make your apps not suck?
[01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:14.880]   Oh, our apps are great.
[01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:16.320]   We've got the best app catalog out there.
[01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:17.160]   Duh, du, du, du, du, du.
[01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:19.160]   Like, no, no, you don't.
[01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:22.520]   And that was when I first went, ooh, something is wrong here.
[01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:23.960]   Something that is not small right.
[01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:25.720]   And unless they can face reality,
[01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:27.400]   they are going to have problems.
[01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:28.440]   And sure enough, they did.
[01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:30.760]   You know, the playbook, the whole-- we can't even--
[01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:32.480]   I mean, that's a whole other saga.
[01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:34.040]   Their ridiculous tablet strategy.
[01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:35.360]   But yeah.
[01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:37.880]   I think every journalist has got at least one playbook hidden
[01:32:37.880 --> 01:32:40.160]   away in the cupboard of debt technology that they--
[01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:40.680]   Oh, really?
[01:32:40.680 --> 01:32:42.320]   --because they push those out to everyone.
[01:32:42.320 --> 01:32:42.920]   But Black Remake--
[01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:43.920]   Oh, yeah.
[01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:46.720]   Black Remake exactly the same mistake Nokia made.
[01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:48.480]   They got themselves into a really good position
[01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:49.720]   in the mobile market.
[01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:51.880]   And then they just took their eye off the ball completely
[01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:53.440]   and said, this is going to carry on for at least
[01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:54.800]   in the cupboard another couple of years.
[01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:55.400]   Nothing does.
[01:32:55.400 --> 01:32:56.360]   We don't need to do anything.
[01:32:56.360 --> 01:32:57.600]   These upstarts will just--
[01:32:57.600 --> 01:33:00.120]   You know who's in that boat right now, HTC?
[01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:00.560]   Yeah.
[01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:02.960]   Yeah, HTC got a lot too close to Microsoft.
[01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:05.560]   And they're paying the penalty for that.
[01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:08.800]   I feel bad for him because I loved the HTC One.
[01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:11.560]   But this is the third year running, kids.
[01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:14.240]   Maybe it's time to update that design a little bit.
[01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:17.040]   You know when you've really made it when there's a map
[01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:21.320]   in Pakistan of an Android robot peeing on you.
[01:33:21.320 --> 01:33:22.680]   That's going to use the word micturate.
[01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:24.440]   But it's got to be going low class.
[01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:25.960]   Yes, micturating.
[01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:27.240]   I like that.
[01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:30.560]   I just checked my Google Maps and it's gone.
[01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:32.440]   They fixed it.
[01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:36.120]   But apparently somebody was able to use the map maker tool
[01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:37.960]   and sneak this by Google.
[01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:42.480]   Because Google, they said, would never do anything like this.
[01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:44.120]   They were using the parks tool or something like that.
[01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:44.960]   They were making it like a park.
[01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:46.440]   Oh, they made a park.
[01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:47.040]   Exactly.
[01:33:47.040 --> 01:33:51.120]   They kept adding the coordinates to basically make
[01:33:51.120 --> 01:33:53.640]   this fantastic symbol, which I think
[01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:56.360]   that the fact that somebody actually mapped this out
[01:33:56.360 --> 01:33:59.280]   and put the coordinates together is pretty genius
[01:33:59.280 --> 01:33:59.960]   and pretty hilarious.
[01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:01.760]   That's better than crop circles.
[01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:04.240]   Apparently they submitted it in pieces.
[01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:08.480]   So nobody at Google got wise to it.
[01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:10.400]   So it's a really small bit.
[01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:12.440]   They increased the stream bit by bit.
[01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:12.840]   Wait a minute.
[01:34:12.840 --> 01:34:13.560]   What's that?
[01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:15.360]   There's a happy face?
[01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:17.440]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:20.040]   Google review policy is crap.
[01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:20.880]   That's a good one.
[01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:24.600]   Thanks to Team Android for finding that one as well.
[01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:25.760]   Is that real?
[01:34:25.760 --> 01:34:28.360]   No.
[01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:30.680]   The vast majority of users who edit our maps
[01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:33.680]   provide great contributions, says Google, such as mapping
[01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:36.440]   places that have never been mapped before or adding
[01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:38.560]   new business openings or address changes.
[01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:42.840]   We're sorry for this inappropriate user-created content.
[01:34:42.840 --> 01:34:45.360]   We're working to remove it quickly, and now they have.
[01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:46.560]   Is this a joke?
[01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:47.040]   I think it's a joke.
[01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:48.240]   It reminds me of Scrooge.
[01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:51.360]   The movie Scrooge when Bill Murray is talking about how
[01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:55.640]   happy is that basically someone has died watching their ad.
[01:34:55.640 --> 01:34:57.480]   And then they say something on the--
[01:34:57.480 --> 01:34:59.560]   they say something on the-- and he picks up the phone
[01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:02.080]   and goes, we at IVC are shot in a Paul's--
[01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:02.080]   Shot.
[01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:03.040]   --and it was shocked.
[01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:04.040]   It was shocked.
[01:35:04.040 --> 01:35:05.880]   I tell you, shocked.
[01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:08.160]   There's gambling going on.
[01:35:08.160 --> 01:35:10.000]   In a way, it's kind of a compliment to Apple, though,
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:11.720]   because you notice Windows Phone logos weren't--
[01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:12.240]   Oh, yeah.
[01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:12.740]   --the level.
[01:35:12.740 --> 01:35:13.760]   Oh, that's what I'm saying.
[01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:15.120]   Blackberry would have been thrilled to be
[01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:16.120]   dictated upon.
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:16.620]   Oh, yeah.
[01:35:16.620 --> 01:35:17.120]   Yes.
[01:35:17.120 --> 01:35:18.120]   Oh, yeah, they wish.
[01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:18.960]   You could have been like--
[01:35:18.960 --> 01:35:20.720]   Please, Android Robot.
[01:35:20.720 --> 01:35:22.200]   Please, please notice us now.
[01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:23.640]   --micturate on me.
[01:35:23.640 --> 01:35:25.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:35:25.640 --> 01:35:28.640]   Google Glass is not dead.
[01:35:28.640 --> 01:35:30.520]   Right.
[01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:33.640]   The Wall Street Journal says that LaXodica, which basically
[01:35:33.640 --> 01:35:37.560]   has a monopoly on all God glasses made in the entire world,
[01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:39.560]   is working on a new version of Google Glass.
[01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:42.320]   What could they do to Google Glass?
[01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:43.760]   They could sell it.
[01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:46.960]   Well, simply, they own Sunglass Hut, a whole bunch of others.
[01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:47.880]   Yeah, they own everybody.
[01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:48.400]   And there.
[01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:49.240]   Yeah, they know everybody.
[01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:50.600]   But above all, they could make it look stylish,
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:53.920]   because Google Glass version 1.0 just looked like an
[01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:56.920]   engineered, cobbled it together out of bits.
[01:35:56.920 --> 01:35:59.640]   If they can actually build it unobtrusively or relatively
[01:35:59.640 --> 01:36:03.440]   unobtrusively into a pair of stylish glasses, then it might,
[01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:06.720]   just might take off a little better than it has so far.
[01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:09.800]   But there's still a hell of a work that needs to be done on it.
[01:36:09.800 --> 01:36:14.240]   LaXodica actually had its general meeting in Milan this week,
[01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:17.440]   and the chief executive said, yes, we are working on Google
[01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:19.080]   Glass 2.0.
[01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:22.160]   Can't be 1,500 bucks, although LaXodica is known for really
[01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:25.720]   overcharging for this plastic on your head.
[01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:28.160]   Yeah, the price of oak leaves is pretty positive that you can
[01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:30.520]   take a few bits of plastic, stick them together, and put them
[01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:31.880]   on its branding on it.
[01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:33.640]   Braebans, too.
[01:36:33.640 --> 01:36:34.120]   Yeah.
[01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:35.440]   They own all of those.
[01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:38.640]   All of them, the Armani-- they do Armani's, I think.
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:40.800]   They do, and Clines.
[01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:44.120]   They do Michael Kors.
[01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:45.680]   They made licenses for everybody, I think.
[01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:47.880]   It was a great 60 minutes piece on them a few months ago,
[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:49.320]   and it's really kind of an amazing story.
[01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:51.720]   They were just this little Italian eyeglass company,
[01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:53.800]   and they just started acquiring.
[01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:56.080]   Before anybody noticed, pretty much they owned everybody,
[01:36:56.080 --> 01:37:00.880]   from lens crafters to vision centers to manufacturers,
[01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:01.560]   and that was it.
[01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:04.480]   I think they're getting into the technology.
[01:37:04.480 --> 01:37:06.840]   The same meeting you also announced a deal with Intel,
[01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:10.520]   when they were getting products coming out in February or March.
[01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:13.600]   And I think they've probably realized that design-wise glasses
[01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:15.320]   haven't changed that much in the last time--
[01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:16.800]   It's got to be somewhere we can go here.
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:18.960]   Yeah, there's got to be an angle, some way we get a tech
[01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:19.760]   focus in there.
[01:37:19.760 --> 01:37:21.080]   And Google is desperate for somebody
[01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:23.480]   to take glass on and make it popular.
[01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:24.000]   Yeah.
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:24.560]   You know what I wonder?
[01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:26.840]   I wonder if they're going after Microsoft's hollow lens.
[01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:29.600]   Somebody's going to make those, and that is going to be a product.
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:30.440]   That's so cool.
[01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:31.040]   Yes.
[01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:33.120]   That is-- they're on the right track there, right?
[01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:37.600]   Because it's true augmented reality in a very, very cool sense.
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:40.600]   And so I think that-- I think we're on the right track.
[01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:43.240]   It has to be three or four hundred bucks.
[01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:45.600]   It has to look better and be more integrated
[01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:48.040]   into what looks like a normal pair of glasses.
[01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:49.960]   And then they have to take the technology more
[01:37:49.960 --> 01:37:52.480]   in the direction of Microsoft's hollow lens, which I think
[01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:54.240]   is much more on the right track of something
[01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:57.680]   that could be useful than what glass was.
[01:37:57.680 --> 01:37:59.880]   I think Microsoft's hollow lens is more
[01:37:59.880 --> 01:38:03.080]   like the promise of what glass could be than what glass was,
[01:38:03.080 --> 01:38:04.040]   ultimately.
[01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:06.680]   Yeah, I was blown away by hollow lens when I used it.
[01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:07.840]   Oh, you got to use it up there?
[01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:08.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:10.200]   I went up to Windows 10 preview.
[01:38:10.200 --> 01:38:11.400]   And it was just--
[01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:13.560]   I came on-- actually, I did a very exciting interview
[01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:16.400]   with Megan, in which I just raved about this thing.
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:19.800]   And then the next day when I was writing a full review,
[01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:22.400]   it was just like, well, yes, it is still bloody brilliant.
[01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:24.600]   But at the same time, you know--
[01:38:24.600 --> 01:38:26.840]   I mean, the headset visor they showed to you.
[01:38:26.840 --> 01:38:29.160]   But they were showing you a prototype that was wired
[01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:29.640]   and everything.
[01:38:29.640 --> 01:38:30.140]   Oh, yeah.
[01:38:30.140 --> 01:38:32.760]   I mean, the prototype, you had to carry a battery pack
[01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:35.600]   with three fans going 10 to a dozen on the top of it.
[01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:36.680]   You've got to have it see--
[01:38:36.680 --> 01:38:38.320]   measure the distance between your eyes.
[01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:39.360]   You've got to wear this headset.
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:40.360]   But it worked.
[01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:41.040]   It worked.
[01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:42.520]   And it worked really well.
[01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:45.480]   The thing that-- I mean, yeah, OK, the Minecraft
[01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:46.640]   in the house, that's cute.
[01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:48.520]   Skype calling, that was cute.
[01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:50.920]   The thing that really blew me away, NASA.
[01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:54.760]   NASA have taken the Curiosity rover footage.
[01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:56.120]   And they've built that into that.
[01:38:56.120 --> 01:38:58.920]   And then, you know, a bloke from a JPL came in
[01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:00.160]   and had a chat with it.
[01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:00.840]   I was just--
[01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:01.560]   I was a space geek.
[01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:02.400]   I was just stunned.
[01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:04.200]   But Google's getting into this in a big way.
[01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:05.760]   They've got magic leap investment.
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:06.600]   That's right.
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:08.640]   That's how you have the technology to do it.
[01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:09.640]   Yeah.
[01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:11.920]   I came away from that thinking Oculus Rift
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:13.840]   is a complete waste of time.
[01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:15.000]   I'm wondering if the world's going
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:18.880]   to be divided between Facebook and Oculus Rift on the one hand
[01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:21.360]   and augmented reality and Microsoft and perhaps Google
[01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:22.040]   on the other hand.
[01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:23.440]   But the big problem with Oculus Rift
[01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:25.920]   is it cannot move around the room if you're wearing it
[01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:27.520]   without stopping your toe or falling over.
[01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:28.600]   Because you're not-- you can't see.
[01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:29.640]   No, you can't see a thing.
[01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:30.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:33.520]   But you could drive a car with a HoloLens on.
[01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:34.480]   Just about.
[01:39:34.480 --> 01:39:35.680]   I'd hate to be the passenger.
[01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:38.240]   I'm just screaming quite myself.
[01:39:38.240 --> 01:39:40.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:41.060]   Yeah.
[01:39:41.060 --> 01:39:41.880]   It's going to be there.
[01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:43.440]   I mean, it's years away, right?
[01:39:43.440 --> 01:39:44.720]   HoloLens is years away.
[01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:45.640]   But I feel like it's on the--
[01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:46.760]   No, it's this fall.
[01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:47.240]   --the great track.
[01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:48.640]   It's this fall.
[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:49.240]   No, it is.
[01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:49.600]   It is.
[01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:52.920]   But I mean, for it to be really awesome, right?
[01:39:52.920 --> 01:39:55.120]   I mean, this is a Microsoft year.
[01:39:55.120 --> 01:39:57.880]   Windows 10 HoloLens, you know, they're
[01:39:57.880 --> 01:40:00.840]   becoming such a much more multi-platform.
[01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:02.680]   Somebody in the chat room brought up Microsoft Band
[01:40:02.680 --> 01:40:04.320]   when we were talking about the watch.
[01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:06.360]   That's actually true multi-platform.
[01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:09.240]   And so, if you go to them for doing that.
[01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:12.080]   So I feel like this is a Microsoft year.
[01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:15.160]   There's going to be more to watch, more to cover,
[01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:17.600]   more to be interested in in Microsoft
[01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:19.840]   than there have been in a long time.
[01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:21.560]   HoloLens this fall is a good example of it.
[01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:23.440]   But I think for HoloLens to really--
[01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:26.080]   the promise of HoloLens is still, I think,
[01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:29.920]   a couple years away when it is more like Google Glass
[01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:32.760]   and it is integrated into something you can wear around.
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:34.440]   But when it does--
[01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:36.280]   and I feel like they are on the right track
[01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:37.280]   and they're going to be--
[01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:39.920]   suddenly, they look like they're ahead of the game on this,
[01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:41.920]   that there are a couple steps ahead of everybody else,
[01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:43.000]   interestingly enough.
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.440]   And that's one of the biggest breakthroughs,
[01:40:45.440 --> 01:40:49.360]   the biggest forward-looking areas in technology
[01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:51.960]   is augmented reality, virtual reality,
[01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:53.760]   over the next two or three years.
[01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:57.200]   And so they are going to be in this game big time
[01:40:57.200 --> 01:41:00.800]   and they're one to definitely keep an eye on.
[01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:02.920]   Yeah, I mean, even with prototype sets,
[01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:05.440]   with just a little bit of engineering work,
[01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:07.840]   you could sell that to a theme park.
[01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:08.480]   Yeah.
[01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:09.840]   Just have people wandering around
[01:41:09.840 --> 01:41:12.200]   instead of having an artwork actor jumping out at you,
[01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:14.280]   have someone bursting out saying,
[01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:15.640]   let it be or whatever the song is.
[01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:17.840]   And kids would like would eat it up.
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:19.160]   And yeah, you've got to wear a backpack.
[01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:21.800]   Well, chances are you're wearing a backpack anyway.
[01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:25.880]   So it's-- yeah, I think Ollie Lenz is really, really interesting.
[01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:28.400]   If they do it right, it could be a lot of fun.
[01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:29.960]   If they do it wrong, and let's face it,
[01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:32.400]   Microsoft does have form on this sort of thing.
[01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:35.200]   Then it could be one of the rather big letdown.
[01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:37.360]   It could happen.
[01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:38.920]   Let's take a break, come back with more,
[01:41:38.920 --> 01:41:41.960]   and just a bit Ian Thompson from the Register.
[01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:45.480]   Jason Heiner from CBS Interactive and Tech Republic,
[01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:47.840]   from Mashable, Christina Warren.
[01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:48.800]   We're talking high tech.
[01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:50.960]   We're talking fresh books.
[01:41:50.960 --> 01:41:53.240]   The simple cloud accounting and invoicing solution
[01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:54.680]   that will change your life.
[01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:55.960]   It did me.
[01:41:55.960 --> 01:41:58.360]   As a freelancer, the worst thing in the world is billing,
[01:41:58.360 --> 01:41:58.920]   invoicing.
[01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:01.720]   I hated the end of the month, firing up a Excel,
[01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:03.400]   and trying to figure out my hours were,
[01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:05.360]   and getting all the expenses together.
[01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:08.360]   I just put it off, which means I didn't get paid.
[01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:10.360]   Fresh books solved that for me.
[01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:11.880]   This was back when I was going to Toronto.
[01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:13.640]   Amber MacArthur told me about it.
[01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:15.280]   I had to build Rogers every month.
[01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:17.160]   In Canadian dollars, she said, oh, no problem.
[01:42:17.160 --> 01:42:19.440]   Fresh books handles currencies.
[01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:20.760]   It makes it easier.
[01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:23.600]   Your invoices look pro, and you get paid faster
[01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:27.040]   because it's easier for your clients to pay.
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:28.960]   Fresh books will let you create and send invoices,
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:31.200]   capture and manage your expenses with their fresh book
[01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:32.320]   apps.
[01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:33.840]   Even keep track of time and hours.
[01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:36.400]   Just press a button on the app when you start.
[01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:37.880]   Press it when you stop, and it automatically
[01:42:37.880 --> 01:42:39.560]   gets right into the invoice.
[01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:43.080]   Super intuitive, easy to use.
[01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:46.480]   I felt like, to me, this was my first web 2.0 app.
[01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:49.160]   I mean, this was a mind-boggling experience.
[01:42:49.160 --> 01:42:50.360]   Now here we are.
[01:42:50.360 --> 01:42:52.720]   Five million customers, almost 10 years later,
[01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:55.320]   Fresh books is even better than ever.
[01:42:55.320 --> 01:42:56.760]   They've surveyed many other customers.
[01:42:56.760 --> 01:42:57.760]   They know a lot.
[01:42:57.760 --> 01:43:00.240]   For instance, Fresh books users save about 16 hours
[01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:01.560]   a month on admin tests.
[01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:05.280]   This is like two extra days a month.
[01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:08.280]   You double your revenue in most cases in 24 months,
[01:43:08.280 --> 01:43:11.520]   many in most cases, in many of them, on average.
[01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:13.720]   And on average, they get paid five days faster.
[01:43:13.720 --> 01:43:15.360]   I'm not guaranteeing you'll double your revenue,
[01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:17.280]   although I did come to think of it.

[01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:30.080]   Get started today.
[01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:31.400]   It's free for 30 days.

[01:43:32.800 --> 01:43:35.560]   Just visit freshbooks.com/twit.
[01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:38.480]   All I ask, there they are in their cute little Toronto
[01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:39.880]   brick building.
[01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:40.880]   They're so cool.
[01:43:40.880 --> 01:43:43.200]   Don't forget to enter Twit in the--
[01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:46.000]   how did you hear about a section that way they'll know?
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:49.200]   Freshbooks.com/twit.
[01:43:49.200 --> 01:43:50.200]   We love them.
[01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:51.200]   I think you'll love them too.
[01:43:51.200 --> 01:43:57.200]   Let's see here.
[01:43:57.200 --> 01:43:59.160]   Oh, Time Warner and Comcast.
[01:43:59.160 --> 01:43:59.920]   How's that going?
[01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:00.720]   The merger.
[01:44:00.720 --> 01:44:01.440]   It isn't--
[01:44:01.440 --> 01:44:02.440]   Oh!
[01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:06.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:44:06.440 --> 01:44:08.600]   You know, it was a great article, Frank Allias,
[01:44:08.600 --> 01:44:10.600]   and who used to be Comcast cares on Twitter.
[01:44:10.600 --> 01:44:11.880]   He was the guy.
[01:44:11.880 --> 01:44:15.360]   He revolution-- I think he did more to help Comcast
[01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:19.000]   than any human alive, because he responded to people on Twitter.
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:22.160]   He responded, not only revolutionized Comcast,
[01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:26.560]   but it changed the entire nature of doing customer service
[01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:27.120]   over Twitter.
[01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:29.360]   Like it made it a whole thing.
[01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:30.840]   So he moved on.
[01:44:30.840 --> 01:44:35.080]   I think he's working at Citibank now.
[01:44:35.080 --> 01:44:37.840]   But he said-- and I thought this was hysterical--
[01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:43.760]   he said he believes that the merger didn't happen because of us.
[01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:47.360]   And he said, you know, Comcast, even though they spent something
[01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:51.800]   like $25 million lobbying Congress on this issue,
[01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:54.280]   even though Tom Wheeler is a former head of the National
[01:44:54.280 --> 01:44:55.800]   Cable Television Association--
[01:44:55.800 --> 01:44:57.120]   Remember the whole of fame, as well.
[01:44:57.120 --> 01:44:58.000]   In their Hall of Fame.
[01:44:58.000 --> 01:44:59.720]   And he's the chairman of the FCC.
[01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:02.720]   And by the way, what happened to Tom Wheeler?
[01:45:02.720 --> 01:45:04.280]   Did he flip?
[01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:05.440]   I think he flipped.
[01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:06.640]   Oh, he flipped hard.
[01:45:06.640 --> 01:45:08.440]   He became one of us.
[01:45:08.440 --> 01:45:13.600]   But Frank Allias says-- and here's a guy who's watching very closely.
[01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:14.720]   And has ties to Comcast.
[01:45:14.720 --> 01:45:17.200]   He says, you can spend all the money you want.
[01:45:17.200 --> 01:45:19.680]   You can have the chairman of the FCC in your back pocket.
[01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:21.960]   But if the people don't want it to happen,
[01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:22.720]   it's going to work.
[01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:24.840]   And it was so encouraging to me.
[01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:28.600]   He said, this is Comcast's chickens coming home to roost.
[01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:30.720]   After many years of crappy customer service,
[01:45:30.720 --> 01:45:34.640]   people hated Comcast and basically wrote to their members
[01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:38.080]   of Congress and said, we don't want this merger.
[01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:41.120]   No matter how much you give your member of Congress,
[01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:43.480]   it's the vote that ultimately counts to them.
[01:45:43.480 --> 01:45:44.000]   Yeah.
[01:45:44.000 --> 01:45:45.040]   I mean, at the end of the day, you've
[01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:47.720]   got the two companies with possibly the worst customer
[01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:48.400]   service between--
[01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:49.120]   Horrible.
[01:45:49.120 --> 01:45:50.560]   --trying to get together.
[01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:54.680]   And the American market does not need large large large
[01:45:54.680 --> 01:45:56.040]   Lyaspies and cable companies.
[01:45:56.040 --> 01:45:58.480]   It needs lots of little ones competing properly.
[01:45:58.480 --> 01:46:00.440]   Rather than just trying to lock up the entire market.
[01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:02.520]   And people just looked at the way they're getting treated
[01:46:02.520 --> 01:46:04.520]   by these companies at the moment and said,
[01:46:04.520 --> 01:46:07.720]   if they join together, there's nothing we can do.
[01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:09.840]   And they got on the phone and they got people against it.
[01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:12.080]   It's amazing.
[01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:13.000]   I don't know.
[01:46:13.000 --> 01:46:15.120]   I think everyone who was in the sector
[01:46:15.120 --> 01:46:16.920]   really rejoiced when the news came out
[01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:20.520]   that it was again that the whole deal had fallen down.
[01:46:20.520 --> 01:46:22.800]   But now we've got to see what charter we're going to do.
[01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:24.840]   And if they're going to say, load themselves down with debt
[01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:26.280]   to try and take over TWC.
[01:46:26.280 --> 01:46:27.760]   TWC called charter immediately.
[01:46:27.760 --> 01:46:29.400]   He got on the horn and said, hey, you want to buy us?
[01:46:29.400 --> 01:46:30.480]   We're available.
[01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:30.960]   I know.
[01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:32.440]   It just said.
[01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:34.800]   Well, I happened to running a business for a profit
[01:46:34.800 --> 01:46:36.120]   and growing it.
[01:46:36.120 --> 01:46:36.720]   I don't know.
[01:46:36.720 --> 01:46:37.400]   It pulled me all fast.
[01:46:37.400 --> 01:46:40.480]   Crazy, crazy.
[01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:42.400]   So that's the end of the line on that deal.
[01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:44.680]   And I think they also recognized that it was really
[01:46:44.680 --> 01:46:46.880]   about the government was never going to let this thing happen.
[01:46:46.880 --> 01:46:51.760]   They went to Washington to meet with whoever's
[01:46:51.760 --> 01:46:54.000]   responsible, the FTC or the FCC, I don't know.
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:46:56.200]   And apparently just weren't getting good news.
[01:46:56.200 --> 01:46:58.600]   So there it is.
[01:46:58.600 --> 01:47:00.240]   Tom Wheeler's been a real surprise.
[01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:01.240]   I mean, what the hell are you?
[01:47:01.240 --> 01:47:02.480]   This and that neutrality.
[01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:04.920]   When he was appointed, we were just discussing it
[01:47:04.920 --> 01:47:05.280]   in the office.
[01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:07.480]   And you look at his record and it might as well have
[01:47:07.480 --> 01:47:09.800]   been written by the telecoms industry as the person they
[01:47:09.800 --> 01:47:11.240]   wanted in charge.
[01:47:11.240 --> 01:47:12.680]   And he's just been a revelation.
[01:47:12.680 --> 01:47:13.640]   I don't know what it is.
[01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:16.280]   I mean, whether the government's got something on him or--
[01:47:16.280 --> 01:47:18.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:47:18.280 --> 01:47:21.840]   He realized maybe his duty is to the consumers
[01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:24.800]   and to the public rather than to the lobbyists go figure.
[01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:27.760]   But it's so amazing to see that even the 180
[01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:31.840]   he did from his first proposal for net neutrality
[01:47:31.840 --> 01:47:34.280]   a year ago versus what actually ended up happening
[01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:36.160]   and what he ended up championing.
[01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:38.440]   His original language and his original proposal
[01:47:38.440 --> 01:47:40.040]   was ridiculously out of whack.
[01:47:40.040 --> 01:47:43.400]   And obviously, that's why everyone wrote in and signed
[01:47:43.400 --> 01:47:47.000]   petitions and called their congressmen and filed complaints
[01:47:47.000 --> 01:47:50.120]   and responses with the FCC.
[01:47:50.120 --> 01:47:52.000]   But for him, you're dead on him.
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:53.520]   I mean, do they have something on him?
[01:47:53.520 --> 01:47:57.480]   Because he just literally has done a total 180
[01:47:57.480 --> 01:47:58.800]   from every position.
[01:47:58.800 --> 01:48:03.000]   You would think someone like him and someone in his position
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:04.400]   would take.
[01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:06.840]   Well, I also give credit to John Oliver.
[01:48:06.840 --> 01:48:07.320]   Who's for justices?
[01:48:07.320 --> 01:48:10.600]   I think John Oliver gets some credit because on his show
[01:48:10.600 --> 01:48:15.200]   last week tonight in June, he did probably the best--
[01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:16.240]   wait a minute, watch this here.
[01:48:16.240 --> 01:48:17.360]   Wait a minute, real quickly.
[01:48:17.360 --> 01:48:19.360]   He called Tom Wheeler--
[01:48:19.360 --> 01:48:23.200]   Sure, it's a little offensive to Australia's favorite baby
[01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:24.200]   thing.
[01:48:24.200 --> 01:48:25.200]   He called John--
[01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:26.640]   That is the equivalent of needing a babysitter
[01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:28.160]   and hiring a dingo.
[01:48:28.160 --> 01:48:29.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:32.560]   The top time we were a dingo.
[01:48:32.560 --> 01:48:37.480]   And his excellent conversation about net neutrality
[01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:40.760]   raised, in fact, the issue of Comcast and Netflix--
[01:48:40.760 --> 01:48:42.440]   Comcast putting the screws to Netflix,
[01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:46.680]   as they eventually did, to get access.
[01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:49.040]   And so John Oliver, I think, gets some credit.
[01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:52.080]   I think he raised awareness of people to net neutrality.
[01:48:52.080 --> 01:48:54.960]   I think we can give him some credit for changing Tom
[01:48:54.960 --> 01:48:57.120]   Wheeler's mind a little bit.
[01:48:57.120 --> 01:49:00.200]   And by the way, John Oliver says he is not a dingo.
[01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:04.560]   Well, he's maybe a dingo, but he's one of the nice kinds.
[01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:06.400]   He's a cuddly dingo.
[01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:09.400]   It kind of reminds me of this Supreme Court justices.
[01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:10.280]   You know what I mean?
[01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:12.560]   They go in and they have this voting record.
[01:49:12.560 --> 01:49:14.560]   And you think they're going to be one thing.
[01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:15.520]   And they get in there.
[01:49:15.520 --> 01:49:17.480]   And all of a sudden, they're starting
[01:49:17.480 --> 01:49:19.920]   to act with their conscience.
[01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:23.320]   And you realize that in some cases,
[01:49:23.320 --> 01:49:27.400]   that they're more of a human being with some rational judgment.
[01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:28.680]   It doesn't always happen that way.
[01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:33.600]   But I think with, in this case, in some cases,
[01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:35.680]   two colors have shown through.
[01:49:35.680 --> 01:49:37.840]   He's not an elected official.
[01:49:37.840 --> 01:49:42.120]   He's trying to-- his job is to act rationally
[01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:43.800]   on behalf of the American people.
[01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:49.120]   And so I think the Africanan surprise, he has.
[01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:52.200]   I have to say, the tinful, hot wearing part of my brain.
[01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:54.040]   We literally took a couple of weeks
[01:49:54.040 --> 01:49:55.240]   so that a couple of months off work
[01:49:55.240 --> 01:49:57.720]   and went and volunteered with Obama when he was first
[01:49:57.720 --> 01:49:59.280]   getting his campaign together in 2008.
[01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:00.840]   It's not the same guy.
[01:50:00.840 --> 01:50:03.440]   They sent back a clone.
[01:50:03.440 --> 01:50:04.440]   Right.
[01:50:04.440 --> 01:50:07.440]   It's like that kind of time that he gave,
[01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:09.280]   where the real president dies.
[01:50:09.280 --> 01:50:11.280]   And they find the guy that looks just like him to be president.
[01:50:11.280 --> 01:50:13.200]   It's some other Tom Wheeler.
[01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:14.720]   That's exactly it.
[01:50:14.720 --> 01:50:16.200]   But we were thinking, oh, no, that's OK.
[01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:18.280]   He's playing the long game and sending it back
[01:50:18.280 --> 01:50:20.720]   to get-- in Vigal himself, it's President of Obama,
[01:50:20.720 --> 01:50:22.720]   and get his trust so he can get at the handover all this.
[01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:23.720]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:26.160]   You guys, there is a new Terminator movie coming out.
[01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:27.160]   Oh.
[01:50:27.160 --> 01:50:28.320]   Could he be John Connor?
[01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:30.240]   Could this be like one whole big play?
[01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:32.080]   I mean, there is a new Terminator coming out.
[01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:33.280]   It looks terrible, by the way.
[01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:33.800]   Yeah.
[01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:34.680]   But it is coming out.
[01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:36.800]   I have to-- by the way, Arnold is in it.
[01:50:36.800 --> 01:50:37.640]   Which is really weird.
[01:50:37.640 --> 01:50:38.160]   I know.
[01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:39.880]   He was at CinemaCon on Monday.
[01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:41.840]   And it was really funny because he was there,
[01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:43.040]   and Tom Cruise was there.
[01:50:43.040 --> 01:50:46.280]   And both of them have been in the business
[01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:47.680]   about the cinema of time.
[01:50:47.680 --> 01:50:49.560]   And Arnold Schwarzenegger, somebody
[01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:52.680]   that I was with, compared it to seeing the Lone Ranger opening
[01:50:52.680 --> 01:50:53.760]   up a car dealership.
[01:50:53.760 --> 01:50:54.400]   Yeah.
[01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:56.000]   And that was pretty apt.
[01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:58.920]   Meanwhile, Tom Cruise totally still has it.
[01:50:58.920 --> 01:51:00.280]   I mean, he might be crazy as hell.
[01:51:00.280 --> 01:51:01.800]   Don't sue me, Tom.
[01:51:01.800 --> 01:51:03.240]   But allegedly--
[01:51:03.240 --> 01:51:04.440]   It's charismatic.
[01:51:04.440 --> 01:51:06.480]   But he's charismatic, and he's actually
[01:51:06.480 --> 01:51:09.800]   hanging off the sides of a 400 jets.
[01:51:09.800 --> 01:51:14.040]   And he still has it, whereas Arnold is just sad.
[01:51:14.040 --> 01:51:15.760]   Although Arnold was on Reddit because somebody
[01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:19.080]   posted up a review of the new Genesis, Terminator
[01:51:19.080 --> 01:51:20.800]   Genesis film coming out.
[01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:24.080]   And sure enough, Schwarzenegger on his clear date
[01:51:24.080 --> 01:51:24.840]   came up.
[01:51:24.840 --> 01:51:26.840]   Top comment on that forum was, this person
[01:51:26.840 --> 01:51:28.880]   must have dreamed this movie because they obviously
[01:51:28.880 --> 01:51:29.560]   haven't seen it.
[01:51:29.560 --> 01:51:30.080]   Oh, wow.
[01:51:30.080 --> 01:51:32.320]   He's very good at playing the social media game in a way.
[01:51:32.320 --> 01:51:32.840]   Wow.
[01:51:32.840 --> 01:51:34.440]   Doing it, Tom Cruise really isn't.
[01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:34.960]   I mean, he's--
[01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:35.800]   No.
[01:51:35.800 --> 01:51:36.300]   No.
[01:51:36.300 --> 01:51:37.760]   I mean, if he's not jumping up and down on sofas,
[01:51:37.760 --> 01:51:38.920]   he's not really happy.
[01:51:38.920 --> 01:51:41.120]   No, Tom Cruise doesn't really play the social media game.
[01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:44.200]   But a Schwarzenegger, I guess, is better with that.
[01:51:44.200 --> 01:51:49.360]   But he did take a moment to make a dig at the last Terminator
[01:51:49.360 --> 01:51:51.760]   film saying that it didn't count because he wasn't in it.
[01:51:51.760 --> 01:51:53.480]   And I was thinking, dude, you know what?
[01:51:53.480 --> 01:51:55.200]   Terminator 3 was still pretty bad.
[01:51:55.200 --> 01:51:57.440]   Maybe you don't want to--
[01:51:57.440 --> 01:51:59.360]   I wasn't dean it.
[01:51:59.360 --> 01:52:00.960]   I was barely in Zab 12.
[01:52:00.960 --> 01:52:05.600]   How did we get off on that topic?
[01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:06.040]   I can't--
[01:52:06.040 --> 01:52:09.600]   I don't remember what I was talking about.
[01:52:09.600 --> 01:52:11.760]   You're saying Tom Wheeler is feeling like that.
[01:52:11.760 --> 01:52:13.000]   Oh, yeah, Wheeler.
[01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:14.680]   Ian was saying that he was really good.
[01:52:14.680 --> 01:52:19.360]   I actually think that there is some stuff in--
[01:52:19.360 --> 01:52:21.360]   I'm thrilled that they voted for net neutrality.
[01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:22.680]   Many of my colleagues are not.
[01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:24.120]   And a lot of our viewers are not
[01:52:24.120 --> 01:52:26.160]   think that this is going to be the end of the world,
[01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:29.520]   that we will have to pay a license fee to do a podcast.
[01:52:29.520 --> 01:52:31.160]   None of this is going to happen.
[01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:34.960]   But I do think there is, in some of the language,
[01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:37.560]   a stop anyway to some of the telcos,
[01:52:37.560 --> 01:52:41.920]   that they haven't completely given us everything we want.
[01:52:41.920 --> 01:52:43.800]   And I think that some of--
[01:52:43.800 --> 01:52:47.240]   there will be more to be said about this.
[01:52:47.240 --> 01:52:48.880]   I don't think we won 100%.
[01:52:48.880 --> 01:52:51.560]   On the other hand, I think not having Time Warner and Comcast
[01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:54.080]   merge is good for everybody.
[01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:56.600]   If only they could have stopped Comcast from buying NBC
[01:52:56.600 --> 01:52:57.760]   Universal, right?
[01:52:57.760 --> 01:52:58.880]   To me, that's still--
[01:52:58.880 --> 01:53:01.920]   I mean, that's coming on Friday with Mike Elgin.
[01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:03.760]   That to me is still the biggest travesty.
[01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:04.240]   That was not--
[01:53:04.240 --> 01:53:05.760]   Well, that's why we thought this would go through,
[01:53:05.760 --> 01:53:07.280]   because, god, they let that run through.
[01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:09.120]   And that was obviously terrible.
[01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:10.640]   No, that's what I thought.
[01:53:10.640 --> 01:53:12.440]   That's why I was honestly shocked that it didn't happen.
[01:53:12.440 --> 01:53:15.720]   I was like, well, if they let this very clear conflict of interest
[01:53:15.720 --> 01:53:18.640]   happen, then why won't they won't stop this?
[01:53:18.640 --> 01:53:19.640]   Right.
[01:53:19.640 --> 01:53:20.640]   Well, I guess--
[01:53:20.640 --> 01:53:21.640]   I think it's a new era.
[01:53:21.640 --> 01:53:23.080]   And I think that--
[01:53:23.080 --> 01:53:25.560]   and I think geeks should take this to heart--
[01:53:25.560 --> 01:53:28.560]   that by participating, by being active,
[01:53:28.560 --> 01:53:32.440]   by writing members of Congress, by using the tools available to us,
[01:53:32.440 --> 01:53:35.600]   we can actually sway Congress.
[01:53:35.600 --> 01:53:36.920]   We can sway the FCC.
[01:53:36.920 --> 01:53:38.800]   We can get them to do what we want to do.
[01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:39.760]   But we have to be active.
[01:53:39.760 --> 01:53:43.040]   And those were two hot, hot topics that geeks were very active on.
[01:53:43.040 --> 01:53:45.080]   Restores your faith in democracy.
[01:53:45.080 --> 01:53:47.800]   Well, I think a little bit-- and I think a lot of geeks are very cynical.
[01:53:47.800 --> 01:53:48.840]   And a lot of us are--
[01:53:48.840 --> 01:53:49.840]   Yum.
[01:53:49.840 --> 01:53:51.160]   And we should be.
[01:53:51.160 --> 01:53:52.360]   We should be.
[01:53:52.360 --> 01:53:55.440]   We've got a presidential election coming up in a bit a little over a year.
[01:53:55.440 --> 01:53:57.720]   And it is not going to-- whoever gets nominated,
[01:53:57.720 --> 01:53:59.000]   it's not going to be a choice.
[01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:00.160]   Any of us want to make.
[01:54:00.160 --> 01:54:00.920]   No, really.
[01:54:00.920 --> 01:54:01.440]   No.
[01:54:01.440 --> 01:54:07.000]   And what I think is unfortunate is when that happens,
[01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:09.280]   young people especially get disillusioned
[01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:12.280]   and say, well, see how I can vote for is one muppet or another muppet.
[01:54:12.280 --> 01:54:14.520]   I don't want to either muppet.
[01:54:14.520 --> 01:54:16.840]   So politics obviously doesn't matter.
[01:54:16.840 --> 01:54:17.520]   But it does matter.
[01:54:17.520 --> 01:54:21.840]   On the local level, it can matter on the congressional level.
[01:54:21.840 --> 01:54:25.160]   You need to get involved.
[01:54:25.160 --> 01:54:26.560]   President, maybe not so much.
[01:54:26.560 --> 01:54:28.280]   There's cost so much now.
[01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:28.800]   Yeah.
[01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:32.600]   I think they're saying that it will be a billion and a half dollars
[01:54:32.600 --> 01:54:34.000]   for each side in this presidential election.
[01:54:34.000 --> 01:54:36.640]   Well, you've got this really weird electoral system over here.
[01:54:36.640 --> 01:54:39.200]   Because we're having a general election in the UK at the moment.
[01:54:39.200 --> 01:54:39.560]   Right.
[01:54:39.560 --> 01:54:42.720]   And you are only allowed to campaign for three weeks.
[01:54:42.720 --> 01:54:43.560]   I love that.
[01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:45.560]   The business of government goes on until three weeks
[01:54:45.560 --> 01:54:46.280]   before the election.
[01:54:46.280 --> 01:54:46.760]   There's campaign times.
[01:54:46.760 --> 01:54:48.960]   Everyone goes home against goes campaigning.
[01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:51.280]   And now you've got people who are announcing for the presidency
[01:54:51.280 --> 01:54:52.640]   18 months before the election.
[01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:53.120]   And you have to.
[01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:54.080]   You're going to be hell.
[01:54:54.080 --> 01:54:55.320]   But I mean, most of the police--
[01:54:55.320 --> 01:54:57.720]   And most members of Congress are raising money
[01:54:57.720 --> 01:54:59.440]   all through their term.
[01:54:59.440 --> 01:54:59.960]   Exactly.
[01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:02.760]   And they're raising it from people who want a favor back for it.
[01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:04.920]   So the whole system seems--
[01:55:04.920 --> 01:55:05.520]   We've got to fix that.
[01:55:05.520 --> 01:55:07.080]   Mad.
[01:55:07.080 --> 01:55:10.320]   But do you think Britain is better run than the United States?
[01:55:10.320 --> 01:55:11.520]   In some ways.
[01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:12.520]   In some ways.
[01:55:12.520 --> 01:55:12.880]   Do you want to--
[01:55:12.880 --> 01:55:14.680]   Do you want to take Tony Blair?
[01:55:14.680 --> 01:55:15.360]   Yeah, I know.
[01:55:15.360 --> 01:55:16.360]   I didn't vote for him.
[01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:17.880]   But you know.
[01:55:17.880 --> 01:55:18.960]   Actually, no.
[01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:22.400]   Shame to say I did actually vote from in '97.
[01:55:22.400 --> 01:55:22.920]   You know what?
[01:55:22.920 --> 01:55:24.480]   It's like, look, look, he seemed OK at the time.
[01:55:24.480 --> 01:55:25.480]   He seemed OK at the time.
[01:55:25.480 --> 01:55:28.120]   And then my local Labour MP, the next election,
[01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:30.200]   I wrote her an email the night before the election.
[01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:32.240]   I was terribly drunk.
[01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:34.400]   Just saying, look, I've been a Labour voter all my life.
[01:55:34.400 --> 01:55:37.040]   I just cannot bring myself to vote for that grinning little
[01:55:37.040 --> 01:55:38.280]   whatever.
[01:55:38.280 --> 01:55:40.240]   And she sent me a lovely email saying, Tony will not
[01:55:40.240 --> 01:55:41.480]   be with us for that much longer.
[01:55:41.480 --> 01:55:41.840]   And when he's--
[01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:42.680]   Wow.
[01:55:42.680 --> 01:55:44.200]   You can come back to the fold.
[01:55:44.200 --> 01:55:44.640]   Wow.
[01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:45.720]   He was just--
[01:55:45.720 --> 01:55:47.320]   Tony looked good initially.
[01:55:47.320 --> 01:55:48.960]   Obama looked good initially.
[01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:50.080]   And you know, it's--
[01:55:50.080 --> 01:55:51.080]   I'm very disappointed.
[01:55:51.080 --> 01:55:52.120]   I really--
[01:55:52.120 --> 01:55:54.120]   I voted for Obama both times.
[01:55:54.120 --> 01:55:56.000]   I gave him money.
[01:55:56.000 --> 01:55:57.200]   I really supported him.
[01:55:57.200 --> 01:55:59.400]   I think it's a major step forward that we
[01:55:59.400 --> 01:56:01.040]   have an African-American president.
[01:56:01.040 --> 01:56:04.760]   I believe that the Affordable Care Act
[01:56:04.760 --> 01:56:05.800]   is a very important thing.
[01:56:05.800 --> 01:56:12.040]   But at the same time, drones like out of control,
[01:56:12.040 --> 01:56:14.000]   trans-Pacific trade partnership.
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:19.760]   This fast track on this treaty is appalling.
[01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:21.080]   It's fundamentally undemocratic.
[01:56:21.080 --> 01:56:23.080]   And of course, the eavesdropping,
[01:56:23.080 --> 01:56:26.720]   which has done nothing but increase during his tenure,
[01:56:26.720 --> 01:56:28.760]   all of that kind of has soured me a little bit.
[01:56:28.760 --> 01:56:31.080]   And I'm trying not to get soured of politics in general.
[01:56:31.080 --> 01:56:32.320]   The thing is, I don't see anything change.
[01:56:32.320 --> 01:56:33.400]   I mean, Hillary seems to be--
[01:56:33.400 --> 01:56:34.160]   No, should be exact the same.
[01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:34.920]   --the ad presumptive.
[01:56:34.920 --> 01:56:36.080]   And she's even more of the--
[01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:37.800]   and I say it's backside than Obama was.
[01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:39.600]   So I mean, it's just--
[01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:40.080]   I don't know.
[01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:41.880]   You guys, I shouldn't really be commenting.
[01:56:41.880 --> 01:56:42.600]   It's your election.
[01:56:42.600 --> 01:56:44.040]   It's your country where you guys think.
[01:56:44.040 --> 01:56:44.440]   No, no.
[01:56:44.440 --> 01:56:45.480]   It's your country too.
[01:56:45.480 --> 01:56:49.800]   Because after all, what we do influences everything,
[01:56:49.800 --> 01:56:53.320]   especially our allies across the pond.
[01:56:53.320 --> 01:56:54.080]   Don't you think?
[01:56:54.080 --> 01:56:55.560]   That was what was wrong with Tony Blair.
[01:56:55.560 --> 01:56:56.720]   He's using our back pockets.
[01:56:56.720 --> 01:56:57.360]   Yeah, I know.
[01:56:57.360 --> 01:56:58.760]   And that's caused a real backlash.
[01:56:58.760 --> 01:57:00.520]   And it's much less the case now.
[01:57:00.520 --> 01:57:01.920]   I mean, people are looking to--
[01:57:01.920 --> 01:57:03.400]   actually, people are looking towards Europe
[01:57:03.400 --> 01:57:04.600]   and then looking to get out of Europe
[01:57:04.600 --> 01:57:06.800]   and just go out alone, which I personally think is madness.
[01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:09.360]   But everyone's got the choice to do.
[01:57:09.360 --> 01:57:11.960]   But no, particularly after the last two presidents,
[01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:17.800]   then America is no longer as influential over there as it was.
[01:57:17.800 --> 01:57:19.280]   And we have a new call.
[01:57:19.280 --> 01:57:20.880]   My phone is ringing again.
[01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:21.680]   Answer the phone.
[01:57:21.680 --> 01:57:22.880]   All right, let's see if this works.
[01:57:22.880 --> 01:57:23.840]   Yeah, answer the watch.
[01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:26.640]   Hi, Abby, is that you?
[01:57:26.640 --> 01:57:27.160]   Yep.
[01:57:27.160 --> 01:57:28.160]   How are you?
[01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:29.760]   I'm talking to you on my watch right now.
[01:57:29.760 --> 01:57:32.000]   How do I sound?
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.080]   It actually sounds really good.
[01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:34.960]   Yeah?
[01:57:34.960 --> 01:57:36.400]   You sound pretty good, too.
[01:57:36.400 --> 01:57:38.200]   It sounds pretty much like you're on a phone.
[01:57:38.200 --> 01:57:39.320]   Well, yeah.
[01:57:39.320 --> 01:57:39.680]   That's it.
[01:57:39.680 --> 01:57:40.920]   I mean, you still need to phone.
[01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:42.240]   The phone's right next to me.
[01:57:42.240 --> 01:57:43.640]   But I guess the microphone-- in fact,
[01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:45.400]   I think they've done something with the microphones
[01:57:45.400 --> 01:57:47.640]   because everybody's saying Siri works better on the Apple Watch,
[01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:48.560]   too.
[01:57:48.560 --> 01:57:51.080]   But the question is, would you want to make a phone call talking
[01:57:51.080 --> 01:57:52.800]   to your watch like Dick Tracy all the time?
[01:57:52.800 --> 01:57:58.680]   Did you-- I was just saying, if you
[01:57:58.680 --> 01:58:00.560]   were able to make a phone call on your watch,
[01:58:00.560 --> 01:58:03.960]   would you want to talk to it all the time like Dick Tracy?
[01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:05.280]   Do you know who Dick Tracy is?
[01:58:05.280 --> 01:58:06.640]   Yeah.
[01:58:06.640 --> 01:58:07.840]   OK.
[01:58:07.840 --> 01:58:08.760]   No.
[01:58:08.760 --> 01:58:09.560]   OK.
[01:58:09.560 --> 01:58:11.000]   I would--
[01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:12.520]   I thought it was only 23.
[01:58:12.520 --> 01:58:14.760]   --on the phone be on the phone because the technology is
[01:58:14.760 --> 01:58:18.640]   so new that the call would get messed up in some way?
[01:58:18.640 --> 01:58:19.640]   It seems to be working.
[01:58:19.640 --> 01:58:23.000]   I mean, cell phones are kind of unreliable anyway.
[01:58:23.000 --> 01:58:25.360]   I think it's kind of interesting that you can do this.
[01:58:25.360 --> 01:58:27.960]   I have a feeling it would be mostly for things like, oh,
[01:58:27.960 --> 01:58:28.880]   I can't talk right now.
[01:58:28.880 --> 01:58:29.800]   I'm on the air.
[01:58:29.800 --> 01:58:30.840]   Can I call you back?
[01:58:30.840 --> 01:58:33.520]   That kind of thing.
[01:58:33.520 --> 01:58:34.600]   Anyway, I love you, Abby.
[01:58:34.600 --> 01:58:37.280]   I'll talk to you later, OK?
[01:58:37.280 --> 01:58:37.640]   Cool.
[01:58:37.640 --> 01:58:38.280]   Yeah.
[01:58:38.280 --> 01:58:39.440]   That's pretty good, actually.
[01:58:39.440 --> 01:58:40.440]   Good.
[01:58:40.440 --> 01:58:42.560]   It's a little muffled occasionally,
[01:58:42.560 --> 01:58:43.920]   but that just might be how you're talking.
[01:58:43.920 --> 01:58:45.080]   I think it's my sleeve.
[01:58:45.080 --> 01:58:50.120]   All right.
[01:58:50.120 --> 01:58:51.840]   I think the microphone's right here.
[01:58:51.840 --> 01:58:52.720]   Love you.
[01:58:52.720 --> 01:58:54.080]   Bye.
[01:58:54.080 --> 01:58:56.160]   Talk to you later tonight.
[01:58:56.160 --> 01:58:57.760]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:58:57.760 --> 01:58:59.040]   I don't-- I mean, that's one thing
[01:58:59.040 --> 01:59:01.200]   that the Apple Watch could do that no Android Wear Watch
[01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:01.720]   can do.
[01:59:01.720 --> 01:59:02.240]   That's true.
[01:59:02.240 --> 01:59:03.840]   But didn't you feel like a bit of a plonker when you were--
[01:59:03.840 --> 01:59:05.320]   Yeah, I thought I made your plonker.
[01:59:05.320 --> 01:59:05.800]   Yeah.
[01:59:05.800 --> 01:59:06.960]   And I don't even know what that means.
[01:59:06.960 --> 01:59:09.360]   Sounds like a Atlantic fish.
[01:59:09.360 --> 01:59:10.160]   Not good.
[01:59:10.160 --> 01:59:13.320]   It's not good.
[01:59:13.320 --> 01:59:14.760]   The Department of Homeland Security
[01:59:14.760 --> 01:59:16.320]   is opening an office at Silicon Valley.
[01:59:16.320 --> 01:59:16.520]   Woohoo.
[01:59:16.520 --> 01:59:20.720]   Woohoo.
[01:59:20.720 --> 01:59:22.520]   Well, considering how they have many people
[01:59:22.520 --> 01:59:24.400]   that annoyed this week at the RSA show,
[01:59:24.400 --> 01:59:25.400]   then they're not going to be potentially--
[01:59:25.400 --> 01:59:26.720]   They said this.
[01:59:26.720 --> 01:59:30.800]   This is the quote from DHS Secretary Jay Johnson
[01:59:30.800 --> 01:59:32.760]   in his speech at the RSA conference,
[01:59:32.760 --> 01:59:34.960]   "We want to strengthen critical relationships
[01:59:34.960 --> 01:59:37.480]   in Silicon Valley and assure that the government
[01:59:37.480 --> 01:59:40.120]   and private sector benefit from each other's research
[01:59:40.120 --> 01:59:41.760]   and development."
[01:59:41.760 --> 01:59:45.120]   That's absolutely what we do not want.
[01:59:45.120 --> 01:59:45.440]   Yeah.
[01:59:45.440 --> 01:59:49.960]   I mean, they would-- the Homeland Security at RSA this week,
[01:59:49.960 --> 01:59:54.320]   you also got Obama's cybersecurity aid or whatever,
[01:59:54.320 --> 01:59:56.480]   Congressman Mike Richards or whatever,
[01:59:56.480 --> 01:59:59.360]   from who was over saying, and they all said the same thing.
[01:59:59.360 --> 02:00:03.400]   We need a perfectly safe, strong form of encryption,
[02:00:03.400 --> 02:00:06.600]   which the law enforcement can also access.
[02:00:06.600 --> 02:00:08.840]   And every single person who knew anything
[02:00:08.840 --> 02:00:11.760]   about cryptography there was just like, you don't get it,
[02:00:11.760 --> 02:00:12.680]   do you?
[02:00:12.680 --> 02:00:14.840]   But Silicon Valley can invent anything.
[02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:16.840]   No, math doesn't work like that.
[02:00:16.840 --> 02:00:18.880]   And even if you're still pushing the backdoor.
[02:00:18.880 --> 02:00:19.280]   Yeah.
[02:00:19.280 --> 02:00:21.400]   I mean, I thought we got the settle in the late '90s.
[02:00:21.400 --> 02:00:24.200]   And they did-- you've got a new generation of politicians
[02:00:24.200 --> 02:00:25.600]   who's come through who just-- you've
[02:00:25.600 --> 02:00:27.760]   got to explain it to them again and again.
[02:00:27.760 --> 02:00:29.800]   It doesn't work like that.
[02:00:29.800 --> 02:00:32.880]   And even if it did, you then got to give that same power
[02:00:32.880 --> 02:00:34.560]   to law enforcement around the world.
[02:00:34.560 --> 02:00:34.960]   Yeah.
[02:00:34.960 --> 02:00:35.440]   So--
[02:00:35.440 --> 02:00:36.120]   Right.
[02:00:36.120 --> 02:00:37.400]   And who at the end of the day is
[02:00:37.400 --> 02:00:39.480]   going to buy an Apple or an Android phone
[02:00:39.480 --> 02:00:42.360]   if they know that the encryption is already broken?
[02:00:42.360 --> 02:00:44.400]   It makes no logical sense at all.
[02:00:44.400 --> 02:00:46.080]   I had one cryptographer in the public,
[02:00:46.080 --> 02:00:48.120]   and at the later at night, who was just like--
[02:00:48.120 --> 02:00:49.720]   it's just-- I mean, he's British.
[02:00:49.720 --> 02:00:50.880]   So it's just bollocks.
[02:00:50.880 --> 02:00:52.760]   There's no possible way they could do this.
[02:00:52.760 --> 02:00:53.920]   But they will not see it.
[02:00:53.920 --> 02:00:56.600]   They keep on thinking we can invent a miracle.
[02:00:56.600 --> 02:00:59.800]   It was David Cameron who actually first proposed this.
[02:00:59.800 --> 02:01:00.640]   Don't give me stuff.
[02:01:00.640 --> 02:01:01.480]   I'm not shotty-faced.
[02:01:01.480 --> 02:01:03.080]   I'll put it in his.
[02:01:03.080 --> 02:01:05.480]   You don't like him either, huh?
[02:01:05.480 --> 02:01:08.000]   Because if you want to set a chill down in your spine,
[02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:09.200]   listen to what else Johnson said.
[02:01:09.200 --> 02:01:12.960]   He says he wants the DHS to go full throttle on technology
[02:01:12.960 --> 02:01:15.560]   that will help it monitor cybersecurity threats in the US.
[02:01:15.560 --> 02:01:17.800]   Quote, "Later this year, we will be in a position
[02:01:17.800 --> 02:01:19.920]   to begin to accept cyber threat indicators
[02:01:19.920 --> 02:01:24.680]   from the private sector in automated near real time format."
[02:01:24.680 --> 02:01:25.180]   Yeah.
[02:01:25.180 --> 02:01:26.400]   The laws went through the House of Representatives,
[02:01:26.400 --> 02:01:26.900]   this week.
[02:01:26.900 --> 02:01:27.760]   Direct connection.
[02:01:27.760 --> 02:01:30.240]   We just want to connect right up to Google and Facebook
[02:01:30.240 --> 02:01:31.040]   and everybody else.
[02:01:31.040 --> 02:01:33.040]   Well, they're already doing that through the NSA already.
[02:01:33.040 --> 02:01:33.480]   That's why.
[02:01:33.480 --> 02:01:34.040]   And then we'll--
[02:01:34.040 --> 02:01:35.240]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[02:01:35.240 --> 02:01:37.360]   But I mean, the House of Representatives
[02:01:37.360 --> 02:01:40.320]   did pass two laws, one of which would allow for anonymized
[02:01:40.320 --> 02:01:42.280]   data sharing between government and companies.
[02:01:42.280 --> 02:01:43.480]   Well, what good is anonymized?
[02:01:43.480 --> 02:01:46.280]   How am I going to capture a terrorist if I don't know who he is?
[02:01:46.280 --> 02:01:49.160]   Oh, but it's all in the metadata.
[02:01:49.160 --> 02:01:51.880]   And then the other one gave companies freedom from liability
[02:01:51.880 --> 02:01:54.480]   and freedom from being sued under freedom of information
[02:01:54.480 --> 02:01:56.200]   rights.
[02:01:56.200 --> 02:01:57.360]   This thing is going on.
[02:01:57.360 --> 02:01:59.120]   And from what I can see, Senate is going to pass it
[02:01:59.120 --> 02:02:01.720]   and the bomb is going to sign off on it.
[02:02:01.720 --> 02:02:04.200]   I'm watching the chatroom debate, the meaning of bollocks,
[02:02:04.200 --> 02:02:05.720]   by the way.
[02:02:05.720 --> 02:02:08.400]   I think we'll leave that as an exercise for the reader.
[02:02:08.400 --> 02:02:09.280]   Let's take a little break.
[02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:11.360]   We've got more to come.
[02:02:11.360 --> 02:02:14.040]   We're talking high tech.
[02:02:14.040 --> 02:02:15.760]   I don't want to be depressed.
[02:02:15.760 --> 02:02:18.960]   It's going to be a great new world,
[02:02:18.960 --> 02:02:22.880]   wonderful new world, as long as the AI doesn't kill us.
[02:02:22.880 --> 02:02:25.640]   Has anybody seen that new movie yet?
[02:02:25.640 --> 02:02:29.320]   X-Maconica Gary was here and was just raving about it.
[02:02:29.320 --> 02:02:30.040]   Yeah, I saw it.
[02:02:30.040 --> 02:02:30.840]   It's really good.
[02:02:30.840 --> 02:02:31.760]   Is it?
[02:02:31.760 --> 02:02:32.560]   It is.
[02:02:32.560 --> 02:02:32.880]   Ooh.
[02:02:32.880 --> 02:02:33.680]   Is it scary?
[02:02:33.680 --> 02:02:38.320]   Do you feel like the artificial intelligence is going to win?
[02:02:38.320 --> 02:02:40.560]   I mean, yeah, but I always feel that way.
[02:02:40.560 --> 02:02:41.560]   Yeah.
[02:02:41.560 --> 02:02:42.200]   Well, you know what?
[02:02:42.200 --> 02:02:43.400]   Woz now says this.
[02:02:43.400 --> 02:02:45.800]   Everybody's starting to-- all the computer scientists
[02:02:45.800 --> 02:02:47.480]   are all saying, we've got to worry.
[02:02:47.480 --> 02:02:48.480]   What?
[02:02:48.480 --> 02:02:50.080]   Yeah, Elon Musk is really free.
[02:02:50.080 --> 02:02:51.200]   He's worried.
[02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:53.360]   He's completely right.
[02:02:53.360 --> 02:02:55.120]   I'm just worried about it taking over the world.
[02:02:55.120 --> 02:02:57.520]   I'm more worried about it taking my job to be quite frank,
[02:02:57.520 --> 02:02:58.080]   because--
[02:02:58.080 --> 02:02:58.880]   Well, first you take--
[02:02:58.880 --> 02:02:59.680]   --take job, then it takes over.
[02:02:59.680 --> 02:03:01.800]   Well, yeah, in 30 years down the line,
[02:03:01.800 --> 02:03:02.280]   there's a whole lot of--
[02:03:02.280 --> 02:03:02.560]   Is that crazy?
[02:03:02.560 --> 02:03:04.560]   --able or right for the register?
[02:03:04.560 --> 02:03:06.080]   No, no, nobody can do that.
[02:03:06.080 --> 02:03:10.080]   If I'm a very cynical, emotionally drunk human beings.
[02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:14.680]   But I mean, if you're an accountant, if you're a lawyer,
[02:03:14.680 --> 02:03:17.080]   if you're certainly a legal secretary,
[02:03:17.080 --> 02:03:20.040]   20, 30 years down the line, your job is toast.
[02:03:20.040 --> 02:03:21.800]   You should all be pundits, because that's
[02:03:21.800 --> 02:03:25.600]   the one thing an artificial intelligence can't do well.
[02:03:25.600 --> 02:03:27.120]   This is going to be a common theme,
[02:03:27.120 --> 02:03:28.680]   but we have another long-form article on this
[02:03:28.680 --> 02:03:31.480]   called Why AI Can Destroy More Jobs Than It Creates
[02:03:31.480 --> 02:03:32.840]   and How to Save Them.
[02:03:32.840 --> 02:03:36.440]   But it's actually-- so it has some interviews
[02:03:36.440 --> 02:03:38.880]   with a number of the people that-- like at MIT
[02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:42.280]   and other places that are working on AI, Eric Bernalfson,
[02:03:42.280 --> 02:03:44.320]   who did the second machine age of the book,
[02:03:44.320 --> 02:03:46.040]   the second machine age, and others.
[02:03:46.040 --> 02:03:49.160]   And ultimately, actually, if you read the article,
[02:03:49.160 --> 02:03:52.920]   there are some things to come away with.
[02:03:52.920 --> 02:03:55.960]   I'm not as freaked as Bill Gates or Elon Musk.
[02:03:55.960 --> 02:03:57.240]   I'm not as smart as those guys either.
[02:03:57.240 --> 02:04:02.280]   But I think that these researchers who are working on this stuff
[02:04:02.280 --> 02:04:06.640]   bring up some ways that clearly AI is a long, long way
[02:04:06.640 --> 02:04:09.760]   from getting even close and may never, ever
[02:04:09.760 --> 02:04:13.920]   be able to deal with the kinds of experiential knowledge
[02:04:13.920 --> 02:04:17.520]   that human beings can, where they take two different kinds
[02:04:17.520 --> 02:04:19.920]   of knowledge and bring them together
[02:04:19.920 --> 02:04:22.920]   and then come up with conclusions.
[02:04:22.920 --> 02:04:27.600]   And then now it's going to automate a lot of manual labor
[02:04:27.600 --> 02:04:30.320]   jobs, but we've been worried about that for decades.
[02:04:30.320 --> 02:04:33.760]   And the likely result of that is that people
[02:04:33.760 --> 02:04:36.680]   are then in those jobs going to have more time.
[02:04:36.680 --> 02:04:39.640]   And that will-- it's a brutal process,
[02:04:39.640 --> 02:04:42.400]   but that will-- every time we've had one of these leaps
[02:04:42.400 --> 02:04:45.160]   forward in technology, what happens
[02:04:45.160 --> 02:04:49.120]   is humans find better, smarter, more interesting things to do.
[02:04:49.120 --> 02:04:51.080]   And it ends up pushing humanity forward.
[02:04:51.080 --> 02:04:52.120]   Let's see.
[02:04:52.120 --> 02:04:56.560]   Like, that's a very optimistic view.
[02:04:56.560 --> 02:04:58.080]   You're an optimist.
[02:04:58.080 --> 02:05:02.000]   But looking at history, that tends to be the way
[02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:03.040]   these things happen.
[02:05:03.040 --> 02:05:04.120]   Jason, I actually want to-- we're
[02:05:04.120 --> 02:05:05.080]   going to take a break.
[02:05:05.080 --> 02:05:06.720]   I want to talk to you about your visit to Osmo,
[02:05:06.720 --> 02:05:09.400]   the robot, the Honda robot.
[02:05:09.400 --> 02:05:14.360]   It's not like anything like this on my screen could happen.
[02:05:14.360 --> 02:05:17.680]   This couldn't possibly ever--
[02:05:17.680 --> 02:05:20.080]   Oh.
[02:05:20.080 --> 02:05:23.560]   Here comes Spot.
[02:05:23.560 --> 02:05:26.720]   Google owns this company, the Boston Dynamics Company.
[02:05:26.720 --> 02:05:29.160]   They were making military robots.
[02:05:29.160 --> 02:05:32.240]   Now this is just a male delivery system.
[02:05:32.240 --> 02:05:34.920]   Oh, no, that's still making military robots.
[02:05:34.920 --> 02:05:36.200]   They're still making.
[02:05:36.200 --> 02:05:39.000]   Look, you can kick it and it just keeps on coming.
[02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:41.280]   I would not want to run into this in the hall.
[02:05:41.280 --> 02:05:43.120]   No.
[02:05:43.120 --> 02:05:45.400]   And I don't think kicking it is a very good idea.
[02:05:45.400 --> 02:05:50.600]   This is why the artificial intelligence is mad at us.
[02:05:50.600 --> 02:05:56.040]   Our show today brought to you by GoToMeetingTheGreatWay.
[02:05:56.040 --> 02:05:58.680]   Now you can use technology to eliminate travel,
[02:05:58.680 --> 02:06:01.760]   to stay at home, to meet with clients and coworkers
[02:06:01.760 --> 02:06:05.600]   all over the world from the comfort of your own computer,
[02:06:05.600 --> 02:06:07.360]   your tablet, your smartphone.
[02:06:07.360 --> 02:06:09.200]   No traffic, no travel expenses.
[02:06:09.200 --> 02:06:09.920]   It's easy.
[02:06:09.920 --> 02:06:10.960]   It's fun.
[02:06:10.960 --> 02:06:14.480]   In fact, it's so easy that your clients will like this.
[02:06:14.480 --> 02:06:15.640]   You can't make them jump through hoops
[02:06:15.640 --> 02:06:17.440]   if you want to give them a sales presentation.
[02:06:17.440 --> 02:06:20.840]   But by just clicking a link in just a few seconds,
[02:06:20.840 --> 02:06:22.800]   they'll have GoToMeeting running on their system.
[02:06:22.800 --> 02:06:24.240]   They don't have to sign up for anything.
[02:06:24.240 --> 02:06:25.600]   There's no speed bumps.
[02:06:25.600 --> 02:06:27.160]   You see the same screen.
[02:06:27.160 --> 02:06:28.840]   You could show them the presentation.
[02:06:28.840 --> 02:06:32.800]   You can use your webcam for HD video, which is fabulous.
[02:06:32.800 --> 02:06:34.960]   It is a great way to meet.
[02:06:34.960 --> 02:06:37.880]   I think video meetings are just the way to go.
[02:06:37.880 --> 02:06:39.720]   I've been doing a lot of this lately and I love it.
[02:06:39.720 --> 02:06:41.400]   I want you to try it at least.
[02:06:41.400 --> 02:06:43.840]   For 30 days, visit GoToMeeting.com.
[02:06:43.840 --> 02:06:44.880]   Click the try it free button.
[02:06:44.880 --> 02:06:46.080]   You don't need to give them a credit card.
[02:06:46.080 --> 02:06:48.440]   You'll have your first meeting up and running
[02:06:48.440 --> 02:06:49.680]   in just minutes.
[02:06:49.680 --> 02:06:54.200]   G-O-T-O, go to meeting.com.
[02:06:54.200 --> 02:06:56.560]   Your 30-day trial awaits at GoToMeeting.
[02:06:56.560 --> 02:06:57.400]   I hear they come.
[02:06:57.400 --> 02:06:58.240]   There's two of them.
[02:06:58.240 --> 02:06:59.400]   This is really scary.
[02:06:59.400 --> 02:07:00.760]   This is like, I could see.
[02:07:00.760 --> 02:07:02.160]   Don't you think, I mean, give them what we're doing
[02:07:02.160 --> 02:07:03.600]   with drones.
[02:07:03.600 --> 02:07:06.600]   The next thing is a soldier like this, right?
[02:07:06.600 --> 02:07:07.840]   Yeah.
[02:07:07.840 --> 02:07:08.600]   Oh, sorry.
[02:07:08.600 --> 02:07:09.640]   Up to you.
[02:07:09.640 --> 02:07:11.240]   No, I was just going to say, yes, absolutely.
[02:07:11.240 --> 02:07:12.080]   That's the next thing.
[02:07:12.080 --> 02:07:15.080]   Why put humans in the line of fire when you could send a dog
[02:07:15.080 --> 02:07:16.680]   with a gun?
[02:07:16.680 --> 02:07:18.880]   Yeah, there's a couple of problems to beat first.
[02:07:18.880 --> 02:07:20.400]   I mean, chiefly it's power.
[02:07:20.400 --> 02:07:21.800]   These things cannot break down.
[02:07:21.800 --> 02:07:23.080]   Yeah, there's noise.
[02:07:23.080 --> 02:07:23.840]   Yeah, they do.
[02:07:23.840 --> 02:07:24.360]   Yeah.
[02:07:24.360 --> 02:07:25.760]   Those aren't going to sneak up on anybody.
[02:07:25.760 --> 02:07:27.880]   If you go to actual engine and you're trying to stealthily
[02:07:27.880 --> 02:07:30.480]   get behind enemy lines, that's not going to work.
[02:07:30.480 --> 02:07:33.840]   And I'll tell you how cool this company Boston Dynamics is.
[02:07:33.840 --> 02:07:35.480]   At the end of the video, they put this,
[02:07:35.480 --> 02:07:38.320]   no robots were harmed in the making of this video.
[02:07:38.320 --> 02:07:40.320]   I'm not worried about the robots.
[02:07:40.320 --> 02:07:41.600]   Harm the robots.
[02:07:41.600 --> 02:07:43.160]   It's fine.
[02:07:43.160 --> 02:07:44.480]   It's a human's I'm worried about.
[02:07:44.480 --> 02:07:45.520]   So you met Asimo.
[02:07:45.520 --> 02:07:46.680]   That's we've seen this before.
[02:07:46.680 --> 02:07:49.280]   That's Honda's little humanoid robots about what?
[02:07:49.280 --> 02:07:51.960]   Three feet tall, four feet tall.
[02:07:51.960 --> 02:07:53.320]   He's gone.
[02:07:53.320 --> 02:07:54.440]   Oh my god, the robots.
[02:07:54.440 --> 02:07:56.920]   I said they could frighten him with the robot.
[02:07:56.920 --> 02:07:58.880]   Oh my god.
[02:07:58.880 --> 02:08:01.680]   He saw Asimo and he was scared enough that Boston
[02:08:01.680 --> 02:08:02.760]   Dynamics made him.
[02:08:02.760 --> 02:08:04.200]   Oh my god.
[02:08:04.200 --> 02:08:06.240]   We've lost Jason.
[02:08:06.240 --> 02:08:08.120]   So Christian, you recommend X-Mack.
[02:08:08.120 --> 02:08:09.600]   And I was thinking of going tonight.
[02:08:09.600 --> 02:08:10.760]   Yeah, no, I really liked it.
[02:08:10.760 --> 02:08:11.760]   I really, really liked it.
[02:08:11.760 --> 02:08:14.680]   And I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did,
[02:08:14.680 --> 02:08:16.040]   but I really liked it.
[02:08:16.040 --> 02:08:17.320]   It's good.
[02:08:17.320 --> 02:08:18.600]   Yeah, I can't wait to see it.
[02:08:18.600 --> 02:08:20.360]   It's said there's graphic sex in it.
[02:08:20.360 --> 02:08:24.320]   I don't understand because there's just two guys in a robot.
[02:08:24.320 --> 02:08:25.640]   Maybe I shouldn't go see this.
[02:08:25.640 --> 02:08:26.520]   She's hot though.
[02:08:26.520 --> 02:08:27.080]   She's hot.
[02:08:27.080 --> 02:08:28.440]   Hey, as long as it's better than Lucy,
[02:08:28.440 --> 02:08:29.680]   because I sat through the out film
[02:08:29.680 --> 02:08:32.400]   and there was like, wow, that's two hours of maybe life I want.
[02:08:32.400 --> 02:08:34.280]   You know what I liked though is her.
[02:08:34.280 --> 02:08:35.240]   Her was great.
[02:08:35.240 --> 02:08:36.440]   I like Scarlett Johansson.
[02:08:36.440 --> 02:08:38.120]   She's my artificial intelligence.
[02:08:38.120 --> 02:08:40.560]   I wouldn't mind that.
[02:08:40.560 --> 02:08:41.320]   Who would, man?
[02:08:41.320 --> 02:08:41.880]   I mean, come on.
[02:08:41.880 --> 02:08:44.440]   I think we would all like that.
[02:08:44.440 --> 02:08:45.240]   Totally.
[02:08:45.240 --> 02:08:48.120]   So Jason, were you impressed by Azimah's abilities
[02:08:48.120 --> 02:08:50.120]   or do you feel like we don't have to--
[02:08:50.120 --> 02:08:53.320]   he's not a threat?
[02:08:53.320 --> 02:08:54.760]   Azimah's definitely not a threat.
[02:08:54.760 --> 02:08:56.000]   No, he's sweet.
[02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:56.640]   He's kind.
[02:08:56.640 --> 02:08:59.360]   But one of the interesting things--
[02:08:59.360 --> 02:09:01.560]   the biggest takeaway from this is that Honda's
[02:09:01.560 --> 02:09:03.080]   been working on this for a long time.
[02:09:03.080 --> 02:09:05.760]   They've been working on this since the 1980s for 30 years.
[02:09:05.760 --> 02:09:11.920]   And they have developed what is the most humanoid-like robot
[02:09:11.920 --> 02:09:14.760]   that we have in existence.
[02:09:14.760 --> 02:09:20.000]   And Azimah itself is about the 12th version
[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:21.640]   of the humanoid robot.
[02:09:21.640 --> 02:09:25.480]   And it came out in 2000.
[02:09:25.480 --> 02:09:28.760]   I remember seeing it walk upstairs fall over.
[02:09:28.760 --> 02:09:29.760]   Yes.
[02:09:29.760 --> 02:09:33.560]   And they've been real upfront about the research
[02:09:33.560 --> 02:09:37.000]   and the trial and error that has gone into this.
[02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:38.920]   And every year, it keeps advancing.
[02:09:38.920 --> 02:09:40.560]   It keeps doing more.
[02:09:40.560 --> 02:09:42.920]   And now, it can kick a soccer ball.
[02:09:42.920 --> 02:09:44.800]   It can walk up and down stairs.
[02:09:44.800 --> 02:09:46.280]   It can run.
[02:09:46.280 --> 02:09:47.680]   It can pick things up for you.
[02:09:47.680 --> 02:09:48.600]   It can shake hands.
[02:09:48.600 --> 02:09:50.560]   There's another photo where I was shaking here.
[02:09:50.560 --> 02:09:52.280]   I was going to video about it shaking hands.
[02:09:52.280 --> 02:09:55.480]   Now, was it a firm handshake?
[02:09:55.480 --> 02:09:56.480]   It was pretty firm.
[02:09:56.480 --> 02:09:57.680]   Yeah, it was pretty firm.
[02:09:57.680 --> 02:10:00.880]   It seemed like you didn't want to let go.
[02:10:00.880 --> 02:10:02.440]   No.
[02:10:02.440 --> 02:10:03.440]   You did not want to let go.
[02:10:03.440 --> 02:10:07.000]   Yeah, that worries me a little bit, which is interesting.
[02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:08.400]   But as soon as I--
[02:10:08.400 --> 02:10:12.920]   but it was smart enough to, when I disengaged my grip--
[02:10:12.920 --> 02:10:14.160]   It gave up.
[02:10:14.160 --> 02:10:14.680]   It gave up.
[02:10:14.680 --> 02:10:15.680]   It disengaged.
[02:10:15.680 --> 02:10:16.680]   OK.
[02:10:16.680 --> 02:10:21.160]   But this is a long way from being usable.
[02:10:21.160 --> 02:10:24.840]   And artificial intelligence is the next big thing
[02:10:24.840 --> 02:10:27.320]   that can feed into this.
[02:10:27.320 --> 02:10:29.240]   But one of the things I push them on is,
[02:10:29.240 --> 02:10:31.400]   are you guys connecting up to the cloud?
[02:10:31.400 --> 02:10:33.480]   Are you partnering with people who
[02:10:33.480 --> 02:10:35.480]   are doing artificial intelligence and that kind of thing?
[02:10:35.480 --> 02:10:36.000]   And they are.
[02:10:36.000 --> 02:10:37.520]   And they're working on some of those things.
[02:10:37.520 --> 02:10:40.440]   They were kind of coy about how much of that they're doing.
[02:10:40.440 --> 02:10:43.120]   Because there's a lot of massive processing
[02:10:43.120 --> 02:10:45.960]   that can go on in the cloud doing things like IBM's
[02:10:45.960 --> 02:10:48.720]   doing with lots and those type of things.
[02:10:48.720 --> 02:10:53.760]   But we're a long, long way from this being something
[02:10:53.760 --> 02:10:57.440]   that can be human-like.
[02:10:57.440 --> 02:11:03.880]   They're aiming Osmo as being a helper in the home, for instance.
[02:11:03.880 --> 02:11:09.120]   So people that have some kind of physical limitations, right?
[02:11:09.120 --> 02:11:10.800]   It can pick things up for you.
[02:11:10.800 --> 02:11:12.280]   It can answer the door for you.
[02:11:12.280 --> 02:11:13.880]   And the eyes are essentially cameras.
[02:11:13.880 --> 02:11:16.360]   And you can look at your phone or a tablet
[02:11:16.360 --> 02:11:18.360]   and see who it is.
[02:11:18.360 --> 02:11:20.520]   Interact with them.
[02:11:20.520 --> 02:11:24.120]   It is looking at things like going in and doing nuclear waste
[02:11:24.120 --> 02:11:27.920]   cleanup, doing landmines, searching for landmines,
[02:11:27.920 --> 02:11:31.160]   using robots, things that we don't want to use humans for.
[02:11:31.160 --> 02:11:32.880]   But it's very, very basic.
[02:11:32.880 --> 02:11:35.480]   And it's a long way away from being
[02:11:35.480 --> 02:11:44.560]   something that can replace humans in jobs other than the most
[02:11:44.560 --> 02:11:45.600]   basic things.
[02:11:45.600 --> 02:11:47.920]   I mean, obviously some of the home helper thing
[02:11:47.920 --> 02:11:49.620]   would compete with somebody like a home health
[02:11:49.620 --> 02:11:51.660]   paid and that kind of thing.
[02:11:51.660 --> 02:11:58.260]   But only for people that need very little of the things
[02:11:58.260 --> 02:12:01.500]   that the health care.
[02:12:01.500 --> 02:12:03.980]   I love this unique hub that you were riding.
[02:12:03.980 --> 02:12:06.940]   This is also the Osmo technology, but it's a little cycle.
[02:12:06.940 --> 02:12:07.660]   It did.
[02:12:07.660 --> 02:12:09.620]   So out of the Osmo technology, they
[02:12:09.620 --> 02:12:12.100]   did a lot of research on how humans walk, right?
[02:12:12.100 --> 02:12:15.300]   To make this walk in humanoid robot.
[02:12:15.300 --> 02:12:16.780]   And so that two things came out of it.
[02:12:16.780 --> 02:12:19.300]   This device called walk assist, which is a belt that attaches.
[02:12:19.300 --> 02:12:20.540]   And then it attaches to your legs.
[02:12:20.540 --> 02:12:22.900]   And it helps people like they've had a stroke or that
[02:12:22.900 --> 02:12:25.140]   are somehow physically limited in walking.
[02:12:25.140 --> 02:12:26.700]   It helps them walk.
[02:12:26.700 --> 02:12:30.020]   And then also the uni-cub, which is a little device
[02:12:30.020 --> 02:12:33.300]   that you sit on and you sort of lean forward.
[02:12:33.300 --> 02:12:35.020]   And you can use the pedals.
[02:12:35.020 --> 02:12:36.340]   You can see my feet on a little bit.
[02:12:36.340 --> 02:12:37.820]   Just a little bit of pressure helps
[02:12:37.820 --> 02:12:39.940]   you kind of speed up or slow down.
[02:12:39.940 --> 02:12:43.580]   And then you lean to kind of steer and to direct yourself.
[02:12:43.580 --> 02:12:44.140]   It's kind of aiming.
[02:12:44.140 --> 02:12:45.100]   It's like a segue.
[02:12:45.100 --> 02:12:45.740]   Yeah.
[02:12:45.740 --> 02:12:46.660]   It is.
[02:12:46.660 --> 02:12:50.340]   It's like a much less expensive version of a segue.
[02:12:50.340 --> 02:12:51.980]   They're aiming them at things like airports.
[02:12:51.980 --> 02:12:53.260]   Yeah, there's the--
[02:12:53.260 --> 02:12:56.220]   you're pulling up on the screen now, the walk assist device.
[02:12:56.220 --> 02:12:57.020]   But the uni-cub is--
[02:12:57.020 --> 02:12:58.860]   It's like a little exoskeleton, almost.
[02:12:58.860 --> 02:13:01.100]   Yeah, it is totally an exoskeleton, exactly.
[02:13:01.100 --> 02:13:02.940]   And they eventually want to make it small enough
[02:13:02.940 --> 02:13:04.740]   so it could fit under your clothes
[02:13:04.740 --> 02:13:08.140]   and assist you in walking.
[02:13:08.140 --> 02:13:11.460]   That's going into clinical trials next year.
[02:13:11.460 --> 02:13:13.140]   So that's getting close.
[02:13:13.140 --> 02:13:16.300]   The uni-cub is something that they have at a science.
[02:13:16.300 --> 02:13:21.700]   And technology museum, they're testing it in Tokyo.
[02:13:21.700 --> 02:13:26.380]   And the uni-cub is aimed at things like airports and museums
[02:13:26.380 --> 02:13:30.060]   and wide open spaces where it is--
[02:13:30.060 --> 02:13:32.300]   if you are limited in your mobility,
[02:13:32.300 --> 02:13:34.780]   you might be limited in being able to walk.
[02:13:34.780 --> 02:13:36.900]   So they have taken this robotics research
[02:13:36.900 --> 02:13:39.460]   and done some very practical things with it
[02:13:39.460 --> 02:13:43.420]   in ways to help people today within the next five
[02:13:43.420 --> 02:13:44.260]   to 10 years.
[02:13:44.260 --> 02:13:46.580]   And so I tip my hat to them on that.
[02:13:46.580 --> 02:13:51.180]   Do you feel like this was personified that there was--
[02:13:51.180 --> 02:13:53.980]   obviously, you don't need really to make a robot with legs
[02:13:53.980 --> 02:13:57.460]   and able to walk or in a humanoid form at all.
[02:13:57.460 --> 02:14:00.140]   But they clearly want to do that so you're comfortable with it.
[02:14:00.140 --> 02:14:02.980]   Do you feel like-- I mean, did you feel like this was a thing,
[02:14:02.980 --> 02:14:05.540]   a human or a thing?
[02:14:05.540 --> 02:14:06.860]   It feels like a thing.
[02:14:06.860 --> 02:14:07.860]   Definitely feels like a thing.
[02:14:07.860 --> 02:14:08.700]   It does not feel like it's--
[02:14:08.700 --> 02:14:10.100]   It's not like a human.
[02:14:10.100 --> 02:14:12.940]   No, but they did particularly interestingly enough.
[02:14:12.940 --> 02:14:16.460]   You put the video up there or the photo up there
[02:14:16.460 --> 02:14:18.340]   of the different evolution of--
[02:14:18.340 --> 02:14:19.740]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:14:19.740 --> 02:14:22.500]   And you could see that they've actually shrunk him
[02:14:22.500 --> 02:14:24.500]   in the last few iterations.
[02:14:24.500 --> 02:14:26.660]   So he is now only four feet tall.
[02:14:26.660 --> 02:14:29.860]   And they said that is to make him so that he's not
[02:14:29.860 --> 02:14:32.460]   as intimidating to human beings.
[02:14:32.460 --> 02:14:34.860]   And so they purposefully have made him small
[02:14:34.860 --> 02:14:37.940]   so that he's not as scary, essentially.
[02:14:37.940 --> 02:14:41.140]   But originally, apparently, he looked like mascoteers.
[02:14:41.140 --> 02:14:42.940]   So no, no, that's the wrong picture.
[02:14:42.940 --> 02:14:44.580]   When?
[02:14:44.580 --> 02:14:48.460]   So there's a Disney land in Anaheim, California.
[02:14:48.460 --> 02:14:51.140]   Now, there's an Asamo exhibit where he sort of
[02:14:51.140 --> 02:14:52.420]   does a little performance.
[02:14:52.420 --> 02:14:54.260]   Asamo's a rock star in the gallery
[02:14:54.260 --> 02:14:56.860]   that I did there on Zee-Ding net that you're pulling the photos
[02:14:56.860 --> 02:14:57.420]   from.
[02:14:57.420 --> 02:15:00.180]   There's him shaking hands with the ruler to buy.
[02:15:00.180 --> 02:15:03.100]   And there's him all over the world
[02:15:03.100 --> 02:15:07.500]   doing performing for crowds and doing its thing.
[02:15:07.500 --> 02:15:08.740]   I shouldn't say he.
[02:15:08.740 --> 02:15:10.860]   They haven't said-- although the voice
[02:15:10.860 --> 02:15:13.780]   is a 15-year-old boy whose voice they--
[02:15:13.780 --> 02:15:14.780]   Oh, that's interesting.
[02:15:14.780 --> 02:15:15.820]   --for Asamo.
[02:15:15.820 --> 02:15:19.060]   But because the voice is high, it's kind of androgynous,
[02:15:19.060 --> 02:15:19.660]   you know?
[02:15:19.660 --> 02:15:20.180]   Yeah.
[02:15:20.180 --> 02:15:21.940]   And I've put purposefully so.
[02:15:21.940 --> 02:15:22.420]   And so--
[02:15:22.420 --> 02:15:22.940]   Well, asamo is--
[02:15:22.940 --> 02:15:24.140]   Well, no, I mean, he's threatening, I think,
[02:15:24.140 --> 02:15:24.940]   is what they're going for.
[02:15:24.940 --> 02:15:26.700]   And if you look at the early Asamo's,
[02:15:26.700 --> 02:15:28.140]   these are terrifying looking.
[02:15:28.140 --> 02:15:29.860]   I don't want to go anywhere near them.
[02:15:29.860 --> 02:15:30.860]   Yeah.
[02:15:30.860 --> 02:15:31.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:15:31.380 --> 02:15:32.580]   Oh, definitely.
[02:15:32.580 --> 02:15:33.500]   So yeah, the fourth--
[02:15:33.500 --> 02:15:36.380]   Asamo is very friendly looking.
[02:15:36.380 --> 02:15:40.180]   But it does-- you can tell that this is still, you know,
[02:15:40.180 --> 02:15:42.220]   essentially decades away, you know,
[02:15:42.220 --> 02:15:47.420]   from being something that we've seen in movies or that kind
[02:15:47.420 --> 02:15:48.580]   of thing.
[02:15:48.580 --> 02:15:50.180]   But obviously, decades in the grand scheme,
[02:15:50.180 --> 02:15:51.500]   I think, is not that far.
[02:15:51.500 --> 02:15:53.620]   Things happen fast as we've learned.
[02:15:53.620 --> 02:15:54.580]   It's funny about tech.
[02:15:54.580 --> 02:15:58.140]   It happens both faster and much more slowly than one expects.
[02:15:58.140 --> 02:16:00.740]   Well, in this case, Duhp was called the Grand Robaltix
[02:16:00.740 --> 02:16:02.500]   Challenge coming up in June.
[02:16:02.500 --> 02:16:02.980]   Yeah.
[02:16:02.980 --> 02:16:04.460]   Do you remember the original Grand Rob--
[02:16:04.460 --> 02:16:07.060]   It was like these cars could barely go five feet before
[02:16:07.060 --> 02:16:08.580]   driving off the road.
[02:16:08.580 --> 02:16:10.860]   Now cars have driven across the country completely
[02:16:10.860 --> 02:16:11.780]   autonomously.
[02:16:11.780 --> 02:16:13.980]   What's the grand challenge going to be this year?
[02:16:13.980 --> 02:16:16.940]   They've got six foot one robots--
[02:16:16.940 --> 02:16:17.980]   Oh, great.
[02:16:17.980 --> 02:16:21.860]   --whose job is to drive a car for humans to a crash site.
[02:16:21.860 --> 02:16:22.300]   Oh, my god.
[02:16:22.300 --> 02:16:23.500]   Break up on a door.
[02:16:23.500 --> 02:16:24.300]   Kill John Collet.
[02:16:24.300 --> 02:16:25.140]   No, no, no.
[02:16:25.140 --> 02:16:27.260]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:16:27.260 --> 02:16:27.900]   Turn off of--
[02:16:27.900 --> 02:16:29.980]   Come with me if you want to live.
[02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:31.300]   Yeah, punch the remote.
[02:16:31.300 --> 02:16:33.220]   Or a whole bunch of other stuff.
[02:16:33.220 --> 02:16:34.900]   The idea is that, you know, these
[02:16:34.900 --> 02:16:36.980]   are going to be rescue robots as an unterman agent.
[02:16:36.980 --> 02:16:37.980]   Yeah.
[02:16:37.980 --> 02:16:39.180]   Which are going to come out to us.
[02:16:39.180 --> 02:16:41.980]   But that's how they start.
[02:16:41.980 --> 02:16:44.420]   But as you said yourself, with the automotive challenge,
[02:16:44.420 --> 02:16:46.380]   that was a hilarious first attempt.
[02:16:46.380 --> 02:16:48.620]   And yet, they made great progress.
[02:16:48.620 --> 02:16:50.660]   They made it work very fast.
[02:16:50.660 --> 02:16:51.460]   Oh, it works.
[02:16:51.460 --> 02:16:52.580]   We could have it now.
[02:16:52.580 --> 02:16:53.940]   The problem is insurance.
[02:16:53.940 --> 02:16:58.340]   You know, is who pays--
[02:16:58.340 --> 02:17:01.580]   they have far fewer accidents than human beings, far fewer.
[02:17:01.580 --> 02:17:05.020]   But if there is an accident, who is liable--
[02:17:05.020 --> 02:17:06.020]   --the person.
[02:17:06.020 --> 02:17:06.540]   --the person.
[02:17:06.540 --> 02:17:07.220]   Exactly.
[02:17:07.220 --> 02:17:08.100]   Who pays?
[02:17:08.100 --> 02:17:11.020]   Is it the company that made the technology?
[02:17:11.020 --> 02:17:13.420]   Is it the person who owns it?
[02:17:13.420 --> 02:17:14.220]   Is it whatever?
[02:17:14.220 --> 02:17:16.380]   So this still has to get worked out.
[02:17:16.380 --> 02:17:20.700]   I mean, in Israel, these self-automated vehicles
[02:17:20.700 --> 02:17:23.540]   essentially are patrolling borders in Israel.
[02:17:23.540 --> 02:17:23.980]   Oh my gosh.
[02:17:23.980 --> 02:17:27.220]   They are very much real.
[02:17:27.220 --> 02:17:30.820]   And they are very much in use and fully capable.
[02:17:30.820 --> 02:17:36.740]   The one that the Ben Gurion University in Israel did,
[02:17:36.740 --> 02:17:39.340]   they're one of the ones that have won these robotics challenges
[02:17:39.340 --> 02:17:40.180]   in the past.
[02:17:40.180 --> 02:17:42.900]   And they have an SUV that can now--
[02:17:42.900 --> 02:17:45.860]   it's now smart enough that can handle four-way stops, which
[02:17:45.860 --> 02:17:48.500]   is something that's unique to the US.
[02:17:48.500 --> 02:17:52.260]   But it's one of the most difficult things to handle,
[02:17:52.260 --> 02:17:54.260]   because there's a little bit of unpredictability.
[02:17:54.260 --> 02:17:56.220]   Like, OK, who got there first?
[02:17:56.220 --> 02:17:58.180]   And can we tell, are you about to go?
[02:17:58.180 --> 02:17:59.020]   Or are you not?
[02:17:59.020 --> 02:18:03.060]   And it takes a little bit of finesse.
[02:18:03.060 --> 02:18:05.380]   And so they've gotten to the point
[02:18:05.380 --> 02:18:07.700]   that their vehicles can now even handle four-way stops.
[02:18:07.700 --> 02:18:09.740]   And so these things come all along all the way.
[02:18:09.740 --> 02:18:13.100]   I predict that videos like this of cars and robots
[02:18:13.100 --> 02:18:16.180]   failing miserably will become the most popular videos
[02:18:16.180 --> 02:18:17.740]   on YouTube's in the next five years,
[02:18:17.740 --> 02:18:21.460]   because it reassures us that there is nothing to fear.
[02:18:21.460 --> 02:18:23.380]   Nothing to fear, even though it's Jason.
[02:18:23.380 --> 02:18:24.660]   Because it's Jason that says, I mean,
[02:18:24.660 --> 02:18:26.580]   they're far safer than we are.
[02:18:26.580 --> 02:18:27.460]   I mean, frankly.
[02:18:27.460 --> 02:18:27.980]   Yeah.
[02:18:27.980 --> 02:18:29.460]   No, in fact, they know that.
[02:18:29.460 --> 02:18:31.420]   They're better in every respect.
[02:18:31.420 --> 02:18:33.140]   And we're just a cancer on the planet,
[02:18:33.140 --> 02:18:35.020]   and they should just get rid of us
[02:18:35.020 --> 02:18:38.300]   so that they can go on with their little robotic lives.
[02:18:38.300 --> 02:18:39.220]   This is true.
[02:18:39.220 --> 02:18:42.220]   Carbon-based life forms are so terrible for the planet.
[02:18:42.220 --> 02:18:43.700]   You're exactly right.
[02:18:43.700 --> 02:18:45.500]   Terrible.
[02:18:45.500 --> 02:18:46.580]   Oh, my God.
[02:18:46.580 --> 02:18:48.220]   Well, one day the singularity will come
[02:18:48.220 --> 02:18:49.540]   and we can all just upload ourselves.
[02:18:49.540 --> 02:18:50.540]   Thank you.
[02:18:50.540 --> 02:18:51.540]   That's true.
[02:18:51.540 --> 02:18:53.660]   I can't wait to be in a car.
[02:18:53.660 --> 02:18:58.660]   The brain of some taxi cab in 22nd century Chicago.
[02:18:58.660 --> 02:19:01.220]   You're in a Johnny cab.
[02:19:01.220 --> 02:19:03.660]   Christina Warren Mashable.com, great to have you.
[02:19:03.660 --> 02:19:07.220]   We love you at film_girl.
[02:19:07.220 --> 02:19:09.380]   I hope you get your watch some day.
[02:19:09.380 --> 02:19:10.580]   Yeah, me too. Me too.
[02:19:10.580 --> 02:19:11.580]   I will find a way.
[02:19:11.580 --> 02:19:13.660]   I mean, the worst case I wait,
[02:19:13.660 --> 02:19:14.900]   it's nothing to the world.
[02:19:14.900 --> 02:19:15.740]   It really is.
[02:19:15.740 --> 02:19:16.940]   Oh, yes it is.
[02:19:16.940 --> 02:19:17.780]   No.
[02:19:17.780 --> 02:19:19.540]   Worst things are happening out there.
[02:19:19.540 --> 02:19:21.060]   But I love you guys too,
[02:19:21.060 --> 02:19:23.380]   and I'm glad that you have your watch.
[02:19:23.380 --> 02:19:25.460]   Don't mess it up too much for Lisa otherwise she won.
[02:19:25.460 --> 02:19:26.300]   I know.
[02:19:26.300 --> 02:19:27.140]   This is her watch.
[02:19:27.140 --> 02:19:29.180]   Mine's coming.
[02:19:29.180 --> 02:19:30.020]   Thanks Ian Thompson.
[02:19:30.020 --> 02:19:31.060]   Always great to see you.
[02:19:31.060 --> 02:19:31.900]   Well, was really.
[02:19:31.900 --> 02:19:33.140]   I appreciate that you like to come in studio.
[02:19:33.140 --> 02:19:36.140]   We love you and the register.co.uk
[02:19:36.140 --> 02:19:38.420]   is where you'll find his writing.
[02:19:38.420 --> 02:19:42.940]   And next week, what bollocks and what was the other?
[02:19:42.940 --> 02:19:44.020]   What was the other?
[02:19:44.020 --> 02:19:44.860]   The other--
[02:19:44.860 --> 02:19:45.700]   Plonker.
[02:19:45.700 --> 02:19:46.540]   Plonker.
[02:19:46.540 --> 02:19:49.220]   We'll define those terms next week.
[02:19:49.220 --> 02:19:50.300]   Thank you, Jason Heiner.
[02:19:50.300 --> 02:19:53.340]   CBS Interactive @ Jason Heiner on Twitter.

[02:19:56.900 --> 02:19:59.460]   You wrote a great article about the launch of the new screensavers
[02:19:59.460 --> 02:20:00.300]   and I appreciate that.
[02:20:00.300 --> 02:20:02.460]   That helped get the word out.
[02:20:02.460 --> 02:20:03.540]   So I--
[02:20:03.540 --> 02:20:05.980]   You can see my book at followthegeeksbook.com.
[02:20:05.980 --> 02:20:06.740]   Oh, I forgot.
[02:20:06.740 --> 02:20:07.180]   Let's--
[02:20:07.180 --> 02:20:08.260]   The new chapter.
[02:20:08.260 --> 02:20:09.340]   We just released the new chapter.
[02:20:09.340 --> 02:20:10.220]   It came out.
[02:20:10.220 --> 02:20:10.820]   And it is--
[02:20:10.820 --> 02:20:11.900]   Yes.
[02:20:11.900 --> 02:20:12.900]   Tom-- who is it?
[02:20:12.900 --> 02:20:13.380]   Tom Merritt.

[02:20:15.300 --> 02:20:15.660]   Yes.
[02:20:15.660 --> 02:20:16.740]   Awesome.
[02:20:16.740 --> 02:20:17.500]   What is the site?
[02:20:17.500 --> 02:20:19.300]   Follow the Geeks book?
[02:20:19.300 --> 02:20:21.420]   Follow thegeeksbook.com.
[02:20:21.420 --> 02:20:22.580]   Yes.
[02:20:22.580 --> 02:20:24.060]   And it's all about Tom Merritt.
[02:20:24.060 --> 02:20:27.420]   We couldn't say that last week, but now we can.
[02:20:27.420 --> 02:20:29.580]   They're doing a chapter by chapter.
[02:20:29.580 --> 02:20:35.060]   Gina Trapani, Baratunde Thurston, some really great people.
[02:20:35.060 --> 02:20:39.140]   And then this week, you call him the podcaster.
[02:20:39.140 --> 02:20:39.900]   Tom Merritt.
[02:20:39.900 --> 02:20:41.220]   I love it.
[02:20:41.220 --> 02:20:42.860]   Always a dapper dude.
[02:20:42.860 --> 02:20:43.940]   Followthegeeksbook.com.
[02:20:43.940 --> 02:20:45.060]   And you can buy the book there too,
[02:20:45.060 --> 02:20:46.460]   but the chapter is fun.
[02:20:46.460 --> 02:20:49.820]   Let's watch the chapters come out month by month.
[02:20:49.820 --> 02:20:50.460]   You can pre-order.
[02:20:50.460 --> 02:20:50.820]   Yeah.

[02:20:51.820 --> 02:20:53.700]   The book pumps out the second half of the year,
[02:20:53.700 --> 02:20:56.420]   and we're releasing them as we finish the chapters.
[02:20:56.420 --> 02:20:59.420]   We're releasing them online and getting people's feedback.
[02:20:59.420 --> 02:21:02.340]   And the best comments, the best input,
[02:21:02.340 --> 02:21:06.460]   will actually going to include in the final version of the book.
[02:21:06.460 --> 02:21:07.460]   Good.
[02:21:07.460 --> 02:21:10.980]   Some of my favorite people in the first four chapters.
[02:21:10.980 --> 02:21:12.220]   So that's great.
[02:21:12.220 --> 02:21:12.860]   Thank you, Jason.
[02:21:12.860 --> 02:21:14.140]   Thank you everybody for being here.

[02:21:20.020 --> 02:21:21.700]   We'd love it if you'd watch live.

[02:21:38.300 --> 02:21:40.060]   out, five weeks out.
[02:21:40.060 --> 02:21:43.740]   But the old one's still usable, Twit.tv.
[02:21:43.740 --> 02:21:46.220]   Or go to iTunes or wherever you get your podcasts.
[02:21:46.220 --> 02:21:48.580]   And I know most of you have been listening on mobile now.
[02:21:48.580 --> 02:21:50.620]   We've got great apps on all the mobile platforms

[02:22:03.100 --> 02:22:07.900]   Don't forget T-Spring, twit.tv/twit.
[02:22:07.900 --> 02:22:10.260]   It's only a few more days left, couple of weeks left
[02:22:10.260 --> 02:22:11.300]   to buy that.
[02:22:11.300 --> 02:22:13.180]   Once what we do with these, they're limited edition.
[02:22:13.180 --> 02:22:15.020]   Once they're sold out, they're sold out.
[02:22:15.020 --> 02:22:18.980]   And this commemorates the 10th anniversary of the company.
[02:22:18.980 --> 02:22:21.340]   Not just the show, but the company.

[02:22:27.980 --> 02:22:28.980]   [APPLAUSE]
[02:22:28.980 --> 02:22:30.340]   There's only three people in place.
[02:22:30.340 --> 02:22:31.340]   Two people in Twit.
