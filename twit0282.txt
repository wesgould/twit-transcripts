[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   For a brand new year, 2011, and I thought,
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   given a brand new year, I'd bring in the three oldest farts I know.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   In fact, I believe combined, we've got between the three of us,
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   four of us, we've got 250 years of experience.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Starting in the lower right-hand corner, I'll do this in reverse.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Larry just observed that you have the three longest running technology
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   colonists in America who are still writing on the air right now,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   starting with Larry Maggid, who is at CBS News
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   and his website, LarrySworld.com.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Hey, Larry, good to see you.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Good to see you, Leo.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   You have never been on Twit before.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   I don't know how we managed that.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Only at CES when I'd run into you on the streets or the hallways.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   That's right.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   It's nice to be right here at home.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Well, this time we ran into each other at Google at their annual media party,
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   and you said, "When are you going to have me on Twit?"
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   And I said, "Next show."
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   So here it is.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Next year.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   And they are drugs, by the way, were quite good that time.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   They were.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Lots of beef.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   They were really good at eating us.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   And I'm really thrilled to have them on.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   We've been a big admirers.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   You know, I said a lot of kind things about him during the campaign.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, Barack Obama is joining us.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   I don't think --
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   His lips don't move.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Where'd you get that, John?
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   This is what -- this is part of the gift you sent me.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   You sent me this Feds that says "Twit" on it.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   And there's your MacBook Air.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   And then you sent me a Rock head.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Send me the head of Barack Obama.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   That's a great mask.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   It's one of the better ones.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   It's really good looking.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Where'd you get it?
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   We didn't send you that, John.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   I don't know where you got that, but we didn't send you that.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   I didn't send you a MacBook Air because as soon as --
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   If I sent you a MacBook Air, I'd have to send Jerry Pornella
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   MacBook Air, who's also joining us.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   And he officially qualifies as the longest --
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Jerry has Max.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Yeah, he doesn't need any more.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   In fact, he says he's on Windows today, and Jerry --
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   He ain't Windows.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Hey, Jerry.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Hi.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Great to have you.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Windows is all right once you figure out how it works,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   but it's just like going from Windows to Mac is always a little confusing.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   And with Max, everything is either very simple or it's utterly impossible.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   So you don't have to fight with it.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   You don't figure out how to do it.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   It just either just works or you give up.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Like that.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   That's very apt.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   With Windows, you keep fighting with it because eventually you'll get it.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Right.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   It'll capitulate at some point.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   Well, I'm thrilled to have the three of you on.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   All three of you I've been reading for years, and it's always fun.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   And I think there's kind of an opportune time to have you on because we're --
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   ComNEX is long gone, but the last standing big trade show is the Consumer Electronics Show.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   And it starts -- well, Thursday, the show floor opens,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   but the first press events, I think, are Tuesday.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Larry, I presume you're going.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   I'm on my way.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   I'm leaving Tuesday morning.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   You get no choice.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Jerry, Jerry is going.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   How long has it been since you've been to this?
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Oh, but I think before the radiation therapy back before the -- I don't think I have been
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   to a major show since the brain cancer.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   By the way, Jerry has written an autobiography, but it won't be published to 100 years after
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   his death.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   That's not true.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   I'm actually writing a book about the radiation therapy called the Mask on the Wall.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   And in fact, in a little bit, I'll go get the mask and show it to you.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   It's really a scary thing.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   That's what you wear when you're getting the radiation?
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   They pin your head down to a table with it so you can't move for obvious reasons
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   since they want to focus everything exactly properly.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   So I thought that would make a good title for a book about surviving brain cancer with
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   radiation as the mask on the wall.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   We've had you on since that, but just to recap all is well now?
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Yeah, you had me on since that, but my voice was in pretty awful shape.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   But Larry's part of the other night, Greg Benford, tells me I sound like the arassible old
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   curmudgeon that I always did.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   So your voice finally matches your writing style.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Don't it's back again.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   Yeah, it was at Nibin's party.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   But Larry, I haven't seen you in a long time, I think.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   It's been a while, Jerry.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   It's good to see.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   I see your son at CES and various events.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   In fact, I think we're going to see him at ShowStop, really.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   He's been on the oldie there as well.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Alex provides the web access for all of those shows, all of those PIP shows that they do.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   Is that what you call them, PIP shows?
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Oh, we used to call them PIP shows.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   That's a good name.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Oh, we used to call them.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   I didn't do that.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   I liked that name.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   So, yeah, Alex Cornell there last year.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   And he...
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Sheldon really hated them.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   I mean, Sheldon Edelman hated those little press shows like nothing you've ever seen.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   He tried to book every ballroom in Las Vegas to keep people from having them because they
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   competed with his Comdex.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Didn't work, but he sure spent a lot of money trying to stop them.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   You know, I don't know if I would go to CES if it weren't for those shows.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Those are the most efficient ways to see what's out there because he can walk around a ballroom
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   and have a little sushi or whatever, but mainly actually see products without being crowded.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   It's actually a positive.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   Oh, those things are packed, Larry.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   Come on.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Not comparing the four.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   Showstoppers and PIPCOM and of course you don't go to the end of the show.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   You don't go to these things without having lunch at Perinos.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   At my...
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   At my...
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   That's gone, by the way.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   Don't go to Peros.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   He's a hole in the ground.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Well...
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   That's not true.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Pat's having lunch at...
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Oh, you're right.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   You're right.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   Peros is still there.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   It's the club on the other side of it.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   The club on the other side, but Peros is there and Pat's having lunch there, I think.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   At least three days.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   Her soggy pasta.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   No, it's not.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   No, I think the...
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Whoa.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Oh, no.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   I love Pat.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   I think that's great and I think that event's great and I haven't been in ages, so I will
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   go over to Peros.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   You're not going, are you, Leo?
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   Yeah, I'm going now.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   To apologize to Pat.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Yeah, you might as well.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   So, John, you're not going to CES, right?
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   You don't do this stuff anymore.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   I'm actually going to go this time just as a...
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Why not?
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   Oh, good.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   You're kidding.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   So, we'll see you at PIPCOM.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   You know, I got to do something to make some extra money because all I got for my gift was
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   this head.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   And it looks good on Barney, the way.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   I think it looks good on Barney.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   It's great on Barney.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   And Jerry, we'll get you a FES.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   You were an oversight.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   I don't know how it could have happened.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   We will get you a FES.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   Make a note.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   The funny thing about...
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   I've known Jerry a long time and he's always saying that he wants...
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   He likes the idea of the FES look.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   No, he doesn't.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   But I think he would look good in a FES idea.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   Let's see.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   I don't have a FES.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   I have a...
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   That's good.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   What is that?
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   A hat from the Knights of St. George.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Oh, that's good.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   You keep wearing that.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   It's got that old, finished, crazy, finished lap.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   A plan hat?
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   It's called an adventure.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   No, it's...
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   DaVinci invented this hat, I think.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   It's kind of a muffin hat.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   Larry, Larry, you have anything you can put on?
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Let's see.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   I can grab that.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   I can grab that.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   To its show, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   Let's see.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   Now you don't want that.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   I was showing you, see guys out here.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   I can show you a picture of John de Vorac, though.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   1987.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   Wow.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   That's when John...
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   That's a long time.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   He looked like that.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   I remember when Maggie Cannon asked me if we should hire a guy named Jivorac for her magazine,
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   "God knows when" when I was a columnist for it.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   Now, Jerry, how did Vorac publish my first piece in "Infill World" in probably '82?
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   When you were editor of "Infill World" John, what did he have in your life?
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   '79, actually.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   What was that?
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   "Infill World" was in '79.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   I wrote an article.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.240]   My Feds is so big, we can't actually fit in the camera.
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.240]   We have to...
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.520]   That's not the same Feds that you gave us.
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.000]   No, this is the chief twit, Feds.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   Look, they have to pan all the way back to get that in.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.080]   All right, enough about Feds.
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:16.000]   Let's talk about CES, because that's not the biggest story of the week, but certainly
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   what's on our mind.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.440]   We're going to be going down there ourselves for wall-to-wall coverage as we did last year
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:27.520]   starting Wednesday with the digital experience event and then showstoppers and then all day
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:30.240]   Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:39.280]   Last year it was 3D TVs and E-ink display tablets, readers.
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.280]   Most of the 3D TVs came out.
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.720]   I guess what, Lee, very few of the readers came out.
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:43.720]   Yeah.
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.440]   This year we should see the readers lots of them.
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:47.640]   Yes, the same stuff.
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.640]   Only this time it'll be more product.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:57.160]   It's interesting because both Barnes and Noble and Amazon are saying that their respective
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:01.920]   e-readers, the Nook and the Kindle, are the best-selling products they've ever sold.
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:04.160]   Let me give you a story on that.
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:16.720]   My daughter who has got a doctorate in anthropology and archaeology wrote a story in the universe
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:22.360]   of the Moten God's Eye, which is the first novel Larry and I did together back in about
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:28.600]   '74 and it sold maybe 3 billion copies over the years.
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:36.920]   She put that up on Kindle and it's called Outies.
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:43.840]   She put that up on Kindle and on the Nook about two weeks ago now and it sold about
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.400]   a thousand copies already.
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.400]   Well, that's very good.
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.400]   That's interesting.
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:48.760]   Just there it was.
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:52.640]   And she's getting 70% royalties and I was looking at it.
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:12:00.560]   She has already got as much money from that as she would have got as an advance as a first
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.840]   novelist from a major publisher.
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:03.840]   Wow.
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:10.440]   Jerry, if you were starting over as a sci-fi author today, would you look at self-publishing
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:12.480]   in electronic form?
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:18.560]   Leo, I don't know, I got a letter from a reader who has got several nonfiction books
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:27.080]   in print so he knows how to write and who did a lot of words in fiction and threw them
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:31.120]   away until he got something he thought was worth doing.
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:38.240]   And he sent it to a major publisher and it's a year later and they haven't read it yet.
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:44.400]   And if you've got to wait for a year for people to read something, but in that time
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:48.360]   you could have earned as much as they're going to give you as an advance.
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.960]   So I guess the answer to that is I don't know.
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:54.600]   I never had to establish myself as a writer.
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:13:02.040]   I managed to have a friend named Robert Heinlein who read the first thing I wrote and liked
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:04.560]   it enough that he sent it to his agent.
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:09.080]   He also made me swear to never tell anybody that until after he was dead.
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:11.880]   See I told you there'd be an autobiography.
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.360]   Yeah.
[00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:19.600]   So this is very the way Audi's is available if you go to Amazon.com search for Audi's The
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.720]   Moten God's Eye.
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:24.000]   There is the there's the book 799.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.800]   Yeah, it's done with Larry and my permission.
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.880]   It's a story that it's an interesting story.
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:36.560]   It doesn't change the most universe much, but it's a good story.
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:42.120]   But the remarkable thing to me is how well it is sold in almost no time with almost
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.120]   no publicity.
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:46.920]   Well, some of that is of course how much people love The Moten God's Eye.
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:48.720]   I'm going to read it just because I love the story.
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:52.000]   I bet that sales will double after this show.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.680]   I'm not the idea that power of Leo LaPorte.
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:59.200]   As long as we're promoting books guys, go ahead.
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.200]   Go ahead.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.320]   So this is actually free.
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:06.240]   It's called Facebook for parents and it's on my fortune with that one.
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:07.240]   It's the parents.org.
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.600]   I don't know if you could bring up FB parents.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:14.520]   You've got a lot of stuff Larry for protecting kids online, which I really appreciate.
[00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:18.320]   I have used myself and referred to it many, many times.
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:23.480]   You did it for the missing kids site and safe kids.org and so forth.
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:25.480]   So this is continuing along our dot com.
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.880]   Yeah, this is this is part of Connect safely.
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:28.960]   I don't know if you can see the logo there.
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:29.960]   There you go.
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:35.880]   Connect safely.org is our website and parents guide to Facebook is gosh about 40 pages.
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:38.960]   We have to revise the online edition about every three hours.
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:44.280]   I bet Facebook keeps adding features, but this is up to date as of two days ago.
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.280]   I hate to write a book these days.
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:50.680]   I hate to write a tech book these days because stuff changes so fast, especially on if you're
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.720]   writing about websites, which could be changing.
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:53.720]   Right.
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:54.720]   Well, that's why I was thinking about Jerry.
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.840]   Jerry, what Jerry commented is I don't know if I ever want to write another printed book.
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:01.520]   We have a printed version of this we give out at events, but I think that it's all about
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:07.040]   online distribution is simply because print becomes history books much too quickly.
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.040]   Yeah.
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:09.040]   How about you, John?
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.160]   Do you still do you still do print books, don't you, John?
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.200]   You know, I haven't done a print book for a while, but I'm going to do on I'm going to
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.200]   go.
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.200]   I'm taking a different tact.
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.320]   I think online books are going to sell print books.
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:21.000]   Corey Doctorow says that.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.120]   I think Corey's dead on it.
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:27.440]   Corey is actually a kind of a pioneer with a lot of these ideas.
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.920]   And I believe it's true.
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:31.120]   And I'm basing it not just on him, of course.
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:38.960]   In fact, it was confirmed by my son who JC who has the big Kindle, the big one, and he
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.480]   has a lot of books on it.
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:43.720]   And by the way, he's got a bug in it to have to send it back.
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:45.440]   Anyway, he's got a lot of books on it.
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:50.040]   And he when he starts reading some of these books after he has it on the Kindle, he wants
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:52.680]   to buy the hardcover.
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:53.680]   He's weird.
[00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:55.480]   Yeah, no, I think that's true.
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:58.960]   But anyway, if you really like a book, you want to have it.
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:08.240]   That was sort of the reason why Dr. O and Eric Flint said that piracy probably helped
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.600]   sales.
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:13.560]   And maybe it was true back when there were not many sales of ebooks.
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:19.120]   But the thing was that a pirated e-book and they usually were not very well formatted
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:22.640]   and so forth would often cause people to go buy the print book.
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:23.840]   They'd have a printed copy of the book.
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:28.680]   And that's certainly the case, especially with people that nobody had heard of except
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:32.840]   from reading the ebooks.
[00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:38.600]   But I don't believe anybody ever bought an e-book as a result of getting a pirated e-book.
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.640]   Well, that's an interesting point.
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.360]   I buy almost all of my book.
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.480]   Now, if you're out selling hardbounds.
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.480]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:47.480]   That's right.
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:50.840]   And what I like about e-books is to spontaneity that I carry.
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:55.920]   I typically, the iPad, sometimes I'll even read a book on my Android, though not very
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:57.240]   often on my phone.
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:00.520]   But just the idea that I could carry around my entire library with me and I never know
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:01.600]   when I want to read.
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:05.080]   But here's the problem with Kindle books because I have started dozens of them.
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:06.240]   I've finished a few.
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:09.040]   I wind up buying books and reading them for a while.
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:12.160]   That's bad for you, Larry, but good for authors.
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.160]   It's great for authors.
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.160]   Yeah.
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.160]   No, I do the same thing.
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.160]   I do the same thing.
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.320]   But I've always done that with print books too.
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:18.320]   I often abandon books.
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:19.320]   Sure.
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:20.320]   I'm not sure.
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:21.320]   I've been reading it since I haven't in my pocket.
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:26.240]   I put it down, based down on a table, and it's still there.
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:29.720]   Ten years later when my wife tells me I've got to clean the room.
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:34.360]   I think if we pan around Jerry's library right now, we see a few books facedown.
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:37.880]   You really don't want to see my desk.
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:40.000]   We can kind of see it, Jerry.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   It's over there.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.200]   Oh, OK.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.200]   It's spilling over.
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.080]   I hate to tell you.
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.080]   Oh, my.
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.080]   It looks like that.
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:49.240]   Oh, my.
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:52.480]   If you're not watching on video, just you can imagine probably.
[00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:54.400]   That's on a good day.
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.320]   Jerry, you're a man of my heart.
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:03.000]   I think a disorderly library is a sign of an orderly mind or something.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   Right.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.040]   Somebody says Jerry's library is not that sort of nice.
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:09.080]   What the heck?
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:14.080]   Actually the Kindle made it onto almost everybody's list of the top products of 2010.
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.440]   I'll give you one list.
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:16.440]   This is from CNA.
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.840]   I'm sorry, from Wired, the Wired Gadget Lab.
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:22.400]   Number 10, Kindle 3.
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.760]   I put it in my top five, actually.
[00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:27.960]   Number 9, this is, I don't know, kind of, they have some odd ducks in here.
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:32.960]   The Canon S95 point and shoot, which is an excellent point and shoot, but not alone
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:33.960]   in the category.
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:36.400]   There's some other good ones like the LX5.
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:37.920]   Samsung Galaxy Tab.
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:41.760]   That's an Android 7-inch Android tablet, which I would agree with.
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.120]   I put it in my top five.
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.320]   I thought it was a very good product.
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.320]   Did you agree, Larry?
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.320]   Did you agree with the Galaxy?
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:50.440]   Yeah, I actually looked at it in Germany the day they announced it.
[00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:53.000]   I happened to be over at the C-bit show.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.520]   I thought it was, or EFA show, excuse me, I thought it was quite good.
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:00.720]   I'd first I was a little skeptical of the 7-inch form factor, but I think it has its
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:06.160]   place and I'm looking forward next year, this year, when Google finally comes out with
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:10.360]   an operating system that's optimized for tablets to seeing a lot of good products out
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:11.360]   there.
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:12.360]   I love Android.
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:13.360]   I'm a big fan of Android.
[00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.880]   I'm a fan of Android phone.
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.520]   Not quite as reliable as the iPhone.
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:22.480]   I think the iPhone is still a little more solid, but I love the openness of Android.
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:23.480]   Yeah, I would agree with you.
[00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:25.360]   I think the software is more mature.
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:26.520]   Number seven, the MacBook Air.
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:27.520]   I put that in my top five.
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.240]   In fact, that was my number one pick of the year.
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.760]   I just love the 11-inch MacBook Air.
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:32.920]   iPhone 4, number six.
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.400]   I missed that one.
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:35.400]   That one last one.
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.400]   What was it?
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:38.800]   The MacBook Air, John.
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.360]   I love it.
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.240]   Too bad you don't have one, John.
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:45.520]   You know, they're only $9.99.
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:46.520]   I have two.
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:50.200]   I'll tell you what, Jerry, I'll send you a visit.
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:52.160]   You'll send John your MacBook Air.
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.160]   No.
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:54.160]   No.
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.160]   Don't you think they're great?
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:56.160]   I have four kids.
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:01.040]   I don't have any problem disposing of things I'm no longer using.
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.080]   I have to say, I'm really loving the 11-inch here.
[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:04.360]   I did not expect it.
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:05.360]   What do you have, Larry?
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.080]   You have a camera you're holding up there.
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:09.080]   You were mentioning Compax.
[00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:12.000]   I bought the Nikon P7000.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.440]   7,000 also in that category.
[00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:14.440]   Yeah.
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:17.680]   Yeah, I bought it to bring to CES and it's got decent video.
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:23.920]   It's an SLR quality camera in a compact form factor that can kind of fit in my pocket.
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:27.720]   I really debated long and hard what to do because I'm really trying to fit in your
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:28.720]   pocket.
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:29.720]   What are you wearing?
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:30.720]   That's why I bought.
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.880]   I was looking at the same three, which is the LX5.
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.360]   I have an LX3 Panasonic.
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.880]   I love, I mean, it's a stellar camera.
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:41.280]   I mean, of course, I shoot a Canon 5D, but you need a pocket camera.
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:45.960]   I look at the S95 and the P7000 and because of compactness, I picked the S95.
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:48.760]   It's the only one you could just put in the front pocket there.
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:54.000]   But there's one thing and I think the three of us are old enough to remember these things.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.480]   They're called optical viewfinders.
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.480]   Oh, yeah, that.
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:58.960]   Anybody out there, you know what this is, guys?
[00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:02.160]   Of the three, that's the only one that's still in the front.
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.400]   It has a good optical viewfind.
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:07.000]   Of the three, I just mentioned, that's the only one that does.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.200]   And you can't find them on any of the consumer level cameras.
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:12.360]   They just don't exist anymore.
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.800]   And people think it's just because I'm an old fart and I'm in the habit of holding it.
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:16.800]   It's not that.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:20.800]   It's just that when you hold a camera like this, think about that your arms are unless
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:24.960]   you've got incredibly good stability, whereas if you hold it like this, you're bracing
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.560]   it up against your head.
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.920]   So it's just a much more stable way to take pictures.
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:29.920]   But I think I've lost that one.
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:32.680]   You also can't see that screen in a daytime.
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:33.680]   That's right.
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:34.680]   You're out of luck.
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:35.840]   But I think we've lost that word.
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:36.840]   It's over.
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:42.440]   I think the optical viewfinder will be, except on SLRs, will be extinct.
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:44.080]   Well, that's why I'm an SLR.
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:46.040]   You know, if I need that, I will use an SLR.
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:49.880]   Let me ask you though, I have lately come to the conclusion and you have three great
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:51.040]   people to ask this of.
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:54.160]   I'll start with you, Larry, that the camcorder is dead.
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:58.280]   Who needs a camcorder when you've got these point and shoot cameras that have high-def
[00:21:58.280 --> 00:21:59.280]   video in them?
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:03.000]   In fact, I wonder about the flip camera because I know it's getting, you know, it gets great
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:08.640]   reviews, but it seems kind of, you know, not really necessary because every point and
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:14.200]   shoot camera has video, every good smartphone has video and it's getting better and better.
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.200]   And I agree.
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:18.640]   I don't see a need for a camcorder for amateur use, obviously for professionals.
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.560]   You're always a video.
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:21.640]   But for your average either.
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:26.200]   And in fact, at CES, I plan to do some videos and I'm going to use, I've got a Kodak.
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:27.200]   I think it's the Z8.
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.200]   ZIA.
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.200]   Great.
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.200]   And the reason I like it is the microphone input.
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:32.200]   Yep.
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:33.440]   I'm kind of an audio bigot.
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:37.760]   I love your very nice, you guys sent me a headset, but I should prefer it.
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:38.760]   You didn't need that.
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:39.760]   You didn't need that.
[00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:40.760]   Good audio.
[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:41.760]   You're the last person.
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:42.760]   I don't know why we say a headset.
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:43.760]   You didn't have a headset.
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:44.760]   I just have this microphone.
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:49.480]   If they'd asked me, I would have said, "Oh, Larry's got a studio in his living room."
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:51.120]   But you sometimes have to use them on the road.
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:52.920]   If you ever have me again, I might be traveling.
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:53.920]   Keep it with you.
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:57.080]   John C. Devorak, you think the camcorder is dead?
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:59.080]   Well, yeah.
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:01.720]   I thought it was dead a couple of years ago.
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:05.820]   In fact, I thought it was dead once the Kodak came out with the little HD versions of it.
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:07.700]   But I even think those things are dead.
[00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:08.700]   Pocket camera.
[00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:09.700]   I think if you've got a smartphone.
[00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:10.700]   You've got a smartphone.
[00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:12.100]   The Kodak Z1A, I'm talking about the regular Kodak little camera.
[00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:13.100]   Oh, the camera.
[00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:14.100]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:17.920]   That takes an HD video, which does a great job.
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:20.240]   I still use a 1033, which is an old camera.
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.700]   You can get them for 65 bucks.
[00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:24.820]   It does a 720p, 16 by 9 HD video.
[00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:26.280]   And it's got a great microphone in it.
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:29.100]   And I'll tell you, I just went through all my cameras to see which one I'm going to take
[00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:30.620]   the CES to take videos with.
[00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:34.860]   And I pulled out that little flip cam from Kodak and of all the microphones and all the
[00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:37.080]   cameras that I use, that's got the worst one.
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:39.080]   I'd have to put a mic in it.
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:41.080]   And you can't do that.
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:46.220]   You know, actually speaking of which this week Kodak announced they're going to stop
[00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:47.720]   making Kodachrome.
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:48.720]   Yep.
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:49.720]   Yeah.
[00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:50.720]   Film is dead, folks.
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.560]   In case you didn't know.
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:53.560]   That's news.
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:54.560]   Yeah.
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:58.760]   Well, I think so that so there's a new camcorder out since you brought it up.
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:23:59.760]   Yes.
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:02.540]   And one of the top items I think came out in April.
[00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:05.100]   And I don't know if you've looked at it yet, but this Leo is something you should be looking
[00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:06.100]   at.
[00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:07.100]   Tell me.
[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:09.300]   Are you familiar with the Panasonic AGAF100?
[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:10.940]   No, AGAF100.
[00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:12.460]   I am not.
[00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:17.540]   It's a it's a hard solid state camera camcorder body, of course.
[00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:20.820]   And you it will take four thirds lenses, micro four thirds lenses.
[00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:23.580]   Oh, and I have a bunch of those because I have a bunch of them.
[00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:24.580]   Yeah.
[00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:25.580]   Yeah.
[00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:29.320]   Just looking at the specs of this thing, it looks just fantastic.
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:30.360]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:31.360]   Look at it.
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:33.680]   It looks like something you'd get from Ronco.
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:35.480]   I'm telling you, take a look at the specs.
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:36.480]   Look at it.
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:37.480]   It's got a handle on it.
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:38.480]   Okay.
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:39.480]   Lots of music.
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:41.400]   They say it's they say it's for professionals.
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:46.000]   I do have those lenses, which is not one of the reasons I like shooting with a DSLR is
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.920]   because you get great lenses.
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:49.520]   Right.
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:54.080]   And I've been waiting for a camera one of these cameras that takes regular, you know,
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:55.080]   good camera lenses.
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:57.820]   They don't need what do you have to buy camcorder lenses for these things.
[00:24:57.820 --> 00:24:58.820]   Well, that's a great idea.
[00:24:58.820 --> 00:24:59.820]   I am going to take a look at this.
[00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:01.340]   You use any old lenses.
[00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:03.140]   Leo, the pre digital lens.
[00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:07.540]   You know, I did when I bought the Olympus pen camera, the EP one.
[00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:08.540]   Yeah.
[00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:13.180]   And I bought an adapter for it and I went on to eBay and I bought a 50 millimeter lens
[00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:15.140]   for an OM one, which is a fact.
[00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:16.900]   I think I did the same thing.
[00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:17.900]   This is your idea.
[00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:19.500]   That's why I did it, John.
[00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:24.400]   But I have to say I was a little disappointed with the clarity of the old film lens.
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:25.400]   It wasn't very good.
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:26.400]   Now I don't know.
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:27.400]   Maybe the lens was moldy.
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:29.280]   Have you had good results, John?
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:32.480]   There's a couple of problems with getting one of those old OM one.
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:37.640]   There's about five different versions of that exact same lens and the one you wanted
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:38.640]   to get.
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:39.640]   Maybe you have it.
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:42.400]   Maybe you don't because I use that lens and I get extremely sharp pictures with it.
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.400]   That's what I was hoping for.
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.400]   And I was not.
[00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:51.060]   One, it's the version which came out late that on the inside black part in the inside,
[00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:54.780]   it says made in Japan very clearly at the bottom.
[00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:56.300]   That's the one lens that you want to grab.
[00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:58.140]   You want the one that's made.
[00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:00.340]   I'm dropping my lens in and you can shoot with it and see what you think.
[00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:04.660]   I'd be very curious because I got the OM one adapter so I can use any OM one lens, which
[00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:10.260]   was a classic Olympus film SLR, just a great camera.
[00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:11.260]   Yeah.
[00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:15.680]   And especially Nikon and Canon is the image stabilization is in the lens.
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:19.360]   So if you have an old lens, it'll work, but you won't get image stabilization.
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.960]   You would get auto focus or anything.
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:22.960]   Yeah.
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:29.740]   But Larry, with the Olympus bodies that Olympus that Leo's talking about has image stabilization
[00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:30.740]   at the mirror.
[00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:31.740]   Oh, not the mirror.
[00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:34.840]   I mean, at the sensor, it's inside the camera.
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:38.560]   So all these old lenses are image stabilized automatically.
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:39.560]   Interesting.
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:41.720]   And the Pentec does that as well if I'm not mistaken.
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:45.500]   I have a Pentec technology that was invented by the Knowles and I think they've been licensing
[00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:46.500]   it.
[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:47.500]   Yeah.
[00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:51.120]   The one I have uses double A batteries, which is another thing that's becoming extinct.
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.720]   It's hard to find cameras is double A battery.
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.040]   And that's nice for travel as well.
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:55.600]   So does that the which one is that?
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:56.600]   Is that the 7,000?
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:57.960]   It's the it's the cheap one.
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:00.960]   It's the KX, I believe.
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:03.880]   It's a very inexpensive camera that does the job.
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:05.840]   I can go get it in a second and show it to you.
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:09.040]   One of the things we're going to do this year is launch a new photography show because,
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:12.120]   frankly, there's a lot of photography shows for enthusiasts, but I want to do a show
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:16.720]   for people who just want to who want to up their game who want to, you know, because
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:18.440]   everybody has good cameras now.
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:19.440]   How much that?
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:21.640]   Yeah, I think it'll be a lot of fun.
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:26.640]   It's I'm the ultimate amateur user on the top of the youth camera.
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:28.200]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:29.200]   You know, what is it?
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.200]   What is an F stop?
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:35.840]   You know, I mean, really get get started composition, how to use an inexpensive camera
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.320]   and get great results.
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:38.320]   I'm very excited about this show.
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:43.360]   We're going to do it with Lisa Bettany, who's a great photographer and the host at her site
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:44.360]   is mostly Lisa.com.
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:51.560]   Her by the way, her iPhone app, which was banned by Apple because it modified the volume keys
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:52.840]   to make them a shutter button.
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:56.320]   So it was actually like a real phone is now back on the iPhone store.
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:00.520]   I don't understand exactly what happened and Lisa is not talking, but she's very happy
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:02.960]   that that camera plus applications back on.
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:03.960]   We're going to take a break.
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:04.960]   What a great crew we've got.
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.960]   Jerry Parnell is here.
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:07.960]   JerryParnell.com.
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:13.400]   He's still doing it after so many years, both as a great science fiction writer and as frankly
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:17.400]   the inspiration for everything I do with his chaos manner columns and bite magazine, you
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.280]   can still read the columns.
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:22.040]   Start at JerryParnell.com and move from there.
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:24.920]   It's great to have you on Jerry and you look good in that hat.
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:25.920]   Thank you.
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:27.120]   Yeah, I like it.
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:28.360]   John C. Devorak is here channel.
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:33.920]   Devorak John does so many things, including the great No Agenda program.
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:34.920]   You're not going to wait.
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:35.920]   No agenda program.
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:36.920]   Oh, I love doing it.
[00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:38.960]   You're not going to revive cranky geeks, are you, though?
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:41.040]   No, cranky geeks is dead.
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:42.040]   Sad.
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:43.040]   Oh, loved that.
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:46.120]   Oh, that show.
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:50.120]   Also for his first time, we have a virgin ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:51.720]   Pretty amazing at your age.
[00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:53.360]   Larry Maggid is here.
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:54.360]   Larry's world.com.
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:29:00.120]   You also hear them on CBS radio all the time and he'll be reporting for CBS from CES.
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.120]   Please come by.
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:02.280]   We're going to be in the South Hall.
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:03.680]   We've got a big table.
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:04.920]   We did the same place last time.
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.680]   It's right by the subwoofers.
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:12.000]   It's a great place to do a radio show.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   Have to run over.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.080]   What's funny is they have a demo that they do.
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:20.760]   This company, this subwoofer company has a demo that they do and they do it like every
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:21.760]   20 minutes.
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:25.240]   So every 20 minutes there's all this ruckus and then it stops and we've got 20 clean
[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:26.740]   minutes.
[00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:30.280]   We will be there thanks to the folks from Ford Motor Company.
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:35.040]   In fact, we're going to be interviewing Alan Malali, the CEO of Ford.
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:39.400]   Oh boy, I think early on Thursday, like 9 a.m. Thursday morning.
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:42.680]   So watch that live.twit.tv.
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:47.840]   We're going to, you know, he's an amazing fellow because not only is he, the guy who's
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:53.160]   taken one of America's great industrial companies and revitalized it in the 21st century, but
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:57.720]   he's also an engineer by training and by in spirit.
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:00.600]   He engineered the 777 cockpit when he was a Boeing.
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:03.000]   He's a brilliant guy, really interesting guy.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.520]   So we'll talk to Alan Malali.
[00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:10.440]   All of our coverage from the show floor at the, at our booth, but also we've got two
[00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:11.440]   live view cameras.
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:13.640]   We're going to be going all around the show floor.
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:16.600]   Tom Merritt will be joining me.
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:17.880]   Brian Brushwood will be there.
[00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:18.880]   Sarah Lane will be there.
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:19.880]   Becky Worley.
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:22.000]   In fact, Tom and Becky are going to do the digital experience event.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:27.160]   That's when our coverage begins Wednesday at 7 p.m. Pacific, 10 p.m. Eastern time and
[00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:28.960]   live.twit.tv.
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:31.680]   We thank Ford for making that possible of great Ford Sync.
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:34.240]   You know, I love the Ford Sync.
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:38.600]   Ford I imagine will have some significant announcements at CES last year.
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:44.640]   They announced the new My Ford Touch, which is kind of Sync Plus.
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:48.080]   You can make calls, play music and do so much more.
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:51.280]   My Ford Touch takes sync, which was already super cool.
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:55.760]   I have it in my Mustang and adds a big eight inch screen in the center console and two small
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:58.520]   screens behind your steering wheel.
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:00.680]   And then two five-way switch pads on the steering wheel.
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:02.280]   So you got three LCD screens total.
[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:06.960]   I mean, you are in, I think inspired by the 777 cockpit.
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:09.160]   You are totally in control of everything.
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:11.920]   And the point is you never take your hands off the wheel or your eyes off the road.
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:14.280]   So you're safe, but you've got hands free calling.
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:16.920]   I could say call Jerry Pournell at home if I had his number.
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:20.480]   I could say call Larry Maggot at work if I had his number.
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:21.960]   Nowadays, all I need is Skype.
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:25.880]   You could play music for most MP3 music players, including all the Apple devices works great
[00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:26.880]   with Windows Phone 7.
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:31.520]   In fact, on Windows Phone 7, it'll even read you your text messages when they come in in
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:33.920]   a lovely female robotic voice.
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:36.520]   You get personalized traffic alerts, personalized weather.
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:39.360]   You get movie times, gas prices.
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:43.800]   911 assist, which God hopes you don't going to be using.
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:47.760]   But if you ever, if the airbags are ever deployed, if you're ever in an accident, this
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:50.640]   is so cool, it automatically calls 911.
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:53.120]   You can cancel it if you say, wait a minute.
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:56.600]   But then it sends your GPS coordinates to 911.
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:59.040]   Plays a recorded message that gives you a chance to speak.
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:02.200]   I mean, that's a lovely safety feature.
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:08.120]   Take a look at my Ford Touch, the Ford Sync 10,000 commands and totally understands.
[00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:10.600]   Stay connected while keeping your eyes on the road and your hands on the wheel that
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:13.560]   your Ford Lincoln and Mercury dealers.
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:16.400]   And syncmyridepodcast.com is a place to go to find out more.
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:20.280]   And we do thank Ford so much for supporting our special coverage of CES.
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:22.640]   It's a very expensive enterprise.
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:25.320]   And we couldn't do it without sponsors like Ford.
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:32.880]   I remember a tech TV when we did Comdex and then later CES, it was roughly a million
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:39.160]   dollars each time between taking the staff down, the sat truck, the stage.
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:42.640]   And now we're doing it for pennies on the dollar.
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:46.720]   And I think in many ways, doing better coverage, to be honest with you.
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:50.480]   Well, that's because we didn't have boneheads telling us what to do.
[00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:53.600]   I'm glad you said that, but you're absolutely right.
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:56.600]   Hey, speaking of tech TV, one more note, and then we'll get back to the tech news.
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:59.360]   Our good friend, Erica Hill, you remember her, John?
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:01.600]   She just love Erica Hill.
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:03.880]   She's married to David Yount, who was our great floor director.
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:05.400]   They have a couple of kids.
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:08.120]   She left tech TV.
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:09.360]   I worked with her.
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:11.280]   I anchored with her during 911.
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:18.480]   I mean, she was originally on tech TV radio and then did news anchoring on tech live.
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:25.040]   She will be starting Monday morning as the anchor of the CBS morning news.
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:26.320]   So we're very proud of Erica.
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:27.320]   She's done very well.
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:30.160]   You probably saw her in CNN and CBS.
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:32.000]   Now she's actually got the big job.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.840]   I don't think there's a bigger job in TV except maybe anchoring nightly news.
[00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:36.560]   And I'm sure that's next.
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:39.000]   So congratulations, Erica.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.120]   Back to the tech news, Paul Allen is back.
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:44.400]   He got a little slap in the face.
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:50.840]   He has sued Google Apple, Facebook, saying that patents, that interval corporation.
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:55.560]   He again, this is a tech TV story because he, he owned tech TV when he was pouring money
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:58.280]   down the hole that was the interval corporation.
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:04.200]   He claims that patents that interval came up with have been infringed upon by Google's
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:11.160]   YouTube, by AOL, by Apple, by Yahoo, by Netflix, by eBay, by Office Depot, by Office Max on
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:12.160]   Staples.
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:16.640]   It sounds like the, the reindeer and the night before Christmas.
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:18.920]   The suit was originally thrown out for being too vague.
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:25.440]   The judge said, well, what exactly, what exactly are the infringing products?
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:34.160]   So Paul, who has lots of free time has refiled this time with many examples, including technologies
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:38.920]   that help websites suggest related content and headlines.
[00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:43.760]   Google news is one of the infringers, I guess.
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:45.960]   All we can say is good luck, Paul.
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:46.960]   Yeah.
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:47.960]   I'm sure he needs a little.
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:49.840]   So there's a story that I don't think is on your list.
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:50.840]   I want to bring it up.
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:51.840]   Bring it up.
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:55.280]   You know, this morning, you see, you said you brought up no agenda.
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:35:02.440]   Apparently, both Adam's iPhone four and then his, his fiance's and then a few others that
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:08.240]   we know of the alarm function on the iPhone for failed as of January 1st, 2011.
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:09.840]   Can't do it.
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:11.200]   It was it only rings once repeat.
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:13.600]   Is it, I think it's repeating alarms don't ring more than once.
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:14.800]   Is that it, John?
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:15.800]   I don't know.
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:16.800]   It didn't work at all.
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:17.800]   It took me four with the iPhone.
[00:35:17.800 --> 00:35:18.800]   It did.
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:19.800]   In Australia.
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:20.800]   I'm or yes.
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.680]   Well, yes, right.
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:24.160]   Down under.
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:25.960]   So what happened?
[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:26.960]   It's a bug.
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:31.600]   Well, why would it be a, but what would 2011 have to do with anything?
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:33.600]   The millennium, it's a millennium bug.
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:34.600]   It's a millennium bug.
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:35.600]   11 years late.
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:36.600]   Yes.
[00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:38.640]   That's what it is.
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.240]   It's the 2000 bug 11 years late.
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:42.680]   We knew it would happen.
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:45.720]   Finally, we thought this would be a big story and it finally is.
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:51.320]   Let me see if I can kind of get this story from the BBC.
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:52.560]   See what the exact story is.
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:54.720]   I think this is something Apple will fix pretty quickly.
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:55.880]   A glitch on Apple's iPhone.
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:56.880]   I'm sorry.
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:57.880]   It's a BBC.
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:36:02.640]   Apple's iPhone has stopped its built-in alarm clock from going off, leaving many people
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:05.920]   oversleeping on the first two days of the new year.
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:09.000]   That's my story and I'm sticking with it.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.800]   Angry bloggers and tweeters complained that they had been late for work.
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:18.240]   Apple has acknowledged the problem, says it will be fixed by tomorrow, January 3rd.
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:21.160]   Are they going to fix it?
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:23.160]   I'm sure they'll push a fix.
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:24.160]   Over to Europe.
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:25.160]   Eight.
[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:29.320]   That room is going to automatically fix itself tomorrow because it's basically some bug that
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:31.200]   has to do with the numbering.
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:32.200]   Yeah.
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.760]   It apparently only is January 1st.
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:35.520]   It's only January 1st to say.
[00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:36.520]   That doesn't work.
[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:40.320]   They've hired college to telephone everybody who put in for an alarm and didn't.
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:41.760]   It didn't go off.
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:45.520]   Apple's response, Natalie Harrison, said in a statement quoted by Macworld, "Customers
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:51.520]   can set recurring alarms for those dates, January 1st to 2nd, and all alarms will begin
[00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:53.640]   working properly beginning January 3rd."
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:59.200]   It was the non-repeating alarms that broke, but only on January 1st and 2nd.
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:00.200]   It's Sunday.
[00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:01.840]   I guess people are going to be late to church today.
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:04.440]   It's just a lame error.
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:06.040]   It's a holiday.
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:07.560]   Nobody should be waking up today anymore.
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:08.560]   I mentioned that the iPhone...
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:11.720]   I think the CEO should resign.
[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:13.200]   I mentioned that the iPhone...
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:14.360]   Good luck getting that one.
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:20.640]   The iPhone was on this CNN list of the top products of 2010.
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:22.880]   Do you agree that the iPhone 4 should be on that list?
[00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:24.640]   I did not put it on my list.
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:27.080]   Certainly consumer reports doesn't even recommend it.
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:31.520]   I think the iPhone 4 is a rare misstep for Apple.
[00:37:31.520 --> 00:37:32.840]   Agree disagree?
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:34.480]   I think it's an okay phone.
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:38.160]   I think it can't tanigate with way, way, way overblown.
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:44.280]   I don't think it's revolutionary, but I don't have any problem with it on the experience
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:45.280]   I've had with it.
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:48.240]   It doesn't work for me as a phone, so I can't even say it's an okay phone.
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:51.000]   I think it's a very good handheld computer.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:57.920]   Well, now is it the iPhone that doesn't work for you or is it the AT&T that doesn't work?
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:37:58.920]   It's pretty hard to tell.
[00:37:58.920 --> 00:37:59.920]   I think it's a mixture.
[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:03.400]   Now, I am in a bad AT&T area, but I have a Windows 7 phone.
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:07.200]   Is there anybody who is not in a bad AT&T area?
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:10.440]   Maybe that's the problem.
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:19.320]   My real dislike for iPhones to the extent that I have one is the bad area of business.
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:25.640]   If I can get on to a Wi-Fi on that, my iPhone is wonderful.
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:29.720]   But boy, I hate AT&T a lot.
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:35.080]   And of course, we are told that there may be a Verizon iPhone in a few days.
[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:39.280]   Bloomberg says soon, like in the next week, maybe tomorrow.
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:41.120]   I wonder if you're doing CES.
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:43.680]   That would be a bummer for people at CES.
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:47.680]   But there's a money allocated into buy and iPhone 4.
[00:38:47.680 --> 00:38:53.280]   By just waiting until they jailbreak me from AT&T, I think.
[00:38:53.280 --> 00:38:54.520]   Well, it's interesting.
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:58.140]   We don't know anything about the details of the contract or the exclusivity arrangement
[00:38:58.140 --> 00:38:59.300]   between AT&T and Apple.
[00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:00.360]   Nobody's revealed that.
[00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:03.560]   But maybe that deal did run out December 31.
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:11.120]   Apple has had a little history larry of letting the air out of CES the last few years by announcing
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:18.000]   the iPhone three years ago by announcing, well, not announcing the iPad, but preparing
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.520]   to announce the iPad shortly after CES last year.
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:24.000]   And of course, CES was all about imagining the iPad.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.600]   We didn't even know it was going to be called the iPad.
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:29.520]   Everybody was doing Islate at the time.
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:33.200]   I didn't get on a plane to fly from Las Vegas to San Francisco and back.
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:35.720]   But I know a number of my colleagues did.
[00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:39.920]   And it was the biggest story of CES three years ago was a product that was being introduced
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:40.920]   in San Francisco.
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:41.920]   Yep.
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:47.040]   And Bloomberg's positing that perhaps Apple will announce an event tomorrow the next day
[00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:50.840]   and encourage journalists on the way to Las Vegas to stop off in Cupertino.
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:52.200]   Oh my God.
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:53.200]   I don't.
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:54.920]   I think Bloomberg's wrong on that.
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:56.120]   But it could have.
[00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:58.040]   I haven't received anybody receive an invite yet.
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:00.520]   I think I'm the last guy Apple's going to invite.
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:02.880]   You know, you don't get any of the fights.
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:03.880]   I didn't get any.
[00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:07.720]   I am the absolute last guy that Apple is going to invite to anything.
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:09.080]   Now, why wouldn't they invite you?
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:11.320]   You just said you hated Windows, Jerry.
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:19.000]   Well, when the mark first came out back when you had to use a Lisa to program it, it was
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:23.080]   128 K memory and it was never going to be any different.
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:24.080]   Yep.
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:25.080]   You may remember.
[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:31.680]   Well, my lead story on it in bite was that it was a wonderful operating system attached
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:33.280]   to a toy computer.
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:34.680]   You were right.
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:41.040]   Well, I may have been right, but that did not endear me to the management at Apple.
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:46.040]   Later when the Pepsi guy came to Apple, they flooded chaos manner with Apple stuff.
[00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:51.400]   And when Heidi was director of development, I got along very well with Apple, but the old
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:54.720]   management is back and I don't think they like me much.
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:57.800]   You think Steve remembers?
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:40:59.080]   I am told he does.
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:00.080]   I don't know.
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:01.640]   I've only met him once.
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:07.640]   Well, maybe you and I, I'm on that list too, by the way, but only recently.
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:10.800]   I used to be funny how quickly they can turn on.
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:11.800]   Can I turn on your lead?
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:12.800]   I'm sure you're taking the hint.
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:16.480]   You've got to be like somebody who says, "Right, or I can't remember his name.
[00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:18.040]   He writes for one of the big newspapers.
[00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:21.600]   He just kisses the behind of Apple, never ending Lee."
[00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:22.600]   Yeah.
[00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:25.800]   And he's always getting everything for free, gets sneak peeks, the whole thing.
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:26.800]   You should do that.
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:27.800]   I should do that.
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:29.800]   Can you guys see this article from the early times?
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:30.800]   That's from MacIntosh.
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:32.880]   That's from the Macintosh for Shapes Up a Winner.
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:34.240]   Is that you, Larry?
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:36.600]   That was my review of the Mac and it started out.
[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:41.280]   I rarely get excited over a new computer, but Apple Computer Inks, Macintosh, officially
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:46.680]   introduced last Tuesday, has started a fever in Silicon Valley that's hard not to catch.
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:50.320]   And then I talked about the young Apple CEO, Steve Jobs, who showed it to me.
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:54.720]   I was blown away by it, although interesting enough, I don't use a Mac now.
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:56.520]   But you went wrong, man.
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:58.520]   And what the hell?
[00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:02.600]   At the time it was just amazing to me that you could do this incredible graphic stuff
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:03.880]   on this tiny little computer.
[00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:04.880]   I was pretty interested.
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:09.080]   I ran out and spent my own 2,500 bucks on the first Mac.
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:13.680]   Well, I had for early first Mac, I got to do anything almost immediately.
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:17.400]   I don't remember whether I bought it or bought it for me.
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:23.160]   But the problem was, I first got it and I thought, "This is wonderful.
[00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:24.840]   This is just terrific."
[00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:29.160]   And I started to do my letter column.
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:33.920]   In those days, my letter column was the accordion.
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:39.160]   If they had sold a lot of ads, then they needed editorial to fill in the pages.
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:41.400]   So I would answer a lot of--
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:43.400]   An effective trick.
[00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:44.400]   Yeah.
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:45.880]   Jeremy, can you give us a thousand words?
[00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:46.880]   We have to separate the ads.
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:47.880]   I was in hell.
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:54.080]   I don't remember one night getting a column saying, "We need 4,000 words by tomorrow morning."
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:55.400]   And I bet you did it.
[00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:56.400]   I did it.
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:58.360]   Well, Alex and I reviewed 10 books.
[00:42:58.360 --> 00:42:59.360]   There you go.
[00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:00.360]   And we did.
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:01.360]   And I answered them.
[00:43:01.360 --> 00:43:03.320]   But I answered a lot of the mail.
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:06.800]   The thing was, in those days, the mail was paper mail.
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:12.920]   And I had to type the mail in and type the answers in.
[00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:17.600]   And then I had a Mac printer, their printer, right?
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:20.280]   And it was only about 9,000 words.
[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:25.000]   And it turned out to take all night to print.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:31.280]   Because the Mac was using the same processor to do the print formatting and fooling and
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:35.800]   everything else on this 128K machine.
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:39.280]   And you just simply couldn't do any useful work with the Mac.
[00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:43.200]   It was a wonderful concept and a great operating system.
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:46.360]   But the early Mac was just a toy computer.
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:54.440]   Incidentally, Verizon does have a big announcement scheduled for Thursday, 1PM at CES.
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:44:00.400]   It could very well be Verizon making the announcement, not Steve.
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:02.280]   That makes a lot of sense, actually.
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:03.800]   And that would be probably a big story.
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:07.440]   But the funny thing is, and let's say come out with a different version of the hardware,
[00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:10.440]   which I expect, why would this be a big story?
[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:15.000]   The fact that another carrier picked up a phone, if anything besides an iPhone, it
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   wouldn't get anything.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   Yes, but it is an iPhone.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   It is a bad iPhone.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:23.840]   And iPhones are, I mean, for heaven's sake, the iPhone is close, the closest thing even
[00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:31.440]   now to the pocket computer that Niven and I described in Moton Jods Eye in 1974.
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:32.760]   That's true.
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:34.320]   It's a wonderful little gadget.
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:37.040]   Jerry, to use an Android or iPhone?
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:39.360]   I use an iPhone 3.
[00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:42.600]   I am supposed to get an iPhone 4.
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:45.800]   Well, don't bother because the iPhone 5 is going to be announced on Thursday.
[00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:51.520]   I never got around to the 4, and I guess I'll wait for the 5 because the 3 is good enough.
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:57.840]   I think the 3GS was probably better than the 4, but the 4's camera and screen are stunning.
[00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:59.760]   And that's a real reason to upgrade it.
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:02.560]   Just an amazing screen and a brilliant camera.
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:05.760]   And the apps that are out there for cameras are fantastic.
[00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:09.640]   But you've got to think that it's going to be a CDMA phone if Verizon has it.
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:13.680]   Maybe it'll have LTE, we don't know, but Verizon's certainly pushing LTE.
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:14.680]   That's an iPhone 5.
[00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:16.880]   That's not an iPhone 4 or a 4 plus.
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:20.840]   If they upgrade the hardware or the service, that would be very significant.
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:25.560]   By the way, I had the HTC Evo from the Android phone and the camera, even though it's an
[00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:27.440]   8 megapixel camera, it's not as good.
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:28.440]   It's not as good.
[00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:30.560]   It's nearly as good as the 5 megapixel iPhone camera.
[00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:32.080]   I have a Droid X.
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:34.800]   Same thing, 8 megapixel camera, not nearly as good.
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:41.240]   But the Nexus S, which is the most recent Android phone, the Google put out that's written by
[00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:47.680]   Samsung, actually has a very credible 5 megapixel camera that I think is the next best thing.
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:49.120]   Not as good as iPhone, but the next best thing.
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:50.920]   It's somewhere in this box of phones.
[00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:52.480]   You see this box of the phone.
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:54.480]   How do you get all of those?
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:58.360]   Jerry, you could have all that stuff.
[00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:01.200]   I probably could.
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:03.600]   This CES will be interesting.
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:07.640]   It's the first time I've gone around and showed the flag for a long time.
[00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:11.600]   It's also the first of those big shows where I have nothing to do.
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:14.000]   It's going around and see what's going on.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   Hey, Jerry, do you have something to do?
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.960]   Can you come to Showstoppers at Thursday night?
[00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:18.960]   I don't know Leo's going to be there.
[00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:19.960]   Oh, I'll be in Showstoppers.
[00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:20.960]   On a TV show.
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:23.680]   On a TVS booth, I would love to have you on my radio show.
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:24.680]   Sure.
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:25.680]   That's one thing I'd love you to.
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:27.320]   I'm going to book you too, Jerry.
[00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:28.480]   You said you'd be in the press room.
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:30.000]   We're going to go to the press room.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.560]   We're going to interview you too because we've got mobile cameras.
[00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:34.720]   You know what we're going to do at Showstoppers on Thursday night?
[00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:38.240]   Dick DiBartolo, Mad Magazine's Madis Director is going to be there too.
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:40.800]   We're going to go around and do five Gizwiz podcasts.
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:42.240]   We've got a lot going on.
[00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:47.320]   Now, somebody asked me, now this is the Samsung Focus, which by the way, is number four on
[00:46:47.320 --> 00:46:53.400]   the wired list right above the 4G Sprint Evo.
[00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:54.480]   They like this one better.
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:47:01.440]   This has a very similar form factor, the Nexus S, probably the same hardware, same camera.
[00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:04.040]   It's also a very good five megapixel camera in here.
[00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:08.440]   One thing that Microsoft did, which I like, is they really, not only did they put a camera
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:12.320]   button on there, but even if the phone is locked, without unlocking the phone, you press the
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:15.800]   camera button and it goes immediately to the camera and you're able to take a picture
[00:47:15.800 --> 00:47:16.800]   immediately.
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:17.800]   That's pretty nice.
[00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:22.840]   Has anybody ever had problems with their phone just not accepting touch?
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:24.960]   Like on my keyboard, what for a while?
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:25.960]   That's an Android issue.
[00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:26.960]   It doesn't accept my hands.
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:27.960]   Yeah, that's an Android.
[00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:29.240]   Very well known Android issue.
[00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:32.760]   I have no problems with this.
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:36.560]   The iPhone 3, except for AT&T.
[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:40.400]   As long as I've got Wi-Fi connection, this thing is wonderful.
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:42.760]   I can expand the text.
[00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:44.000]   I can read it.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.960]   I can, you know, bore people with things I looked up on the internet for out, who have
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:49.640]   been listening to them at dinner.
[00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:51.640]   I do that all the time.
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:54.800]   Yes, and it doesn't make your wife happy.
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:57.920]   Oh, she's, oh, I did it New Year's Eve.
[00:47:57.920 --> 00:47:59.320]   We're talking about a movie.
[00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:00.480]   We're saying, what was George Clooney?
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:01.480]   Oh, no.
[00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:03.200]   Anyway, I can't remember what it will.
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:08.920]   It was, what is the new part that Kevin Spacey's playing in some movies between Jack Abramoff
[00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:09.920]   and I didn't remember.
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:12.280]   And I'm Wikipediaing at dinner.
[00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:13.280]   Terrible.
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:14.280]   But I got the answer.
[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:15.280]   I got the answer.
[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:16.280]   That's the same thing at Niven's party.
[00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:17.280]   I love doing that.
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:18.280]   Dance.
[00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:19.280]   Dance.
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:20.280]   It's like having a pocket computer.
[00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:23.800]   I invented the damn thing and God's eye.
[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:25.960]   How about I have fun with it now?
[00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:28.360]   Well, Jerry, I'm going to tell my wife it's all your fault.
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:29.520]   The next time she complains.
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:31.000]   You're blaming Jerry's fault.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   Jerry invented it.
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.880]   I'm one of Jerry's kids.
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:37.640]   Number three on this list, I might as well continue.
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:38.920]   And I kind of agree with this.
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:40.280]   I put it in my top five.
[00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:42.560]   Microsoft Connect.
[00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:44.240]   I love the Connect.
[00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:48.280]   And I think more than just a game controller, I mean, it's not just like a Wii mo.
[00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:50.960]   It's going to, I think it's a new form of user interface.
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:52.920]   I think it's very interesting.
[00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:56.960]   You know, you think the Connect user interface will ever go from gaming to productivity that
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:57.960]   will ever see it in the office.
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:48:59.600]   I don't mean playing games, but the idea.
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:03.680]   Not until it's located to this in the office.
[00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:05.320]   And I don't anticipate that.
[00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:06.880]   But they're already doing that.
[00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:09.600]   The office with big flat touch screens.
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:15.320]   Well, you know, if you've played with the Connect, there is a UI for opening and closing
[00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:19.360]   things that's very much like a minority report where you slide things, you hold your hand
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:20.360]   up.
[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:22.680]   Or NCIS Los Angeles.
[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:23.680]   Yeah.
[00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:24.680]   And I kind of like that.
[00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:25.760]   I think there's something to be said for that.
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:28.200]   It also has voice control.
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:31.800]   What's I think significant about Connect is it's cheap.
[00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:33.920]   It's cheap for them to make.
[00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:35.520]   I mean, it's not, it's 150 bucks.
[00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:36.720]   It's not that cheap to buy.
[00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:40.720]   But I think it could be a very cheap component in a lot of new devices.
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:43.960]   So I'd give them some credit for a very important release.
[00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:50.200]   I just imagine Connect and Blu-ray and all of that built all in it with these with the
[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:53.000]   cameras that are available nowadays.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.440]   You can imagine a lot of interesting stuff with all that.
[00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:57.440]   Yeah.
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:01.200]   It'd be interesting to see this stuff just to see it.
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:06.480]   When I used to go to, you know, at Comdex for years, I gave that Best of Show award.
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:08.680]   I was the guy who handed it out.
[00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:11.960]   You'd tell them that I gave the award.
[00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:17.880]   It was of course actually done with 20 bite editors who were wonderful people and made
[00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:19.320]   me look great.
[00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:25.440]   But this first time I'm going to be there without having to give anybody an award or
[00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:28.000]   figure out what's better than what else.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:29.840]   Well, you already got two interviews booked.
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:32.560]   So I think you're going to be pretty popular there, Jerry.
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:33.560]   I have a feeling.
[00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:35.200]   Number two, I don't know what this is.
[00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:36.760]   Maybe you guys can help me.
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:40.920]   Berkeley Bionics, e-legs.
[00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:47.400]   I think that was the kind of the legs that helped to paraplegic walk, right?
[00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:48.760]   So you put these legs on.
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:52.240]   They're kind of like a game.
[00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:56.120]   What is the game, the mech games where you put on a suit, you put on these legs and you
[00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:58.920]   could actually walk and then they're $100,000.
[00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:00.000]   I wouldn't put it on the list.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.160]   I think it's an exoskeleton.
[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:02.160]   It's interesting.
[00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:05.440]   I'm not sure I put it on the list, but the number one item on the list I think has to
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:07.960]   be on everybody's top two or three.
[00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:09.760]   If not number one is the iPad, right?
[00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:10.760]   Of course.
[00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:12.280]   Big product of the year.
[00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:14.280]   Number one, John.
[00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:16.280]   You think they'll sell five million?
[00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:22.520]   Well, you know, if you just want to keep rubbing it in, I lost a bet on this.
[00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:25.280]   So I was a little off beat on or off base.
[00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:26.280]   No, you know what, John?
[00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:27.280]   It's done better than it ought to.
[00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:29.280]   You didn't think it was going to do that as well.
[00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:31.280]   I didn't think it was going to do as well as it did.
[00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:32.280]   It was an iffy bet.
[00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:33.280]   Yeah.
[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:36.520]   And of course, I would have probably if I had won the bet, I could have maybe even gotten
[00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:38.200]   an air book out of the deal.
[00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:39.520]   I would have given you an air.
[00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:40.920]   We'll make a new bet for 2011.
[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:41.920]   Sure.
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:44.440]   How many do you think they'll sell in 2011?
[00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:45.920]   Some of the analysts are saying 40.
[00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:49.040]   Let's say 45 million, something like that.
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:50.040]   Yeah, too many.
[00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:53.500]   You know, I was I was underwhelmed when I when the announcement came by went to the
[00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:54.500]   announcement in San Francisco.
[00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:57.760]   I think it was January and I wrote that I found it underwhelming.
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:01.160]   Then I got mine and started using it and I only use it as a consumption device.
[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:02.880]   I don't produce anything on it.
[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:03.880]   I don't write on it.
[00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:07.960]   I might do email, but I mostly watch Netflix movies and read Kindle books on it.
[00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:09.280]   And I love it.
[00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:11.520]   And I can't imagine not having an iPad anymore.
[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:15.640]   So doesn't surprise me after playing with it that it's done quite well.
[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:17.240]   Speculation on iPad too.
[00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:18.680]   Anybody want to care to?
[00:52:18.680 --> 00:52:24.320]   Well, let me second what Larry just said when I first got the iPad.
[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:26.520]   I didn't know whether I liked it or not.
[00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:29.600]   But I the ad is right.
[00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:33.880]   Do you remember those TV ads they had where they said you already know how to use it?
[00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:35.680]   Yeah, that was key.
[00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:37.240]   It turns out to be true.
[00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:38.240]   Like Larry.
[00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:39.840]   I don't want to produce on it much.
[00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:46.600]   Although you can a little bit with the keyboard, the Bluetooth keyboard, it makes it possible
[00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:49.560]   to write with it and write quite well actually.
[00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:53.800]   But I could I can't imagine living without an iPad now.
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:58.440]   I'm going to continue my contrarian streak and say that I'm bored with the iPad now.
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:52:59.440]   And when I found it.
[00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:02.880]   You're still in Kingdom for God's sake.
[00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:03.880]   Yeah, we rule.
[00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:04.880]   That's all I do.
[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:08.520]   And now a $500 we rule device.
[00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:14.880]   But you know what replaced it from your Kingdom because you're always busy.
[00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:17.000]   Somebody else has already got there first.
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   But I buy from you Jerry.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:24.920]   In fact, I tweeted it because I went to your bookstore and I received a novel by Jerry
[00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:30.080]   Pournell and it says that and I took a picture of it and tweeted it because I got a custom
[00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:31.080]   novel from Jerry Pournell.
[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:33.680]   Of course, it was in we rule.
[00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:38.480]   No, I found that I use the MacBook Air because in fact, I mostly want to create content.
[00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:40.400]   And so I want to keyboard.
[00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:42.680]   Although I notice I do keep touching the screen.
[00:53:42.680 --> 00:53:43.680]   The screen.
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:44.680]   By the way, my my preferred.
[00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:49.760]   What would you think of a MacBook that's had a 31.
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:52.000]   Which one over was that one?
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:55.720]   Yeah, that's a great that's a great computer.
[00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:58.360]   But again, the air Jerry, you asked an interesting question.
[00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:02.520]   And of course, Apple has already said my Steve Jobs already said, Oh, no, you don't want
[00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:05.120]   to touch screen in a laptop because he's arms length.
[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:06.120]   You don't.
[00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:07.400]   It's too hard to keep your arm up like that.
[00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:08.400]   Would you want us true?
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:11.960]   And as a matter of fact, these go you have to remember that the touchscreen laptops have
[00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:12.960]   been done before.
[00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:14.720]   Yeah, I got one in front of me right now.
[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:17.280]   They create a carpal tunnel syndrome among other problems.
[00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:20.000]   You'd be like Steve Martin in the jerk.
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:21.840]   You'd make all the money on that little handle.
[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:23.440]   Remember he put on the glasses?
[00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:27.240]   Made millions and then he got all the losses with the people who came out cross side because
[00:54:27.240 --> 00:54:29.480]   they had the handle on the glasses.
[00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:33.240]   Well, I, I, I have found.
[00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:35.800]   That's about as enough sure references you've ever done, Leo.
[00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:37.800]   I just saw the movie the other day.
[00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:44.440]   Years ago, I discovered and I still have a an HP tablet.
[00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:45.440]   I got one right here.
[00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:47.240]   Old, old windows tablet.
[00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:55.840]   Yeah, I mean it's an old XP tablet, but it's I found that one note and a stylist type tablet
[00:54:55.840 --> 00:54:58.880]   was the best research tool I ever had in my life.
[00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:04.040]   But Jerry, tell us why one note works so well for you.
[00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:07.520]   I don't know what just does because you told us because of your voice.
[00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:09.080]   You tell a story a million times.
[00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:11.560]   No, because it's his handwriting that they do.
[00:55:11.560 --> 00:55:15.440]   On the news, you get the lorded over everybody with your handwriting.
[00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:22.440]   Oh, it certainly does do handwriting recognition better for me than most people because.
[00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:23.880]   Should I tell that story again?
[00:55:23.880 --> 00:55:24.880]   Yeah, why not?
[00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:25.880]   It's well.
[00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:28.480]   And then we'll do a commercial.
[00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:29.880]   Actually, let me do a commercial.
[00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:34.520]   This is called a tease and then Jerry will explain why one note works better for him than
[00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:35.520]   any other human.
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:38.080]   Wait, Leo, let's get this correct.
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:42.280]   One note only works for Jerry.
[00:55:42.280 --> 00:55:45.800]   There's a reason and you'll find out what it is in just a moment before we do that though.
[00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:52.840]   I do want to talk about my friends at squarespace.com, the secret behind exceptional websites.
[00:55:52.840 --> 00:55:54.920]   We run our twit blog on there.
[00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:57.520]   I'll tell you, this is now it's hosting plus software.
[00:55:57.520 --> 00:56:02.240]   This is really the best way if you want to do a blog, a photo site.
[00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:08.080]   Pretty much any kind of website, squarespace.com makes it easy and it makes it beautiful.
[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:09.440]   I think that's key.
[00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:10.640]   Best of all, you could try it free.
[00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:13.640]   No credit card, no commitment for 14 days.
[00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:16.240]   Just go to squarespace.com/twit.
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:17.400]   Click that green button.
[00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:22.440]   All you'll have to do is provide a site name, a password, an email address in case you forget
[00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:26.120]   the password, they have a little capture there to keep robots from doing this.
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:29.360]   You've got a site for 14 days that you can do anything with.
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:32.600]   Where I would start is with these amazing templates.
[00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:37.440]   Squarespace lets you design sites like a designer without being a designer.
[00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:46.840]   You start with 60 plus professionally designed styles, gorgeous stuff, and then, and this
[00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:47.840]   is what I love.
[00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:49.040]   They really did something brilliant here.
[00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:54.840]   They use Ajax so you can literally drag and drop parts of it around.
[00:56:54.840 --> 00:57:00.320]   You can change column widths all without any coding, without any typing.
[00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:02.240]   You can completely customize this site.
[00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:07.400]   Now if you do know CSS and JavaScript, well, the sky is the limit, but you don't have to
[00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:08.400]   do a great site.
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:11.040]   What I want you to do, go to squarespace.com/twit.
[00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:15.760]   Click the examples button and see how different every squarespace site is.
[00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:17.760]   These are not cookie cutter sites.
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:19.200]   These are incredible sites.
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:21.200]   The photographers that use squarespace.
[00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:23.440]   These are people who care about design.
[00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:24.440]   This is their business.
[00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:27.200]   They need to look good to amazing things.
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:30.520]   Squarespace, of course, has a complete gallery setup.
[00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:36.280]   You've got forms, a wonderful iPhone app that not only lets you post content but also
[00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:37.720]   review comments.
[00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:39.480]   Look at stats.
[00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:40.480]   Did I say stats?
[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:42.280]   Look at the stats package on squarespace.
[00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:46.240]   You'll know more about your viewers, your users than anybody.
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:48.520]   The integration with all the social networking sites and more.
[00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:52.640]   It's all a great service, great software.
[00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:54.120]   I want you to try it free.
[00:57:54.120 --> 00:57:55.800]   Go to squarespace.com/twit.
[00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:56.800]   Set up your site.
[00:57:56.800 --> 00:58:01.800]   If you decide you want to use squarespace for your site, it starts at $12 a month.

[00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:28.240]   Jerry Pournell is here with John C. DeVorac, Larry Maggad.
[00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:31.880]   We're having a blast talking about the future.
[00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:35.040]   CES are all going to be there and the past.
[00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:39.280]   You've told this story before on TWIT, but it's well worth telling again, Jerry.
[00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:42.600]   Why is it that one note works so well for Jerry Pournell?
[00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:44.360]   Well, I'll make it quick.
[00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:51.160]   Back when it was still the Soviet Union, we went over there to Moscow and there was a
[00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:58.240]   guy named Stepan Peneubich who had a company called Paragraph and he was developing handwriting
[00:58:58.240 --> 00:59:00.360]   recognition.
[00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:07.000]   His problem was he didn't have any American handwriting to recognize.
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:16.920]   Well I took my logbook and he Xeroxed about 50 pages of my log, my old handbook, fountain
[00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:18.560]   pen logbook.
[00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:24.000]   Xeroxed about 50 pages and taught his program how to recognize that.
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:29.800]   The problem is I have the world's worst handwriting, so as far as I can see, microsauce my handwriting
[00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:32.120]   program recognizes mine.
[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:35.240]   If it won't recognize anybody else, that's not my problem.
[00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:37.800]   We all have to write like Jerry from now on.
[00:59:37.800 --> 00:59:38.800]   Isn't that great?
[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:41.640]   I actually think one note is a great product.
[00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:48.840]   It is, it's wonderful and one note with a good tablet is just the best darn research
[00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:51.920]   writing machine you'll ever get.
[00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:52.920]   I should.
[00:59:52.920 --> 01:00:02.520]   I think that we had something like the old, original HP laptop.
[01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:03.520]   You know.
[01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:04.520]   Hey Jerry, why are you doing that?
[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:06.240]   Would you move your microphone up a little bit?
[01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:10.200]   It's rubbing against your sweater and it sounds like you've got a ferret in there.
[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:11.200]   Okay, there you go.
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:12.200]   That's good.
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:13.200]   Yeah, I'm sorry.
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:19.160]   Yeah, you know the swing, swing.
[01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:23.040]   Yeah I have, but you know you had to use a stylus with it, which is one.
[01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:29.640]   Do you think, let me ask a question, should Apple, should Apple add handwriting to the
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:31.600]   iPad or to some other future device?
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:34.560]   The first one that's why they didn't do it in the first place.
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:35.560]   Wouldn't it be?
[01:00:35.560 --> 01:00:36.560]   It wasn't.
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:40.520]   The only thing worse than typing on a glass keyboard for me is handwriting.
[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:45.960]   I mean, I hand write it a fraction of the speed I type and I may have even worse handwriting
[01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:47.120]   than Jerry.
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:48.560]   So personally it wouldn't work for me.
[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:53.080]   I wouldn't want it, but I suppose there are people who would like to have their handwriting
[01:00:53.080 --> 01:00:54.080]   captured.
[01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:58.400]   I think good speech recognition would be an excellent product and if they could keep working
[01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:00.200]   on that, that would be helpful.
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:01.200]   You know, I had interesting conversation.
[01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:05.280]   Try to drag and natural with the iPhone.
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:10.440]   Yeah, it works very well and Google's speech recognition actually works quite well on Android.
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:11.440]   Excellent.
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:15.520]   I had a very good conversation with a guy named Michael Cohen who is one of the big scientists
[01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:18.000]   at Google for speech recognition.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:22.160]   And you know, I've seen some debate over speech recognition.
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:23.560]   Of course it turns out to be much hard.
[01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:25.480]   We always, I asked him, I said, when's it going to work?
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:29.560]   He says, well, about 20 years ago everybody said five years from now, about 10 years ago
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:31.000]   everybody said about five years from now.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.920]   If you ask me today, I'll say it's about five years from now.
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:38.320]   And he said the real problem is that for an engineer, five years from now means sometime
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:39.920]   in the future.
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:42.680]   It turns out to be much harder problem.
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:44.160]   Handwriting recognition is tough.
[01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:47.320]   Voice recognition is very, very difficult.
[01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:49.120]   And I asked him, I said, well, is it getting better?
[01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:52.960]   He said, yes, more memory space, better processors.
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:55.560]   It's not so much algorithms.
[01:01:55.560 --> 01:02:03.440]   There's a very famous quote from one of the researchers in speech recognition who said,
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:08.440]   the more linguists I fire from my team, the better my speech recognition gets.
[01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:11.920]   The reason being if you're trying to solve it by understanding it doesn't work.
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:14.280]   If you do it with brute force, it does seem to work.
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:17.080]   And on the Android phone, I'm with you on that.
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:19.520]   I find it works reasonably well.
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:22.640]   Again, it's never going to be 100% or at least not the next few years.
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:27.000]   But in terms of dialing numbers, looking up a restaurant, things like that, as long as
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000]   it's not too noisy, it tends to work pretty well.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.560]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:34.120]   I use it actually to dictate texts all the time.
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:35.120]   And it's great.
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:36.120]   And to--
[01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:37.400]   Yeah, the Android phone works very well.
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:41.880]   What you do is you talk into the phone, it makes a quick call to India.
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:42.880]   Somebody writes--
[01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:43.880]   This is to you.
[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:47.040]   And then they write it out as though something actually happened on a computer.
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:49.840]   There are some services I think that I ought to do does that.
[01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:50.840]   Jot used to do that.
[01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:52.440]   I don't know if Jot still does.
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:54.960]   And you're right, it would get much better results.
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:57.080]   But it's too slow.
[01:02:57.080 --> 01:03:01.280]   The Android phone, and as does Dragon Dictate on the Apple, does phone home.
[01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:04.400]   It sends it to the server that does the work and then sends back the text.
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:08.080]   It's not done on the phone at all on either case.
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:09.080]   All right.
[01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:11.240]   Which explains the brute force.
[01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:15.480]   That's how you get brute force out of the vise like you get a lot of horsepower.
[01:03:15.480 --> 01:03:19.400]   How did the old Dragon team do it?
[01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:23.760]   Oh, it's a great story and I don't remember it well enough to repeat it.
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:26.320]   But I'll find the blog post that talks about it.
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:27.320]   But the two guys--
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:29.280]   I'm a little PR girl.
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:31.360]   That Renee was her name.
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:32.360]   A Rekeo Blodgett.
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:33.360]   Or Blodgett, yes.
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:34.360]   Blodgett.
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:36.120]   She's still around, I just saw her the other day.
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:37.360]   She'll be at CES.
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:40.600]   She was one of my favorites.
[01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:48.960]   But they, every iteration of the Dragon program worked better than the last one.
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:53.760]   And I never have understood why that company didn't just make all the money in the world.
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:58.880]   No, you have to look into the history of the company called Learn Out and Housey.
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:03:59.880]   And Housey.
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:00.880]   And Housey.
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:01.880]   And Newhouse.
[01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:04.640]   There was some legal issue around that company.
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:05.640]   And they were called--
[01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:06.640]   I think somebody go to jail?
[01:04:06.640 --> 01:04:07.880]   I think what happened.
[01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:08.880]   Yes.
[01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:09.880]   But I think there was a whole.
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:10.880]   That was a scam.
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:15.440]   But I think what happened is a company-- I think they were called Scansoft at the time
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:17.720]   bought all three, right?
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:21.680]   The remnants of L&H bought Dragon, bought Nuance.
[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:23.480]   They renamed themselves Nuance.
[01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:26.320]   They killed the market by killing competition.
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:29.240]   And they didn't-- they-- I don't think they've made a lot of progress on any of those products
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:30.240]   since.
[01:04:30.240 --> 01:04:31.240]   Oh.
[01:04:31.240 --> 01:04:32.240]   Because there's nobody else doing it.
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:33.400]   And IBM was doing it.
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:34.840]   Remember, they stopped doing it.
[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:35.840]   Right.
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:39.840]   But for a while, every iteration of Dragon worked better.
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:40.840]   Yes.
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:43.240]   And it got right up to about 95%.
[01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:45.640]   Yeah, about 95%.
[01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:46.640]   About 95%.
[01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:53.800]   Now, in my case, it was no great tragedy because it turns out like Larry, I can type faster
[01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:54.800]   than I can write.
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:58.320]   And in fact, I can type faster than I can dictate.
[01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:06.480]   It's just that after this many years of doing this sort of thing, I'm used to writing on
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:10.320]   a keyboard and seeing it appear on a screen.
[01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:12.720]   And I can turn out text that faster.
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:14.800]   Faster than I can dictate it.
[01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:21.960]   Well, for a lot of people, dictation is the best way they have of getting text into.
[01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:28.440]   And I would prefer to dictate if I have to get something out of a book into the computer
[01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:34.080]   and I don't have a one scanner around, I would rather dictate it than have to type it.
[01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:35.080]   But--
[01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:39.440]   Well, I have a confession that probably only these three of you would even understand.
[01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:41.520]   One of my first word processing programs is Wordstar.
[01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:43.440]   And I don't know if you remember the Wordstar diamond.
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:47.480]   I'm looking at my keyboard, Control E was up, Control X was down.
[01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:50.480]   Well, I have my software program to emulate that.
[01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:53.480]   I still use Wordstar diamond.
[01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:57.560]   And I also steal the caps lock key, I've done my control key, it's been that way forever.
[01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:02.880]   And I can type about 40% faster that way than with a regular keyboard and much faster
[01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:08.400]   like Jerry with that keyboard than with my voice or certainly any other interface that
[01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:09.400]   I've seen send.
[01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:13.040]   So thank you Seymour Rubenstein for developing the Wordstar diamond.
[01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:16.200]   I'm willing to bet that all three of you guys still use dot commands.
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:20.920]   Jerry, didn't you have brief or something like that heavily customized to fit your--
[01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:22.400]   was it brief that you used?
[01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:31.560]   It was, well, I had to, as 100 days we used a thing called "Right" which was written by
[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:36.200]   Tony Peach and it was basically written for us.
[01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:41.440]   Because Tony was so paranoid about somebody stealing copies of his thing that he never
[01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:47.360]   forgot was able to market it properly which is demonstrate that if you're scared of being
[01:06:47.360 --> 01:06:51.040]   stolen from the simple way to do it is not have anything to steal.
[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:55.680]   That's a good-- that's the counter argument to publish, you know, get the pirate of the
[01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:57.320]   e-book because it'll sell more books.
[01:06:57.320 --> 01:06:58.320]   Yeah.
[01:06:58.320 --> 01:06:59.320]   That's the counter argument.
[01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:01.440]   Let me say something here before we go on.
[01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:02.440]   Please, John.
[01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:03.440]   First of all, I don't use dot commands.
[01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:07.160]   And if you're going to credit anybody with that diamond, you should probably credit Rob
[01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:10.240]   Barnaby, who's the guy who actually wrote Wordstar.
[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:12.120]   Seymour was just the front guy.
[01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:14.120]   He was the multi-level marketing guy.
[01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:16.120]   He was the top man.
[01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:19.360]   Well, Sam, or you can credit him with one thing that--
[01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:20.360]   Go ahead, then.
[01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:23.120]   So, they had an engineer at Wordstar.
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:24.120]   Charlie--
[01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:27.360]   Charlie is up the street from me.
[01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:28.360]   You're kidding.
[01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:33.280]   Charlie used to push Wordstar and he was the most credible guy they had on their team.
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:37.360]   And if you've talked to him right, if you wanted something out of Wordstar the next time
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:39.240]   you saw him, it would be in it.
[01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:41.760]   Yeah, well, that's true.
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:45.040]   Electric pencils, so many mentions, was the first word processor I used.
[01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:47.400]   What was the one that Captain Crunch wrote, then forced?
[01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:48.400]   Oh, the E.T. writer.
[01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:49.400]   I wrote the manual for that.
[01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:50.400]   E.T.
[01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:51.400]   That was easy.
[01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:52.400]   You wrote the manual for E.T.
[01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:53.400]   writer?
[01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:54.400]   Oh, my God.
[01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:56.400]   I do have a bunch of old-time rules on it.
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:57.400]   He's so--
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:58.400]   Oh, you're going to go get the manual.
[01:07:58.400 --> 01:07:59.400]   He's for clamps.
[01:07:59.400 --> 01:08:01.400]   He went off to get the manual in the full flush of enthusiasm.
[01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:05.080]   A little too enthusiastic for me, I might add.
[01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:06.480]   Look what I've got.
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:07.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:09.960]   The IBM version-- Look at that.
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:10.960]   The E.T.
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:11.960]   writer manual.
[01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:15.960]   And actually, the only time I think I've ever had a byline-- oops, I don't know.
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:16.960]   That's another one, though.
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:17.960]   Yeah, but this is the--
[01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:20.120]   Wow, I can't believe you have that, Larry.
[01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:21.120]   What do you got to--
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:22.120]   He shows up at his house.
[01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:23.120]   I wrote this.
[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:24.120]   He shows up at his house.
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:28.320]   In Kennedy One, my first job in the industry was to write the E.T. writer manual for the
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:29.320]   IBM PC.
[01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:30.320]   Wow.
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:32.880]   And I worked with Draper.
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:33.880]   Here we go.
[01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:34.880]   Can you see this?
[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:37.280]   You have to spend much time with Draper.
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:39.120]   Not too much time, Draper.
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:41.520]   Did he ever ask you to wrestle?
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:43.720]   Yes, he was crazy.
[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:46.000]   I was a very young man at the time.
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.520]   Well, Draper did ask me to wrestle.
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:49.520]   Me too.
[01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:50.520]   Draper was my rule.
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:53.080]   I got a million jokes and I got a million jokes and I got a million jokes and I got
[01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:54.080]   a million jokes and I got a million jokes and I got a million jokes.
[01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:55.080]   You don't have to make a joke.
[01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:56.080]   It's exactly what you think it is, John.
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:08:58.960]   There is no joke.
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:01.480]   That's just the way it was.
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:05.480]   Do I take it you didn't go in the back room?
[01:09:05.480 --> 01:09:06.480]   Whoa!
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:07.480]   No.
[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:10.400]   There was a room where the programmers worked and you didn't want to go there.
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:11.400]   I don't want to go there.
[01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:16.840]   And by the way, never light a cigarette anywhere near John Draper or he will wrestle you.
[01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:17.840]   He's dead now.
[01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:18.840]   Did Draper?
[01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:19.840]   No, no, no.
[01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:20.840]   I don't think he's dead, is he?
[01:09:20.840 --> 01:09:21.840]   No, he's lost.
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:22.840]   He's not.
[01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:23.840]   He's not a lot.
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:24.840]   He's alive.
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:25.840]   Oh, God.
[01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:27.840]   Look, he's had his challenges.
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:28.840]   Let's put it that way.
[01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:34.000]   John has had a lot of challenges mentally and I don't know what's going on with him now.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.960]   I know he's arrested at one point for reducing counterfeit bar tickets and I'm not sure
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:39.960]   what it's kind of say.
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:40.960]   Well, there was years and years ago.
[01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:45.320]   Yeah, but a long time ago he got his back broken in prison and he's never been kind
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:46.520]   of the same sense.
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:51.640]   But he was my roommate at a hackers convention once and I had no complaint.
[01:09:51.640 --> 01:09:53.560]   He was an interesting guy to talk to.
[01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:55.480]   Oh, I think he was quite interesting.
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:56.480]   He's brilliant.
[01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:57.480]   Yep.
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:00.000]   I think even to this day has been kind of his patron.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.800]   It keeps him, I think, stays in touch.
[01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:02.800]   I'll ask Waz.
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:03.800]   Oh, that's good.
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:05.000]   That would be actually was.
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.000]   That was a nice sentence.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000]   That's that conference I was at.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.000]   Yeah.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.000]   That would be good.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.000]   And that's just like Waz.
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.880]   Oh, Waz is a sweetie.
[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:16.920]   You know Waz is probably doing that for a lot of old timers in the industry.
[01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:17.920]   Yeah.
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:18.920]   Yeah.
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:19.920]   Let's move along.
[01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:21.280]   I would take a little break.
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:22.280]   We'll come back.
[01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:25.360]   I'd like, you know, gosh, we have such an esteemed panel here with Jerry Pournell and
[01:10:25.360 --> 01:10:26.360]   John C.
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:27.360]   Jerry Maggot.
[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:29.280]   I would love for you guys.
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:34.400]   I know I hate doing this and you probably do too, but maybe he's making some predictions.
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:38.880]   Maybe what we ought to do is get together at the end of CES and give an award.
[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:40.680]   There we go.
[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:41.680]   Now you're talking.
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:42.680]   You got it.
[01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:43.680]   All right.
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:44.680]   When you leave, when you leave.
[01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:49.000]   We have a court award for the best of show.
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:51.000]   And you will be a phez.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.000]   And I'm going to bring one.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.560]   No, you figure out what it is and John and I will present it jointly.
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:59.600]   A Macbook Air and John will never let it go.
[01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:01.200]   Hey, I know what I know.
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:02.720]   I know it'll be fun.
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:03.720]   No, this will be fun.
[01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:04.720]   I think we should do this.
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:06.280]   I'm off the Macbook Air thing.
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:07.280]   Did you get one?
[01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:08.280]   No.
[01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:09.280]   Do you want one?
[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:11.880]   What do you have an extra one laying around?
[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:13.440]   I'm going to bring one down for you, John.
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:15.040]   I feel really bad.
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:16.680]   I'm going to bring one down.
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:17.680]   If you come to CES.
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:19.200]   Do I have to give you a back to Obama mask?
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:21.720]   No, you can keep that and the phez.
[01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:23.960]   And when do you leave, Jerry?
[01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:24.960]   How long are you going to be there?
[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:26.240]   You're going to be there through Sunday?
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:29.840]   I'm going out Monday and leaving Saturday.
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:30.840]   You're leaving Saturday.
[01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:31.840]   I'm leaving Saturday.
[01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:32.840]   Saturday?
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:34.360]   And Larry, are you leaving Saturday?
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:35.360]   Yeah, I'm leaving Saturday.
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:38.960]   I'm going to be moderating an event Saturday morning and then taking off after that.
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:40.600]   Oh, you're leaving Saturday morning?
[01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:41.600]   No, no, no.
[01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:42.600]   I take off in the afternoon.
[01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:43.600]   We could do something around noon.
[01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:47.040]   I'm doing the radio show 11 to 2.
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:49.240]   That's got the biggest audience, a million people.
[01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:50.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:51.240]   So we're going to do three.
[01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:53.320]   Come over to the South Hall at noon.
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:55.320]   Eileen, make a note of this.
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:59.960]   And we will do the first annual because I like being big.
[01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:02.800]   The first annual, I don't know what we're going to call it.
[01:12:02.800 --> 01:12:04.640]   Well, let's look at the initials we've got here.
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:09.240]   We've got a P, we've got a D, we've got an L, we've got an M.
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:10.240]   Well, that's so good.
[01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:12.240]   The first ever Pudlam Awards.
[01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:13.240]   That stinks.
[01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:15.240]   No, there's no doubt.
[01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:18.040]   And we've got a couple days to figure it out.
[01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:20.720]   They're criteria going to be because everybody's got awards out there.
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:22.080]   We have to come up with agreement.
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:23.080]   So we just agree.
[01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:26.280]   It's like all editorial staff should get together and you say, what do you think?
[01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:28.360]   And we all agree on something and give them an award.
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:29.360]   Yeah.
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:30.360]   That's the criteria.
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:42.560]   And for the awards, it's a convex was innovation, impact on the industry, and way cool.
[01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:44.360]   And then they just threw it all out and said, what do we think?
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:49.560]   We do those three factors and sort of talked it out until we came up with something that
[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:56.040]   we agreed was innovative, would have a real impact on the industry and was way cool.
[01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:59.800]   And that was the basic basis of the Biden awards.
[01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:04.040]   And I guess those awards were probably the most famous of the Comdex Awards.
[01:13:04.040 --> 01:13:05.040]   Oh, yes, absolutely.
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:07.040]   I know we're going to call it.
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:08.640]   I got a name.
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:11.160]   We're going to and everybody's got a consonant.
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:12.160]   There's all kinds of stuff.
[01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:14.160]   You have the JJL awards.
[01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:17.240]   JJLL, how about if we call them the Ophas?
[01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:18.240]   What do you think?
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:20.760]   The Ophas, the Old Fart Award.
[01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:23.360]   Yeah, that's a possibility.
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:25.560]   You want an OFA?
[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:26.800]   And we don't tell anybody what it means.
[01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:33.240]   I don't really want to make it something that anybody would be worried about receiving
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:37.040]   because he couldn't tell in polite society what they have.
[01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:38.040]   What did I get?
[01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:39.040]   I got an OFA.
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:42.680]   And we don't have to explain it.
[01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:51.560]   OFA, I think, 12 noon Saturday, the OFA to be named later awards will be awarded live
[01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:57.200]   on live.tv and to the world on the Premier Radio Networks.
[01:13:57.200 --> 01:13:58.680]   And I know, Jerry, you listen to the show.
[01:13:58.680 --> 01:13:59.680]   Thank you.
[01:13:59.680 --> 01:14:00.680]   Yes.
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:01.680]   So we'll do that.
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:02.680]   That'll be great.
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:05.840]   If you can make it to the South Hall, we'll send you an email and we'll do that.
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:08.120]   And we will pick our best award.
[01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:10.080]   How about the OPA Awards?
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:12.360]   The Gray Hair Awards.
[01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:15.040]   The Geezers Award.
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:16.600]   Chatroom is being mean right now.
[01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:17.600]   That's all I can say.
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:18.600]   The Fast Grand Masters Award.
[01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:19.600]   Yes.
[01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:24.080]   Though I, you know, that maybe something with gold in the word, you know, the Masters.
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:26.240]   Yeah, the Masters Award.
[01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:28.680]   They'll give them a red jacket.
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:30.760]   Well, take a break.
[01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:31.760]   We're going to come back.
[01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:35.080]   I would like to hear what you think 2011 is going to bring us.
[01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:37.760]   We've got lots of, it goes John.
[01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:39.720]   John put, you can do this too, guys, if you wish.
[01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:41.520]   Larry has taken off completely.
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:43.760]   John likes to put up like a piece of paper or something.
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:44.760]   What does it say this time, John?
[01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:46.760]   What does it say anything?
[01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:47.760]   All right.
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:52.020]   And, you know, I think if you would just move the camera and focus on our president who
[01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:58.320]   seems unusually gleeful, we can just leave it at that.
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:03.280]   How about the cow awards, the cranky old writers, writers, writers awards?
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:04.280]   Cranky writers.
[01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:06.960]   Cranky old writers.
[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:07.960]   Saving.
[01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:08.960]   Oh goodness.
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:10.840]   Brynn is just sent us an email.
[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:17.040]   Johnny John Draper has had surgery recently, has some medical issues and savingcaptaincrunch.com
[01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:18.840]   is the website.
[01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:20.840]   And Jerry, you're holding up your iPad.
[01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:21.840]   What was that?
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:25.120]   That's my kingdom, of course.
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:26.120]   We rule.
[01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:28.080]   How about we call it the We Rule Awards?
[01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:29.560]   Yeah, all right.
[01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:30.720]   It's not bad.
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:31.720]   We do rule.
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:32.960]   So there, crunch time.
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:35.720]   Actually, look at this picture of John.
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:36.720]   Wow.
[01:15:36.720 --> 01:15:37.720]   Wow.
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:40.000]   He invented the blue box.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.800]   They called him Captain Crunch because he discovered that a 2600 Hertz tone could be
[01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:48.960]   used to reprogram the phone system and created blue boxes.
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:53.920]   And that's actually how Wozniak and Steve Jobs got to know him because they built and
[01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:57.160]   sold blue boxes before Apple Computer.
[01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:02.520]   It was rather ironic that AT&T put him in jail and IBM hired him indirectly to write
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:05.320]   the software, the first word processor for the IBM PC.
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:09.720]   I mean, he went from the enemy of one corporation to the servant of another.
[01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:14.760]   And then, unfortunately, we haven't heard a lot of stuff about him in recent years.
[01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:17.120]   He went in for a fairly serious back surgery.
[01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:18.120]   This site raised money.
[01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:19.760]   He went in December 21.
[01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:23.360]   I don't see an update.
[01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:26.760]   They did raise the $10,000 they needed, which is great.
[01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:32.600]   And I don't see an update on his status after the surgery, but it looks like there were
[01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:34.640]   quite a few vertebrae.
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:38.880]   I guess that's from the injury in prison that you talked about.
[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:41.600]   He always had a bad back all the time.
[01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:42.600]   I knew him anyway.
[01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:44.520]   I remember that.
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:54.080]   It says an anterior cervical discectomy, cervical 567 thoracic one and arthrodesis something.
[01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:56.440]   That sounds like pretty serious stuff.
[01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:59.200]   So I apologize for...
[01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:02.760]   He's got to be about my age, isn't he?
[01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:05.920]   I don't know if he's quite that old, right?
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:06.920]   I don't know.
[01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:08.440]   Nobody's coming quite right.
[01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:11.040]   I'm not going to ask the guess, but I don't know.
[01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:12.600]   That's an interesting question.
[01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:13.600]   I don't know.
[01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:16.800]   Anyway, we wish you the best, John.
[01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:23.240]   Moving along, let me talk a little bit about our friends at Citrix, a name I know you know
[01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:24.240]   well.
[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:28.720]   All these folks know Ed Yakubuchi, the guy who started Citrix many moons ago.
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:38.520]   He was actually an IBM programmer who was loaned to Microsoft and basically wrote the NT kernel.
[01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:39.520]   This kind of the old...
[01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:42.600]   I'll ask Jerry about that because I bet he knows some of that story.
[01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:48.660]   The old story was that Microsoft wrote OS2 for IBM in effect by lending programmers
[01:17:48.660 --> 01:17:53.840]   to IBM and IBM lent programmers to Microsoft and they wrote NT and who got the better of
[01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:54.840]   that deal.
[01:17:54.840 --> 01:17:59.640]   The good news was Fred Yakubuchi as he knew NT's internals better than anybody and was
[01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:05.640]   able to write the best remote access code, the code that he then licensed back to Microsoft.
[01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:06.640]   Citrix is still a...
[01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:11.680]   He doesn't own it anymore, but it's still a very well-known name in remote access.
[01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:16.120]   If you do enterprise remote access of any kind, Citrix is what you'll be using.
[01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:20.760]   They also have consumer products based on the same reliable, secure, fast remote access
[01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:24.800]   backbone, including one I use all the time called GoToAssistExpress.
[01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:28.160]   Now if you're an IT, if you're in a support situation, you've got software you need to
[01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:32.760]   support, GoToAssistExpress is incredible.
[01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:34.560]   It's exactly what you're looking for.
[01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:36.680]   First of all, works on Mac or PC.
[01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:40.200]   You install it on your system when you've got a support ticket, when you've got somebody
[01:18:40.200 --> 01:18:44.800]   you need to help, could be family, friends, could be colleagues, could be your job.
[01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:47.800]   You can send them a link or you can send it to the site 30 seconds later.
[01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:51.400]   They've got the software and it's running and you're in fixing their system.
[01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:54.800]   And then on, you have the ability to do unattended support.
[01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:57.640]   You can also, and I love this, do eight sessions at once.
[01:18:57.640 --> 01:19:01.600]   That means you can start an install on one, a scan on another, a fix on a third, and keep
[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:02.600]   going.
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:06.560]   That makes you much more productive, much more productive.
[01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:09.800]   You can handle more support requests more quickly, increase your revenue.
[01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:13.320]   Of course, you eliminate the travel, which really is nice, and you spend a lot less
[01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:15.680]   time on the phone, which I know you're going to love.
[01:19:15.680 --> 01:19:17.280]   I want you to try it free for 30 days.
[01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:20.440]   If you're in the support profession, or maybe you just have a lot of family and friends
[01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:24.680]   you help out, go to assist.com/twits, a place to go.
[01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:27.200]   G-O-T-O-Assist.com/twit.
[01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:33.040]   128-bit SSL encryption, 24/7 support for you.
[01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:35.920]   You couldn't find a better product for getting this job done.
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:37.040]   And I know I've tried them all.
[01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:39.840]   Go to assist.com/leo.
[01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:42.200]   We thank them for their support of this week in tech.
[01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:44.000]   You remember Ed Yakobuchi, right?
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.960]   Jerry, of course you do.
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:46.960]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:47.960]   Great guy.
[01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:52.600]   I think he didn't he do, isn't he doing a time share for jets or something like that,
[01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:53.800]   net jet or something like that?
[01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:55.080]   I don't think he does that anymore.
[01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:56.080]   Is he out of that too?
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:57.080]   I don't know.
[01:19:57.080 --> 01:19:58.080]   I don't think so.
[01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:00.120]   I used to party with him at Comdex.
[01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:01.120]   He was a guy.
[01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:05.200]   Gina Smith introduced me to him, and he knew how to party.
[01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:07.920]   By the way, I should ask you about this, Jerry.
[01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:11.320]   Gina is going back to CES.
[01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:15.240]   She's going to cover it for a new version of bite.
[01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:16.640]   Have you heard about that?
[01:20:16.640 --> 01:20:20.880]   I only the rumors that same rumors you've heard.
[01:20:20.880 --> 01:20:24.120]   They have not talked to me about doing anything for them.
[01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:27.040]   I don't know what they're doing.
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:28.040]   It's true.
[01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:33.000]   I talked, I corresponded with Gina, and they are revivingbite.com, reviving it, I should
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.400]   say, and reviving it.
[01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:38.440]   I believe it's going to be launching somewhere around March or April, and Gina will be the
[01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:39.440]   editor in chief.
[01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:41.080]   And who really good for her?
[01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:42.080]   Yeah.
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:43.880]   Yeah, so Jerry, I'm sure they'd love to have you back.
[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:44.880]   I'm sure they'd love to have you back.
[01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:46.640]   I should talk to me, I guess.
[01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:50.760]   There's a name, Chaos Man or something like that.
[01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:51.760]   Yeah, there it is.
[01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:53.880]   If you go to bite.com.
[01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:55.200]   And who else is involved with this?
[01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:56.760]   It's a UBM production.
[01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:59.280]   I've heard some other names involved with this.
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:00.280]   But good for Gina.
[01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:01.960]   In fact, we should get her on the show.
[01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:06.280]   Gina used to do a radio show years and years ago.
[01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:08.080]   I used to be on that show regularly.
[01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:10.400]   Yeah, what was the name of that show?
[01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:11.400]   I can't even remember.
[01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:13.520]   It's called the Vorac on computers.
[01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:14.520]   John left.
[01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:17.440]   And then we had to take the name of the Vorac off.
[01:21:17.440 --> 01:21:19.280]   So we called it on computers.
[01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:23.520]   I had been reading Gina Smith in print.
[01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:25.040]   And on a while here, I called her.
[01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:26.040]   She never called me back.
[01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:27.680]   She said she was too nervous.
[01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:30.560]   Her husband, Henry, made her call me back.
[01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:31.560]   We put her on.
[01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:32.560]   She was great.
[01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:33.560]   She was a star.
[01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:37.240]   She immediately as often happens with the people I work with surpassed me and is now
[01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:38.480]   went to ABC.
[01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:40.600]   Was there tech correspondent for a long time?
[01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:43.840]   Larry Ellison hired her for Think Nick.
[01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:44.840]   Remember that?
[01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:49.360]   His ill-fated cloud computing network computer initiative.
[01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:56.640]   She was the editor in chief at E2 Electronic Entertainment magazine founded the E3 conference.
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:22:00.760]   She was the co-author of my first book, which we both wanted to call.
[01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:03.360]   How do I get the dog here out of the disk drive?
[01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:08.720]   But got bowled to some lame 101 computer answers you need to know.
[01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:10.800]   Terrible name.
[01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:14.440]   She says Kim Commando came out with a book exactly the same time, a thousand and one
[01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:16.520]   computer answers you need to know.
[01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:18.040]   So which you going to buy?
[01:22:18.040 --> 01:22:20.000]   A hundred, a thousand.
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:25.600]   She also was, you want to say ghosted, but I think really co-wrote was is bio.
[01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:26.600]   I was.
[01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:28.560]   That's the last thing she did.
[01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:30.560]   So I keep trying to get her on Twitch.
[01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:33.160]   And I forgot Leo of your involvement with that show.
[01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:34.160]   That's absolutely right.
[01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:35.160]   On computers.
[01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:36.160]   On computers.
[01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:37.160]   John started it.
[01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:38.520]   Well, if you get a hold of her, tell her how to get a hold of me.
[01:22:38.520 --> 01:22:39.520]   I will.
[01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:40.520]   Yeah.
[01:22:40.520 --> 01:22:41.520]   She's going to be at CES.
[01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:42.520]   Oh, God.
[01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:43.520]   She should join.
[01:22:43.520 --> 01:22:44.520]   Wait a minute.
[01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:47.800]   Does adding an S John help our name for these awards?
[01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:52.760]   Because it could be the Pournell de Vorac, Maggad Smith, LaPorte Awards.
[01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:55.200]   At least it puts a little gender balance in it.
[01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:56.200]   Nothing else.
[01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:57.200]   Yeah, I know it.
[01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:58.200]   Great.
[01:22:58.200 --> 01:22:59.200]   I will, I will contact Gina.
[01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:04.560]   She should be part of this, especially since, you know, Bite Magazine and Jerry come on.
[01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:06.240]   They got to call you.
[01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:08.520]   You can't have a Bite Magazine without chaos manner.
[01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:12.720]   Well, that was kind of my theory on the subject, but they haven't talked to me.
[01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:14.760]   It's all I can tell you.
[01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:15.760]   I will.
[01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:19.120]   I presume they know how to get hold of me, assuming they have the old Bite records.
[01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:21.960]   I haven't changed my phone number since 1968.
[01:23:21.960 --> 01:23:22.960]   So.
[01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:24.560]   Hillies, that's true.
[01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:25.560]   Yeah.
[01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:26.560]   Wow.
[01:23:26.560 --> 01:23:27.560]   That's pretty impressive.
[01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:28.560]   Does it have two letters in front of it?
[01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:29.560]   Like if it's eight or five angles?
[01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:30.560]   Yes, it's five thousand.
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:31.560]   Yeah.
[01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:34.200]   When I first got this number, it had two letters in front of it.
[01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:35.560]   Can you say what these change was?
[01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:36.680]   I know what you looked, Jerry.
[01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:41.200]   You lived not far from where I grew up, and we had a state number, ST, something or other.
[01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:42.200]   Yeah.
[01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:45.760]   I think it was a, no, that was a little east of here.
[01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:50.160]   Harlan Ellison has a state number to this day, actually.
[01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:52.320]   But I've, mine's.
[01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:54.400]   You might have a triangle.
[01:23:54.400 --> 01:23:55.400]   Seven, six.
[01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:56.440]   I can't remember what I would do.
[01:23:56.440 --> 01:24:00.320]   I think we need to go retro, and everybody needs to look at the first two, you know, there's
[01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:04.000]   about most, I would say 90% of the people listening have no idea what any of you were
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:05.000]   talking about.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.000]   That's right.
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:09.640]   I think we need to go back and figure out what the first two digits of your seven digit
[01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:15.960]   phone number are and find an abbreviation by Pennsylvania six, five thousand.
[01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:16.960]   What the hell happened there, John?
[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:18.360]   Did you, or is that Larry?
[01:24:18.360 --> 01:24:19.360]   Oh, that's Larry.
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:24.200]   He's going to show us, oh, ladies and gentlemen, now for the kids watching today, in the old
[01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:28.680]   days of telephony, you had to rent your phone from the phone company.
[01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:30.640]   They had a division called Western Electric.
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:33.240]   And not, you guys recognize this, right?
[01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:36.400]   Not only did you have to rent a phone, but you had a dial the phone.
[01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:37.400]   Yeah.
[01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:41.360]   Yeah, you actually had a dial that I bet you there are people watching this show that
[01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:45.120]   have never seen a dial, dial phone.
[01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:47.360]   John's just, I'm not.
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:51.560]   That's why they call it dial tone to this day.
[01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:54.760]   People still say dial the phone, but I don't think my kids know what that, where that the
[01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:55.760]   genesis of dial.
[01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:57.760]   Talk about dial tone.
[01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:58.760]   Yeah.
[01:24:58.760 --> 01:24:59.760]   Well, can you help the phone?
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:00.760]   You get a dial tone.
[01:25:00.760 --> 01:25:01.760]   Sure.
[01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:03.760]   Yeah, where's the send button on this?
[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:06.840]   I can't quite figure out how to turn it off.
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:07.840]   I don't know.
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:08.840]   What are you doing?
[01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:09.840]   I could, wait a minute.
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:13.080]   I got to ask you, Larry, why do you have a Western electric dial phone there?
[01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:16.440]   Well, probably for nostalgia, but at one end, it is Western electric.
[01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:17.440]   You're absolutely right.
[01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:21.360]   At one point, I used to take these apart and I would put audio jacks in them.
[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:22.360]   Oh, that's what I did.
[01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:24.720]   So I could do radio interviews before I had all the fancy equipment.
[01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:25.720]   Sure.
[01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:26.720]   Yes.
[01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:27.720]   Sure.
[01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:28.720]   Yeah.
[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:33.360]   And really an old one, but black hard rubber one, you know, and there's a cell phone built
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:34.360]   into it.
[01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:35.360]   Bakelite.
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:36.360]   Bakelite.
[01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:37.360]   That's right.
[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:38.360]   Oh, yes.
[01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:39.360]   Yeah.
[01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:40.360]   And there's a cell phone.
[01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:41.360]   You pick, I think, keek sells them.
[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:44.160]   You pick it up and you dial it and it somehow connects to the cell phone and makes the call.
[01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:45.160]   He will, he will sit at the table.
[01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:48.800]   I'm going on a cruise with him in about a month and he'll sit at the table with his
[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:54.040]   big black phone and it'll ring.
[01:25:54.040 --> 01:26:01.200]   He gave me a big old black handset, which is a Bluetooth connector to my Apple phone,
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:02.440]   but I don't use it much.
[01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:03.920]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:10.480]   So any predictions, guys, either for CES or for the year ahead, are we going to see 800
[01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:11.480]   iPad clones?
[01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:15.080]   Will somebody do one that actually can succeed?
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:16.080]   Are we?
[01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:17.400]   Yeah, I brought a prop.
[01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:18.400]   It's a pillbox.
[01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:20.800]   It's all about tablets.
[01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:23.040]   And we're going to see a gazillion tablets.
[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:24.040]   Yes.
[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:26.280]   Most of them will be fairly crappy, I suspect.
[01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:29.160]   And a lot of them will be Android.
[01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:31.600]   Beyond that, we'll see a lot more of the thing.
[01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:36.080]   I just wrote an article that's on the front page of the Huffington Post tech section,
[01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:40.600]   which is my wish that things slow down a little bit, that we don't just see so many
[01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:45.200]   products come out that once again, we're just overwhelmed and inundated with a lot of crap.
[01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:48.800]   Does that just show how old you are, Larry?
[01:26:48.800 --> 01:26:49.800]   No.
[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:53.400]   I don't actually, the funny thing you say that, you know, I have young kids, our kids in their
[01:26:53.400 --> 01:26:58.800]   early 20s, and they're not only a little less tech savvy than I am, but even less interested
[01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:01.800]   that I am on every single gadget that comes out.
[01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:02.800]   Well, I'll trade you that.
[01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:03.800]   Yeah.
[01:27:03.800 --> 01:27:05.560]   When you talk to my kids, couldn't hear less.
[01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:06.560]   Yeah.
[01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:07.560]   Yeah.
[01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:08.560]   They're happy.
[01:27:08.560 --> 01:27:09.560]   My son's got a Nexus one.
[01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:11.680]   He's not craving the Nexus S. He's happy with it.
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:12.680]   We are in a bubble.
[01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:14.680]   There's no question about that.
[01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:23.080]   Well, as I've been saying for years, we've got to the point where Moore's law ran way
[01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:29.360]   ahead of the concepts with the hardware is capable of things and the software is not
[01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:30.320]   caught up with it.
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:35.320]   So we've got the equipment to do a lot of things that just don't happen.
[01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:36.320]   Yeah.
[01:27:36.320 --> 01:27:39.360]   And I think also, and we talked about this earlier about handwriting recognition and speech
[01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:44.480]   recognition, I think user interface is skilled to one territory that we have a lot of work
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:45.480]   to do.
[01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:48.840]   Obviously, Apple has done incredible work in that area, but we're making devices smaller
[01:27:48.840 --> 01:27:53.320]   and smaller, more and more powerful, but we still are limited by how we get information
[01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:55.560]   in and out, especially in.
[01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:59.920]   And I would like to see some breakthrough in terms of user interface.
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:01.320]   Mm.
[01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:05.920]   And in terms of bandwidth, aren't we really throttled, especially as we move to mobile
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:07.520]   by the lack of bandwidth?
[01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:08.520]   Absolutely.
[01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:13.360]   In fact, even some of the four G phones are not giving us the kind of bandwidth you
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:14.360]   need.
[01:28:14.360 --> 01:28:19.440]   If you're really going to be moving an incredible number of bits around with video, I just think
[01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:20.720]   we have a long way to go.
[01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:24.600]   And of course, as you know, Leo and the rest of you, you get out of the US, you get over
[01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:28.840]   to Korea and some other countries and where Piker is compared to what some of the Asian
[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:30.680]   countries have.
[01:28:30.680 --> 01:28:32.680]   Yeah.
[01:28:32.680 --> 01:28:37.440]   A couple of transitions as Newsweek used to call them.
[01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:48.160]   There was a guy who used to promote his website by publishing fake death notices for celebrities
[01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:50.000]   on Twitter.
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.000]   He's dead now.
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.000]   Okay.
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:53.000]   Just mentioning it.
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:54.000]   I don't know.
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:55.000]   That could be karma.
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.440]   He just passed away.
[01:28:56.440 --> 01:29:06.920]   I can has said triple X dot triple X dead at least till the end of this year.
[01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:12.680]   My space got to be putting that on the death watch list.
[01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:18.160]   According to business on cider.com, my space is planning to fire half of its staff.
[01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:20.720]   There's only 1,100 people still in my space.
[01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:24.800]   Rupert Murdoch has for a while now been rumored to be wondering what the hell do I do with
[01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:26.040]   this thing that I bought?
[01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:27.040]   Yeah.
[01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:34.280]   Does anybody really know how my space founded so badly compared to the market share it used
[01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:38.560]   to have how Facebook suddenly just took over the world a lot?
[01:29:38.560 --> 01:29:41.800]   It seems like it would be a really good lesson.
[01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:43.080]   Moreality to you.
[01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:44.720]   Why do you think Larry?
[01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:45.720]   Because it was tacky.
[01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:49.440]   I mean, even, you know, they hired this guy, Kamantya Niggum as a security officer and
[01:29:49.440 --> 01:29:53.920]   they really cleaned up the safety issue, the predator issue that was fixed.
[01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:57.280]   But it remained tacky, the advertising they would put up.
[01:29:57.280 --> 01:29:58.920]   There's any move on Larry.
[01:29:58.920 --> 01:29:59.920]   Freedom.
[01:29:59.920 --> 01:30:03.440]   Does anybody but me find these coincidences kind of disturbing.
[01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:05.480]   They cleaned up the predators.
[01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:08.040]   They cleaned up this and then it started to fail.
[01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:10.240]   Maybe they're having the predators was a good thing.
[01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:15.400]   It's like there's a guy on the daily comedy central's daily show once it says, you know
[01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:19.080]   if there's a lot of predators, that means there must be a lot of prey.
[01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:20.080]   That's a good thing.
[01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:23.960]   I mean, is it possible that that was the cool thing about my space?
[01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:24.960]   I don't know.
[01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:25.960]   I don't think so.
[01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:29.120]   I think the predator threat was and is still way over exaggerated.
[01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:30.320]   The predators, it was overblown.
[01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:32.520]   It was bull crap, but it was at least made of that.
[01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:35.840]   The whole thing was tacky and it was good that it was tacky.
[01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:41.680]   I think people was like going to the old Times Square in the olden days when it was sleazy.
[01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:43.640]   I mean, you'd go to now it's just crappy.
[01:30:43.640 --> 01:30:46.200]   It's just, you know, it was the Disney thing.
[01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:47.200]   They did clean it up.
[01:30:47.200 --> 01:30:49.320]   I mean, the UI is much nicer.
[01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:50.320]   It's pretty Facebook.
[01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:51.480]   It's much nicer.
[01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:54.000]   Too late, obviously.
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:56.000]   Somebody's saying it's like GeoCities or Tripod.
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:59.520]   Both of those were pretty hideous and they're both gone.
[01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:04.840]   But I don't think my space was heavily used and was very important for independent musicians.
[01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:09.680]   I think it was really the first place independent musicians got to get some exposure without
[01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:10.680]   a record label.
[01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:11.680]   That's right.
[01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:15.000]   And in fact, it's still used by a lot of musicians and that's where it started.
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:19.640]   And it became sort of the teenage playground for a long time and it was very popular among
[01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:21.040]   teenage kids.
[01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:24.200]   And also my space allowed for a lot of creativity.
[01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:28.680]   You could do almost anything on your homepage, including bouncing balls and four different
[01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:30.520]   kinds of music playing at the same time.
[01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:32.280]   And it was a cacophony.
[01:31:32.280 --> 01:31:34.680]   It was just such a messy environment.
[01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:36.120]   And then Facebook came along.
[01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:39.520]   First of all, was it's elite Harvard clientele to begin with.
[01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:42.800]   And they expanded it to colleges and then branched out to the rest of us.
[01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:44.880]   They came along with a much cleaner interface.
[01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:49.920]   But sometimes I worry with all the applications and all the changes to Facebook that it could
[01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:55.160]   be going gradually and slowly in that same direction.
[01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:56.160]   So all right.
[01:31:56.160 --> 01:31:57.920]   I know I'm not going to get any predictions out of your guess.
[01:31:57.920 --> 01:31:58.920]   Oh, we're still in prediction.
[01:31:58.920 --> 01:31:59.920]   I'm in like three times.
[01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:01.000]   I'll give you a prediction.
[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.000]   Yeah.
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.320]   Yeah, what?
[01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:06.040]   You said you'll give me a prediction.
[01:32:06.040 --> 01:32:07.320]   Okay, a prediction.
[01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:11.880]   There was going to be more and more encroaching by the federal government and other governments
[01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:14.480]   based in Europe and elsewhere on the internet.
[01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:20.200]   We're going to start seeing a situation start to apply where the FCC starts to move in.
[01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:25.240]   They tried to at one time move in on cable TV, but there was too much pressure against
[01:32:25.240 --> 01:32:26.240]   that.
[01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:30.800]   But now they see the internet wide open using the shoehorn issue, of course, is net neutrality.
[01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:35.440]   They're going to find a way to become all of a sudden the gatekeeper of the internet.
[01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:38.720]   The next thing you know, they're going to be licensing for blogs and all the rest of
[01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:39.720]   it.
[01:32:39.720 --> 01:32:42.360]   They're going to be a disaster and it's coming your way.
[01:32:42.360 --> 01:32:43.360]   So what's it?
[01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:49.040]   Yeah, except that I said told you that on this show about two years ago when you were
[01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:52.240]   a big enthusiast for net neutrality in those days.
[01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:54.960]   Well, I guess we didn't get net neutrality.
[01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:58.200]   We were going to end up at 200 baht or something.
[01:32:58.200 --> 01:33:01.560]   Well, I tell him, I told you I told you.
[01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:03.320]   No, and we don't have net neutrality.
[01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:06.160]   We don't have an FCC's attempt to pass it.
[01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:10.640]   The FCC is going to use that issue as that that was the problem.
[01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:15.200]   The problem with these things is that net neutrality may be a great thing to do.
[01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:19.560]   But if you create a bureaucracy to do something, it won't do what you told it to.
[01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:21.320]   It will do what it wants to do.
[01:33:21.320 --> 01:33:23.360]   No, and I agree with you.
[01:33:23.360 --> 01:33:25.200]   And that's obviously a problem we're facing.
[01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:27.000]   I mean, we're squeezing two directions.
[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:30.120]   We see it's been told by Congress not to touch the internet.
[01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:33.200]   It's been told by the courts not to touch the internet.
[01:33:33.200 --> 01:33:34.440]   So what did they do?
[01:33:34.440 --> 01:33:38.600]   They immediately came out with regulations saying that they're in charge of the internet
[01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:39.600]   after all.
[01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:41.680]   So they're getting it from the left and the right.
[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:45.080]   I mean, there are plenty of bloggers that are complaining that the FCC sold out, that
[01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:50.480]   it didn't do enough, that it basically was a cop out, that we've got other people on
[01:33:50.480 --> 01:33:54.600]   the right who are complaining that it's taking over the internet, that it's going to be socialism.
[01:33:54.600 --> 01:33:58.160]   I think the fact the matter is it did practically nothing.
[01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:02.000]   And whether or not this net neutrality turns out to have any impact at all, we'll have
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:03.000]   to see.
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.040]   It's going to accomplish anything.
[01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:11.640]   It's right to do something which it was explicitly told it did not have the authority to do.
[01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:16.520]   Once it gets away with the right, you will be surprised what it does.
[01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:17.520]   That isn't my prediction.
[01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:22.120]   Why Jerry, why would they want to do that?
[01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:24.320]   What would be the interest of the FCC in doing that?
[01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:25.960]   Well, let me take over for a second.
[01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:26.960]   You can tag.
[01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:27.960]   Yeah.
[01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:28.960]   Go on.
[01:34:28.960 --> 01:34:32.520]   Do you want me to go on a little further?
[01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:38.240]   Some of the things that the net does that irritates the government, you think of a lot
[01:34:38.240 --> 01:34:41.560]   of things that the net does that the government wishes didn't happen.
[01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:42.560]   Well, I can think of one.
[01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:43.560]   It's not only that.
[01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:44.560]   It's not only that.
[01:34:44.560 --> 01:34:45.560]   Let me interrupt here.
[01:34:45.560 --> 01:34:47.640]   It's not about having worked for the government at one point.
[01:34:47.640 --> 01:34:51.880]   The government agencies, especially something like the FCC, which is losing a lot of authority
[01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:55.800]   because broadcasting and all these other things are less and less important, wants to do
[01:34:55.800 --> 01:34:57.560]   something with its people.
[01:34:57.560 --> 01:35:00.240]   They want to expand like all other government agencies.
[01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:02.400]   And this is an excuse to do it for no other reason.
[01:35:02.400 --> 01:35:05.120]   It just turns out that most of this will be bad for everybody.
[01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:06.200]   Yeah, you got it.
[01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:10.640]   I mean, it's pronounced iron law of bureaucracy.
[01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:17.480]   Bureaucracies are, you know what I'm saying, iron law, bureaucracies have two kinds of people.
[01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:21.880]   They're the kind of people who are dedicated to what the bureaucracy was created to do,
[01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:24.480]   like classroom teachers, most of them.
[01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:30.000]   And there are people who are dedicated to making sure the bureaucracy itself has power
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:32.600]   and stability and continuity.
[01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:37.840]   The second kind always get in control, always.
[01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:39.840]   They're never one of the same.
[01:35:39.840 --> 01:35:42.240]   It's not as if the FCC invented net neutrality.
[01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:46.840]   There's been pressure from a lot of corners, including a number of internet companies that
[01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:49.640]   are worried about the cable companies and the phone companies.
[01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:53.680]   So it's not about net neutrality, that's the point.
[01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:57.920]   Every democracy part of Obama's campaign promise.
[01:35:57.920 --> 01:36:04.240]   Well, every pornography producer in the world wants net neutrality.
[01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:08.840]   Everybody would love to have the rest of us subsidize the kid down the street who spends
[01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:12.400]   24 hours a day downloading porn.
[01:36:12.400 --> 01:36:14.040]   Or whatever.
[01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:15.760]   There's no, it's not about net neutrality.
[01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:17.440]   It's about government encroachment.
[01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:18.840]   That's what the real key is here.
[01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:22.400]   And the other reason that you leave out in your law, Jerry, is the fact that the only
[01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:27.120]   way that you can make more money in the government is if your agency gets bigger and you have
[01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:28.680]   more people to supervise.
[01:36:28.680 --> 01:36:30.920]   Well, yeah, but that's Parkinson's law.
[01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:32.240]   I didn't invent that.
[01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:38.080]   It's been around since even with Court Parkinson's, and Road Parkinson's laws 30 years ago.
[01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:39.080]   And it's all through.
[01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:45.680]   Government's expand to, without regard to their jobs, they just expand.
[01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:48.480]   The biggest push from Washington is going to be on privacy.
[01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:51.680]   Facebook is going to do something to really piss off Congress.
[01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:53.440]   And I don't know what they're going to do.
[01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:57.560]   The Federal Trade Commission is already making noises, although admittedly, tepid noises.
[01:36:57.560 --> 01:37:01.360]   And I think we're going to see some type of privacy legislation in 2011.
[01:37:01.360 --> 01:37:04.520]   And I think the industry is going to be really split over whether to support it or not.
[01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:05.520]   Well, I love it.
[01:37:05.520 --> 01:37:07.480]   So excuse the butt in.
[01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:10.400]   For three guys who weren't willing to give me any predictions, those are some pretty damn
[01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:11.400]   good predictions.
[01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:12.400]   Thank you.
[01:37:12.400 --> 01:37:19.600]   I am, we'll bring up something none of nobody has.
[01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:22.840]   I wouldn't write off Microsoft on things.
[01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:26.800]   Microsoft has been interested in tablets for a long time.
[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:31.840]   And whether it's this year's tablet or next year, Microsoft is eventually going to come
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:41.240]   up with an iPod competitor that will do things with all that tablet technology that Microsoft
[01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:44.400]   has got and never quite figured out how to do the interfacing for.
[01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:48.120]   You're going to go to Steve Ballmer's keynote and see his announcement because they're going
[01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:49.360]   to have about eight tablets.
[01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:50.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:51.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:57.160]   I, uh, Ballmer, the problem with Microsoft is that nobody left to do vision.
[01:37:57.160 --> 01:38:02.120]   Gates was the heart of that company and he had real visions and we don't see much of
[01:38:02.120 --> 01:38:03.120]   that.
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:04.720]   Ballmer's a great executive officer.
[01:38:04.720 --> 01:38:09.120]   He just wasn't, he just doesn't see too far ahead.
[01:38:09.120 --> 01:38:13.560]   He's very good at carrying out dreams once somebody comes up with them.
[01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:16.400]   They thought Ray Aussie would do it for him, but that didn't work.
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:17.920]   Couldn't do it.
[01:38:17.920 --> 01:38:23.360]   And they don't have anybody who has the vision that Gates had and I'm not going to follow
[01:38:23.360 --> 01:38:24.360]   us at jobs.
[01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:26.920]   There may not be a lot of people in the world that have that kind of vision.
[01:38:26.920 --> 01:38:29.240]   Steve Jobs and Bill Gates.
[01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:30.240]   Sure.
[01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:34.000]   But on the other hand, they have the leftovers of Gates.
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:38.240]   I mean, Gates was a big tablet enthusiast.
[01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:44.560]   And my eventual prediction is that we're going to have the pocket computer that I had
[01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:46.600]   in Moten God's eye.
[01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:49.360]   It's a little too big to fit in your pocket.
[01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:53.280]   So we're going to have to come up with some kind of caribab at men carry.
[01:38:53.280 --> 01:38:59.200]   So your iPhone and your iPad and all the rest of it are all one device.
[01:38:59.200 --> 01:39:02.320]   Why would you want an iPhone plus an iPad?
[01:39:02.320 --> 01:39:08.080]   You need, you need, you don't need a Kindle because the iPad is easier to reusing Kindle's
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:11.080]   software than it is with the Kindle.
[01:39:11.080 --> 01:39:15.640]   Well, Jerry, this isn't a prediction, but Gates is still chairman of Microsoft.
[01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:19.080]   Maybe he can turn the foundation over to Melinda and he could take it back over to CEO.
[01:39:19.080 --> 01:39:20.480]   It's been done before.
[01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:22.200]   If he wants to.
[01:39:22.200 --> 01:39:28.440]   And I know it's been done before and I wonder if sometimes Bill doesn't kind of chafe at
[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:33.840]   the bit about not about watching what's happening with the company.
[01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:36.720]   All it takes is a big injection of vision again.
[01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:37.720]   They have the money.
[01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:38.720]   They have the people.
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:44.200]   Maybe they don't have quite all the top people that Google's getting some away from them
[01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:45.800]   and other places.
[01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:49.760]   But Microsoft has an awful lot of very bright people.
[01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:55.200]   They have the determination and they go through the iterations of things and eventually they
[01:39:55.200 --> 01:39:57.280]   will iterate up to something alike.
[01:39:57.280 --> 01:40:01.280]   I mean, you look what they did in games.
[01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:04.680]   I'm going to table this conversation.
[01:40:04.680 --> 01:40:10.520]   I'm going to table this conversation and adjourn this meeting until 12 noon Pacific time on
[01:40:10.520 --> 01:40:14.600]   Saturday when we are going to announce the sofa awards.
[01:40:14.600 --> 01:40:17.720]   These significant old fart awards.
[01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:21.400]   I hope they come up with a better name.
[01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:22.400]   I'm sure.
[01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:24.720]   Well, Gina is young, so we can't call it that.
[01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:26.600]   So we'll, yeah, we'll find something.
[01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:29.240]   But we are going to find our best product to CES.
[01:40:29.240 --> 01:40:32.440]   And we'll announce that on Saturday.
[01:40:32.440 --> 01:40:34.480]   But I know all three of you will be part of our broadcast.
[01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:37.080]   We go to it goes to CES Wednesday evening.
[01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:38.760]   We start with digital experience.
[01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:43.720]   Tom Merritt and Becky Worley from ABC News will be covering that.
[01:40:43.720 --> 01:40:45.200]   We'll have Brian Brushwood with us.
[01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:47.280]   Sarah Lane, I'll be there.
[01:40:47.280 --> 01:40:50.560]   We are going to cover wall to wall CES better than it's ever been covered before.
[01:40:50.560 --> 01:40:53.760]   And thanks to these three guys, I think we're going to have some superior coverage on Saturday
[01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:54.760]   as well.
[01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:56.400]   And Jerry, you said you'd be in the press room.
[01:40:56.400 --> 01:40:59.000]   We'll come by and talk to you there as well.
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:00.000]   All right.
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:01.000]   Jerry Parnell.
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:02.000]   JerryPornell.com.
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:06.440]   Go there and subscribe to the Chaos Manor.
[01:41:06.440 --> 01:41:08.480]   Columns, well worth it.
[01:41:08.480 --> 01:41:11.480]   And maybe someday we'll see it back again in Bite Magazine.
[01:41:11.480 --> 01:41:12.840]   I would love to see that.
[01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:15.600]   That would be a move in the right direction.
[01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:18.520]   Also, John C. Devorak, channeldevorak.com.
[01:41:18.520 --> 01:41:22.040]   That's where you'll find him no agenda and a bunch of other shows.
[01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:28.800]   And of course, he's got Barney Obama there with him.
[01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:30.000]   What happens when you press his hand?
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:31.000]   Does he ask for money?
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:32.000]   All right.
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:33.000]   Thank you, John.
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.000]   Larry Magad is at Larry's world.
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:35.000]   You also hear him on CBS radio.
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:36.000]   You got a phone call, Larry?
[01:41:36.000 --> 01:41:37.000]   I'm talking to Jimmy Carter.
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:38.000]   He just called him his phone.
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:41.000]   I thank you all for joining us.
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:44.000]   Please do join us live at CES.
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:55.320]   We're going to be Wednesday evening, Thursday evening, all day Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
[01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:57.720]   The next tweet will be a Saturday tweet.
[01:41:57.720 --> 01:41:58.720]   You're all invited again.
[01:41:58.720 --> 01:42:01.520]   It's 3 p.m. Pacific Times, 6 p.m. Eastern Time Live.
[01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:03.760]   .Twit.tv for all that CES coverage.
[01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:05.160]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:06.160]   Thank you for being here.
[01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:07.160]   We'll see you next time.
[01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:10.160]   Another tweet is in the can.
[01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:17.600]   I can't top that.
[01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:19.760]   You can't top it.
[01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:24.920]   Hey, before I say good night, I do want to remind you that we are beginning our seventh
[01:42:24.920 --> 01:42:25.920]   year.
[01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:26.920]   Wow.
[01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:27.920]   We're going to be doing a lot of work.tv.
[01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:31.160]   And I'd like to ask some help if you don't mind.
[01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:32.880]   We do this every year.
[01:42:32.880 --> 01:42:38.240]   Our podcast advertising agency, Pod Track, likes to do a survey of our audience.
[01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:40.240]   It helps us sell to it.
[01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:42.640]   We know how many people listen, but we don't know much about you.
[01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:44.760]   So, the more we know about your demographics, the better.
[01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:47.320]   It's about a five page online survey.
[01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:52.280]   Easy to take if you just go to twit.tv and click the link at the top of the page, you
[01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:57.160]   can take it or go to bit.ly/listenersurvey.
[01:42:57.160 --> 01:42:58.800]   It's easy way to do it too.
[01:42:58.800 --> 01:43:04.560]   Twit.tv at the top of the page, take our survey or bit.ly/listenersurvey.
[01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:09.000]   At the end of the survey, it will ask if you'd like to join the Pod Track panel.
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:13.600]   That's a very useful research panel that we come back to you a few times a year and ask
[01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:14.600]   you questions.
[01:43:14.600 --> 01:43:18.320]   Again, this helps us a lot with making our advertisers happy.
[01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:23.200]   And when happy advertisers pay money to put the show on the air, I'm happy.
[01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:27.720]   And you're happy because we can do what we do like these trips to CES.
[01:43:27.720 --> 01:43:29.360]   So I appreciate any help you can do this.
[01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:30.360]   Thank you.

[01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:31.360]   [music]
[01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:32.360]   [music]
[01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:33.360]   [music]
[01:43:33.360 --> 01:43:34.360]   [music]
[01:43:34.360 --> 01:43:35.360]   [music]
