[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:17.760]   about the changing, streaming landscape is streaming about to be cable TV. Maybe you're
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.840]   going to watch the House of Dragons tonight. We'll also discuss the very weird Mark Zuckerberg
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:32.400]   Avatar and its relationship to a 18th century sculpture and then no children in the bathroom
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.280]   without surveillance, a new tool for schools that's raising the ire, all of that coming
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.320]   up and a lot more this week on Twit.

[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:21.240]   Alright, for Twit this week at Tech, the show where we cover the weeks, Tech News with fabulous
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.760]   technology, journalists. We've got a great panel for you kicking things off with my dear
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.960]   friend Jason Heiner. Now editor in chief of ZDNet. I guess we first met when you were
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:37.600]   at the Tech Republic, right? That's right, yes. Way back in the good old days and then
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.280]   way back through several acquisitions. You never really left the company. It's true,
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.240]   right? Not since 2001, not since 2001. I've been here at Tech Republic and then Tech
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:54.160]   Republic and ZDNet and then CNET and then back to ZDNet. But all the same, basically
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.480]   parent company and my start date is still the same. 21 years. That's kind of mind blowing
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.400]   Jason. That's awesome. That's for sure. I thought it would last a year at best. So it's
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.240]   all a bonus. Well, I kind of know what you mean when I started podcasting. I thought,
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.000]   well, there's no future in this, but I'll play with it. I've been doing it quite as
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.920]   long as you have, but almost 18 years, 18 years now. Also, let's say hello to a good
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.360]   friend, a new friend. He's been on several times now, Nicholas De Leon from Consumer Union,
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.240]   Consumer Reports. He's a senior electronics reporter over there. Hey Nicholas.
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.840]   Hello, Leo. How are you? Great to see you. Thank you. Yeah, I love having you on. You
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.560]   were kind of a late discovery. I think it's been a couple of years now, but it was so
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.920]   great when I found you on So Glad. I've basically cold-clalmed you. As I've explained in the
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.640]   past, I've been a fan of you for a long, long time. I cold-e-mailed you to say, "Hey, I'm
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.920]   a big fan of your work. Keep it up." So glad you did. So glad you did. Yeah, thank you.
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:04.840]   Also, another longtime friend. Now at Protocol, it's of course Owen Thomas. He's senior editor
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.960]   over there. It's not the protocol or a protocol. It's just protocol, right? It's protocol.
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:15.280]   It's protocol. Protocol. Hey, it's how things are done. Yeah. He's got a great big P on his
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:22.920]   polo shirt. It stands for protocol. Great to see you. Okay. Show of hands. How many of
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:29.040]   you are going to watch House of Dragons tonight? The New Game of Thrones. New York Times actually
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:35.800]   had an article say, "Let's not." So two out of three are not. That's very interesting.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.440]   Owen, you and I will be watching this. In fact, it's like a special date. It's the prequel
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.080]   to the Game of Thrones saga that does not come from George RR Martin's pen, which is
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:54.040]   why they could do it because they've used up all his ink and then some. Did he ever finish
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:02.040]   the book? No. Nope. Nope. No. No. Working on it. Yeah. He and Patrick Rothfuss have become
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:10.400]   kind of the Duke Nukem Forever of fantasy fiction, right? Promised but never delivered. That's
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:17.200]   okay. In fact, George RR Martin, probably for political reasons, said this is the prequel
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:26.440]   that should have always existed. I'm 100% behind the House of Dragons. But number of
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.840]   people pointed out this is kind of a battle between old Hollywood and new media because
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:40.240]   in two weeks, Lord of the Rings debuts on Amazon. So you have Warner Brothers, 100-year-old
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.760]   motion picture company. I don't know if this really counts as Warner Brothers. It's been
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:51.400]   acquired. It's been sold. It's been bought. It's a, but it's now part of Warner Discovery
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:59.640]   and all of that. So this old line media company, creating Game of Thrones, spent a lot of money.
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:05.440]   Amazon spent even more money for the streaming rights to the Lord of the Rings series and
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.600]   then created their own. Is it a prequel or a sequel? I think it's a prequel to the Lord of
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:17.000]   the Rings. It's a prequel because I think the Lord of the Rings proper, the trilogy and
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.840]   the Hobbit, those rights. They're gone. Far as I know, remain with Warner. Yeah. Oh, isn't
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:28.600]   that funny? Warner has him. Oh, that's hysterical. So I'm both interesting. Yeah. It's such a
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:35.600]   morass. We're watching The Sandman right now on Netflix, but it's a DC Comics property.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:47.160]   Right. And it's such a patchwork of rights and intellectual property. It doesn't, to
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.960]   a consumer, I don't think it makes any sense. It doesn't give you any signpost to it. Where
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:57.680]   you're going to find the stories you like. Yeah. It's said that Amazon spent a quarter
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:03.440]   of a billion dollars getting the rights alone for the Lord of the Rings prequel and committed
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.840]   to five seasons. They're already, but they hasn't even debuted. Five seasons worth at
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:16.320]   least a billion dollars, which would make it at least at the time, most expensive TV series
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:26.560]   ever. I imagine though, that Warner is spending a lot on House of the Dragon, the prequel.
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:33.160]   I'm just looking to see if I can find a number. I don't know how many seasons they've committed
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:37.680]   to though. That's interesting. And remember, it's not going to have the showrunners from
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.400]   Game of Thrones, David Benioff and Dan Weiss. After the last season, maybe people are going
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:52.000]   to be glad. I just, it's a very interesting battle. And the New York Times today says,
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   don't watch either one of them. I think it's Linkbait to be honest. Did I write that? Man,
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.880]   that's not. Is that how you feel? Are you going to admit that? I could not. I'm sure they'll
[00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:11.000]   be fine, but I could not be less interested in a media thing than the Dragon show or Lord.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.640]   Like, I feel like Lord of the Rings. I feel A, the books are still awesome. B, the movies,
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:20.480]   to me, came out basically yesterday. I don't, I don't understand the point of, of this
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:26.080]   new reboot or the show or whatever. I, I don't know. I don't get it. I'm, I'm, I'm more of
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:30.920]   a video game guy anyway. So I really shouldn't even be talking. But yeah, I, I personally am
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:38.440]   not super interested in either property actually. It's, it's kind of life or death. I think at
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:47.920]   this point for HBO, HBO has been going through a lot of troubles of late. Streaming viewing
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:55.280]   is flat. They just canceled, I think 38 shows to save money from, they just kicked them
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:00.920]   off HBO, including a lot of originals. I think there's a bit of a struggle going on these
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:06.280]   days. And I wonder, cause Amazon and Apple have a big advantage. We've talked about this
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:13.240]   before. Their business does not rely on the success of, of a TV show. Right. They can afford
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:24.080]   to spend a billion dollars on a TV show. Yeah. Just to drive traffic, right? For sure. It's,
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:28.680]   it is a big advantage. I mean, I don't, we just finished a redesign that we've been working
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:32.720]   on for eight months. Beautiful. By the way, I said this off. I just I'll say it on the
[00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:37.160]   air. Gorgeous. Yep. Thank you, Leo. But because of that, I don't really watch TV. I just see
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:44.160]   spoilers on Twitter. Are you saying that you have been staying up all night doing this redesign?
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:50.160]   Well, obviously I'm not, I'm not the person doing the redesign, but we've been time for
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:56.960]   sleep. But we've been for eight months. We've been really, really busy and, and also working
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.800]   on, you know, we've been doing some hiring and doing other things. So because of that,
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:08.920]   I haven't been watching a whole lot of TV. That said, I do understand this really evolving
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:12.840]   landscape. We write about it. We think about it. We, we talk about it a lot, the evolving
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:20.480]   landscape of media. And it is getting to the point where it is getting to an inflection
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:26.920]   point where there's such, there's not enough money coming in from the old streams for,
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:35.040]   for old media. And now you have Apple and Amazon who essentially throw in their, their media
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:41.960]   buys as part of becoming part of this very expensive subscription, right? For Amazon Prime
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:46.560]   or, or Apple one, I guess Apple one, you wouldn't call it very expensive, but, but still more
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:53.720]   than what Netflix costs, you know, typically. So they, they have, they're just playing a
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:58.640]   different game. And so because of that, and the numbers are a lot different, they have
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:03.200]   a built, they have built in audiences for what they're doing. And so all of a sudden
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:08.720]   you're seeing like really this year, there, there's a changing landscape that's happening
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:16.720]   in media. And now it's starting to affect not just these big box sort of films and, and
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:22.640]   media franchises, but now it's slipping over into live sports as well, which is sort of
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:28.320]   the last, the last piece of the puzzle that a lot of the traditional media companies,
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:32.720]   like my former employees, CBS, you know, had to, you know, they had a corner on the market
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:37.920]   and that's rapidly changing. And so I think we, we certainly should be prepared that the
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:40.360]   game looks a little different going forward.
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:47.520]   Do you think, I mean, we just learned that the Senna World, which owns Regal theaters,
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:54.560]   Claire bankruptcy, do you think that it's over for movie houses going out to see the movies?
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:59.360]   Did COVID finally put it out of its misery? Do you think we're all staying home to watch
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:05.280]   streaming now? Or in your case, Jason, not watch anything, but stay home and work, which
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.280]   is so sad.
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:12.640]   Yeah, it is sad. So no, I think that when, when I go by, and I have actually seen a few
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:17.840]   movies in the theater over the last six months, the theaters look pretty crowded to me. And
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:22.640]   it might be sort of the post COVID going back. Yeah, they, yeah, they couldn't get back on their
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:28.800]   feet after a very bad couple of years, I think. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So there is an experience that
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.560]   the movies, I think if you can create experiences, it's the same thing that some of the retailers
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:37.280]   are doing, right? If you can create experiences where that people can get, you know, in store,
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:43.440]   like Alamo draft house, where you go, you can get tacos, you can get beer and watch a movie.
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:49.760]   Yeah, exactly. If you have those in person experiences, because you can't replicate that online,
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:53.440]   I mean, you get a little bit in your, in your living room, but, but sometimes you want to get
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:58.240]   out of your living room. And that's where you want to take advantage of cool experiences like that.
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:04.320]   So also the studios, it's, I think there's a crunch for talent. And the studios are now competing
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:09.680]   with streaming. And there's a lot of money from coming from Apple and Amazon
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:15.120]   and others, I guess HBO, Netflix for sure. And that's competing with
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:23.040]   movies for talent. And there's a, there's a limited talent pool. There is, as we're seen by the lack
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:28.640]   of quality from some of these shows that I haven't watched. Yeah. But the lack of quality in movies,
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:32.560]   I can't think of a, I mean, there've been a few good movies, but it's not like been a great year
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:37.600]   for motion pictures, has it? No, partly why I don't watch is like, I haven't seen a whole lot of good
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:42.560]   quality things coming out that give me any urgency to, you know, want to carve the time out. Like,
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:47.760]   I'd rather go exercise or spend time like playing video, like, like Nicholas mentioned,
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:51.360]   playing video games with my kids or doing something like that than watching the shoes,
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:56.240]   because the quality, it's so watered down because these, all of these places are buying so much
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:01.200]   content. And then, and then the quality of content is pretty low, because then all of these writers
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:04.880]   are just having to pump out, you know, it's a, it's a golden age if you're a writer,
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:10.000]   with first of scripts, because you just get to pump out stuff constantly. But because of that,
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:16.560]   the quality is not great. In July, for the first time ever streaming had more viewers than cable
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:23.440]   TV, according to Nielsen. And the number one streamers still, despite struggles, is Netflix,
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:30.800]   with 8% of the market, YouTube, of course, doing very well, 7.3, then Hulu, prime video,
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:41.200]   Disney plus an HBO Max with only 1%. Hulu did well thanks to only murders in the building and
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:47.360]   the bear, which I loved. The bear was a great show, if you like food and restaurants. Netflix,
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:53.200]   despite, you know, struggling a little bit with stranger things wasn't as big as they had hoped.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:15:00.240]   They spent $200 million on the gray man. In fact, I've already greenlit three, two, two more movies,
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:07.920]   a third, second and third sequel with Ryan Gosling as a Jason Bourne style superhero.
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:13.600]   And I say superhero, but it's actually made by the two guys who did
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:20.080]   Avengers Endgame. So it definitely has that it has a very much it was a comic book feel to it.
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:25.600]   But unfortunately, it it did very well. It's first week and didn't do so well in subsequent
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:32.080]   weeks. Maybe the people didn't like it. I thought it was fun. So 5 billion minutes.
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:44.320]   That's how Netflix measures it. 5 billion minutes of viewing time, 8% of the total TV viewing.
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:48.720]   It were just, you know what? This is just, and you might say, well, it's a text story. It is a
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:53.360]   text story because it's how technology has very much changed every part of our lives,
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:16:00.000]   including how we are entertained. I think we even though streaming just overtook cable,
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.160]   I think we may have kind of already passed peak streaming, at least in the Hollywood Gold Rush
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:14.000]   sense. HBO Max is cutting back on its production of originals and also like the made for streaming
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.280]   category of movies. So under the new CEO of Warner Brothers Discovery, David Zasloff,
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:26.240]   they've said, we're going to make big theatrical movies and we're going to make movies for HBO,
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:33.200]   streaming and cable. But we're not going to make as many HBO Max, you know.
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:36.960]   Well, they're also merging the Discovery plus an HBO.
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:43.280]   And their theory is there, I think, is you have a lot of cheap unscripted reality TV
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:49.120]   coming in from Discovery. And the economic model that is just far superior to putting
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:56.400]   out a big splashing movie, especially if you're not amortizing that IP across physical theaters,
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:04.240]   maybe cable distribution, maybe other licensing. Not to mention the fact that Warner Brothers
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:16.720]   Discovery has $55 billion in debt. Yikes. That's a lot of debt. Netflix is not debt-free,
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:25.120]   but they've borrowed a lot of money at very cheap rates during that long, low interest rate
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:30.480]   environment we've been in. That's obviously changing too. And I think the economy,
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:37.520]   the macro economy is affecting Hollywood too, in that sense. Debt's a little more expensive.
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:46.640]   So the premise that you use really cheap money to fund all of this IP creation that you then
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:54.400]   amortize over time, that the calculus is different now. Netflix debt compared to $55 billion is
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:18:04.480]   $14.5 billion. But they also have $6 billion in cash. But their annual interest is the interest
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:09.600]   they have to pay every year, $752 million. This is why Netflix, by the way, has been having a lot
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:14.960]   of trouble in the stock market. People are nervous about the future of Netflix. I don't know. What
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:20.640]   do you think? What's the future? Where do we get our entertainment in the future? I think
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:26.000]   Nicholas might be a harbinger. We're just going to talk about video games going forward.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:33.040]   I'll tell us a fun little anecdote. In 2006, I was at Gizmodo. And we had some consulting
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:37.920]   thing with Time Warner. So we flew out to California. And some guys were showing them off, oh,
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:42.800]   here are the new phones. Some guys are showing them off here. Here's the new whatever. I was in
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:48.080]   charge of video games. But the more interesting conversation I had with them was I was explaining
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:52.240]   how I consumed media, how I consumed content. I was like, and I was very frank with them. I was
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:56.560]   like, look, I torrent everything. I have an XBM, I was 20 at the time. I was like, I torrent everything.
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:01.760]   I have XBMC hooked up to my TV. I have an over the earth antenna. They did not hear from you.
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:07.360]   Yeah, no, I was like, dude, I'm never going to pay for this stuff. Oh my God. Yeah. Okay. When I was
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:12.240]   20, that's perhaps not the most polite way to say that. But the point is I was like, look,
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:17.040]   this is kind of the future here. You've got people sitting at home with their own kind of self-selected
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:23.600]   media situation, which is basically all Netflix and Disney+ is now today. But they were very
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:27.280]   skeptical. They're like, oh, people aren't going to stay home and want to pick and choose which
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:32.880]   shows they want to watch. I was like, are you crazy? You what? So I feel vindicated, you know,
[00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:37.520]   however many years later that yeah, that's exactly what happened. And you know,
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:43.200]   listen to that Nicholas kid. I mean, it's what again, I was fairly, you know, silly about,
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:47.280]   oh, very cavalier about my consumption habit. But like, this is like, why would I do you?
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:50.080]   Right. Why would I watch linear television? You were absolutely right.
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:55.120]   Pick and choose my truth, my own adventure. And I think about just very skeptical. I was like,
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:20:01.600]   okay, whatever. At that time, I would think about my kid who would never watch TV, watch YouTube.
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:06.400]   And when his friends came over, they just had YouTube playing nonstop. I mean, it was a
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:10.640]   harbinger of the future. And remember, Hollywood's response to this was Quibi.
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:16.480]   Yeah, of course. Which is now the punchline to a joke. Like does anybody remember Quibi?
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:24.320]   They fumbled this future to some degree. But remember, House Game of Thrones really did very
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:28.000]   well. So I understand why they're saying, well, maybe we can do, you know, reproduce that success
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:35.040]   with House of Dragons. I wouldn't want to be in their shoes at this point. Is it a golden time
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:39.920]   for creators? There's a lot of money floating about. But I think it's getting tighter.
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:47.200]   Yeah, it is getting tighter. And we talked about this, I remember both Ben Stiller,
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:54.000]   creator of Severance on Apple TV, and two of the principles in the Ted Lasso show saying,
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:59.440]   it's weird doing a show for Apple because we have no idea how many people are watching.
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:04.560]   If anybody's watching, they don't give us numbers. And that's the other thing with streaming. You
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:11.120]   heard what Netflix numbers are. Well, we have 15 billion minutes. Like, what is that? Compare
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:16.560]   that to ratings effect now for the first time ever Amazon and Nielsen closed a deal to have
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:22.080]   Nielsen, which is the classical TV rating system to give them numbers on Thursday night football,
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:27.840]   which is moving to streaming this season. Yeah, I was going to say, things are getting tighter
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:32.640]   unless you're a sports league. You know, those rights don't seem to be, you know, Nick Khan,
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:37.920]   who is the co CEO of WWE, he was very bullish on the idea of the streamers moving into live.
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:41.840]   They had their conference call about a week ago. And he's like, look, Netflix already
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:48.560]   reportedly bid on F1 live rights, YouTube reportedly bid on NFL Sunday ticket. These
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:52.800]   streamers are coming. And it's just a matter of time. Look, I watch a lot of soccer. That's
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:58.400]   on ESPN plus for La Liga Barcelona. Yeah, but a major league soccer in the US, the US Soccer League,
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:04.880]   is all going to be an Apple TV in years, which is great. Well, it's an interesting conversation.
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:09.520]   Is that good for the league or is it not? Because now you're you're on this premium platform,
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:15.280]   which is OK, that's fine. It's Apple is shiny, but are ordinary folks going to stumble across
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:20.400]   the game? Are they going to pay Apple? Yes, you know, whatever it is a month, five bucks a month,
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:25.600]   just a one soccer. Are you choosing short term money over medium to longer term exposure? And
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:29.360]   that is a question I don't think anybody knows the answer to. And so Nick Khan's answer was like,
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.640]   well, we're going to do everything. We're going to have a streaming package. We're going to have
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:36.880]   a broadcast TV package. We're going to have a cable package. I only bring up w because I like
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:40.880]   wrestling. And I think they're actually speaking of streaming business, an excellent company to
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:45.920]   kind of study because they've been kind of navigating the digital media situation for
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:52.160]   arguably their entire existence. You know, they're basically a content or an IP company,
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:55.440]   and they're just selling it to who's the highest bidder. And nowadays, these are the highest
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:58.880]   bidder. So they're actually for the folks listening, kind of an interesting, you wouldn't necessarily
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:02.640]   think it, but they're an interesting company to study in this kind of wider conversation.
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:07.040]   Well, that's what the NFL is trying to be too, right? The NFL, which made a lot of money off
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:12.480]   broadcast television and still is heavily broadcast. It created an app, NFL plus,
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:16.000]   and they're now in conversations for Sunday ticket, which they say is going to cost
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.880]   two, no, three, was it two and a half billion or three and a half billion? A lot of money,
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:27.120]   more than a billion a year, I think, for somebody. And of course, that immediately direct TV,
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:31.360]   which paid a billion and a half last time and lost half a billion a year for three years said,
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:38.560]   that's not going to be us. Immediately Google Amazon and Apple said, well, we're make some money.
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:44.240]   Maybe we could be players here. Yeah, and Apple also does MLB. They have live games on Friday
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:50.160]   nights, which are kind of an interesting experiment for them. I'm not a fan of what they're doing.
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:55.280]   Well, no, I've been a baseball fan my whole life. I've really got way back into it this year for
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:24:01.840]   whatever reason. And the Apple TV broadcasts are okay. I would say the presentation is interesting.
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:06.000]   Pretty sure it's 1080p. The announcers, and I'm certainly not the only person who complained to
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.800]   just who they're not super good. And it's a question like if I want to watch the Mets,
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:14.640]   I'm a Mets guy. I want to hear Keith Hernandez. Yes, you want the local guys.
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:20.800]   I want to hear the rumor that the NFL will start using our offering. And this is something you
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:27.200]   can do on streaming. Multiple soundtracks. You could pick the home team. You could pick the away team.
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:32.480]   Yes. I think that's really interesting, right? You could choose. You could do that with MLB TV,
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:37.040]   MLB TV as well. You could choose the home broadcast or the away broadcast. I always choose a home.
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:42.080]   I'm a homer. I want to hear my Giants. Yeah. I want to hear my guy. Yeah. I don't want to hear.
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:46.480]   Sometimes they get annoying and you're like, okay, I've got to switch over. At least you have the choice.
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:51.520]   Yeah, the choice. The worst thing is to watch a national broadcast in any sport and hear people
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:56.480]   dis your team. Or they don't even know what they're talking about. It's just the worst.
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:03.760]   Yes. Yeah. So this is, I think it's an opportunity. I honestly think that the MLS deal with Apple
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:07.760]   10 years for Major League Soccer, which has not been doing that well in the US. It's always been
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:13.520]   a struggle to get soccer and big in the US. It's a real opportunity for on Apple's part to show
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:17.760]   how you can use technology. Do 4K. Do, you know,
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:25.360]   you know, USFL's been using drones to, they were drunk going to the huddle and then zoom out and
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:31.520]   zoom and I'm just waiting for a player to go, get out of here. It's like the drone. But it's really
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:36.480]   great as a viewer to see unique angles, unique. And I think Apple could do a lot with stats.
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:41.920]   They could really be interesting and they, I hope they will. They haven't done that with baseball.
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:45.920]   All they've done is minimal with baseball, which is exactly not what I want.
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:49.200]   MLS is small enough. It's, it's, it's, it's, it's a major league. It's depending on
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.640]   how you're talking to it's to major league, but it's a small league. So I feel it definitely
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:57.200]   affords Apple the ability. And I'm sure MLS, you know, figure this as well to experiment to see
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:00.400]   what they can kind of do. This is not the NFL where you're not going to mess with the NFL.
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:04.800]   That's, that's. They won't trade you. Yeah. Yeah. They won't let you. And major league baseball
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:08.400]   feels like they would, they would just like not want, but like major league soccer is like,
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:13.360]   okay, let's see, let's excuse younger anyway, the sport, at least in the United States.
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:17.680]   So it's like, let's, let's see what we can do here to make this more, more exciting,
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:21.600]   or more kinetic and more interesting. It is a more dynamic broadcast. It feels like MLS is like
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:26.800]   the perfect size league to kind of try to figure that out with. To experiment. I will say the only
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:33.680]   interesting thing I've ever seen in 8K was a soccer match on a 98 inch Samsung TV. Oh, yeah.
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:38.880]   Where where you look and you sit the ball goes across the screen and it's not a blur, right?
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:43.760]   Yeah. You actually see the ball tracking like you're looking through a window. And then they also
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:49.200]   experimented with some different angles down on the field up from sort of the. Where was this?
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:56.960]   So I mean, this was it. This was in Korea, Samsung. There you go. Okay. So it was filmed just to show
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:05.200]   off 8K. So very interesting, but it made me actually feel like soccer was less boring watching it,
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:11.920]   you know, in 8K. And so which is for the US soccer is tough because, you know, a lot of these
[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:17.120]   games are like one, nothing, two, nothing. The ball just goes back and forth. They call penalties
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:21.280]   and we don't know why what off they flop on the ground and they looked like they've been hurt.
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:26.160]   They're actually said bad times like they seven AM East Coast, which is for Ian Pacific.
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:31.200]   No one in no one California. Hey, I get up at 6 AM to watch Formula One. Don't tell me about that.
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:37.600]   Yeah, I'm willing to do that. Wow. So with with rising production costs and rising, you know,
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:43.040]   rights rights deals are the economics going to follow. That's a great question. Yeah.
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:46.000]   Yeah, that's a good question. You know, I don't know if we can sustain the number.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.080]   But that's why you look at Amazon, Apple, Google, because they have income,
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:57.760]   you know, especially Amazon and Apple, it's all part of a services play, you know, prime is really
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:02.400]   to get people in the door. I don't think they have to make money on any individual thing. Or maybe
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:06.080]   they do. I don't know. You know, maybe their shareholders are going to say, wait a minute,
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:09.760]   why are you spending hundreds of millions of dollars on something that's not making you any
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:12.400]   money? I don't know. That's always a good question.
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:17.600]   Having subscribers. Yeah. Well, Apple has, Apple has changed its accounting to ARPU,
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:23.360]   average revenue per user. How do you get the average revenue up? You get them to buy Apple
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:27.040]   services, right? You already sold them the phone. How do you get more money out of them?
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:33.760]   Well, we got football, we got soccer, we got baseball. Would you pay for that? Jason,
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:36.320]   we don't think it was going to add. Go ahead. Oh, sorry. Let's go ahead.
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:42.240]   Well, the bubble burst in terms of sports, sports rights fees and this type of thing.
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:45.760]   This conversation has been going on. Again, I'm a wrestling fan, so I kind of studied the
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:52.400]   business aspect of it for a long time. The difference now is like, let's say a decade ago,
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:29:00.480]   it was a broadcast network. It was NBCU, it was Comcast, it was CBS. Now you've got the streamers.
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:05.600]   You've got YouTube and Apple and stuff. 10 years from now, who will be the new entrance
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:12.000]   to keep the bubble rising? It's like, okay, for the NFL deal in the year 2040, who is the new
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:19.760]   company that's going to offer how many multiples of the previous deal? That's a very long term
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:25.600]   question, but the reason why the fees continue to escalate is because of the YouTube and the
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:31.840]   apples of the world. And if those companies, this doesn't do well, they don't get the eyeballs,
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:37.520]   or for the reason they don't want to be in sports anymore, who steps in them? That is a question
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:42.640]   for a little while from now. It's WWE's primer every new from pay-per-view. That's my impression.
[00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:48.080]   It's actually a television. That's a good example of consolidation where
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:52.560]   world wrestling entertainment decided they were not going to make it as a standalone streamer
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:58.880]   and did a deal with Peacock. Interesting. Yeah, for years, they launched the WWE Network in 2014,
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:01.680]   and they had been, I listened to every single world of those conference calls. They kept trying
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:07.280]   to put it all out. Our data is valuable. They thought that 80 million Americans were
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:13.760]   had an affinity was a word they used for WWE. And I was like, 80 million? That is when 5 million
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:19.440]   people watch Monday Night Raw on Mondays for free, you're going to tell me 80 million people
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:24.080]   have an interest in this. So they had weird expectations when they launched their network.
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:28.960]   And yes, Owen was right. They sold it the second they could that had changed leadership. And
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:34.640]   he's like, this is not working. They had a million subscribers, which is fine, but it's a lot easier
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:40.400]   when you get NBCU to pay you $250 million a year. And you basically just have to put on
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:44.400]   basically random matches. They don't have to be good because now you're just providing content.
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:47.920]   You don't even have to convince fans to buy pay per views. You don't have to convince fans
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:52.800]   to buy tickets. It's just NBC you giving you money for whatever the content is. They've got
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:59.040]   that deal. So it is a very interesting turn of events. So forgive me. I'm, you know,
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:06.400]   everything I know about the WWE I learned from Hulk Hogan. I'm not, I'm not, I'm not up on this.
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:12.720]   But I presume there are stars that can can draw. And you're saying that Peacock might not be
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:16.560]   getting the best matches. It doesn't matter. It's just matches. It doesn't. If you're
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:21.200]   WWE, you have zero incentive to provide compelling matches or interesting matches because you're
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:25.120]   getting paid regard. It's like a salary versus being on commission. It's like, well, if I'm
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:31.040]   getting paid, I can pay it anyway. Anyway, if I'm on commission, I really got a hustle to earn that
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:34.880]   dollar. So this is, I'm going to watch this with interest. I think while I'm not so much
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:41.760]   interested in the content, it does sound like it's a great test tube for how a modern content company.
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:47.840]   Yes, I would very, again, it's wrestling. It's kind of who cares. But it's, it is literally a billion,
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:51.760]   billion dollar revenue company. You know, all the mainstream company, Wall Street Journal,
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:55.600]   all those guys cover it as you would cover it, Netflix or whatever. So if you were to approach
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:32:00.320]   it from that sort of angle and like, okay, I'm not going to watch SmackDown on Fridays, I mean,
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:03.840]   whatever. But like what the business is doing and how they're trying to navigate,
[00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:09.040]   you know, balance all the plates, streaming, broadcast, cable, they're an interesting
[00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:16.560]   entity to keep an eye on. Yeah. And NFTs. And they're trying that too. Yeah. And action figures.
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:21.600]   And on and on and on. I mean, this is potentially a very valuable property as long as you can,
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:26.480]   you know, keep people interested in it. Yeah. And the question now, you know, Vince McMahon,
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:33.280]   longtime CEO, Fatwell, he bought the company from his father, but CEO recently retired because
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:38.800]   of allegations. Grace. Yes. Yes. Yes. Hard in disgrace. So whatever. But now the question is like,
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:42.640]   who's buying this company? It's a very healthy business. They make money handover fist.
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:46.240]   You get pretty much runs on its own. You don't have to do anything. Again, the matches don't
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:50.960]   matter. You just put person A versus person B and NBC use paying you. So it doesn't matter.
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:54.880]   That's fascinating. Who's going to buy this? Yeah. And all the it's the usual
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:58.960]   containers. Well, NBC, you could just buy it. Why would they why would they keep paying rights fees
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:03.600]   every five years escalating rights fees when they can just own the whole thing from ADZ and
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:08.480]   never have to think of that again? Disney has been talked about. Is there a is there a stigma,
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:12.560]   though? Does it does it like does it feel like down market to some of these guys?
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:17.840]   That is all that has been the perception they've been trying to fight basically since I was a kid.
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:22.480]   I was like, this is this is rastling. This is this is you know, it's play acting. It's not,
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:27.760]   you know, it's not a sport. It's theater. Correct. And it's the fence. We were just discussing
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:34.320]   house of the dragon. Well, that's acting as well. Exactly. It's like what is more what is more real
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:39.120]   real if I want to watch real, I watch the NFL. If I want to watch like I've got two hours to kill
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:44.480]   who kind of cares how those hours are spent. So it's like, but yeah, to your point, it is it can
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:50.080]   be viewed as as kind of like, yeah, but they've they've done a good job over the past 10, 15 years
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:55.360]   of trying to like increase the caliber of the advertisers. And so they are they've been working
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:34:00.320]   at that. And now it is again, to me, it feels it's a matter of time until someone buys this thing.
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:05.600]   And then it's just like another P and L on NBC use kind of like conference call.
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:10.800]   You know, it's the kind of thing I think Apple might say, yeah, we're not going to buy rest.
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:16.320]   I would be surprised if Apple price W2B and I think I'm ashamed to say that. That's very snobby
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:22.960]   to say. I know I have lots of friends like you, Nicholas are big fans. And it's not down market,
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:26.160]   really, but I could see Apple saying, well, maybe it's not the right. It feels like a
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:30.560]   strange fit. Yeah. And they don't have a relationship anyway. W2B has had a relationship with NBC
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:36.000]   with USA network for 30 years or however long it's been. So they know each other and they've
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.640]   known each other. So to me, if it feels again, it feels inevitable, like it's a matter of time,
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:45.760]   someone buys because it is it is reliable revenue. And it kind of doesn't even matter. That's been,
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:50.960]   you know, if you ask fans like really hardcore fans over the past, let's let's say 10 years,
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:56.720]   W2B has more or less been unwatchable. It has been bad and people either people either hate
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:01.280]   watch it or they watch it because they've got podcasts and it's content for the podcast or
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:06.960]   like whatever. But like people really have not liked the product and it doesn't matter. It doesn't
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:13.840]   matter. The ratings are more or less okay. They get paid however they get paid. And it is like
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:18.160]   inelastic. It's like it doesn't matter. They could just produce like imagine releasing just like a
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:21.600]   bad album. That doesn't matter because the fans are going to buy it anyway. It's like, well,
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:27.520]   that's kind of what W2B has been living for a long while. The market's buying it too. They
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:32.080]   paid they paid 10 million in dividends in the second quarter. They just 10 million in share
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:36.800]   repurchases. That was their calling card for a while. They were very reliable dividends. It's like
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:42.800]   yeah, it's wrestling who cares. I get my 50 cents or whatever per share per quarter or whatever.
[00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:46.960]   Whatever it was. But yeah, they've been a very interesting company to kind of keep your eye on.
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:50.800]   Even if again, I think they're bellwesterly. I think that's what I'm interested in now and
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:55.120]   I will pay more attention to them because I think they're a bellwether for how a content company
[00:35:55.120 --> 00:36:02.480]   can navigate a very challenging time. I do give them credit for navigating this and doing pretty
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:08.000]   well. Again, the W2B network launched in 2014 with perhaps unrealist expectations, but they did
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:13.200]   course correct eventually. And they've got very smart people as they're saying, this guy Nick Khan,
[00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:19.120]   he's their new co-CEO. He feels to me like one of the smartest executives in like streaming
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:24.400]   or Hollywood or whatever. More people don't know him. People know David Zazlop. People know
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:29.120]   guys like that. People don't know Nick Khan. I feel like that's the name you're going to be
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:33.600]   hearing a lot more over the next couple years. Is Vince McMahon's daughter still?
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:40.640]   She's co-CEO. She's still there. Yes. She had stepped away for a leave of absence
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:44.480]   about a month before all this Vince McMahon stuff started happening. She left the company
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:49.680]   and she came back about three weeks later. So she's co-CEO and then her husband,
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:56.160]   the former Triple H wrestler, his name is Paul. He is now in charge of the creative aspects.
[00:36:56.160 --> 00:37:02.080]   That's not a good wrestler name. It should be the Undertaker Paul or Death Machine Paul or
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:06.640]   something. Paul. They've kind of got three executives kind of pulling the strings. The two
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:11.120]   co-CEOs running the business end and then Paul Levesque, the former Triple H, I guess the current
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:15.040]   Triple H, he's running back the wrestling storyline. Is this handled? Did he have a handle?
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:20.720]   His name was Triple H. Triple H. I first Helmsley. Awful. Just awful. No wonder he failed.
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:26.640]   He was my favorite when I was like 14, 15. Oh yes. And everyone hated him but he was a bad
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:31.040]   guy. He was a heel but I was as a real sweetheart. I always liked the bad guys. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:36.640]   Everybody does. That's yeah. So I actually had a question for Jason because you've seen 8K.
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:44.480]   So we it was a pretty steady progression from SD standard definition to HD,
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:53.920]   full, high def to UHD 4K. But I'm wondering if we're going to make that same step to 8K.
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:59.360]   I feel like the problem is content's going to get very, yes they're TVs but that content's going
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:04.800]   to get heavier and heavier. Do you think 8K is the next step, a logical step or is it,
[00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:11.920]   we don't need it any better than 4K? No, I think we do need better than 4K. Like 4K still doesn't
[00:38:11.920 --> 00:38:18.480]   isn't as good as the human eye. You know the human is as long as there's stuff that's going to be
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:24.880]   more like looking out a window and see you when you looked at it in Korea in South Korea,
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:32.480]   you could it was like, wow, this is a significant step up. That the soccer was. The soccer was.
[00:38:33.200 --> 00:38:37.600]   Yeah, I mean the other stuff like you know looking at beautiful pictures of mountains.
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:41.520]   Yeah, they always have the same crappy content. You know, here's a sea otter. Yeah, I know.
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:47.200]   That stuff. Look at the drops of water on his fur. It's incredible.
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:54.160]   Because a lot that's that was amazing in 4K too. And right, I don't really notice the
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:59.280]   difference. Well, and soccer I did. What you don't want to see is Lord of the Rings in 8K because
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:05.120]   Gandalf's staff looks like it came from you know, Wizards are us. It looks like a piece of plastic,
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:12.560]   which it is by the way. Now you're seeing it as it is. I'm a big fan of RuPaul's Drag Race and I
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:16.560]   think the drag queens would have words with you if you put them on a date. Yeah, let's not.
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:24.240]   Lose the magic. All the pores. All the pores. Yeah. No, I would say the soccer was the one thing
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:28.960]   that I was like, oh, okay. Sports makes a lot of sense. It really looked amazing. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:35.200]   Yeah. I've probably some big epic stuff. I spent a lot of money with YouTube TV with Google to get
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:40.720]   the Olympics in 4K and it really does look fantastic. I mean, it really it's much better for sports.
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:46.080]   Not so hard for other things. Jason, was that demo? Was that in a higher frame rate as well?
[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:51.040]   Or was that the? That's a good question. It was. It was in a much higher frame rate. That's why
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:55.360]   the soccer ball when it went across the screen. He was like, whoa, there's no blur. It was almost
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:40:03.600]   great. Yeah. So cool. So cool. Yeah. And you need a giant screen because of 8K on a 70 inch TV.
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:10.640]   Big deal, right? Yeah. Doesn't you're not going to tell. But this was 98 inches. It was 8K. It was
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:14.800]   high frame rate. Forgive me. I don't remember exactly what it was. But yeah, when it was,
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:18.960]   when the ball went across the screen, when the players were diving, you know, it was like,
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:25.760]   whoa, it's not blurry. Like all of a sudden he's not heard. I can see every inch. Yeah, exactly.
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:34.000]   See every grass stain on his socks. It was pretty it was pretty interesting. That was where I
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.760]   realized like, okay, this is better. The tool change there. I mean, we've got the TVs. We've got
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:43.920]   the cameras. Deliveries. A question mark. We don't really have a good way to deliver it at this point.
[00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:48.640]   But I guess we could solve that. We will remind me. It's a game with, it'll keep getting better.
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:54.800]   Yeah. I was just to say, at IFA, the big European kind of version of CES, in 2010, I was there and
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:41:05.200]   ESPN was announced 3D. They were going to do 3D. I think there's an official FIFA World Cup 2010
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:11.120]   Blu-ray or whatever in 3D. 3D. But that feels, you cannot, I think I might have had it at one point.
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:14.960]   You cannot go to the store today and buy a 3D TV. They're all gone. I still have one with the
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:20.160]   glasses, which are dusty as hell because I'm sitting behind the TV charging.
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:25.200]   Oh, those will work. We've never used them on this Panasonic Viera.
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:31.520]   Yeah, I think 3D even in movies. There's no, do they do 3D movies anymore?
[00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:37.600]   Yeah, they do. They still do 3D. Yeah. Yeah. They still offer most of the big movies in 3D.
[00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:44.080]   Like, Cine Mark is still big with 3D. I think some of the others are too. Rico. And, yeah.
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:49.840]   All right. Can we talk about speaking of 3D? Can we talk about Mark Zuckerberg's?
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:55.760]   Yes. When we come back, I want to take a break. But let's talk about Mark. I don't know what D
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:42:03.040]   that is. Is that a negative number? I don't know. Mark Zuckerberg's, what is it called? Horizon,
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:08.720]   New Horizon. What's the name of their virtual reality? Horizon World.
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:15.360]   Horizon World. Mark is Horizon World. As the Twitterverse said $10 billion for that, really.
[00:42:15.360 --> 00:42:21.920]   But before we do that, and I am so glad to have you guys as my panel today, Owen Thomas,
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:28.800]   from Protocol, from Consumer Reports, Nicholas De Leon, and the wonderful Jason Heiner from CDNet.
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:34.800]   I do want to talk about our sponsor for this segment of the show ExpressVPN, the only VPN I use,
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:40.880]   the only VPN I trust. When you go to the bathroom, you close the door behind you, right? They always
[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:45.760]   say, "Oh, well, you know, I have nothing to hide." You close the bathroom door, you have something to
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:53.120]   hide. You don't want random passerby's looking in saying, "Hey, so why would you let somebody watch
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:59.120]   you online using the internet without ExpressVPN's?" Like, go into the bathroom and not close in the
[00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:04.400]   door. And I'll tell you why. You're an internet service provider. They know every site you're going
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:09.120]   to. When you do a Google search, they know, they say, "Oh, hi, Leo. Sure, let me record all the
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:15.440]   things you search for because our advertisers would love to know that." And worse, lately, we're seeing
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:25.200]   governments buy that information from data brokers from third parties, subpoena that information from
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:32.480]   ISPs and sites like Facebook. You can get a lot of trouble for the stuff you're doing. In fact,
[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:36.720]   we've got a story coming up in just a little bit of how Google turned a guy's service off.
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:43.760]   ExpressVPN can put a stop to this. It creates a secure encrypted tunnel between your device
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:49.360]   and the internet so that your online activity can't be seen by anyone. Add companies, tech
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:55.280]   giants, the government. You can use it on your devices. There was just an article about how
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:44:01.920]   there's no point in using a VPN on iOS because Apple has cleverly designed iOS to leak data around
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:07.760]   your VPN. Well, there are ways, in fact, to use ExpressVPN on iOS and prevent that. But even better,
[00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:11.920]   put it on your router than it doesn't matter what your iPhone does. Everybody in the house is
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:19.200]   protected. ExpressVPN goes on every device. Many routers, smart TVs, phones, tablets,
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:24.400]   desktops, of course. You can protect everybody in your home. It's as easy as closing the bathroom
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:28.720]   door. You fire up the app, you click a button, you're protected because they have servers all
[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:33.040]   over the world. The performance is superior. And let me emphasize this because I think it's
[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:38.320]   important to know it's important to choose the right VPN provider because, yeah, sure, the VPN
[00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:42.320]   is protecting you from your ISP. But then they see everything the ISP would see, right? So you've
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:49.040]   got to find a VPN provider that cares about your privacy as much as you do. ExpressVPN does. It was
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:54.720]   just a great article about how Express does what they do. They have a custom version of Debian,
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:45:02.240]   the Linux distro that refreshes itself every day. So everything's wiped off. When you use the
[00:45:02.240 --> 00:45:10.160]   ExpressVPN, it fires up their trusted server in RAM sandbox. So it can't write to the hard drive.
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:15.360]   And as soon as you leave, it goes away. And so does every trace of your visit, they do everything
[00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:21.360]   possible to protect your privacy, no government, even if they seize the servers without a warrant,
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:26.160]   as happens sometimes, not in this country, but in other countries, no government can see what
[00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:31.120]   you've been doing with ExpressVPN. And we know that too, from many news stories about governments,
[00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:37.360]   seizing the servers, finding nothing on them. So very important. Number one VPN,
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:41.120]   according to Mashable, the Verge, countless others, the only one I use,
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:45.760]   if you want to protect your privacy, if you think your online activity should be your business
[00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:54.480]   and no one else is go to ExpressVPN.com/twit today. Expr ESS VPN.com, please use the slash
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:46:00.000]   twit. So they know you saw it here. And as a thank you, you'll get an extra three months free
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.880]   with your one year plan. That's the best deal, less than seven bucks a month. And you do want to
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:14.400]   pay for a VPN, because you want to be the customer, right? Not the product express VPN.com/twit.
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:22.080]   Thank you, ExpressVPN for your support of this week in tech. Zach so relieved.
[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:26.480]   When, when cyclical, I just want to say I get so relieved when you have products on here that
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:32.960]   I'm already using because I can reaffirm your choice. No, no, no, it's that the amount of money
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:38.560]   that I've spent when I come on the show over the years is astronomical because I find out about
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:43.040]   new product because you pick good products and you and then I'm like, Oh, shoot. Okay, I want to
[00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:47.600]   try it. I think the list of things that I've tried is definitely like in the dozens that, you know,
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:53.920]   from from Twitter. So I should really write you a I should write you a testimonial Jason Heiner,
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:58.080]   editor in chief CD net says, yes, I buy all that crap. Everything.
[00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:08.960]   Here is, let's see a picture of Mark Zuckerberg. In his new virtual reality environment,
[00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:15.600]   they call it Horizon Worlds, where here's his Instagram, we're launching Horizon Worlds in France
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:19.440]   and Spain. They're looking forward to seeing people explore and build immersive worlds.
[00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:25.280]   And then there's a picture of the of a kind of a weak picture of the Eiffel Tower standing nowhere.
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:30.000]   I don't know what this is, something in Spain. Is that supposed to be less agrada familia? I guess
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:36.720]   it is. It's just so terrible. I can't tell. And who the hell is that? Is that a space alien? No,
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:43.920]   it's like himself. Of course, immediately became a meme on Twitter and elsewhere saying he spent 10
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:51.200]   billion dollars for this. 10 billion dollars last year alone. I thought you were going to talk about
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:56.480]   that motherboard story of him in the I will I will that's next. That's next. I am. I'm going
[00:47:56.480 --> 00:48:00.400]   to talk about that too. I'm not sure which one you wanted to talk about. I want to see. Do you
[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:08.800]   want to talk about this? Horizon Worlds? Yes. I mean, the, you know, the basically the fact that
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:14.000]   Mark Zuckerberg got cyber bullied into it. He did upgrade to so he upgraded. Is this better?
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:18.880]   At least well, okay. So look at this one. Hair, no texture. It's painted on his head.
[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:25.280]   I don't know what's going on with the eyes. That's not his mouth. It's a very attractive
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:31.200]   mouse, but it's not his mouth. Here's the new improved texture in the hair. His eyes aren't quite
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:37.520]   as massive. He looks like maybe his nose. He was broken a couple of times. Maybe it's writing
[00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:41.120]   that surfboard with the flag. I don't know how he did that. And the math does look a little
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:47.520]   more like his although he still has this kind of worse. If you think about the uncanny valley
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:55.440]   theory, it's a very yeah, but it's kind of falling in that trough of like, you know, still not
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:49:01.280]   realistic enough. He posted on Instagram saying, I know that photo I posted earlier this week was
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:07.200]   pretty basic, which by the way, in Zuck World, basic is about the worst thing you could be. It's
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:17.120]   pretty basic. So I hear is a better one. He said, I just took it real quickly. Major updates to
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:21.280]   Horizon and Avatar graphics coming soon. I'll share more and connect. Also, I know the photo I
[00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:25.680]   posted earlier this week was pretty basic. It was taken very quickly to celebrate a launch.
[00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:31.120]   Mark, you're one of the richest men in the world. You own outright one of the biggest companies in
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:37.120]   the world. It was taken very quickly. We were in a rush. The graphics and horizon are capable
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:42.080]   of much more even on headsets. And actually, I have to say, whatever this is down at the bottom,
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:47.280]   that's that's a little more suitable. It looks like some Greek rule. Sure. Yeah.
[00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:55.040]   I'm still not I've got to tell you, not gonna spend a minute in the horizon worlds.
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:50:00.720]   I feel the same way. I feel and again, I'm a huge gamer. If you if you leave me to my devices,
[00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:08.880]   I'll play switch or PS5 all day. I don't know about this horizon and whole metaverse thing.
[00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:15.440]   So which VR games you played? You use a quest or? I have a quest to the new one. I
[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:22.080]   played Arizona Sunshine, the zombie game when it came out. I'm not soup. They're not. I don't
[00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:27.840]   find the games to be very good. And so I don't really play half life was good. Half life Alex,
[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:32.240]   which came out. Yeah, because those things, the face suckers that I didn't play it, but I
[00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:38.800]   didn't imagine those to be really scary in VR like jumping out. But the yeah, I'm more of a
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:44.720]   traditional either PC or console gamer or I'd frankly just rather ride my bike than like horizon
[00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:49.200]   worlds or whatever. And I don't know like I get I think I brought this point up one of the
[00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:53.680]   previous times I was on. I don't know that there's an amount of money you could give my adopted mother
[00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:59.200]   where she would spend any amount of time in horizon using her as an example of a real person.
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:04.000]   Yeah, she's an actual person with a normal job. She's a professor. This is fundamentally
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:09.120]   uninteresting to her. And if it's under sick to her and under sick to me as a giant nerd gamer,
[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:15.600]   who is like I don't know who is hyped about this. I don't know you guys protocol had a I thought
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:22.240]   a really interesting interview with the product lead at Roblox, Josh Anan. I don't know if this is
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:28.480]   real name, but they're doing it too. Roblox is going to do last week the company has to big step
[00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:34.320]   forward for its work on graphical fidelity with an update to the materials at Lee. It lets its users
[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:40.560]   create virtual worlds out of boy, if anybody could succeed in a virtual environment, it would be
[00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:48.880]   Roblox, right? So I don't know if the graphics are the key thing. I mean, is it you know, is it more
[00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:53.440]   the the gameplay of the virtual world? I mean, that seems to be what makes that's true of any game.
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:52:00.000]   It's true of any game. Otherwise people wouldn't play a bit games, right? It's the game. Yeah.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:09.440]   And horizon worlds isn't really a game. So, you know, well, that's true too. It's a social. Yeah,
[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:15.600]   it's a social, but is it not the case that that this is meta's future? Like there this is
[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:22.080]   all their hopes and fears and prayers are in this box called virtual reality.
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:27.920]   Remember when Facebook was like where you went to play games, you know, like a farm
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:30.720]   fabulous. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:36.640]   They more or less, you know, just walked away from that entire market. I think if you are a
[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:42.240]   game maker, though, you're going to have long memories of that period and think really long and
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:49.200]   hard if you want to have that same company as your partner in building out games on top of
[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:59.120]   horizon world. I'm also not crazy about the idea of a company owning my metaverse. Like
[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:04.640]   who's metaverse are you in? Are you in the Robox metaverse or in the Facebook metaverse?
[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:11.920]   It feels like it shouldn't be like that, right? That's why Nvidia is trying to do what it's
[00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:18.320]   doing with this or what they're calling the Nieverse, which is this kind of cross platform
[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:24.320]   metaverse. And then they have quietly partnered with Pixar and Apple. There you go.
[00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:32.640]   And so if Apple does a headset, you know, worst kept secret in tech world, you know, in January
[00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:40.160]   or somewhere around there, you know, perhaps it's built on this platform. So that that's interesting.
[00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:50.640]   I do agree that people have lock in fatigue. I think and so something like the metaverse feels like
[00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:58.000]   I think something that people are going to really worry about being just locked into an ecosystem.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:02.880]   Here's Nvidia's drive sim, which Nvidia, as you know, is very much into autonomous vehicles.
[00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:09.440]   This is designed for you to test your autonomous vehicles. This is, I actually recognize this
[00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:14.560]   tunnel. This is a tunnel I would drive every day to get from San Francisco to Marin.
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:21.840]   The Robin Williams tunnel, I think it's called. Yeah. Yeah. This looks pretty good. I mean, I,
[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:26.880]   this I could see maybe for a driving game or something like that. Yeah. Oh, actually,
[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:31.760]   I guess it's in Germany now. Suddenly we're in Germany. Come out of the tunnel in Germany.
[00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:34.320]   Far, far, far enough to auto bond.
[00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:39.760]   Okay. So they got the technology. Certainly they got the hardware.
[00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:45.120]   I do think it says, oh, and said until there's a compelling experience, even that's the one
[00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:51.360]   asterisk I'll put on my like, you know, ecosystem lock in comment. Like, is if there's an experience
[00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:58.240]   that a lot of people want, they'll probably, they may throw that to the wind, you know, at least
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:03.840]   initially to have an experience that they're really interested in. I think that's why you can
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:10.560]   argue that maybe Apple Arcade, which has been moderately successful for Apple, why it hasn't
[00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:17.280]   perhaps been more successful is it's never had that one must play experience that a lot of people
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:22.400]   want to go there for, even though I think they've taken some swings at that. I think it'll be the
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:27.200]   same for the metaverse too. Like it's a, it's a hit, it's a hit space business. And until there's
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:32.480]   something that a lot of people want to go there and do, it'll be, it'll, it'll, it probably won't see
[00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:40.640]   much action. Yeah, it's going to be it's like 3D TV. It's just that every company in the world
[00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:45.200]   spending billions of dollars hoping it's going to be the next big thing, but there's no guarantee, right?
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:51.520]   So let's, let's now go to LACMA, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.
[00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:56.720]   Eric's King, who is a product designer at Riot Games on a date with his girlfriend at the
[00:55:56.720 --> 00:56:01.840]   Los Angeles County Museum of Art. They were viewing an exhibition called the Archive of the World
[00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:10.640]   Art and Imagination in Spanish America, 1500 to 1800. King saw something he'd not expect to see,
[00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:18.640]   a sculpture entitled Virgin of Mercy or Pilgrim of Keto. Take a look. Baby Mark.
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:25.760]   Same hair, same eyes. He actually looks a lot like the Horizon World's Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:32.880]   He took a picture course and called Motherboard or tweeted it. I don't know. Somehow he let
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:36.800]   Motherboard know. I remember leaning over to my girlfriend and whispering in her ear,
[00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:41.440]   not to annoy other visitors. It looked just like Zuckerberg. She ended up laughing so hard.
[00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:46.160]   My attempt not to interrupt the space wasn't very effective.
[00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:54.240]   I guess Mark is probably the last guy in the world to have a Caesar cut haircut. So
[00:56:55.120 --> 00:57:00.000]   maybe it's no accident. Baby's suck. That's the one you wanted to look at, right on?
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:08.720]   Exactly. It's the same uncanny valley of act. It is. It's about the same quality of execution.
[00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:15.200]   Well, I don't know if Mark Zuckerberg is the reincarnation of the Pilgrim of Keto,
[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:20.400]   but there's definitely some people in LACMA who think he's...
[00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:25.600]   Reminds me of the Chinese doppelganger for Elon Musk. I'm sure you've talked about this on the
[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:30.800]   show before. Oh, no. In December. Yeah, look up Chinese doppelganger for Elon Musk.
[00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:40.240]   This one is pretty wild. Let's see here. There's a guy in China who looks just like Elon Musk.
[00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:46.080]   Actually, this story says he has been suspended from TikTok and Twitter. Well, he does look just
[00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:53.520]   like he's the guy on the left. You might be puzzled. His name, Yilong Ma, got suspended on
[00:57:53.520 --> 00:58:02.160]   Weibo and Doyin this week because Musk has previously said I would like to meet him in person.
[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:08.880]   He went viral playing, I guess, playing Elon Musk.
[00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:19.920]   And the Chinese authorities did not like it. Oh, his username is Elon Musk.
[00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:32.400]   239,000 followers on TikTok. 3.9 million likes. Wow. So TikTok is the last place he can be.
[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:41.680]   Yeah, it's interesting. All right. Real news, real stories. How about this one?
[00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:54.480]   New York Times this morning. Wow. What a story. It starts with a young father who has a child
[00:58:54.480 --> 00:59:01.760]   who's not feeling it all well. They call the doctor. The doctor says, "What's the problem?" He says,
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:07.040]   "Well, there's some swelling in his intimate parts." The doctor says, "Well, send me a picture."
[00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:12.960]   Cashmere Hill had the story. This is a Friday night in February of 2021.
[00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:19.680]   The nurse said, "Send photos so the doctor can review them." Mark's wife, as happens, by the way,
[00:59:19.680 --> 00:59:24.080]   all the time, especially during COVID. Mark's wife grabbed her husband's phone, texted a few
[00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:30.000]   high quality close-ups of their son's groin area to her iPhone so she could upload them to the
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:34.480]   healthcare provider's messaging system. In one of them, Mark's hand was visible,
[00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:40.640]   helping to better display the swelling. That was that with help from the photos. The doctor
[00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:45.040]   diagnosed the issue, prescribed antibiotics. The kids feeling much better. However,
[00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:55.840]   however, a couple of days later, his Gmail account is shut down. He's a Google Fi user. He
[00:59:55.840 --> 01:00:02.480]   loses his, not only his email, but his phone number. It turns out his Android camera had backed up
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:08.480]   his photos to the Google Cloud. Google's CSAM child sexual abuse materials scanner,
[01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:18.320]   automatedly recognized it, sent it to Nickmic, the national center for missing and exploited children.
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:24.000]   Nickmic, of course, it didn't match anything in their existing database, so they had a human look
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:30.960]   at it. Human said, "Yeah, that's CSAM." And Google immediately took down his account because of
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:37.200]   "harmful content" that was a "severe violation of Google's policies and might be illegal." Furthermore,
[01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:45.360]   they referred his name to the San Francisco Police Department. It's kind of ironic because the father
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:50.720]   was a software engineer working on an automated tool for taking down video content flagged by
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:57.520]   who's this problematic. Who better to understand how this worked? He filled out a form requesting a
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:04.400]   review of Google's decision explaining what had happened. Google said, "No."
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:12.880]   That's it. We are not going to reinstate the account, no further explanation.
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:17.040]   What he did not know is the SFPD had started an investigation.
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:26.160]   The SFPD eventually cleared him. In fact, he received in the mail a Manila envelope in December,
[01:01:26.160 --> 01:01:31.280]   so this started in February, so eight months, nine months later, he got a Manila, actually 10
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:35.360]   months later, he got a Manila envelope in the mail from the SFPD with a letter saying,
[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:39.120]   "You've been investigated. Copies of the search warrant were in there,
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:45.200]   served on Google and his ISP. They got everything." An investigator whose contact information was
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:51.680]   provided got Mark's internet searches, his location history, his messages, any documents,
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:58.640]   photos and videos he'd stored with Google. The investigator, at least, was intelligent enough
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:04.800]   to look at it and say, "Yeah, no, I understand what happened." I determined this is the quote
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:08.240]   in the report. I determined the incident did not meet the elements of a crime. No crime occurred.
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:16.640]   So the father sent this back to Google saying, "Can I have my account back?" Google said, "No."
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:23.920]   His account was permanently deleted, as was his fine number. So he lost his email,
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:28.080]   lost his fine number, lost all the documents, lost all the photos. Everything stored on Google.
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:32.640]   He says, "I spoke to a lawyer about suing, how much it would cost." He says,
[01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:37.120]   "I decided I wasn't worth the $7,000. I would have had to give the attorney."
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:46.560]   Look, no one supports child pornography or child sexual abuse material, but this is exactly the
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:53.680]   problem when Apple proposes that EFF and others pointed out this false positive that can have a
[01:02:53.680 --> 01:03:02.320]   devastating effect on your life. Even if you provide evidence that there was nothing going on wrong,
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:09.280]   his decade old Google account gone. He was a paying user of Google's web services gone.
[01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:13.120]   And this is the most humiliating. He now has to use hotmail for his email address.
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:19.600]   I'm being silly. It's horrible. It's horrible.
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:25.040]   The irony is that the San Francisco Police Department is being more helpful than Google.
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:30.400]   They have a copy of one of the parents that Cashmer Hill wrote about in this article
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:36.560]   of his Google account. They're trying to get that data back to him,
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:44.480]   which again is more than Google is doing. I think this may be a case where regulation is called for,
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:52.960]   where if you can get cleared by a police department or other law enforcement agency in an investigation
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:04:00.960]   and present that evidence, Google should not be able to make a determination that's above and
[01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:07.360]   beyond what the police have found. That seems like Google appointing itself as the police.
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:11.360]   Yeah, it's kind of sad you have to go to the San Francisco Police Department and say,
[01:04:11.360 --> 01:04:18.320]   "Can I have my data because Google won't give it to me?" Wow. It does raise the issue, though.
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:22.320]   Remember, when you take pictures on your device, whether it's an iPhone or an Android phone,
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:26.640]   you may well be uploading it to servers where it's going to be scanned.
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:32.960]   And in fact, as soon as Google saw that, they scanned everything else. They went through
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:37.520]   everything he had on the Google servers. And I'm sure Apple would do exactly the same thing.
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:44.000]   Yeah, there are a couple of things. Go ahead, Jason, and then Owen.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:49.600]   I was just going to say, there are a couple of takeaways from this. One is just what you said,
[01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:56.080]   Leo, like, you have to be really thoughtful about photos that you take for that reason.
[01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:05.360]   I think the other is that this is the kind of thing when these companies act and don't have a good
[01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:18.000]   system for appeal or a rational system for appealing what is clearly a mistaken, a bad filter.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:24.880]   And I've been a part of this. I could tell a story about it that was just ridiculous on its
[01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:30.640]   face with YouTube. But this is where there's so much so many calls for regulation because
[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:37.760]   this is again where institutions running over individuals, this is where you start to run into
[01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:41.920]   people really having the sense that we need to regulate big tech companies because they control
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:47.680]   so much of the universe now. And so there has to be guardrails put in place so that they can't just
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:53.840]   act with impunity, do these things to individuals that have real effects on their lives and then
[01:05:53.840 --> 01:06:00.320]   have to be completely flip about not having a good appeals process for them if they are flagged
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:04.480]   falsely? So it's interesting. I'm watching the chatroom and some people in the chatroom saying,
[01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:10.080]   well, he did that. It's illegal what he did. And Google had the right to go through it.
[01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:15.840]   Perhaps they agree that Google should restore it now. But nothing Google did was inappropriate.
[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:24.800]   I disagree. I mean, the government couldn't do this without warrants. So the police department
[01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:28.400]   had to get warrants. They had to go to a court. They had to go to a judge. They did all that.
[01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:34.160]   Google didn't. The police department literally found that no crime had been committed. So how
[01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:41.200]   I don't understand the viewers who are saying that it wasn't a crime. It wasn't a crime.
[01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:46.480]   And I can tell you right now, I mean, I've said, well, maybe I shouldn't talk about this.
[01:06:46.480 --> 01:06:54.000]   But it's not unusual for a doctor to say send me pictures, especially during COVID. This was
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:01.520]   standard practice. I don't know what you're supposed to do as a parent. And it's appalling.
[01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:09.040]   I think actually there is an opportunity for, you know, for doctors to create maybe secure,
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:17.920]   you know, regulated apps that are like single purpose. And their safety, like the image never
[01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:24.000]   gets stored on a server except one that the doctor has access to. It's auto deleted after
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.320]   the doctor reviews it. You know, I think I think actually there's some smart technology that can
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:35.520]   be applied to like this specific scenario. But I think there's also some, some logic to saying,
[01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:42.480]   just bring the kid into the doctor, you know, even if the doctor says, oh, just take a photo, like, no.
[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:48.560]   Yeah, or video maybe do it. But I know that there are some of these these like
[01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:57.680]   EMR systems that now have these like encrypted video chat or photo upload, which is likely related
[01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:04.800]   to some of these regent reasons. But I also wonder to like, there's all kinds of opportunities for
[01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:10.640]   false positives. What if you're taking a, you know, baby's first bath and you're given the kid a
[01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:16.640]   pass and you take a photo and you send it to the grandparents, right? You can imagine a scenario,
[01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:22.880]   tons of scenarios like that. Maybe their algorithms are smart enough to know the difference of that.
[01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:29.360]   Because I have to think that's likely very common. But but it still sort of raises the question of
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:36.880]   like, could that become a case where you're, you know, have a false positive for child exploitation?
[01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:43.440]   Yeah. To me, it's a strong argument against using automated tools for this. I understand there's a
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:50.480]   problem with child pornography. I don't know how widespread it is. Last year, Google filed 600,000
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:58.160]   600,000 reports of child abuse material and disabled the accounts of 270,000 users.
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:08.080]   Whoa. Are all 270,000 people child pornographers? If it's that widespread, I guess we've got a
[01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:18.400]   problem. I don't think it is. Wow. I just, I understand these companies would far rather
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:27.840]   cut off, let's say 100,000 people wrongly, than be pilloried in the press for, you know,
[01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:35.120]   allowing child pornographers to exist. But in fact, I have a feeling there's quite a bit of
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:44.480]   underground child pornography being circulated on these servers that they're not effectively
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:50.480]   getting rid of. It's just shocking to me. Can I ask? I haven't read the full article. Did Google
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:56.080]   provide comment to Kashmir? Did they say they offer any explanation? No. Oh, yes. No, no, they did.
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:10:00.800]   Oh, what they say? Oh, yeah, they did. Oh, okay. Here we go. They stood by their decision.
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:08.400]   And really, okay. Basically, they emphasized the importance of, you know, stopping the online
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:13.440]   spread of child sex sexual abuse material. Even after the police cleared this guy,
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:19.440]   they said police cleared this guy. They, I agree with you, Owen. That seems to me that like,
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:24.000]   is Google now, do they outrank the police? Like we have law enforcement agencies.
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:28.720]   Oh, my, I don't know. I have zero insight. I feel like this is the type of thing Google's
[01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:32.000]   probably scrambling to like figure out how, you know, what happened. They're going to reinstate
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:38.240]   the guy now. Yeah, but that's crazy that they kind of like in a statement. This is talk about an
[01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:42.000]   an anemic statement in a statement. Google said this is from Kashmir health article,
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:46.480]   child sexual abuse material is abhorrent. And we're committed to preventing the spread of it on
[01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:53.360]   our platforms. That's it. Yeah. All right. A few days after Mark filed the appeal, Google
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:58.800]   responded, it will not reinstate the account. No further explanation. That is, that is a stock
[01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:03.440]   response. Of course, child sexual abuse is material is abhorrent. That's not what this was.
[01:11:03.440 --> 01:11:09.680]   Yeah. Exactly. It reminds me of the, you know, in the movie, Scrooge, where Bill Murray plays the
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:14.720]   media executives and, you know, something happens and then the press calls and he's like,
[01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:18.240]   we had, I don't see her shocked shocked. I've chucked. Yes.
[01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:27.280]   Oh, sometimes I just hate corporations. I don't know what, what, what to say about it. All right,
[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:37.040]   moving, moving on. We can move on. Update your iPad, iPad, OS and Mac OS, zero day in the wild.
[01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:44.400]   Two vulnerabilities found in WebKit, the browser engine that powers Safari because of it powering
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:50.560]   Safari, it means it powers everything else on the iPhone. The two flaws affect iPad, OS,
[01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:58.720]   iOS, Mac OS, Monterey, maliciously crafted web content. So you go to a website with those devices,
[01:11:58.720 --> 01:12:03.920]   could lead to arbitrary code execution with kernel privileges.
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:14.000]   And apparently some successful exploits such as powerful nation state spyware are using these
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:20.720]   vulnerabilities to break through devices, layers of protection. So if you saw that update and you're
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:30.320]   saying, well, do I need to do it? Yeah, you do. Wow. My, my friends and I were, we're commenting on
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:37.040]   how this like ripped through the, all the family chat threads and like, you know, the, you know,
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:40.640]   like, yeah, because there's people like you who have to now tell everybody,
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:48.000]   mom, dad, do this, they need to know and they may not even know I,
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:53.280]   whoever's the, whoever's the, you know, de facto family, I T per.
[01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:57.280]   Right. Well, and that's why I mentioned it here. I know everybody who watches our shows are,
[01:12:57.280 --> 01:13:02.720]   are geeky and they probably, I mean, I'm sure they've already applied the patch, but just tell
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:09.760]   everybody else, you need to do this. All right, little break. We'll come back with more, our fabulous
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:16.000]   panel. Jason Heiner. I like seeing you every time I see you, Jason, I get a, I get a little
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:25.600]   smile on my, my heart. ZD net editor in chief. It's also nice to see people succeed. And you have,
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:32.080]   and I do like it also that you have a Twit Fez and an original iMac. That was, was that the first
[01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:37.120]   one, the original? The Mac classic. That was the Mac classic. So it was like, you know,
[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:45.040]   basically a third generation of the early Macs. I wish I still had my Mac from 1984 that I spent
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:53.440]   2000. You have yours, John. I bought it at Macy's because I had to charge it because I couldn't
[01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:59.440]   afford a $2,400 computer, but I can charge it on my Macy's card. So I got my first Mac in '84,
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:06.400]   I think March of '84 at Macy's. You too, John? And you, but you saved yours. What was I thinking?
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:13.680]   What a fool. I worked, I worked two jobs over the summer of before my senior year of high school
[01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:19.040]   to buy that because it was the same one we used in the journalism lab. And, and so that I could
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:24.960]   do some of my work at home. It's so cute. Are you kids old enough to be buying computers yet?
[01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:32.320]   My daughter just, just on Friday bought her first phone with her first money. She's 16. So
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:37.680]   she bought, she got an iPhone 11 in purple. Smart. Yeah. Perfect.
[01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:45.680]   Purple iPhone. Perfect. Our 19 year old announced this morning because he just got a job at Safeway.
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:49.520]   It's his second job. He said, I picked out the computer I'm going to buy.
[01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:57.600]   It like kind of goes around. You get, you know, you work those jobs, you save up the first thing
[01:14:57.600 --> 01:15:02.000]   you do, you save up enough money. By the way, the computer, he's going to buy a Corsair gaming
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.080]   machine a little bit more than that.
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:13.440]   That was $1,500. He's ambitious. His mom, my wife said, maybe you should look at car insurance before
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:17.520]   you, before you bought that computer. Oh, and what were you going to say?
[01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:25.680]   I just remember, I graduated high school like right before the class came out. And so we were
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:33.360]   stuck buying an SE 30, which was like, more expensive. But that SE 30 lasted, man. I used
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:40.080]   was this 30? Because it had a 30 megabyte hard drive. I think it was a 60 to 30 chip. Yeah.
[01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:42.880]   68, 68030. Okay. That was the 30.
[01:15:42.880 --> 01:15:47.200]   The SE 30 was actually what we had in the journalism lab. Now that you say it, Owen,
[01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:51.760]   and the classic was like, essentially was the SE 30, the sort of, you know,
[01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:57.360]   polished version of it or more. Yeah, it's recognizable because it had those,
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:06.480]   the slots in the front. They looked like fins. Yeah. I'm just curious. Wow. It was $4,369 in 1989,
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:14.560]   which is equivalent to $9,550. Today, holy cow, had a megabyte of RAM. You could get all the way up
[01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:24.000]   to 128. These are megabytes kids, megabytes of RAM. I had a friend who bought a 40 megabyte hard
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:29.360]   drive to external hard drive to get what he was in. I can't even remember. It's like 800 bucks at
[01:16:29.360 --> 01:16:34.960]   least or $1,200 or something. And I remember somebody telling him, you'll never use that much space.
[01:16:34.960 --> 01:16:38.640]   Yeah. You never have enough data to ever use all of that.
[01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:50.160]   What was your first Nicholas? My first, my first Mac was the second gen iMac. I got it in early 2002.
[01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:55.840]   And my first computer was some Packard Bell. Oh, God.
[01:16:55.840 --> 01:17:02.960]   piece of junk in 1996. I remember those. I remember those 95. It was a, it was a frank
[01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:08.000]   inside of a machine. I still have the iMac in my dad's basement, actually, with the original
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:12.320]   everything. I turned it on a couple of years ago. I still have all my high school essays.
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:18.080]   Oh, that's awesome. Oh, you actually keep that awesome. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that's awesome. That's great.
[01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:24.560]   All right. Let's take a break. Come back. Lots more to talk about. Also here, Nicholas De Leon,
[01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:31.680]   Consumer Reports. He is their senior electronics reporter. So I guess that just covers a,
[01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:36.000]   you could do answering machines as well as computers.
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:41.120]   I would love to do all sorts of wacky tech. Yeah. It's funny. We're still electronics. It's not
[01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:46.240]   technology. Even though we write about everything that any traditional technology publication would
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:55.440]   write about. I mostly cover laptops and like Wi-Fi stuff. I have been a proud subscriber for, I don't
[01:17:55.440 --> 01:18:02.000]   know, 30 years. I wonder, I should log in and see if they say, I can't say that about protocol.
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:06.320]   I've been a proud subscriber for six months.
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:12.000]   Now I'm in the middle of a login and I said something.
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:18.720]   Don't say anything, Leo, or you'll mess up your password. I already did. Never mind.
[01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:23.520]   I'll take a break and I'll tell you, coming up. Our show today brought to you by Zipper
[01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:30.800]   Cruder. We just hired somebody with Zipper Cruder. I'm trying to remember who, oh yeah.
[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:37.280]   She starts Monday. Yeah, Viva. She starts Monday. And that's a great name, isn't it? Viva?
[01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:44.560]   Zipper Cruder is the smartest way to hire it. We believe it because we use it.
[01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:50.720]   Look, you're a business owner and at summertime, the last thing you want to do is be spending your,
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:54.160]   you could be at the pool. You don't want to be going through unqualified candidates
[01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:58.800]   for that job. You could be having a barbecue. You could be on vacation. You could be redoing
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:02.320]   your deck. You could be gardening. You could be watching House of Dragons. But no,
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:08.400]   your inbox is full. Your voicemail is full because you didn't use Zipper Cruder. You need to use

[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:34.240]   she found a wonderful job. So she left. But that left us with a gaping hole in our continuity
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:40.000]   department. Lisa runs to Zipper Cruder because she knows it's the fastest way to hire. Plus,

[01:19:55.440 --> 01:20:00.480]   in their database, they have millions of resumes that match and they send their names to you and
[01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:04.560]   say, "Look, here's be some good people." And then you invite them. Now, I have to tell you,
[01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:09.040]   when you invite somebody to apply to a job, they are so flattered. It really is a great way to make

[01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:29.120]   And I have to tell you, we're very happy. Viva is not the first person we hired at
[01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:33.200]   Three Zipper Cruder. We found many of our best staff members of Zipper Cruder. You can too.

[01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:58.240]   because that's what we use. Zipcruder. I'm very happy with the zip. With the zip.
[01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:08.880]   I gotta try. One more time. My consumer reports password. I think it's monkey123. I think that's
[01:21:08.880 --> 01:21:14.720]   the problem. I think it's an old... I've been a member for so long. Does it say? I feel like it says.
[01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:20.960]   I don't know off-hand. Yeah. My benefits, my products, my feed account settings.
[01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:27.920]   Member... Oh yeah. Member since 2001. 21 years since before you were born, Nicholas.
[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:35.280]   Wow. I'll say I spoke to a guy yesterday, the other day. He has been a CR subscriber. I think
[01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:40.880]   he said since the 80s. I was like, "Wow. That actually might be before." I'm sure I was a subscriber
[01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:46.800]   before 2001 because I know in the 80s and 90s I would get the baggage. I'd go through and I
[01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:53.120]   wouldn't buy a thing without looking at CR first. That's how my parents were too. I've heard the
[01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:58.000]   previous design with the red circles. Love it. It's green now.
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:08.000]   Well, you are, thank you for the job you do. You are vital. Maybe you want to tell your readers
[01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:15.280]   to stay away. You mentioned your Packard Bell machine. You might want to
[01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:26.160]   stay away from laptops from a variety of companies, but older Windows XP laptops.
[01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:33.840]   This is from a post by Raymond Chen who is a Microsoft Chief Software Engineer.
[01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:41.680]   The story of what happens when those older laptops play the music video for Janet Jackson's Rhythm
[01:22:41.680 --> 01:22:46.720]   Nation. Now, I would play it, but YouTube will immediately take us down. I'll just leave that as
[01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:52.480]   an exercise for the listener. A major computer manufacturer, probably Packard Bell. I'm thinking,
[01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:57.760]   I don't know. I'm just saying, discover that when you play-
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:01.280]   It was such a bad computer. I wouldn't be surprised. Let's put it that way.
[01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:06.080]   That when you play rhythm nation, certain models of their laptop would crash.
[01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:08.480]   And they couldn't figure out why.
[01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:15.920]   So it also crashed the competitors' laptops. Eventually they figured out what's in common.
[01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:24.720]   Oh, it's this particular model of 5,400 RPM laptop hard drives. The song has a resonant frequency
[01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:30.400]   that causes a vibration in the drive that causes it to crash.
[01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:36.000]   So this manufacturer fixed it by putting in a filter in the audio pipeline that removes that
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:39.600]   frequency. I don't know if that made rhythm nations sound terrible, but
[01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:51.200]   and then he mentions also a similar situation that happened with another laptop
[01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:59.440]   and resonance. A Microsoft developer revealed that playing the game 101 monochrome mazes.
[01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:06.960]   I don't remember this one. Would reliably crash the machine because the speaker trace
[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:12.240]   was so close to the reset trace when it got vibrating on reset the computer.
[01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:19.440]   So if you know what, it's so funny because these are such old computers, but I bet you
[01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:23.920]   there are people listening to go, yeah, I never could play that game. I thought it was something
[01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:34.320]   wrong in the game. Wow. So I would love right now to play rhythm nation and see if any of your
[01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:41.840]   computers crash, but let's hope you are not still using Windows XP. Raymond Chen posting at
[01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:48.160]   Microsoft blog, the old new thing. I love it when these guys tell anecdotes from the...
[01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:54.800]   You probably couldn't tell the story then because it would have looked bad for that company, but now
[01:24:54.800 --> 01:25:02.240]   it's okay. We mentioned that tonight is the House of Dragons. I didn't mention though all the
[01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:14.080]   fabulous tie-ins to get you to watch this show. T-shirts, there's Funko pops, there's bar wear.
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:21.840]   You can buy, believe it or not, at the Warner Brothers Shop Artisanal Serving Planks.
[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:32.400]   Game of Thrones houses burnt into the serving plank. I think everyone, everyone should have such a thing.
[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:40.240]   As your next sponsor, Leo. You know what? If it's half the dragon Funko pops, I'm there. I'm
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:49.360]   with you. I'm with you. There's Visera's Targaryen. There's the Alice at High Tower, Damon Targaryen
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:55.120]   and R-- Oh, sorry. I got to sign up and save. Why does Warner Brothers logo still have the water
[01:25:55.120 --> 01:26:03.360]   tank? Come on guys. That is not the best way to represent your company. That's ridiculous.
[01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:08.160]   Is that in LA? That must be on their back lot somewhere. What are their House of Dragon things?
[01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:13.360]   Here's an exclusive House of Dragon beverage glass set. A jacket?
[01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:19.360]   Do you think they're going to judge this show on whether, you know, orders fly in?
[01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:25.360]   Here's a T-shirt that says, "History does not remember blood. It remembers names."
[01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:31.840]   I'm not wearing that. I don't even know what that means. I'm not wearing that.
[01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:41.360]   What other-- Well, you mentioned wrestling. Oh, yes. I was waiting for this.
[01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:49.840]   AEW Dynamite brought back Ricky, the dragon, Steamboat. He's 69. So he won't be wrestling.
[01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:53.200]   He will be-- Still better than half the guys today.
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:27:00.800]   Probably is. He can take a pile driver like no one else. He will be the special guest timekeeper.
[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:05.840]   Does that mean he rings the bell? What does that mean? Yes. For a match between the American
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:12.640]   Dragon, Brian Danielson, and Daniel Garcia-- Oh, that happened. Oh, it's over. That was last
[01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:17.680]   Wednesday. Yeah. Was it a great-- Oh, yeah. It was Wednesday. Yeah. Daniel Garcia did not have a
[01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:22.000]   dragon nickname, but decided he should have some. So he created a nickname for himself,
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:28.720]   the dragon's lair, and renamed his Scorpion Deathlock to-- was it good? Is that a good move?
[01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:34.560]   To the dragon tamer. Yeah. Well, Daniel's been the American Dragon for like 20 years.
[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:40.320]   Oh, yeah. He's been his nickname for ever, basically. Yeah. Yeah. A bit of weird corporate,
[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:47.120]   whatever. But they're on TBS. It's all Warner Brothers Discovery, and it feels slightly--
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:52.560]   like, I don't know how many viewers are going to tune into the dragon show because they saw Ricky
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:57.520]   the Dragon, Steamboat. Maybe they'll get a couple. I'm all excited now. I got to see this show.
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:04.240]   Los Angeles Natural History Museum. It's a museum. It's natural history. They're going to have a
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:11.600]   house of the dragon, the Targaryen Dynasty exhibit, displaying costumes and paraphernalia,
[01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:18.480]   as well as a giant dragon skeleton, which, as Vice is quick to point out, is a prop because
[01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:26.960]   dragons are not real, in case you were worried. But the weirdest one is HBO partnered with Duolingo.
[01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:34.720]   You can learn high valerian. They've updated their course in high valerian, 150 new words,
[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:42.080]   700 new sentences. I'm sure they had Klingon in the day, so this is just more of the same.
[01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:50.880]   There is a 3D billboard. Can I play this? This I feel like I could play this.
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:59.120]   This is a 3D billboard in Times Square. I love these 3D billboards because they cool Japan.
[01:28:59.120 --> 01:29:04.000]   They do these all the time. It looks like that dragon is really on that building. That's pretty
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:10.560]   believable. Is it going to breathe fire? The screams have gotten so good. Wow.
[01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:15.200]   They're so good. You set the whole building on fire. Yeah, blew it all off. Oh, and by the way,
[01:29:15.200 --> 01:29:24.240]   LG then says, "Watch it on our 97 inch TV." Are you going to have 97 inch TV into a house?
[01:29:24.240 --> 01:29:32.320]   You don't. You build the house around it. I'm not kidding. Many, many years ago,
[01:29:32.320 --> 01:29:41.520]   Sharp at CES showed 108 inch TV. I was still at the time doing live with Regis and Kelly.
[01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:45.840]   I said, "Guys, let's show this on live with Regis and Kelly." They were so excited about
[01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:51.120]   this opportunity to show off this. At the time, there was a battle who has the biggest screen at
[01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:56.560]   CES. You may remember this. Oh, yeah. It might be 15 years ago. It was a long time ago.
[01:29:56.560 --> 01:30:04.880]   The only way they can ship it is in the belly of a specially built 747. It arrives in this giant
[01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:11.920]   case with five technicians. They bring it onto the set. They open up the boxes the day before.
[01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:18.080]   They open up the box. They take it out. It's got a line down the middle of the screen.
[01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:26.560]   They're immediately on the phone to Tokyo talking. It's broken. There's something broke
[01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:35.360]   in transit. They said, "When you show the TV on live, we're going to have a lot of grass."
[01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:46.240]   Picture. No one will see the line. If you can't stand in the middle. I think that's still on
[01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:50.560]   YouTube. You could watch it. I don't think you'll see the line. The way they're going to start to
[01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:55.920]   do these is they're going to make them in multiple panels. We saw this in Korea. They showed this at
[01:30:55.920 --> 01:31:01.520]   CES too. I think this might be the biggest TV ever shown off at CES. Samsung did the wall TV.
[01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:07.600]   I loved the wall. I saw that in 2 inches. They were smaller panels. I want to say 50 inches.
[01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:12.800]   Yeah, it's micro LED. Then they put the panels next to each other and it looks seamless.
[01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:22.800]   So I think eventually someday that's what it'll be. It's also possible that it could be,
[01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:29.600]   and I know we've all seen this many times, that the OLEDs will be rollable. OLEDs bring them in and
[01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:36.880]   they'll just be rolled up like a poster. Then you'll spread that out 10-20 years from now when they're
[01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:44.480]   when they're not very expensive. We want to put up something larger than 65 inches or something
[01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:54.880]   on our walls. I think there are issues as I remember with the borders on these things.
[01:31:54.880 --> 01:32:01.600]   But I think that's the future. For me, that's going to be the future of for me. I'm not going
[01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:07.520]   to replace my big projector, my 100-inch projector until they have that big. Yes, here it is. Ladies
[01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:15.120]   and gentlemen, I found the video. By the way, they put me in a lab coat and everybody's on lab coat.
[01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:22.960]   Dr. Leo, don't look for the green line down the middle.
[01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:31.200]   It is great. This is an LCD. It is 1080p. There are only three in the world. This is the only one in
[01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:36.880]   the United States right there. Wow. I guess you can't see that line. It's so beautiful. Look at our gorgeous
[01:32:36.880 --> 01:32:41.920]   audience mugging for the camera. Am I going to get taken down by Regis and Kelly?
[01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:48.160]   Shark makes all sizes, but this is the biggest. 108 seconds. We're commenting. Yeah, we're commenting.
[01:32:48.160 --> 01:32:50.720]   This is derivative. It's not going to do anything to...
[01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:54.800]   The worst part is you have to take the roof off the house to get it in. There you go. You literally
[01:32:54.800 --> 01:33:01.120]   had to take the roof off the house to get that in. You have to build the house around it.
[01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:08.400]   But if you're a shaker, whoever, and you can afford a $150,000 TV, you can afford to take the roof off.
[01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:12.400]   Leo, can I ask you a question? Was that a fun gig? That looks incredible.
[01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:16.320]   Doing that? Oh, yes. Yeah, it was a great gig.
[01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:23.440]   Dick D. Bartolo, who, you know, Mads Manist writer, he's our giz, did it for years with Kathy Lee,
[01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:30.640]   Regis Kathy Lee. After 9/11, they couldn't get anybody to come to New York to do the show. They call
[01:33:30.640 --> 01:33:36.640]   me like the next months. And I said, "Well, yeah, I'll come out." And I remember because I went over
[01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:43.200]   to the 9/11 site. Yeah, it was very, very, very moving. They had chain link fences around, but,
[01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:49.280]   you know, posters, have you seen this person? I can't find him. Flowers. It was incredibly moving.
[01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:54.400]   It's now a beautiful memorial. They really made it with the gorgeous memorial. But I started,
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:34:00.720]   and then, so that was 2001. And I did it for, I think, 10 or 13 years. I did it until Regis retired.
[01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:05.120]   Wow. I didn't know that. That's awesome. And then Lance Ullenoff, you guys will know,
[01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:11.280]   former editor-in-chief PC Magazine, he took it over. I don't know who's doing it now. Although,
[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:19.120]   I'm lobbying. They had a guy who does sandwiches on TikTok, and I'm lobbying them to
[01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:25.040]   bring my son on who is the king of sandwiches on TikTok with 2.1 million followers. Because then,
[01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:29.760]   it would be like a dynasty. Yeah. Right? It's a dynasty. It's like father and son playing the
[01:34:29.760 --> 01:34:33.760]   same baseball team. Incredible. I don't think they'll make him wear a lab coat, though. That
[01:34:33.760 --> 01:34:42.800]   would be silly. Speaking of TV shows, here comes Ring, the video doorbell. MIT Technology Review
[01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:50.640]   headline says, "Ring's new TV show is a brilliant but ominous viral marketing ploy." You know,
[01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:55.520]   Ring, which is owned by Amazon, has been getting a lot of heat lately for letting police have access
[01:34:55.520 --> 01:35:01.520]   to videos and so forth. Turns out the other doorbell guys, Google, do the same thing. So,
[01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:09.760]   I'm not sure it's just a ring problem. But one way to improve your reputation is to do a TV show
[01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:15.040]   that's kind of like America's Funniest Home Videos. Only it's America's Funniest Home Doorbell
[01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:22.560]   Videos. There is a Ring Doorbell hashtag on TikTok with 2.5 billion views. The new show will be called
[01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:31.040]   the premiere next month. It'll be called Ring Nation. And it will feature, as you might imagine,
[01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:39.920]   videos from doorbells. Things like funny animals, marriage proposals, and heartwarming
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:46.080]   neighborhood interactions. This is from the press release. Wanda Sykes will host, and it comes from
[01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:57.920]   MGM Studios. Wait a minute. Who just bought MGM? Oh, Amazon! Shocker! So, you know what? It'll
[01:35:57.920 --> 01:36:06.560]   probably do fine. But I think it is a little bit about sanitizing. Oh, so cool. Before Amazon
[01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:12.480]   bottom ring was a sponsor. And they loved it. I started this, actually, because I would see all
[01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:17.200]   these on Twitter, I'd pull up a few doorbell videos as part of the ad. And they loved that.
[01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:22.960]   So I think I should take some credit. Anybody remember America's Funniest Home Videos?
[01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:29.520]   It was actually really pretty good. And so that makes me think that it'll be the same. It'll be the
[01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:35.200]   same. It'll be some decent material that they have to draw on. I see it on Reddit all the time,
[01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:40.720]   or Twitter. I always enjoy this. I think if I have any cameras and running 24, so there's got to be
[01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:48.160]   at least 20 minutes show worth of content a week. I agree. Yeah. For sure. And there's lots. The
[01:36:48.160 --> 01:36:54.000]   and this is the only problem with the show. I don't know if you know, but remember this,
[01:36:54.000 --> 01:37:00.560]   but the Ring Doorbell is very, it's a fisheye. So everything is fisheye. And it's a little,
[01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:07.040]   I don't know if I would want to watch a half hour fisheye videos, but they actually started this
[01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:11.200]   in 2018. And again, I want to totally take credit for this. They have a channel
[01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:20.160]   on TV.ring.com of Ring Videos. And so I think it was just natural
[01:37:20.160 --> 01:37:27.120]   that they would do a TV show. So watch for that coming soon to a TV near you.
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:30.240]   Was it Bob Saget that was Bob Saget?
[01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:35.040]   The lady should bring Bob Saget back to you. Who wants to tell Jason?
[01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:45.040]   Oh, is it is it not a Bob Bob hit his head on a sink and passed away? Oh, and now I feel terrible.
[01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:52.560]   Yeah, in the metaverse, we can bring Bob back. I think so. Yeah. He was a weird
[01:37:52.560 --> 01:38:00.000]   story back in March. He was on tour. And they discovered his body in the hotel room the next
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:06.880]   morning. And the Orange County Sheriff's Office said that he died of accidental blunt head trauma.
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:16.800]   And it was there was a bump in the front and the bump in the back. And it's I hate to say this,
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:20.800]   but it sounded almost comedic. Like he hit his head and then went sprung back and then really
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:26.480]   hit his head and then went to bed because he died in his bed. He thought, Oh, that hurt went to bed.
[01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:32.480]   And there was bleeding. Yeah. So speaking of avatar and metaverse, Leo, did you guys I missed it?
[01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:37.920]   Did you guys talk about the Vince Scully avatar at the field of dreams game? The other day? Oh,
[01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:43.280]   yeah, Google that real quick. Vince Scully, obviously the legendary Dodgers announced that he recently
[01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:48.320]   passed and Major League Baseball had a field of dreams game, which is a game between who was it?
[01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:53.520]   The Cubs and the Reds in this kind of like corn field from the movie. And I believe it was a
[01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:58.880]   seventh inning stretch. They had like a avatar thing of Vince Scully, like singing, take me
[01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:03.840]   out to the ballgame or something. I wonder if you I was wondering if you think it looks good or bad.
[01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:08.880]   I thought it looked kind of weird. Apparently caused a lot of
[01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:16.640]   Yes. discomfort. I was watching live. I was like, this doesn't look very convincing.
[01:39:16.640 --> 01:39:22.400]   Here's a here's a here's a nice here. I'll and you know, I loved it. Did you grow up in the LA area?
[01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:29.200]   Me? No, New York. Yeah. I loved Vince Scully, even though I was a Giants fan, he was the Dodgers
[01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:34.960]   play by play guy for 60 years. But there was nobody better. In fact, when he is great, it's weird
[01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:39.200]   because we were talking about him when we were talking about Apple baseball some weeks ago.
[01:39:39.200 --> 01:39:43.520]   The day he died, but he hadn't passed yet or we didn't know of it yet. We're talking about it.
[01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:47.920]   The very next day, we did a tribute to him. I played some old Vince Scully clips and stuff
[01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:53.280]   because there was nobody better. But this is this is from the field of they do this every year in
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:40:00.160]   Iowa in the cornfield, where field of dreams. It was kind of fun. Yeah. So he must have recorded
[01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:05.840]   this at some point. America. Yeah. But where's the avatar? So these are clips from the movie.
[01:40:05.840 --> 01:40:10.240]   Yeah, it was like in the seventh, the seventh inning stretch. It was in the
[01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:17.200]   stands or whatever. Like they did with the Fitti. Who was it that they did that at? Yes.
[01:40:18.080 --> 01:40:21.120]   Not fit. I don't know if it's the same tech or same company, but yeah.
[01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:29.280]   Let me see if I can find the so that's the wrong thing, I guess. I do kind of have a problem with
[01:40:29.280 --> 01:40:34.960]   using lightnesses of people after they're gone. Like I had the same reaction with the in
[01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:41.920]   the Star Wars movie where they brought Graham off Tarkin back, you know, and
[01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:49.440]   you know, use the use the avatar instead of just getting somebody else to play the person.
[01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:58.240]   Well, you have to. I'm sure Vince Scully's estate had to approve it. Well, maybe not though. I don't
[01:40:58.240 --> 01:41:03.600]   know. I don't know. Maybe his contract with the Dodgers said and I, you know, every time we do a
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:11.760]   contract, it says you're we own your image and perpetuity in all forms of media now or ever more
[01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:19.920]   invented throughout the universe. Seriously. I remember taking me the release would be that broad.
[01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:25.680]   So if you know, maybe that was part of the deal is that we can do anything we want with your.
[01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:32.560]   That they use those clauses to essentially say it's just where it gets
[01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:38.800]   concerning is where because then you can put anything into that person's, you know,
[01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:45.120]   yeah, right? And that's where that's where I think. Well, that's exactly the problem, isn't it?
[01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:50.320]   And yes, dead or alive. You don't have to you don't have to be dead to have words put in your
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:56.000]   mouth. Well, this is true. This is true. We see it all the time in the in the in this day and age of
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:00.400]   deep fakes. Deep fakes. It's just a matter of time, just a matter of time.
[01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:06.160]   Let me take a quick break. Lots more to talk about. Great panel today. So good to have all three of
[01:42:06.160 --> 01:42:12.080]   you. This episode of this week in tech brought to you by Oh, we love these guys. One of our longest

[01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:52.320]   many years of supporting this week in tech. All right, I think we can go back.
[01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:56.800]   Can I close that loop very quickly? The baseball hologram thing, it was Harry Carrey. I don't know
[01:43:56.800 --> 01:44:00.160]   why I said Vince. Oh, Harry Carrey. What are I going to find it?
[01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:08.080]   Yeah, no, that's no good. That's no good. I remember going to Wrigley Field and the seventh
[01:44:08.080 --> 01:44:12.640]   inning stretch. Harry leans. He's the broadcaster for the Chicago Cubs.
[01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:19.120]   Leans precariously out the window of the broadcast booth holding a beer. He's already
[01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:24.960]   sick of sheets to the wind and he goes, "Singer with me!" And he sings, "Take me out of the ball
[01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:31.920]   game." It was such a great tradition. Oh, that's kind of disappointing that they do the same thing with
[01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:38.160]   the... No beer this time. Yeah, he did the saying the song. Yes, I'm curious as to your opinion.
[01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:45.440]   Oh, God, I've actually, I saw it and I feel bad for people who never got to see it in real life. So maybe
[01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:55.520]   this is a chance to see something here. I'll play this. Error, geo restricted, video unavailable
[01:44:55.520 --> 01:45:01.680]   from your current location, the Twitch studios. That's where... I'm looking at it on YouTube right
[01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:08.640]   now. Yeah, you know what? I'm at sportsnet.ca. So that's why I'm in Canada. They don't want me
[01:45:08.640 --> 01:45:14.560]   to watch it. All right, YouTube. We've already done so many things that'll get us taken down.
[01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:24.640]   Might as well do one more. No, it's not your fault. I just... It's two YouTube's fault.
[01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:33.680]   These are all absolutely justifiable. It's just that YouTube, you know, is kind of just like Google
[01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:39.440]   automated and you don't really... I know Fox Sports is going to take me down for sure.
[01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:42.720]   We'll just edit this out. He was much drunker and older when I saw it.
[01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:48.160]   [laughter]
[01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:51.600]   No, I don't like that at all. I didn't play a clip. Yeah, just play a clip.
[01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:54.720]   I'm doing it. He did it so many times. There's no need.
[01:45:54.720 --> 01:45:57.760]   Just play a clip. He did it every game.
[01:45:57.760 --> 01:46:07.520]   Sometimes we use technology when it's like, why? It's the same thing with like when they did
[01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:14.000]   Princess Leia in that movie that I mentioned. Rogue One is the name of it, the Star Wars movie.
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:20.240]   And it was a really pretty good movie. And then there's two avatars that they used of, you know,
[01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:25.520]   as just like, why? Yeah. It looked like cartoons. Yeah.
[01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:30.080]   But what do you think when it gets so good that you can't tell it's an...
[01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:39.600]   Yeah. Then what? Yeah. I know. They used for that, they used her like leftover film of her
[01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:44.080]   from other movies. She'd already passed, Carrie Fisher. And I think they used, they like
[01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:52.400]   spliced in old clips to match the content. Yeah, that was in the third movie. This was the one
[01:46:52.400 --> 01:46:58.560]   where they actually just at the very end she shows up and it was an avatar with very bad,
[01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:01.200]   you know, it was badly done. But what if they did it perfectly?
[01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:09.520]   Yeah. I know. I'll jump in here because this popped up a few weeks ago. I believe it was Amazon.
[01:47:09.520 --> 01:47:14.480]   Correct me from wrong. They said they were going to use the assistant to bring back dead Velt.
[01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:21.440]   That was creepy as hell. Yes. My run passed. Yes. When I was 15 years old, she passed away from
[01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:26.160]   cancer. Not to bring the showdown. That's too serious. But like, that's true. That happened.
[01:47:27.200 --> 01:47:35.360]   I have zero interest in like some electrified version of hearing my mom say anything. Like,
[01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:42.000]   that's insane to me. I have a million photos. We actually have like old, whatever pre-VHS or
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:47.680]   whatever the camcorder, whatever the tape format was, videos of her. But like the idea that like,
[01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:55.040]   I'm going to let Amazon Alexa mimic my mother is like, and I tweeted to that to that extent.
[01:47:55.040 --> 01:47:59.120]   And I don't have to be people. People don't really know how to be able to know how to respond
[01:47:59.120 --> 01:48:03.600]   to that type of admission, frankly. But like, it's like, I don't want that. And if anyone might,
[01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:08.800]   it might be me. Again, I'm speaking for me. I can't speak for other people. But for someone who has
[01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:14.320]   like standing in this conversation, that doesn't really interest me. No, sir. No, thank you.
[01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:17.760]   Amazon announced this at that Remarze conference in Las Vegas.
[01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:25.280]   Rohit Prasada, senior vice president, had scientists for Alexa said, "While AI can't eliminate that
[01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:31.840]   pain of loss, it can definitely make their memories last." In a video, played at the event,
[01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:38.000]   an echo dot is asked, "A word, can you finish, can grandma finish reading me the Wizard of Oz?"
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:44.960]   Echo responds, "Okay." And then suddenly, it's the kid's grandma voice.
[01:48:46.320 --> 01:48:50.640]   We had to learn to produce a high quality voice with less than a minute of recording.
[01:48:50.640 --> 01:48:57.360]   We're only at the beginning of this. We have to do the effects.
[01:48:57.360 --> 01:49:03.200]   But I know you don't want it. But Nicholas, but maybe somebody would.
[01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:09.440]   I do respect that. I do get that. And I'm 100% fine with that. But my perspective is like,
[01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:15.520]   humans have souls. We're not just like a clump of cells that you can replicate
[01:49:15.520 --> 01:49:18.960]   with some dumb algorithm. And I don't like it. I don't like it.
[01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:26.400]   Remember the Black Mirror episode where her boyfriend has died?
[01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:34.480]   And there's a surface that brings him back. And of course, it's Black Mirror, so it ends in
[01:49:34.480 --> 01:49:41.840]   Tarrant. It's not good. I mean, this is something that's probably going to happen. It's not maybe
[01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:52.880]   not my lifetime. Maybe in US Nicholas. But people have created chatbots based on the text message
[01:49:52.880 --> 01:49:59.680]   history with the loved one. And it seems to be, for the people who've done it, it seems to be
[01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:06.800]   a form of mourning. I can't get inside their heads about why that is how they're processing
[01:50:06.800 --> 01:50:14.320]   the loss. But the technology is there. I wouldn't want to deny it to somebody who wants it, I guess.
[01:50:14.320 --> 01:50:21.120]   Yes, exactly. That's my perspective. If someone is into that, if they attach meaning to that,
[01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:25.120]   or if that is meaningful for whatever reason or a part of the process, that's awesome. That's
[01:50:25.120 --> 01:50:30.720]   great. I'm happy for you, frankly. But for me, I don't like it, I guess.
[01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:38.640]   And let's not forget that at least Microsoft and Meta haven't got the best track record with chat
[01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:46.000]   bots. Both of them, there was Tay, remember Microsoft's Tay, which was taking ideas from,
[01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:51.760]   I don't know, where Twitter or Reddit and eventually became racist, anti-Semitic and nasty. Same thing
[01:50:51.760 --> 01:50:58.080]   happened two weeks ago with Meta. They had a blender bot, an AI chat bot, supposedly giving
[01:50:58.080 --> 01:51:06.240]   Facebook users the opportunity to talk to Meta and share feedback. It also became
[01:51:06.240 --> 01:51:12.240]   basically anti-Semitic. It said, "Jews are overrepresented among America's super rich,
[01:51:12.240 --> 01:51:18.160]   and political conservatives are now outnumbered by liberal left-leaning Jews." It turned into Trump.
[01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:27.280]   Wow. And it also thought Trump was the president still. It had to be taught that no, in fact,
[01:51:28.080 --> 01:51:32.400]   Joe Biden is not a former vice president. He's the president of the United States.
[01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:39.680]   So I'm not sure that a chat bot or grandma is going to be really bad if grandma came back as an
[01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:46.240]   anti-Semite. I mean, really, let's, you know, wow.
[01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:54.080]   I do think we're just at the beginning of this. This is going to be a decade long debate.
[01:51:54.960 --> 01:52:01.280]   It's going to come up for sure. For sure. Because the technology is getting better and better to
[01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:07.840]   your point, you know, Leah, what happens when it is good enough. The part that I worry a little
[01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:17.520]   bit about is just taking somebody's likeness, companies profiting off of the likeness and the
[01:52:17.520 --> 01:52:26.960]   voice of someone and putting things, words and, you know, expressions and all of it into them
[01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:33.440]   and profiting off of them when those aren't, in fact, you know, their views necessarily, right?
[01:52:33.440 --> 01:52:38.720]   I mean, if you have a recording of grandma, wow, great. Do you have any
[01:52:38.720 --> 01:52:42.000]   Nicholas, any recordings of your mom, any videos or pictures?
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:46.400]   Yes, we have videos. We have whatever the camcorder was in like the 80s and 90s. We have,
[01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:49.120]   we have those. I have not been able to. So those are cherished, I'm sure, right?
[01:52:49.120 --> 01:52:56.000]   But that's different from like Amazon, like Algorithms spinning up her voice.
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:52:58.400]   I think I monetize my mother. Like what? Come on.
[01:52:58.400 --> 01:53:03.280]   No. And I have to say more and more. I mean, everybody now has hundreds of thousands of
[01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:09.920]   pictures of themselves and videos. You know, anybody who's anything after say 2005,
[01:53:09.920 --> 01:53:15.360]   it's well documented. So when I'm gone, there'll be hundreds of thousands of hours my kids can
[01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:22.960]   ignore. It'll be great. That's the future. I think we don't need deep fakes if you've got those
[01:53:22.960 --> 01:53:27.200]   as what I'm saying. This show may still go on. They will be with all the footage that you've
[01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:33.680]   given us there. There could be, you know, an avatar of Leo who's been twin. I honestly,
[01:53:33.680 --> 01:53:41.920]   I endorse that message. If I could find somebody who would create an avatar and an AI that could
[01:53:41.920 --> 01:53:46.560]   speak like me and say things that I might say, I don't even care if it becomes anti-Semitic.
[01:53:46.560 --> 01:53:53.280]   I don't care. I'll be dead. But I think that would be great. If we know we get to twit 2000
[01:53:53.280 --> 01:54:01.920]   and it's me still hosting it. That'd be great. I like that. I love that idea.
[01:54:01.920 --> 01:54:06.880]   Let's take a little break. We will talk lots more to talk. We haven't even gotten
[01:54:06.880 --> 01:54:10.720]   some of the biggest stories of the week. I can't believe it. It's too much fun talking to you guys.
[01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:16.480]   It's wonderful to have you. Owen Thomas from Protocol. He is senior editor there.
[01:54:16.480 --> 01:54:24.080]   Senior Electronics Reviewer for Consumers Union. The fabulous Consumer Reports. Nicholas De Leon.
[01:54:24.080 --> 01:54:32.560]   Great to have you. And of course editor in chief of ZDNet, Jason Heiner. Our show today
[01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:38.400]   brought to you by Noom. If you do have a Leo avatar, I hope you will use a more modern,
[01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:44.640]   little chubby in the old days. Maybe you don't want to bring that one back. In fact,
[01:54:44.640 --> 01:54:49.440]   you know, maybe wait a little bit. I'll get even thinner. Noom is my secret. I've been on every day.
[01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:53.280]   You know. Anybody's followed our shows. I'm always talking about the latest diet.
[01:54:53.280 --> 01:54:57.760]   Finally, I got tired of dieting. But more than a year ago, I told my wife, I said, Lisa, I want
[01:54:57.760 --> 01:55:03.360]   to do Noom. And because I'd seen the ads, as you probably have, and I thought, this might be a
[01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:10.640]   better idea. It's not a diet. It's about learning what triggers you to eat, why you eat, what you eat,
[01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:15.840]   and all of that. There are no bad foods. There's no restrictions. Noom is about learning
[01:55:15.840 --> 01:55:24.240]   so that you eat more healthily. And as a result, perhaps lose weight. So Lisa said, okay, a couple
[01:55:24.240 --> 01:55:29.600]   of days later, let me do it too. I only have a little bit to lose. Lisa is now on the lifetime
[01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:35.920]   maintenance plan. She lost all the way. She looks fantastic. I lost about 20 pounds.
[01:55:35.920 --> 01:55:41.680]   She didn't have much lose. I think she lost 10 pounds, but she's kept it off. It's amazing.
[01:55:41.680 --> 01:55:50.720]   Noom weight is a psychology first approach. It's designed to help you build more sustainable
[01:55:50.720 --> 01:55:56.000]   habits and behaviors with lasting results. And it's true. In fact, on the cruise, there was a
[01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:02.880]   guy in our chat, I won't name names because I don't want to embarrass him. But I love this guy.
[01:56:02.880 --> 01:56:06.480]   And I was really looking forward to seeing him on the cruise. And he wasn't there. I couldn't find
[01:56:06.480 --> 01:56:12.800]   him. I put on discord. I said, where are you? He said, I'm right here. I didn't recognize him
[01:56:12.800 --> 01:56:19.280]   because he'd lost 60 pounds since I saw him last. And I said, what did you do? He said, Noom.
[01:56:19.280 --> 01:56:24.960]   I said, they worked. He said, I loved it. He's kept it off. Neither of us gained weight on the
[01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:29.360]   cruise. Actually, Lisa lost a pound. I don't know how she did that. But that's saying a lot. You
[01:56:29.360 --> 01:56:33.840]   want a cruise where there's 18 meals a day and you don't gain weight. Noom. Because I learned
[01:56:33.840 --> 01:56:39.840]   why I eat, how I eat, I'm a fog eater. I don't even notice the food I'm putting in my mouth. So
[01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:46.080]   Noom helped me with their lessons to pay attention to every bite, to turn off the TV, put down the
[01:56:46.080 --> 01:56:53.680]   phone and focus and chew and eat. And my meals are more enjoyable. And I don't eat in a fog anymore.
[01:56:53.680 --> 01:56:59.200]   To date, Noom weight has helped more than 3.6 million people lose weight, including Lisa and me.
[01:56:59.200 --> 01:57:03.440]   Every journey is different. And that's neat. Lisa's lessons were different than mine. They're
[01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:08.800]   always personalized to you, your goals. It's based on scientific principles, well-known
[01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:16.000]   technologies like CBT, cognitive behavioral therapy, that help you understand your relationship
[01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:22.320]   with food. So there's no bad foods. There's no restrictions. Whatever your health goals are,
[01:57:22.320 --> 01:57:28.880]   it's a flexible, non-restrictive program that focuses on progress instead of perfection.
[01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:32.480]   And you get to do it the way you want to do it. Choose your level of support from five-minute
[01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:38.640]   daily check-ins, personal coaching. You get a group if you want to participate in. You get a coach,
[01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:46.480]   you get an app, a fantastic app on iOS and Android. Days off, fine. They even tell you,
[01:57:46.480 --> 01:57:51.280]   actually, sometimes they'll say, "You've done so well. Celebrate today. You know, have some fun.
[01:57:51.280 --> 01:57:58.160]   Eat a piece of cheesecake. It's okay." And no matter what happens, NUM always helps you get back on track.
[01:57:58.160 --> 01:58:04.960]   Active NUMRS lose an average of 15 pounds in 16 weeks. I lost more. 95% of customers say NUMW
[01:58:04.960 --> 01:58:11.840]   weight is a good long-term solution. Absolutely validates that. They've published more than 30
[01:58:11.840 --> 01:58:16.240]   peer-reviewed scientific articles to inform their users and practitioners and scientists
[01:58:16.240 --> 01:58:21.680]   about their methods, about their effectiveness. It really, really works as grounded in science.
[01:58:21.680 --> 01:58:28.880]   And I could just, I could tell you, it works. I've met so many people now. And we've told so many people,
[01:58:28.880 --> 01:58:37.920]   we've shown so many people about NUM and with great results. I'm kind of a NUM ambassador these
[01:58:37.920 --> 01:58:44.400]   days. As Lisa really is, she loves it. Say what's focused on what's important to you with NUMW weight
[01:58:44.400 --> 01:58:50.320]   psychology-based approach. I got my trainer to do it. My massage therapist, sign up for your trial
[01:58:50.320 --> 01:58:59.120]   today. NUMW.com/twit. N-O-O-M.com/twit. I hope I can get you interested. At least go check, do the trial.
[01:58:59.120 --> 01:59:05.200]   When you first sign up, there's an onboarding thing. There's a lot of questions. Do that because
[01:59:05.200 --> 01:59:12.720]   it really is tailoring the program to exactly what you need. That's really important. N-O-O-M
[01:59:12.720 --> 01:59:20.240]   NUMW.com/twit. Thank you, NUMW. Seriously, thank you for everything you've done for us.
[01:59:20.240 --> 01:59:27.680]   Before we get back real quickly, a fabulous week on Twitch, we made a little movie to celebrate
[01:59:27.680 --> 01:59:34.720]   watch. John Deere, someone finally managed to hack into their operating system. These bastards
[01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:40.400]   that control the food production and the tractors for everybody in the world have been stealing
[01:59:40.400 --> 01:59:47.680]   Linux. An ancient, obsolete, unpached, buggy version of our stuff. They don't even have a GPL
[01:59:47.680 --> 01:59:55.360]   policy. I didn't get that out of my own system. Previously on Twitch, hands-on photography. Today,
[01:59:55.360 --> 02:00:01.040]   I'm in the lab because I want to talk about product photography. Today's episode, I'm just going to
[02:00:01.040 --> 02:00:06.480]   work with a particular product that you can do it with anything. It just needs to be some type of
[02:00:06.480 --> 02:00:13.200]   product of a brand that you recognize and just go from there. This week in Enterprise Tech.
[02:00:13.200 --> 02:00:18.400]   You're sitting in front of a Mac keyboard. Listen up. Nautical on dark reading has
[02:00:18.400 --> 02:00:23.520]   detailed and expanded and enhanced malware campaign called Operation Intercept.
[02:00:23.520 --> 02:00:30.560]   It's aimed at Macs running on the M1 chip. It's courtesy of our old friends, North Korea's own
[02:00:30.560 --> 02:00:37.920]   Lazarus Group. This week in Google, Amazon and Nielsen. This is interesting. Have made a deal to
[02:00:37.920 --> 02:00:45.040]   get ratings for Thursday night football. Nielsen will primarily measure Amazon viewers on TV sets.
[02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:52.560]   The very fact that they use the phrase TV sets. Sounds like the 50s. Could you touch those great
[02:00:52.560 --> 02:00:58.640]   Amazon rabbit ears we got on that TV? Twit. You hate to have a V8 chip.
[02:00:58.640 --> 02:01:06.800]   We had a lot of fun. Of course, Club Twit members add to the fun. We're going to have a
[02:01:06.800 --> 02:01:11.680]   great book club on Thursday. If you're not a member of Club Twit, here's the pitch. Real quick,
[02:01:11.680 --> 02:01:17.200]   seven bucks a month. You get ad-free versions of all the shows. You get access to the really fun
[02:01:17.200 --> 02:01:21.120]   Club Twit discord where there are always good conversations. Not just about the shows, but about
[02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:26.480]   everything. Geeks are into. You also get the Twit Plus feed and you get some special stuff that
[02:01:26.480 --> 02:01:32.640]   we don't put out in public. Hands on Windows, Paul Thorot's new show, Hands on Macintosh,
[02:01:32.640 --> 02:01:37.200]   Micah Sargent's new show, The Ultimate Linux, or sorry, The Untitled Linux Show, although it
[02:01:37.200 --> 02:01:43.600]   should be the Ultimate Linux Show. The Gizfiz. As I mentioned on Thursday, our book club Clara and
[02:01:43.600 --> 02:01:49.920]   the Sun, Ant, Stacey, and I will talk about a wonderful book. You still have time to read it.
[02:01:49.920 --> 02:01:56.880]   You can read it pretty quickly or listen on Audible. All of that, it's like a country club
[02:01:56.880 --> 02:02:04.800]   for Twit listeners. Twit.tv/club twitches seven bucks a month. We thank all of our Club Twit members
[02:02:04.800 --> 02:02:11.600]   because they really are helping us out in what we anticipate to be next year, maybe even harder
[02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:18.960]   than the COVID years. It's lean out there because, well, there's a lot of reasons I'm going to blame
[02:02:18.960 --> 02:02:26.080]   Spotify. You guys are great. So thank you for the support. Seven bucks a month. Twit.tv/club
[02:02:26.080 --> 02:02:31.840]   Twit. I bought this. I'm so sad I bought it. I was shortly after I got it. Snap canceled it.
[02:02:31.840 --> 02:02:40.160]   The Flying Selfie Pixie Drone. I should have brought it. I have it at home. It's the idea is it
[02:02:40.160 --> 02:02:44.560]   lands in your hand. You throw it in the air. It takes a selfie of you, puts it on snap.
[02:02:44.560 --> 02:02:53.040]   I updated it in a crash and I never was able to get it working again. So, but four months after
[02:02:53.040 --> 02:02:59.760]   its launch, Snap says, yeah, never mind the Pixie Drone. 230 bucks I wasted.
[02:02:59.760 --> 02:03:11.600]   Ouch. Do you remember Lily Robotics? No. I think it was a drone startup with pretty much the same
[02:03:11.600 --> 02:03:19.200]   idea. They filed for bankruptcy in 2017. I believe all this is the one that would follow you around?
[02:03:19.920 --> 02:03:29.440]   Yes. Probably ahead of its time. Yeah, because they got in trouble with the, I believe with
[02:03:29.440 --> 02:03:35.520]   local officials in San Francisco where they were based basically saying that they kind of
[02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:41.120]   deceived people with their crowd funding. They were raided by the SFPD.
[02:03:43.840 --> 02:03:52.160]   Took 60,000 orders worth more than $34 million for their drone. Do they never ship a drone?
[02:03:52.160 --> 02:03:58.320]   I don't believe they did. I mean, obviously drone technology is a lot better now. This is
[02:03:58.320 --> 02:04:04.080]   five years on from their failure. But, yeah, in fact, my drone will follow me now,
[02:04:04.080 --> 02:04:07.360]   which is good because if I were steering it, it would plow right into a tree.
[02:04:09.120 --> 02:04:17.680]   I remember covering one in 2016 in China, I saw it was called Hover Camera. There's an article on
[02:04:17.680 --> 02:04:24.960]   actually it's on ZDNet, I think, or tech republic. It's called Hover Camera. They eventually made
[02:04:24.960 --> 02:04:33.120]   it to CES. Oh, yeah, it is on ZDNet. I saw it at GMIC Beijing, which is kind of like their version
[02:04:33.120 --> 02:04:42.000]   of CES. It was really interesting at the time. It was one of the first ones that I saw that
[02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:47.520]   actually worked where you could hold it in your hand. You hit the app on your phone, it takes off,
[02:04:47.520 --> 02:04:55.200]   and then it can follow you around and take a good camera. I think you used gestures to tell it.
[02:04:55.200 --> 02:05:01.520]   Oh, this looks very similar. Same idea as the PIX, as the snap one.
[02:05:01.520 --> 02:05:07.760]   Yeah. Yeah. Well, can you still get it? The hover?
[02:05:07.760 --> 02:05:10.560]   I don't know, but I think they did actually ship it.
[02:05:10.560 --> 02:05:14.160]   Yeah, it was available in Apple stores for $500.
[02:05:14.160 --> 02:05:18.320]   Yeah. This one.
[02:05:18.320 --> 02:05:24.320]   Zero, Zero Robotics was the company that did it. They were in stealth mode until just before that.
[02:05:25.280 --> 02:05:30.000]   Yeah. A previous version of this article stated customers could fly the hover camera
[02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:34.800]   passport in stores with the assistance of the Apple Genius. We have corrected it to reflect the
[02:05:34.800 --> 02:05:39.520]   fact that you can't, the employee. Oh, that one's a little diff.
[02:05:39.520 --> 02:05:43.120]   Is that different? This is when you apply in the Apple stores.
[02:05:43.120 --> 02:05:50.160]   Okay. Oh, no, that one. So that one is the right one. This one was a year after my original
[02:05:50.160 --> 02:05:54.880]   story. But it's the same. That is the same one. But they had a video to,
[02:05:54.880 --> 02:05:59.200]   looks like it's still live on YouTube, but I don't know whatever happened to them.
[02:05:59.200 --> 02:06:00.880]   Yeah. They sort of lost touch.
[02:06:00.880 --> 02:06:03.360]   If you're not DJI, it's going to be a tough...
[02:06:03.360 --> 02:06:06.080]   It's going to be tough. Yeah. For sure.
[02:06:06.080 --> 02:06:12.560]   Speaking of DJI, Chinese company, US is planning, in fact, this article is from a protocol
[02:06:12.560 --> 02:06:20.000]   to block sales of older chip making tech to China. China has been trying to catch up desperately
[02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:26.880]   with Taiwan, with TSMC, with American chip makers, especially because TSMC now has gotten down to the
[02:06:26.880 --> 02:06:34.000]   three nanometer process, quote, so quote, three nanometer process. But they do it with the technology
[02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:42.560]   that the US government will not allow China to have EU, the extreme ultraviolet lithography.
[02:06:47.280 --> 02:06:54.160]   EUV tools are manufactured by a Dutch firm, but the US was able to convince the Netherlands to block
[02:06:54.160 --> 02:07:00.160]   the company from selling equipment to China because one of the sub-modules is made in California.
[02:07:00.160 --> 02:07:03.920]   And without that, they can't build the EUV machines.
[02:07:03.920 --> 02:07:10.640]   What do you think of this, Owen? This is your store... Not your Max Churney wrote it, but from protocol.
[02:07:10.640 --> 02:07:13.920]   Is this fair play?
[02:07:15.600 --> 02:07:22.320]   I think so. And it's really interesting that rather than play with the nanometers,
[02:07:22.320 --> 02:07:28.800]   which have become really just marketing hype in the chip world, they're looking at specific
[02:07:28.800 --> 02:07:38.800]   technologies and looking where they can kind of trip China up in this race to ever improving chip
[02:07:38.800 --> 02:07:46.640]   technology. It's certainly fair play in that China has made no secret that it wants to
[02:07:46.640 --> 02:07:53.440]   fight a kind of war of technological and scientific advancement with the West.
[02:07:53.440 --> 02:08:02.080]   If they're thinking about that as a means of war, then this is a psychological response.
[02:08:02.080 --> 02:08:06.640]   I'd make the argument in the opposite, though. And of course, it's a very tricky game to play,
[02:08:07.920 --> 02:08:11.760]   especially with China was very adept at manipulating soft power tools,
[02:08:11.760 --> 02:08:17.760]   sending money to Africa and other countries in their rodent belt initiative.
[02:08:17.760 --> 02:08:24.480]   I feel like the thing that keeps the piece best is if we're all in bed together.
[02:08:24.480 --> 02:08:31.440]   If economically China's dependent on us, they're not going to declare war on us.
[02:08:33.920 --> 02:08:39.040]   So I feel like there should be a way to work with China to support China's growth,
[02:08:39.040 --> 02:08:42.720]   maybe they're hostile, in which case, I guess we have to be sort of hostile back.
[02:08:42.720 --> 02:08:47.200]   But I also think it's so important for us to be
[02:08:47.200 --> 02:08:53.920]   in relationship with them that that's how you have peace. Yes?
[02:08:53.920 --> 02:08:56.320]   For sure. And we really are.
[02:08:56.320 --> 02:09:00.000]   Go first, Jason, and then we'll go back to you, Owen. Sorry.
[02:09:01.520 --> 02:09:03.760]   Owen can finish, and then I'll go. Okay, Owen.
[02:09:03.760 --> 02:09:08.960]   And I think the key thing here is this is a very nuanced...
[02:09:08.960 --> 02:09:10.880]   I'd agree with you on that.
[02:09:10.880 --> 02:09:11.360]   Yes.
[02:09:11.360 --> 02:09:16.880]   Policy really gets into the weeds of technologies like VINFAT and EUV.
[02:09:16.880 --> 02:09:21.520]   I think you want to avoid, though, xenophobia and say, "Oh, they're Chinese. They're dangerous."
[02:09:21.520 --> 02:09:24.320]   And I see that with TikTok and stuff.
[02:09:24.320 --> 02:09:30.000]   Yeah. And that's why compared to, say, the Trump administration's approach to TikTok,
[02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:32.800]   this is just incredibly nuanced and specific.
[02:09:32.800 --> 02:09:40.960]   And it feels like there's a strategy and a goal that is more than just beat up China.
[02:09:40.960 --> 02:09:48.400]   Like the US administration is thinking, "What do we want to accomplish here?"
[02:09:48.400 --> 02:09:48.880]   Right.
[02:09:48.880 --> 02:09:50.240]   That's interesting.
[02:09:50.240 --> 02:09:55.600]   Yeah, I don't want to verge to the red scare mentality of the '50s,
[02:09:55.600 --> 02:09:59.200]   but at the same time, I understand this is a very subtle diplomatic game.
[02:09:59.200 --> 02:10:00.720]   And sometimes you have to exert pressure.
[02:10:00.720 --> 02:10:04.080]   Maybe that's how the Biden administration is exerting pressure.
[02:10:04.080 --> 02:10:09.680]   I don't think the tariffs that the Trump administration used were a very good or effective tool.
[02:10:09.680 --> 02:10:12.800]   They heard us more than they were China, frankly.
[02:10:12.800 --> 02:10:15.920]   But I also think it's so important.
[02:10:15.920 --> 02:10:19.200]   I don't want to get in a situation where we're at odds.
[02:10:19.200 --> 02:10:21.360]   We're sort of are, right?
[02:10:21.360 --> 02:10:25.200]   But let's maybe tamp it down a little bit.
[02:10:27.760 --> 02:10:31.280]   For instance, I don't know if we'd had stronger economic ties with Russia.
[02:10:31.280 --> 02:10:35.840]   Would they have been so apt to invade Ukraine?
[02:10:35.840 --> 02:10:40.640]   And if we did, then our sanctions would have been more effective, etc., etc.
[02:10:40.640 --> 02:10:41.840]   I don't know.
[02:10:41.840 --> 02:10:43.200]   I'm not an expert on this kind of thing.
[02:10:43.200 --> 02:10:49.120]   I worry that if we get too knee-jerk in our response, everybody is at risk.
[02:10:49.120 --> 02:10:50.800]   Everybody loses.
[02:10:50.800 --> 02:10:51.040]   Yeah.
[02:10:51.040 --> 02:10:56.560]   And the US economy is so interdependent with China and vice versa.
[02:10:56.560 --> 02:11:09.280]   And the moves to separate or to wall off is not going to be helpful or useful.
[02:11:09.280 --> 02:11:12.560]   Now, there is still competition between the two.
[02:11:12.560 --> 02:11:14.080]   There likely will be.
[02:11:14.080 --> 02:11:16.400]   It's the number one and two economies in the world.
[02:11:17.920 --> 02:11:26.000]   There's going to be competition for tech and for just innovation in general as part of this.
[02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:33.920]   But you're going to see things like, I think, keeping technology out of the hands of the Chinese,
[02:11:33.920 --> 02:11:40.320]   unless it has some kind of, you're worried about them doing something that is,
[02:11:42.000 --> 02:11:47.600]   yeah, is going to be used destructively against someone else.
[02:11:47.600 --> 02:11:52.480]   Doesn't necessarily seem like the best idea.
[02:11:52.480 --> 02:11:59.360]   Now, at the same time, you have China saying recently that all of this American, like the US
[02:11:59.360 --> 02:12:04.400]   chips act was anti-competitive for global competition.
[02:12:04.400 --> 02:12:04.800]   It was.
[02:12:04.800 --> 02:12:04.800]   Right.
[02:12:04.800 --> 02:12:06.080]   That's it.
[02:12:06.080 --> 02:12:07.520]   What's the point of it?
[02:12:07.520 --> 02:12:11.680]   We'll give money to our American and the Taiwanese chip manufacturers.
[02:12:11.680 --> 02:12:16.640]   As long as they don't deal with any business with China, it was expressly that.
[02:12:16.640 --> 02:12:27.360]   But it won ultimately what that chip's act was in its core was a response to what China
[02:12:27.360 --> 02:12:33.680]   and Taiwan and South Korea have already been doing with their chip manufacturers
[02:12:33.680 --> 02:12:39.840]   for years, for decades, and that the US has fallen behind because they haven't made this
[02:12:39.840 --> 02:12:47.120]   a friendly environment for companies to operate those kind of chip making facilities here.
[02:12:47.120 --> 02:12:49.040]   They're behind.
[02:12:49.040 --> 02:12:56.000]   It's going to take five years at least for the US to catch up even with the chips act.
[02:12:56.000 --> 02:13:01.920]   Some of these things are, all of that is just to say that some of these things are
[02:13:01.920 --> 02:13:08.000]   stuff that happens that you try to win the war of rhetoric.
[02:13:08.000 --> 02:13:10.000]   When in fact, it's just really good.
[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:15.440]   There's a lot of really intense competition for things that are going to shape the future
[02:13:15.440 --> 02:13:17.680]   of the economy, the future of innovation.
[02:13:17.680 --> 02:13:23.600]   And so it's not a bad thing that these companies have, are sort of elbow in each other to move
[02:13:23.600 --> 02:13:26.080]   forward and compete with each other.
[02:13:26.080 --> 02:13:30.160]   We just need to make sure our elbows aren't too sharp in this.
[02:13:30.160 --> 02:13:31.040]   Well put.
[02:13:31.040 --> 02:13:31.520]   Well put.
[02:13:31.520 --> 02:13:33.280]   It is a delicate tightrope.
[02:13:33.280 --> 02:13:36.400]   It's well above my pay grade.
[02:13:36.400 --> 02:13:43.040]   But I feel like what we don't want is for the two economies to become decoupled.
[02:13:43.040 --> 02:13:47.600]   That's very dangerous at some point.
[02:13:47.600 --> 02:13:51.920]   I think we're almost done here.
[02:13:51.920 --> 02:13:55.600]   Except for this, the tool that monitors how long kids are in the bathroom
[02:13:55.600 --> 02:13:58.640]   is now in 1000 American schools.
[02:13:58.640 --> 02:14:00.160]   Oh great.
[02:14:00.160 --> 02:14:06.160]   We've seen this in the workplace where employers are closely monitoring
[02:14:06.160 --> 02:14:09.360]   their employees, break time, bathroom time, and so forth.
[02:14:09.360 --> 02:14:13.200]   And now they're doing it in schools with something called e-haul pass.
[02:14:13.200 --> 02:14:18.080]   A digital system that students have to use to request to leave their classroom,
[02:14:18.080 --> 02:14:19.920]   which notes how long they've been away.
[02:14:19.920 --> 02:14:24.720]   It's being used widely in the 1000 schools in the United States.
[02:14:24.720 --> 02:14:28.960]   Very much like the tool used to monitor Amazon employees.
[02:14:28.960 --> 02:14:35.280]   Oh I don't know if I like this idea or not.
[02:14:36.160 --> 02:14:38.400]   I don't like it.
[02:14:38.400 --> 02:14:39.040]   I know that.
[02:14:39.040 --> 02:14:40.000]   Yeah.
[02:14:40.000 --> 02:14:41.680]   I definitely don't like this.
[02:14:41.680 --> 02:14:42.640]   I can't imagine.
[02:14:42.640 --> 02:14:44.800]   We really need to do that.
[02:14:44.800 --> 02:14:46.640]   It's just police.
[02:14:46.640 --> 02:14:48.240]   You know it's just over policing.
[02:14:48.240 --> 02:14:49.360]   It is over policing.
[02:14:49.360 --> 02:14:49.840]   Yeah.
[02:14:49.840 --> 02:14:52.320]   You know like why does a kid ask good at the bathroom?
[02:14:52.320 --> 02:14:54.000]   Sometimes they need to go to the bathroom.
[02:14:54.000 --> 02:14:57.600]   Sometimes they just need to be by themselves for a second.
[02:14:57.600 --> 02:15:03.040]   You know what sometimes if they want to go to smoke a cigarette, let them go.
[02:15:04.640 --> 02:15:05.040]   You know?
[02:15:05.040 --> 02:15:06.640]   Yeah.
[02:15:06.640 --> 02:15:08.000]   We don't have to judge it.
[02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:09.280]   I need some bathroom time.
[02:15:09.280 --> 02:15:09.760]   Do you mind?
[02:15:09.760 --> 02:15:14.320]   The tool promises quote "haul omniscience"
[02:15:14.320 --> 02:15:20.160]   with the ability to always know who has a pass and who doesn't without asking the student.
[02:15:20.160 --> 02:15:22.320]   Hey, papers please.
[02:15:22.320 --> 02:15:32.320]   It is also designed, the website says specifically to block vandalism and TikTok challenges.
[02:15:33.200 --> 02:15:35.120]   All right.
[02:15:35.120 --> 02:15:36.160]   Maybe I'm out of touch.
[02:15:36.160 --> 02:15:37.680]   I get those two things are together.
[02:15:37.680 --> 02:15:39.920]   Maybe I'm out of touch.
[02:15:39.920 --> 02:15:46.080]   But maybe there is a problem now with kids going off and twerking in the hallways.
[02:15:46.080 --> 02:15:46.560]   I don't know.
[02:15:46.560 --> 02:15:48.880]   Maybe doing the dance.
[02:15:48.880 --> 02:15:49.360]   I don't know.
[02:15:49.360 --> 02:15:54.400]   I'll go into some smart kidches hacks that and just like disables it.
[02:15:54.400 --> 02:15:57.200]   That just feels like one of those who asked this.
[02:15:57.200 --> 02:15:57.680]   There you go.
[02:15:57.680 --> 02:16:00.560]   Our teachers asking first don't they have like a million one other things to worry about.
[02:16:00.560 --> 02:16:01.200]   There you go.
[02:16:01.200 --> 02:16:02.640]   Omniscience in the hallway.
[02:16:02.640 --> 02:16:04.080]   Yeah, we don't need a hallway.
[02:16:04.080 --> 02:16:04.640]   I'm not sure.
[02:16:04.640 --> 02:16:06.400]   No, I don't think we do.
[02:16:06.400 --> 02:16:09.920]   Also like they're already managing for outcomes, right?
[02:16:09.920 --> 02:16:12.160]   Like they have standardized testing.
[02:16:12.160 --> 02:16:13.440]   Kids get grades.
[02:16:13.440 --> 02:16:13.840]   Yeah.
[02:16:13.840 --> 02:16:17.200]   You know, if they're if they're going to the bathroom a little longer because they need
[02:16:17.200 --> 02:16:20.240]   a break like Owen was saying, sometimes they just need a break.
[02:16:20.240 --> 02:16:20.640]   Right.
[02:16:20.640 --> 02:16:21.440]   When they're crying.
[02:16:21.440 --> 02:16:25.600]   And they're and they're grades are and they're doing okay on their grades.
[02:16:25.600 --> 02:16:27.680]   Like it's fine, right?
[02:16:27.680 --> 02:16:31.360]   And if they're if they're not doing on their okay on their grades, then you know,
[02:16:31.360 --> 02:16:37.680]   because there's not spent enough time in the classroom or whatever, then there's probably bigger
[02:16:37.680 --> 02:16:40.240]   things to to to work on.
[02:16:40.240 --> 02:16:43.120]   Well, I know one bigger thing I want to work on.
[02:16:43.120 --> 02:16:45.440]   The House of Dragons, I want to let you guys go.
[02:16:45.440 --> 02:16:52.720]   So you can either watch or not watch and make a statement by your lack of attendance.
[02:16:52.720 --> 02:16:55.840]   Thank you so much, Jason Heiner for being here.
[02:16:55.840 --> 02:16:57.280]   Good job on the news.
[02:16:57.280 --> 02:16:58.000]   ZD net.
[02:16:58.000 --> 02:16:59.600]   I think it really looks great.
[02:16:59.600 --> 02:17:02.640]   I told to Mary Jo Foley, your employee.
[02:17:02.640 --> 02:17:04.720]   Not much.
[02:17:04.720 --> 02:17:05.360]   I liked it.
[02:17:05.360 --> 02:17:06.560]   She's shocked.
[02:17:06.560 --> 02:17:10.080]   You know, when I went to her article on Wednesday, I guess you launched it on Wednesday.
[02:17:10.080 --> 02:17:13.840]   Went to her article on Wednesday and went, whoa, this is a news unit.
[02:17:13.840 --> 02:17:17.440]   But I immediately liked it better because it's just cleaner.
[02:17:17.440 --> 02:17:18.880]   It's easy to find stuff.
[02:17:18.880 --> 02:17:20.160]   The stuff you want is there.
[02:17:20.160 --> 02:17:20.720]   Well done.
[02:17:20.720 --> 02:17:22.080]   Thank you.
[02:17:22.080 --> 02:17:24.480]   Lots of thought lots of people that worked on it.
[02:17:25.040 --> 02:17:32.160]   But really, it embraces our mission for 2022 and beyond, which is helping people deal with
[02:17:32.160 --> 02:17:38.560]   disruptive innovation, understand it, understand how they can sort of have a piece of it now for
[02:17:38.560 --> 02:17:43.680]   the things because our audience has always been professionals, early adopters, enthusiasts.
[02:17:43.680 --> 02:17:49.520]   And so we wanted to make a site that really reflected that and that serves that audience
[02:17:49.520 --> 02:17:50.160]   really well.
[02:17:50.720 --> 02:18:00.480]   And so we've simplified a lot of things and really optimized for what we believe is a very
[02:18:00.480 --> 02:18:04.960]   exciting, very momentous sort of next five to 10 years in tech.
[02:18:04.960 --> 02:18:06.720]   And that's what we're preparing for.
[02:18:06.720 --> 02:18:07.040]   Good.
[02:18:07.040 --> 02:18:12.320]   I, you know, I am a fan having worked for more than a decade for Ziff Davis,
[02:18:12.320 --> 02:18:17.040]   back with the original parent company, back in the tech TV days and before.
[02:18:17.920 --> 02:18:22.800]   Be I know so many people, including you working at Ziff, really very talented,
[02:18:22.800 --> 02:18:24.320]   good writers, great people.
[02:18:24.320 --> 02:18:25.440]   I wanted to succeed.
[02:18:25.440 --> 02:18:26.080]   We need it.
[02:18:26.080 --> 02:18:27.760]   So I'm glad you're doing well.
[02:18:27.760 --> 02:18:29.200]   It's great to see you again, Jason.
[02:18:29.200 --> 02:18:30.080]   Thank you for joining us.
[02:18:30.080 --> 02:18:30.560]   Thanks, Leo.
[02:18:30.560 --> 02:18:31.520]   Likewise.
[02:18:31.520 --> 02:18:34.640]   Mr. Owen Thomas, always a pleasure to see you.
[02:18:34.640 --> 02:18:38.160]   What tell me something exciting and new about protocol?
[02:18:38.160 --> 02:18:39.280]   What's going on over there?
[02:18:39.280 --> 02:18:41.680]   I like it.
[02:18:41.680 --> 02:18:43.200]   It's it's it's free.
[02:18:43.200 --> 02:18:45.360]   I really like that.
[02:18:45.360 --> 02:18:45.360]   Yeah.
[02:18:45.360 --> 02:18:47.440]   We're we we we don't pay.
[02:18:47.440 --> 02:18:53.280]   Still haven't dabbled in the in the paywall universe, though, you know, never never say never.
[02:18:53.280 --> 02:19:00.720]   We are just a rock and roll and, you know, doing coverage from Washington to Wall Street to
[02:19:00.720 --> 02:19:08.560]   Silicon Valley, especially at that nexus of of policy and technology where where things get like
[02:19:08.560 --> 02:19:09.840]   little wonky and weird.
[02:19:09.840 --> 02:19:13.280]   I think the chip story is a good example of what we do where we can, you know,
[02:19:13.280 --> 02:19:18.240]   we can deep dive into the details of the technology and then like zoom out and tell you big picture
[02:19:18.240 --> 02:19:19.040]   why it matters.
[02:19:19.040 --> 02:19:22.960]   Yeah, I loved if we didn't get to it, but I loved your article about wallets and why everybody's
[02:19:22.960 --> 02:19:23.920]   doing a wallet now.
[02:19:23.920 --> 02:19:29.520]   And it's that kind of understanding that's so important and so useful to people cover this space.
[02:19:29.520 --> 02:19:32.160]   I visit protocol every single day.
[02:19:32.160 --> 02:19:34.720]   So thank you for the good work you're doing.
[02:19:34.720 --> 02:19:41.920]   And my friend from consumers union, of course, you know, I love consumers report consumer reports.
[02:19:42.800 --> 02:19:43.920]   Nicholas de Leon.
[02:19:43.920 --> 02:19:46.720]   What are you working on right now?
[02:19:46.720 --> 02:19:52.480]   I am working on it should be published in the week or two.
[02:19:52.480 --> 02:19:55.280]   We did a big thing on gaming chairs earlier this year.
[02:19:55.280 --> 02:19:56.080]   Yeah, remember that.
[02:19:56.080 --> 02:19:56.720]   Yeah.
[02:19:56.720 --> 02:19:58.720]   Yes, yes, that is wrapping up.
[02:19:58.720 --> 02:20:03.200]   We bought basically we bought every single gaming chair of note and ran them through the
[02:20:03.200 --> 02:20:06.320]   ringer because they're very popular kids like I share one right now.
[02:20:06.320 --> 02:20:06.720]   Sure.
[02:20:06.720 --> 02:20:11.440]   And kind of give you tips in which ones to buy, which ones to avoid.
[02:20:11.440 --> 02:20:16.640]   I don't really want to say too much on the year right now, but it is a very thorough
[02:20:16.640 --> 02:20:22.160]   investigation into these gaming chairs, which again, there kids love them.
[02:20:22.160 --> 02:20:24.320]   You cannot use YouTube without seeing these things.
[02:20:24.320 --> 02:20:26.400]   So that's that's what I've been working on.
[02:20:26.400 --> 02:20:27.600]   I don't know for the past couple of weeks.
[02:20:27.600 --> 02:20:28.720]   That's about time.
[02:20:28.720 --> 02:20:33.120]   Somebody blew the lid off the gaming chair consortium.
[02:20:33.120 --> 02:20:36.000]   Well, you see so many roundups on other sites.
[02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:40.400]   I'm not going to mention names, but like did they even do they buy these chairs with
[02:20:40.400 --> 02:20:41.440]   money? Probably not.
[02:20:41.440 --> 02:20:42.880]   They even get review units in.
[02:20:42.880 --> 02:20:47.280]   I kind of doubt that it just aggregated like, regurgitated marketing copy.
[02:20:47.280 --> 02:20:48.400]   And it's like, okay, that's fine.
[02:20:48.400 --> 02:20:52.720]   I guess, but like we bought them and used them when we have like PhDs on staff,
[02:20:52.720 --> 02:20:58.400]   like analyze these things for performance and their economic bonafine.
[02:20:58.400 --> 02:21:02.960]   And they're, I don't want to say they're they're they're they're not great.
[02:21:02.960 --> 02:21:05.680]   I guess I can say, which is probably not surprising.
[02:21:05.680 --> 02:21:06.160]   Yeah.
[02:21:06.160 --> 02:21:10.400]   Most of them are not awesome. I guess I'll leave it at that.
[02:21:10.400 --> 02:21:15.280]   But it is interesting to see the brands, which ones do better than others,
[02:21:15.280 --> 02:21:19.280]   and which ones are just like just not not good, I guess.
[02:21:19.280 --> 02:21:20.720]   I again, I don't want to say too much.
[02:21:20.720 --> 02:21:21.360]   I'll probably get in trouble.
[02:21:21.360 --> 02:21:22.160]   Well, I'll be reading it.
[02:21:22.160 --> 02:21:24.880]   That is coming up in a week or two.
[02:21:24.880 --> 02:21:28.960]   Plus a great article on the new tax credits for plug-in.
[02:21:28.960 --> 02:21:30.160]   Yes, I was going to mention that.
[02:21:30.160 --> 02:21:32.480]   That's really confusing.
[02:21:32.480 --> 02:21:38.080]   And so thank you for doing the hard work to figure out which ones qualify and which ones
[02:21:38.080 --> 02:21:41.200]   don't. Of course, I've been a member forever.
[02:21:41.200 --> 02:21:43.680]   Consumerreports.org, the consumers union.
[02:21:43.680 --> 02:21:44.480]   You guys do great work.
[02:21:44.480 --> 02:21:45.840]   And it's always a pleasure to have you on.
[02:21:45.840 --> 02:21:46.560]   Thank you, Nicholas.
[02:21:46.560 --> 02:21:47.840]   Thank you, Leo.
[02:21:47.840 --> 02:21:48.880]   Thanks to all three of you.
[02:21:48.880 --> 02:21:51.200]   It's a great, great show.
[02:21:51.200 --> 02:21:53.680]   We do Twitter Sunday afternoons.
[02:21:53.680 --> 02:21:59.040]   It's kind of the last word in tech in the first podcast of the week.
[02:21:59.040 --> 02:22:01.280]   We'd like to do it Sunday so you can have it on Monday.
[02:22:01.280 --> 02:22:03.280]   I used to say for your Monday morning commute.
[02:22:03.280 --> 02:22:07.920]   But even if your commute is just from the bedroom to the office, that's fine.
[02:22:07.920 --> 02:22:10.640]   We do it at 2 p.m.
[02:22:10.640 --> 02:22:14.480]   Pacific 5 p.m. Eastern 2100 UTC of a Sunday evening.
[02:22:14.480 --> 02:22:19.120]   If you, I mentioned that because you can watch us do it live live.tuit.tv.
[02:22:19.120 --> 02:22:21.440]   Live audio and video streams there.
[02:22:21.440 --> 02:22:23.280]   If you are watching live chat with us live.

[02:22:26.240 --> 02:22:29.920]   There's instructions there for using an IRC client or you can just use your web browser
[02:22:29.920 --> 02:22:31.120]   to participate in the chat.
[02:22:31.120 --> 02:22:34.720]   And of course our club twit members are in their discord chat as well.
[02:22:34.720 --> 02:22:38.000]   After the fact on demand versions of the show are available at the website.
[02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:41.920]   There is also a YouTube channel, youtube.com/thisweekintech.
[02:22:41.920 --> 02:22:47.520]   And there is of course an RSS feed because we're a podcast.
[02:22:47.520 --> 02:22:50.800]   So you could subscribe in your favorite podcast client.
[02:22:50.800 --> 02:22:52.480]   And that way you get it automatically.
[02:22:52.480 --> 02:22:54.560]   So it'll be there for you Monday morning.
[02:22:54.560 --> 02:22:56.560]   However far your commute.

[02:22:59.440 --> 02:23:01.200]   We'll see you next time another twit.
[02:23:01.840 --> 02:23:02.640]   Bye bye.
