[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.200]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech,
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.200]   the show we cover the week's Tech News

[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.200]   Ian Thompson is in studio with us.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.200]   It's so great to see you, U.S. editor of the register.com now
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.200]   and a longtime stalwart in the show.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.200]   Always fun to pull up.

[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.200]   I think we've got to get back into the office these,
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.200]   back into--
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.200]   Yeah, except--
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.200]   Everybody's getting sick all of a sudden.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.200]   So I'm not sure you're right on that.
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.200]   Well, flew colds, but, you know--
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.200]   Yeah.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.200]   I'm nervous, man.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.200]   I'm scared.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.200]   Also with us from beautiful downtown--
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.200]   No, beautiful Lower East Side, Providence, Rhode Island.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.200]   Mr. Alex Wilhelm.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.200]   Fully shaved.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.200]   Hey, everybody.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.200]   You just-- nothing.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.200]   There's no hair.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.200]   No hair at all.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.200]   It took a while.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.200]   It hurt.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.200]   I bled a little bit.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.200]   You look good.
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.200]   You actually look good.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.200]   Thank you.
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.200]   I tried very hard for you, Leo.
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.200]   I knew you were going to show up wearing something silly,
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.200]   and I'm like, "You know what?
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.200]   We'll go serious."
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.200]   You look like a baby.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.200]   Like--
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.200]   [laughter]
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.200]   It's like a very old baby.
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.200]   Since a baby in your household is imminent,
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.200]   I thought you were just doing it in tribute.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.200]   No, this is my usual email.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.200]   Actually, Define Jason Howl asked if I could come on next week's
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.200]   Twitter, and I said, "Well, that's our due date, so probably not."
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.200]   Yeah, no.
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.200]   And he was like, "Well, how about the week before?"
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.200]   And I'm like, "Yeah."
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.200]   But I have already given you permission.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.200]   I want everyone to know if the call should come,
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.200]   then you must leave, and you don't even have to say goodbye.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.200]   You just get the hell out, you know?
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.200]   Well, that's fine, but then if I get bored and just want to leave
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.200]   and I just bounce, people will expect me to arrive tomorrow
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.200]   and I'm warning with the child.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.200]   Just say, "Hey, I'm the baby."
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.200]   That's all.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.200]   The one piece of advice my dad gave me if I ever had kids was
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.200]   when it comes time to go and welcome the new version in,
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.200]   bring sandwiches, because everyone's going to be hungry.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.200]   Takes a while and everybody's going to be hungry.
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.200]   That's Connie Gulyamo.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.200]   Good to see you, Connie Editor-in-Chief of CNET,
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.200]   the only person who has any right to speak about having babies in this panel.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.200]   I might submit.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.200]   All right.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.200]   Great to--
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.200]   Two kids, yes.
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.200]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.200]   My wife and every woman I know who's had a child gets mad
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.200]   when guys talk about the expanse of birth,
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.200]   because we're bystanders.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.200]   Absolutely.
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.200]   It's like breakfast.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.200]   You have an important role to play, sandwiches,
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.200]   sandwiches that's begs to be it.
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.200]   I brought-- I brought-- I read somewhere.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.200]   This is so stupid.
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.200]   I'm such a stupid new father.
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.200]   I remember that Mizzo Soup was a good choice.
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.200]   So I brought a thermos--
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.200]   Oh, I mean, I'm in a foreign country.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.200]   And Jennifer, like, said, get that--
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.200]   It's making me nauseous.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.200]   Get that out of here.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.200]   Wasn't a good idea.
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.200]   I also remember this how long ago it was, 30 years ago.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.200]   I remember writing a hypercard stack to time the contractions.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.200]   And I realized later that was just my way of dealing with the anxiety.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.200]   It was like, please tell me you didn't tell--
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.200]   Jennifer, I told Jennifer, and she knew she was married to a nerd.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.200]   And I said, well, if it hurts, just tell me, you know,
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.200]   I made it so we press a space bar.
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.200]   And it says--
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.200]   I'm amacious to the life.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.200]   We didn't.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.200]   Yeah, we didn't get very far with that progress, with that project.
[00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.200]   I got about four or five contractions in, and that was it.
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.200]   It was all right.
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.200]   All right, let us talk about the stuff that matters.
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.200]   The news is funny.
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.200]   It's funny on Wednesday, Paul Therott and I were talking on Windows Weekly,
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.200]   and we kind of came to the conclusion, well, there's a slight risk.
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:53.200]   You know, with Lena Kahn in there at FCC, there's a slight risk they could hinder
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.200]   the acquisition, the $70 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:00.200]   The very next day, the FCC sues.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.200]   They have decided to block it.
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.200]   Any thoughts on that, Connie, is--
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.200]   You know, the Microsoft's contention is this does--
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.200]   this makes us the number three gaming company.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.200]   Come on.
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.200]   Come on, we're not dominant.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:19.200]   Well, you know, whenever it comes to Microsoft and monopolies in any market,
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.200]   there's a little bit of history there that can speak from their office.
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:27.200]   That said, the FCC does face a little bit of an upward challenge,
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:32.200]   because this is what's called a vertical merger, where they don't directly compete 100%.
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.200]   Yes, Microsoft has Xbox.
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.200]   You made the point they'll be number three in the market, but arguably that's not
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.200]   Microsoft's largest business, even with the acquisition.
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.200]   But, you know, people are very skeptical of big tech these days, as we all know.
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.200]   There's a lot of power in these large companies, and anything that gets a large
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.200]   company even larger is going to raise questions and suspicions.
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.200]   So we'll see how this plays out.
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:01.200]   Like I said, from a legal perspective, there's a vertical merger is not the same as a different,
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.200]   you know, a monopoly making merger.
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:09.200]   But nonetheless, it's the air, the era of distrust and big tech.
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:13.200]   Microsoft did a little tour, a tour of contrition.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:18.200]   Can you have contrition before the act where they went to Sony and said the fact
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:23.200]   they even said, we rich Turner said, we heard a richer Spencer, uh, Phillips Spencer.
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.200]   I'm sorry.
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:25.200]   What's his name?
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.200]   Yeah.
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.200]   Phillips Spencer said, who was the head of Xbox said, we would give them a forever
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.200]   contract, but we can't.
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:34.200]   So we're going to give Sony 10 year guarantee that Call of Duty will remain on
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.200]   PlayStation 5.
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.200]   They went to Nintendo to the same thing.
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.200]   I think they went, did they go to Steam and do, I think they did.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.200]   They went to Steam and did the same thing.
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:48.200]   So they reassured everybody hoping that this would forestall the FCC's action.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:53.200]   Like, and certainly this was one of Sony's biggest concerns is, well, if Microsoft
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.200]   owns Call of Duty, they're not going to allow it on our PlayStation.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.200]   And I think that's silly.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.200]   Of course they are.
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.200]   Does it make money?
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.200]   Yes.
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.200]   Oh good.
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.200]   You can sell it.
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.200]   Alex, is that a big concern?
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:09.200]   I mean, certainly exclusives make a big difference in console gaming.
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.200]   I just don't feel like it.
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.200]   Console gaming is Microsoft's biggest business.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.200]   That's, that's where I wanted to go with this.
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:22.200]   I think we're right about the FTC and the kind of legal world that we live in, but my
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.200]   question is, why do they really want it?
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:29.200]   And also, if we can't stop this style of acquisition, what can we stop?
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:30.200]   Yeah.
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:37.200]   Well, and, and Lena Kahn, who is the chair of the FCC, was also a very, when she was a
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.200]   professor, where's it Columbia?
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:43.200]   She was a very strong advocate of antitrust action.
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.200]   In fact, yeah.
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:48.200]   I mean, she wrote, I mean, she wrote thesis on Amazon and by the way, a Brit as well.
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.200]   So thumbs up.
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:53.200]   But yeah, I mean, she's, she's got the tech industry running scared at the moment.
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.200]   Because that means they're really gunning for this.
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.200]   And it's about time.
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.200]   We need some competition in the market.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.200]   But, but what, why, why do they need it?
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:06.200]   Like Microsoft may become the number three gaming company with this, but keep in mind
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:11.200]   that between Xbox and PC, they at least support an enormous fraction of the gaming market.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.200]   And they already make all the money in the world.
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:17.200]   Like what can someone really walk me through the positives of this deal for Microsoft?
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:19.200]   Because it seemed to me that a lot of trouble over nothing.
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.200]   If they're not even going to get the exclusives out of it, what's the real reason?
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.200]   What's the real draw?
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.200]   It's a lot of money, isn't it?
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.200]   $69 billion.
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:31.200]   It's the largest consumer tech acquisition in two years.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.200]   It's like one and a half e-lombs.
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.200]   Yeah.
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.200]   It's the biggest that Microsoft's ever done.
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.200]   It was bigger than their acquisition of LinkedIn.
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:42.200]   That's a lot of money to spend.
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:47.200]   I have to say that Microsoft has been a good steward of gaming, they bought Minecraft,
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.200]   and have made it bigger and better than ever.
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.200]   Right?
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:55.200]   Okay, I don't play it, but I mean, have they developed it much?
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.200]   Oh, yeah, quite a bit.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.200]   Okay, right.
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.200]   They put a lot into it.
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:07.200]   So you were saying that Connie, this doesn't end with the FTC, they now have to go to court.
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.200]   That's right.
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.200]   That's right.
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.200]   And look, I, to your question about why do they want it?
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.200]   Where else are they going to put their money?
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.200]   They're an enterprise cloud maker.
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.200]   They have a business audience.
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:23.200]   That's where they make the bulk of their money and they have failed business,
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:28.200]   dismally at almost every consumer play they've ever made in the marketplace.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:32.200]   We've gone through two years of a pandemic where people in lockdown, guess what?
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:37.200]   Want to play a lot of games and fortunately or hopefully we're getting out of that
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:44.200]   pandemic mindset, you know, current caseloads aside, but, you know, Microsoft is looking at the long game in the future.
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:48.200]   They need to win over a larger audience, younger audience, diversify their revenue.
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.200]   It's the same story, blah, de-blah, de-blah, de-blah.
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:53.200]   I want to go look at anything else.
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:58.200]   Gaming has had a lot of potential just recently, although now it's a little bit sluggish.
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:03.200]   I know we might talk about esports in that whole world, but, you know, what, what are they going to do?
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.200]   Go buy a social media network.
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:10.200]   I mean, they're looking at opportunities and places that have affinities with things that they're working on.
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.200]   So it's, you know, at the end of the day, a business decision, but go ahead.
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.200]   Go ahead, Alex.
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:20.200]   If they have, they have so much money, they're going to drop 70B on one gaming company.
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:24.200]   Why not do the world a favor and bring back Windows Phone with that $70 billion?
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.200]   Oh, wouldn't that be facetious?
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.200]   Is that a favor?
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:29.200]   That would be a favor.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.200]   It would be a favor.
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:31.200]   I agree with you.
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.200]   I was talking about it.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:40.200]   I was saying, I was seeing some chatter about it this week, but it was just like, Windows Phone was such a dire operating system.
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:41.200]   No, it was a, okay, wait a minute.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.200]   Hold on!
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.200]   Oh, no!
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.200]   There was a great operating system.
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.200]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.200]   It's failed.
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:51.200]   It's a mobile operating system and then do an upgrade and say, right, everything else is, is now junk.
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.200]   We're not going to support it.
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.200]   This was dumb.
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.200]   It's not about Windows.
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.200]   Windows Phone was in 7.5, mango update or whatever the hell it was.
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.200]   We'll live in infamy.
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.200]   My titles were smart.
[00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:02.200]   I'm really tired of that.
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.200]   My lives were smart.
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.200]   Yeah.
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.200]   And we need competition.
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.200]   This is right now the biggest problem going on right now.
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.200]   Hang on, Alex, did you just say zoom?
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.200]   Yes, I owned a zoom.
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.200]   Oh my God.
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.200]   I've heard about these.
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.200]   I've read about these.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.200]   I've been friends for so long, but I'm not sure I can explain.
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.200]   Was it the Alex?
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.200]   Was it a brown zoom?
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:25.200]   I had the black zoom code blue trim and I will tell you this.
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:32.200]   When I was working on a farm, the zoom could get me through a 12 or 13 hour shift driving harvesters on one charge.
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.200]   And at the time, my iPod couldn't do that.
[00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:36.200]   And so the zoom saved my bacon when I really needed it.
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.200]   I had to say this is the last zoom.
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:41.200]   The zoom HD was actually really, really good.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.200]   They finally got it right at the end.
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.200]   But this was the same problem with windows.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.200]   All solid-state, not.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.200]   You know, the Nokia phones were absolutely fantastic.
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.200]   Amazing.
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.200]   What operating system?
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.200]   Running windows phone.
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.200]   Thank you.
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:57.200]   But then they bought Nokia, destroyed the company, gave up on it.
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:13:01.200]   And if they're going to come back in again, it's got to be good.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.200]   I don't think they're going to come.
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:05.200]   I don't think there's a chance in hell to come and back to phones.
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.200]   But I would say this.
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.200]   First of all, they probably, unfortunately, would use Android.
[00:13:09.200 --> 00:13:13.200]   Because the real problem with windows phone was they couldn't get the developers to support
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.200]   it and the phone companies to support it.
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:19.200]   If you don't put it in the store on the front desk, as somebody's walking in, nobody's
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.200]   going to ever buy it.
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.200]   It was the same with the palm pre.
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:22.200]   Yeah.
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.200]   And so they didn't get the support they needed to make it a success.
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:29.200]   And if Microsoft does a phone, in fact, they do one.
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:32.200]   I mean, they don't like to call it that, but the duo is a phone and it's running Android.
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:33.200]   Which is disappointing.
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.200]   So let's talk about it.
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.200]   Go ahead, Connie.
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.200]   What is Microsoft buying?
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.200]   They're trying to buy audience.
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.200]   They're trying to buy a customer base.
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.200]   They're trying to buy developers, right?
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.200]   And that's what Activision potentially gives them, right?
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.200]   It doesn't give them a great corporate culture at Activision.
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:52.200]   That all needs to be cleaned up, obviously.
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:57.200]   But they're trying to buy growth in audiences and in communities and developers.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.200]   Is it the smart move?
[00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.200]   I'm not going to say it's the smart move.
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.200]   They have a lot of money.
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:06.480]   Remember, once upon a time, they wanted to buy Yahoo for $49 billion and I forget what year
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.480]   that was.
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:11.800]   And that would have been an incredible acquisition 15 years or 20 years ago, whenever that was.
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:16.560]   But you know, you have companies that are looking at paths ahead.
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:20.240]   And I'm not going to say that they're always making decisions in the best interest of what
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.720]   is the best technology.
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:22.720]   What's great?
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:23.840]   What do we want to bring to the marketplace?
[00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:24.840]   So, okay, okay.
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:25.840]   I love that.
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:26.840]   I love that.
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:27.840]   They bought GitHub did very well with it.
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:28.840]   Yeah, they've been actually there.
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:29.840]   They're out there.
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:30.840]   Yep.
[00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:31.840]   Yeah.
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.880]   Because in fact, are they good stewards at LinkedIn?
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:35.320]   That was their biggest acquisition.
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.640]   LinkedIn is not really developer focused on us.
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:38.800]   More of a more of a social.
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:42.560]   But that was doing what Connie was just talking about, which is buying community, right?
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:43.560]   True.
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:48.000]   But what if instead of buying Activision, what if instead they bought Unity, which is public
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.720]   and very cheap right now because they're talking about this falling off the cliff and
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:54.720]   then they get the unity engine, which powers most of the mobile gaming world, created an
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:58.680]   avenue back to get developers on board on a mobile since from Microsoft, bringing us
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.840]   back to Windows Phone.
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.720]   Wait, I'm following that.
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.920]   That is a long and a winding road, mate.
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:08.760]   I'll take your word for this.
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:13.080]   I just think that what we're seeing right now, this duopoly of Android and Apple, especially
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:16.160]   in the stores, the app stores, is not good.
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.000]   And Apple's facing a lot of heat because of that.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.440]   Google's facing a lot of heat in the US from LinaCon in the EU.
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:30.520]   It would be the heat is off if Microsoft by creates a competitive phone platform.
[00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:33.000]   I guess that's probably a non-starter.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.600]   I think from a software perspective, it's incredibly difficult because you know, it's
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:37.600]   too late.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:41.600]   I mean, for developers to either go on, yeah, I mean, you either go mass market for Android
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:46.600]   and get very little money or you go niche for Apple and get a bit more money, but trying
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:51.560]   to create a third software ecosystem in the mobile phone sphere is going to be, you've
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:54.800]   got to have something absolutely killer to get people to change.
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:16:01.960]   In a way, I could change the story, Microsoft has shown a lot of discipline, discipline
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:06.480]   that other companies lack gave up on phone quickly when it realized it was looking up
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.720]   short, lived the kin was.
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:13.600]   As soon as it realized the product wasn't going anywhere, it gave up, it gave up on
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:14.960]   Cortana.
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:20.640]   And now Amazon and Google are stuck with a very expensive voice assistance that they
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:25.640]   have all incredibly hard time to monetize, clearly Microsoft realized that early on.
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:29.120]   Maybe they're showing good corporate discipline, but you raise an interesting question, Connie,
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:36.600]   about culture because yes, Activision Blizzard has a horrific culture with harassment, but
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.280]   so does Microsoft.
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:45.840]   Microsoft last week, there was a report released about Microsoft's lack of attention to complaints
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:51.040]   from female executives about advances from Bill Gates and others.
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:55.360]   They've had a similarly bad corporate culture.
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:17:03.120]   So I mean, this, maybe not quite as bad as Activision was horrible.
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:06.640]   But yeah, this is a problem at tech companies in general, right?
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:07.640]   I guess so.
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:08.640]   The lack of advancement of women.
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:11.920]   So I guess they're smart enough to put widgets together, but they can't figure out how to
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:15.080]   promote half of the gender in the world.
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:18.680]   So that's another conversation for another day.
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:19.680]   Well, maybe not another day.
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:20.680]   Well, no, no, no.
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:26.880]   I didn't worry about this earlier in the month because after 47 years, Microsoft finally
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.280]   released its first sexual harassment report.
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.280]   47.
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.560]   They were forced to do it.
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:32.560]   Yeah.
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:36.840]   I mean, I spoke to Katie Missouri about this and she was just like, well, I took nearly half
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:37.840]   a century.
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:45.040]   And one of the things that came out was that there were many cases where they just had
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:50.200]   just ignored the complaints of, and particularly with the highest level executives, did not
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.680]   come out well for Bill Gates.
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:52.680]   Nah.
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:54.320]   Well, I mean, he's kind of knew that.
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:55.320]   He has a record.
[00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:59.080]   I mean, this goes across pretty much every Silicon Valley firm as far as I can see it.
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.360]   Well, that's the interesting question.
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:04.480]   Yeah, it's just, it's just how it is in Silicon Valley.
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.640]   And it shouldn't be.
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:08.000]   Should do something about it, I guess.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   It's changing.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.120]   And it's changing slowly, but it's changing way too slowly.
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:14.000]   That's not going to come into any considerate.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.160]   But of course, not going to consider that FTC is not considering that, right?
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:22.680]   I mean, it's just considering the market and the amount of share that market would get.
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:23.680]   Yeah.
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:28.400]   I'm still not, I'm still not sold on the deal, but I do think that Lina Khan flexing her muscles
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.720]   here is indicative of what we expected from her when she got the job.
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:36.000]   See, I feel like it's almost performative that politics these days is so performative.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.360]   It's like not really necessarily there's a problem here, but I've got to say something
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:43.400]   because, you know, I've got to show the flag.
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.840]   No, no, Leo, come on.
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:47.960]   If she didn't try to stop this, what's her point?
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.840]   And so if she did try to stop it, she's doing what she said she was going to do.
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.160]   I think you're going one level, two cynical on this.
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:56.440]   I think we have a reform minded person in the chair.
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:58.640]   There's a big deal with a big company coming through.
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.200]   It'll make an even bigger company.
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:03.720]   And frankly, put aside the fact that it's Microsoft, that it's Activision Blizzard, that
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:04.920]   it's big tech.
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.520]   Microsoft is one of the biggest companies in the world, period.
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:12.480]   And it wants to buy an enormous company that may change the competitive landscape.
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:15.960]   This is where we should have the government come in and be like, actually $2 trillion
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.640]   in market gap is sufficient.
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:22.720]   Like, come on, if we can't stop this, then what deal would not trip the red lines of
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:24.120]   corporate agglomeration?
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.640]   This is the blog.
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:26.640]   Okay.
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:32.000]   And I'm laughing at your comment, Leo, that politics these days is performative.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   These days, like what?
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   Dude, wake up.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   All of a sudden people are.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   Alex is right.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.760]   He came in on a platform to look at big tech.
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.840]   That's literally what she came in and said.
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:49.240]   And we talked about her background and said, it's like, oh, should anybody be surprised?
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:50.240]   I'm sorry.
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:53.480]   And they know big tech has gotten big.
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:58.520]   And the influence that it has over our lives, if you were uncertain about it before, certainly
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:03.080]   living through the pandemic has convinced you that these companies have a lot of power,
[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:05.880]   have a lot of influence, have a lot of sway in your life.
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:10.640]   And it's all well and good until something happens that annoys you or inconveniences
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:14.280]   you or you realize, wait a minute, that's not fair.
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:15.280]   Right?
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:19.920]   And so, I mean, we can talk about what's happening with Twitter and the fate of democracy.
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:22.720]   But Microsoft is a very, very large company.
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:27.960]   They want to get bigger because their whole rationale is not the betterment of humanity.
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.720]   It's the betterment of profit.
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:32.960]   And they're looking for audience and people and opportunity.
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:33.960]   And why don't they buy unity?
[00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.840]   Because they're also looking for scale.
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:36.840]   How fast can we do it?
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:37.840]   Ouch, ouch, ouch, brutal.
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:42.000]   I used to talk to the Unity, a CFO after earnings, and then they stopped asking when there's
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   stock price followed by like--
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.200]   It's unreal engine all the way, right?
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.200]   It's just done.
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.200]   That's why.
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:51.360]   Except for Apple, because Unreal Engine doesn't run on Apple because of Epic Apple.
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.360]   But--
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:55.720]   Yeah, well, Unity powers a big chunk of the mobile gaming world.
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:57.520]   I was joking about it earlier about that.
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:58.520]   Okay, mobile.
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:01.000]   And that's why I tried to connect it to Windows Phone earlier as a joke.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   But like--
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.920]   Oh, I finally got it.
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.920]   Thank you for explaining that joke.
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:08.600]   Sorry, I thought I had a more sophisticated audience.
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:09.800]   There is an issue.
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:10.800]   Meow.
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:11.800]   Ooh, this is awesome.
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:12.800]   Oh, I just get--
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:13.800]   Kissy hat.
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:16.360]   All right, is there-- oh, that hurts right here.
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:17.600]   Here's the problem.
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:18.920]   You guys are all in California.
[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:20.000]   My state that I love.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.480]   It's 2.30 in the afternoon there.
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.760]   It's dinner time here.
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:24.560]   And I'm going to get hungrier and hungrier--
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:25.560]   Get some food.
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:26.560]   Get a snicker.
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.720]   I'm out in the shed, Leo.
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:29.720]   There's a wind--
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:30.960]   There's no store between me and the house.
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:35.120]   Second wife is rather large right now.
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:38.440]   And she would not bring me food because she's my spouse, not my servant.
[00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:40.120]   So I'm just going to be hungry for a--
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:41.840]   Oh, I'm a modern man.
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:42.840]   That's very impressive.
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:43.840]   I'm right.
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:45.200]   I aspire to be.
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.200]   I mean--
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:47.200]   Good for you.
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.200]   Yeah.
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.480]   Politics is a little performative.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:51.480]   Yes.
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:55.920]   And I do worry a little bit about performative actions against big tech.
[00:21:55.920 --> 00:22:01.000]   Okay, maybe you should say, you know, Activision, Microsoft, that's not a good idea.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.440]   But look at all the state governments now banning TikTok.
[00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:05.440]   Oh, it's--
[00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:07.640]   That's performative, isn't it?
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:08.640]   Yeah.
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:09.640]   It's useless.
[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:10.640]   It really is.
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:12.640]   Tennessee now, South Dakota.
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:13.640]   South Dakota, Christie now.
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:15.440]   A huge problem in South Dakota.
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:16.440]   Maryland.
[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:18.200]   Rural poverty, no broadband, the rest of it.
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:20.000]   But no, that's Bantake Hill.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.680]   And they aren't banning it for citizens.
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:24.160]   They're just banning it for state government because that's all they can do.
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.600]   But that-- I mean, it's pure performative.
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:27.720]   But-- or maybe not.
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:28.720]   You know what?
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:33.600]   Probably the app shouldn't be on the phones of service members in the Pentagon.
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:39.200]   It should be on the phone of, you know, people with high profile jobs and security issues.
[00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.200]   Okay, that's fine.
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:44.440]   Well, I mean, we've seen this before with things like fitness trackers, which expose
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:45.640]   to US bases.
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:46.640]   We've had--
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:47.640]   Yes.
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:48.640]   Strava, yeah.
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:49.640]   Yeah.
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:54.360]   We've had, you know, apparently the US government claims that they managed to send a hell-fired
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:58.080]   drone after an alcada senior level up because somebody put a--
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.080]   Okay.
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:00.480]   --put a geo-tagged picture on social media.
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.680]   If you're an alcada, don't use TikTok.
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:04.760]   It's not a good idea not to use TikTok.
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:05.880]   So there are people who shouldn't use it.
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:08.640]   But for regular citizens, how much of a threat is it?
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:11.960]   There is a commissioner of the FCC who says it should be banned.
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:14.360]   Well, he's-- he's doctor performative.
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:15.360]   I know.
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.360]   You talk the FCC.
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:17.360]   But Mark Warner--
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.360]   That's his name.
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:19.360]   --and his name is Michael, right?
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:21.600]   Yeah, Senator Mark Warner also says it should be banned.
[00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.400]   I mean, does that fool me?
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:28.320]   That's why I worry-- this is why I worry about coming down on Big Tech as a general
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:34.720]   principle because it's-- we've gotten a lot of benefits from Big Tech.
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:35.720]   We survived--
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:43.400]   But Lee, are you ignoring why people are mentioning this and why we want to not-- might
[00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:49.880]   not want TikTok on the mobile phones of government contractors or people in a position of power
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.000]   that affects our nuclear arsenal?
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.320]   It's because the Chinese government can be collecting data on the back end.
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:58.160]   We don't know what we don't know.
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:01.760]   How does that affect you and me and our everyday life?
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:02.760]   I don't know.
[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:03.760]   Probably--
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:06.400]   Do you think TikTok is a hazard to you or your kids?
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:07.400]   I don't know.
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.400]   I don't know.
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.400]   Well, I can tell you--
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:12.400]   --but you're betting most of my life every day.
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:13.400]   --lives them ice.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:17.040]   There's some American companies that are a hazard to you and your kids.
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.040]   Facebook, Fox News--
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:19.040]   I mean, it's all--
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.040]   It's all stale.
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.040]   --just because Chinese doesn't mean--
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:22.040]   It's like a hazard.
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:23.040]   It's like a hazard.
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:27.640]   OK, out of interest, over the panelists here, who has TikTok on their personal phones?
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:28.640]   Oh, no.
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:29.640]   Yeah, I do.
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:30.640]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:31.640]   I take it off of us.
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:32.640]   OK.
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:33.640]   I'm the only one.
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:34.640]   Yeah.
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:35.640]   The Chinese--
[00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:36.640]   I'm not going to--
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:37.640]   --mystles are going to hit me.
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:39.640]   No, I mean, I have it on a burner phone, but I won't have it on my personal phone.
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:40.640]   Wow, you guys are paranoid.
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:43.040]   Hey, only the pound will survive.
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:49.040]   No, I think, instead, Leo, we're just aware of how information policy works with Chinese
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.040]   companies.
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.040]   No, I understand.
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:52.960]   And this is a regulation in reverse.
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:53.960]   I understand.
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:54.960]   You see, how about--
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.600]   But what are they going to do with that information?
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:58.600]   Whatever they want.
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:24:59.600]   What?
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:00.600]   But what do they got?
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:01.600]   They know where I am.
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:02.600]   Maybe-- no, I have to turn off location services.
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:03.600]   What do they know?
[00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:05.960]   They don't know-- diddly.
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:10.280]   This phone is not-- this app is not giving up much.
[00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:13.560]   And there are far worse apps you guys are using already.
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:17.520]   By the way, does this reassure you, TikTok has announced that Oracle will now be storing
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:19.000]   all U.S. citizens' data?
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.360]   Are you happy about that?
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:21.360]   No.
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.360]   No.
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:23.360]   Yes, I trust Larry.
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:24.360]   Oracle.
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:25.360]   So--
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:26.360]   Well, why didn't it though?
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:27.360]   It's American.
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:30.040]   We disChina for this.
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:35.040]   But let's say under the Patriot Act, American companies are just as liable to hand over
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:37.960]   data to the government as Chinese companies are.
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:39.880]   So let's not be hypocritical about this.
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.440]   All hail the glorious leader.
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:46.680]   But I mean, it's one of those things that if you're dealing with a national software,
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:49.400]   then you have to accept.
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:52.360]   But I'm not happy about sending that data to China.
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:53.360]   OK.
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:55.760]   I'm worried that it might be more xenophobia.
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:26:00.040]   It might be anti-Chinese sentiment as opposed to actual legitimate fear.
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:05.960]   Well, don't conflate criticism of a totalitarian government with dislike of the people it
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:06.960]   oppresses.
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:07.960]   No, right.
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:08.960]   And we're not saying that.
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:12.760]   Because clearly, the issue is that the Chinese government can see everything.
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:15.880]   All they have to do is knock on the door and say, hey, TikTok, we want to see what's
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:16.880]   going on.
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:17.880]   Right.
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:18.920]   Ask the American government with Gmail.
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:19.920]   Yeah.
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:21.680]   There's my position is--
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:24.400]   We are being-- our privacy has been invaded by a lot of people.
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:28.280]   TikTok is the least of your worries.
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:29.280]   What are they going to do?
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:33.760]   I think if you're a Chinese national overseas Chinese national, don't use TikTok.
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.320]   Of course not.
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:39.080]   You shouldn't use WeChat either, which you do, because that's how you stay in touch with
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:40.080]   your family.
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:42.160]   Yeah, I understand that.
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:47.600]   But me, you, Connie, what are they getting that's so scary?
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:54.280]   They're not getting a psychographic profile of who you are and what you're interested
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:55.920]   in and what you like and what you don't like.
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:00.920]   And by the way, TikTok is making this big push around the world, not yet in the US,
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:03.640]   to set up e-commerce shops so that you can buy stuff.
[00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:06.960]   Then I get even more data about what you liked and what you didn't like and what you
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:08.600]   bought and what you didn't buy.
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:13.800]   And so they're creating a profile of you at a very, very minute level, starting with
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.760]   what kind of dance music you like to or what--
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:16.760]   Instagram.
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:19.440]   So are you less worried about Instagram knowing all that?
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:22.200]   And by the way, they are selling stuff.
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:26.680]   So I'm going to repeat what Ian said as journalists who follow this stuff wrong, nervous about
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:27.680]   all of it.
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:30.160]   We don't know what they're doing with it.
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:32.480]   And Andy Grove is right.
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:34.320]   Only the paranoid survive.
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:39.800]   But I do remember that ask that everybody was so enamored with where you could put in
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:45.240]   your photo and then it would age you and show you what you look like as you got older.
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:46.240]   Oh, what's the big deal?
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.240]   It's just a game.
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:52.600]   Well, now somebody's building a world's database of every face on the planet.
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:55.040]   Well, how can that be used again?
[00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.040]   I agree.
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:59.560]   I mean, Cliff, you is doing this on an industrial scale.
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:02.240]   I do get slightly peeved when I see all these people.
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:05.440]   Oh, this is what an AI generator makes my face look like.
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:06.440]   It's like, right.
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:11.520]   So you've given that AI system six to eight pictures of your face.
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:13.560]   You think they're just going to delete those?
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:15.920]   It's just bonkers.
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:20.120]   I'm just more worried about American companies who without any restriction collecting information
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:25.160]   about us, which we allow because they're American, that seems to me as much of a danger.
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:30.560]   If not more, but the danger is they're going to try to sell you stuff.
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:33.680]   I'll compromise with you on this.
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:36.520]   And I'll say I'm worried about TikTok.
[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:40.480]   I'm also worried about American companies and I vote for stricter regulation on all of
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:41.480]   them.
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:42.480]   Yeah.
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:46.920]   It's all lagging behind the technology here with the regulatory structure, which to be
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:50.640]   clear, I know capitalism and it's important to have some free space at the frontiers and
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:51.640]   blah, blah, blah.
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:53.240]   But like, you know, this stuff isn't new anymore.
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:55.000]   We should have better rules about it.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.160]   But this came up with my life because having a kid and we're trying to think about how
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.720]   we can share pictures of her.
[00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:01.360]   Oh, get ready, baby.
[00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:05.440]   And the hospital, the hospital will sell information about this birth.
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.440]   Yeah.
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:11.240]   And you and your child will be notified with a draft notice at the age of 18, thanks to
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:12.240]   the hospital.
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:17.320]   And at age 21, we'll start receiving mail saying, and now that you're 21, because everybody
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:19.640]   knows exactly all their, you know, this is amazing.
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:21.640]   The hospital's been selling that information.
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:25.960]   I'm just, I'm trying to think of a way to share pictures of the kiddo with our extended
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:30.680]   network without either giving the information to a major platform or making it publicly
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:31.680]   accessible.
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:35.440]   And the answer appears to be printing out photographs and mailing them.
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:38.760]   So I'm a little disappointed by how invasive ad tech is.
[00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:43.000]   So somebody in our chatroom, Berntex says, well, the reason this is a problem is because
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:48.120]   communism is going to do with the data different than what Instagram or other US companies do
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:49.120]   with it.
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:52.040]   What is communism going to do with all that data?
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:53.040]   Oh my God.
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:54.040]   Have you been to China?
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:29:55.040]   I mean, sir, yes.
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:57.560]   I mean, the first time I went to China.
[00:29:57.560 --> 00:29:59.160]   Are you worried about religious persecution?
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:00.160]   No, no.
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:05.000]   It's when you go to China, you realize, yeah, they are communist in terms of state controllable
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   and very capitalistic.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.640]   When it comes to business, they're capitalistic.
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:11.520]   And they're better at it than we are because they have fewer.
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:13.520]   Whoa, Alex.
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:14.520]   Are you having a baby?
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:15.520]   Oh, OK.
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:16.520]   He doesn't like it.
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:17.520]   Oh, wait.
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:18.520]   No, no, I was just complaining.
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:19.520]   I didn't mean to cut you off.
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:20.520]   Now I feel terribly rude.
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:23.680]   I was just going to complain about your capitalism point in China, but please, you can.
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:29.160]   No, all I'm saying is, I mean, they are hyper-capitalist, foot down on the floor all the way.
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.160]   Oh, it's amazing.
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:31.160]   Yeah.
[00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:33.160]   But I'm shopping in China is quite an experience.
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:38.240]   Not with the communist state control over it, but in terms of business, they have far fewer
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:43.480]   safeguards than we have in the US in terms of dealing with data, dealing with accidents.
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:47.120]   Yeah, they let Jack Ma do whatever he wanted until he went up against him.
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:49.200]   He went up against him and went against him.
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:51.120]   And then, of course, he's gone.
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:52.120]   Yeah.
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:56.360]   But I mean, that's really the big sin in China is not selling as much as you can.
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:59.240]   No, the big sin is going is running against the president.
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:00.240]   He's running against the president.
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:02.480]   In any way, it's all, in which case, you are absolutely screwed.
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:03.480]   I want to move on.
[00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:04.760]   We got a lot to talk about.
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:08.720]   We have only about three or four hours to talk about it.
[00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:10.800]   No, I won't do that to you.
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.880]   It's so good to have all three of you.
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:21.120]   Thank you, Connie Guillen, for being here, Editor-in-Chief at CNET, Ian Thompson, Editor, US Editor.
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.360]   But that's in chief.
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:24.600]   Is there somebody higher than you in the US?
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:29.440]   We have an Editor-in-Chief, but yeah, we're basically it's a flat hole.
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:31.440]   It's a very, you know, it's like it's a title.
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:32.440]   You have to have a title.
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:33.440]   You're registered.
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:35.680]   It's kind of like the Chinese Politburo.
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:36.680]   No.
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:38.680]   I was going to say I'm curious.
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:40.520]   No, but I mean, it's not a question.
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:41.840]   Yeah, I've finished that sentence.
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:43.600]   Everyone writes edits all cells.
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.360]   So, you know, it's a flat one.
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:46.360]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:49.960]   And of course, Alex Wilhelm, who is, in fact, Editor-in-Chief of TechCrunch.
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:51.720]   Plus, that's new, right?
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:52.720]   You stopped doing that.
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:55.240]   Now you're back doing that?
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:59.960]   Lutz TechCrunch came back and then ended up helping out run the, the solution side of
[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:00.960]   the other side.
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:03.560]   I mean, for a while, you were just a reporter at TechCrunch.
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:04.560]   Yeah.
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:05.960]   Now you're manager again.
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:08.440]   They keep pulling you in.
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:12.080]   Once you've managed people once, people want you to keep doing it because managing people,
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:16.120]   as I'm sure Connie knows, is the funnest and most edifying thing.
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:17.120]   Oh, God.
[00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:19.840]   It is one of those weird dichotomies about journalism.
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:22.960]   There's a bunch of better you get at it than the less the leader do it.
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:23.960]   That's the Peter principle.
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:25.480]   That's the Peter principle.
[00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:28.560]   People rise to their level of incompetence.
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:30.400]   And I have reached mine.
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:34.240]   Our show today brought to you by Ryan Reynolds.
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:36.120]   No, by Mint Mobile.
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:40.680]   Although I have to say Ryan Reynolds ads for Mint Mobile are fantastic.
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:45.520]   This holiday season, the best deal and wireless, forget all those ads you're going to see.
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:46.520]   Oh, gosh.
[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:52.240]   I hate these ads where they get big celebrities and all these, you know, personalities saying
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:53.960]   how great they are.
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:54.960]   And this is why I love Ryan.
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:55.960]   He says, no, no, no, no.
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:58.920]   We're just going to give you the best deal and spend the money.
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:02.120]   You know, forget the money we're spending on marketing and we're going to give you the
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:04.600]   deal right now when you switch to Mint Mobile.
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:06.520]   Get this and buy any three month plan.
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:10.600]   Just add another three months for free for free.
[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:14.040]   The first companies sell premium wireless service online only.
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:15.200]   And that means they save.
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:18.920]   They not only buy cheap ads, they, they don't have stores.
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:20.840]   They don't waste money on a bunch of other stuff.
[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:24.480]   They just, they just sell online.
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:27.240]   You can order and activate from your very home.
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:29.440]   In fact, now they support e-sim, which is great.
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:31.000]   You don't even have to get a sim mailed to you.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.280]   You can just put it in and you're going to save tons in the phone plan.
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:37.400]   Now people always come to me and say, I got a great deal.
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:39.720]   I'm only paying 75 bucks a month.
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:41.560]   I'm only paying 50 bucks a month.
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:49.040]   How about $15 a month for unlimited nationwide talk and text high speed data on the nation's
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:53.320]   largest 5G network, 15 bucks a month.
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:54.320]   Come on.
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:55.320]   Beat that.
[00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:56.400]   I guarantee you I've looked.
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:57.920]   No one can beat that.
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:00.320]   That is a great, great service.
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:03.080]   I've been using Mint Mobile now for two years.
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:04.920]   This would be a great time to switch.
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:07.760]   I got to tell you, there's a sting when you get your sell bill from those other guys.
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:12.360]   It's big and seems to get bigger and there's almost hidden fees and, you know, weird stuff
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:13.880]   they add to that.
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:14.880]   No Mint Mobile.
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:15.880]   It's very simple.
[00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:16.880]   No hidden fees.
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:17.880]   No magic stuff.
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:19.760]   Just 15 bucks a month.
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:22.040]   And for a limited time, buy any three months plan.
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:25.360]   You get three more months free.
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:30.840]   By going online only with e-sim eliminating the cost of those stores, Mint Mobile passes
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:33.440]   significant savings on to you.
[00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:35.800]   All their plans, unlimited talk and text high speed data.
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:36.920]   I'll tell you the secret.
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:37.920]   They're on T-Mobile.
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:40.440]   They're T-Mobile and VMO and VNO.
[00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:43.840]   So if you get good T-Mobile service, you're going to get good Mint Mobile service.
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:45.160]   It's great.
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:49.960]   And by the way, yeah, I'm getting 5G T-Mobile calls that you see ultra capacity, almost
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:52.400]   everywhere, almost everywhere now.
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:54.080]   It's amazing.
[00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:58.680]   Using your phone if you want, switch effortlessly with e-sim if your phone supports it.
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:01.960]   If you need a new device, they sell phones too.
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:05.960]   A great place to get an iPhone SE or iPhone 14.
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:10.080]   And for a limited time, you'll get six months of service free when you buy a select device
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:11.080]   and plan.
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:12.080]   Wait a minute.
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:13.080]   They buried the lead.
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:16.440]   Half a year free when you buy a phone from them.
[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:17.440]   Switch to Mint Mobile.
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:20.080]   You'll get premium wireless service.
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:21.080]   Great service.
[00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:23.040]   15 bucks a month.
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.040]   They have unlimited plans.
[00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:25.240]   They have other plans as well.
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:27.560]   15 bucks a month is 4 gigabytes of data a month.
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:30.400]   For most people, that's all you need.
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:32.040]   Why are you paying more?
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:35.840]   Cut your wireless bill to 15 bucks a month.
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:40.720]   For a limited time by any three month Mint Mobile plan, get three months more free.
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:43.560]   Go to mintmobile.com/twit.
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:48.240]   Mintmobile.com/twit.
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:50.600]   This is absolutely the best deal in cell phones.
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:52.840]   And there's just no reason not to do it.
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:54.440]   Mintmobile.com/twit.
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:57.760]   Thank you, Mint Mobile, for supporting this week in tech.
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:35:58.760]   You support us too.
[00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:03.240]   And this is very important by using that address, that extra little thing at the end/twit because
[00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:05.360]   that's how they know you saw it here.
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:06.440]   Mintmobile.com/twit.
[00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:10.920]   This surprised me, you just briefly mentioned this.
[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:16.160]   Bloomberg had a story this week that e-sports is fading.
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:20.440]   The hype around e-sports is fading as investors and sponsors dry up.
[00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:23.640]   And I was just saying a couple of weeks ago, I thought e-sports was about to take over
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:26.120]   from the NFL and FIFA and everybody.
[00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:29.840]   I guess I was wrong.
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:31.440]   Funding sources are dwindling.
[00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:32.440]   Signs abound.
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:35.560]   This is Cecilia D'Nestazio at Bloomberg writing.
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:39.240]   Signs abound at athletic competition via video games.
[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:44.000]   It doesn't have anywhere near the earning potential investors anticipated.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.560]   Doesn't this come back to what you were saying, Connie?
[00:36:47.560 --> 00:36:49.720]   We're coming out of lockdown now.
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:57.400]   So just sitting in playing games all the time isn't the option that it was a couple of years
[00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:58.400]   ago.
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:02.760]   Well, I think people want to sit around and watch games as everybody I know is going
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:04.560]   to watch in the world.
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:10.080]   But yes, I think the market is changing.
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:14.600]   But I also think one of the biggest changes is that the ad market is collapsing.
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:18.720]   And by that I mean a lot of advertisers are concerned about inflation and the recession,
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:22.400]   whether we're in a recession or not, and they pull back their ad spend.
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.760]   And that is affecting everyone.
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:28.200]   All media companies are seeing a massive shortfall in ad spending because companies
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:30.160]   who have the dollars are very cautious.
[00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:34.560]   And that obviously affects this e-sports industry where advertising is going to be a big chunk
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:35.560]   of their revenue.
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:40.240]   So if you don't have money to invest and there's no growth, well that causes a little bit of
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:42.840]   a problem no matter what business you're in.
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:45.600]   Well, but that's an interesting question.
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:48.240]   Isn't this just a part of the economic cycle?
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:53.040]   It's down now, but it'll come back, God, I hope it'll come back later because we're
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:55.200]   seeing that too and podcast ad sales.
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.200]   I don't know.
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:58.320]   I think it's working in some regards.
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:02.560]   I mean, Alex and I are both not sure about the con, but I mean we're both forming the
[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:07.120]   one fans and went down in the down season at the moment.
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:11.520]   And now e-sports is trying to take over and you try watching some of these races and
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:13.240]   now it's nowhere near as much fun.
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:17.240]   But I always think when I think of that, I think of how I enjoy cricket.
[00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:18.840]   I don't know the game.
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:19.840]   So I don't.
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:20.840]   Right?
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:25.440]   And I think to some degree, frankly, I found the same thing with soccer.
[00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:30.560]   I mean that one, that game between England and the US, nothing, nothing.
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:37.600]   Thai, that to me was like watching paint dry, but that's, I recognize that's probably because
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:41.280]   I don't have the same, you know, understanding of the sport.
[00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:43.680]   So maybe that's all that's missing in e-sports.
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:45.720]   Maybe you need to learn more about Dota 2.
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:48.960]   Because it's virtual, you lose something.
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:54.280]   You know, if it's not, I've tried watching e-sports racing and there's not that, you
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:39:00.040]   know, a car, two cars bump together and the software, you know, puts a slows one down
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:01.040]   a bit and the rest of it.
[00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:02.920]   But it's not quite the same.
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:09.880]   I think the same with football, the same with probably his own a-sports baseball thing.
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:12.680]   But I mean, e-sports cricket, I can't imagine anything worse.
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:14.440]   But nobody's doing e-sports cricket.
[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:15.440]   You're right.
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:19.800]   But there were- Sports baseball sounds like something that you have to do and how.
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:21.840]   I think they're doing League of Legends.
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:22.840]   They're doing Dota 2.
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:23.840]   They're mostly doing mobas.
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:29.520]   They're doing games that are starcraft that are exciting to watch that you can have a
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:30.520]   team.
[00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:32.440]   Alex, you're a fan, right?
[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:36.480]   I'm an enormous e-sports fan and I'm also not surprised that this is where we're ending
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:42.280]   up right now because there was a boom of excitement in terms of what these teams might
[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:47.000]   be worth, what these leaks might be able to put out and it got ahead of the underlying
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.160]   strength of the industry.
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:51.720]   And so now we're seeing kind of the come up and stuff that I agree that the ad pocalypse
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:55.800]   that every single one of us in the publishing world is staring down because publications
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:56.800]   are shutting down.
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:57.880]   Everyone's worried about ad sales.
[00:39:57.880 --> 00:39:59.800]   Of course, it's going to impact e-sports.
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:03.120]   But really, I just think that people put a little bit more capital than the industry
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:05.560]   could properly digest into it.
[00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:07.680]   And now we're seeing that kind of shake out.
[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:08.920]   It's a disappointment.
[00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:10.560]   But here's what I'll say.
[00:40:10.560 --> 00:40:14.160]   Ten years ago, if I had said Leo, there's going to be legal legends tournaments that
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:18.000]   regularly fill stadiums around the world, probably I would have been chuckled at and
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.120]   I would have been fine.
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:20.440]   But that's still happening.
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:22.080]   So the e-sports boom is still here.
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:25.960]   It's just not going to become the NFL 2.0 that people hoped for.
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:29.200]   But many things were a little bit overhyped in the last couple of years and have come
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.200]   down since.
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:31.960]   So I don't think this is a uniquely e-sports thing.
[00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:37.760]   I'll just say, bummer, you know, do you think you'll come back?
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:44.320]   Because it's so funny because maybe this is just a side effect of the obsession with
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:48.360]   quarterly results and the way the stock market works that it's always would have you done
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:49.360]   for me lately.
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:52.480]   And there's no sense of long-term thinking.
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:53.480]   So it's down now.
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:54.480]   It's over.
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:58.320]   But it's normal for there to be ups and downs.
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:04.240]   All of tech is going down because there was such a high during COVID.
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:08.240]   And now it's recovering, probably not, to the level even before COVID.
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:11.280]   I mean, if you look at stock prices for the most part, they're still ahead of January
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:12.640]   2020.
[00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:18.800]   So I feel like it's a short-sighted thing to say, oh, yeah, e-sports is over.
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:19.800]   Or is it?
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:20.800]   Is it really, is it conny?
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:23.960]   I mean, isn't this just part of the ups and downs?
[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:29.000]   I mean, yeah, we're all, you know, I'm sure CNET's ad sales is, I'm not going to put words
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.680]   in your mouth, but I know our ad sales are tightening.
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:34.880]   I think that's just, but it's going to, but I have a faith in it.
[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:36.720]   Is it going to come back?
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:38.960]   Yeah, I think it's going to come back.
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:42.800]   I mean, I was just listening to everything that we're saying about just the quarterly
[00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:44.920]   cycle and people looking for revenue.
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:48.640]   And somebody spent seven years covering public companies at Bloomberg.
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:52.280]   Yes, people want profit now.
[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:54.280]   Instant gratification takes too long.
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:56.760]   So is it going to come back or not?
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:57.760]   Should it?
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:01.360]   I don't know the answer to that question because I am not an e-sports fan.
[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:02.800]   All credit to you, Alex, for doing it.
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:04.800]   I like to go outside.
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:06.920]   Oh, this is good.
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:07.920]   This is good.
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:09.920]   The shots fired back and forth.
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:13.120]   I was going to apologize for taking a shot at Leo earlier, but now they know the guns
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:14.120]   are out.
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:15.120]   I'm not going away.
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:16.120]   Okay.
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:17.120]   Everybody.
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:19.120]   Well, I'm just saying that because you're about to knock a fuck off.
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:20.120]   If everyone, calm down, calm down.
[00:42:20.120 --> 00:42:21.280]   No, you're right, Connie.
[00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:22.280]   So that's good.
[00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:24.040]   I forget that you also covered business for a long time.
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:27.520]   So you really, you've seen this business cycle before.
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:33.440]   And I have to tell you, I have become extremely cynical about business in the US right now.
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:37.200]   Look, people want profits at all costs.
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:42.000]   And this idea that we have to have so many billionaires and that that is the aspirational
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.400]   goal of people coming out of school, not to build something amazing, but to become a
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:47.400]   billionaire.
[00:42:47.400 --> 00:42:51.600]   I mean, that kind of worries me and makes me very, very sad.
[00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:54.240]   What are we looking at right now in the tech industry in general?
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:57.040]   We're looking at companies laying off tons of people.
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:00.960]   Is it because those people were doing a great job and the market has shrunk?
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:03.480]   No, it's part of the correction of those companies.
[00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:04.840]   They grew too fast.
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:05.840]   They're a little bit bloated.
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:10.640]   So they're taking an opportunity in the market to retrench, which is what every business
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:14.280]   does whenever there's a downturn in the economy.
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:18.560]   Does that mean that some businesses are not going to suffer more than answers?
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:22.640]   Of course, some businesses will go away because the business market will dry out for them.
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:28.160]   So it is definitely we live in a very unforgiving profit driven world.
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:31.120]   I mean, look at what happened at Twitter.
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:35.960]   Let's save on the single largest expense of any company and staff.
[00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:39.680]   So let's go into Twitter and eviscerate 50% of the team.
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:42.280]   Did they need to cut 50% of those people?
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:43.280]   Maybe.
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:44.280]   I don't know.
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:48.080]   I don't have the inside track on what everybody was doing at Twitter, but you know that there's
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:50.440]   a more reasonable way to do it than that.
[00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:55.040]   But this quest for the all-mining dollar has really beaten hold.
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:58.040]   And even I'm going to get off my soapbox in just a second.
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:02.480]   I was watching a documentary not too long ago about Hershey, the guy who started Hershey's
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:03.480]   chocolate.
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:06.560]   And he set up his company town in Hershey, Pennsylvania.
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:10.840]   And you know, employed all of the people who actually also ran in town.
[00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:15.200]   And somebody, he went out one day to the field and someone was showing him a tractor.
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:19.000]   And said, look at this, we can now have these tractors and we'll do the work of 40 men.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.280]   It was the start of the depression.
[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:24.640]   And he said, park the tractors and hire the 40 people because it's more important that
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:26.520]   we keep those people's livelihood.
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:30.920]   Can you imagine any of our tech giants having that argument with themselves today?
[00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:34.280]   And so, yes, it is a quest for almighty dollar.
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:39.520]   The tech companies are the analog of the tractor seller in this story, right?
[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:41.320]   They're selling the tractors.
[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:44.520]   They want to put people out of the job market.
[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:47.760]   Well, no, I mean, the, sorry, Alex, sorry, and please.
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:49.480]   No, no, off to you, Mike.
[00:44:49.480 --> 00:44:50.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:52.960]   I'll just say, can you start hating each other like you hate me?
[00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:53.960]   Come on.
[00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:56.480]   No, do friendly.
[00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:58.120]   We knock it off.
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:44:59.800]   He likes watching cars go fast.
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:01.280]   I like watching cars go fast.
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:02.280]   Therefore, we're brothers.
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:03.280]   You know, you know what?
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:05.680]   You know what I'm doing in November of next year?
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:06.680]   What are you doing?
[00:45:06.680 --> 00:45:07.680]   Las Vegas F1.
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:10.640]   Oh, my tickets got my hotel room.
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:11.640]   My word.
[00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:12.640]   Okay.
[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:13.640]   So there I'm sorry.
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:16.480]   I'm going to have to mug you after the after the.
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:17.480]   Sorry.
[00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:18.480]   Sorry.
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:23.120]   We're going to be sitting in the stands that are over the Bellagio fountains watching these
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:24.120]   cars.
[00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:25.120]   Sorry.
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:26.120]   Is that like getting a million dollar car?
[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:27.120]   Yeah.
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:30.480]   There's million dollar cars traveling down the strip at 200 miles an hour.
[00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:32.120]   I cannot wait.
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:33.120]   That's it's over.
[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:34.640]   That's going to be, it's going to be excellent.
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:40.240]   But back to the, the, sorry about, no, no, you're fine.
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:43.080]   About tech companies and their approach to labor.
[00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:46.440]   If you go to a lot of these major tech companies back in the day, you know, pre-COVID.
[00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:51.880]   A lot of their workers were essentially contracted out to third company, third party companies.
[00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:54.840]   Because that way they didn't have to employ them and kind of pay them.
[00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:57.320]   This was the bus drivers, the people who still have these.
[00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:59.520]   Microsoft hires tons of contractors.
[00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:00.520]   Yeah.
[00:46:00.520 --> 00:46:02.000]   So they don't through a third party company.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.280]   So they don't have to pay them benefits and they don't have to deal with labor issues
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:06.280]   and so forth.
[00:46:06.280 --> 00:46:07.280]   And I think it's a disgrace.
[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:10.960]   And I think it shows that American capitalism, which I am fun.
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:17.280]   I'm still net positive in favor of has some rot in it that we could exterminate.
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:21.080]   It depresses me how we treat people.
[00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:24.680]   And back to the esports point, it's, it is cyclical, but I'll just say that I think it's
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:27.080]   going to be here forever and it's not going to die.
[00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:30.800]   It'll just be a sad place for a couple of years and it'll come back.
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:36.000]   Do you think long term is the real question is so then long term, can esports truly be
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:41.640]   as engaging and as we don't want to measure it in profit, but might as well profitable
[00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:48.720]   as the big sports today NFL and NBA and well, I mean, the major profit in sports is broadcasting
[00:46:48.720 --> 00:46:50.480]   and then and celery services.
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:51.480]   Yeah.
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:56.800]   Now broadcasting, esports can take some of that, but you know, there's an enormous amount
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:47:01.040]   of money goes into the stadiums, into stuff that sold live.
[00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:02.040]   That's true.
[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:04.200]   I mean, there are esports stadiums all over the country now.
[00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:05.200]   Yeah.
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:11.360]   And I have to say, I watched, I was watching the League of Legends, I think it was League
[00:47:11.360 --> 00:47:13.840]   of Legends finale in San Francisco.
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:18.080]   Did you see the, they had little NASX in the opening show and everything?
[00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:22.040]   I think I played a little bit of that except it probably was taken down on the show a couple
[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:23.880]   of weeks ago.
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:28.240]   But what was impressing to me, impressive to me and boats, to me, boats well in long
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:32.760]   term is the announcers to five years ago, esports announcers were terrible.
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:33.760]   Right?
[00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:37.320]   They were, they were, they sucked the life out of the thing.
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:39.320]   Now they're good.
[00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:42.400]   They are as good as any NFL or NBA announcer.
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:48.360]   They bring life to it and they need to because these games are complicated, hard to understand
[00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:49.360]   and they need to bring people in.
[00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:53.840]   There's also the problem of, and this may be a more intractable problem, the people playing
[00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:56.800]   these games don't look so good.
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:48:01.280]   Because when you're playing a game like Dota 2, you're kind of short and short and classy.
[00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:03.600]   Have you seen British rugby players?
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:04.600]   I mean, this is like...
[00:48:04.600 --> 00:48:05.600]   No, they're good looking.
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:07.680]   No, but they're good looking.
[00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:12.480]   These guys, they, I mean, watching somebody play a game is not a, I mean, that's bad,
[00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:13.480]   right there.
[00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:17.320]   Well, you don't, you don't watch the esports game to watch the players faces.
[00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:18.320]   But that's a problem.
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:19.320]   That's a problem.
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:22.960]   That's, I mean, up close and personal.
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:25.840]   We need to get up close and personal with these guys.
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:28.920]   I will say that esports announcements has gotten a lot better.
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:29.920]   It's really.
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:30.920]   Yes, boy.
[00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:35.680]   Especially the, the League of Legends teams have some really, really insanely high levels
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:36.680]   of prep.
[00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:42.440]   I watched a backstage type video of one League of Legends tournament and how they had the
[00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:44.800]   meetings talking about the matches that were coming up and what they were going to talk
[00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:45.800]   about.
[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:46.800]   Yeah.
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:51.280]   And it was just a level of preparation that I found just very professional and impressive.
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:54.480]   And so they put in the work, but I will say I haven't played League of Legends in a couple
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:55.480]   years.
[00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:56.480]   I played other stuff.
[00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:59.120]   And I came back to watching a little bit of the last world and I was like, they've
[00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:00.120]   changed everything.
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:01.120]   Oh, no.
[00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:02.200]   What are, what are these symbols?
[00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:04.400]   And I felt like, uh, now you know how I feel.
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:05.760]   Yeah, it's like what's going on.
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:06.760]   Yeah.
[00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:07.760]   Yeah.
[00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:08.760]   It's, you have to stay current.
[00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:10.040]   And I think that's tough given the amount of competition out there.
[00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:14.160]   There's not that many sports that make it on TV, frankly.
[00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:15.160]   That's going to hurt.
[00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:17.680]   That is going to hurt esports because you have to pick a winner.
[00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:20.240]   You have to have 15 games at everybody plays.
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:21.440]   It's too many.
[00:49:21.440 --> 00:49:22.440]   You got to pick one.
[00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:25.200]   No one's ever going to watch an age of empathy sports thing.
[00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:26.480]   Oh, I was.
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:27.480]   That's exciting.
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:29.040]   Yeah, but it takes hours.
[00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:30.040]   That's true.
[00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:31.040]   You got to speak.
[00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:33.720]   So does it look like looking at the great game takes weeks.
[00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:34.720]   So come on.
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:40.160]   Yeah, but you know, I think I think we can take Connie's camera shot as indicative of
[00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:42.160]   what the audience feels about.
[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:43.160]   She's so bored.
[00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:44.160]   I'm sorry.
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:45.160]   All right.
[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:47.160]   Let's let's it's true.
[00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:49.160]   Yeah, it's true.
[00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:51.040]   Moving moving on already.
[00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:52.040]   Never mind.
[00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:53.040]   I'm sorry I brought it up.
[00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:54.040]   Let's take a little break.
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:55.040]   We'll come back with more.
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:56.040]   What?
[00:49:56.040 --> 00:50:04.200]   Are you sure today my friends brought to you by Express V.P.N.
[00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:08.560]   Now I have to tell you it comes up a lot for a lot of people where you're somewhere
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:14.000]   where you want to watch, you know, that game or you want to watch that movie, but geographic
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:16.560]   restrictions prevent you from doing so.
[00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:22.720]   That's one of the three main reasons people use virtual private networks.
[00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:26.040]   And then other reason, of course, you know, this is security when you're on open Wi-Fi
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:27.360]   access point.
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:31.280]   It's a very good idea to encrypt all your traffic, not just some of your traffic.
[00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:32.480]   That's what a VPN does.
[00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:34.200]   So nobody can spy on you.
[00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:36.840]   And the third one is privacy.
[00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:42.360]   Now maybe you've heard, but Santa Claus is coming to town, but Santa Claus keeps the most
[00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:48.440]   privacy invasive list in the world, the naughty or nice list.
[00:50:48.440 --> 00:50:50.400]   He knows when you are sleeping.
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:51.720]   He's knows when you are awake.
[00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:54.520]   Now you need a VPN.
[00:50:54.520 --> 00:51:01.600]   You definitely, you if you cannot avoid the all seeing eye of your internet service provider.
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:07.160]   And by the way, it's completely legal in this country and it is a widespread thing to do
[00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:13.440]   to sell your information about what you do on the internet to third party marketers.
[00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:16.840]   That's one, you know, Facebook isn't going to sell it because they want to keep it to
[00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:18.200]   themselves.
[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:21.000]   But the internet service providers, they are ad companies.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:27.920]   There are information gathering sucking companies that want to sell it to third parties.
[00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:35.760]   This holiday season, protect yourself online, get rid of the regional restrictions you don't
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:41.320]   need and give yourself and your loved ones the gift of privacy, express VPN.
[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:44.560]   You said, Oh, I use privacy mode in my browser.
[00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:47.760]   No, that doesn't mean that doesn't mean anything.
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:53.160]   It keeps it all it does is it keeps your browser history invisible to people in your house.
[00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:58.120]   Your internet provider, AT&T, Verizon, Comcast, they see everything you're doing, everything
[00:51:58.120 --> 00:51:59.120]   you're doing.
[00:51:59.120 --> 00:52:00.360]   They know how much time you spend on each site.
[00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:05.480]   They almost certainly sold it to advertisers with express VPN.
[00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:08.080]   All your traffic gets rerouted through an encrypted service.
[00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:12.520]   Your browsing activity remains entirely your business.
[00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:14.560]   Now I'm going to add one more thing.
[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:16.320]   There are many VPNs to choose from.
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:17.320]   Why do I prefer?
[00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:19.040]   Why do I tell you you use express VPN?
[00:52:19.040 --> 00:52:21.040]   Why do I use it myself?
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:26.120]   Because you also have to worry about your privacy with a VPN provider and a free VPN provider
[00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:27.960]   is not protecting your privacy.
[00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:29.920]   They're making money on you.
[00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:34.960]   Express VPNs affordable less than seven bucks a month with our offer, but still that's I
[00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:38.200]   think that's a good price, but you want a VPN provider to cost money.
[00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:41.840]   You want a VPN provider that guarantees your privacy.
[00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:46.120]   Express VPN is independently audited to make sure that they adhere to their privacy policy.
[00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:53.160]   The independent auditors also said that express VPNs trusted server technology works as advertised.
[00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:54.400]   I love this.
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:53:00.280]   They went the extra mile express VPN actually writes open source software for their own use,
[00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:05.960]   the trusted server software so that when you use the server, it spins up in RAM sandbox.
[00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:06.960]   I can't write to the hard drive.
[00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:09.080]   And as soon as you leave the server, it closes.
[00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:14.880]   You get your very own trusted server and not a trace of your visit exists nowhere on the
[00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:15.880]   servers.
[00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:17.640]   They couldn't sell that information if they want to.
[00:53:17.640 --> 00:53:22.040]   They have actually taken the steps plus they run a special Debian distribution for all
[00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:25.480]   their servers that gets completely wiped every day.
[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:31.140]   So even if they somehow something got logged to the disk, it's gone by the next morning.
[00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:36.280]   We know this is true not just from independent audits, but from governments, not live on
[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:40.720]   ours, but governments with no knock warrants who've taken these servers and said, Oh, there's
[00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:42.280]   nothing on it.
[00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:48.320]   It's so easy to use Express VPN as an app for everybody, every phone, every operating system.
[00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:52.400]   They even have Express VPN routers or you could put it on your existing router in some
[00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:55.200]   cases, you don't have to have a compatible router.
[00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:58.440]   And that's great because then you get up whole house protection and Express VPN invests in
[00:53:58.440 --> 00:53:59.440]   there.
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:03.920]   The other reason why you like you want to use a Express VPN, they invest in their servers.
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:04.920]   So the speed is so good.
[00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:07.120]   You will never feel like, Oh, I don't want to use this.
[00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:08.200]   It's too slow.
[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:10.360]   It's just as fast as your internet.
[00:54:10.360 --> 00:54:15.160]   They also, and this is a more technical thing, but they rotate their IP addresses.
[00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:19.760]   You may wonder, well, how do people know I'm on a VPN because those addresses get known,
[00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:20.760]   right?
[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:22.600]   And so BBC I player says, well, I know that address.
[00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:23.880]   That's a VPN.
[00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:27.440]   If you rotate your IP addresses, if you have fresh IP addresses all the time, that doesn't
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:28.440]   happen.
[00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:34.000]   Another reason to use Express VPN, take yourself off centers, naughty list with the number
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:40.040]   one rated VPN service, visit Express VPN.com slash three extra months free when you buy a
[00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:41.040]   one year plan.

[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:44.920]   I think that's a very good price.
[00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:46.320]   This is the one I use.
[00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:51.400]   eXPR ESS VPN.com slash to express VPN.

[00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:23.800]   You also get the discord, which is the best darn community ever.

[00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:02.160]   We have a yearly plan.
[00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:04.800]   That might be a nice gift.
[00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:08.040]   Twit.tv/clubtwit.
[00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:12.680]   Thank you in advance.
[00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:14.280]   You're all on Twitter.
[00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:16.120]   You're all on Twitter.
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:17.120]   Yep.
[00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:18.120]   So, yep.
[00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:19.120]   Yep.
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:20.560]   It's not, no, it's not a job to write.
[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:22.320]   You know, we, I guess it's journalists.
[00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:24.880]   We watch the show, you know, we watch how it goes.
[00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:27.680]   If you weren't a journalist, if you're just a normal person, you probably wouldn't even
[00:56:27.680 --> 00:56:28.680]   be out.
[00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:29.680]   You would have never been on Twitter.
[00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:30.680]   Probably.
[00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:31.680]   Wow.
[00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:32.680]   I mean, it was.
[00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:36.920]   So, trying to get normal people to use Twitter still is impossible.
[00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:38.080]   They're like, what would I post?
[00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:39.560]   And I'm like, I don't know, whatever you're thinking.
[00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:42.040]   They're like, yeah, Pat, I'm not going to do that.
[00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:46.320]   I think it's kind of a valued thing though, because my parents aren't on Twitter.
[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:47.920]   My sister isn't on Twitter.
[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:53.440]   So it's like there, you know, Facebook, yeah, still on it because it keeps being contact
[00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:54.440]   with Europe.
[00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:58.080]   But, you know, with Twitter, you can just like, yeah, okay, you know, no one else is
[00:56:58.080 --> 00:56:59.400]   going to read this in the family.
[00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:01.160]   So it's not going to come up with a Christmas party.
[00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:02.160]   So, yeah.
[00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:03.160]   What is so?
[00:57:03.160 --> 00:57:05.480]   No, I still don't understand why.
[00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:07.480]   I guess he wanted to do this because he had to, right?
[00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:08.480]   He had no choice.
[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:10.360]   He courts were going to make him do it.
[00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:11.480]   So he just said, all right, fine.
[00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:13.040]   He didn't really want it.
[00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:14.600]   Now he's got it.
[00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:16.520]   And now he's burning it to the ground.
[00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:17.520]   Yeah.
[00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:18.520]   It's 12 hours ago.
[00:57:18.520 --> 00:57:19.520]   He that posts.
[00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:20.680]   He's starting to come out.
[00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:24.920]   He's starting to come out in public with his crazy QAnon beliefs.
[00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:28.840]   Well, no, but if you are you talking about the prosecute Fauci.
[00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:31.240]   My pronouns are prosecute Fauci.
[00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:35.120]   This is a unique tweet because it pisses people off in a variety of ways.
[00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:39.480]   You see, if you're looking at this stuff, he's done like Fauci for what?
[00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:40.480]   Yeah.
[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:42.000]   First of all, looking at the follow on tweets.
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:47.080]   So he's trying to put play, portray this as, you know, I'm just checking to see what
[00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:48.080]   the bots are.
[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:49.080]   That's what the net jobs do.
[00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:50.080]   They say, oh, he's joking.
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:52.080]   You know, it's just a joke.
[00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:53.680]   Why are you taking it to a series?
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:56.760]   It's just I can only assume he was smoking heavily today.
[00:57:56.760 --> 00:58:01.080]   Oh, who I don't want to give him any, any excuses at all.
[00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:02.080]   Did you?
[00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:10.400]   Now, on the other hand, I am looking forward to buying one of Twitter's old coffee machines.
[00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:11.480]   So there's that.
[00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:16.480]   I guess he's figured out another way.
[00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:22.640]   Another way to make money besides firing everybody is having a massive auction of all
[00:58:22.640 --> 00:58:23.640]   the Twitter stuff.
[00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:24.640]   Have you seen this?
[00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:26.120]   This goes on sale.
[00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:30.440]   I think it's a one day only sale from the Heritage Global auction house.
[00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:36.960]   Uh, surplus corporate assets of Twitter featuring kitchen equipment, electronics, furniture, memorabilia.
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:41.200]   Look, they have a hundred Twitter bird statues.
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:42.960]   I would buy one of those.
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:43.960]   I would love that.
[00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:45.600]   I can't tell how big it is.
[00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:46.600]   Yes.
[00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:47.600]   The question.
[00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:49.000]   Can I put it like as a living room like feature?
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.600]   How about an at sign sculpture planner?
[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:52.600]   It's old.
[00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:53.600]   What?
[00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:54.600]   Send me this URL.
[00:58:54.600 --> 00:58:55.600]   I'm going to.
[00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:56.600]   Bitchpotter.com.
[00:58:56.600 --> 00:59:00.480]   Beautiful Eames chairs, molded plywood lounge chairs.
[00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:01.760]   Those are expensive.
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:04.680]   Their starting bids are low, but you know, they'll go up quickly.
[00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:08.960]   It's only a 24 hour auction January 17th, but wait, there's more.
[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:13.000]   Look, here's a beautiful coffee machine.
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:16.040]   That's a beautiful $25.
[00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:17.040]   Why are that in your house?
[00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:19.960]   You'll never have to go to Starbucks again.
[00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:20.960]   A Mars.
[00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:22.160]   Is this a.
[00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:23.160]   Mars.
[00:59:23.160 --> 00:59:24.160]   Mars.
[00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:27.200]   There are quite a few of those actually.
[00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:28.200]   Some bird grinded.
[00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:33.920]   I think this is also a performance of some degree like Elon is showing how pampered and
[00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:35.680]   overindulged the employees.
[00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:37.840]   I think there's an element of that.
[00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:41.720]   As someone in the forum, there's no shade of crystal water is going to be onto this.
[00:59:41.720 --> 00:59:43.520]   Oh, she'll love this.
[00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:46.840]   Under counter freezer drawers, they shut down the cafeteria.
[00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:51.040]   In fact, there was a sad tweet from the people who had been making food for Twitter employees
[00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:54.560]   for more than a decade saying, thanks, it's been fun.
[00:59:54.560 --> 00:59:55.560]   Goodbye.
[00:59:55.560 --> 00:59:56.560]   It was a good cafe.
[00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:57.560]   It has to be said.
[00:59:57.560 --> 00:59:58.560]   I've never been there.
[00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:01.800]   I know the food, the food there was very, very good, but I mean, be lines right to close
[01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:02.960]   it down.
[01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:08.880]   You know, yeah, on the other hand, I mean, the point is how about this gas deck type
[01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:11.160]   pizza oven.
[01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:12.160]   We could open a Pepe's.
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:17.760]   I have to say, that's not something you need in the office, but I mean, hey, what's the
[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:20.160]   point of being a ridiculously wealthy tech company?
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:24.040]   If you can't have a pizza oven under a dresser, under a desk.
[01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:29.440]   It is kind of amazing because Twitter only had, I think, one profitable quarter, right?
[01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:30.440]   There wasn't.
[01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:32.240]   This was not a company making money over the last 17 years.
[01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:35.800]   Well, San Francisco City authorities are going to be slightly peeved because they gave
[01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:40.880]   Twitter this sweetheart deal on building a tax deal on building their headquarters in
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:42.280]   the tenderloin.
[01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:46.600]   And if the cafes shut down, then Twitter employees are going to go out and have to go out and
[01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:51.680]   find food in the tenderloin, which it's not in the tenderloin.
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:52.680]   It's nearby.
[01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:54.040]   Oh, it's on Market Street.
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:55.840]   It's on Market Street.
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:59.640]   Well, so was UN Plaza and I worked there for a year and a half.
[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:00.640]   That was enough.
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:04.920]   And that was, you know, when you see people, no, I can't say it.
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:09.040]   It's too rude, but it's not a nice area.
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:14.920]   The Twitter cafe is part of the dis against Twitter because they did get a discount and
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:20.320]   all sorts of tax credits from San Francisco to set up their headquarters on this corner
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:22.120]   of a marginally sketchy neighborhood.
[01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:23.480]   How about we call it that?
[01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:24.480]   Yes, that's fine.
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:29.640]   And the idea was that Twitter would get these tax breaks because they would help revitalize
[01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:30.640]   that neighborhood.
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:36.360]   But what they ended up doing was creating this on site enclave that nobody ever wanted
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:37.440]   to leave, right?
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:41.880]   With excellent cafeteria and all sorts of foods and other perks.
[01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:42.880]   A risk done.
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:43.880]   Yeah.
[01:01:43.880 --> 01:01:45.760]   So they, there was, there were tweets.
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:47.400]   I mean, I'm sorry, there were protests outside.
[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:48.400]   Do you remember?
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:52.400]   And at some point, Twitter employees threw fruit out the window with the protesters and
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:55.760]   people were like, great, organic fruit.
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:59.040]   So it never really helped revitalize that neighborhood.
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:01.680]   So there's been criticism of that deal as well.
[01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:02.680]   Absolutely.
[01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:07.040]   That redates the current drama that was, you know, that was the door to you.
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:08.040]   Valid.
[01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:12.800]   I hear you, but I will say I will never listen to someone who has their own private jet.
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:16.080]   Tell me what other people shouldn't have when it comes to perks.
[01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:18.080]   The world's richest man.
[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:20.240]   Can't tell you to suck it up.
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:27.600]   All right, let's talk about the Twitter files because that's the larger story of the week.
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:32.480]   Actually, I thought TechCrunch, Devin Coldway had a very good piece.
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:33.480]   Musk's Twitter.
[01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:36.360]   So just the background, Musk has been teasing this for a week.
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:41.120]   He said, okay, two PM, I'm going to release all the secret moderation files that are going
[01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:45.640]   to show how biased Twitter trust and safety was.
[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:49.560]   And you know, the Hunter Biden laptop thing being the chief of these.
[01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:51.000]   Why did they make?
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.640]   Why did they take down those nude pictures of Hunter Biden?
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:59.120]   And then there's more, you know, about people they'd ban and so forth and so on.
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:01.240]   And I think Devin actually had a fairly reasonable take.
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:07.720]   He says, Musk's Twitter files offer a glimpse of the raw, complicated and thankless task
[01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:11.320]   of moderation.
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:16.720]   Of course, I think Elon really wants to kind of create this as some sort of scandal.
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:18.440]   Is he succeeding, Connie?
[01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:20.360]   Is it a scandal?
[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:21.800]   It depends on who you talk to.
[01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:29.400]   I mean, Elon Musk has been leaking or sharing this, these Twitter files, which I think TechCrunch,
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:33.920]   he did an excellent job breaking down that the there that they thought was there, that
[01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:36.080]   he's claiming is there is not there.
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:40.480]   But it shows a complicated issue when people actually being very thoughtful about how to
[01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:44.240]   curate content in a complex time.
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:51.000]   So anybody who actually reads that will see, oh, whatever Musk and his accolades are saying
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.000]   is false.
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.560]   But the problem is most people won't read.
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:54.560]   They don't read that.
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:55.560]   What is actually?
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:04:00.600]   They just read what Matt Taibbi and Barry Weiss to right wing hacks have to say about
[01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:01.600]   it.
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:03.480]   So it's very biased, I think in its.
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:05.560]   Well, you're laughing at me, Alex.
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:09.560]   Is that not appropriate to go on Matt and Barry?
[01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:10.560]   Dax?
[01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:12.040]   You mistake my laughter.
[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:13.040]   His name to you, Leo.
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:14.040]   Not at all.
[01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:17.960]   I'm just giggling because people claim that Twitter was operating in a partisan manner
[01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:20.000]   to create a specific narrative.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:24.720]   And then as they accused former Twitter of doing that, they're literally doing that again,
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:27.840]   because you are correct about not Taibbi and Barry Weiss.
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:32.240]   And I find it really funny that Elon says he's like a centrist and wants to advocate
[01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:36.760]   for Ron DeSantis and also to be able to vote Republican in the last election.
[01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:38.040]   He's not moderate.
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:39.280]   He's not center.
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:43.760]   He's even a bit right for even the American political landscape, which is famously right
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:46.080]   leaning already compared to Europe.
[01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:52.160]   And I think the Twitter files have been a flop in terms of driving any meaningful conversation
[01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:53.560]   about moderation.
[01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:58.960]   What they have done is, as Gondia pointed out, create a a fuster clock of people bouncing
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:01.200]   around, shouting and screaming and stamping their feet.
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:05.400]   And essentially anyone who has paid attention to this has just seen people repeat their
[01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:06.880]   priors after it's come out.
[01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:10.600]   So it has moved the ball, zero centimeters forward, and you can even say it's moving
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:11.600]   backwards.
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:16.960]   As David points out with a screenshot among the things released in the Twitter files is
[01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:20.200]   the lives of TikTok, which is notorious and problematic.
[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:28.000]   That's the polite way I put it in your account, which has caused violence against birth control,
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:34.760]   our other abortion clinics and transgender people, has the big banner, "Do not take action
[01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:39.120]   on user without consulting trust and safety."
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:41.720]   They're saying, "Don't ban this."
[01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:43.760]   So it isn't the...
[01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:47.880]   I think the really more important story here, and I really think Devin gets a lot of credit
[01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:54.440]   for writing this, is what it shows you is how hard it is to do moderation at scale with
[01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:57.480]   300 million daily or monthly active users.
[01:05:57.480 --> 01:05:59.920]   But I mean, we're all editors here.
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:04.640]   If a journalist had come to me with this story, I'd be like, "So what's your hook?
[01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:06.920]   What content moderation is hard?"
[01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:12.200]   They blocked the underbiden laptop story from the New York Post for a whole 25 minutes.
[01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:15.520]   Well, yeah, I got approached for the underbiden laptop story and I said, "Fine, show me the
[01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:16.520]   data.
[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:18.760]   It's like we can't show it to you, but you need to publish this in the next two weeks.
[01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:20.440]   You're not going to do that."
[01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:24.880]   You've got to check these things out.
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:26.640]   You've got to understand what's going on.
[01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:33.360]   And it's just like, "Yeah, this was a completely unfounded claim at the time as it turns out.
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:35.160]   I don't know.
[01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:39.160]   But at the time itself, why should you amplify something like that?"
[01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:44.400]   In fact, what are they advocating for as a replacement for this process that we saw,
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:49.040]   which was people trying to take on very complex questions at important times in a difficult
[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:50.040]   moment.
[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:53.680]   Their response to Hatter fixes is, "Let Elon make all the choices himself."
[01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:55.680]   That's why the head of Trust and Safety-
[01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:55.680]   That's not a say-
[01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:57.600]   That's why Yall Roth resigned.
[01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:58.600]   Yall said he's-
[01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:03.720]   And is now being absolutely hounded, which is said, "Elon's really being scathing about
[01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:04.720]   Yall."
[01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:05.720]   He's not being scathing.
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:06.720]   He's inciting violence.
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:07.720]   Yeah.
[01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:08.720]   I mean, I'm sorry, call it what it is.
[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:09.720]   He was happy with Yall.
[01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:11.720]   I know he was supporting him in terms of-
[01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:13.520]   Yeah, but at least as soon as Yall said, "You know what?
[01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:17.640]   I can't- there's no need for trust and safety if one man makes all the decisions, so I'm
[01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:18.640]   leaving."
[01:07:18.640 --> 01:07:21.840]   It wasn't even a mean thing, but it is mean now.
[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:27.400]   I know Elon's fond of Peter Filia references, but I mean, he's literally sat the mob on
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:28.400]   this guy.
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:29.400]   It's ridiculous.
[01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:35.640]   And that's the QAnon side of it, which is this absolutely absurd notion that the Democrats
[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:40.760]   drink the blood of children, and this whole pedophilia thing is pure QAnon.
[01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:50.240]   And it strikes me that Elon has been red-pilled, that he has been swayed onto the dark side,
[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:57.160]   which is a real problem when you have ownership and complete control over such a big platform
[01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:58.800]   as Twitter.
[01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:02.200]   To me, this is the hair on fire problem.
[01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:07.440]   The good news is most, I think by now most people, I've stopped worrying about believing
[01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:08.600]   anything they read.
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:15.560]   And I hope I presume that news accounts no longer, quote, tweets as much as they- I mean,
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:16.560]   it used to be.
[01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:18.400]   That's where they got the leads, right?
[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:20.520]   Is it the same as it changed?
[01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:22.960]   Have you tweaked Twitter differently now?
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:25.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:27.600]   I mean, you see so much-
[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:29.440]   That was a 12-time side.
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:30.440]   Yeah, I know.
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:31.440]   Sorry.
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:33.680]   I mean, you see so much stuff on there.
[01:08:33.680 --> 01:08:35.480]   You've always got to check your sources.
[01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:40.440]   That's what our job is to do, is to check information rather than just spamming it out
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:46.080]   and trying to appeal to the lowest common denominator with whatever the juiciest story
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:47.080]   is.
[01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:53.000]   I don't know how everyone else is, but I've just on Twitter in the last two or three weeks,
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.560]   eight spammers through the roof.
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:09:00.600]   I'm getting a hell of a lot of weird, weird porn in the news stuff.
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:04.320]   And I'm getting tweets from people I have no interest in whatsoever.
[01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:05.800]   I don't know what's going on there.
[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:08.800]   Like I'd say, last job right aside gone feeling.
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:12.080]   I'm curious what Connie thinks, because if you go to Connie's Twitter profile, it notes
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:15.960]   that CNET is the world's number one consumer tech news and advice site.
[01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:19.400]   And I feel like this is a question that we should ask, not from our perspectives, because
[01:09:19.400 --> 01:09:21.040]   we're all way too online.
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:25.200]   But what is CNET saying to the regulars about this stuff?
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:30.520]   Well, so I mean, I've been watching this dumpster fire along with the rest of you.
[01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:33.920]   And there's a couple of observations.
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:39.320]   People follow the people that they want to follow and either you trust them or you don't,
[01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:40.320]   right?
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:47.240]   And I'm seeing the amplification of a lot of other weird bizarre accounts for some back
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:50.320]   and business reason that I don't think any of us have figured out.
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:56.080]   But I also think it's because there has been a small percentage of Twitter users have kind
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:10:01.200]   of disengaged in our doubt now watching the fire rather than participating and burning
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:02.480]   the books.
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:07.480]   And CNET's advice, you know, we've done a timeline of everything that's happening at
[01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:08.480]   CNET.
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:12.000]   And that Twitter, because it's just like it's minute to minute, second by second.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.240]   And it can take over your life here in tech, but in most of America, they don't care.
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:20.360]   They don't care anything about what's happening at Twitter, the average person.
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:24.480]   What they care about is living their life and trying to pay their bills and being able
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:29.040]   to afford Christmas presents if they've just lost their job or what have you.
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:37.880]   And so there is a lot of attention by the media and by, you know, influencers who want
[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:44.640]   to make this an important story because it is just spectacular to watch this man who
[01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:48.040]   claims that he's all about free speech.
[01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:51.560]   And every time I hear him say that, I think of that Princess Bride line.
[01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:56.160]   I don't think that phrasing you can get means because obviously he doesn't know what he's
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:11:00.960]   talking about, so he's just manipulating people and who tweets out misinformation and then
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:03.320]   Twitter itself has to correct his tweets.
[01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:05.160]   How many of those have we seen?
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:14.160]   So I think a lot of the wait and see and the last helicopter is about, can this be salvaged?
[01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:16.240]   What is the, what is going to happen?
[01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:17.240]   Should it be salvaged?
[01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:18.240]   It's just going to input it.
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:19.240]   Should it be salvaged?
[01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:20.680]   Is there value to it that we want to preserve?
[01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:21.680]   Yes.
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:22.680]   My Twitter account.
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:23.680]   I want to preserve that.
[01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:27.440]   You spent good money to get ALEX as your handle.
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:31.000]   Well, no, forget the 60 bucks I paid back in the day.
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.520]   It's the 14 years.
[01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:37.760]   I mean, I have deleted hundreds of thousands of tweets from myself and after my latest
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:39.560]   purge, I'm still like 120k.
[01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:40.560]   I can't help myself.
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:41.560]   I love it.
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:42.560]   It's like a service designed for me.
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:43.560]   Don't take it away.
[01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:44.560]   There is.
[01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:45.560]   Yeah.
[01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:46.560]   There is an endorsement.
[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:47.560]   It is an endorsement thing.
[01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:51.920]   I mean, it's a great thing in itself, but I think conning has a very good point.
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:54.680]   That's what the seventh biggest social network.
[01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:57.880]   It's very popular with journalists, very popular with politicians.
[01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:59.240]   And that's pretty much it.
[01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:00.240]   Yeah.
[01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:02.240]   You know, for your day to day, it's a disproportionate.
[01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:03.240]   Yeah.
[01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:06.880]   But for your day to day operations, most people really don't care that much.
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:07.880]   Yeah.
[01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:09.040]   The real world doesn't.
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:10.040]   Yeah.
[01:12:10.040 --> 01:12:12.320]   But it's just, yeah.
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:13.320]   Except for a while it did.
[01:12:13.320 --> 01:12:18.680]   I mean, you would see the Twitter handle on the voice and, you know, I mean, on TV shows
[01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:21.320]   and I mean, there for a while there, it really did matter.
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:23.400]   It was like, this is how you showed that you were with me.
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:27.880]   I mean, one of my, one of my tweets, this is a shameless self promotion, but one of my
[01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:33.440]   tweets actually appeared on a British comedy show because they were someone from the New
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:38.240]   York Times who was working in London got their house broken into and they were like,
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:40.080]   oh, this is terrible.
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:44.680]   You know, it's like anyone else got an experience as a petty crime that they'd like to share.
[01:12:44.680 --> 01:12:47.000]   And of course, being British, we took the piss.
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.920]   So I just responded, yes, some monster put the milk in before the tea bag.
[01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:54.600]   I called the police, but they were not interested.
[01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:56.840]   Which comedy show were you on?
[01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:59.480]   Oh, this was some British.
[01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:00.480]   That's good.
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:06.960]   I forget the blobs cats or no, no, no, this is some sketch show from the blonde head comic.
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:10.520]   I can't remember his name now.
[01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:12.760]   It's all my Twitter feed as it happens.
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:17.720]   But, well, I just want to add it doesn't Twitter, what happens on Twitter doesn't matter to
[01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:25.320]   a lot of people outside of that bubble except that it does matter in that the media amplifies
[01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:26.520]   what's happening on Twitter.
[01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:32.480]   That's why you saw that during the presidential campaign and you're seeing it now with or we've
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:36.000]   seen it with misinformation about COVID and vaccines.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:43.000]   So it's a pipeline that people then use and then things that should not be amplified are
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.760]   able to be amplified.
[01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:50.440]   And why the former president was so distraught about being kicked off his free megaphone
[01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:58.840]   because the reach and the PR amplification of that service, you know, how I'll do my
[01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:00.400]   good stead and just as a Muslim.
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:02.200]   Trump used Twitter masterfully.
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:04.360]   You agree?
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:10.600]   He used it very effectively and I think that there's going to be the history books will
[01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:17.080]   write many compelling histories and analysis of what went wrong and what misinformation
[01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:21.360]   and disinformation means and what it looked like during this period of time when people
[01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:27.640]   believed all sorts of really crazy things that they, you still question why they believe
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:28.640]   it, right?
[01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:33.560]   But you're also seeing now someone who has claimed that he wants to clean it up and he
[01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:37.760]   just wants the truth to prevail actually in a very short amount of time.
[01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:43.000]   I mean, when did he take over Twitter in October swing from being trying to be this voice of
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.000]   reason to this?
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.160]   Yeah, I don't know what's going on.
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:51.040]   He reminds me of Donald Trump, kind of an attention whore, really.
[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:54.880]   Like, I don't think I don't know if he cares about what he's saying.
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:56.040]   He just likes the attention.
[01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:59.560]   Oh, he's he's post economic in terms of personal wealth.
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:00.800]   So he can do what he likes.
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:04.000]   But I mean, actually, actually, though, can he?
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.200]   I mean, there is some issue with this.
[01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:11.360]   He's got $44 billion sunk into this, not all his money, but he has a at least a billion
[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:13.040]   dollar a year interest payment.
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:15.200]   He's going to have to pay.
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:17.160]   It's hurt Tesla stock significantly.
[01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:18.160]   It's hurt his own.
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:21.320]   He lost $100 billion in net worth in the in the year alone.
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:26.080]   Now, anybody who's got more than a billion dollars in net worth is as to use Bill Gates
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:28.480]   phrase, virtually infinite, wealthy.
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:30.560]   I mean, it's hard to spend that kind of money.
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:33.920]   So the fact that the only aw shucks, he only has $90 billion big deal.
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:36.520]   But it could go worse.
[01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:38.320]   It could continue to struggle.
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:41.040]   Tesla stock could continue to go down.
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:44.360]   I got to say, I mean, if you look at the kind of people that are buying Teslas, they're
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:48.280]   not going to be happy about the way Twitter is going.
[01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:50.280]   It's not doing.
[01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:54.160]   I'll tell you where I'd be unhappy is that he's pulling in all these Tesla engineers
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:59.120]   who by all right should be working on making full self-driving actually work to work on
[01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:00.120]   Twitter.
[01:16:00.120 --> 01:16:02.120]   In fact, there's a lawsuit on that.
[01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:03.960]   There's also a lawsuit on his compensation.
[01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:07.760]   He's paid $56 billion last year by Tesla.
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:11.040]   There's also now he's got three companies to be running.
[01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:15.160]   I mean, there's a clear double standard on this because, you know, oh, I'm just trying
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:18.520]   to open Twitter up and make it available for all voices.
[01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:23.840]   Have you tried going on parlor or GAP or Reddit, Arkansas, or anything like that?
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:29.600]   And if you express anything which is outside of the prescribed line, your Instagram.
[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:30.600]   It's all tribal now.
[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:37.280]   So it's just like, you know, we've got this guy literally, if you can throw $44 billion
[01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:41.920]   at something like this, that's an argument maybe for her taxation.
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:46.600]   I know that's a terrible thing to say, but, you know, maybe people shouldn't have that
[01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:48.480]   much money and be that unstable.
[01:16:48.480 --> 01:16:49.480]   Yeah.
[01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:53.880]   All I'm saying, look, that's all incredibly reasonable and thank you and blah, blah, blah.
[01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:55.080]   But like, let's go back to the whole thing.
[01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:59.520]   Can't spend a billion dollars because I could because I could build my own, but you're
[01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:00.520]   not going to go.
[01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:01.520]   You're not going to be in the poor house.
[01:17:01.520 --> 01:17:04.120]   We make a Brewster's millions with Alex's billions.
[01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:09.560]   Well, as long as we're as long as we're slandering, Elon, let's go through a few of the other
[01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:10.560]   slanders.
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:13.320]   LA Times business section had a big story.
[01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:14.920]   Oh, crud.
[01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:17.880]   Now I have to log in and pay over the pay.
[01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:22.560]   Yeah, having to pay journalists is a really so annoying headline.
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:28.760]   I can still read that Tesla says itself driving technology may be a failure, but it is not
[01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:29.760]   a fraud.
[01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:35.880]   Now, Alex, I did read the story before it locked me out so I can tell you what it said, which
[01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:40.720]   is that he's being sued right now because Tesla has claimed full self-driving.
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:42.120]   In fact, he's opened it up this week.
[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:45.840]   He opened up full self-driving to all Tesla owners.
[01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:50.040]   Very famously, there is something called the painted black video, which is still on the
[01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:57.200]   Tesla site, which I think six years ago was put up on the site as an example of how a Tesla
[01:17:57.200 --> 01:17:59.280]   could drive autonomously.
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:03.600]   It says on the on the video, this is a claim, we're saying, yeah, there's a driver for legal
[01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:04.600]   reasons.
[01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:06.800]   You have to have somebody in the seat, but he's not driving.
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:11.800]   And they showed this video of the Tesla driving blindly all over town.
[01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:16.400]   And later we've learned, and by the way, it's still on the site.
[01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:21.040]   Tesla employees have revealed that the actual video was highly edited.
[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:26.600]   They took out all the driving failures, including one case of the car driving into a fence in
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:29.680]   order to make it look like the car was effectively self-driving.
[01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:37.120]   Elon has been saying for years, he said by 2020, Tesla owners will be able to let full
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:40.280]   self-driving be so good that they'll be able to let other people use their car, basically
[01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:45.960]   start a car sharing service of their own private Uber and make $30,000 a year letting others
[01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:50.440]   use their car autonomously by 2020.
[01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:54.640]   Even today, I just talked to Samable Samad, who's our car guy who took a ride in a full
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:57.640]   self-driving Tesla this week.
[01:18:57.640 --> 01:19:05.360]   He said we had to take over almost constantly to keep the car from doing crazy things.
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:07.120]   It's not a full self-driving vehicle.
[01:19:07.120 --> 01:19:08.720]   Elon has claimed it is.
[01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:10.400]   He's being sued over this.
[01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:16.400]   And his lawyers say, well, it's not fraud that he charged you $5,000 to $15,000 for the
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:18.720]   right to buy.
[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:19.880]   It's not fraud.
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:21.720]   He was just over ambitious.
[01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:33.280]   He was just him saying, kind of like Elizabeth Holmes saying her blood drop testing technology
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:35.920]   would work when it didn't.
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:40.760]   Now, she was, by the way, she and Sonny Balwani are going to jail for many, many years, not
[01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:43.880]   for a failure of vision, but for fraud.
[01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:47.240]   Well, if you still from rich people in America, then yeah.
[01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:48.240]   Oh, there's the key.
[01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:49.880]   Don't steal from George Schultz, sir.
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:50.880]   You're going to jail.
[01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:51.880]   Yeah.
[01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:55.280]   So this, I think, I mean, look, that's their defense.
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:59.200]   Elon was just ambitious, over-lambitious, and it failed.
[01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:00.200]   We couldn't do it.
[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:01.600]   By the way, Elon has not said anything.
[01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:03.400]   Stop selling it as full self-driving.
[01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:04.400]   $15,000.
[01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:05.400]   It's all arguments crap.
[01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:06.400]   Yeah.
[01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:07.400]   It's infuriating.
[01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:08.400]   Sorry, Congress.
[01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:13.840]   I would also say this case is about more than just their claims.
[01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:18.840]   There's a difference between PR and then what you will say in court, right?
[01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:24.160]   The claims that you make from a PR perspective and the claims that you make from in the courtroom,
[01:20:24.160 --> 01:20:26.160]   which you are legally liable to.
[01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:30.880]   But what's interesting about the case is that there's this case because Tesla has forced
[01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:36.360]   people who have had accidents and have been injured because of these self-driving claims.
[01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:39.960]   They're forced into, this is not going to sound sexy, but I just want to say it, into
[01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:40.960]   arbitration.
[01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:41.960]   Yeah.
[01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:43.960]   And then you don't know what happened.
[01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:44.960]   That's actually in the contract.
[01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:45.960]   What happened?
[01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:46.960]   That's in the contract.
[01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:47.960]   You cannot sue.
[01:20:47.960 --> 01:20:52.960]   You know, a lot of what's actually happening and what claims are not, what's PR and what's
[01:20:52.960 --> 01:20:55.880]   reality unless these cases come forward.
[01:20:55.880 --> 01:21:00.600]   And so that is also part of what is so interesting about this moment in time is that's another
[01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:05.280]   example of the company not wanting to have information come to light.
[01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:12.480]   And so somebody who wants to be, oh, so transparent and enable, you know, the man on the street
[01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:17.760]   or what's his term for, you know, the everyday person really has a very strong track record
[01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:20.920]   of quashing anybody trying to criticize or saying anything.
[01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:26.200]   Not just in Tesla when it comes to self-driving, but we've seen in other aspects of the various
[01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:30.200]   businesses because people get fired if they want to say so.
[01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:39.680]   I also should point out that in the four months ending in October, 11 crashed deaths due to
[01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:43.280]   automated tech vehicles, every single one a Tesla.
[01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:44.280]   Yeah.
[01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:49.000]   No, I mean, it's not just move things, but unfortunately it's your drivers.
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:50.000]   You're breaking.
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.000]   It's killing people.
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:57.040]   Actually, the 11th one was a Ford pickup.
[01:21:57.040 --> 01:21:58.560]   It's it's it's deadly.
[01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:03.280]   No, I mean, if you tell somebody, you know, if you sell the whole marketing is that this
[01:22:03.280 --> 01:22:07.160]   is this futuristic system, which is self-driving, isn't it great?
[01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:09.000]   People are going to use it and take the piss.
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.480]   Full self-driving is an unambiguous label.
[01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:12.480]   It's not.
[01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:13.480]   Yeah.
[01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:17.920]   I bought my model X and it had a bio weapon defense system.
[01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:19.960]   It was just a HEPA filter.
[01:22:19.960 --> 01:22:20.960]   That was obvious.
[01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:21.960]   Right.
[01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:27.800]   I didn't drive into, you know, a mustard gas attack with it, but when you see full self-driving
[01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:33.360]   and you pay $15,000 for it, it's reasonable to assume it.
[01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:36.280]   Well, I can take my hands more than that.
[01:22:36.280 --> 01:22:39.560]   I can get in the backseat because it's full self-driving.
[01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:42.640]   Anyway, that's one problem.
[01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:44.920]   There's another case going on.
[01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:48.280]   This time it's federal investigation of Neuralink.
[01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:49.960]   Elon had his Neuralink event.
[01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:50.960]   Oh, God.
[01:22:50.960 --> 01:22:54.600]   I'm going to get some hate for this, but I actually support Neuralink on this one.
[01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:55.600]   Oh, good.
[01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:56.600]   Okay.
[01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:57.600]   Neuralink.
[01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:58.600]   Good.
[01:22:58.600 --> 01:22:59.600]   I'm glad.
[01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:01.600]   So we won't look biased.
[01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:06.920]   Neuralink is Elon's attempt to create a bio interface, human machine interface.
[01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:12.900]   By the way, many exist already far more sophisticated than anything Elon has shown for Peter,
[01:23:12.900 --> 01:23:20.680]   Paraplegix and others, but he is now under federal investigation for animal abuse.
[01:23:20.680 --> 01:23:27.560]   Well, let's, let's, Reuters is reporting that Musk is saying, said at his event that
[01:23:27.560 --> 01:23:30.520]   Neuralink will be ready for human trials in the next six months.
[01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:31.960]   Yeah, but this is a Musk deadline.
[01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:32.960]   So about three years ago.
[01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:36.400]   You might want to get your self-driving vehicle and drive on over to get that.
[01:23:36.400 --> 01:23:39.880]   He's now being investigated by the US Department of Agriculture.
[01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:43.880]   Neuralink has killed 1500 animals during testing since 2018.
[01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:46.200]   It's not merely that they've killed that many animals.
[01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:52.320]   Animals are killed in testing all the time as horrible as that is, but that maybe they
[01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:54.280]   were killed unnecessarily.
[01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:58.880]   Current and former Neuralink employees told Reuters they worked under a constant state
[01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:04.160]   of pressure with Musk repeatedly demanding they work faster and encouraging them to,
[01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:10.680]   quote, imagine they had a bomb strapped to their heads or threatening to trigger a market
[01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:13.960]   failure at the company if they didn't meet his goals.
[01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:18.680]   And this is the, this is the, this is the, this is the, this is the complaint of the USDA.
[01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:23.080]   As a result, animal testing was often rushed, meaning the data sometimes contained errors
[01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:26.880]   in tests that had to be repeated, causing unnecessary deaths.
[01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:30.720]   Other times there were human errors during the surgeries to implant Neuralink chips,
[01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:33.920]   which employs attributed to lack of preparation.
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:38.560]   So it's not merely that they've killed 1500 chimps, but they, that many of them were perhaps
[01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:40.240]   unnecessary defend that.
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:41.240]   Okay.
[01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:43.360]   You don't like chimps.
[01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:44.360]   First off, they weren't chimps.
[01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:45.360]   They were largely McCax.
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:48.680]   Oh, but I mean, I'm glad you know the difference.
[01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:49.680]   Yeah.
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:50.680]   That's good.
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:51.680]   Well, near ancestors.
[01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:53.240]   A McCax is like a monkey though, right?
[01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:54.240]   Yeah.
[01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:59.640]   Look, anybody who's wearing lipstick using shampoo, they've been responsible with a
[01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:06.460]   death of animals and the sound now, if they've rushed it and they've been unnecessarily
[01:25:06.460 --> 01:25:11.840]   causing harm, fine, prosecute them, but I'm sorry, animal testing is a thing, particularly
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:12.840]   for something like this.
[01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:17.000]   And you cannot have it unless you do animal testing and animals are going to die on this
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:18.680]   before you put this in my brain.
[01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:20.240]   I want you to kill a couple of McCax.
[01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:26.080]   Well, look, I mean, NASA deliberately breaks Mites limbs, sends them into space to see
[01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:31.880]   how they react euthanizes them, brings them back down to see how bones will work in zero
[01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:35.160]   gravity will mend in zero gravity.
[01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:39.280]   That's something we definitely need to know if we're going to become a space, a space
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:41.200]   faring civilization.
[01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:45.560]   I'm not reflexly against and against animal testing.
[01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:50.720]   All I'm saying is if you're going to do it, do it efficiently and where you can get software
[01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:51.920]   to go against it.
[01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:56.120]   But I'm sorry for a lot of advances sooner or later some animals are going to have to
[01:25:56.120 --> 01:25:57.120]   die for that.
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:02.880]   Okay, I won't argue that although unnecessary animal testing, we would all agree with you
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:04.600]   on that terrible thing.
[01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:10.240]   And frankly, you can buy all my makeup is not tested on animals because by now they know
[01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:12.120]   yeah, this is going to hurt somebody.
[01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:13.200]   This is not going to hurt somebody.
[01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:17.120]   They don't need to risk an animal's health to test that.
[01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:18.120]   Yeah.
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:20.920]   But I mean, you've got to test medicines on animals.
[01:26:20.920 --> 01:26:26.520]   And it's not entirely effective because different animals have different reactions to medicines
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:29.120]   than humans do, but you do the best you can.
[01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:33.800]   But it's one of its you don't want to see how the sausage is made, but the sausage has
[01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:34.800]   to get made.
[01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:35.800]   All right.
[01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:37.520]   That's my country that makes black pudding.
[01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:38.520]   I mean, come on.
[01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:41.400]   Listen, that's not even sausage, by the way.
[01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:42.400]   Pudding is fantastic.
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:44.760]   I will not hear words that against it.
[01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:46.680]   You know what's even worse than black pudding?
[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:50.280]   White pudding because it's still just as gross.
[01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:56.360]   Look, I'm going to make a distinction between mice and macaques and between lower and higher
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:58.840]   primates in terms of a level of intelligence.
[01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:00.320]   I think this does matter.
[01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:04.000]   And when you are dealing with increasingly intelligent creatures that are increasingly
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:07.920]   human like in their ability to have emotions and language and so forth, you have to have
[01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:08.920]   higher standards.
[01:27:08.920 --> 01:27:13.760]   And so to me, I think you can say all you want to say about the importance for limited
[01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:19.400]   animal testing as a species, sure, but given what we hear in this case and the sheer number
[01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:22.840]   of deaths, it's to the point in which I actually do care.
[01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:28.600]   And I try to keep a lower bar that I might otherwise so I can engage in the modern world.
[01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:32.040]   But this seemed to be highly abusive and unnecessary and necessary.
[01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:33.040]   Unnecessary the key.
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:34.040]   Yeah.
[01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:35.040]   It's bad.
[01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:36.040]   Yeah.
[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:37.720]   No, I mean, it has to be necessary.
[01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:42.440]   But at the same time, you know, I mean, I don't know if anyone here is a vegetarian, but
[01:27:42.440 --> 01:27:46.760]   you know, it's not great in a slaughterhouse either, but you know, that's the food.
[01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:47.760]   I agree.
[01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:53.160]   I mean, I'm going to go back to yeah, like, I mean, we can sit here and say factory farming
[01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:54.160]   is bad.
[01:27:54.160 --> 01:28:00.000]   And the way we process chickens is ridiculously evil and the Elon Musk shouldn't be killing
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.640]   monkeys and that, yes, some of them animal testing is fine.
[01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:04.040]   You can have all of those at the same time.
[01:28:04.040 --> 01:28:05.040]   They're not contradictory.
[01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:06.040]   Absolutely.
[01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:11.440]   And I'm going to just throw in some there really excited about brain computer interfaces.
[01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:16.920]   I don't want them to be brought to the market on the back of a unnecessary string of dead
[01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:17.920]   animals.
[01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:20.240]   I just want them to work.
[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:26.480]   And I suppose that the ones that are being used now, for instance, for a paraplegic to
[01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:31.560]   be able to type with their brain or to move limbs, I suppose those probably were tested
[01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:32.560]   on animals.
[01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:33.560]   Yeah.
[01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:34.560]   They were tested on humans.
[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:40.040]   I'm kind of kind of iffy about that argument because we've had legitimate scientific research
[01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:43.880]   doing this for 10 years and working towards it.
[01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:48.480]   What I worry is Elon Musk is going to get in there and say, "Who cares about that?
[01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:49.480]   Just get it done fast."
[01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:50.880]   And that's what it looks like.
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:51.880]   They did with Tesla.
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:52.880]   You know what I mean?
[01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:53.880]   That's what it looks like.
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:54.880]   Yeah.
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:57.680]   It's amazing how much we have to talk about Elon Musk on a day to day basis.
[01:28:57.680 --> 01:28:58.800]   I'm really tired of the thing.
[01:28:58.800 --> 01:29:00.720]   I am so tired of it too.
[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:03.840]   I feel like we kind of can't just ignore it either, though, right?
[01:29:03.840 --> 01:29:05.000]   No, no, we're stuck.
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.160]   I mean, like this is the correct- That's what he wanted.
[01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:08.560]   Run down of articles, talk about that.
[01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:11.560]   I was actually very impressed with the Twit staff who put together today's agenda.
[01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:14.600]   I was just bummed out that one dude is so essential to it.
[01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:17.800]   I mean, I thought the point of capitalism was to engineer a competition, not foam on
[01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:20.080]   our accident on top of a pile of wealth.
[01:29:20.080 --> 01:29:21.080]   Oh, but come on.
[01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:22.080]   This is America.
[01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:23.800]   You've given up on competition years ago.
[01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:25.120]   Do you opt to lean monopoly?
[01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:26.280]   That's where the profit goes.
[01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:28.920]   So, you know- This is why I was in favor of leaner con.
[01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:30.080]   Take it over at the FTC.
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:31.080]   I am with you totally.
[01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:33.000]   I think you should be great.
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.000]   Yeah.
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.720]   Let's get some decent competition in here.
[01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:36.960]   Let's get a mobile service.
[01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:39.280]   Bring back Windows phone.
[01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:40.280]   So did you- Yeah, that's good.
[01:29:40.280 --> 01:29:41.280]   You weren't too far, Alex.
[01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:43.640]   The Harry and Meghan show.
[01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:49.320]   I knew this was going to come up and so yes, I wasted an hour of my life watching the first
[01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:50.320]   episode of Harry and Meghan.
[01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:51.960]   Yesterday said Ian's going to be on.
[01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:53.840]   We have to watch this thing.
[01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:56.080]   It's just- Okay.
[01:29:56.080 --> 01:29:59.840]   It's not fished, bitingly bad, but it's just bad.
[01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:00.840]   It's just fun.
[01:30:00.840 --> 01:30:03.760]   It's just an infomercial for, you know, at home with a sausage.
[01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:05.960]   But you know, they're really in love, you can tell.
[01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:08.640]   You can tell they're in love, certainly.
[01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:09.640]   It does.
[01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:11.320]   They made a point of saying that many times.
[01:30:11.320 --> 01:30:12.320]   Many, many.
[01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:17.040]   In fact, if I hear Harry say I have to protect my family one more time, I swear I'm just
[01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:18.400]   kind of just, you know.
[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:22.160]   I know you're- I know you loved the Queen and we all loved the Queen.
[01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:25.640]   But she did a lousy job very well.
[01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:29.360]   Isn't it time just to get rid of this whole waste of money?
[01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:30.360]   Yes.
[01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:32.520]   And actually, we make a profit out of the royal family.
[01:30:32.520 --> 01:30:33.520]   We make a significant profit.
[01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:34.920]   That's not an excuse for her.
[01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:35.920]   No.
[01:30:35.920 --> 01:30:36.920]   What I hate about the royal family-
[01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:39.720]   It makes a profit, the royal family makes a profit.
[01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:41.320]   They do pretty well.
[01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:46.560]   Well, Charles O'en's call me all that really helps, you know.
[01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:49.640]   But you know, I mean, it feels very medieval.
[01:30:49.640 --> 01:30:51.680]   It is totally medieval.
[01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:56.120]   And it props up a class system which is totally logically unsupportable.
[01:30:56.120 --> 01:31:00.680]   I mean, the very idea of choosing the head of the state, the head of the armed forces
[01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:06.400]   and the head of the established church out of a womb lottery is just bonkers.
[01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:09.000]   It makes no sense whatsoever logically.
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:10.800]   But-
[01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:12.200]   It's not about logic.
[01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:13.200]   It's about-
[01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:16.400]   No, but I mean, all credits are Harry for getting out of the fur.
[01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:19.160]   I think his mother would have been proud of him for doing that.
[01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:20.160]   Really?
[01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:21.160]   Yeah.
[01:31:21.160 --> 01:31:23.120]   I don't think she was proud when he did it.
[01:31:23.120 --> 01:31:24.120]   What?
[01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:25.120]   Diana Bush, he was dead.
[01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:26.120]   Oh, his mother.
[01:31:26.120 --> 01:31:27.120]   Sorry, yeah.
[01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:28.120]   No, no, no, his grandmother.
[01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:29.120]   No.
[01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:30.120]   Diana.
[01:31:30.120 --> 01:31:32.960]   But Diana, so if you're watching The Crown-
[01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:36.240]   And who isn't?
[01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:39.320]   Diana's being portrayed as kind of a nut.
[01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:41.320]   Ah, she was-
[01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:43.360]   Was she a nut?
[01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:44.920]   You never really know because-
[01:31:44.920 --> 01:31:46.160]   Yeah, this is all done through the-
[01:31:46.160 --> 01:31:49.400]   I feel like it would be a horrible life to be every time you heard.
[01:31:49.400 --> 01:31:50.400]   Oh, it was-
[01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:52.360]   I mean, surrounded by paparazzi.
[01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:54.240]   That's what killed her in the long run.
[01:31:54.240 --> 01:31:55.240]   Well-
[01:31:55.240 --> 01:31:56.240]   And there's-
[01:31:56.240 --> 01:31:57.800]   Not wearing a seatbelt had something to do with it.
[01:31:57.800 --> 01:32:00.400]   Yeah, but they were fleeing from the paparazzi and-
[01:32:00.400 --> 01:32:01.880]   Look, four people were in the car.
[01:32:01.880 --> 01:32:02.880]   One person survived.
[01:32:02.880 --> 01:32:04.600]   The one person was wearing a seatbelt.
[01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:07.640]   You know, it's kind of like- it's Occam's eraser.
[01:32:07.640 --> 01:32:10.980]   The Crown- estates make 300 million a year for the government.
[01:32:10.980 --> 01:32:11.980]   Yeah.
[01:32:11.980 --> 01:32:14.460]   And then they give 10% back to the king to run the estates.
[01:32:14.460 --> 01:32:15.460]   Exactly.
[01:32:15.460 --> 01:32:16.460]   We make a profit out of them.
[01:32:16.460 --> 01:32:17.760]   Plus there's a tourism angle.
[01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:19.260]   And everyone likes seeing the people in the-
[01:32:19.260 --> 01:32:20.260]   Oh, isn't it?
[01:32:20.260 --> 01:32:21.260]   The big and weird thing.
[01:32:21.260 --> 01:32:24.080]   I went to fucking Natales and watched the changing of the god.
[01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:25.760]   Yes, but here's the question I have.
[01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:28.680]   Why are Americans so obsessed with British royalty?
[01:32:28.680 --> 01:32:32.640]   We literally told them to go F off back in the day and had to fight a war to get them
[01:32:32.640 --> 01:32:33.640]   to go away.
[01:32:33.640 --> 01:32:35.640]   And now we are keeping the entire-
[01:32:35.640 --> 01:32:36.640]   Here's the thing I got-
[01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:37.640]   Here's the thing I got-
[01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:38.640]   But keep it coming.
[01:32:38.640 --> 01:32:39.920]   You're becoming like us.
[01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:40.920]   No.
[01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:46.480]   Because Queen Elizabeth did a bad job with such grace and charm and-
[01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:48.040]   Yeah, she was great.
[01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:49.040]   She was great.
[01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:52.800]   It really was had on heart.
[01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:58.280]   She was given a pass, but Charles is turning out to be a little bit of just kind of an
[01:32:58.280 --> 01:32:59.280]   upper class twin.
[01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:00.280]   To be expected.
[01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:03.600]   No, I was going to say, I mean, he's the idiot son.
[01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:05.080]   But I mean, before Americans' Christmas-
[01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:09.240]   So I feel like the royal family isn't going to have the-
[01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:10.240]   The gravitas.
[01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:15.240]   And the distance that they were given, the permission they were given, thanks to the grace
[01:33:15.240 --> 01:33:19.080]   of the Queen, I think people are not going to give them that-
[01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:24.360]   With my worries that Charles has plans to try and rule rather than just be the figure
[01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:25.360]   that he's supposed to really-
[01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:26.360]   No.
[01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:31.120]   Well, he's been writing letters to- I mean, the royal family has the ability to kill legislation
[01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:32.120]   which affects them personally.
[01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:34.120]   They're not supposed to ever do.
[01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:35.480]   No, they do it a fair bit in fact.
[01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:36.480]   Oh, really?
[01:33:36.480 --> 01:33:37.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:39.760]   I mean, it's like taxes on certain things and that sort of thing.
[01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:41.680]   They will just like, yeah, we're taking that out.
[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:42.680]   That's very anti-democratic.
[01:33:42.680 --> 01:33:45.400]   Yeah, but I had the House of Lords.
[01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:46.400]   Yeah.
[01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:47.400]   There's some work to do.
[01:33:47.400 --> 01:33:48.400]   Yeah, okay.
[01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:51.600]   But Alex, before we start criticizing, remember GW Bush?
[01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:56.480]   It's not, you know, when you've got the idiot son of a former leader who gets the job basically
[01:33:56.480 --> 01:34:00.200]   by birth, you know, it's not that different from the royal family.
[01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:02.280]   They just call it something different.
[01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:04.840]   So I haven't watched Harry and Meghan.
[01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:05.840]   I'm sorry.
[01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:07.960]   I was an extraordinary attorney woo.
[01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:09.040]   That's what I watched on Netflix.
[01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:11.000]   That's much better, yeah, yeah.
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:17.600]   But I gave them credit for capitalizing on their celebrity and not having just other
[01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:18.800]   people capitalize on it.
[01:34:18.800 --> 01:34:21.160]   That's a very American to do, yeah.
[01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:23.560]   Yes, they live in California now, right?
[01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:26.040]   And what would they pay at $100 million or something?
[01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:28.040]   I mean, they're somehow reaching around my wife.
[01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:29.040]   I'll be fine, yeah.
[01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:30.040]   What?
[01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:31.040]   Well, what's he going to do?
[01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:32.800]   I mean, it's like, you can't get a job.
[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:34.600]   He's not the smartest tool in the box.
[01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:35.920]   Play a helicopter.
[01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:38.840]   No, he acted as gunner on the helicopter.
[01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:39.840]   Okay.
[01:34:39.840 --> 01:34:41.400]   Yes, he can shoot out of a helicopter.
[01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:42.400]   That's not really a lot.
[01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:43.880]   He's got the same job.
[01:34:43.880 --> 01:34:45.880]   Now, it's basically.
[01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:46.880]   Whoa.
[01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:49.800]   Did you see his tweet by the way yesterday?
[01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:51.320]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:34:51.320 --> 01:34:52.320]   No, no, no.
[01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:53.320]   That's not going to there.
[01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:54.320]   Okay, fair enough.
[01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:55.320]   No, he's.
[01:34:55.320 --> 01:34:56.320]   I'm going to check out this.
[01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:58.320]   Fair play to them.
[01:34:58.320 --> 01:35:04.440]   But, you know, and I'm glad they're out of it because it's a horrible system.
[01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:09.040]   And for all the fresh prints of LA jokes, which will being made in the British media
[01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:14.560]   has gone nuts over this over the last week and a half because they're basically saying,
[01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:19.920]   you know, the paparazzi and the British tabloid media were racist against my wife, which they
[01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:21.800]   quite clearly were.
[01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:22.800]   Were?
[01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:23.800]   Yes.
[01:35:23.800 --> 01:35:24.800]   Absolutely.
[01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:26.960]   Although she is the whitest black woman I've ever seen.
[01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:29.560]   I don't care.
[01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:35.760]   It's just some of the stuff that was coming out was Danny Baker, a BBC Radio 5 presenter,
[01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:40.160]   actually, thank God got fired because he printed out a new picture of the royal baby
[01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:41.400]   with a picture of a monkey.
[01:35:41.400 --> 01:35:42.640]   Oh my God.
[01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:47.200]   You know, it's just the blatant racism.
[01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:48.640]   It's still there.
[01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:51.840]   Some lady in waiting asked, oh yeah.
[01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:53.600]   Did you see this?
[01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:57.640]   Her response was so, sorry, go on.
[01:35:57.640 --> 01:35:59.400]   I'm trying to remember who it was.
[01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:01.040]   It was a black member of parliament or?
[01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:02.040]   No, no.
[01:36:02.040 --> 01:36:03.760]   She runs a non-profit in the UK.
[01:36:03.760 --> 01:36:04.760]   She was an NGO.
[01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:06.800]   She was at a reception at the palace.
[01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:07.800]   Yeah.
[01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:09.560]   And one of the, we don't know who, but we think no.
[01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:10.560]   I know she's resigned.
[01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:11.560]   She resigns.
[01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:15.280]   We know who said, well, what is your nationality, dear?
[01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:17.280]   She says, I'm born, I was born in Manchester.
[01:36:17.280 --> 01:36:18.280]   I'm English.
[01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:20.240]   No, no, no, I don't mean that.
[01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:22.080]   You're obviously not English.
[01:36:22.080 --> 01:36:24.880]   Well, you're people from.
[01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:26.680]   Her response was fantastic, though.
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:28.160]   It's like, I don't know.
[01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:30.440]   They didn't keep records when they brought me overhead.
[01:36:30.440 --> 01:36:32.440]   Oh, burns.
[01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:34.440]   Wow.
[01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:35.600]   Times are changing, right?
[01:36:35.600 --> 01:36:39.960]   I mean, this kind of behavior, it's kind of anathema, though.
[01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:45.440]   And I feel like the royal family kind of is protecting that somewhat, you know?
[01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:47.080]   A rotatory monarchy is bad.
[01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:48.080]   It's bad.
[01:36:48.080 --> 01:36:49.080]   Yeah.
[01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:51.280]   But it's good for Netflix's business making a tech story.
[01:36:51.280 --> 01:36:52.280]   And I will--
[01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:53.280]   Good for the British.
[01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:54.280]   Yeah, British.
[01:36:54.280 --> 01:36:55.280]   Treasury.
[01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:57.520]   Although what I'll say is, if you want to have some fun, you can just watch the show
[01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:01.400]   Wednesday, which is lovely and delightful, and does not involve any royal figures whatsoever.
[01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:04.400]   And you don't have to deal with Tories on Twitter telling you that Meghan Merkel is a
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:06.880]   bad person because I don't care what they think.
[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:09.800]   And I'll just say this, I hate celebrity culture.
[01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:11.360]   And the monarchy is the epitome of--
[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:12.360]   It's the worst.
[01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:15.560]   And it's because they're not even pretty or smart or talented.
[01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:16.560]   No.
[01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:17.560]   They're just there.
[01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:18.560]   They're that by class.
[01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:19.560]   They just showed up.
[01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:20.560]   Yeah.
[01:37:20.560 --> 01:37:21.560]   Let's take a break now, shall we?
[01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:23.560]   At least celebrities are hot.
[01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:24.560]   All right.
[01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:25.560]   Wow.
[01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:26.560]   Oh, good.
[01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:29.560]   I thought that was a relatively PG comment.
[01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:30.960]   I'm calling is giving me a look.
[01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:32.720]   All right, I'll take it back.
[01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:35.360]   I endorse your endorsement of Wednesday, Adams.
[01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:36.360]   That was a fun series.
[01:37:36.360 --> 01:37:37.360]   Yeah, that's a good show.
[01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:38.360]   Yeah.
[01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:39.360]   Lovely.
[01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:40.360]   I'm going to stop there.
[01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:43.120]   Did you see the behind the scenes of Thing?
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:44.120]   The Hands?
[01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:45.120]   The character actor who had to do--
[01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:46.120]   Yeah.
[01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:47.120]   And he's a great suit.
[01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:50.120]   And then his hand, so they can mad him out.
[01:37:50.120 --> 01:37:51.120]   No, good, great.
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:52.120]   And he's like a dancer.
[01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:54.440]   I mean, he's like, really, it's quite impressive what he's doing.
[01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:59.760]   And if you want more innovation, Guillermo del Toro put up his version of Pinocchio.
[01:37:59.760 --> 01:38:00.760]   Oh, is that good?
[01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:02.480]   Have you seen it?
[01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:03.840]   It's not a kid's Pinocchio.
[01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:04.840]   Mussolini, Euler.
[01:38:04.840 --> 01:38:05.840]   Well, as you know, Pinocchio--
[01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:08.600]   That's the puppet at one point.
[01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:09.600]   Yeah.
[01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:10.600]   Yeah.
[01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:14.280]   No, as you know, Pinocchio was, in fact, a fascist novel.
[01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:16.240]   No, it was pre-fasched.
[01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:17.240]   Pre-fasched.
[01:38:17.240 --> 01:38:24.760]   But 1880 something, but stop motion and what he's trying to do technically, the story.
[01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:26.480]   So did he tell the original style Pinocchio?
[01:38:26.480 --> 01:38:28.120]   Did he tell the original style Pinocchio?
[01:38:28.120 --> 01:38:29.120]   Not the Disney Pinocchio.
[01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:31.280]   Oh, it's not Disney Pinocchio.
[01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:32.280]   This is not kids.
[01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:33.280]   Do not have your kids.
[01:38:33.280 --> 01:38:34.280]   Watch this Pinocchio.
[01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:39.920]   Unless they're older and you have a very long conversation with them about death and
[01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:41.960]   fascism and loss.
[01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:42.960]   Yeah.
[01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:48.920]   It isn't remarkable how many children's fairy tales have really, really dark stuff if you
[01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:52.880]   look at the original versions, rather than the Disney-fied versions of it.
[01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:57.680]   You know, it's like Cinderella, her sisters cut their toes off to try and get their, you
[01:38:57.680 --> 01:39:03.440]   know, their feet into the slipper and little red riding hood is just don't read the original
[01:39:03.440 --> 01:39:04.440]   to the kids.
[01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:06.720]   It's just really don't.
[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:08.240]   It's fairly dark.
[01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:11.120]   No, no, no, I want to go home.
[01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:12.120]   Screw the forums.
[01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:14.840]   Now I'm a pretty grim well played.
[01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:16.840]   The grim well played.
[01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:17.840]   Yeah.
[01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:18.840]   Yeah.
[01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:20.000]   All right, let's take a little break.
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:21.800]   We will come back with lots more.
[01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:23.960]   I want to talk about China a little bit.
[01:39:23.960 --> 01:39:30.040]   TSMC planning now to triple its investment in Arizona.
[01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:35.600]   Apple, you know, telling the Wall Street Journal, you can't, you can't attribute this to Apple,
[01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:37.640]   but we're going to get out of there.
[01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:44.200]   And now China is actually responding by scrapping its COVID zero policy, which is very interesting.
[01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:45.920]   Well, that's all coming up in just a little bit.
[01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:49.880]   And then we have lots of lots of lovely little fun stories to tell you.
[01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:53.520]   But first this weekend tech is brought to you by Zipprecruiter.
[01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:54.520]   It's the holiday season.
[01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:57.320]   Have you noticed Santa threw up on our studio?
[01:39:57.320 --> 01:39:58.880]   That's for sure.
[01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:02.000]   Many businesses hiring for festive jobs.
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:04.720]   These are actual listings from Zipprecruiter.
[01:40:04.720 --> 01:40:11.080]   Turkey catcher, bilingual Santa Claus.
[01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:16.920]   Okay, that I get coffee and nut gift basket assembler.
[01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:23.120]   And there is literally a listing on Zipprecruiter for reindeer Wrangler.
[01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:25.520]   This is the beauty of Zipprecruiter.
[01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:28.480]   It can fill any job, any job.
[01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:30.080]   What roles can't they fill?
[01:40:30.080 --> 01:40:33.480]   If you're hiring Zipprecruiter is there to help you find your dream candidates, what
[01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:38.280]   we use to hire, we have been using for years to hire and it really works beautifully.
[01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:42.600]   So the first part of course is that when you post on Zipprecruiter, you're not just posting
[01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:43.920]   a Zipprecruiter.
[01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:47.320]   Lots of lots of job hunters go there, but you're also posting on a hundred other job
[01:40:47.320 --> 01:40:50.480]   boards plus social networks.
[01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:52.800]   You're really putting out casting the widest net.
[01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:58.920]   And then the beauty of this is all of those applicants don't go to your email or your phone.
[01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:01.160]   No, no, no, that would be horrific.
[01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:07.200]   They go into your Zipprecruiter inbox, which has all these tools for filtering, scanning,
[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:10.520]   the friends, they reformat all the resumes so that makes it easy to read.
[01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:16.440]   They give you questions to eliminate people who are just not starters.
[01:41:16.440 --> 01:41:23.800]   Yes, no, true, false, multiple choice, even essay questions so you can strain out the
[01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:25.640]   candidates that don't fit.
[01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:27.360]   But then they do something really cool.
[01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:29.320]   People come to Zipprecruiter looking for work.
[01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:34.720]   They go through those resumes with the software and look for people whose qualifications match
[01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:36.680]   your requirements.
[01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:37.680]   That's all.
[01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:40.520]   Then they give you a list of those people and you can look at them and say, "Oh, I like
[01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:41.520]   this one.
[01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:42.760]   I like this one," and ask them to apply.
[01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:47.160]   I have to say our experience has been when you invite somebody to apply to your job, there's
[01:41:47.160 --> 01:41:48.160]   something about it.
[01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:52.040]   I mean, they feel honored, flatter that you were interested in.
[01:41:52.040 --> 01:41:55.400]   So they're much more likely to show up, do the interview.
[01:41:55.400 --> 01:41:57.960]   It's really fantastic.
[01:41:57.960 --> 01:42:01.040]   All of this, in fact, our experience has been you post on Zipprecruiter, we're going to
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:08.640]   get within a few hours, at least three or four really qualified candidates, four out
[01:42:08.640 --> 01:42:15.000]   of five employers, 80% report that they'll get a quality candidate within the first day.
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:18.040]   Within the first day, it really, really works.
[01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:19.280]   We love Zipprecruiter.
[01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:20.280]   You will too.
[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:23.080]   Let Zipprecruiter help you find qualified candidates fast.
[01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:33.600]   You can try it for free, zipprecruiter.com/twitziprecruiter.com/twit.
[01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:35.520]   They're fantastic.
[01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:39.080]   Thank you, Zipprecruiter, for your support and for helping us find such great people
[01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:40.080]   like Ava.
[01:42:40.080 --> 01:42:41.080]   Aviva.
[01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:43.120]   I was calling Ava Viva and others.
[01:42:43.120 --> 01:42:44.760]   Thank you, Zipp, Zipp.
[01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:51.960]   So it's funny we were talking about this last week.
[01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:55.560]   The Wall Street Journal publishes a story saying, "Yeah, Apple's thinking of getting
[01:42:55.560 --> 01:42:56.560]   out of China.
[01:42:56.560 --> 01:42:58.280]   They're moving faster to get out China."
[01:42:58.280 --> 01:43:00.280]   And somebody I can't remember who was, maybe it was Jason Sells.
[01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:04.520]   I said, "Okay, this is a really good example of how Apple will go to the Wall Street Journal
[01:43:04.520 --> 01:43:08.000]   and say, "No, you can't attribute it to us, but we think you should write a story.
[01:43:08.000 --> 01:43:10.640]   We would like you to write a story."
[01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:12.200]   They get that kind of insight.
[01:43:12.200 --> 01:43:15.480]   I think somebody said this is exactly what happened there.
[01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:17.720]   Nevertheless, I think Apple's trying to send signals.
[01:43:17.720 --> 01:43:20.440]   Yeah, we understand it's problematic.
[01:43:20.440 --> 01:43:28.320]   iPhone production down 40% this month because of riots, anti-COVID-zero policy riots, riots
[01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:31.200]   at the Foxconn iPhone factory.
[01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:32.440]   They call it iPhone City.
[01:43:32.440 --> 01:43:38.440]   300,000 people worked there building your iPhone and they're unhappy.
[01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:39.440]   I don't blame them.
[01:43:39.440 --> 01:43:41.640]   They're rioting on the right thing.
[01:43:41.640 --> 01:43:45.520]   For a couple of reasons, one, the COVID policy, but two, they weren't given the bonus they
[01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:47.440]   were promised.
[01:43:47.440 --> 01:43:52.720]   The Chinese Communist Party is going to veterans and others saying, "Can you go work at this
[01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:53.720]   factory?
[01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:54.880]   We need to keep the production going."
[01:43:54.880 --> 01:43:58.920]   The China understands this production is very important to their economy as important
[01:43:58.920 --> 01:44:02.840]   to their economy as to Apple's.
[01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:10.080]   There were lots of protests and now, President Xi has announced they are dropping their COVID
[01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:16.720]   testing, quarantine requirements, a big pivot.
[01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:17.720]   Victory?
[01:44:17.720 --> 01:44:20.240]   Is that victory for the Chinese protesters?
[01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:22.240]   I guess it is.
[01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:28.640]   Well, I mean, part of the reason for the anger over this is that there was fire in an apartment
[01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:30.640]   building where people were locked in.
[01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:33.920]   They were welded into the building.
[01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:35.400]   Yeah.
[01:44:35.400 --> 01:44:36.400]   I don't know.
[01:44:36.400 --> 01:44:39.560]   I've heard so many wild stories coming out of China over the last year.
[01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:41.120]   I don't know what to believe on it.
[01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:47.720]   Yes, I think to be honest, on-shoring production of chips and the rest of it, that's an absolutely
[01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:49.440]   essential thing.
[01:44:49.440 --> 01:44:55.920]   We've become far too dependent on a very few number of manufacturers and both from a human
[01:44:55.920 --> 01:45:00.600]   rights economics and national security basis, that needs to stop and that needs to, we need
[01:45:00.600 --> 01:45:02.440]   to on-shore the stuff.
[01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:05.280]   TSMC, the Taiwan semiconductor manufacturer.
[01:45:05.280 --> 01:45:07.240]   Oh, that gets me so angry.
[01:45:07.240 --> 01:45:08.240]   What?
[01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:12.080]   The building in Arizona, the most water-stressed state in the United States.
[01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:13.520]   Oh, and it does use a lot of water, I'm sure.
[01:45:13.520 --> 01:45:17.480]   And they're building two huge fabs there in Teles Building in a minute because they're
[01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:18.920]   getting tax breaks for it.
[01:45:18.920 --> 01:45:21.200]   But where's the water going to come from?
[01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:23.680]   Well, we know where the money's coming from, the chips act.
[01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:25.160]   A lot of it's coming from the kids.
[01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:26.880]   Yeah, I mean, taxpayers.
[01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:27.880]   But that is good.
[01:45:27.880 --> 01:45:28.880]   I think it's good.
[01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:33.800]   It's important for America that we take this, some of this manufacturer home.
[01:45:33.800 --> 01:45:35.840]   We're never going to take the assembly home.
[01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:36.840]   I mean, imagine.
[01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:43.840]   Where would you put a factory with 300,000 workers getting paid minimum wage to assemble
[01:45:43.840 --> 01:45:44.840]   iPhones?
[01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:46.480]   There's nowhere in the United States you could do that.
[01:45:46.480 --> 01:45:50.280]   So this is a story of someone who was an Apple reporter for a very long time at Bloomberg
[01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:52.560]   and Forbes.
[01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:55.040]   Don't put all your iPhones in one basket, right?
[01:45:55.040 --> 01:45:59.760]   Apple moved all of its manufacturing, as did by the way, a lot of the other consumer electronics
[01:45:59.760 --> 01:46:03.360]   companies to Asia because of the war of cheap labor.
[01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:06.600]   Do you remember back in 2016, 2017?
[01:46:06.600 --> 01:46:08.320]   Can't remember, maybe 2015?
[01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:10.840]   All of those suicides at these factors.
[01:46:10.840 --> 01:46:11.840]   Right, yeah.
[01:46:11.840 --> 01:46:15.360]   They put a net to catch people jumping out of windows.
[01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:17.200]   Because the working conditions were so badly.
[01:46:17.200 --> 01:46:22.560]   So this is just more an evolution of the working conditions in places where you're trying
[01:46:22.560 --> 01:46:24.800]   to exploit cheap labor.
[01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:28.440]   It's coupled with the fact that we just went through the pandemic, which exposed the problem
[01:46:28.440 --> 01:46:32.480]   of having the supply chain all outside the US.
[01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:38.920]   And companies like Apple have an under Tim Koch, who is by the way, the cheap operating
[01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:44.400]   officer who moved a lot of their facilities there to maximize their profits, now recognizing
[01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:46.640]   that you can't have it all in one place.
[01:46:46.640 --> 01:46:50.200]   You know, whether or not it's in Arizona or some other state, we do need to bring some
[01:46:50.200 --> 01:46:51.200]   of that back.
[01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:55.320]   Not all of it will come back because there are many other countries where that labor can
[01:46:55.320 --> 01:46:56.320]   be exploited.
[01:46:56.320 --> 01:46:58.640]   Vietnam, Brazil, India, India.
[01:46:58.640 --> 01:47:00.600]   Advantage, or what have you, if you will.
[01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:03.040]   But it's about diversifying that.
[01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:09.960]   And right now, China, for a variety of reasons, is not a popular country for American businesses
[01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:11.520]   to want to do business with.
[01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:14.000]   And this is just another example.
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:18.120]   Apple certainly has the cash to do whatever they want in terms of where they want to set
[01:47:18.120 --> 01:47:21.640]   up production, where they want to set up manufacturing.
[01:47:21.640 --> 01:47:22.920]   How long does that take?
[01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:23.920]   Right?
[01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:27.880]   They've actually did a lot, not just in outsourcing the manufacturing there, but they've actually
[01:47:27.880 --> 01:47:34.440]   set up supply chains and systems to make sure that they get priority building those factory
[01:47:34.440 --> 01:47:35.440]   lines.
[01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:38.480]   They put a lot of cash overseas to set those up.
[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:45.320]   And so they're not going to 100% detangle from that, but it is the start of diversifying.
[01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:49.520]   Not just, I think, for Apple, but for a lot of other companies who are caught short because
[01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:54.920]   of you can't have everything in one place, or if a tsunami hits or an earthquake hit
[01:47:54.920 --> 01:47:58.000]   or a pandemic hits, then you're out of luck.
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:01.760]   Well, also, Taiwan is going to fall to China at some point.
[01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:04.200]   That's really, you think that's a given?
[01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:05.200]   No, that's a given.
[01:48:05.200 --> 01:48:06.200]   It's like a whole call.
[01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:07.360]   They're coming for it.
[01:48:07.360 --> 01:48:09.080]   And there's, quite frankly, nothing anyone can do about it.
[01:48:09.080 --> 01:48:11.680]   Much like Hong Kong, where you take a while.
[01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:17.600]   I mean, Hong Kong, we agreed to hand it over, and they promised to make sure that it stayed
[01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:20.080]   in democracy, and we've seen how that worked.
[01:48:20.080 --> 01:48:23.920]   Taiwan, there's nothing anyone can do.
[01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:25.080]   America can't defend Taiwan.
[01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:26.880]   You think it's a mistake?
[01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:28.720]   Biden said we will defend Taiwan.
[01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:30.280]   You think it's a mistake?
[01:48:30.280 --> 01:48:31.280]   Seriously.
[01:48:31.280 --> 01:48:34.160]   The first time you send a couple of aircraft carriers that way in a war situation, they're
[01:48:34.160 --> 01:48:35.160]   going to get sunk.
[01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:36.160]   Yeah.
[01:48:36.160 --> 01:48:37.160]   And Americans won't stand for it.
[01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:42.440]   Well, China's been preparing for this for the last 20 years, whereas we're still fighting
[01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:44.600]   wars from 30 years ago.
[01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:51.920]   So, but I mean, in terms of Apple coming back to that point, Apple put a lot of pressure
[01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:58.480]   on TSMC to actually do more advanced chips at this Arizona plant, because originally
[01:48:58.480 --> 01:49:05.320]   they were going to do high-an-animeter processes, and now they're just saying, no, we need the
[01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:07.160]   newer stuff over here, please.
[01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:10.960]   So it is, as Connie said, about supply chain.
[01:49:10.960 --> 01:49:12.680]   But just Arizona.
[01:49:12.680 --> 01:49:18.560]   Seriously, put it in Maine, put it in Vermont, put it somewhere with your water in it.
[01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:20.520]   You know what we have a lot of in Rhode Island?
[01:49:20.520 --> 01:49:21.520]   What's that?
[01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:22.520]   A lot of water here.
[01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:23.520]   A lot of water.
[01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:25.200]   Like two thirds underwater.
[01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:26.520]   So like just put the plant here.
[01:49:26.520 --> 01:49:27.520]   Water.
[01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:29.880]   But also, I mean, up north, you can use air cooling.
[01:49:29.880 --> 01:49:33.800]   You know, I mean, this is so we're doing a whole series of features on the ridge about
[01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:37.080]   this, about, you know, data center cooling methods.
[01:49:37.080 --> 01:49:41.520]   And building data centers in the middle of a desert makes no sense whatsoever.
[01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:45.600]   I love capitalism, but it's very clear that there are misaligned incentives built in
[01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:46.600]   capitalism.
[01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:54.240]   And one of the misaligned incentives is make money, but at the cost of a sensible, you
[01:49:54.240 --> 01:49:56.120]   know, long-term strategy, right?
[01:49:56.120 --> 01:49:59.840]   Oh, well, I mean, there's a classic paper from Goldman Sachs last year where they pointed
[01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:06.160]   out that actually developing cures is much less profitable developing treatments.
[01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:07.160]   That's right.
[01:50:07.160 --> 01:50:08.160]   So, you know, you should.
[01:50:08.160 --> 01:50:09.160]   You don't want to cure anybody.
[01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:10.160]   Yeah, you don't.
[01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:11.160]   You should be curing stuff.
[01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:13.160]   You should focus on treating it.
[01:50:13.160 --> 01:50:16.800]   You know, it's apparently according to the Wall Street Journal a couple of days ago, the
[01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:23.360]   root one of the reasons she ended the zero COVID policy was from a letter from Terry
[01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:29.920]   Gao, the founder of Foxconn, who warned that strict COVID controls with threatened China's
[01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:32.080]   position in global supply chains.
[01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:33.560]   Duh.
[01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:39.760]   And and it's interesting the power of economics in even in the Chinese Communist Party, right?
[01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:41.640]   Now, Jack Mo, though, did it?
[01:50:41.640 --> 01:50:42.640]   No.
[01:50:42.640 --> 01:50:47.720]   Let me ask Connie the long time 12 years Apple reporter in those years.
[01:50:47.720 --> 01:50:54.040]   I'm sure many times you wrote about Apple's Titan car project, the desire to create a
[01:50:54.040 --> 01:50:56.520]   self-driving vehicle.
[01:50:56.520 --> 01:50:59.560]   Yes, you love that story.
[01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:01.920]   You can't wait to talk more about it.
[01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:04.960]   You know, I don't know.
[01:51:04.960 --> 01:51:09.640]   I mean, I think at one point, I was much more bullish that they might do it.
[01:51:09.640 --> 01:51:15.720]   But honestly, I think, you know, Tim Cook is very smart and very pragmatic about what
[01:51:15.720 --> 01:51:19.200]   Apple knows and doesn't know and where they can add value.
[01:51:19.200 --> 01:51:22.760]   Certainly they figured out they could add value to the entertainment system.
[01:51:22.760 --> 01:51:23.760]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:24.760]   Very well.
[01:51:24.760 --> 01:51:25.760]   And abusive.
[01:51:25.760 --> 01:51:26.760]   Yep.
[01:51:26.760 --> 01:51:28.840]   You know, building a self-driving car.
[01:51:28.840 --> 01:51:30.720]   You know, what do we all know about Apple?
[01:51:30.720 --> 01:51:32.720]   They're never first into the marketplace, right?
[01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:36.040]   They wait for everyone else to go in and take all the risks and they come in and do it in
[01:51:36.040 --> 01:51:38.680]   a more elegant, streamlined way.
[01:51:38.680 --> 01:51:40.560]   And so I don't know.
[01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:41.560]   It's expensive.
[01:51:41.560 --> 01:51:44.640]   They certainly have the cash if they wanted to it.
[01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:47.600]   They have more cash than most countries on the planet.
[01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:49.600]   They're planning, though.
[01:51:49.600 --> 01:51:50.600]   They have to plan.
[01:51:50.600 --> 01:51:55.320]   They have to, and Tim knows this, they have to plan for the next big thing, right?
[01:51:55.320 --> 01:51:57.040]   That the iPhone isn't going to carry him forever.
[01:51:57.040 --> 01:51:58.040]   They have to figure out.
[01:51:58.040 --> 01:52:02.080]   So this is where the augmented reality and VR headset.
[01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:03.080]   It seems more likely.
[01:52:03.080 --> 01:52:04.080]   I'm wondering.
[01:52:04.080 --> 01:52:10.400]   I mean, I'm wondering at this point, it certainly, certainly not looking that good for metaverse.
[01:52:10.400 --> 01:52:13.680]   Well, come back to original point, I will say point blank.
[01:52:13.680 --> 01:52:16.600]   There will never be an Apple car in the way that it's that.
[01:52:16.600 --> 01:52:21.720]   According to Mark Kerman, the car project has been in limbo for the past several months.
[01:52:21.720 --> 01:52:27.040]   As Apple executives grappled with the reality, yeah, that its vision for a fully autonomous
[01:52:27.040 --> 01:52:31.360]   vehicle without a steering wheeler pedals is not feasible with current technology.
[01:52:31.360 --> 01:52:32.360]   They don't want to go down the...
[01:52:32.360 --> 01:52:33.360]   Where's current technology?
[01:52:33.360 --> 01:52:34.360]   It's a terrible...
[01:52:34.360 --> 01:52:35.360]   The Tesla regulation.
[01:52:35.360 --> 01:52:37.200]   I mean, you come completely stuff on the streets with that much.
[01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:38.200]   So they're dumping the autonomy...
[01:52:38.200 --> 01:52:39.200]   It will never happen.
[01:52:39.200 --> 01:52:43.600]   According to German, they're now planning a less ambitious design that will include a
[01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:50.120]   steering wheel and pedals, only one, but still pedals, and oh no, they'll have multiple.
[01:52:50.120 --> 01:52:53.800]   And only support full autonomous capabilities on highways.
[01:52:53.800 --> 01:52:55.680]   That's what right now many...
[01:52:55.680 --> 01:52:56.680]   That's what any...
[01:52:56.680 --> 01:52:57.680]   That's what any...
[01:52:57.680 --> 01:52:58.680]   That's what any...
[01:52:58.680 --> 01:53:01.920]   And they won't get there until 2026.
[01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:05.720]   They're even going to sell the division off.
[01:53:05.720 --> 01:53:07.320]   We're going to shut it down.
[01:53:07.320 --> 01:53:08.320]   That's the way they stand.
[01:53:08.320 --> 01:53:09.320]   And sell it to who?
[01:53:09.320 --> 01:53:10.320]   And there...
[01:53:10.320 --> 01:53:11.320]   Well, this is it.
[01:53:11.320 --> 01:53:12.320]   Very few people buying at the moment.
[01:53:12.320 --> 01:53:14.720]   Maybe the software might sell, but that's about it.
[01:53:14.720 --> 01:53:19.120]   Can I just say how let down I am by this entire autonomy situation?
[01:53:19.120 --> 01:53:23.600]   If you go back a couple of years, basically anything in LIDAR autonomy was raising just
[01:53:23.600 --> 01:53:28.320]   oodles of venture capital, highest paid engineers out there, talent, war.
[01:53:28.320 --> 01:53:29.560]   And I was doing the self driving project.
[01:53:29.560 --> 01:53:34.120]   I had such hope that I was not going to have to relearn how to drive.
[01:53:34.120 --> 01:53:39.680]   Now everyone has let me down and my stupid butt has to relearn how to drive a car.
[01:53:39.680 --> 01:53:40.680]   And we have an automatic now.
[01:53:40.680 --> 01:53:42.000]   I don't know how to drive automatic.
[01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:43.480]   It's like two freaking pedals.
[01:53:43.480 --> 01:53:44.480]   Where do you shift?
[01:53:44.480 --> 01:53:45.480]   It's terrifying.
[01:53:45.480 --> 01:53:50.640]   But anyways, Apple, Apple, listen, move the iPhone production to some other countries.
[01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:53.920]   Take all the money, put it in self driving cars because I need one.
[01:53:53.920 --> 01:53:54.920]   Please Lord.
[01:53:54.920 --> 01:53:55.920]   What about me?
[01:53:55.920 --> 01:53:58.040]   I'm getting old.
[01:53:58.040 --> 01:53:59.040]   I don't want to.
[01:53:59.040 --> 01:54:00.040]   I don't want to have to drive.
[01:54:00.040 --> 01:54:01.040]   I don't want to.
[01:54:01.040 --> 01:54:06.440]   The worst thing is having Lisa drive and me sitting in the passenger seat.
[01:54:06.440 --> 01:54:08.440]   You see, I've driven with you and you're very careful.
[01:54:08.440 --> 01:54:10.920]   I was very careful driver driving with the Lisa.
[01:54:10.920 --> 01:54:12.360]   It might be slightly.
[01:54:12.360 --> 01:54:16.400]   You might find my fingerprints in the arm rest rather have test.
[01:54:16.400 --> 01:54:17.880]   I'd rather have Elon drive.
[01:54:17.880 --> 01:54:19.360]   No, I get the feeling she's got foot.
[01:54:19.360 --> 01:54:20.360]   She's a foot to the floor.
[01:54:20.360 --> 01:54:21.360]   Very good.
[01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:22.360]   Very good driver.
[01:54:22.360 --> 01:54:23.360]   Very good.
[01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:24.360]   Never had an accident.
[01:54:24.360 --> 01:54:25.360]   Very good.
[01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:26.360]   Yeah.
[01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:27.360]   She scares me.
[01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:28.360]   Yeah.
[01:54:28.360 --> 01:54:37.040]   Apple, apparently, according to the National Labor Relations Board pursued illegal anti union
[01:54:37.040 --> 01:54:38.920]   tactics.
[01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:43.200]   The company either settles or they're going to issue a complaint.
[01:54:43.200 --> 01:54:44.960]   The union itself is upset.
[01:54:44.960 --> 01:54:50.200]   CWA communications workers of America says Apple thinks the rules don't apply to them.
[01:54:50.200 --> 01:54:57.320]   The NLRB concluded that in the Atlanta region, anyway, Apple held mandatory anti union meetings
[01:54:57.320 --> 01:55:00.120]   during which management made coercive statements.
[01:55:00.120 --> 01:55:06.640]   In other words, the investigation is over and they're saying pay up or we sue.
[01:55:06.640 --> 01:55:09.040]   Apple did not have a response.
[01:55:09.040 --> 01:55:10.040]   Shockingly.
[01:55:10.040 --> 01:55:11.040]   Yeah.
[01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:18.640]   It's interesting because in Maryland where the, or I'm sorry, St. Louis, where the union
[01:55:18.640 --> 01:55:26.800]   workers wanted to join the aerospace union, the IAM, they withdrew the petition.
[01:55:26.800 --> 01:55:32.240]   The IAM, the union said because it was because of the company, the worker said, yeah, we
[01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:37.520]   actually nobody wanted it.
[01:55:37.520 --> 01:55:38.920]   It's an interesting situation.
[01:55:38.920 --> 01:55:45.360]   Apple has clearly adopted some of the strong arm tactics that were better known in the
[01:55:45.360 --> 01:55:46.360]   day of Henry Ford.
[01:55:46.360 --> 01:55:47.360]   Oh, no.
[01:55:47.360 --> 01:55:48.360]   Okay.
[01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:49.360]   They're not hiring.
[01:55:49.360 --> 01:55:50.360]   They didn't bring in the bank.
[01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:51.360]   I was concerned.
[01:55:51.360 --> 01:55:54.320]   They're not hiring Pinktons to bring heads or bring the army in to shoot up the miners as
[01:55:54.320 --> 01:55:56.040]   they used to in the 1920s.
[01:55:56.040 --> 01:55:58.760]   But you know, it's they're a big company.
[01:55:58.760 --> 01:56:04.560]   If you treat your stuff, if you treat your stuff, look, I was a member of union for many
[01:56:04.560 --> 01:56:05.560]   years.
[01:56:05.560 --> 01:56:10.040]   Some because it gave me certain, you know, you get a press card in the UK and you get
[01:56:10.040 --> 01:56:12.240]   full legal cover, which is great.
[01:56:12.240 --> 01:56:17.400]   But for people like factory workers for retail stuff or that sort of thing, the only way
[01:56:17.400 --> 01:56:20.240]   you're going to get management to listen to you.
[01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:25.840]   If that only choice you have, oh no, if the only choice you have is to go through all
[01:56:25.840 --> 01:56:31.840]   the hassle and heartbreak of joining, forming and joining a union, it's a sign of bad management.
[01:56:31.840 --> 01:56:32.840]   Yeah.
[01:56:32.840 --> 01:56:37.280]   You know, if you're not treating a start, if you're treating a stuff so badly that they
[01:56:37.280 --> 01:56:42.240]   want to form a union, you've really mucked up.
[01:56:42.240 --> 01:56:46.360]   Also, if you don't want to have unions, don't hire tons of people that work in a retail
[01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:49.560]   store, for example, or if you're Amazon warehouses.
[01:56:49.560 --> 01:56:55.400]   I mean, like these people expect that their policies that work with technology workers
[01:56:55.400 --> 01:56:58.000]   will work with other sorts of jobs.
[01:56:58.000 --> 01:57:00.080]   And it's not the case.
[01:57:00.080 --> 01:57:02.840]   I've always found the argument that tech workers shouldn't unionize because they're
[01:57:02.840 --> 01:57:07.760]   well compensated to be specious because it's ridiculous and stupid and overly corporately
[01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:08.760]   subservient.
[01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:11.720]   But you know, come on, these are retail workers, but I'm unionized.
[01:57:11.720 --> 01:57:17.360]   And every time that a company that has hundreds of billions of dollars says that no, you
[01:57:17.360 --> 01:57:22.360]   can't and then breaks the rules in these ways, it strikes me that the core of the company's
[01:57:22.360 --> 01:57:25.480]   soul must be really rotten.
[01:57:25.480 --> 01:57:26.480]   And it's just sad.
[01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:28.880]   I did see an interesting article some weeks ago.
[01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:35.200]   I can't remember where that said tech, some tech CEOs were rooting for Elon because he
[01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:39.880]   was taking the entitled engineers down a peg.
[01:57:39.880 --> 01:57:44.600]   But that this is one of the big problems that companies like Apple and Google with the
[01:57:44.600 --> 01:57:50.320]   engineers is they have so much power because they're so important and so scarce because
[01:57:50.320 --> 01:57:51.800]   they do the work.
[01:57:51.800 --> 01:57:59.040]   You know, any number of managers and HR people and the rest of it.
[01:57:59.040 --> 01:58:04.280]   But when it comes down to it, if you're doing the work which makes all that money, you should
[01:58:04.280 --> 01:58:05.520]   get a fair share of it.
[01:58:05.520 --> 01:58:09.920]   That's why we have no work of us and espresso machines.
[01:58:09.920 --> 01:58:11.920]   You can take your pizza oven and shut.
[01:58:11.920 --> 01:58:12.920]   Okay.
[01:58:12.920 --> 01:58:16.200]   Give people a decent wage and some dignity at work.
[01:58:16.200 --> 01:58:17.800]   That's all they're looking for.
[01:58:17.800 --> 01:58:21.520]   I guess they probably do the pizza ovens hoping that they could pay them less, but at least
[01:58:21.520 --> 01:58:22.520]   you get free pizza.
[01:58:22.520 --> 01:58:25.560]   I mean, there's a certain group of people that would actually be a good deal.
[01:58:25.560 --> 01:58:29.200]   I had a friend who joined Google and they're like, oh, I'm taking the Google bus down to
[01:58:29.200 --> 01:58:31.040]   work and you're like, oh, that's great.
[01:58:31.040 --> 01:58:32.040]   It's safe to commute.
[01:58:32.040 --> 01:58:34.680]   It's like, yeah, but you're expected to work when you're on the bus.
[01:58:34.680 --> 01:58:36.880]   So now I've got an extra two hours of work on my day.
[01:58:36.880 --> 01:58:39.320]   At least Google didn't put bedrooms in the conference room.
[01:58:39.320 --> 01:58:42.840]   Can I make a point here?
[01:58:42.840 --> 01:58:45.960]   I think it's ironic that a lot of these people that we're talking about that are praising
[01:58:45.960 --> 01:58:49.520]   Elon or anti-remote work because they think people will do more work in the office.
[01:58:49.520 --> 01:58:51.080]   But she is as well.
[01:58:51.080 --> 01:58:56.200]   Which is so strange to me because when I work from the house, I work in Providence, which
[01:58:56.200 --> 01:58:58.400]   is not a tech or journalism city.
[01:58:58.400 --> 01:59:01.480]   And I eat at my desk every day.
[01:59:01.480 --> 01:59:07.640]   And when I worked in an office, I had friends who were around and we would go places and
[01:59:07.640 --> 01:59:08.720]   eat and sit.
[01:59:08.720 --> 01:59:09.720]   But that's you.
[01:59:09.720 --> 01:59:10.720]   You like having friends.
[01:59:10.720 --> 01:59:13.720]   Oh, but you're saying you were getting work done.
[01:59:13.720 --> 01:59:14.720]   It was less.
[01:59:14.720 --> 01:59:18.200]   Yeah, because there's that guy who comes around to the cubicle and says, oh, how are you
[01:59:18.200 --> 01:59:19.200]   doing?
[01:59:19.200 --> 01:59:21.560]   You're trying to work and he's bothering you.
[01:59:21.560 --> 01:59:25.800]   And then there's the meeting that the middle manager has to do to prove his worth and existence
[01:59:25.800 --> 01:59:27.360]   that takes an hour out of your life.
[01:59:27.360 --> 01:59:28.360]   You'll never get back.
[01:59:28.360 --> 01:59:29.360]   You're right.
[01:59:29.360 --> 01:59:30.360]   Go home.
[01:59:30.360 --> 01:59:31.360]   Working home.
[01:59:31.360 --> 01:59:32.360]   I agree with you.
[01:59:32.360 --> 01:59:33.360]   I happened to the whole quarantine.
[01:59:33.360 --> 01:59:35.120]   I worked here.
[01:59:35.120 --> 01:59:39.320]   But so I kind of like coming into work, but not everybody does.
[01:59:39.320 --> 01:59:42.640]   And for those who don't, you shouldn't have to say Connie, have you been working from
[01:59:42.640 --> 01:59:45.520]   home over the pandemic or?
[01:59:45.520 --> 01:59:46.520]   I have.
[01:59:46.520 --> 01:59:51.240]   I ran the scene editorial team with in my pajamas for my dining room table for the
[01:59:51.240 --> 01:59:52.560]   first two years.
[01:59:52.560 --> 01:59:57.200]   We are now back in the office two days a week for most staff, but we still have a lot of
[01:59:57.200 --> 02:00:02.080]   flexibility because once you run your business remotely, you can show that you can run your
[02:00:02.080 --> 02:00:03.080]   business remotely.
[02:00:03.080 --> 02:00:04.080]   Yeah.
[02:00:04.080 --> 02:00:06.240]   And then the argument is why do you need to do it in person?
[02:00:06.240 --> 02:00:10.680]   Well, I will say there are definitely some advantages to having people together.
[02:00:10.680 --> 02:00:15.400]   You like brainstorming and there's camaraderie and conversations might happen.
[02:00:15.400 --> 02:00:21.400]   And there's nothing, there's no reason anything has to be an either or black or white.
[02:00:21.400 --> 02:00:24.200]   They don't have to all work in person.
[02:00:24.200 --> 02:00:26.720]   I don't think you're doing your job, right?
[02:00:26.720 --> 02:00:28.080]   Hybrid is the future.
[02:00:28.080 --> 02:00:29.080]   Yeah.
[02:00:29.080 --> 02:00:30.080]   Forever going forward.
[02:00:30.080 --> 02:00:32.160]   Factory workers have to touch things.
[02:00:32.160 --> 02:00:33.160]   Right.
[02:00:33.160 --> 02:00:34.160]   Unfortunately, they have to be in the factory.
[02:00:34.160 --> 02:00:35.160]   I get that.
[02:00:35.160 --> 02:00:40.520]   Or you work in a coffee shop where you're pulling coffee out, unless there's a remote and there's
[02:00:40.520 --> 02:00:42.280]   a coffee machine in the cafeteria.
[02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:46.840]   By the way, you are fully trained on how to use because those things are not two seconds
[02:00:46.840 --> 02:00:47.840]   to use.
[02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:48.840]   Great respect to Barista.
[02:00:48.840 --> 02:00:51.880]   So take some skill to know how to use those coffee machines.
[02:00:51.880 --> 02:00:57.920]   So it's about flexibility, but I think to the larger point, it's about treating people
[02:00:57.920 --> 02:01:03.400]   as people and what do you need in order to be successful as a company today?
[02:01:03.400 --> 02:01:08.360]   And if it's only profit because the five founders or two founders or one founder wants to be
[02:01:08.360 --> 02:01:11.040]   a billionaire, well, how many billions do you need?
[02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:12.040]   Yeah.
[02:01:12.040 --> 02:01:13.040]   So it goes back to 12.
[02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:16.040]   But it goes back to that.
[02:01:16.040 --> 02:01:17.040]   I'd take one.
[02:01:17.040 --> 02:01:18.960]   I'd be happy with one.
[02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:19.960]   One billion.
[02:01:19.960 --> 02:01:21.520]   What is the purpose of capitalism?
[02:01:21.520 --> 02:01:22.520]   Right.
[02:01:22.520 --> 02:01:25.080]   What is if you're not paying people, right?
[02:01:25.080 --> 02:01:28.720]   Henry Ford, make the cars affordable because the people making them in the factories won't
[02:01:28.720 --> 02:01:30.120]   ever be able to buy one.
[02:01:30.120 --> 02:01:31.120]   Yeah.
[02:01:31.120 --> 02:01:32.120]   And he paid his still hands.
[02:01:32.120 --> 02:01:33.120]   Well, what?
[02:01:33.120 --> 02:01:34.120]   Right.
[02:01:34.120 --> 02:01:38.640]   So it just, you know, I love that Hershey story, by the way.
[02:01:38.640 --> 02:01:39.640]   That's a great story.
[02:01:39.640 --> 02:01:40.640]   I have to watch that show.
[02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:41.640]   Go look it up.
[02:01:41.640 --> 02:01:42.640]   Yeah.
[02:01:42.640 --> 02:01:43.640]   Well, the same thing happened in the UK.
[02:01:43.640 --> 02:01:45.040]   We have Bornville chocolate.
[02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:49.000]   They built an entire company town and they didn't include any pubs with it because he
[02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:50.680]   was a Quaker and didn't believe in it.
[02:01:50.680 --> 02:01:52.720]   But that kind of stuff used to go on.
[02:01:52.720 --> 02:01:53.960]   And it's still going on.
[02:01:53.960 --> 02:01:59.080]   Googlers building a campus with housing down in South San Francisco at the moment.
[02:01:59.080 --> 02:02:00.720]   But there's no chocolate.
[02:02:00.720 --> 02:02:01.720]   No chocolate.
[02:02:01.720 --> 02:02:02.720]   No, no.
[02:02:02.720 --> 02:02:04.120]   Although, oh God, there is booze.
[02:02:04.120 --> 02:02:05.120]   There's lots of booze.
[02:02:05.120 --> 02:02:06.120]   Well, we used to on the register.
[02:02:06.120 --> 02:02:07.120]   We used to prefer.
[02:02:07.120 --> 02:02:08.120]   You can't move water.
[02:02:08.120 --> 02:02:09.120]   What is it about?
[02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:10.120]   What is it about chocolate magnets?
[02:02:10.120 --> 02:02:11.120]   Those are the nice people.
[02:02:11.120 --> 02:02:12.120]   The people who make chocolate.
[02:02:12.120 --> 02:02:13.120]   Oh, very nice.
[02:02:13.120 --> 02:02:14.120]   Well, not Nestle.
[02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:15.120]   Oh, well, yeah.
[02:02:15.120 --> 02:02:16.120]   True to Swiss.
[02:02:16.120 --> 02:02:19.120]   So that's another story in time.
[02:02:19.120 --> 02:02:24.200]   Hey, there is, I want to give Apple props because there is an Apple story that is a,
[02:02:24.200 --> 02:02:28.920]   I think a bigger story than it's been getting coverage for.
[02:02:28.920 --> 02:02:29.920]   It deserves it.
[02:02:29.920 --> 02:02:37.320]   Apple is turning on end to end encryption for more things, including iCloud backups.
[02:02:37.320 --> 02:02:38.320]   And that is huge.
[02:02:38.320 --> 02:02:45.960]   They're going to turn on end to end encryption for notes, for iCloud drive, for photos, reminders,
[02:02:45.960 --> 02:02:50.440]   Safari bookmarks, Siri shortcuts, voice memos, and wallet passes.
[02:02:50.440 --> 02:02:56.240]   In fact, the only major category is not covered by this advanced data protection or iCloud
[02:02:56.240 --> 02:02:58.840]   mail, contacts and calendar.
[02:02:58.840 --> 02:03:02.440]   And that's just because they have to interoperate with other calendar systems.
[02:03:02.440 --> 02:03:03.440]   This is huge.
[02:03:03.440 --> 02:03:05.640]   And you know, their FBI is not happy.
[02:03:05.640 --> 02:03:11.920]   Well, apparently, I mean, I think it was Matt, I was at Matt Green was talking about this.
[02:03:11.920 --> 02:03:14.720]   They've had this capability since about 2016.
[02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:17.680]   Yeah, apparently the FBI told them not to turn it on.
[02:03:17.680 --> 02:03:18.680]   Yeah.
[02:03:18.680 --> 02:03:22.160]   Well, you remember the San Bernardino shooting where they went head to head with the FBI.
[02:03:22.160 --> 02:03:25.800]   Apple's response, by the way, when the FBI called and said, "We have this phone, we
[02:03:25.800 --> 02:03:30.560]   can't unlock it, you have to help us," was, "All you have to do is bring the phone back
[02:03:30.560 --> 02:03:35.240]   to his apartment where it will get on the Wi-Fi, upload to the iCloud, and we'll give you everything
[02:03:35.240 --> 02:03:40.320]   back," because Apple for years has had the keys to iCloud and been willing to give law
[02:03:40.320 --> 02:03:42.960]   enforcement, had to give law enforcement anything they wanted.
[02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:46.600]   And that was always there out.
[02:03:46.600 --> 02:03:49.920]   My understanding is they screwed the pooch on that because they tried to open it with
[02:03:49.920 --> 02:03:50.920]   various different policies.
[02:03:50.920 --> 02:03:51.920]   Yeah, the FBI screwed up.
[02:03:51.920 --> 02:03:52.920]   Yeah.
[02:03:52.920 --> 02:03:53.920]   Yeah.
[02:03:53.920 --> 02:03:55.560]   So that's been a long-standing thing.
[02:03:55.560 --> 02:04:02.320]   So it's very interesting for me to hear that Apple is going to go up against the FBI, the
[02:04:02.320 --> 02:04:08.200]   UK government as well, the Australian government as well, and make it so that when a lawful
[02:04:08.200 --> 02:04:12.620]   subpoena comes from these law enforcement agencies, Apple can say, "Hey, we'd love to
[02:04:12.620 --> 02:04:13.960]   give it to you.
[02:04:13.960 --> 02:04:14.960]   We can't.
[02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:17.680]   It's encrypted and we don't hold the keys."
[02:04:17.680 --> 02:04:21.320]   I can understand why Apple might want that, but they're going to -- good on them, by the
[02:04:21.320 --> 02:04:25.760]   way, we as users should all want that.
[02:04:25.760 --> 02:04:27.320]   That's real privacy.
[02:04:27.320 --> 02:04:31.520]   I guess they decided that it was better to make the users happy than the FBI.
[02:04:31.520 --> 02:04:32.520]   They're going to get some heat.
[02:04:32.520 --> 02:04:33.720]   And what are they going to do in China?
[02:04:33.720 --> 02:04:35.400]   Because China is not going to like this.
[02:04:35.400 --> 02:04:38.840]   Well, they're not going to have this function the same way in China, I presume.
[02:04:38.840 --> 02:04:40.240]   But I will say, points to Apple here.
[02:04:40.240 --> 02:04:41.240]   I agree.
[02:04:41.240 --> 02:04:42.240]   This is great.
[02:04:42.240 --> 02:04:43.240]   This is the Wall Street Journal.
[02:04:43.240 --> 02:04:45.240]   Rolls out in China in early 2023.
[02:04:45.240 --> 02:04:46.240]   Whoa.
[02:04:46.240 --> 02:04:47.240]   That's brave.
[02:04:47.240 --> 02:04:48.240]   I would be very surprised.
[02:04:48.240 --> 02:04:49.240]   That's crazy.
[02:04:49.240 --> 02:04:54.720]   The Chinese government would be saying, "Nice factories you've got there would be a shame
[02:04:54.720 --> 02:04:56.160]   if something happened to them."
[02:04:56.160 --> 02:04:59.400]   Because, I mean, Apple's big thing is, yeah, we keep your data secure.
[02:04:59.400 --> 02:05:00.960]   We keep your data private.
[02:05:00.960 --> 02:05:03.840]   Asterisk offers does not apply in China.
[02:05:03.840 --> 02:05:08.720]   Well, but look what, so look what everyone Foxconn's founder wrote to President Xi.
[02:05:08.720 --> 02:05:09.720]   She said, "You know what?
[02:05:09.720 --> 02:05:12.000]   This thing is going to cost you."
[02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:13.840]   She backed down on COVID-0.
[02:05:13.840 --> 02:05:15.040]   That's a big deal.
[02:05:15.040 --> 02:05:19.400]   I think China probably, I mean, Apple's kind of thinking to himself, maybe this is the
[02:05:19.400 --> 02:05:26.280]   time to say, "Look, you want to keep those factories in the in the in the Zhengzhou.
[02:05:26.280 --> 02:05:29.600]   You want to keep iPhone City going.
[02:05:29.600 --> 02:05:31.280]   This is our demand.
[02:05:31.280 --> 02:05:35.760]   I think it's going to be very interesting to see what happens here."
[02:05:35.760 --> 02:05:37.840]   They also dropped, and this is also good news.
[02:05:37.840 --> 02:05:43.040]   Their plans to do on phone scanning for CSAM, child sexual abuse.
[02:05:43.040 --> 02:05:47.600]   Imagine you remember when they announced that there was an uproar, a fewer over that saying,
[02:05:47.600 --> 02:05:53.000]   "Look, no one's in favor of child sexual abuse imagery, but you can't.
[02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:59.200]   There's no way to do this that doesn't compromise everybody's privacy as a side effect."
[02:05:59.200 --> 02:06:01.200]   So that's fantastic.
[02:06:01.200 --> 02:06:07.440]   News, Apple also announced support down for the PASKEEZ system.
[02:06:07.440 --> 02:06:08.680]   Good for Apple.
[02:06:08.680 --> 02:06:09.680]   Yeah.
[02:06:09.680 --> 02:06:10.680]   Right.
[02:06:10.680 --> 02:06:17.600]   I mean, Apple's stance on generally privacy is better than most because they are not an
[02:06:17.600 --> 02:06:19.880]   ad-first business.
[02:06:19.880 --> 02:06:20.880]   That's changing.
[02:06:20.880 --> 02:06:23.480]   I think as we've seen, Apple evolved as a company.
[02:06:23.480 --> 02:06:27.200]   But if you want to have a slightly more security device, it seems to be reasonable to be an
[02:06:27.200 --> 02:06:29.400]   iOS, which is why I'm an iPhone user.
[02:06:29.400 --> 02:06:30.400]   It happened forever.
[02:06:30.400 --> 02:06:33.920]   So points, that doesn't take away the other stuff we've talked about.
[02:06:33.920 --> 02:06:35.160]   But yeah, I'll give you some points, sir.
[02:06:35.160 --> 02:06:36.160]   I'll give you some points, sir.
[02:06:36.160 --> 02:06:40.640]   I do think Tim Cook finally said, "All right, we're going to actually live up to our promise
[02:06:40.640 --> 02:06:45.760]   of what's on the iPhone stays on the iPhone."
[02:06:45.760 --> 02:06:49.760]   I think Apple has tried to carve out a place for itself in the marketplace as being very
[02:06:49.760 --> 02:06:52.200]   privacy forward and being privacy.
[02:06:52.200 --> 02:06:56.520]   But sometimes it seems that it's a marketing strategy rather than a real.
[02:06:56.520 --> 02:06:57.520]   Yeah.
[02:06:57.520 --> 02:06:59.040]   But I think that they have tried.
[02:06:59.040 --> 02:07:01.400]   I mean, this is an example of them pushing the buckets.
[02:07:01.400 --> 02:07:06.440]   I think your theory about how they are using it to coerce the Chinese government is interesting
[02:07:06.440 --> 02:07:08.640]   as that comes out.
[02:07:08.640 --> 02:07:11.080]   That's the story I'll read and see how it plays.
[02:07:11.080 --> 02:07:12.080]   Yeah.
[02:07:12.080 --> 02:07:18.040]   I mean, I think them going up against the FBI in that San Bernardino case was also an example
[02:07:18.040 --> 02:07:22.760]   of them saying, "This is slippery slope and we need to stop before we go too far down
[02:07:22.760 --> 02:07:23.760]   that slope."
[02:07:23.760 --> 02:07:25.520]   I've had this capability for years.
[02:07:25.520 --> 02:07:29.560]   They didn't do it for years.
[02:07:29.560 --> 02:07:31.560]   Why now?
[02:07:31.560 --> 02:07:33.680]   What do you think?
[02:07:33.680 --> 02:07:37.440]   Because the heats died down after the San Bernardino thing?
[02:07:37.440 --> 02:07:39.840]   I think, here's what I think.
[02:07:39.840 --> 02:07:43.120]   Apple was starting to get a lot of heat over the last six months over the ads that they
[02:07:43.120 --> 02:07:44.880]   were starting to put in there.
[02:07:44.880 --> 02:07:49.040]   And evidence that Apple was in fact sending lots of information back to the home office
[02:07:49.040 --> 02:07:50.040]   and so forth.
[02:07:50.040 --> 02:07:54.280]   They were starting to look like that it was, this privacy thing was merely a marketing
[02:07:54.280 --> 02:07:55.280]   push.
[02:07:55.280 --> 02:07:57.560]   They weren't living up to it.
[02:07:57.560 --> 02:08:01.080]   And I think they realized that that's going to hurt them in the long run.
[02:08:01.080 --> 02:08:04.480]   They're getting a lot of heat over the other things like the App Store.
[02:08:04.480 --> 02:08:08.400]   This was their chance to become a white knight and to stand up for it.
[02:08:08.400 --> 02:08:11.800]   Because this is exactly what people like Matthew Green say, "You got to do end to
[02:08:11.800 --> 02:08:12.800]   end encryption.
[02:08:12.800 --> 02:08:13.800]   You don't hold the keys.
[02:08:13.800 --> 02:08:15.520]   We hold the keys."
[02:08:15.520 --> 02:08:20.800]   And I think they also, by the way, are probably making the calculus that most users will not
[02:08:20.800 --> 02:08:23.840]   turn on advanced data protection.
[02:08:23.840 --> 02:08:30.120]   That they still in many cases be able to turn that information over to law enforcement.
[02:08:30.120 --> 02:08:33.880]   Because it is a separate, I think it's going to be a separate setting and you will sacrifice
[02:08:33.880 --> 02:08:35.080]   some capabilities.
[02:08:35.080 --> 02:08:39.500]   Because if it's end to end encrypted, there's things Apple can't do because they can't see
[02:08:39.500 --> 02:08:42.000]   into your files.
[02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:43.000]   What do you think Connie?
[02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:44.000]   Why now?
[02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:48.080]   I think you said it, right?
[02:08:48.080 --> 02:08:51.600]   They've been getting pressure from a lot of different areas.
[02:08:51.600 --> 02:08:54.720]   The App Store has not gone away.
[02:08:54.720 --> 02:08:57.760]   They had a black eye over Epic.
[02:08:57.760 --> 02:09:00.120]   People have been talking about that still.
[02:09:00.120 --> 02:09:04.240]   They have been talking about privacy and touting privacy.
[02:09:04.240 --> 02:09:09.000]   At some point, this is what you say now show is what you do.
[02:09:09.000 --> 02:09:11.000]   I give them points on this one.
[02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:12.000]   I think timing.
[02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:18.880]   Look, most of us keep our phones now for longer than we ever have.
[02:09:18.880 --> 02:09:25.160]   It's come down to just a very few players in the marketplace, Microsoft on the side.
[02:09:25.160 --> 02:09:30.440]   They need a reason to get people to want to lock into their ecosystem and be on that
[02:09:30.440 --> 02:09:35.560]   path to either upgrade every year or every other year and have a reason to want to come
[02:09:35.560 --> 02:09:36.560]   back.
[02:09:36.560 --> 02:09:41.600]   Privacy and we add privacy things is part of their sales pitch.
[02:09:41.600 --> 02:09:42.840]   Why not?
[02:09:42.840 --> 02:09:44.280]   The market is not.
[02:09:44.280 --> 02:09:47.520]   Everybody on the planet pretty much has a phone.
[02:09:47.520 --> 02:09:55.600]   In the US, the sales of smartphones continue to decline because people are just stretching
[02:09:55.600 --> 02:10:01.480]   how much longer they have their phones as Alex is showing us.
[02:10:01.480 --> 02:10:07.000]   It's part of a story to try to make it more compelling to pick this platform over another.
[02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:08.600]   You're not just picking the iPhone.
[02:10:08.600 --> 02:10:12.280]   As we've all said, you're picking their ecosystem and all the services and everything that go
[02:10:12.280 --> 02:10:13.280]   in with them.
[02:10:13.280 --> 02:10:14.280]   Good for them.
[02:10:14.280 --> 02:10:18.240]   I hope I'm not being too cynical and saying, "Well, they just said this is a good PR."
[02:10:18.240 --> 02:10:19.400]   They really are committed to this.
[02:10:19.400 --> 02:10:20.400]   I'm glad they did it.
[02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:22.240]   Even though it took them years, I'm glad they did it.
[02:10:22.240 --> 02:10:23.920]   I hope they are as well.
[02:10:23.920 --> 02:10:24.920]   Yes.
[02:10:24.920 --> 02:10:25.920]   I'm going to have to say on that.
[02:10:25.920 --> 02:10:30.520]   Turn on advanced data protection when it becomes available on your iPhone next year.
[02:10:30.520 --> 02:10:31.520]   Let's take a little break.
[02:10:31.520 --> 02:10:34.480]   Final words, final thoughts coming up?
[02:10:34.480 --> 02:10:38.120]   Some of the best stories of the show are always at the end.
[02:10:38.120 --> 02:10:40.280]   I shouldn't mention the fun ones.
[02:10:40.280 --> 02:10:46.920]   Like for instance, the word of the year from Oxford English Dictionary.
[02:10:46.920 --> 02:10:47.920]   Stay here.
[02:10:47.920 --> 02:10:50.760]   Our show today brought to you by Wealthfront.
[02:10:50.760 --> 02:10:56.120]   Wealthfront's goal is to make building long-term wealth easy.
[02:10:56.120 --> 02:10:58.360]   They do it in two ways now.
[02:10:58.360 --> 02:11:01.360]   You've always talked about the automated investing accounts.
[02:11:01.360 --> 02:11:03.880]   Now they also have high-heeled savings.
[02:11:03.880 --> 02:11:08.000]   All of it inside this beautifully designed interface.
[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:10.040]   I just love the Wealthfront app.
[02:11:10.040 --> 02:11:12.480]   Is your bank keeping money that could be yours?
[02:11:12.480 --> 02:11:18.200]   If you're earning less than Wealthfront's, "Wow, get this 3.30% APY."
[02:11:18.200 --> 02:11:21.920]   I think they might be taking a little bit more federal interest rates have been going up,
[02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:22.920]   right?
[02:11:22.920 --> 02:11:25.560]   Banks have been earning more on your savings.
[02:11:25.560 --> 02:11:27.160]   But are they giving that money back to you?
[02:11:27.160 --> 02:11:32.520]   According to the FDIC, the average US bank has only raised the rates they pay to you
[02:11:32.520 --> 02:11:36.800]   to 0.21% this year.
[02:11:36.800 --> 02:11:39.800]   0.21% this year.
[02:11:39.800 --> 02:11:43.920]   Wealthfront's actually offering their clients a rate that's almost 15 times higher with
[02:11:43.920 --> 02:11:46.040]   the Wealthfront cash account.
[02:11:46.040 --> 02:11:50.720]   It's easy to sign up, plus you'll get unlimited transfers that are completely fee-free and
[02:11:50.720 --> 02:11:56.480]   up to $2 million in FDIC insurance through partner banks.
[02:11:56.480 --> 02:11:59.480]   There are no account fees, no minimum balance.
[02:11:59.480 --> 02:12:04.000]   If you sign up at Wealthfront.com/twit right now, they're going to give you a free $50
[02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:06.680]   bonus with an initial deposit of $500.
[02:12:06.680 --> 02:12:08.880]   That's nice.
[02:12:08.880 --> 02:12:10.720]   So just one more reason to love Wealthfront.
[02:12:10.720 --> 02:12:13.360]   Don't let your bank keep the interest you could be earning.
[02:12:13.360 --> 02:12:19.880]   Move your savings to a high-heeled account like Wealthfront and earn 3.3% APY.
[02:12:19.880 --> 02:12:22.080]   That's pretty amazing.
[02:12:22.080 --> 02:12:26.560]   Join nearly half a million people who already use Wealthfront to earn 15 times more than
[02:12:26.560 --> 02:12:28.360]   the average US bank.
[02:12:28.360 --> 02:12:33.600]   Go to Wealthfront.com/twit to get started and get your free $50 bonus with an initial
[02:12:33.600 --> 02:12:36.680]   deposit of $500.
[02:12:36.680 --> 02:12:39.280]   Wealthfront.com/twit.
[02:12:39.280 --> 02:12:46.320]   Wealthfront.com/twit has been a paid endorsement for Wealthfront.
[02:12:46.320 --> 02:12:49.280]   And we thank you, Wealthfront, for your support here at Twit.
[02:12:49.280 --> 02:12:51.920]   And all of you who use that address are supporting us too.
[02:12:51.920 --> 02:12:52.920]   So thank you.
[02:12:52.920 --> 02:12:58.920]   What a week this week was we have a lovely handcrafted video for you describing all that
[02:12:58.920 --> 02:12:59.920]   you might have missed.
[02:12:59.920 --> 02:13:03.280]   This is a cozy little sweater.
[02:13:03.280 --> 02:13:10.000]   I bet it's got a happy holidays with a clippy and an okay button that's right over my left
[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:11.680]   breast.
[02:13:11.680 --> 02:13:13.280]   So girls stay away.
[02:13:13.280 --> 02:13:15.040]   Don't be tempted there.
[02:13:15.040 --> 02:13:16.640]   Previously on Twit.
[02:13:16.640 --> 02:13:18.840]   That's all about Andrew.
[02:13:18.840 --> 02:13:20.240]   Tell me if you've heard this before.
[02:13:20.240 --> 02:13:22.680]   I message on Android.
[02:13:22.680 --> 02:13:27.160]   Well there's a company called Sunbird.
[02:13:27.160 --> 02:13:34.840]   They claim set up a Vimesage in Sunbird only requires one, an Android phone and two,
[02:13:34.840 --> 02:13:36.320]   60 seconds of your time.
[02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:37.320]   Tech news weekly.
[02:13:37.320 --> 02:13:43.960]   I thought it would be great to sit down with chat GPT and have a little conversation.
[02:13:43.960 --> 02:13:47.760]   Can you write a pun-filled rhyming poem?
[02:13:47.760 --> 02:13:53.320]   Large language models are quite the feet with their ability to process and tweet.
[02:13:53.320 --> 02:13:59.800]   They've been trained on lots of data and can help you with any task or drama.
[02:13:59.800 --> 02:14:01.100]   Security now.
[02:14:01.100 --> 02:14:09.200]   The Virges coverage of anchors, UFI, IoT cameras, didn't not pull any punches.
[02:14:09.200 --> 02:14:15.840]   For super smart AI, apparently much better than their super dumb crypto, it analyzes your
[02:14:15.840 --> 02:14:22.440]   recorded footage without the need to risk your privacy by sending it to the cloud.
[02:14:22.440 --> 02:14:23.440]   Okay?
[02:14:23.440 --> 02:14:25.800]   Like all of this is untrue.
[02:14:25.800 --> 02:14:26.800]   Stunningly.
[02:14:26.800 --> 02:14:27.800]   Wow.
[02:14:27.800 --> 02:14:31.720]   In a TNO, trust no one world.
[02:14:31.720 --> 02:14:39.160]   The simple though impractical truth is, unless you designed it yourself, you don't.
[02:14:39.160 --> 02:14:45.880]   Don't know what it does to it, making the world safe for technology.
[02:14:45.880 --> 02:14:47.800]   What a fun week that was.
[02:14:47.800 --> 02:14:49.520]   Lots more still to come.
[02:14:49.520 --> 02:14:50.600]   It's going to be a great week.
[02:14:50.600 --> 02:14:57.560]   A reminder the way we're handling the holidays as usual means that because this year Christmas
[02:14:57.560 --> 02:15:00.320]   and New Year's Day are both on Sundays.
[02:15:00.320 --> 02:15:08.280]   So how we're going to do this is Christmas will have our holiday episode, which is going
[02:15:08.280 --> 02:15:10.480]   to feature the old timers.
[02:15:10.480 --> 02:15:17.160]   Jeff Jarvis, Paul Thorott, Steve Gibson, and Doc Serals, and me, we'll do a little fun
[02:15:17.160 --> 02:15:21.040]   kind of round table looking back at the year 2022.
[02:15:21.040 --> 02:15:23.840]   And then January 1st will be our best of episode.
[02:15:23.840 --> 02:15:27.880]   The week of January 27th for every other show will be our best of episode.
[02:15:27.880 --> 02:15:31.400]   So we can give this staff the last week of the year off.
[02:15:31.400 --> 02:15:37.040]   So best of episodes coming January 27th, the Twit holiday special January 20th.
[02:15:37.040 --> 02:15:45.840]   I'm sorry December 25th, I say January, December for both the best ofs and the holiday special.
[02:15:45.840 --> 02:15:49.200]   Very excited about that.
[02:15:49.200 --> 02:15:50.200]   Let's see.
[02:15:50.200 --> 02:15:56.240]   NASA awards a $57 million contract to build roads on the moon.
[02:15:56.240 --> 02:15:58.080]   The future is now.
[02:15:58.080 --> 02:15:59.600]   I'm very excited.
[02:15:59.600 --> 02:16:04.000]   This is a company you might have seen videos, TikToks, of them icon.
[02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:06.160]   It's an advanced construction technology.
[02:16:06.160 --> 02:16:09.480]   They do concrete 3D printed homes.
[02:16:09.480 --> 02:16:11.960]   Have you seen that extrusion machine?
[02:16:11.960 --> 02:16:15.080]   Yes, it's the way for the future.
[02:16:15.080 --> 02:16:18.880]   And also Orion Space capsule landed back on a day.
[02:16:18.880 --> 02:16:20.440]   Yes, Orion's home.
[02:16:20.440 --> 02:16:21.440]   Yep.
[02:16:21.440 --> 02:16:24.840]   After replicating a mission that America first cancelled carried out 54 years ago.
[02:16:24.840 --> 02:16:27.080]   Yeah, but just to show we can do it again.
[02:16:27.080 --> 02:16:28.080]   Yeah.
[02:16:28.080 --> 02:16:29.520]   We're older, we're wiser.
[02:16:29.520 --> 02:16:32.960]   No, Orion was very fun and very excited.
[02:16:32.960 --> 02:16:33.960]   Did you see?
[02:16:33.960 --> 02:16:38.400]   But the moon thing is just we're going to have to build that because you can't transport
[02:16:38.400 --> 02:16:39.400]   stuff that.
[02:16:39.400 --> 02:16:40.640]   You've got to build with the rock you've got.
[02:16:40.640 --> 02:16:44.600]   So they're using Regolith, Lunar Regolith to make this concrete.
[02:16:44.600 --> 02:16:47.120]   They'll use it for roads, habitats.
[02:16:47.120 --> 02:16:51.920]   They'll extrude the habitats with conduits already for wiring and piping.
[02:16:51.920 --> 02:16:56.240]   I think this is just $57 million is just to test it.
[02:16:56.240 --> 02:16:58.320]   But I think a really cool idea.
[02:16:58.320 --> 02:17:03.520]   So you were talking about Orion and Rod Pyle sent me a great...
[02:17:03.520 --> 02:17:06.400]   He was watching the Lockheed Martin video.
[02:17:06.400 --> 02:17:09.720]   Remember with Orion, you could say, "Oh, don't show it yet.
[02:17:09.720 --> 02:17:10.720]   Don't show it yet.
[02:17:10.720 --> 02:17:11.720]   Let me explain it first."
[02:17:11.720 --> 02:17:17.080]   You could send a message that would be displayed on the iPad in the Orion capsule.
[02:17:17.080 --> 02:17:24.160]   This was a joint venture with Lockheed Martin and Amazon Echo Division and WebEx.
[02:17:24.160 --> 02:17:25.720]   And so they would have to approve it.
[02:17:25.720 --> 02:17:29.840]   Obviously, you couldn't send spam up there or anything like that.
[02:17:29.840 --> 02:17:30.840]   They'd have to approve it.
[02:17:30.840 --> 02:17:35.600]   But obviously, somebody at Lockheed Martin has a sense of humor because they did accept
[02:17:35.600 --> 02:17:42.200]   this message at 264,883 miles away from the Earth.
[02:17:42.200 --> 02:17:44.280]   Now you can show it, Benito.
[02:17:44.280 --> 02:17:50.280]   We've been trying to reach you about your spacecraft's extended warranty sent by Blocked.
[02:17:50.280 --> 02:17:55.240]   I thought it was going to be hot singles in your area with zero temperature outside.
[02:17:55.240 --> 02:17:57.240]   They did block all of those.
[02:17:57.240 --> 02:18:02.000]   But I think they must have realized this is actually pretty funny.
[02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:04.600]   So, nice job, somebody.
[02:18:04.600 --> 02:18:08.120]   Anybody who submitted that would have thought there's no way this is getting through.
[02:18:08.120 --> 02:18:09.280]   It did.
[02:18:09.280 --> 02:18:10.280]   It did.
[02:18:10.280 --> 02:18:11.280]   Well done.
[02:18:11.280 --> 02:18:12.280]   Let's see.
[02:18:12.280 --> 02:18:13.280]   What else?
[02:18:13.280 --> 02:18:16.880]   Just the bottom of the barrel on these stories.
[02:18:16.880 --> 02:18:24.920]   San Francisco, we're happy to report, has decided not to authorize explosive killer robots.
[02:18:24.920 --> 02:18:26.560]   Yes, yes indeed.
[02:18:26.560 --> 02:18:27.560]   Thank goodness.
[02:18:27.560 --> 02:18:29.920]   You won't could say they've terminated the plan, Andy.
[02:18:29.920 --> 02:18:31.760]   Last week we reported that.
[02:18:31.760 --> 02:18:34.520]   I heard that grown.
[02:18:34.520 --> 02:18:36.480]   This is a citizen.
[02:18:36.480 --> 02:18:38.920]   Back to your homes.
[02:18:38.920 --> 02:18:43.960]   Last week had approved the idea of using the, this is military technology.
[02:18:43.960 --> 02:18:48.120]   So it has to have the approval of the supervisors that the San Francisco Police Department could
[02:18:48.120 --> 02:18:53.720]   use these 17 bomb disposal robots.
[02:18:53.720 --> 02:18:59.520]   And it could empower them with lethal force if there were no other way around.
[02:18:59.520 --> 02:19:01.720]   But not guns, only explosives.
[02:19:01.720 --> 02:19:04.000]   That was the wild thing, just like a bomb.
[02:19:04.000 --> 02:19:05.880]   So it could just go in there and blow the bad guy.
[02:19:05.880 --> 02:19:07.240]   I mean, that's been done already.
[02:19:07.240 --> 02:19:12.480]   Dallas in 2016, they killed a, there was a guy who shot, what is it, five or six police
[02:19:12.480 --> 02:19:13.480]   officers.
[02:19:13.480 --> 02:19:14.920]   They got them cornered into a building.
[02:19:14.920 --> 02:19:19.320]   They basically grabbed some explosives, put it on the front of a police robot, drove it
[02:19:19.320 --> 02:19:20.480]   up to them and blew them up.
[02:19:20.480 --> 02:19:22.440]   Yeah, actually, honestly, I don't think it's such a bad idea.
[02:19:22.440 --> 02:19:27.480]   I think that O'Valdi, the police weren't willing to go in and save those kids, send a button.
[02:19:27.480 --> 02:19:28.920]   Oh, no, I guess you couldn't send a bomb.
[02:19:28.920 --> 02:19:30.760]   No, you can't send a bomb into school.
[02:19:30.760 --> 02:19:33.040]   That's not, no.
[02:19:33.040 --> 02:19:37.400]   And there, ladies and gentlemen, is my beef with this idea because we'll get a little
[02:19:37.400 --> 02:19:38.400]   ambitious with it.
[02:19:38.400 --> 02:19:41.400]   Also, can I just ask, what did they think people were going to say?
[02:19:41.400 --> 02:19:42.400]   Oh, yeah, it sounds great.
[02:19:42.400 --> 02:19:43.400]   Yeah.
[02:19:43.400 --> 02:19:44.400]   Let's do that.
[02:19:44.400 --> 02:19:45.400]   Yeah.
[02:19:45.400 --> 02:19:46.400]   Let's give the SFPD robot bombs.
[02:19:46.400 --> 02:19:50.360]   This is it in a few very, very tiny circumstances.
[02:19:50.360 --> 02:19:54.240]   This makes sense, which would happen maybe once every five or 10 years.
[02:19:54.240 --> 02:19:55.640]   I think people are right here.
[02:19:55.640 --> 02:19:56.640]   You know the air is afraid of abuse.
[02:19:56.640 --> 02:20:00.560]   Yeah, afraid of abuse by an over-eater police department.
[02:20:00.560 --> 02:20:01.560]   What could go wrong?
[02:20:01.560 --> 02:20:03.360]   What could possibly go wrong?
[02:20:03.360 --> 02:20:04.360]   Like it go wrong.
[02:20:04.360 --> 02:20:06.520]   It's going to make the killer robots.
[02:20:06.520 --> 02:20:10.040]   Did you know, everybody, that we have a military here in the United States that has
[02:20:10.040 --> 02:20:11.840]   bombs and things to blow things up?
[02:20:11.840 --> 02:20:14.360]   We don't need to give the cops robot bombs.
[02:20:14.360 --> 02:20:15.360]   We have a military.
[02:20:15.360 --> 02:20:16.640]   Yeah, they can just bomb the guns.
[02:20:16.640 --> 02:20:18.520]   They call the army, have the army do it.
[02:20:18.520 --> 02:20:19.520]   Yeah.
[02:20:19.520 --> 02:20:22.840]   They call the Marines Air Force, Air National Guard, Seapatrol, whatever.
[02:20:22.840 --> 02:20:25.880]   Another story from the register.
[02:20:25.880 --> 02:20:28.440]   It's the end of an area you ever flown a 747.
[02:20:28.440 --> 02:20:32.920]   The last 747 rolls off the production line.
[02:20:32.920 --> 02:20:33.920]   And I like Brandon.
[02:20:33.920 --> 02:20:38.320]   I don't know if Brandon wrote this or you did he on Boeing, Boeing gone.
[02:20:38.320 --> 02:20:40.120]   Actually, that was Chris, my editor.
[02:20:40.120 --> 02:20:41.120]   Nice job.
[02:20:41.120 --> 02:20:43.120]   Yeah, he's the class on.
[02:20:43.120 --> 02:20:47.240]   It really did feel like, because I mean, I've flown 747s ever since I've been flying.
[02:20:47.240 --> 02:20:48.240]   Love them.
[02:20:48.240 --> 02:20:53.000]   It's, that's the one that had the piano lounge upstairs.
[02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:54.000]   Oh, yeah.
[02:20:54.000 --> 02:20:55.840]   Very first versions.
[02:20:55.840 --> 02:21:00.600]   Remember that they had ads that they'd have people standing around at a bar and playing
[02:21:00.600 --> 02:21:02.400]   piano and singing on the airplane?
[02:21:02.400 --> 02:21:07.040]   Oh, if you look at the 1970s and 60s and 72 stuff, they were just like, yeah, they've
[02:21:07.040 --> 02:21:09.400]   got a bar, they've got a piano.
[02:21:09.400 --> 02:21:11.400]   Now it's just more seats, more money, more money.
[02:21:11.400 --> 02:21:15.440]   Well, I don't know, Virgin still has a bar on the some of the 747s.
[02:21:15.440 --> 02:21:16.440]   Yeah.
[02:21:16.440 --> 02:21:19.840]   I like sitting upstairs on a 747.
[02:21:19.840 --> 02:21:21.760]   It's kind of a smaller little.
[02:21:21.760 --> 02:21:24.840]   Yeah, but the luggage racks are much smaller.
[02:21:24.840 --> 02:21:26.640]   Ah, sorry.
[02:21:26.640 --> 02:21:28.600]   I was a aviation journalist for years.
[02:21:28.600 --> 02:21:30.560]   Spent a lot of time in the 747.
[02:21:30.560 --> 02:21:31.560]   Yeah.
[02:21:31.560 --> 02:21:34.920]   It's the 1574th plane.
[02:21:34.920 --> 02:21:37.000]   Be the last one assembled.
[02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:40.360]   They will still likely stay in service for at least another decade or two.
[02:21:40.360 --> 02:21:41.360]   Oh, a couple of these.
[02:21:41.360 --> 02:21:42.360]   Don't wear out.
[02:21:42.360 --> 02:21:43.360]   Yeah.
[02:21:43.360 --> 02:21:50.960]   And the final craft is a 747-8 freighter, which will be delivered to the cargo company Atlas
[02:21:50.960 --> 02:21:53.440]   Air in early 2023.
[02:21:53.440 --> 02:21:54.440]   Yeah.
[02:21:54.440 --> 02:21:55.440]   It's...
[02:21:55.440 --> 02:21:57.720]   And in the line, now we have 777s, which are reasonable.
[02:21:57.720 --> 02:21:58.720]   777s are good.
[02:21:58.720 --> 02:22:00.720]   I mean, I flew the A380 the last time.
[02:22:00.720 --> 02:22:02.200]   Well, obviously, the A380.
[02:22:02.200 --> 02:22:03.360]   Isn't that too big though?
[02:22:03.360 --> 02:22:05.800]   I mean, most airports can't even handle it.
[02:22:05.800 --> 02:22:06.960]   Yeah, this is it.
[02:22:06.960 --> 02:22:07.960]   It's kind of like Concord.
[02:22:07.960 --> 02:22:10.280]   It's limited to certain routes.
[02:22:10.280 --> 02:22:14.800]   We flew an A380 out of San Francisco and half the plane boards upstairs and half the
[02:22:14.800 --> 02:22:18.880]   downstairs is the boarding is on two different levels of the airport because it's such a
[02:22:18.880 --> 02:22:19.880]   big...
[02:22:19.880 --> 02:22:20.880]   It's crazy.
[02:22:20.880 --> 02:22:25.520]   Well, some of the luxury ones, God Virgin Airways did this horrible advertising campaign
[02:22:25.520 --> 02:22:32.280]   when they got the A380 because they put double bed cabins in the upper deck and a casino.
[02:22:32.280 --> 02:22:33.280]   No!
[02:22:33.280 --> 02:22:34.680]   That's awesome!
[02:22:34.680 --> 02:22:35.680]   Yeah.
[02:22:35.680 --> 02:22:41.400]   Richard Branson's cheeky, smoky comment to the news was, "Now you can get lucky twice
[02:22:41.400 --> 02:22:42.400]   on a Virgin plane."
[02:22:42.400 --> 02:22:43.400]   Oh, oh, please.
[02:22:43.400 --> 02:22:45.400]   And it was just like, "Oh, for goodness."
[02:22:45.400 --> 02:22:46.400]   Oh, my geez!
[02:22:46.400 --> 02:22:47.400]   That's a lot of respect.
[02:22:47.400 --> 02:22:50.600]   That's the last thing that should happen on an airplane with other people.
[02:22:50.600 --> 02:22:55.800]   Here's the Emirates first-class shower spa on an A380, just for you.
[02:22:55.800 --> 02:22:57.760]   Honestly, I'm gonna say...
[02:22:57.760 --> 02:22:58.760]   That's depressing.
[02:22:58.760 --> 02:22:59.760]   Yeah.
[02:22:59.760 --> 02:23:00.760]   It's kind of depressing.
[02:23:00.760 --> 02:23:05.600]   I'm gonna say, I think it's Sarah Millican said this, so we're gonna say, "Oh, I'm gonna
[02:23:05.600 --> 02:23:06.600]   see you later in the year."
[02:23:06.600 --> 02:23:10.520]   And she's just like, "People talk about the Mile High Club as though it's something...
[02:23:10.520 --> 02:23:11.520]   It's not exhausting."
[02:23:11.520 --> 02:23:12.520]   No, that's not...
[02:23:12.520 --> 02:23:14.280]   No, you just had sex in the chemical toilet.
[02:23:14.280 --> 02:23:15.280]   Yeah.
[02:23:15.280 --> 02:23:16.280]   You don't really...
[02:23:16.280 --> 02:23:17.280]   It's not a non-clamory...
[02:23:17.280 --> 02:23:18.280]   It's highly overrated.
[02:23:18.280 --> 02:23:21.640]   And I'm not speaking of somebody who's had an experience of it.
[02:23:21.640 --> 02:23:22.640]   I haven't.
[02:23:22.640 --> 02:23:23.640]   Absolutely.
[02:23:23.640 --> 02:23:26.080]   Absolutely not.
[02:23:26.080 --> 02:23:33.720]   Final story, the Oxford Word of the Year, I actually was voting for Metaverse, which
[02:23:33.720 --> 02:23:35.480]   is not yet in the Oxford English Dictionary.
[02:23:35.480 --> 02:23:45.320]   I thought that's a shoo-in, but no, the public vote, 93% voted for something I had never heard
[02:23:45.320 --> 02:23:46.320]   of.
[02:23:46.320 --> 02:23:47.320]   Goblin mode.
[02:23:47.320 --> 02:23:49.600]   I've never heard of that.
[02:23:49.600 --> 02:23:50.600]   What is that?
[02:23:50.600 --> 02:23:53.400]   Well, I mean, Leo, do you have the story, Paul?
[02:23:53.400 --> 02:23:55.840]   Because the actual definition is better than I can do myself.
[02:23:55.840 --> 02:23:56.840]   Yes.
[02:23:56.840 --> 02:23:57.840]   This is from the Atlantic.
[02:23:57.840 --> 02:24:05.280]   Oxford defines Goblin mode as a type of behavior, which is unapologetically self-indudgeon
[02:24:05.280 --> 02:24:14.680]   indulgent, lazy, slovenly, or greedy, typically in a way that rejects norms or expectations.
[02:24:14.680 --> 02:24:15.680]   Yes.
[02:24:15.680 --> 02:24:20.520]   So Goblin mode is, for example, when you take your roommates' food and you sit on the couch
[02:24:20.520 --> 02:24:24.400]   in Wisconsin blankets all day and refuse to wash your socks because you're going to
[02:24:24.400 --> 02:24:25.520]   Goblin mode.
[02:24:25.520 --> 02:24:30.000]   And it's what we all retreated to in the early COVID days before we realized this was going
[02:24:30.000 --> 02:24:33.760]   to be a multi-year incarceration in our domiciles.
[02:24:33.760 --> 02:24:38.200]   And I think it's actually kind of the extreme version of self-care because it's a little
[02:24:38.200 --> 02:24:40.040]   bit selfish and a little bit greedy.
[02:24:40.040 --> 02:24:41.280]   And I adore it.
[02:24:41.280 --> 02:24:43.480]   And this is what weekends are for.
[02:24:43.480 --> 02:24:46.160]   And I go Goblin mode as often as I can.
[02:24:46.160 --> 02:24:47.160]   It's fantastic.
[02:24:47.160 --> 02:24:48.160]   I can recommend it.
[02:24:48.160 --> 02:24:49.160]   Do it.
[02:24:49.160 --> 02:24:50.160]   This is what the Atlantic wrote.
[02:24:50.160 --> 02:24:57.080]   "The ability to go Goblin mode was a necessary evolution forged in trauma, but it now remains
[02:24:57.080 --> 02:25:02.880]   with us as a superpower as we emerge from our caves after that long hibernation.
[02:25:02.880 --> 02:25:10.480]   For Goblin selves lurk somewhere deep inside us beckoning us back home to vibe out."
[02:25:10.480 --> 02:25:11.480]   Yeah.
[02:25:11.480 --> 02:25:12.680]   Mine's not that hidden.
[02:25:12.680 --> 02:25:15.280]   Mine's kind of right at surface level.
[02:25:15.280 --> 02:25:18.600]   Whenever people are like put on pants, I'm like, I don't know, man.
[02:25:18.600 --> 02:25:21.080]   I haven't worn hard pants in a long time.
[02:25:21.080 --> 02:25:22.080]   You know?
[02:25:22.080 --> 02:25:23.800]   You know, I was wrong.
[02:25:23.800 --> 02:25:29.480]   You know, Denise Howell said on our Macedon put the three words.
[02:25:29.480 --> 02:25:31.200]   One was metaverse.
[02:25:31.200 --> 02:25:32.360]   One was Goblin mode.
[02:25:32.360 --> 02:25:35.960]   And I came around with the third one was.
[02:25:35.960 --> 02:25:40.720]   And I said, oh, metaverse is just an I don't even know a Goblin.
[02:25:40.720 --> 02:25:43.520]   Everybody shouted me down and said, what?
[02:25:43.520 --> 02:25:47.400]   Everybody knows Goblin mode.
[02:25:47.400 --> 02:25:49.200]   Maybe I'm on wit about this.
[02:25:49.200 --> 02:25:50.960]   The other one, by the way, was hashtag.
[02:25:50.960 --> 02:25:54.000]   This one is definitely not a starter.
[02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.600]   Non-starter hashtag I stand with.
[02:25:56.600 --> 02:25:57.600]   No.
[02:25:57.600 --> 02:25:58.600]   What?
[02:25:58.600 --> 02:25:59.600]   That's not a word of the year?
[02:25:59.600 --> 02:26:00.600]   No.
[02:26:00.600 --> 02:26:01.680]   Metaverse is a word of the year.
[02:26:01.680 --> 02:26:03.840]   I don't like it, but it's a word of the year.
[02:26:03.840 --> 02:26:07.200]   It's a word that's going to be used again and again over the next decade.
[02:26:07.200 --> 02:26:09.400]   How often are we going to use Goblin mode?
[02:26:09.400 --> 02:26:10.400]   I just don't know.
[02:26:10.400 --> 02:26:12.400]   I've just done a whole segment about it.
[02:26:12.400 --> 02:26:13.400]   So several times back.
[02:26:13.400 --> 02:26:17.000]   I'm just going to be talking about it one more time.
[02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:21.360]   It's only a matter of time before there's in a Goblin mode emoji now, right?
[02:26:21.360 --> 02:26:29.600]   I think that the idea of investing a little bit more in what makes you happy versus going
[02:26:29.600 --> 02:26:34.240]   out in the world and doing performative things for the sake of being part of norms
[02:26:34.240 --> 02:26:38.040]   is the underlying tension that makes Goblin mode interesting to me.
[02:26:38.040 --> 02:26:43.040]   And I think as I try to relearn how to be social and so forth, I think I'm just a fundamentally
[02:26:43.040 --> 02:26:46.480]   different person and I'm a bit more Goblin mode-esque than I was pre-COVID.
[02:26:46.480 --> 02:26:51.480]   I think this is so great that you're saying this because you're just about to have a Goblin
[02:26:51.480 --> 02:26:53.440]   who's going to take all your Goblin mode.
[02:26:53.440 --> 02:26:54.920]   Oh, so true.
[02:26:54.920 --> 02:26:55.920]   So true.
[02:26:55.920 --> 02:26:57.680]   No more Goblin mode for you.
[02:26:57.680 --> 02:27:00.920]   I'm trying to do as much self-indulgent crap as I can.
[02:27:00.920 --> 02:27:01.920]   Oh my God.
[02:27:01.920 --> 02:27:02.920]   Liza and I went to the library today.
[02:27:02.920 --> 02:27:03.920]   We read books by the fire.
[02:27:03.920 --> 02:27:08.240]   We're trying to do all this pleasant stuff because we know in some number of hours-
[02:27:08.240 --> 02:27:13.880]   You'll be serving an infant Goblin for the next 18 to 30 years.
[02:27:13.880 --> 02:27:19.200]   I don't know if you found this, Alex, but your friends with kids for years have been
[02:27:19.200 --> 02:27:20.840]   telling you, "Oh, it's so fulfilling.
[02:27:20.840 --> 02:27:23.000]   It's the most wonderful thing you can ever do."
[02:27:23.000 --> 02:27:26.680]   And then when you announce the pregnancy, you're never going to sleep again.
[02:27:26.680 --> 02:27:30.440]   This was the most ridiculous thing because everyone was like, "Oh my gosh, you guys are
[02:27:30.440 --> 02:27:31.440]   going to be such lovely parents.
[02:27:31.440 --> 02:27:32.440]   We're so excited."
[02:27:32.440 --> 02:27:37.480]   And then the moment we actually be in a fertility journey, when we were finally pregnant, they're
[02:27:37.480 --> 02:27:39.680]   like, "Hey, welcome to Hell, kid."
[02:27:39.680 --> 02:27:43.680]   And I was like, "I feel vaguely tricked by this."
[02:27:43.680 --> 02:27:44.680]   No, no.
[02:27:44.680 --> 02:27:45.680]   It's wonderful.
[02:27:45.680 --> 02:27:46.680]   You are going to love it.
[02:27:46.680 --> 02:27:49.680]   You're going to love that baby more than you loved anything ever in your life.
[02:27:49.680 --> 02:27:51.160]   And I'm looking forward to it.
[02:27:51.160 --> 02:27:55.440]   But I will say, when I come back on Twitter next time, let's go for like seven hours because
[02:27:55.440 --> 02:27:59.080]   it's going to be after I'm done with parental leave and I'm going to like--
[02:27:59.080 --> 02:28:01.360]   Yeah, it will be a while from now.
[02:28:01.360 --> 02:28:02.360]   Yeah.
[02:28:02.360 --> 02:28:03.360]   You didn't mean that good.
[02:28:03.360 --> 02:28:04.920]   I know I've seen this happen to Vindra Harderwar.
[02:28:04.920 --> 02:28:07.480]   I've seen it happen again and again to our hosts.
[02:28:07.480 --> 02:28:10.680]   You are on for the last time for some time.
[02:28:10.680 --> 02:28:11.680]   You know what?
[02:28:11.680 --> 02:28:12.680]   I'm ready though.
[02:28:12.680 --> 02:28:13.680]   I'm ready for the next stage of life.
[02:28:13.680 --> 02:28:14.680]   This is going to be fun.
[02:28:14.680 --> 02:28:15.680]   We're going to have a couple of kids.
[02:28:15.680 --> 02:28:16.680]   And you know what?
[02:28:16.680 --> 02:28:17.680]   They were right.
[02:28:17.680 --> 02:28:18.680]   You two are going to be fantastic parents.
[02:28:18.680 --> 02:28:20.240]   I'm very, very happy for both of you.
[02:28:20.240 --> 02:28:23.240]   You should see all the cute hats we own for this baby.
[02:28:23.240 --> 02:28:26.400]   He's going to be the most-- people send us so many onesies.
[02:28:26.400 --> 02:28:29.000]   We have like math onesies from our math friends.
[02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:31.080]   It's going to be-- we're so excited.
[02:28:31.080 --> 02:28:32.080]   I'm not sure.
[02:28:32.080 --> 02:28:33.080]   But not yet.
[02:28:33.080 --> 02:28:34.080]   A couple of days.
[02:28:34.080 --> 02:28:37.720]   I wish Microsoft still did these because I had 771.
[02:28:37.720 --> 02:28:39.120]   But I got one for a friend of mine.
[02:28:39.120 --> 02:28:44.360]   I was up at the Redmond campus for what, the 2008 server launch.
[02:28:44.360 --> 02:28:50.120]   And in the Microsoft shop, they had baby onesies, clipping on the front with-- it looks like
[02:28:50.120 --> 02:28:51.120]   you're having a baby.
[02:28:51.120 --> 02:28:52.120]   Can I help you?
[02:28:52.120 --> 02:28:53.120]   Oh, God.
[02:28:53.120 --> 02:28:54.120]   I wish they still did.
[02:28:54.120 --> 02:28:56.120]   I wish they would have said you wanted to call me.
[02:28:56.120 --> 02:28:57.120]   I wish they still did.
[02:28:57.120 --> 02:28:58.120]   I wish they would have said you wanted to call me.
[02:28:58.120 --> 02:28:59.120]   Let me tell you that I experienced joke onesies are not a good idea.
[02:28:59.120 --> 02:29:00.120]   Oh, really?
[02:29:00.120 --> 02:29:01.120]   Yeah, I don't recommend it.
[02:29:01.120 --> 02:29:02.120]   Oh, OK.
[02:29:02.120 --> 02:29:03.120]   What's the problem?
[02:29:03.120 --> 02:29:05.120]   Just-- you wear it once and then, you know.
[02:29:05.120 --> 02:29:06.120]   OK.
[02:29:06.120 --> 02:29:07.120]   The joke west then.
[02:29:07.120 --> 02:29:08.120]   The joke west then.
[02:29:08.120 --> 02:29:09.120]   I mean, we--
[02:29:09.120 --> 02:29:11.120]   I mean, we-- we have a lot of joke onesies.
[02:29:11.120 --> 02:29:14.560]   The problem is we have so much clothes for like zero to three months, three to six to
[02:29:14.560 --> 02:29:15.560]   nine.
[02:29:15.560 --> 02:29:17.440]   And then after that, like clothes aren't as cute.
[02:29:17.440 --> 02:29:18.880]   So people don't buy them for you.
[02:29:18.880 --> 02:29:19.880]   Yeah.
[02:29:19.880 --> 02:29:20.880]   For your--
[02:29:20.880 --> 02:29:21.880]   Shower you.
[02:29:21.880 --> 02:29:24.720]   You'll be on the handyman down train.
[02:29:24.720 --> 02:29:25.720]   That is a very real thing.
[02:29:25.720 --> 02:29:26.720]   Hand me downs.
[02:29:26.720 --> 02:29:27.720]   They're a lifesaver.
[02:29:27.720 --> 02:29:28.720]   Yeah.
[02:29:28.720 --> 02:29:31.160]   My friends in town had one kid and stopped.
[02:29:31.160 --> 02:29:32.560]   And because they just wanted to have one.
[02:29:32.560 --> 02:29:33.720]   And so they gave us a bunch of their steps.
[02:29:33.720 --> 02:29:36.240]   So my baby Bjorn that we have is from them.
[02:29:36.240 --> 02:29:38.800]   And we have a little mini bathtub for her.
[02:29:38.800 --> 02:29:40.440]   And so yeah, we've been hitting that up.
[02:29:40.440 --> 02:29:45.040]   But like, I just-- I'm curious to see how hard this is.
[02:29:45.040 --> 02:29:47.480]   Because my wife's a doctor.
[02:29:47.480 --> 02:29:49.240]   We have family nearby.
[02:29:49.240 --> 02:29:50.680]   We are super prepped.
[02:29:50.680 --> 02:29:52.360]   We're going to be in great shape.
[02:29:52.360 --> 02:29:53.360]   And Connie--
[02:29:53.360 --> 02:29:54.360]   I'm telling people a lot.
[02:29:54.360 --> 02:29:59.160]   Connie may not know this, but this baby's nursery is in my mom's former weaving room.
[02:29:59.160 --> 02:30:00.160]   Yeah.
[02:30:00.160 --> 02:30:01.160]   Oh, that's great.
[02:30:01.160 --> 02:30:06.320]   They live in my childhood house where I grew up.
[02:30:06.320 --> 02:30:08.080]   Total coincidence.
[02:30:08.080 --> 02:30:10.440]   So I know very well, I went this summer.
[02:30:10.440 --> 02:30:11.440]   I visited.
[02:30:11.440 --> 02:30:13.760]   I saw where the nursery is going to be.
[02:30:13.760 --> 02:30:15.360]   It's-- I-- this is thrilled.
[02:30:15.360 --> 02:30:16.880]   I asked-- did I tell you this Alex?
[02:30:16.880 --> 02:30:17.880]   I asked my mom.
[02:30:17.880 --> 02:30:20.640]   I said, did you know there was a stair up into the attic from your weaving room?
[02:30:20.640 --> 02:30:21.640]   She said no there wasn't.
[02:30:21.640 --> 02:30:22.640]   I said, yes there was.
[02:30:22.640 --> 02:30:24.440]   I raised-- there is.
[02:30:24.440 --> 02:30:25.440]   I saw it.
[02:30:25.440 --> 02:30:26.760]   She said, no, no, no.
[02:30:26.760 --> 02:30:27.760]   I said, yeah.
[02:30:27.760 --> 02:30:31.320]   That's where she put all her wool, so she probably never saw the stairs.
[02:30:31.320 --> 02:30:36.160]   That is now a repository for all the really beautiful dresses we have for Aida.
[02:30:36.160 --> 02:30:40.480]   Like all of Liza's childhood, baby clothes for mom saved.
[02:30:40.480 --> 02:30:44.160]   And so we have like this amazing, breath new attire for this child.
[02:30:44.160 --> 02:30:47.600]   Everything from heavy metal onesies to like frilly dresses.
[02:30:47.600 --> 02:30:48.840]   This gets good on everything.
[02:30:48.840 --> 02:30:49.840]   It's going to be great.
[02:30:49.840 --> 02:30:55.400]   And then that house from the age about, I'd say, six or seven to the age of 14.
[02:30:55.400 --> 02:30:58.640]   I'm still slightly freaked out by the concept of a weaving room, to be honest.
[02:30:58.640 --> 02:30:59.640]   Well, she was a weaver.
[02:30:59.640 --> 02:31:00.640]   That was right.
[02:31:00.640 --> 02:31:01.640]   Okay.
[02:31:01.640 --> 02:31:04.320]   Which meant I wore a lot of scratchy wool punches.
[02:31:04.320 --> 02:31:05.320]   No.
[02:31:05.320 --> 02:31:06.320]   All right.
[02:31:06.320 --> 02:31:07.440]   Thank you so much, Alex.
[02:31:07.440 --> 02:31:11.120]   All the best to you and Liza have a-- I'm glad you made it through the show without an
[02:31:11.120 --> 02:31:12.960]   emergency.
[02:31:12.960 --> 02:31:14.920]   Go take good care of her.
[02:31:14.920 --> 02:31:18.920]   Her feet are swollen and she's tired and she's ready to have a baby.
[02:31:18.920 --> 02:31:19.920]   And you're going to have a woman.
[02:31:19.920 --> 02:31:22.920]   She's ready to be done being pregnant and we're ready to hold the kids.
[02:31:22.920 --> 02:31:23.920]   So I will see her walk.
[02:31:23.920 --> 02:31:24.920]   So happy for you, Alex.
[02:31:24.920 --> 02:31:27.320]   And put family in like March and we'll see.
[02:31:27.320 --> 02:31:28.320]   Yeah, we'll see.
[02:31:28.320 --> 02:31:30.240]   Good luck rushing fingers and toes for you, man.
[02:31:30.240 --> 02:31:31.240]   Yeah.
[02:31:31.240 --> 02:31:33.640]   Crunch plus editor in chief, Alex Wilhelm.
[02:31:33.640 --> 02:31:34.800]   Thank you, Ian.
[02:31:34.800 --> 02:31:35.800]   So great.
[02:31:35.800 --> 02:31:37.760]   Of course, as always, I have even Thompson in here.
[02:31:37.760 --> 02:31:43.480]   US editor at the register.com, our expert in all things English.
[02:31:43.480 --> 02:31:48.000]   And he's actually Scottish, which is why I gave him Irish whiskey and that's confusing
[02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:48.840]   as hell.
[02:31:48.840 --> 02:31:50.840]   Honestly, it's whiskey, who cares?
[02:31:50.840 --> 02:31:53.400]   I hope you have a wonderful holiday.
[02:31:53.400 --> 02:31:54.400]   And you too.
[02:31:54.400 --> 02:31:56.080]   And my love to you and Monica, both.
[02:31:56.080 --> 02:31:57.080]   And to you and Liza.
[02:31:57.080 --> 02:31:58.080]   Take care.
[02:31:58.080 --> 02:31:59.560]   Connie Goodyelmo, you're wonderful.
[02:31:59.560 --> 02:32:03.800]   We always love having you on editor in chief at CNET where you're working hard on you.
[02:32:03.800 --> 02:32:05.120]   When do you get to take off some time?
[02:32:05.120 --> 02:32:06.120]   I hope soon.
[02:32:06.120 --> 02:32:10.440]   I hope so too next week, the week after Christmas.
[02:32:10.440 --> 02:32:12.800]   Yeah, take that week off.
[02:32:12.800 --> 02:32:16.280]   Enjoy and have a very nice holiday.
[02:32:16.280 --> 02:32:17.760]   It was wonderful having you.
[02:32:17.760 --> 02:32:18.760]   Thank you.
[02:32:18.760 --> 02:32:19.760]   Mary Hone days, everyone.
[02:32:19.760 --> 02:32:21.840]   Mary Hone days.
[02:32:21.840 --> 02:32:22.840]   Thank you all for being here.
[02:32:22.840 --> 02:32:24.960]   We do Twitter every Sunday.
[02:32:24.960 --> 02:32:28.800]   2 p.m. Pacific 5 p.m. Eastern time.
[02:32:28.800 --> 02:32:30.040]   That's 2,200 UTC.
[02:32:30.040 --> 02:32:34.280]   You can, I say that because you can watch this live if you want live.twit.tv.
[02:32:34.280 --> 02:32:36.200]   We stream audio and video there.
[02:32:36.200 --> 02:32:37.960]   People watching live often like to chat with us.
[02:32:37.960 --> 02:32:39.560]   You could do that in our IRC.
[02:32:39.560 --> 02:32:43.080]   That's open to all IRC.twit.tv.
[02:32:43.080 --> 02:32:48.840]   Also great to chat with us in our Discord which is a lovely place to hang out with all
[02:32:48.840 --> 02:32:51.520]   the other club Twit members.
[02:32:51.520 --> 02:32:55.720]   Please join us there.
[02:32:55.720 --> 02:32:57.720]   That's Goblin Mode, I believe.
[02:32:57.720 --> 02:32:59.160]   Right there.
[02:32:59.160 --> 02:33:01.880]   You can also watch the show after the fact.
[02:33:01.880 --> 02:33:06.080]   Download a copy from our website, twit.tv or watch it on YouTube.
[02:33:06.080 --> 02:33:11.040]   There's a video, actually most of the shows have dedicated YouTube channels.
[02:33:11.040 --> 02:33:12.040]   There's video there.
[02:33:12.040 --> 02:33:15.880]   You can watch a good way to share video too with people if you want to clip out something
[02:33:15.880 --> 02:33:17.520]   and send it off to a friend.
[02:33:17.520 --> 02:33:20.680]   And of course the easiest thing to do is subscribe and your favorite podcast player and that
[02:33:20.680 --> 02:33:22.320]   way you'll get it immediately.
[02:33:22.320 --> 02:33:27.120]   The moment it's available so you have it in time for your Monday morning commute.
[02:33:27.120 --> 02:33:31.040]   Wherever it is you go on Monday morning.
[02:33:31.040 --> 02:33:32.360]   Thank you all for being here.
[02:33:32.360 --> 02:33:33.880]   We'll see you next time.
[02:33:33.880 --> 02:33:34.880]   Another Twit.
[02:33:34.880 --> 02:33:35.880]   It's in the can.
[02:33:35.880 --> 02:33:36.880]   Bye bye everybody.
[02:33:36.880 --> 02:33:45.640]   See you next time.
[02:33:45.640 --> 02:33:46.480]   Alright.
