[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Did I get that right?
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   I have no idea.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Some huge number.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Obama is now just 78,000.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Hey, Kevin, you mentioned me again.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   I need a few more people.

[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Or Mitch on Twitter?
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Mitch on Twitter.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   I don't care about here.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   If you haven't even friended me up on Twitter, John, I'm hurt.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   That's not true.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Are you sure?
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   I don't think we're friends.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Uh-oh.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   That's true.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   I think John might not follow me on Twitter too, and he follows
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Tom, which hurts me.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Wow.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   That hurts.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   I'll be right back.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   You're leaving already?
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   You're leaving already?
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   She's hurt.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   You heard her.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   John, I blame you for this.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   I follow Molliwood.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   M-O-L-L-Y.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   W-O-O-D.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   She is, of course, the most abuzz out loud.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   I follow Kevin Rose, and I follow the real Devorak.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   But Molli, you're only following 51 people.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   You're very, uh...
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Yeah, you're the one that's bad.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   You're a bad person.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   No, she's discriminating.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   I know I...
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   I recently learned that that was not cool at all.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Oh, no.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   According to the rules, the rules of the Internet.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   The rules of Twitter.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Who knows the rules are?
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   But if you follow so many people, then you can't...
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   I don't know.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   I like to be able to actually keep track of what's happening.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   I'm happy to.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   It breaks it as a utility.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   It makes sense.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   I think it does.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   It's just chaos.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Oh, bull.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Kevin, I was sorry we didn't get...
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Kevin follows 102 people.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   How was that bull?
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   How could you keep track of how do you actually get a cohesive thread out of like 13,000 people?
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   You don't.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   And even...
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   It's like we got an awful party.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   For a long time, Scoble said, "Oh, you have to follow everybody who follows you."
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   And then even he admitted, "No, it's broken."
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   And left.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   So then I broke it.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Yeah, but it's not broken.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   It's just...
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   It's basically...
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   It's basically...
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   It's Leo, because Leo's bailed out.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   He hates Twitter because that's the name "Twit."
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Well, I'm not fond of that, but you can't blame me for that.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   The only thing is...
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   I was Twitter before they were Twitter.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Let's put it that way.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   It's basically people that are using the system the way it wasn't designed and it falls over
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   when you use it that way.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   And it's a violation of their terms of use and they put a cap now.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   You can only follow 2,000 people.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Oh, yeah, that's right.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   They changed that.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Kevin, I'll tell you the deal.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   I dropped you.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   I'm going to put you on.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   I'm going to follow you.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   But I did it because during that era when you and Leo were fighting it out, I felt obliged
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   to Leo to take one number away from you and to give Leo one more.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   It didn't do any good.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   I'm going to cry.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   I'm very touched.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   It didn't do any good, but that's what I did.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   It's kind of...
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   That's man-love.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   That's man-love.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Now that we're back together, I will play the game.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   You guys are having a life.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   You know, actually, we had a meeting on Friday called Bearhug Camp.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   The point of which was, it was kind of started by Dave Weiner and Steve Gilmore.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   The point of it was to bring all the players together.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   I actually wish we'd had you or Leo or somebody from my past.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Two bears.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   You're Leo, by the way.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Leo, who is the creator of Pounce, which Kevin is...
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   What is your title at Pounce?
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   You CEO, president.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   What are you?
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Well, we all kind of share the responsibilities.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   It was just a little project that the three of us got together.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Daniel Burke, Leo Culver, myself, and decided to create.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Yeah, it's very cool.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Love Pounce.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Love Jai-ku.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Love Twitter.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Love all of these things.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   But one of the problems is there are all these individual silos of information.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Just like in the early days of email, when you had a copy survey account, you couldn't
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   email somebody on MCI email.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   We want to make it so that everybody is federated and the data is kind of transferred from one
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   to the other.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   So we had a lot of the players came.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   It was really good because I'm running this Laconica instance at Twitter Army.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   But actually it was interesting because Alex Payne, Jack Dorsey, and Biz Stone came.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Awesome.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   From Twitter.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   They didn't stay.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   They came because I think because they felt like...
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   And this is the point of Bear Hug.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   They kind of felt like if we don't show up, then we're showing disdain for the community.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   So they felt like they had to come.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.500]   And the question that was asked of them several times in many different ways was when you're
[00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.000]   going to restore track, when you're going to restore IAM, when you're going to make the
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   data stream of Twitter available to others.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Twitter has fallen on this excuse that there's a technical reason they can't do it.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   It's bringing the CIR system down.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   But I think that that's kind of no longer credible.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   And I think they even are saying, "Well, we're trying to figure out a way to do it."
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   I think what's happening is they want to...
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   That's the real value of Twitter is this data stream created by all its users.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   You kind of have the same issue, Kevin, with Dig.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   And even...I think there's been some push and pull between Dig and its consumers, some
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   of whom feel like, "Well, we created the content on Dig.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   We feel like we should have some say in how it's used."
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Well, they have absolute say.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   Everything that is created on Dig falls under public domain creative comments.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   They can take...they can use our API, take all the data, and read a split in any way
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   they feel fit.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   So, yeah.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   I'm stealing it tomorrow.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Hey, can we get to the news?
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   This is news.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Okay.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   This is a big story.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   There's something...is there something I should be doing in the video world, by the way, just
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   as an aside?
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   No, because I can't do video on the threesome.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Excellent.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   You just have to stare at me, unfortunately.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Just check it.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   But I have to say, I saw you on Friday when we were at CNET.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Bear Hugcamp was a CNET very kindly.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Let us use a conference room.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   And you look fantastic, Molly.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   Oh, Leo, thank you.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Now that is news.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   It was Bear Hugcamp.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   That's what we're talking about.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Was Bear Hugcamp in San Francisco?
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Yeah, it was at CNET.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Okay, never mind.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Dan Farber, let us use a conference.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   We host all these hip things that I don't find out about until they're so happy over.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   It wasn't.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   Well, publicize.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.200]   I wish it had been better publicized, but I think the idea was to have the players in
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.200]   the room.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.000]   And I hope they invited you, Kevin and Leah and Daniel, but I don't know if they did.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Nobody invited me.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   You're not a player.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   Actually, people were saying, "Where's Devorak?"
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   And I said, "I don't know if Dork...this is the kind of thing Devorak would come to."
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   And he would cover the results thereof, but I don't think he's interested in process particularly.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Are you?
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   No.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   That's what I thought.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   So I let you off.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   But I like to get invited.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Yeah, I'm sorry.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   I should have invited you.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   I will invite you next time.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   But the good news is I think that, you know, Biz and Jack and Alex said pretty much committed,
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   "We're going to make these streams available."
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Just as you have, Kevin, we're going to make this content available for developers to use
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   in other ways.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   And that's really what we're asking.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   You know, you go to Twitter, it still says, "We're working to restore IM services.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Thanks for your patience."
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   It said, "That's it's May!"
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   They're not working on it.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   I think what happened is they said, "Hmm, we can make some money on this.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Let's hold on to it and figure out what's going on."
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   I don't know.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   I went and had lunch with Evan Williams the other day.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   He's one of the co-founders of Twitter.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   And we were talking about scaling the site.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   And he said that finally they have a really good team in place.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   You know, they acquired Samise, which was their search.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   If you go to search.towyer.com, and that actually works very well.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   And the people that they brought in from Samise, I think it was three or four engineers,
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   are now kind of like their lead architect and they're rewriting a lot of the code.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Well, see, this was the issue because Samise was the only company that was getting the...
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   We call it the Firehose, the full stream of information.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   And they folded Samise back into themselves.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   They spent 10% of their valuation on Samise, basically taking it back in.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   I think Gennip is getting the Firehose too.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   But Gennip says we can't let others see it.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   Twitter says they can.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   So there's just a question about what...
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   So anyway, as somebody puts data on Twitter, which all of us do, and add value to Twitter,
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   it seems not unreasonable for us to encourage Twitter to make that data available to others.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   Samise wouldn't exist if they hadn't done that, and Samise was an amazing innovation.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   And there should be more like that.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   That's the point. That's all it is.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   Good.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   Can we get to the news?
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   Yeah, what is the news, John?
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   Well, I don't know. You got it on the delicious site.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   I don't actually... I didn't really do much today.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   I didn't do much this week.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   Molly, you covered the news.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   What is the big story of...
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   What would you say is the big story of the week the Seinfeld Gates part duh?
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   I think so.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   As much as I was hoping that there would be other things to talk about,
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   that was kind of what we were left with at the end.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   Was Seinfeld Gates part duh?
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   Which I have said on Twitter and elsewhere, I thought was hilarious.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   It's funny.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   You were actually laughing out loud.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   Are you kidding me?
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   I chuckled.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   Chuckled.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   Audibly. I audibly chuckled.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Let's see what that would sound like.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   What is a Mollywood chuckle?
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   It's sort of like a...
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   [laughter]
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   Maybe more like a giggle, but I don't want to be all girly.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   That was like a chuckle.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   So I'm watching this.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   I'm watching one of these...
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   I think it was the IFC, the independent film channel.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   They were showing a movie and I was putting it on a DVD.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   Everyone says I love you.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   The Woody Allen musical.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   Oh, God.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Was that any good?
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   Actually, there's a lot of gags in there and they're the same gags that are in that crappy commercial.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   They couldn't even invent new gags?
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   They're telling you to say, if you go see that movie, everyone says I love you or just
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   kill all the songs and just listen to the gags.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   The person sitting at the table, the old lady.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   Get ready for this.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   It's not like any of that was groundbreaking comedy.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   The old lady is not groundbreaking comedy, but I thought that Gates and Seinfeld together had
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   funny energy and I think that into a very...
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   I thought they were just funny.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   They're funny too.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   They're just encouraging more of the same.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   I like it.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   It's absurdist and amusing.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   I think it's Microsoft's right to throw away $300 million in any way they see fit.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   I don't think these are good ads for anything, but they certainly...
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   Although there's an interesting interpretation.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   Remember last week, Ryan Block deconstructed episode one and came up with a lot of interesting
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   stuff like the shoe store was really a Mac store in a mall and it was discount shoes that didn't
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   quite fit, but you could make them stretch to fit.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   He came up with a lot of interesting kind of...
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   I don't know.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.800]   So I take it Leo that you didn't read in my PC magazine column where I interpreted the
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:49.000]   entire thing as an S&M pick-up scene.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   It's leather.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   Exactly.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   Exactly.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   Well, get this.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Here's the interpretation.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   That was vaguely hot.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   I'm not going to lie.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   So the little old lady wandering through is Steve Jobs.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   They say very explicitly that she's been with us for 12 years.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   Steve Jobs has been nappled 12 years.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   She runs everything secretly.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   She fixes the car.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   She does the laundry.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   Nothing happens without her.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   There's some interesting semiotics going on here.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   This is getting ridiculous.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   Now I admire the idea of doing a deep kind of a metaphorical, allegorical kind of interpretable
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   kind of commercial for the nerds out there that want to go through this, but does this sell any
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   product?
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   It's just totally ridiculous.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   And does anybody even get it?
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.920]   Well, how many utterly ridiculous seeming branding campaigns have we been subject to over
[00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:42.000]   the years where there was no ad in place?
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Point well taken.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   But somebody buys the rights to a stadium for crying out loud.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   Point well taken.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   The McAfee Coliseum has never made me buy any software.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.120]   It would have been ridiculous for Microsoft to come out with an ad that looked at anything
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.000]   like the Apple that I'm a Mac.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   That's true.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.280]   Or an ad that- I'm not arguing these points.
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.280]   Or even an ad that attempted to pimp Vista because it's the point that-
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:07.280]   How about something that tries to sell some damn thing?
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.280]   I think this was-
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:09.280]   Don't sell a thing except Microsoft.
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.280]   I think that's what you need.
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.280]   Sorry.
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.280]   It seems like this is the plan all along.
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:17.080]   I mean, we've got the tech guys talking about it.
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.280]   Tech guys and girls, sorry, Molly.
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.280]   That's all talking about it.
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.680]   And, you know, basically we're thinking about Vista again.
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:24.680]   It's in our minds.
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.280]   You know, we talk about whether it sucks or it doesn't suck.
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.280]   I don't know.
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:29.280]   But is that who they need to impress this with?
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:32.280]   They want the hardcore geeks to get back on board, right?
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:34.280]   They want that kind of like- I don't know.
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:37.880]   Maybe they're looking for that top-down approach where if the hardcore gee people adopt it
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.880]   or finally take a look at Vista again and say, "Oh, it's not so bad."
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.880]   And then that'll filter down into mom and dad and everyone else.
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.880]   So this is not aimed at general mainstream America.
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:46.880]   This is aimed at us.
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:47.880]   I'm not sure enough about that.
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:48.880]   I'm not sure enough about that.
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:52.480]   When you show Bill Gates his ID and it says photo of him being arrested, obviously the
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.480]   only people that know that are going to be the hardcore gee.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:55.480]   But we all did, didn't we?
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:56.480]   We all said-
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.480]   That is what I know.
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.480]   I know it's the workshop.
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:01.480]   There definitely are Easter eggs all over the place.
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:07.560]   But I can also see just for the non-deconstructing crowd for the kind of mainstream, the idea
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:12.640]   that they might- I can see it being just as aimed at people who just are out there thinking,
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:15.480]   "Ugh, everything I've heard about Vista is toilet."
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:17.800]   But Microsoft's not so bad.
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.760]   It makes you like Bill Gates.
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.280]   And I guess the question I have is, didn't Bill just leave?
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:23.280]   Well, he's gone.
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:24.280]   His history.
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:27.480]   So why is he the front man?
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.480]   Because the whole thing was a fake.
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.480]   He isn't.
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:31.480]   You always have said that.
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.760]   He's never meant to leave.
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:35.760]   But now they're adverts.
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.640]   Basically, these are ads for Bill Gates, if you ask me.
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.960]   And what a human funny guy Bill Gates is.
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:44.000]   He's a laugh riot.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.240]   And do you find it a little insulting that the whole point of the ad was Bill and Jerry
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:51.760]   are so rich and out of touch they have to move in with a regular family to understand
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.080]   what regular people are like?
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:55.080]   That's a little odd.
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.080]   Isn't that a little odd?
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.080]   Yeah.
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:59.600]   Do you want that to be the message?
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.640]   But again, I mean, it's sort of like if they tried to make a commercial that was probista.
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.600]   What else are they going to say?
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.600]   Right.
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:07.600]   You know?
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:11.320]   How about making it, you know, the advertising is not a new idea.
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:15.880]   And there are mechanisms that are out there for selling products and getting your reputation
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:18.160]   to where it should be.
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:24.960]   Going off the deep end with some crackpot crazy advertising campaign, thinking that,
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:29.120]   you know, a few people will interpret it or even worse that bloggers are going, I had
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.680]   to say I did this myself.
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:31.680]   I blog these.
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:35.960]   But the blogs are going to just run them, you know, and that's going to be free advertising
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:37.840]   because that Microsoft's a cheap company.
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:39.800]   They don't do a lot of advertising.
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:46.200]   The whole thing to me just seems to be so off base and so off the wall and ineffective.
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.280]   I don't think it's going to work.
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:52.320]   I think it's $300 million if that's what they're going to spend wasted eventually.
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:56.360]   Well, they keep saying, "Dope, just bear with us because it's going to start having
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:57.360]   content."
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.680]   They keep saying, "No, they've said that."
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.680]   They said, "This is just, we're setting up."
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:02.680]   They're getting longer each.
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:03.680]   It's just going to be hilarious.
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.160]   This last one was born in happiness.
[00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:06.160]   But they're not airing that.
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:09.880]   Now, first of all, I think you made the point actually, John, because how many people have
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:11.240]   -- I haven't seen it on TV.
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:12.880]   No, I never have.
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:16.000]   I mean, I know that it's been on drink shows I watched, but I must have fast forwarded through
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   it.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   I've only watched them online.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.400]   So really, maybe this is actually brilliant because --
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:21.440]   Maybe Kevin's right.
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:25.520]   Maybe it is totally -- Kevin, you might be right, that it is totally a love letter to
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:30.480]   the community who will then stop saying because really, who doesn't take a cheap shot at Microsoft
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:31.480]   or Vista at this point?
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.240]   Any time they can't.
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:34.240]   That's kind of intriguing.
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.240]   That's the case.
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:36.760]   That's very innovative marketing.
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:40.640]   It's getting too much negative publicity, Molly, for this to be the case.
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:43.240]   People are like, "Well, wait a minute.
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.240]   Wait a minute.
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.960]   Didn't you immediately go watch it as soon as you saw a link to it?"
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:47.960]   Yeah.
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:48.960]   I didn't -- And he flocked about it.
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:49.960]   And he flocked about it.
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:54.360]   And for every -- I watched the cat playing the piano too that doesn't mean I'm going
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:56.200]   to get a kitten tomorrow.
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.480]   But you liked it, right?
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:00.080]   You were like, "Oh, I like that cat.
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.080]   I'm pro cat."
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:04.960]   Kevin, was it the most dug -- one of the most dug links of the week?
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:05.960]   It was pretty high up there.
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:06.960]   I don't know.
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:07.960]   I'd have to go check.
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:11.120]   I would bet, you know, because everybody wants to see it.
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.680]   Oh, and the next one, it's going to be even hotter.
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:16.360]   I was just going to be waiting for the next -- yeah, I don't know.
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:17.760]   I think you might be right.
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:22.040]   I hadn't really considered the thought that it is -- because my complaint was if you're
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:25.960]   aiming at a mainstream audience, they don't know what the hell's going on.
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.080]   It's just weird.
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:32.880]   But if you're aiming at the inside or geek crowd, the influencers maybe, "Eh, it might
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:33.880]   not be a bad."
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:34.880]   That's an interesting strategy anyway.
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:38.160]   I'm telling you, Leo, I think it's going to get a lot of free publicity.
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:41.160]   They're going to get a lot of free bloggers that are going to put the thing up.
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.920]   But they're getting negative -- it's all in a negative sense.
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:47.240]   I don't think it's necessarily good even though, "Oh, all publicity is measured by the
[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.240]   pound."
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.800]   Yeah, I think that's true to a point.
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:54.840]   But the thing is that this is -- I'm not hearing anything positive except a few weirdos out
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.480]   there that think these ads are funny.
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.280]   I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:01.800]   I mean, of the few people with different tastes.
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:06.520]   It was in the top 10 technology digs, 3,128 digs.
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.120]   That's pretty good.
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:13.160]   Right under 30 beautiful Photoshop tutorials and 28 useful cheap cheats.
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.800]   Well, that tells you something.
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:17.800]   By the way --
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:20.120]   I've heard a lot of news week.
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:23.040]   You Kevin Rose hit the nail on the head.
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.600]   We're going to talk about the new NANOs.
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.600]   You couldn't have been more right in every respect, not just about the NANOs, but about
[00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:29.600]   iTunes, Kevin.
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.880]   But first, let's show you how a real ad is done.
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.480]   What do you say?
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:37.720]   Next time you go shopping, I want you to take along your Visa card, my friends.
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:38.720]   Visa makes it safe.
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:39.720]   It makes it secure.
[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:45.560]   Visa does so many things to make sure that they prevent, detect, and resolve online fraud
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:48.960]   so you don't have to feel bad when you go shopping.
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:53.800]   If it's online or off, you just whip out that Visa card and you know you're not liable
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:57.320]   for unauthorized purchases on your Visa card.
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:58.560]   That's what I'm telling you.
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:01.240]   Safe, secure, Visa.
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:02.560]   That's real peace of mind.
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:03.560]   Right, Jeff Smith?
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:04.560]   All right.
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.360]   Now I get it.
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:10.240]   I've got to give them some credit for being safe and secure.
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:14.560]   No problems, they assure it's Visa, Visa, Visa.
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:17.160]   That's commercial.
[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:21.120]   All right, Kevin Rose, you hit the nail on the head.
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:26.720]   I was very impressed that document you had obviously was the real deal.
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.560]   Apparently so.
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:32.240]   I mean, that was a picture of the actual NANO.
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.560]   I just got mine today, by the way.
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:34.560]   How do you like it?
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:35.560]   Good.
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:36.560]   It's super thin.
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:37.560]   It's tiny.
[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:40.320]   I got it because I wanted to start using that Nike fit.
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:41.320]   Right.
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:43.560]   Now you still have to buy the thing for the shoe though, right?
[00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:44.480]   Right, correct.
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.480]   This goes in your shoe.
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.320]   But you don't need a dongle for the iPod anymore.
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:48.680]   It automatically senses it.
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:49.680]   What does it sense?
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.160]   Have you used it yet?
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:54.360]   You still need a dongle for the NANO, but not for the touch.
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:55.360]   Oh.
[00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:56.520]   You're going to credit it to the touch.
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:57.520]   Okay.
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:58.520]   So you bought a NANO?
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:19:59.520]   Right.
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:00.520]   Got the NANO.
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:01.600]   And is it pretty?
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:02.600]   Is it glarey?
[00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:05.440]   Yeah, it's not too bad.
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:09.240]   There's a little bit of screen glare there that wouldn't be there if they went with a flat
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:10.240]   screen.
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:13.520]   But you know, it's pretty clear and the colors are amazing.
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:14.520]   They're very vibrant.
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:15.520]   Is it a NANO?
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:16.880]   Did you have the fat NANO?
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.720]   Because I'm told it's the same screen.
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.240]   I have the first gen NANO.
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.240]   Okay.
[00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.240]   I still have an upgrade.
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:24.840]   This is my first upgrade in my years and years and years.
[00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:28.160]   Well, we're glad you could afford to get a NANO, Kevin.
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:32.480]   I'm glad you said that too, because it answered my question, which was like, is this, is it
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:33.840]   enough to upgrade?
[00:20:33.840 --> 00:20:38.120]   Like, I mean, we have the fat NANO at the house and I can't see reason why I would
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:39.120]   have this one.
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.120]   It's the same screen.
[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:43.120]   Unless you want that shake thing, the shake to shuffle, which seems kind of dark.
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.120]   It's really.
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:45.120]   Yeah.
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:48.160]   I mean, it's neat, but you'd actually spend money just to get that if you had a perfectly
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.160]   good working NANO.
[00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:50.160]   You can't hear my theory.
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.160]   Come on.
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.600]   Apple has finally done the Detroit thing.
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:57.880]   When a product gets mature, you can't really add significant new features.
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:58.880]   So what do you do?
[00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.600]   You change the styling in order to encourage people to buy new ones.
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:01.600]   You have to change the styling.
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:02.600]   You add fins.
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:04.160]   So basically, that's what they're doing here.
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:06.000]   They're adding fins.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.400]   How long can you do that for, though?
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.240]   Well, the Detroit did it for years.
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:15.600]   No, I know the 50s and 60s, that's where that was the dominant kind of thinking.
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:20.360]   But before that, previous that in the 40s and 30s, and since then, and especially in
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:26.640]   the 70s and 80s, it turns out that there's not enough talent in the world that can make
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:27.640]   that work.
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:28.640]   I mean, we haven't seen that.
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:33.720]   I mean, if you look at that little oddy TT, I was looking at some of my old photos that
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:36.360]   was did hand over like 10, 12 years ago.
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:37.880]   And there's one of them there in Germany.
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:38.880]   Oh, interesting.
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:39.880]   It hasn't changed at all.
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:44.880]   Well, they've got the best, simply the best industrial designer in the world, Jonathan
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:46.400]   Ive.
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.440]   If anybody could do it, it'd be Johnny.
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:50.440]   But you got a point.
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:54.520]   There's a diminishing returns, especially because I don't think consumers, I think consumers
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.400]   know more than they ever did before.
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:00.280]   Also, the other thing is a car wears out, the Nano or the iPad.
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:01.840]   They're not really going to wear out.
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:07.960]   Yeah, but some people like to load them up so they do kind of wear out.
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:11.440]   You know, if you got the thing full, they didn't even have the batteries.
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:14.160]   But you need another one for the spillover?
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:15.160]   The batteries wear out.
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:20.720]   Yeah, no, no, I'm saying to them, to me, people, I know, you know, these, a lot of kids, they
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:23.640]   put their entire collection in there and then they keep throwing stuff on and they don't
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:24.640]   like to erase anything.
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:27.280]   Well, look at Kevin, he has his first generation Nano.
[00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.280]   How long is that?
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:29.280]   Four years?
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:30.280]   Yeah, something like that.
[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:31.280]   Yeah.
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:34.620]   I think the next wave though, the next, I see them adding more and more kind of technology
[00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:35.780]   bundles inside here.
[00:22:35.780 --> 00:22:40.040]   You know, GPS support, internet connectivity, you walk in your house, it automatically
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.040]   sinks wirelessly.
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.940]   There's going to be a bunch of new features that are sprinkled into these devices over
[00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:45.880]   the next few years to keep people buying them.
[00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:46.880]   What do you need?
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:48.120]   That's GPS and an Nano for.
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:51.880]   Detroit has learned all too painfully that at some point you do have to innovate.
[00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:52.880]   Yes.
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:55.600]   Because the Japanese came and stole their thunder.
[00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:56.600]   Exactly.
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:59.400]   And I've heard a lot of people trying to still tell me that Apple is the innovator, but when
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.120]   it comes to the iPods, there's not a lot going on there.
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:05.220]   Except, I mean, certainly the touch and the iPhone are taking it in a whole new direction
[00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:07.560]   and I think Kevin's right again.
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:11.800]   That that's going to have to be where they take the iPod line because really you can't
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:16.080]   keep putting out a Nano like 15 months after the last one that just looks a little different.
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:17.080]   I got it.
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:18.520]   Apple has figured this out.
[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.520]   I found this on dig.
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:26.320]   A US patent application, 20080218-310.
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:31.400]   The company details a way to stop us using unauthorized training shoes with the insole
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:33.360]   sensors.
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.460]   A patent that allows you to do.
[00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:39.260]   They're going to shoe DRM for your shoes.
[00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:41.540]   I feel me.
[00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:47.940]   Pairing a sensor with an authorized garment such as a running shoe shirt or slack.
[00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:50.300]   I want authorized.
[00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:53.820]   Is there really that much piracy going on in the running shoes?
[00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:56.900]   Yeah, like there's a big shoe prop like people really are.
[00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:58.620]   Well, I just can't.
[00:23:58.620 --> 00:23:59.860]   I'm not buying that Nike.
[00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:02.060]   I want my Adidas to work with my iPod.
[00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:05.840]   Hey, go to Amazon and look at the Amazon reviews for Spore.
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:10.240]   Spore has one and a half stars even though it's one of the best games in years.
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:17.520]   And the reason is a concerted effort by anti DRM forces to jam the reviews.
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:20.920]   If you look at the reviews, all those negative reviews are I'm not buying it because of DRM.
[00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:22.840]   I don't like DRM.
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:27.200]   There's a real attempt now out there to say if it's got DRM, we're going to slam it.
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:29.960]   And as a result, they're getting bad reviews on Amazon.
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:33.060]   They call me on the radio show said is Spore really bad because I've seen the reviews and
[00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:34.700]   it's terrible.
[00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:40.440]   You know what's interesting is that this kind of thing really was even in the 1980s.
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:45.200]   Every time people came up with these crazy schemes to protect software from people backing
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:51.500]   it up or copying it for their friends, there would be this huge public outcry.
[00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:57.520]   I mean, there was a scheme once on a floppy disk where the idea was that each individual
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:00.080]   disk that you buy had a whole bunch of holes.
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.080]   Yeah.
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:02.080]   Remember that one?
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:03.080]   Yeah.
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:06.320]   And it would be mapped when they when they wrote the disk and if the map didn't show the
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:09.920]   hole when you made a copy, you know, there wasn't a hole there.
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:10.920]   In other words, in the other disk.
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:14.720]   And of course, it was central point software out of Oregon that kind of found the brown
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:16.240]   about way of beating this.
[00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:17.240]   I remember that.
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:20.920]   But people would make a fuss like there was no tomorrow and this never ended.
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:22.160]   It actually partly sunk.
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:26.600]   Word start when they came up with the word start 2000, which was copy protected.
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:28.080]   This is not going away.
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:32.520]   Well, not to mention the fact that the DRM on sport was cracked before sport was released.
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:37.560]   Well, and the main thing I think about sport, the reason that I mean, you know, arguably
[00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:40.120]   things have been coming out with DRM that have.
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:42.760]   You're not going to see games about DRM forever.
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:46.280]   In the marketplace, you're not going to see it, but the sport DRM broke.
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:47.280]   Right.
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:49.600]   The thing is that DRM technology has not kept up.
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:51.000]   It breaks things for people.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.520]   It ruins the consumer experience.
[00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:58.240]   So it turns absolutely legitimate buyers into obviously suspected pirates, but then people
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.480]   who cannot use the product that they paid for.
[00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:03.480]   And that's where the outrage about sport came out is it wasn't just DRM.
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:04.480]   It was poorly DRM.
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.480]   Right.
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:08.320]   And everybody became aware of just how stupid DRM can be.
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:09.400]   So I have sport.
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:12.880]   I installed it on both my Mac and my PC.
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:14.520]   I have no problems.
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:15.520]   What's the deal with this DRM?
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.240]   Yeah, it's working for me too.
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:18.240]   It didn't break for.
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:22.040]   I mean, it broke for a vote for an angry minority, but before having a lot of problems
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:23.040]   registering.
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:26.680]   The point is, the point is these are honest users.
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:28.400]   And activating, but they were all on it.
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:32.680]   And if you were a dishonest guy, you just downloaded the cracked version from a torrent
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:35.480]   and had no problems at all.
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:37.720]   So the people were having problems with the honest users.
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:40.600]   This is exactly not what you want to do as a company.
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:43.200]   Well, and that's exactly what DRM does.
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.200]   Right.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.760]   I mean, that's almost point of DRM, right?
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:49.040]   Like the, not the point, but the people who end up getting bitten by it are the people
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:50.920]   who are attempting to use it legitimately.
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:52.960]   These casual parts are a big problem.
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:53.960]   Is that the real reason?
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:57.240]   Because, oh, my people are going to make copies for their friends.
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:58.240]   No, come on.
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.240]   I don't buy that.
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:03.680]   I mean, I would assume that they would say yes, but I can't believe that's really digging
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:08.160]   into their profits to the extent that like large scale, you know, Chinese counterfeiting
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.160]   is.
[00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:12.920]   Yeah, I think that's got to be the big problem.
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:15.560]   Kevin, you had the sport creature creator for a while.
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:17.320]   I remember you were in that charity.
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:18.320]   Yeah.
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:19.320]   Did you win that, by the way?
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:20.320]   No, I did not.
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:21.320]   Who won?
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:23.040]   I have no idea.
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.200]   Raising money for a charity was a very good promotion.
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:27.200]   Handsome brothers are something.
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.200]   I'm serious.
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:29.200]   It was something like that.
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:31.200]   I don't know about the Hanson brothers.
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.200]   It was some, some like.
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:33.680]   The Jonas brothers is what you think.
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:36.360]   Yeah, you sound like an old man now.
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:37.440]   It was Hanson.
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:38.600]   It was Manuto.
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:39.600]   Manuto won.
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.480]   That's who won.
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:43.280]   New kids on the block.
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:44.280]   Yeah.
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:45.280]   Right.
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:47.120]   But have you, so what do you, if you've installed it on a couple of me, I put it on
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.120]   four machines.
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:52.120]   I had to download copy and then I had the box copy and I'm loving it.
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:53.120]   How far are you?
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.600]   How many copies do you need?
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.760]   You only need one because you can, and this is the other thing.
[00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:59.120]   I mean, I have to say it's not the most onerous DRM.
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:00.720]   You can install it on several machines.
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.760]   Five, I think.
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:03.760]   Yeah.
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:07.040]   No, I am not very far because I have so many different characters.
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:09.480]   The farthest I've gotten is the tribal level.
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:10.640]   Have you gotten to the stars?
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:11.640]   Are you, are you?
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:12.640]   Not yet.
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:13.640]   I'm just one past the tribal now.
[00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:15.640]   I'm like where you're actually building cars and things.
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:16.640]   Yeah, it's fun.
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:17.640]   And it's different.
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:21.480]   It's different games because each level is really a very different game.
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:22.880]   I'm quite enjoying it.
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:23.880]   That's beautiful.
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.960]   I think we'll write as brilliant.
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:29.880]   So Kevin, you were also right about iTunes 8.
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:32.800]   You even read about the genius thing.
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:33.960]   You've got good sources.
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:37.760]   Yeah, you know, I think I'm not going to leak any stuff next time if I hear anything,
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:38.760]   though.
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:39.760]   Why not?
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:40.760]   Why?
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:42.840]   Just because all these people were replying to me on Twitter and they're like, oh, you
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:44.240]   kind of exploded for us.
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.240]   You know, we were excited.
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:49.000]   There was going to be something new and I, please.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.800]   You're a spoiler.
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:51.800]   Those are losers.
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:52.800]   That is ridiculous.
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:55.160]   I don't want to be the spoiler that sucks.
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:56.600]   I don't want to be the spoiler.
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:58.000]   I can't even laugh at it.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.360]   I kind of feel that way.
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:02.880]   I actually, I mean, it doesn't bother me, but I do.
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:03.880]   It does kind of take some of it.
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:06.440]   You are the, you and Kevin are built from the same.
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:07.680]   I feel the, no, no, no, no.
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:10.880]   I'm saying I feel like I kind of wish I hadn't known.
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:11.880]   I like the surprise.
[00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:12.880]   Oh, please.
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:15.040]   This is like people that have a baby.
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:16.280]   Hey, Molly, you should do this.
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:17.640]   We didn't want to know the sex either.
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:19.640]   We didn't want to know the sex.
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:25.120]   Meanwhile, the doctor knows the sex, the nurse knows the sex and anyone in between knows
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:29.480]   the sex, but I don't want to know the sex so I can be surprised.
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:30.960]   What kind of a surprise is this?
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:31.960]   It's not much of a surprise.
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:32.960]   Everybody else knows.
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:33.960]   Did you know?
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:34.960]   Did I know?
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.400]   If I can know, I want to know.
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:37.400]   Yeah.
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:40.760]   If the technology exists to let me know, I'm not going to sit there and lie in the dark.
[00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:42.840]   Jennifer and I did not want to know.
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:45.080]   And I don't know why.
[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:46.080]   We wanted the surprise.
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:48.040]   We thought it'd be fun to surprise us right there.
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:50.320]   There's the surprise that minute when they tell you.
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.760]   It's a better surprise.
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:54.960]   It's a better surprise when the baby comes out and you look and see if it has a peepee
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:55.960]   or a po-po.
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:56.960]   That's great.
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:58.960]   Why do you do this?
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:29:59.960]   What?
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:00.960]   I don't know.
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:04.000]   You can tell having a kid that's not a book.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.480]   I don't have to get be responsible to your friends.
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:09.240]   They want to know what to buy.
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:10.880]   They can give us yellow stuff.
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:14.320]   Do you paint the room blue or pink or whatever?
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:16.880]   Yellow makes people tense.
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:19.240]   People fight more in yellow rooms than any other.
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.240]   Yellow is the worst.
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.240]   Are you red with another wallpaper?
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:22.240]   And gift cards.
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:23.240]   You can buy whatever you want afterwards.
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:24.240]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:26.320]   Gift cards are the biggest scam in the world.
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:27.320]   Okay.
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:30.640]   Molly, did you register your child's domain name?
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:34.560]   No, but he is on Twitter.
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:37.440]   That's the new domain name.
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:38.440]   We don't need them.
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:43.160]   We registered it before we were going to name him.
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:45.960]   We just registered it as my husband.
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:47.960]   His name is Jumo Jr.
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:48.960]   Jumo?
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:51.920]   That's Justin Molly Jr.
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:52.920]   J-R-J-U-N-I-O-R.
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:53.920]   J-U-M-O-J-R.
[00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:55.920]   It's what's your perspective?
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:57.920]   I'm following him now.
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:30:58.920]   No, it's not password perspective.
[00:30:58.920 --> 00:30:59.920]   No, no, yeah.
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:00.920]   Sorry, the blog is.
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:01.920]   But you can follow him on Twitter.
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:02.920]   Daddy keeps yelling.
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:03.920]   Eli, stop grabbing knives.
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:08.120]   I have no idea what the big deal is, but he sounds serious.
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:10.200]   He's very literate for a one-year-old.
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.200]   He's good.
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:16.080]   Yeah, he's not a super fast typer, so each Twitter takes a while.
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:18.240]   He's a really good speller.
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:22.800]   Yeah, it was because of spell checkers.
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:25.560]   Let's get back to this point about surprising people.
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:31.000]   What you're saying is that you'd rather be pushed around by the marketing machines, which
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.200]   is basically what the surprise mechanism is all about.
[00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:38.080]   These large corporate marketing machines are going to push you in one direction or another
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:43.600]   and you'd prefer that to advance information based on people actually doing some research
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:46.320]   and trying to help the public make decisions.
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:47.720]   What decision is nothing to buy?
[00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:48.720]   There's nothing to decide.
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.200]   I'm just saying.
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:51.840]   Yeah, no, I like the story.
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:54.080]   I like to be told a story, John.
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:55.800]   I just think you don't have to...
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.000]   I mean, it is all optional.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.760]   It's all optional reading.
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:01.280]   You don't have to...
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:04.080]   You don't have to voraciously follow every rumor.
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:05.080]   And then therefore...
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:06.080]   I do.
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:07.080]   Unfortunately, I do.
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:11.360]   So you have to take responsibility for your own rumor of mongering and then that's how
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:12.360]   you get spoiled.
[00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:13.360]   Well, I'm saying...
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:14.360]   Somebody's mad at me.
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:15.360]   Kevin or somebody.
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:18.320]   I mean, I'm not saying it was a big deal that I knew.
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:20.240]   But there's something fun about...
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:23.720]   Remember, don't you remember the good old days when we sat in the audience and Steve
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:27.720]   Jobs is up on the stage and he says, "We've got three new devices we're going to announce
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:28.880]   today.
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:34.440]   An internet appliance, the best iPod we've ever made, oh yeah, and a phone.
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:36.320]   And these three things are all in one.
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:38.840]   It's the iPhone and it's the first you ever saw."
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:40.480]   And you're like, "Yeah!"
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:42.400]   Don't you remember those days?
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:43.400]   Those days?
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:45.480]   It was like a year and a half ago.
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:47.640]   I remember my first Apple keynote though.
[00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:53.400]   My first Macworld keynote was the one where they announced the original colored iMacs.
[00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:54.400]   And I remember being...
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.400]   I mean, the feel of the truth.
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:57.400]   Yeah.
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:58.400]   I was so dumbfounded.
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:32:59.400]   I love that.
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:00.400]   I think...
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.400]   I'm older and more cynical than that.
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:03.400]   No, I think...
[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:04.400]   I think...
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:05.400]   I think John...
[00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:07.280]   I mean, you don't have an appreciation.
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:09.200]   No, I'm not 12 anymore.
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:10.200]   That's the difference.
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:15.560]   For the mastery, the marketing mastery that Steve Jobs and the Apple team are showing an
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:16.560]   amazing...
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:20.640]   Now, I know I'm selling like just a cracked Apple fanboy here and I don't mean to sound
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:21.640]   that way.
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:24.400]   I wish I would love it if Bill Gates could do the same thing.
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:25.680]   Oh, he could though.
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:26.680]   That's the whole thing.
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:27.680]   I think Gates should do that.
[00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:33.280]   You know, throw a big event, dress in black, come out there and then it's like every year
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:36.800]   show off something really cool, like surface or whatever it is that he has cool for the
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:37.800]   year.
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:41.960]   And instead of saying like, "Oh," and one more thing he could say, "That's not all,
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:42.960]   folks!" or something.
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:43.960]   You have some like tagline.
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:44.960]   He needs some tagline.
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:45.960]   Yeah.
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:46.960]   You need some tagline.
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:47.960]   Yeah.
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:48.960]   You need some tagline.
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:49.960]   Yeah.
[00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:50.960]   You need some tagline.
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:51.960]   Yeah.
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:52.960]   You need some tagline.
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:53.960]   Yeah.
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:54.960]   You need some tagline.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:55.960]   Yeah.
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:56.960]   You need some tagline.
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:57.960]   You need some tagline.
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:58.960]   You need some tagline.
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:33:59.960]   Yeah.
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:00.960]   You need some tagline.
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:01.960]   Yeah.
[00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:02.960]   You need some tagline.
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:03.960]   Yeah.
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:04.960]   And I think that's good marketing.
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:09.080]   Now, what's interesting, why do you think it is, Kevin, that Apple, which had done a
[00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:14.680]   great job for years, last three years keeping this stuff quiet, has now completely unable
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:16.640]   to keep it quiet?
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:17.640]   It's turned around.
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:18.640]   Yeah.
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:19.640]   I have no idea.
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:21.760]   I think this is just a fluke this time.
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:23.840]   I don't know if I'm going to get solid for a next time.
[00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:27.840]   The fat nano they knew about that, we saw pictures.
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:29.280]   I'm thinking that Apple is just so important.
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:30.680]   People are involved though.
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:31.680]   Yeah.
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:35.040]   When you're talking consumer devices, it's easier with a computer, isn't it?
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:37.360]   A consumer device, you got a lot of it.
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:44.280]   I mean, what we saw was probably that document that you had didn't come from somebody at
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.080]   Apple probably came from a vendor.
[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:47.080]   Right.
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:48.080]   Right.
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:50.880]   You know, so you can't keep these guys quiet.
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:35:00.040]   He actually, in the game I play in the writing game, you'd always go to the hard disk guys
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:02.600]   they don't see everything.
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:05.680]   They know everything, they have to see everything, they know everything in advance because nothing
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:09.400]   can be built without them being somehow involved.
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:14.360]   And they didn't mind talking if you didn't use their name.
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:15.960]   And so you can kind of keep up with this stuff.
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:17.480]   You can't keep everything a secret.
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:23.360]   I mean, unless you're totally vertically and horizontally integrated to such an extent
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:28.000]   that you can lock everything down, like for lock, talking about lock, like lock heeds
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   skunk works.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.800]   I mean, they could be building a rocket ship for all we know.
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:34.840]   We would never find out about it because they do everything in the in-house.
[00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:35.840]   Internally, yeah.
[00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:36.840]   Yeah.
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:37.840]   You're, I remember that.
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:41.880]   I mean, I've seen that people troop in and out of your house talking to you or you take,
[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:45.440]   I mean, you, you are always very good at getting those sources.
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:46.440]   Right.
[00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:50.360]   As a result, mainly I'll tell you, I'll tell you the key to success is that you, for one
[00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:53.320]   thing you can't, you have a bad memory like I do.
[00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:56.080]   You write down the important stuff, but you don't remember anybody's name.
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:57.080]   Right.
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:59.960]   And then you don't keep a lot in your notes are like sketchy.
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:06.280]   And to be honest about it, I am not lying when I say, I can't remember who told me stuff
[00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:07.680]   after they tell me not to use their name.
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:10.520]   I, and seriously, I, and it's not, and you could put me on a lie detector and I can't
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:11.520]   remember their name.
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:13.960]   But the key is I don't remember names very well.
[00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:16.080]   Kevin Rose, listen and learn.
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:19.240]   I'm taking notes, but not writing got names.
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:20.240]   No names.
[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:23.320]   Because they could subpoena the notes, you know.
[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:26.240]   And then he wants to, well, by the way, the irony of that is about every, like every
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:30.160]   decade somebody comes up to me and they say, you know, I'm the guy who told you blah, blah,
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:31.160]   blah, blah.
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:34.840]   And I look at him, I go, I don't even know who the hell this guy is.
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:37.480]   And I'm dead serious because I don't remember him from Adam.
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:41.240]   You know, I think one thing that has changed maybe is because of the internet.
[00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:45.120]   And this is where you're benefiting Kevin is there are these now vast communities.
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:48.240]   I'm looking in our chat room and somebody's saying, Oh yeah, my dad's an engineer at the
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:49.240]   Yolankeet's Conquerks.
[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:51.920]   They're these vast communities now.
[00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:55.600]   And this stuff is a little bit more porous because, but look at dig.
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:37:00.120]   I mean, you have this vast community of users who are sharing this information and they
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:04.280]   get some, and they get some stock and trade from knowing something, right?
[00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:05.360]   Yeah, right.
[00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:06.920]   It's a value.
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:09.320]   No stock, but yeah, I'm sorry.
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:12.200]   Carefully use that phrase carefully.
[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:17.280]   We're going to come back actually some, some scary news for eBay could be big trouble on
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:18.280]   the horizon.
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:24.720]   But first I want to mention this episode brought to you by Gobi, not the desert, the global
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:27.200]   mobile internet, Gobi from Qualcomm.
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:28.200]   This is kind of cool.
[00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:29.680]   You're starting to see them in laptops now.
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:34.640]   It's a new Gobi device, a wireless network card that's built into the new notebooks from
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:36.600]   leading notebook manufacturers.
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:38.040]   HP is doing them.
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:40.920]   Dell has one or is going to have one Toshiba.
[00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:45.720]   They allow you this card allows you to access multiple wireless carriers networks.
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:49.240]   So you're so when you buy these laptops, your network hardware doesn't have to be carrier
[00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:50.400]   specific.
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:53.400]   It supports HSDPA and EVDO.
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:55.800]   You get that real fast 3G connectivity.
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:59.080]   It's built in so you won't lose it, won't break off.
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:01.400]   And it's really global connectivity.
[00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:02.400]   Really amazing.
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:06.480]   They call it the world is your hotspot multi mode support for corporate network managers,
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:12.480]   one device and multiple carrier support means one skew notebooks purchases for any geography
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:17.400]   and no more hassle carrying around those external EVDO cards or HSDPA cards, that's
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:20.240]   going to be productive more places around the world.
[00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:21.960]   With a new Gobi, the world is your hotspot.
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:26.160]   Learn more about the Gobi powered notebooks from Qualcomm available at leading notebook
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.240]   manufacturers.
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:34.360]   Go to gobeanywhere, gobianywhere.com/products for the Gobi notebook for you.
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:37.240]   Thanks to Qualcomm and Gobi for their support.
[00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:38.680]   Don't have a jingle for them.
[00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:40.880]   That would be a good one, an easy one.
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:44.000]   Gobi, gobi, gobi, gobi, gobi, gobi, gobi, gobi, gobi, gobi, gobi, gobi, gobi, gobi,
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.160]   we'll write a jingle for them.
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:53.440]   So according to Barons in a report published today, but signing a report published last
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:59.120]   week by Wedge Partners, eBay may have to cut 1,500 jobs.
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:02.000]   The Wedge report says eBay's business is deteriorating.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:08.160]   The company is writing layoffs of 10% of its employee as much as 1,500.
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:10.440]   No, no, I'm sorry.
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:13.760]   It has 15,000 employees could affect 10% of its 1,500.
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:16.080]   That's the 1,500.
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:17.080]   What do you think?
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:19.640]   eBay, could it be in trouble?
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:22.640]   It's had a lock for a long time on this auction market.
[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:24.120]   Is there more competition, Molly?
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:27.480]   What are there more auction sites out there now?
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:31.600]   Well, I think it's not so much that there are more auction sites out there.
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:33.880]   I think people are over the auction thing.
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:35.640]   So the whole big competition.
[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:36.640]   Yeah.
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:39.200]   And they are really restructuring their business.
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:44.160]   They're really moving toward more fixed price sales, more buy it now, more catering to big
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:45.160]   sellers.
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:50.320]   I actually think if anything, they're positioning themselves to take more of an Amazon model.
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:52.280]   Because I think that is where their competition is.
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:55.800]   Well, I think Amazon has been killing them.
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:40:02.320]   My stepson Eric, who does the Craigslist finder, open source thing and some other projects,
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:07.400]   he was made for a couple of years ago, him and his wife were doing a lot of business
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:10.160]   on eBay and more in they stopped.
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:14.640]   And when he gets ahold of me, all he does is hoorang me about how screwed up eBay is
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:15.920]   they charge too much.
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:19.120]   They don't have, you know, there's all kinds of issues with the payments.
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:21.240]   They don't support the vendors.
[00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:25.160]   The whole and the scam, the whole auction thing is kind of falling apart.
[00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:32.040]   It's been semi scammed by these automated systems that will bid at the last split second.
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:35.960]   And the whole thing is, I think the whole structure is falling apart.
[00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:38.160]   Now where's Meg Whitman, by the way?
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:40.480]   She's busy campaigning for the McCain.
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:41.760]   Painling too.
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:43.920]   Maybe she should be, you know, I mean, she's spoken.
[00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:46.600]   She spoke at the Republican convention.
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:48.520]   This is one of the issues that you have.
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:51.000]   You have these, this is typical of high tech companies.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   Hello, Kevin.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   Can you hear me?
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.200]   There's these guys, there's these guys who have the brains.
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:58.200]   They have the vision.
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:01.800]   They go and they start these ideas and they make them, they take them so far and they're
[00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:06.320]   part of the whole system in terms of, you know, they can make the, when it comes to
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:09.720]   like a little bitty decision at some point, they'll make the right one.
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:11.320]   Somebody else won't.
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:12.680]   They're out of the picture.
[00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:16.120]   The next thing, you know, the company is making bad decisions because they don't really know
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:17.640]   what they're doing.
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:20.760]   And the next thing, you know, they're in the toilet and this company is one of those
[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:22.480]   companies that's headed in that direction.
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:25.920]   I think, I think they're, they're toast to be honest about it.
[00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:26.920]   Wow.
[00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:27.920]   I think I go to this side.
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:29.800]   All I see is buying out, buying out, buying out.
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:34.360]   All I'm seeing is a bunch of little Chinese shops that are in mostly in Southern California
[00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:38.360]   that are bringing stuff in from China and they're selling it, you know, really fast.
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:41.480]   I'm not seeing the stuff that they used to have, the kinds of things.
[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:44.160]   And the scammers, they've done nothing about the scammers.
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:47.000]   They've pushed everybody toward PayPal, which doesn't help at all.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.960]   I mean, it's like, it seems to me that the whole thing is falling apart.
[00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:52.600]   And when they had, when they were to get, they had it together and they were, they bought
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:56.040]   like Butterfield and Butterfield, one of the auction sites, and they were going to get
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:59.360]   into the real business and maybe learn something they couldn't deal with.
[00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:01.560]   And they sold them back off to somebody else.
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:04.280]   And they just now they're drifting like a rudderless ship.
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:05.280]   It's ridiculous.
[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:08.360]   So Kevin, you're not going to do that.
[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:11.600]   Well, I mean, eBay is very large.
[00:42:11.600 --> 00:42:12.600]   We are still very small.
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:16.840]   You have a long way to go for it to worry about laying off 1,500 people.
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:17.840]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:22.480]   But when we see Kevin Rose speaking at the convention, then we'll know.
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:24.320]   Yeah.
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:29.560]   I know Kevin spends every day, and I'm sure very long hours at dig.
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:31.320]   I know you work really hard at dig.
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:34.600]   Yeah, we're focused on product for all the new features.
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:35.600]   Yeah.
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:38.120]   No, the point is Kevin is in the same boat as everybody else.
[00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:42.040]   I mean, Meg Whitman was working really hard just like Kevin when the thing was a two-bit
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:43.360]   operation.
[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:47.200]   But when the thing gets really big and you're going to bring in the professional managers,
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:50.880]   I mean, I've been watching this going on over and over for the last couple of decades.
[00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:52.840]   But isn't there a natural lifecycle?
[00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:56.200]   I mean, maybe just eBay's time has come.
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:57.200]   Was there anything?
[00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:58.200]   I don't think they would have done the same.
[00:42:58.200 --> 00:42:59.200]   I don't think they would have done the same.
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:00.200]   I don't think they would have done the same.
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:01.200]   What could they have done to save?
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:02.200]   I don't think they would have done the same.
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:03.200]   I don't think they would have done the same.
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:04.200]   I don't think they would have done the same.
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:05.200]   I don't think they would have done the same.
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:06.200]   I don't think they would have done the same.
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:10.000]   I mean, do you think the auction model is possible?
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.360]   I think people got tired of the auction model and I'm not sure that it's feasible large
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:18.000]   scale, especially online where everything can be gained to the extent that it can.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.720]   It's possible to stop the gaming.
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:22.400]   As you say, John, that's sniping.
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:26.800]   It chases away normal people who want to bid on it because you're bidding, you're doing
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:32.000]   everything and then some sniper comes in at the last minute and boom, it's over.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.080]   If you're going to be an auction site, I think it's possible that you have to stay really
[00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:37.080]   small and be really all about special.
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:38.080]   Like Etsy.
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:39.080]   Like Etsy.
[00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:40.080]   Yeah.
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:41.080]   Yeah.
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:42.080]   I love it.
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:43.080]   Great.
[00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:44.080]   I love it.
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:45.080]   What?
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:46.080]   What?
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:47.080]   ETSY.com.
[00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:49.080]   It's for crafts.
[00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:50.080]   Oh, okay.
[00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:53.080]   And it's big, but it's not eBay big.
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:56.080]   Well, it only does crafts.
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:58.080]   And it's focused exactly.
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:03.000]   Well, there's that element, but here's the question you have to ask yourself.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.040]   I mean, like the eBay early on did a lot of wine.
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:07.760]   A lot of people collect wine.
[00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:08.760]   They sell a wine.
[00:44:08.760 --> 00:44:11.360]   You can legally do that especially with a wine.
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:13.560]   Once it's 10 years old, you can sell it.
[00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:14.560]   Oh, really?
[00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:15.560]   That was it the deal?
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:16.560]   If it's old enough, you can sell it.
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:17.560]   Ten years was the key.
[00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:20.360]   But I mean, people were selling it all different.
[00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:24.080]   They weren't doing that, but that is the legal limit.
[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:27.480]   Last time I checked was if the wine's 10 years old, then you can sell it on the open
[00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:32.920]   market as a citizen and as opposed to being a liquor store.
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:33.920]   And they were doing that.
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:36.120]   Then the wine commune and two or three other sites came up.
[00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:38.360]   They sucked all that business away from them.
[00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:41.200]   And now you're talking about this being a crafting.
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:48.600]   But if eBay had its act together, they would have themselves created the secondary auction
[00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:51.080]   sites rather than being the one big giant thing.
[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:52.080]   There you go.
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:53.080]   You came up with something they could have done.
[00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:54.080]   That's a very good point.
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:57.000]   Amazon is the big gorilla in all of this.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:01.720]   They've just announced they're going to start selling wine in 36 states.
[00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:06.120]   So if I were a wine site, I'd worry.
[00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:10.240]   Amazon is really the Microsoft of online sales.
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:12.280]   They're dominant.
[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:13.440]   I wonder what everything there.
[00:45:13.440 --> 00:45:14.600]   I buy toilet paper there.
[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:18.040]   Do you think they're going to sell specialty wine or do you think they're going to kind
[00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:19.200]   of do what Costco does?
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:22.880]   Like buy a lot of become a big buyer, yes, but of not necessarily.
[00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:25.320]   Don't kid yourself about Costco.
[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:28.120]   Costco is the number one wine retailer in the United States.
[00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:29.120]   Really?
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:30.360]   Don't kid yourself about the stuff they got.
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:31.960]   They have Easter eggs.
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:34.640]   The thing about Costco, that guy who's a CEO is an Easter egg.
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:35.640]   That's not okay wine.
[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:36.640]   Come on.
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:43.440]   No, some of them have some tremendous deals and terrific wine that float in and out of
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:44.840]   that Costco operation.
[00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:45.840]   It's almost frightening.
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:46.840]   John is there.
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:49.400]   John, before he became a computer writer, was a wine writer.
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:50.760]   So he actually knows where he is.
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:53.440]   I still taste, but professionally.
[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:54.600]   Well, not recently.
[00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:56.120]   What does a professional taster do?
[00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:57.120]   You get paid.
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:58.120]   That's the point.
[00:45:58.120 --> 00:45:59.120]   You go to a competition.
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:01.120]   You get one of the judges and you get to mind.
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:02.120]   Oh, really?
[00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:03.120]   Oh, you do that?
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:04.120]   Oh, really?
[00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:05.120]   Yeah.
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:06.120]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:07.120]   Did you see bottle shock?
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:08.120]   Not yet.
[00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:11.120]   That's about the famous 1960s blind tasting they didn't frat.
[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:12.120]   Yeah, I know I heard that.
[00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:13.120]   That's about the French ones.
[00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:16.800]   The thing that the guy, the spariard, I guess, was, and they did it.
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:17.800]   I met him.
[00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:18.800]   Really?
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:25.040]   Yeah, he had a shop in the US, a plasti matalan in Paris and visited him and chatty went
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:26.040]   in for a while.
[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:28.400]   It was the most unbelievable deal.
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:31.560]   I mean, I just couldn't put enough stuff in my suitcases.
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:34.520]   So how do you know when there's a good wine at Costco?
[00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:36.120]   Because now I'm curious.
[00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:39.560]   Well, Costco has a thing about Easter eggs.
[00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:43.360]   If you realize that and you always look around, you'll find, and once you know about the Easter
[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:47.000]   eggs, then you get really clued into looking for them.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   And you'll find them.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.400]   And they're in the cheese section.
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:51.040]   They always did a lot of wine and food stuff.
[00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:52.280]   But there's a lot of product.
[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:53.280]   They're just all over the store.
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:54.680]   When you say Easter egg, what?
[00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:55.680]   It's just like an awesome.
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:58.760]   It's like something that's underpriced to an extreme.
[00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:00.040]   But here's an example.
[00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:04.360]   I'm up at the Costco in Squim, Washington.
[00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:05.360]   There you go.
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:10.320]   And I'm floating around and I go over to the wine section and they have a 2001 Mouton
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:17.360]   Rothchild for $99, which is not a cheap wine by any means.
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:21.600]   But the wine, generally speaking, goes for $2.50.
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:23.880]   So I grabbed a couple of bottles and showed them to my wife.
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:26.280]   I said, look, what about it?
[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:28.560]   I said, these wines are, you know, this is amazing.
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:30.200]   This is the Easter egg.
[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:31.200]   And she says, what is it cost?
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:32.200]   It says $99.
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:33.200]   What?
[00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:34.200]   $99 bucks.
[00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:35.200]   That's not an Easter egg.
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:36.200]   That's a rip off.
[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:38.040]   But meanwhile, I knew what the deal was.
[00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:41.720]   These things that you got tried to buy a bottle and now it's about $2, $300.
[00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:45.760]   So I bought them, you know, knowing it was an Easter egg, but Costco has these things
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:46.760]   all over the store.
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:49.960]   The cheese is though you have to be knowledgeable enough to know.
[00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:50.960]   Totally.
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:54.000]   Is it, are they actually ridiculous deals or are they like?
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.960]   No, I've got some of them.
[00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:59.480]   I'm telling you, some of them are like, it's jaw dropping ridiculous.
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:02.080]   Will you come with me to my Costco?
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:03.080]   Twitter out.
[00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:04.080]   Twitter.
[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:05.080]   That's it.
[00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:06.080]   That's what Twitter is good for.
[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:07.380]   You go on a Costco wine date.
[00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:08.920]   That's what Twitter is for.
[00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:14.040]   Right now, right now at Costco in San Francisco, I'm going to go back on Monday because I had
[00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:16.440]   to check the wine out before I was going to buy it.
[00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:20.880]   There is one of the top 100 wines from the wine specter, the spectator 2007.
[00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:22.040]   It's an Italian wine.
[00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:24.680]   Barbearers, matter of fact, from Peab mind.
[00:48:24.680 --> 00:48:29.720]   And they're buried in the back of the cheap wine section.
[00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:31.280]   They're not even where the main wine is.
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:35.600]   They're buried in the back in this wooden cases for $9 a bottle.
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:36.600]   I bought a bottle.
[00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:37.600]   This stuff's fantastic.
[00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:43.960]   I'm going to go get a case on Monday or Tuesday and it's just a typical Costco Easter
[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:44.960]   egg.
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:45.960]   Wow.
[00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:46.960]   What is a retail for?
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:47.960]   North America.
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:49.320]   You won't get this wine.
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:51.120]   It's been sold out for a long time.
[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:53.480]   It would probably be like a 15, 20 buck wine.
[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:55.600]   But it's beside the point is you can't get it.
[00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:57.640]   It's a one of the really great.
[00:48:57.640 --> 00:49:00.560]   You can't get a wine this good for nine, 10 bucks period.
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:05.000]   This is because the CEO of Costco gets off on this.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   That's my understanding.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.920]   They know and it's a little present to you.
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:12.320]   It's a present to people who know what they're doing.
[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:13.520]   But it's also great marketing.
[00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:15.960]   Again, I see I love that when I see this kind of stuff.
[00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:20.800]   That's subtle marketing because now you're going to go to Costco more often, aren't you?
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:22.520]   This happened to me at Costco with hot pockets.
[00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:23.920]   I found them like $5.
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:24.920]   It's a pepperoni.
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:27.920]   They've got some pop tarts there.
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:28.920]   They're on sale.
[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:30.920]   Hey, it's a good vegetable.
[00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:31.920]   It could be a barbera.
[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:34.000]   It could be a hot pocket.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   It's to each his own.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:38.960]   I'll give you one that for people who want to find one that probably most of the Costco's
[00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:39.960]   have.
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:44.280]   They have a master of wine guy who's been buying wine for them as a negotiating.
[00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:46.680]   He's been bottling it under the Kirkland label.
[00:49:46.680 --> 00:49:51.440]   Now, I've been following the Costco Kirkland crap since its inception.
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:53.120]   That's their house brand.
[00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:54.120]   That's their house.
[00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:55.120]   It's a house brand.
[00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:56.120]   It's really weird to have a Kirkland wine.
[00:49:56.120 --> 00:49:57.640]   You don't think it's going to be very good.
[00:49:57.640 --> 00:50:01.040]   They actually have, and this is also buried in the back, by the way.
[00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:07.800]   They have a meritage, I think it's from 2005 or 2006, with a really fancy label on it
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:14.360]   and a big heavy bottle for $10.95, which is actually mostly a Merlot, about 65% Merlot
[00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:15.360]   wine.
[00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:16.360]   It's really a high-end Merlot.
[00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:23.160]   It tastes like a number of florist springs, Merlot, high-end, the trilogies.
[00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:24.880]   There's a bunch of high-end Merlot's that tastes like.
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:27.400]   It's $10.95.
[00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:30.400]   It's ridiculous for the price.
[00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:32.640]   There's a crap load of it there.
[00:50:32.640 --> 00:50:37.960]   There's another one they have, which is also picked by the same guy, which is a, I think
[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:45.280]   it's a Passo Robliss or Santa Barbara Pinot Noir for $13, with a very expensive-looking
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:49.400]   label on it that's like, "Why are they spending this much money on the label?"
[00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:53.880]   That is a very credible Pinot that's for $13.
[00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:57.200]   It tastes pretty much like about a $35 wine.
[00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:59.000]   There you go.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:02.880]   You're going to rush out right now and get that wine, folks.
[00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:03.880]   It's good.
[00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:04.880]   Would you please Twitter that?
[00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:06.480]   Because that's what Twitter's made for.
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:07.480]   Yeah, that's awesome.
[00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:09.040]   That's the stuff Twitter's made for.
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:14.040]   Anyway, sorry I went off of the tangent, but when you say this about Costco wine, they're
[00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:15.680]   notorious for this kind of thing.
[00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:19.320]   I think Amazon, I wouldn't be surprised to see Amazon sell high-quality wine.
[00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:21.560]   I don't think it'll just be wine in a box.
[00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:22.800]   It's hard to do.
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:26.360]   To do mass marketing of high-quality wine on a big site like that, I don't think they're
[00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:27.360]   going to come up with much because-
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:29.360]   Because they can't get enough.
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:31.040]   No, you can't get enough.
[00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:36.920]   You can get a few- I mean, some of these wineries do 600 cases a year of their best
[00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:37.920]   wine.
[00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:42.840]   I mean, 600 cases is like- and a national site is gone in five seconds.
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:44.640]   Of course, they do that with wheeze.
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:48.320]   I have it set up so that they will text message me when wheezer in stock at Amazon and I can
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:50.320]   never get there in time.
[00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:51.320]   Yeah.
[00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:54.320]   They're used to selling small lots of things.
[00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:56.840]   So, I bought the Wii Fit and I still don't have a Wii.
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:57.840]   The Wii Fit's just sitting here.
[00:51:57.840 --> 00:51:58.840]   You bought the game?
[00:51:58.840 --> 00:51:59.840]   You didn't have the-
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:01.840]   Because they sell out of the Wii Fit.
[00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:03.640]   I saw it best buying everyone's grabbing one.
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:05.640]   I got caught up in the moment and I bought one.
[00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:06.640]   There's good marketing.
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:07.640]   Boy, there's-
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:08.640]   Kevin, if you need a Wii, let me know.
[00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:09.640]   I got the contact for you.
[00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:11.200]   I want a Wii.
[00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:13.680]   You really want a Wii, I can get you one.
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:14.680]   My wife-
[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:15.680]   I'll tell you how much-
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:16.680]   You really want a Wii.
[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:20.160]   My wife almost signed up for two years of Comcast Voice Internet.
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:21.160]   Oh, God.
[00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:22.160]   To get the free Wii.
[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:23.160]   To get the free Wii.
[00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:25.400]   It comes with a Wii Fit.
[00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:31.720]   I said, "Honey, you're committing us to two years of this for thousands of dollars for
[00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:33.480]   a $200 Wii wait a minute.
[00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:34.480]   Slow down.
[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:35.480]   Hold on.
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:36.480]   Hold on there.
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:37.480]   Hold on."
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:42.840]   Plus, I have to say my father-in-law has that Comcast Voice service and it is horrid.
[00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:44.320]   We cannot get through a phone call.
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:46.560]   No, I mean, it is unbelievably bad.
[00:52:46.560 --> 00:52:48.880]   Like, every call with him is just non-stop stutter.
[00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:51.360]   We can't even talk to him on his home phone.
[00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:52.360]   It's typical for me.
[00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:55.960]   Every time we call them, they try to upsell us to the voice thing and every time we go,
[00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:57.760]   "No, no, we've got a relative who has it.
[00:52:57.760 --> 00:52:58.760]   It's a bizmo.
[00:52:58.760 --> 00:52:59.760]   You should be ashamed of your-
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:00.760]   It's interesting, huh?
[00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:01.760]   Yeah.
[00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:05.760]   You know, and they have to put a UPS in your garage because if the power goes out, it stops
[00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:07.600]   working, if the internet goes out, it stops working.
[00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:09.640]   I mean, it's not exactly reliable phone service.
[00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:13.160]   I'm not too comfortable with that in an earthquake country.
[00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:20.880]   So, TechCrunch 50 and Demo, have you been watching this political battle between the two of them?
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:21.880]   TechCrunch is-
[00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:23.680]   Once next year, they're doing them the separate days.
[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:24.680]   They're good.
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:25.680]   Two weeks apart.
[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:26.680]   Next year.
[00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:30.400]   Mike Harrington and Jason Collichennis put together TechCrunch 50, basically same format
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:32.680]   as Demo.
[00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:38.520]   They select hot in whatever it is, 50 hot companies and let them demo in front of VCs
[00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:40.200]   and press.
[00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:46.000]   The big difference was TechCrunch 50 is free and Demo was, you know, I think it was $50,000.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:49.240]   Did you ever do a demo with dig or anything like that, Kevin?
[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:50.960]   No, I never did.
[00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:56.520]   I suppose if you're looking for that Tech
[00:53:56.520 --> 00:54:02.080]   for 50 this year, though, I think if you're looking for money, it's probably a good way
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:03.080]   to go.
[00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:04.080]   You know, I've boycotted these things for years because of the non-disclosures that they provide.
[00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:07.560]   They make these people sign off on, which was to me as a journalist.
[00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:08.560]   You can't do it.
[00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:09.960]   Well, no, it's not.
[00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:12.120]   The journalist has to sign the non-disclosures to companies.
[00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:14.960]   It's like, so I'll get calls from companies saying, "Well, you know, I wanted to talk
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:18.560]   you about something, but we can't tell you anything about till after demo."
[00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:20.920]   I'm saying, "Well, that sucks."
[00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:23.800]   And the thing that I've noticed, and I've told these people, I said, "Well, you know,
[00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:27.640]   once you do that, once you make that kind of a decision that you're going to screw me,
[00:54:27.640 --> 00:54:29.600]   I'm never going to write about your company."
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:32.720]   And I tell other people to do the same thing because what's the point?
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:36.880]   And the other thing that I've noticed, though, is that very few companies that are brand
[00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:42.520]   new going into any of these kinds of things demo being one example, I don't know that
[00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:44.080]   any of them have ever been successful.
[00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:47.120]   No, no, that's a good question.
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:48.120]   I can think of some demo.
[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:52.480]   I've been looking at the TechCrunch 50 winner, yammer.com, and wondering, "What do you think
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:53.480]   of that, Kevin?"
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:54.480]   That was the winner, right?
[00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:55.480]   That's the best one.
[00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:56.480]   Yeah, the winner was yammer.
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:57.480]   It's a Twitter clone.
[00:54:57.480 --> 00:55:00.200]   It's a Twitter clone, but for businesses, and you have to have an email address from
[00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:05.040]   your company to claim it and log in, and you can do different things around like organizing.
[00:55:05.040 --> 00:55:06.680]   I think they have dates and stuff like that.
[00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:07.680]   It's, I don't know.
[00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:08.680]   Go ahead.
[00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:09.680]   I was just playing the video.
[00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:11.480]   I don't want to play the video.
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:12.480]   Turn it on.
[00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:13.480]   Yeah, I was more impressed with Fitbit.
[00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:14.480]   That was my favorite.
[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:15.480]   Fitbit.
[00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:16.480]   What's that about?
[00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:19.200]   Go to FITBIT.com.
[00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:20.200]   It's really cool.
[00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:21.200]   Oh, yeah, that works out.
[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:22.200]   That's a hard work advice.
[00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:24.000]   We tried to fit in this and your sleep.
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   This is cool.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   This is cool.
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   So it clips on your belt.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:29.800]   It was started by two former CNET guys.
[00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:32.880]   Basically, it has a little accelerometer in there.
[00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:35.600]   The guy that demoed it off on stage, he took 14 steps.
[00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:37.000]   He went back.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:41.480]   He synchronized it with his computer and said, "You've just taken 14 steps.
[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:43.080]   You've got calories you've burned."
[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:45.680]   Oh, I like this.
[00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:47.440]   So it's a fancy pedometer.
[00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:48.920]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:50.160]   It shows you, get this.
[00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:51.160]   So as you're wearing it.
[00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:52.160]   Where does it stop?
[00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:53.160]   It's not Kevin.
[00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:54.160]   Stop.
[00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:57.320]   Just saying this to these few thousand people, it's like I can't get to the site now.
[00:55:57.320 --> 00:55:58.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:55:59.560]   We kill every site we imagine.
[00:55:59.560 --> 00:56:01.560]   We kill every site we mention.
[00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:02.560]   I'm sorry.
[00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:04.400]   No worries.
[00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:06.760]   So basically what you do is you wear this device throughout the day.
[00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:08.760]   And then when you look at the side of the device, it's really small.
[00:56:08.760 --> 00:56:12.240]   If you can't see it, I mean, it's like, I don't know, it's the side of one of those
[00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:13.240]   old shuffles.
[00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:16.840]   And it's a clip though, so it goes on your belt or your pants.
[00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:18.080]   It's on the belt.
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:21.840]   And then as you look down at the little device, it'll tell you how active you've been and
[00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:23.600]   it has like a little flower that grows.
[00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:27.120]   And so the more active you are, the healthier the flower is where you can have it.
[00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:28.120]   No, but what's the sleep deal?
[00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:29.840]   It's monitoring your sleep too?
[00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:31.160]   So it also monitors your sleep.
[00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:33.880]   So it tells you how much you toss and turn during the night.
[00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:38.280]   And the cool thing though is when it sinks back to the computer, it plots all this out
[00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:41.520]   and really fancy looking like cool charts and graphs.
[00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:46.120]   And shows you how many calories you've burned, how active you've been versus in the past.
[00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:49.400]   And it's a great way for people to kind of track like, you know, I need to get up more,
[00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:50.920]   I need to move around more.
[00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:54.760]   And actually people have lost weight with this.
[00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:58.240]   Because it inspired, well, it's also a great way to, I mean, the best way I think to work
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:01.080]   out is to have, you know, being friendly competition.
[00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:02.080]   Right.
[00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:03.080]   Oh, so does that too?
[00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:04.080]   That's really good for that.
[00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:05.080]   Well, because you can share this data.
[00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:06.080]   So if you are...
[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:07.080]   You can stick with your friends.
[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:08.080]   Yeah.
[00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:11.280]   So if you're matching up goals with someone or you have a workout partner or you're in
[00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:14.600]   friendly competition, you have some kind of bet, like it's a really great way to share.
[00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:15.880]   I thought this was really cool too.
[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:17.200]   This looks like a good company.
[00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:18.200]   So that should have won.
[00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:19.200]   That's a good...
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:20.520]   And there's no fee for it.
[00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:25.120]   It's a flat $99 for the device and then it's free from that point forward.
[00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:27.160]   So you don't pay any monthly fee or anything.
[00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:29.120]   I think this could do very well.
[00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:31.720]   Social networking meets physical fitness.
[00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:32.720]   It was inevitable.
[00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:33.720]   It had to happen.
[00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:37.440]   Well, and at least it's not, I mean, you know, to their credit, at least it's not a social
[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:40.640]   networking site for fitness buffs because kill me.
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:41.640]   Right, exactly.
[00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:42.640]   You know what?
[00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:47.240]   Although I have to admit, I was really excited about Classic.
[00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:48.720]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:49.720]   I'm sorry.
[00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:50.720]   I'm watching Kevin.
[00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:53.160]   I mean, Jason Calicanis to get drunk at the...
[00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:54.160]   So go ahead.
[00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:55.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:55.160 --> 00:57:56.160]   I heard that was all I did.
[00:57:56.160 --> 00:57:58.160]   We'll talk about that later.
[00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:00.360]   No, I like the idea of sharing.
[00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:06.160]   I mean, there are a lot of websites like Gimme 20 and a bunch of websites that'll keep
[00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:07.160]   track of your fitness and...
[00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:08.160]   Right.
[00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:09.760]   But the Hiltis website.
[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:10.760]   This is really annoying.
[00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:14.680]   I mean, what is the deal with these websites getting so easily killed by just a few doubts.
[00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:15.680]   No, it's not that easy.
[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:17.920]   There's 3,000 people watching.
[00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:20.760]   Nobody expects 3,000 hits at the same time.
[00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:23.640]   It's a hilt every time we mention a site.
[00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:25.560]   Kevin, why don't you do it?
[00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:29.160]   The one thing I will say about this device though, the reason why I think it really works
[00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:30.680]   is I've seen a few other...
[00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:31.680]   I was sitting...
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:35.520]   I was one of the judges here and I was watching some of the other like health websites that
[00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:38.960]   were being pitched and all of them require manual input where you're like, "Okay, I just
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:41.160]   ate a hamburger, so I'm going to plug that in."
[00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:44.520]   I wish they'd make something that would watch what I'm eating and do that.
[00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:45.520]   That would be...
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:47.560]   Well, this is nice because you don't have to do anything, right?
[00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:49.280]   It's all wireless and syncs back to the computer.
[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:50.440]   You just wear the device.
[00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:51.440]   That's good.
[00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:52.920]   No, that's a really good idea.
[00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:56.080]   Can they make one for my gullet that just watches stuff go by?
[00:58:56.080 --> 00:58:57.080]   Your gullet.
[00:58:57.080 --> 00:58:58.080]   That's why I have to...
[00:58:58.080 --> 00:58:59.080]   You had to swallow something.
[00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:01.080]   I just watches stuff go by.
[00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:02.080]   There's a cheeseburger.
[00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:04.120]   Yeah, it would have to have hooks in it.
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:05.120]   So when you...
[00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:07.480]   As you swallow it halfway down to the esophagus, it would have to hook into you.
[00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:13.160]   I predict in the next century, the next hundred years, we'll have nanobots in our throat that
[00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:14.160]   can do this.
[00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:16.160]   Oh, it'll be something like that.
[00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:17.160]   I'm like, "Eating less."
[00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:18.720]   No, no, eating less is still hard.
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:20.520]   No, we've tried that.
[00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:24.480]   Molly, did I tell you how good you looked when I saw you at this?
[00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:25.480]   You did.
[00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:26.480]   You're hitting on her?
[00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:27.480]   No, not hitting on her.
[00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:28.480]   She's a married woman.
[00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:31.640]   I know she has two tattoos in a tongue piercing, but I still...
[00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:37.000]   I'm still not hitting on her.
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:40.000]   It's a tongue piercing.
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:41.680]   It's a long story.
[00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:47.080]   Our friend Will Harris interviewed Molly and asked her, "What are some things no one
[00:59:47.080 --> 00:59:49.920]   knows about you?"
[00:59:49.920 --> 00:59:50.920]   And now everybody knows them.
[00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:55.720]   And now everybody knows I confess to him that I had my tongue pierced for nine years.
[00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:56.720]   Wow.
[00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:57.720]   It wasn't just a bad.
[00:59:57.720 --> 00:59:58.720]   Oh, no.
[00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:00.360]   You know, I was committed.
[01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:01.360]   You're a mommy now.
[01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:02.360]   You can't be doing those.
[01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:03.360]   It committed.
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:04.360]   Committed.
[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:05.360]   Committed.
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.360]   Committed.
[01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:07.360]   I got engaged.
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:08.360]   I said, "I'm a grown up now."
[01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:09.360]   Oh, really?
[01:00:09.360 --> 01:00:10.360]   So that recently?
[01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:11.360]   Stains are over.
[01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:12.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:13.360]   Okay.
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.360]   Just...
[01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:17.840]   Had I been doing CNET video when I first started working there, you might have been
[01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:18.840]   before...
[01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:19.840]   We would have seen it.
[01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:24.840]   I thought you had an odd list, Burleigh on a Buzz outline.
[01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:27.640]   So were you there for...
[01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:29.920]   Kevin, were you there for the party?
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:35.040]   Apparently Jason got pretty sauced and started posting on Twitter stuff that...
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:36.440]   I missed the parties.
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:37.840]   I decided to stay home.
[01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:39.720]   You were a wise man.
[01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:44.600]   According to ValleyWag, not that they're the bastion of truth in the wilderness, but they
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:45.600]   say...
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:50.960]   Mike Arrington made CaliCance delete his drunken Twitter postings.
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:53.600]   This is where Twitter can really get you in trouble.
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:55.280]   How do you delete your Twitter postings?
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:56.280]   Oh, you can.
[01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:57.280]   There's a little trash can next to each posting.
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:00:58.520]   It doesn't work very well.
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:00:59.520]   Yeah.
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:00.520]   You better.
[01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:01.520]   You got to get to it right away.
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:02.520]   Yeah.
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:03.520]   I believe me.
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:05.520]   I don't see any of this on the index.
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:06.520]   Yeah.
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:07.520]   So what was he posting that was so embarrassing?
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:10.480]   Plus it lives on forever, you know, on friend feed and all these other places.
[01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:11.480]   You can't.
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:12.480]   Once you post it, you can't.
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:13.480]   In fact, I should search.
[01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:14.480]   Let's go to friend feed and see what he says.
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:17.680]   I'm more concerned about the misspellings than, you know, the embarrassing.
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:18.680]   Oh yeah.
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:20.640]   And that's the only way you can edit on Twitter.
[01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:22.400]   So, come on, guys.
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:23.840]   It isn't very good, is it?
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:24.840]   No.
[01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:25.840]   So what's the...
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:26.840]   Why do you say there was embarrassing?
[01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:27.840]   I never heard this story.
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:28.840]   Well, let me see if I can...
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:31.080]   Because it won't be on Twitter anymore, but maybe...
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:32.080]   I don't know.
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:33.240]   Did anybody read him?
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:34.240]   What he said?
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:35.240]   Apparently not.
[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:37.160]   I can't believe ValleyWig didn't have...
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:38.160]   Yeah.
[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:39.160]   No pictures.
[01:01:39.160 --> 01:01:40.160]   No pictures.
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:41.160]   It didn't happen.
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:42.160]   Yeah.
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:43.160]   Let's see.
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:44.160]   I'm going to search.
[01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:45.680]   The thing is, once you post on Twitter, it goes out to friend feed and all these other
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:47.160]   places.
[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:50.320]   So, you know, it's kind of...
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:52.120]   You can't just delete it.
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:53.120]   Twitter.
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:54.520]   I'm going back through time.
[01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:55.520]   All right.
[01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:58.960]   I am paying attention to Twitter today, and this is a great discussion, but I want you
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:02.640]   guys to know that it's like the two minute warning and the 49ers and Seahawks are tied
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:03.640]   at 30.
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:04.640]   Uh oh.
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:05.640]   How can that happen?
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:06.640]   It is a huge game.
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:07.640]   The 49ers stink.
[01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:08.640]   Oh.
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:09.640]   I know.
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:10.640]   And Seattle has lost a game at home in like...
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:12.640]   And the Raiders won today too, and they suck.
[01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:13.640]   And the Raiders won today.
[01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:15.640]   How could that even happen?
[01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:16.640]   The Raiders...
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:18.240]   I would thought they were going to go winless.
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:19.240]   I know.
[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:20.240]   And they beat Kansas City, which is not...
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:21.240]   But I have...
[01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:24.640]   Well, Kansas City, you know, that new guy is that coach there stinks.
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:26.640]   How are the Jets doing?
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:30.360]   The Jets are tied or just behind...
[01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:31.360]   No idea.
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:33.520]   You've really made a sacrifice to be with us this afternoon.
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:34.520]   I apologize.
[01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:35.520]   I had no idea.
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:36.520]   Well, I...
[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:39.000]   But no, there's no sacrifice not watching the 49ers.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000]   Yeah, no.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.880]   I only switched over because I thought that it was tied, but I have the...
[01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:46.360]   I might have the TV on mute.
[01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:53.000]   According to our very intelligent chatroom, one of the things that Jason Twittered is,
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:54.160]   "I am so drunk.
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:55.360]   I don't know where I am."
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:57.360]   Hey, I've been there.
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:59.440]   If you're so drunk, you don't know where you are.
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:01.080]   You wouldn't be able to find the Twitter...
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:02.080]   How could you do Twitter?
[01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:04.280]   That's like every third Twitter.
[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:05.280]   That's normal.
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:07.280]   That's a normal.
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:08.280]   I am so drunk.
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:09.840]   This is a lot of Twitter's like that.
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:10.840]   Yeah.
[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:12.960]   I'm sure you watch the Twitter homepage.
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:14.560]   Like, it's going to be wasted.
[01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:15.560]   Wasted.
[01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:16.560]   I'm wasted.
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:17.560]   I'm wasted.
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:18.560]   I should...
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:19.560]   Just woke up in a cab.
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:23.840]   I just woke up in my own puke.
[01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:25.720]   That's getting back to the conversation that started us off.
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:28.320]   That's exactly why it's so interesting to follow the Twitter stream.
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:32.600]   If you can parse it, you could write a little track that would say anybody says, "Puke,
[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:34.000]   I want to hear about it."
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.800]   You never miss another...
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:37.800]   Never mind.
[01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:38.800]   Another puke Twitter.
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:39.800]   Another puke.
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:40.800]   A puke.
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:41.800]   Sweet.
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:42.800]   Don't call them tweets.
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:43.800]   They're tweets.
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:44.800]   Sorry.
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:45.800]   Puke.
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:49.600]   In fact, when I was at this bear hug conference about eight people, when I said I'm with Twitter,
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:51.240]   they said, "Are you mean Twitter?"
[01:03:51.240 --> 01:03:54.280]   I was like, "No, that must have got you."
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:55.280]   Kills me.
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:57.320]   Oh, it's over.
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:58.920]   I've lost that trademark.
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:00.200]   I don't think that you should...
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:05.600]   I understand your pain, but at the same time, it's not like you're starving to death.
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:06.600]   No.
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:08.920]   In fact, now, and this is the thing, Evan and I talked about it.
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:12.680]   He said, "Well, as long as I don't do a podcast and you never do a microblog, I think
[01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:14.720]   we're okay because we have trademarks in different areas.
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:19.160]   Of course, if you go to army.twit.tv, you'll see I am in fact doing a microblog."
[01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:21.800]   So I'm just waiting for him to do a podcast, then we'll see what he's...
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:22.800]   He's not going to do one.
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:24.080]   He probably feels bad.
[01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:25.640]   I mean, he's a pretty nice guy.
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:26.640]   No, he's a great guy.
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:29.720]   In fact, we talked to him about it and he said, "Yeah, we knew about Twit when we came up
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:31.440]   with a name, but we just really like Twitter so much.
[01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:33.160]   We figured, "Ah, it's not going to be a problem."
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:36.000]   I have him on tape saying that somewhere.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.440]   Most people know the difference.
[01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:43.800]   If they don't know the Twit broadcast, yeah, they don't know the difference and it's
[01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:44.800]   not a big deal.
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:45.800]   It's not a big deal.
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:46.800]   It's not a big deal.
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:47.800]   It's not a big deal.
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:48.800]   It's not a big deal.
[01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:49.800]   I don't care.
[01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:52.640]   I think you can make out on the deal.
[01:04:52.640 --> 01:04:53.640]   It's fine.
[01:04:53.640 --> 01:05:00.040]   Let me take a break and mention that the folks at audible.com, the Audible, of course, is a
[01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:05.880]   great site that gives us our audio books of all different kinds, 50,000 titles.
[01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:09.840]   We want to mention a special Audible deal, the Platinum deal we mentioned last week.
[01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:10.840]   It's back.
[01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:16.360]   You can go to audible.com/twit2, audible.com/twit2.
[01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:22.320]   That's a special URL and you're going to get a special deal from audible.com.
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:26.760]   Turn up for a Platinum deal right now and you will get two books.
[01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:30.320]   Yes, two books for free.
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:31.320]   Just give them a try.
[01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:32.320]   We have lots of recommendations.
[01:05:32.320 --> 01:05:36.480]   In fact, if you go to the website, willhallmusic.com, you can see every recommendation we've made
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:42.760]   hundreds of them over the past two years on Twit and the various shows.
[01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:44.280]   I mean, there's a lot of them.
[01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:49.200]   Audible.com/twit2 will get you started and then sign up for two books.
[01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:50.200]   We love Audible.
[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:52.400]   My book is up there, by the way, John.
[01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:54.120]   Did I tell you that?
[01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:55.720]   I recorded a book there.
[01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:57.640]   Oh, he went off to get something to eat.
[01:05:57.640 --> 01:05:59.960]   I'm not supposed to talk to him during the commercials.
[01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:00.960]   I forgot.
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:01.960]   I forgot.
[01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:06.400]   I'm not supposed to mention anything.
[01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:10.720]   I read a book at audible when I was there last and let me see if I can find it.
[01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:13.360]   It's called Little Golden Riding Hood.
[01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:16.120]   Is it a kids book?
[01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:17.120]   Yeah.
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:20.160]   You should get it for Eli or something.
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:21.160]   Eli.
[01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:22.920]   Yeah, I love that name.
[01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:23.920]   Thank you.
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:24.920]   Me too.
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:25.920]   Little Golden Riding Hood.
[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:26.920]   Let me see.
[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:30.480]   There's little red riding hood, but don't be fooled by you want the true history of little
[01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:31.480]   golden hood.
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:34.240]   Don't be fooled by these little red riding hood stuff.
[01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:35.520]   You want to hear a little bit of it?
[01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:36.520]   Just see.
[01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:37.520]   C.V.
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:38.520]   Eli likes this.
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:39.520]   Absolutely.
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:40.520]   It is absolutely free.
[01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:41.520]   You can get it for free.
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:42.520]   Oh, really?
[01:06:42.520 --> 01:06:43.520]   Oh, yeah.
[01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:44.520]   Audible.com.
[01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:47.400]   There was once a little peasant girl, pretty and nice as a star in its season.
[01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:52.760]   Her real name was Blanchett, but she was more often called Little Golden Hood on account.
[01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:55.640]   See, we couldn't get the rights to red riding of a witch.
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:57.800]   Everyone thought the little hood sounds.
[01:06:57.800 --> 01:07:01.720]   Piece of cake to your grandmother for a Sunday treat tomorrow.
[01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:06.840]   You will ask her how she is and come back at once without stopping to chatter on the
[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:07.840]   way with people you don't know.
[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:08.840]   It was really fun to do.
[01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:09.840]   It's kind of...
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:12.400]   I do always tell people that you do an excellent Russian accent.
[01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:13.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:14.400]   Is that really you?
[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:15.400]   Yeah.
[01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:16.400]   Wow.
[01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:17.400]   Really?
[01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:18.400]   Good.
[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:19.400]   He's great, this guy.
[01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:20.400]   I'll tell you something.
[01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:24.000]   I'd like to see you do more of this kind of work, even though it's painful.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:25.480]   They actually asked me...
[01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:26.480]   They're going to do...
[01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:28.560]   I can't say exactly what it is, but they have a...
[01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:31.200]   I don't have time to do a whole book, but I'm going to do a chapter.
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:32.200]   Come on.
[01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:33.200]   If I write a book, would you do it?
[01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:34.200]   I would do your book.
[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:36.160]   Yeah, well, it is never going to happen.
[01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:38.560]   John, you've been writing a book as long as I've known you.
[01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:41.240]   First, you're doing a history of the Civil War, whatever happened to that?
[01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:42.400]   I'm still working.
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:44.040]   These books are all going to come out at once.
[01:07:44.040 --> 01:07:46.360]   Yeah, when you're dead, Eric's going to have to go through the...
[01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:47.360]   This is not...
[01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:48.360]   This is not...
