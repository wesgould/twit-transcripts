[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.800]   If you're collecting all the fill-in hosts, I'm two of three.
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.800]   Sarah Lane last week, I think it's Father Robert, right?
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.800]   Next week?
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.800]   Correct.
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.800]   So it's a fun time and we have an amazing panel.
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.800]   Starting with Ms. Natalie Morris, Tech reporter and host of Crash Test Mom,
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.800]   former Buzz Out Loud co-host of mine.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.800]   How's it going Natalie?
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.800]   That's true.
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.800]   It's going.
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.800]   Thanks for inviting me.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.800]   Thanks for joining us.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.800]   I know I got a heart out.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.800]   Okay.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.800]   I'm going to get out.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.800]   I'm worried that we would go long, but then I was like, oh, it's not Leo.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.800]   Oh, it's not Leo.
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.800]   Oh, I'm so many thinking.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.800]   We're getting it out of the way early.
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.800]   We will take half measures to make sure that we get out on time.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:15.800]   I'd be clear that I had the exact same thought and that's the only reason I drove up here.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.800]   So just don't let me down.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.800]   No, absolutely not.
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.800]   It's literally along with the introduction Molly Wood,
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.800]   executive producer and host of Always On at CNET, Blogger, and former co-host of Buzz Out Loud.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.800]   That's right.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.800]   How weird.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.800]   Yeah, thanks for joining us.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.800]   Thanks for coming all the way up to Stu.
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:29.800]   Oh, please.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.800]   It was a lovely drive.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.800]   Excellent.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.800]   We also have Jason Howl with us.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.800]   Came all the way to the studio, you know, four blocks away.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.800]   Thank you so much.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.800]   No problem.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.800]   You didn't drive, right?
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.800]   No, actually, today was one of the only days that I didn't drive.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.800]   Strangely, I live four blocks away, but I drive almost every day because of daycare.
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.800]   Producer, tech user, Dave.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:49.800]   And you hate to hear.
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.800]   Yeah.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.800]   Host of all about Android.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.800]   That's right.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.800]   Yeah, it's strange.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.800]   There's this weird thread.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.800]   And I think it goes even deeper, right?
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.800]   It goes, well, yeah, it's all the way throughout.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.800]   Well, Justin Robert Young of course.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.800]   Hey!
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.800]   Right here, podcaster, Blogger, writer, co-host of FSL tonight.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.800]   And former co-host of Buzz Out Loud.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.800]   Oh, totally.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.800]   Of course.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.800]   Yeah.
[00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.800]   It's not really remembered as much.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.800]   Well, yeah.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.800]   It was deleted from the archive.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.800]   Due to contractual issues.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.800]   Sort of a Pete Best situation.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.800]   You know, I just feel like you never really get your due.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.800]   I'm out of New York.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.800]   For the record, David, who I?
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.800]   For those of you who don't know what Buzz Out Loud is.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.800]   He's like the missing beetle.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.800]   Well, probably.
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.800]   Exactly.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.800]   He's part talking about tech.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.800]   You're the obscure character at DragonCon.
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.800]   Sure, exactly.
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.800]   I know, yeah.
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:36.800]   Buzz Out Loud cast.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.800]   He is because he just looks like that.
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.800]   You're laughing, but right now somebody is Googling furiously.
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.800]   To try to find Justin Robert Young.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.800]   I don't think that's true.
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.800]   I think they're wrong about that.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.800]   I'm going to post it on Google Play.
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:50.800]   I watched every episode twice.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:57.240]   It's going to be like the loose change video of like proving how I was deleted from the
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.240]   Buzz Out Loud.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.240]   I'm just stalling this.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.800]   You can play them all backwards.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.800]   Yeah.
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.800]   But then why is there dead mic time in episode 463?
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:12.800]   It's ironic because Shadow goes here and it shouldn't be another person next to her.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.800]   There really is techniques to talk about this week.
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.000]   Let's start with, I want to start with Amazon because the Kindle announcements weren't all
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   that.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   It was a nicer screen, they're a little thinner, whatever.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.560]   I thought what Bezos did was really interesting though because he brought people to him.
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.520]   He didn't have a big on stage announcement.
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.320]   And then he said, "Oh, and by the way, we've got this little button now where you press
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.920]   called the Mayday button that within 15 seconds, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, including
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.640]   right after Christmas when everybody gets new kindles, someone, a real person will show
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.040]   up on the screen and talk to you and help you with whatever problem you want."
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.240]   Unless your problem is your internet connectivity.
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.240]   Yeah.
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.240]   One assumes.
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.560]   I would like to point out, and I'm not trying to be a big buzzkill here, so to speak, that
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.880]   is probably the number one problem that new Kindle owners have getting online.
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:56.880]   Yeah.
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:57.880]   Yeah.
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.280]   Other than that though, good idea.
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.760]   I mean, is it helpful for people?
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:03.760]   I don't know.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:10.080]   Like, I don't know if somebody is going to be able to let, I mean, if you are, and tablets
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:17.000]   are not exactly trying to crack the final code here, you know, they're designed to be user-friendly
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   devices.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.280]   If somebody can't figure out how to use a Kindle on something, hitting the Mayday button,
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.600]   how much is A, that person on the other end with, I mean, who, we have no guarantee exactly
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.480]   how helpful these people are going to be.
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.120]   If tech support is any...
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.280]   Well, you have a promise, Amazon has said they'll be trained and they'll be able to
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.000]   take over your tablet with your permission.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.360]   Is there anybody that is that like, do we ever get word that like, oh, call this 800
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.360]   number?
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.360]   They're not trained at all.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.920]   They have no idea what the hell they're talking about.
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.920]   They're going to be on the same tree as the people that would be on the phone.
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.640]   It's an interesting idea to, you know, say, oh, well, if you look at them, it's going
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:53.920]   to be a different experience.
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:59.000]   But beyond what I think Amazon is smart to do, which is to be kind of the anti-Google,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.640]   where Google is almost famously anti-customer support.
[00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.480]   They're a thing that's a pro-customer support.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:09.240]   I think that's an interesting idea to establish that they are making strides in that direction.
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.720]   But in terms of how helpful it's going to be, it won't be that...
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:17.000]   Does anyone here use Amazon Remembers or Amazon Finds?
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.200]   Amazon Remembers where you take a picture of something and you say, I want this, find
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.200]   it on Amazon.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.240]   So they already staff people like this around the clock because they can usually get back
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.440]   to you within like 20 minutes or less.
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.440]   That's right, that was...
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.900]   Here, just out of the store and you take a picture of something, they'll email you right
[00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.000]   away and say, here it is on the site.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.520]   So they already do this kind of staffing.
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:39.080]   I don't think people know about it all that much, but I use it a lot and I think they're
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.080]   pretty successful.
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.320]   I think these guys are already figured out the model of how to staff that.
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.600]   I actually do think that they are going to provide good customer service.
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.600]   And I think though, the more important point is that they are attempting to show that they're
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.440]   going to provide good customer service and that that is really valuable to people.
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.440]   People love that.
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.040]   That was one of the weird things that...
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:01.440]   Weirdly rather, that was one of the things that people loved about the Nook.
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.160]   And one of the ways that the Nook built such a sort of cultish fan base was on the promise
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.920]   that you could take your Nook into a Barnes and Noble store anywhere and get help.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:16.160]   And the Kindle is a slightly different user interface from Android from iOS.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.640]   I could actually see if your problem again was not getting online, which I bet you that
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.200]   80% of the problems are.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.440]   I'm not just saying that.
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.440]   I really...
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.280]   No, I think there's going to be a lot of people like, I'm hitting the Mayday button.
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.280]   Why does that work?
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.280]   Why does that work?
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.280]   I'm pressing the Nook.
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:30.280]   That's the only thing.
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.280]   I already thought of that.
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:37.720]   And so probably if you press the Mayday button, it says you're not online, go to www.kindle.slashmayday.
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.720]   They probably will have to cut that through.
[00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.720]   And if they haven't, that's a good idea, guys.
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.720]   They won't have a different machine.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:43.720]   If they haven't, then good.
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:46.560]   Well, but they are trying to sell this to people who are using it as their only machine,
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.560]   right?
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.240]   And so they need to provide some phone support.
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:54.040]   I mean, Amazon definitely is saying this is the Mayday button is meant not for us,
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.320]   but for the person like my mom.
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:56.320]   Mom has an iPhone.
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.320]   That's it.
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.320]   She doesn't have a computer.
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.320]   So she doesn't have another machine.
[00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.320]   Yeah.
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.640]   And I think that's what they're hoping with the Mayday button is for those people, this
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:07.840]   is going to be their only computer because tablets are becoming that for some people.
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:09.520]   How does that work?
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:13.600]   If the Mayday button is what they're hinging their holiday sales on, and this is what
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:18.040]   I thought at the time, then the Amazon Kindle line may be in more trouble than we thought.
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:23.280]   The Kindle tablet line, because it didn't seem to me to be or maybe it doesn't matter,
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.280]   right?
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.280]   Maybe they're like, look, these are great.
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.280]   They're selling great.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.280]   We're perfectly happy with them.
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.280]   We added this new thing.
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.280]   It's super.
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.280]   We're all about customers.
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:31.280]   So you know, they're getting it from ZO.
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:32.280]   Oh, we thought they're serious.
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:37.600]   It's the, we've, we've, the tablet, we can't like innovate on the form anymore.
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.600]   Yeah.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:42.480]   So I'm going to throw in a software feature that people will buzz about.
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:43.480]   Okay.
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.480]   I mean, yes, that's what I mean.
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.480]   Okay.
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:46.480]   Yeah.
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.480]   Yeah.
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:51.200]   No, I mean, it is a thing that they can put on a press release and we can lead buzz out
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:55.000]   loud with, you know, like it is, you don't work on a show anymore.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.720]   I get, I get, you know, sorry.
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:08:59.720]   Take your right back.
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.720]   I know.
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:07.320]   So yeah, it is a discussion point, but beyond, you know, tech pundit talking heads, is it
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:09.280]   something that anybody cares about?
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:13.960]   Well, do people look at Amazon outside of the Kindle and think great customer service?
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.240]   If, if so, then this is an extension of that belief, right?
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:21.960]   This is confirmation that not only do we provide excellent service and value online, but we
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:26.480]   also put that kind of energy into the mobile experience, which like you were saying earlier,
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:31.000]   is totally like the other side of what Google does, which is provide none of that.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   Exactly.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.720]   And that's perfect for the, that's perfect for the moms and the dads and the grandpas
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:40.640]   and the people that just don't really like ingest and involve themselves in the technology
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:43.080]   aspect of things all the time.
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.560]   That's, that's possibly good enough, but I don't know if it's enough to completely hinge
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:48.840]   sales around a holiday season around.
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:52.400]   It's just kind of what hardware manufacturers need to do right now that the hardware is
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.320]   hard to, to push any further.
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.880]   So what else can we do outside of that software service?
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:01.480]   I'll tell you what, what Natalie was saying about the like look it, look for it on Amazon
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:07.240]   thing, I think is a way more interesting and awesome solution for customer service, because
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:11.960]   they can send that to somebody that they can train that may not even speak English, that
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:16.800]   just knows, look for this, you know, type these letters into a machine, search for it
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.520]   on Amazon, and then send an email super quick.
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:23.800]   Like they can staff that in a way that I don't, it's going to be harder to staff somebody
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:29.200]   to look presentable and speak in a, in a way that's going to be.
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:33.560]   And don't forget that makes me think Mayday is going to be used not just for tech support,
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:34.560]   right?
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:38.480]   Not just for connectivity, not for how do I change my settings, but for I want to find
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.600]   this item in your store, Amazon, because Amazon's trying to make money off the Kindle by getting
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.600]   you to shop.
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:44.600]   They'll be providing that service.
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.440]   So it's just a shopping buddy?
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.440]   It's no, it's no holds, right?
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:49.440]   It's your Amazon.
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.440]   It's your Amazon.
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.440]   That's a really fun job though, actually.
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:55.280]   I'm just saying if you, if you're having trouble finding a job in Seattle, you need to
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.280]   shop for assistance.
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:00.400]   And I think that, that it is staffed in Seattle.
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:05.960]   I remember the last, that the last iteration of that, of that shopping buddy thing was staffed
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:06.960]   in Seattle.
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.160]   So I think they are probably English speakers.
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.320]   I mean, yeah, if they're, if they are.
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.320]   If they're.
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.320]   Yeah.
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.320]   If they're.
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:15.320]   Kidding.
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.320]   They're stoked about a lot of things, but otherwise.
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.320]   Bumper shoes instead of umbrellas.
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.320]   It's who we duck.
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.640]   That's how we say it.
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.080]   I do think though that it's cool.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:28.240]   I mean, I think if they staff it appropriately and you really can and you're online, you press
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:31.360]   this button, like if my mom could press this button.
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:34.520]   I think it's kind of, I mean, I think it's a neat value add.
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.120]   I don't think it's the, the be all and.
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.840]   I mean, like is it a demoable feature?
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:40.000]   Is it a demoable feature?
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Right.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.520]   I mean, I still did when my dad called me and said, Hey, I want to get a tablet, like
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:46.760]   a seven inch tablet.
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:51.000]   I said, get a Samsung Galaxy tab because I said, do you want to read books on it?
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.120]   No, I'm going to keep my Kindle because I like the e-reader and then I couldn't find
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:57.200]   a reason to recommend a Kindle fire to him.
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:01.520]   So it's not necessarily the feature that's going to put somebody over the top because
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:05.080]   I did not think to myself, my dad's going to need a solution for customer service.
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.760]   If only we were a little man inside the Kindle, I'd recommend that.
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:08.760]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:09.760]   Hey, I'm over here.
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.520]   I wish you could have a shopping putty with his new Kindle.
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:12.920]   That would be sweet.
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:16.560]   And also I'm just waiting for the morning shows to go Amazon can watch everything you
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.240]   do because they can get right into your tablet.
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:20.240]   That's going to happen.
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.360]   You forgot to turn it off.
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:25.920]   They made a big deal of how your camera is off by default to these people.
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.640]   They can't turn your camera on.
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.680]   Now whether people will trust that that's true or not.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.040]   But the NSA can.
[00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.040]   Well, yeah.
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.040]   Bum, bum, bum.
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.040]   Yeah.
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:35.040]   Sticky notes ready.
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.040]   Where do you think they're staffing?
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.040]   I have.
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.960]   It's not just the tablet.
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.760]   It's your best friend.
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:43.920]   And you take them everywhere you go.
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.400]   It's like Diamond Age.
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:50.320]   There probably is something we can come up with to talk about regarding Apple this
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.960]   week because there always is.
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:54.600]   There's like 12 stories in here.
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:13:00.920]   Apple's biggest two things that I could think of are the controversy quote unquote about
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:05.560]   sales figures have the is the iPhone 5s and 5cs success.
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:11.240]   And I think more interesting Tim Cooks rumored upcoming meeting with Carl Icahn on Monday.
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:17.040]   Where Carl Icahn is known as an activist investor who companies often fear and Tim Cook
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.840]   seems to be embracing him.
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.200]   Does the panel have a preference?
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.160]   Do we care about the iPhone sales?
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.320]   I think the sales are fine.
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.640]   I don't think they're indicative one way or another of whether Apple is in trouble or
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.640]   not.
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:32.520]   No, I think that I think most of the world is now programmed to purchase iPhones.
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:36.720]   And until such time as the programming wears off, it's not that.
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:37.720]   It's not that remarkable.
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:40.160]   It would be remarkable if they were not selling iPhones.
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:41.160]   Justin Ballwood.
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:42.160]   I bought one.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:43.160]   I forgot to say.
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:44.160]   Yeah.
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:45.160]   Yeah.
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.160]   Even programs.
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:47.160]   Here we go.
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:48.160]   Finally.
[00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.160]   Now talk back.
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.160]   No, yeah.
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.160]   I mean, I think-
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.400]   Wait, wait, you switched?
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:53.400]   No, I did.
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.400]   Although I did.
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:59.040]   I had an Android and then I stopped using an Android because my five got stolen.
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:03.000]   So I had a stopgap Android and then I bought the 5s when it came out.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.840]   Oh, see that doesn't totally count.
[00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:05.840]   No, it doesn't.
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:06.840]   You had to get a phone.
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:10.800]   I did have to get a phone and I was really excited and I do enjoy it.
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:11.800]   But-
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:12.800]   Can you make it do the thing?
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:13.800]   The what?
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:14.800]   I think-
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:15.800]   Can you-
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:16.800]   I'll tell you-
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:17.800]   Can you finger?
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:18.800]   I can finger it.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:19.800]   Boom.
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:20.800]   It just got fingered.
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:21.800]   Is that inappropriate?
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:22.800]   Yeah.
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.600]   Not if you don't make it inappropriate.
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.600]   Okay, good.
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:26.600]   I'm sorry.
[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.200]   I can explain it to Lucy, right?
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.200]   Oh, sure.
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:30.200]   Yes.
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.200]   No, I agree with your toe.
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.360]   Now we'll really get there.
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:43.040]   I agree that it is not the story that it would be if sales figures were really down.
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:48.000]   You know, it is something that is on the trajectory and we can talk about whether or
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.600]   not it is as big as the numbers initially seem to be.
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:57.520]   But I agree with you that there's not really anything here that we can say like, well, obviously
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:03.440]   they're in gigantic trouble or obviously this is what it was four years ago where it
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.600]   was absolutely just dominating everything.
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:06.600]   Yeah.
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:07.600]   It is what it is.
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:08.600]   It's an iPhone.
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:09.600]   It's on sale.
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.600]   It's sold about as many or maybe a little bit more than the last one or something like
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.600]   that.
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:13.600]   I think that is interesting.
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.600]   That's interesting.
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:15.920]   I don't know what's going on there.
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:16.920]   That is really interesting.
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:18.080]   It could be a lot of things.
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:23.560]   I think it could be a change in Carl Icahn saying, I'm no longer going to go after the
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:24.560]   chaff.
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.640]   I want to go after some wheat.
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:30.000]   And I think Apple is the right kind of wheat for me to go after.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.400]   Well, can we get a...
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.400]   I'm making bread.
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:37.840]   Can we get a brief summarization on Carl Icahn for those people who don't or not aware
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:38.840]   of his history?
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:42.440]   Activist investor, probably most people remember him from insider trading in the 80s.
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:43.440]   Which he escaped from.
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.440]   He did not get in...
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:47.160]   I don't think he was ever prosecuted.
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:51.320]   He still feels like he's pushed in the line though because Carl Icahn is the guy who tweeted
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:54.800]   very recently, like, "How did a great conversation with Tim?
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.160]   Everybody should buy Apple.
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.760]   I already bought a ton."
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:58.760]   Yeah.
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:15:59.760]   And then Apple stock went...
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:00.760]   Yeah.
[00:16:00.760 --> 00:16:02.800]   Like, had a massive spike and everybody was like, "Is that legal?
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.600]   Are you allowed to say that I had a really good meeting with Tim Cook and then I bought
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:06.600]   a bunch of Apple stocks too?"
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:07.600]   That's outsider trading.
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:08.600]   Yeah.
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.600]   That's just like the most obvious and then I'll make a bunch of money after you buy the
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:12.600]   stocks, so thanks for that.
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:13.600]   It's wrong.
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:17.160]   Well, if you don't dump, then the pump is okay.
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:18.160]   I think.
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:19.160]   Yeah.
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:20.560]   Isn't this also kind of a pump?
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.440]   Can it be like insider cheerleading?
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:28.200]   To finish for those who don't understand, Carl Icahn with Yahoo and with Dell kind of
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:31.480]   weighted in at their most troubled moment and messed with them.
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:32.480]   And Marvel too.
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:33.480]   Yep.
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:34.480]   Yep.
[00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:35.480]   Great example.
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.000]   Dell most recently, Michael Dell had the deal.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.400]   He was going to take the company private.
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:39.880]   He had the equity investors.
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:43.480]   He was all done and Carl Icahn comes in and goes, "I don't think that's a very good deal."
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:47.360]   And cause trouble, got the stock price to rise, made some money off of it.
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.000]   That's usually his MO.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   So what he's doing with Apple?
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.520]   Well, that's why it's interesting because his MO is usually you're in trouble.
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:54.520]   Yes.
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:17:00.120]   But maybe they are in trouble not in reality but stock price-wise because there has been
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:01.120]   a decline.
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:04.480]   And maybe on the Carl Icahn spreadsheet, it's like, "I don't care if Apple's truly in trouble
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:07.800]   or not, but here's a stock price that is inclined by the percentage that triggers off
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:08.800]   my alerts."
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.600]   That means I go in and buy it and try to get it to lift back up.
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:12.600]   Right.
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:16.040]   And there's no question that Apple's stock price has suffered a decline that Apple seems
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:20.720]   to think is unfair, that Tim Cook has said is the result of a lot of misunderstanding.
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:26.560]   What's interesting to me though is that he is so publicly taking meetings with Carl Icahn,
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:30.240]   which is, it's like one of those things where it's good and bad.
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:33.000]   I mean, Carl Icahn obviously is the only one tweeting about how he's going to have-
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   Right.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   And it's not like I could put up a press release or-
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   Right.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.760]   Apple's not like, "Oh, we're seeking the advice of Carl Icahn to make sure that our stock
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:39.960]   price is where it's going to be."
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:45.720]   But it still does seem to suggest an openness to outside ideas that was previously lacking
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:49.720]   at Apple and/or, "Oh my God, we need to plan bad."
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:51.880]   Well, I mean, is it just a binary thing with Icahn?
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:52.880]   I mean, we need that.
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:53.880]   Sorry, Natalie, go ahead.
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.880]   Oh, I just- we need to plan bad.
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:18:00.720]   I mean, this was pre-product launch, this meeting or this tweeting and all of that stuff.
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:04.600]   I mean, they did almost double their sales this year from the last one, like, "Nine
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.800]   million is nothing to sneeze at."
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:12.980]   So I don't know, there's this sort of misconception or I don't know if there's a- we're not exactly
[00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:18.000]   sure how to think of this sometimes because it's not like the hot, cool thing, but it's
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.080]   hardly hurting for sales.
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.720]   These were still impressive sales.
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:26.320]   Well, it is nothing to sneeze at unless you record that sneeze in this awesome new slow-motion
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:27.320]   feature.
[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:28.320]   Right.
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:33.280]   I'm- I'm- the meeting- there is a meeting that you're right at, Natalie, already happened.
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:37.640]   I'm referring to Apple CEO Tim Cook will meet with Carl Icahn next week with a story on
[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:38.640]   Friday.
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.080]   So there's another meeting coming up.
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:44.400]   So that doesn't change much of what we're talking about here, but this is an ongoing
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.400]   relationship.
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.480]   They are- Maybe their kids play soccer together.
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:48.480]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:49.880]   Maybe they just like you.
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:52.680]   Well, I mean- Maybe their definitely- Maybe their basketball buddy.
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:56.160]   This is a budding business relationship for whatever reason.
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.520]   I don't think it is a bat to be clear.
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:01.680]   I don't think it's a bad idea for Tim Cook to take meetings with Carl Icahn.
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.240]   I think that's a great idea.
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:10.080]   Their stock has suffered, whether it's unfair or not, they have been in trouble to that
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:11.080]   extent.
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:12.080]   They feel like they're in trouble.
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:13.080]   They're not, right?
[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:17.200]   They've got bajillion- and that's what's so interesting is on the one hand, not in trouble.
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:20.880]   Stock went way up after the announcement of the 9 million phones sold.
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:24.800]   They still have more money than Detroit, way more, right?
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:26.600]   More cash than Detroit in some other countries.
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:27.600]   Yeah.
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:28.600]   Yeah.
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:29.600]   They can finally build their Robocop.
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.840]   Apple could build Robocop, probably.
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:32.840]   And probably have tried.
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:38.920]   Nevertheless, given Carl Icahn's history as an investor who comes along to help out companies
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:43.240]   that are in trouble, it's just an interesting- It's hard not to apply that historical perspective
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:46.960]   to the fact that he's meeting with Tim Cook at a time when everybody's like, "Is Apple
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:47.960]   still cool?"
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:48.960]   Yeah.
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:52.560]   It's all like, of course, it's inevitable hand-ringing, but it doesn't make it not interesting.
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:54.400]   He's the maggot that cleans the wound.
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:55.400]   Ew.
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:56.400]   Oh.
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.400]   Exactly, right?
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:58.400]   I'll eat our dish.
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:00.400]   When you have a really- What are you talking about?
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.800]   I see Dell wound, you understand.
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:03.800]   Yeah.
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.960]   But it still- Right, but it makes you go, "Is there a wound?"
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:06.960]   Right.
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.960]   It is inevitable for you to see these meetings happening, though.
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:09.960]   Exactly.
[00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:10.960]   Is there a problem?
[00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:15.520]   And that's- Okay, but number one, the idea that a CEO of any company, let alone Apple,
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:20.360]   would take meetings with investors is really not news, because you would assume that they
[00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:22.720]   are meeting with people- I'm sure.
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.160]   That there are meetings all the time with people.
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:26.400]   A, we know about it.
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:32.800]   The Carl Icahn is who he is, but I don't know what that necessarily says.
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:37.800]   I don't know if that is anything to read into, besides the fact that now all I can think
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:40.120]   of is Steve Jobs coming back as RoboCop.
[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:41.120]   Ew.
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:47.280]   All I can think of is maggots, but you have to admit that Carl Icahn is very publicly
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:48.280]   having- Yeah.
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.280]   He is delive and- Yeah, I'll delete.
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:51.280]   He's leaving.
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:52.280]   He's leaving.
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:53.280]   He's leaving.
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:54.280]   He's leaving.
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:55.280]   He's not coming meeting.
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:56.280]   Right.
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:59.520]   And part of it is that- I mean, part of it, to be clear, may not be trouble related at
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:00.520]   all.
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:03.960]   It's that most investors, including Carl Icahn, want a stock buyback.
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:04.960]   What day was that tweet?
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:08.400]   Like a huge amount of this was reported September 26.
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:09.400]   Okay, yeah.
[00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:11.920]   Oh, no, this is when he tweeted last month about the upcoming meeting.
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:14.280]   So that was the last meeting on the- Okay, let's see what he says again.
[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:15.280]   I'm curious.
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.280]   It could be partly just a shakedown.
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:17.280]   Maybe he's trying to pump his super pump.
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:20.040]   I mean, it could be a Carl Icahn shakedown, and he's like, "Listen, I'm going to pump
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:21.920]   your stock, and then I want to buy back you bastard."
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:22.920]   Yeah, no, absolutely.
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:24.720]   Because that's what all the shareholders want.
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:25.720]   Yeah.
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:30.040]   Carl Icahn does famously his come in and advocate for the things that is good for a shareholder
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.240]   that the CEO is resisting.
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:32.240]   Yeah.
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:33.240]   And that's exactly what's going on here.
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:35.920]   Just isn't as dramatic as the company's failing, right?
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:39.800]   No, I mean, the company's not- If I were Apple, I would keep doing exactly what I'm doing.
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:40.800]   Just do what you're doing.
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:41.800]   It's all fine.
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.240]   Programming is working.
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.320]   Programming is working.
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:49.600]   We need to take a break and thank one of our programming sponsors here at Twit, Shutterstock.
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:54.400]   This is actually relevant to Molly Wood because this episode is brought to you by Shutterstock.com.
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:58.440]   I don't know if you know this, but the images that I put on Insta-thing.me always got to
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:21:59.440]   get them from Shutterstock.
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:01.440]   Oh, because you got the thing you did on the discount.
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:04.040]   Because when we had- I'm like, "I need multicolored cronuts.
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.040]   Where am I going to get that?"
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.040]   Shutterstock.
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:07.040]   Shutterstock.
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:10.140]   Seriously, you type in multicolored cronuts, and you get a picture of different colored
[00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:11.140]   cronuts.
[00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:13.480]   And that's impressive because cronuts are really hard to find, so-
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:14.480]   We have a whole episode about it.
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:17.280]   Did you know actually my fantasy football team is called the cronuts, scalpers?
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:18.280]   Nice.
[00:22:18.280 --> 00:22:22.440]   Shutterstock.com, you will find the perfect image or video.
[00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:25.400]   I'm actually going to make a book trailer out of their videos, I think.
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.880]   For your next creative project, whether it's your website, like in my case, or you got
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:33.640]   a publication, an advertisement, a video, any type of project, you choose from over
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:37.040]   28 million high quality stock photos, illustrations, vectors.
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:40.240]   Vectors means you can resize it and it doesn't lose its resolution.
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.240]   Video clips.
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:46.360]   Shutterstock adds 10,000 images every day, and they're good images because they review
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:49.000]   those cronut images and say, "Is that in-factor cronut?
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.560]   Does it look like a tasty cronut?
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:51.560]   That is a tasty looking cronut.
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:52.560]   We're putting that in."
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:53.560]   They don't slow down.
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:54.840]   They have good quality images.
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:56.360]   They're always getting bigger.
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:59.720]   You choose individual image packs or a monthly subscription for the best deal.
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:03.720]   You can download 25 images a day with the standard subscription.
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.760]   I only need one for it to think.
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:08.000]   I can go a lot, but a lot more if I wanted.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.280]   You can download any image in any size and pay only one price.
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:15.080]   Shutterstock recently partnered with Facebook, so if you're advertising on Facebook, you get
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:17.800]   free access to all its images through Facebook's ad creation tool.
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:22.000]   It's a great resource for local businesses that want professional looking ads.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.640]   You don't have to take a single word that I just said to heart.
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:28.200]   All you got to do is go try Shutterstock out for free right now.
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:30.160]   You don't have to give them a credit card.

[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:38.320]   Save your favorite images to a light box.
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:39.360]   You can review them later.

[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:54.840]   We thank Shutterstock for their support of This Week in Tech.
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:55.840]   Shall we...
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:24:00.000]   Is it too early to play this week on the fun things that happened?
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.120]   We're going to get into some Microsoft Surface Talk.
[00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:05.320]   We've also want to talk about that Steam box, but let's find out what happened on TWIT.
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:10.320]   This week in tech, previously on TWIT, triangulation.
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:14.320]   For almost 10 years, I played C3PO.
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:17.920]   Wait, is the side gate at four as the Lucasfilm employees?
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:20.960]   So if there was Burger King commercial, they put you in the suit.
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:21.960]   Yes.
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:22.960]   This week in Enterprise Tech.
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.560]   Here's a tool I've been working on.
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:26.160]   It's called browser pivoting.
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:29.040]   I'm going to inject myself as the attacker.
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:34.360]   Now I'm able to go through this web application that the user authenticated to without them
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:35.360]   know it.
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:36.360]   Home Theater Geeks.
[00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:43.560]   On today's special episode of Home Theater Geeks, we are calibrating Leo's OLED TV.
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:47.600]   The thing that I've used the most is the slow-mo camera.
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:49.800]   Oh, that hurt.
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.640]   Oh my god.
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:55.120]   Yeah, no, that's not an attractive look.
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:56.120]   TWIT.
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:57.120]   Bring your brain.
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:58.120]   We'll do the rest.
[00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:01.600]   Can I do that to you?
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:02.800]   I don't know here.
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:03.800]   Can I...
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:06.480]   I'll slow-mo you, slow-moing me.
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:07.480]   That seems hard.
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:08.480]   Slow-mo you.
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.480]   This is great.
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:12.480]   Anyone watch the video just thinks you think you think you think you think you think.
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.480]   He's like, "Oh."
[00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:22.880]   Let's talk about the Microsoft Surface announcements.
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:25.720]   Surface Pro 2 and the Surface 2.
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:31.240]   The Surface Pro 2 is the successor to the Surface Pro and it has better specs and it's
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:32.920]   fancier and a little slimmer.
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:37.320]   The Surface 2 is the successor to the Windows RT tablet.
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:41.960]   So they took the RT out of it, but it's still the RT operating system in there.
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:42.960]   Everybody caught up?
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:43.960]   Yeah.
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:44.960]   Good.
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:45.960]   Yeah.
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:46.960]   Okay.
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:49.080]   The Tiger 4 processor in the Surface 2 improved battery life $449.
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:55.400]   I think the Surface Pro 2 is easier to explain because they've sold them.
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:59.800]   Most of the manufacturers who got on board with the Surface Pro are still making Surface
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:02.760]   Pro so they're likely to do some Surface Pro 2 type stuff.
[00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:04.400]   I mean the Windows 8 tablets.
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:08.040]   Which was the better reviewed of the two initial.
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:11.480]   Nobody's making Windows RT tablets anymore except Microsoft, but they're still right
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:12.480]   in the source.
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:13.480]   Is that smart?
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.480]   No.
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:18.680]   I mean, you're going to ask me.
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:19.680]   Anybody?
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:21.080]   I just don't understand.
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.880]   Doesn't seem smart.
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:24.320]   I don't understand.
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:27.520]   I don't know why it didn't sell.
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:29.400]   It's still $449.
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:34.280]   I mean, I am at a lot cheaper than the cheapest iPad.
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:36.480]   $550 or something, right?
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:37.480]   Yeah.
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:39.560]   It does most of the things.
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:43.080]   It may not have all the apps, but it does not have all the apps.
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:44.080]   You can get.
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.080]   No, I know it does.
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:46.840]   I mean, I think that is a perception problem.
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:49.280]   And I think that's a really hard one to overcome, right?
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:53.360]   Like, people say, "But does it do the things that my iPad does or that my friends iPad
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:54.360]   does?"
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:59.560]   Or it's just an easier sell versus, "Well, the Surface looks totally different from anything
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:00.560]   that you've used before.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:01.560]   It doesn't have all the same apps.
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:03.240]   It has most of the ones you're probably going to...
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:04.240]   I don't know.
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:05.240]   Who...
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:06.240]   I don't know.
[00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:09.920]   I feel like I am unfairly biased because I used it and just could not.
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:11.000]   I thought it was got off.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.160]   I have a Surface RT and I love the hardware.
[00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:15.960]   This is exactly the same way I felt about the playbook.
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:16.960]   I love the hardware.
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:20.240]   I actually love the QNX operating system on the Blackberry playbook.
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:23.320]   The Windows RT operating system is okay.
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:27.440]   It frustrates me because A, I'm like, "Okay, I need an IRC app."
[00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:32.680]   And then I can pay $3 for an app or I can get a free one that just doesn't work very well.
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:34.080]   It's better than it was.
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:35.160]   They have an official Twitter app.
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:37.040]   They always had a great Netflix app.
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:38.760]   So it depends on what your app needs are.
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:42.440]   But then you go to that desktop and you're like, "Oh, I have a desktop and I have a second
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:45.520]   browser and I have the ability to do office but only in the desktop."
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:47.400]   And the desktop interface doesn't work very well on touchscreen.
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:51.240]   I frankly think they should have not done the desktop on Windows RT.
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:55.240]   I don't know why they did desktop on Windows RT because actually the tiles are attractive.
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:57.640]   It is overwhelming and the tiles are completely confusing.
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:00.880]   And if you don't have very many apps on there, it's just sort of a mess of what looks like
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.800]   ads, to be honest, because you're like, "I don't know what this content is.
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:05.680]   It's not anything that I put on here."
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:08.680]   But then have a desktop on there is completely baffling.
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:09.680]   Completely baffling.
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:12.720]   And I know every time I used it, I made the like, I did the accidental little Windows
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:15.880]   split thing and then I could never get the Windows back.
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:19.440]   I think you probably get used to that if you really committed to using it.
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:20.440]   Yeah.
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:21.440]   Yeah.
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:25.800]   I think your sort of muscle memory starts to remember that once you have that happening
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.000]   and I still think it's too early to give up.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.800]   I mean, they've got their, you know, cost function and their production function.
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:36.240]   You know what supply, demand and how much they can afford to lose for however much more
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:37.400]   they push.
[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:42.160]   So I think that I think if we would fault them for giving up on this by now, I think.
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:43.160]   What else has?
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:46.120]   I don't know if anyone else should just be very stubborn.
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:48.280]   I for one would applaud them for giving up.
[00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:50.800]   I would applaud them for failing faster on RT.
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:51.800]   I really would.
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:54.680]   I do think that it's okay to fail fast on one version.
[00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:57.320]   It's possible that, I mean, look, the surface for all.
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:58.320]   RT, right.
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:00.800]   Maybe that's an investment in the future that we completely understand.
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:05.720]   So I give you that, but I'm talking about in general, like, you know, second generation.
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:07.440]   I still think it's too early.
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:11.840]   Well, I mean, is this them not wanting to give up the ghost on the lower price point,
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:14.520]   which would be more of a consumer facing advice?
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:15.800]   I think that's it.
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.840]   I think they look at the atom or they look at the atom processor exactly.
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:22.240]   They look at the atom processor and they're like, nobody's building for that yet.
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:26.040]   So we're going to continue to go on arm processors because that's where you keep the price
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:30.760]   point down and we can have a $449 tablet out there and say, Hey, guess what?
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:34.920]   You can get a tablet that runs Windows and does all the great Windows things like Office
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:38.040]   and you can't get that from Apple and they're going to charge you more.
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.720]   That's been their marketing pitch and they're going to continue to do that.
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:44.240]   But I think it is just marketing pitch until you talk about the surface pro two.
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.880]   And Natalie, that's where I do agree with you.
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:50.480]   If we're talking about the surface pro two, even at $899 with a Haswell processor, you've
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:51.780]   got great battery life.
[00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:56.680]   You get all the Windows things now that they have this dock that they announced and
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:30:00.400]   it can actually be not just your tablet, but your desktop as well.
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:05.520]   All of a sudden that seems to be the other end of the scale from the surface and I think
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:08.400]   there's nothing wrong with saying we have a premium product, right?
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:10.120]   Apple's gotten away with that for a long time.
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:14.240]   I would lean into the surface pro two and I would say this is a device that will that's
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:18.720]   better than a MacBook Air, for example, because it's smaller, it's more portable and it's
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:21.080]   a full version of Windows and it's at least 200.
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:23.600]   I would love to see the pro two at 799.
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:26.640]   I think that would be a super compelling price point.
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:29.440]   But I that is a good machine.
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:34.800]   The surface RT has so much explaining to do that it doesn't make sense to say you have
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:35.800]   a cheaper thing.
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:36.800]   You're just confusing your market.
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:40.120]   Is that Microsoft at that point kind of giving up on the consumer side of things and maybe
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:43.560]   targeting more for business because it's more expensive and designed for that.
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:44.560]   I don't think so though.
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:45.560]   I don't think it'll happen.
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:48.120]   Don't you see their advertising during NFL Sundays and stuff?
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:54.080]   So I thought so first too, but I see a lot of a lot of surface commercials and programming
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:55.680]   that I wouldn't otherwise expect.
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:31:00.120]   Well, but it's like deliver the quality and the functionality and people will pay the
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:01.480]   premium for it.
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:05.440]   And that is I think what we're seeing is two different philosophies and Microsoft doesn't
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:11.880]   want to give up on the idea that price point and you know a checklist of things that the
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:16.960]   surface can do versus an iPad mini for example will sell devices and I don't think I think
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:22.080]   that they are more on the right path with the pro where it just hey look, let's let's compare
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.520]   this to an air.
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:27.080]   Let's say if you are a Windows user now you don't have to think about giving up what you
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:28.080]   normally do.
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:31.480]   Here's this new device that will solve a lot of problems for you.
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:35.520]   And here's the price that you have to justify in your mind to spend on it.
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:40.040]   It's an ultra portable laptop and it's a fun touchscreen device.
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:43.880]   It's a really cool tablet and yes, it costs more and they're just distracting themselves
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:45.680]   by trying to pitch them both.
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:46.680]   They confuse it.
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:51.600]   I mean, I dare you to find a sort of an average consumer who can tell you what the difference
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.600]   between the RT and the pro is.
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:58.640]   I think dropping RT from the name is an effort to try to reduce the confusion and I think
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:02.240]   it does the opposite because suddenly you say, oh, there's the surface and the surface
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:07.640]   pro they must be the same thing but one of them is just a little beefier for the professional
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:08.640]   user.
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:12.520]   Yeah, and they're not they're not the same operating system or or as long as we're having
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:16.800]   both out loud deja vu, this is exactly the conversation we've been having for years
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:19.720]   about the way they tear their operating system.
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:25.160]   So when are they going to understand that like the new windows, this titles are really
[00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:26.160]   confusing.
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:27.160]   No, it's exactly right.
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:28.160]   It is right.
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:29.160]   It's the same conversation as it is.
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.160]   There's seven of them.
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:31.160]   There's seven versions of Windows Vista.
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:32.160]   Exactly.
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:37.880]   This is just a we this is like a strange brain groove that Microsoft cannot get out of that
[00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:40.080]   they feel like they've got to have all these different options.
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:41.080]   What is that?
[00:32:41.080 --> 00:32:44.040]   Is less than two are show.
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:47.000]   But I mean, like is they do it for us?
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.920]   Will the mark of the next leadership regime for Microsoft be judged on whether or not they
[00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:56.640]   can solve this problem or make it substantially different?
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:00.960]   Like is is the change in in blood?
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:05.720]   I would say I mean, you would have to say this is the this is the big recurring problem
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:12.040]   for them in terms of a consumer focused like new world that they have found themselves
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:13.040]   in.
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:14.840]   Simplify, simplify, simplify.
[00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:15.840]   Yeah.
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:19.000]   Because I mean, like this kind of stuff you can get away with if you're selling enterprise,
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   right?
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   You can get away with if you're doing these gigantic orders for businesses.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.440]   And have teams that are going to research those things and find out exactly what those
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:28.000]   different sources are and why do you versus not.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.200]   Yeah, because because one more thing about the service thing, because if you look at
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:35.040]   the price point difference and people are understanding they're used to looking at iPads
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:40.440]   and an a iPad costs this much money and then the more expensive, you know, by a hundred
[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:43.440]   and fifty or two hundred dollars version just has more memory.
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:48.120]   That is not a metaphor that Microsoft wants to deal with when their higher price model
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:50.280]   has so much more functionality.
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:54.080]   So people like, well, look at this and say, well, why would I pay this extra, you know,
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:58.240]   X amount or think that these two surfaces are the same thing just because they're named
[00:33:58.240 --> 00:34:02.120]   the same thing and they're separated by a couple hundred dollars and they're not there.
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:07.200]   They're two completely different devices and one by all accounts is good and one sucks.
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:11.800]   Nalt in the chat room says windows and windows pro easy, but windows still let you run all
[00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:15.760]   the apps you wanted on which platform and which apps that's where it gets that's where
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:20.520]   the problem is they're both called windows and windows pro on the surface means something
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:24.280]   different than windows pro on the desktop because all the versions of windows that I
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:29.040]   buy for the desktop can run all the same apps for the most part, ninety nine percent, but
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:33.480]   not both the windows that I buy with the surface can run all the same apps unless they're in
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:36.520]   the tiled interface in which they can, but did I buy the tiled interface?
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:39.400]   No, I didn't because I think that's annoying.
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:46.200]   And also really, I mean, really that your value proposition to a consumers.
[00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:48.800]   Well, it's all called windows other than that.
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:50.200]   It's a total show.
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:52.720]   Well, the fixed show.
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:54.800]   It's a very quiet show.
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:59.600]   The fixed for that is Microsoft saying, look, eventually we want all the apps to work on
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:00.600]   all the platforms.
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:05.080]   We don't care if it's windows phone or a surface and let's leave aside the fact that
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:08.200]   that is almost impossible given what they have with arm.
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:12.320]   Let's say they do ditch arm and now they say, okay, you'll have tiled interface apps only
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:15.400]   on the phone and those will run on windows on your desktop and then that will also have
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:16.400]   desktop apps as well.
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.160]   Is that a good idea?
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:19.160]   Do we want that?
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:20.760]   Yes, I think we do.
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:21.760]   I think we do.
[00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:25.400]   Because if you think about how that would work in the Apple universe that you could update
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:30.320]   certain apps inside of your desktop experience, I think that's why this story on the verge
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:33.640]   about how they're working on a universal app store.
[00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:35.640]   Yeah, I think that's a really good idea.
[00:35:35.640 --> 00:35:37.880]   If it works, I think it's really hard to do.
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:41.640]   Oh, like you said, it's really, yeah, I mean, Natalie, you're absolutely right.
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:46.480]   It sounds so promising and it would be so seamless for users, which is exactly the thing
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:50.520]   that Microsoft has been promising its users now for nine on 15 years, I think.
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:54.960]   I mean, I remember Bill Gates coming to eat three, 10 years ago and talking about how
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:59.540]   windows was finally going to extend to Xbox and you would have a gamer tag that was available
[00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:02.400]   to you across your devices and across all your platforms.
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:06.280]   I mean, they cannot figure out this integration thing and there have been a million different
[00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:12.000]   exposés on Microsoft that talk about why that they foster internal competition instead
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.360]   of platforms and divisions working together.
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:15.360]   The entire--
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:16.720]   I think Apple hasn't figured it out either.
[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:21.120]   So, you know, we've been talking, I remember when every time there's a rumor about an Apple
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:25.320]   TV update, we're thinking apps on the Apple TV and it hasn't really happened yet.
[00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:27.400]   I don't think it's as easy as we think it.
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:28.960]   I mean, I don't think we all think it's easy.
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:30.640]   Well, you've got different interfaces.
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:31.640]   Right.
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:32.640]   You've got different capabilities.
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:34.640]   You've got different instruction sets.
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:38.560]   It's a really difficult thing and I almost feel like, yeah, of course, I would love a
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:42.280]   land where I buy an app and I can use it on any device.
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:43.280]   Right.
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:44.760]   You know, because I'm living in that universe, right?
[00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:45.760]   I would actually prefer it.
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:46.760]   You would have.
[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:47.760]   Where I buy an app and I use it on any device.
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:52.000]   It doesn't matter who manufactured it since we're talking about crazy lands.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:58.680]   And I just, you know, when you create Photoshop for the desktop, you can't really do Photoshop
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:36:59.680]   for the phone.
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:01.160]   You have to do a different program.
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:04.840]   This was just, it's a universal app like iPad where it's actually two different apps.
[00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:06.680]   But when you buy one, you get the other.
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:09.600]   And maybe it doesn't, it's true that maybe it doesn't matter.
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:13.440]   Maybe this is a dream that has been planted in our heads that we actually just need to
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:18.240]   give up on because the use cases for these devices are different that I get that I am
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:22.920]   okay with the fact that there are things I do on my desktop that I do not need to do
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:24.720]   on my tablet or my phone.
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:25.720]   That's okay.
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:26.720]   I do have like it.
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:29.320]   I would like it if my gamer tag rank would follow me.
[00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:30.800]   That would be if we could get that eventually.
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:32.960]   Those seem like the easier wins.
[00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:34.480]   Those seem like the easy wins exactly.
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:35.760]   So focus on the easy wins.
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:41.160]   There are certain things that are well integrated on the Apple platforms, obviously, like iTunes.
[00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:42.160]   Yeah.
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:44.000]   There are ways that I play like I message.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:50.360]   Although I message seems totally broken in iOS, evidence, making me furious.
[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:51.840]   But that's a different conversation.
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:56.720]   But maybe give up on trying to integrate everything and just do the platform things well.
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:02.080]   But we see a lot of people trying to even the new Dropbox solution and trying to get
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:06.920]   people to sign on with their solution and different devices within one operating system
[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:08.600]   and then across operating systems.
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:12.280]   So there's still people innovating in this that I mean the technology goes beyond my
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:13.640]   scope of understanding.
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:17.560]   But I do think that I think that it's too early to dream to.
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:18.800]   I'm not giving up on anything.
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:19.800]   I know.
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:20.800]   It's not only you're so great.
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:21.800]   You're totally the positive one today.
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:22.800]   You're like, no, things are okay.
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:23.800]   Damn it.
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:24.800]   You're like the Louis CK.
[00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:25.800]   Everything is fine.
[00:38:25.800 --> 00:38:26.800]   What are you complaining about?
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:27.800]   In the future.
[00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:28.800]   Stop complaining.
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:30.800]   We're only complaining because otherwise we don't have a job.
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:31.800]   I'm complaining because Steve.
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:34.440]   If it's ever land, I will play the part of Tinkerville.
[00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:35.440]   Love it.
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.520]   Well, this will bring you down.
[00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:38.040]   Steve Balmer crying on stage.
[00:38:38.040 --> 00:38:39.040]   Aww.
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:40.040]   No, guys.
[00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:44.280]   This was Microsoft's annual meeting and it's the last time Steve Balmer will get up in front
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:48.000]   of the entire company happened last week.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:51.680]   There's a little bit of video that's been leaked out on the internet.
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:59.520]   And I am not immune to wanting to poke fun at the man because he is hilarious in his
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:01.280]   trumping and stomping.
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:04.960]   But you really, when you watch this video, when you read about this, you don't get it
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:08.640]   as much when you watch this video and you see that Steve Balmer is really, really tearing
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:09.640]   up here.
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:11.120]   Go ahead and play a little bit of it.
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:16.640]   It's a song that comes at the very end of a movie where one of the actors gets up on
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:22.560]   stage and talks about kind of how he likes to do things.
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:27.160]   Well, I want to end with this song.
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:28.320]   Respectful.
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:35.200]   A song that talks about what you've met to me and what you've done for me.
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:39.360]   You've made this the time of my life.
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:40.360]   [applause]
[00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:43.360]   He's not putting that on.
[00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:44.360]   He's changing.
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:45.360]   Yeah.
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:46.360]   No.
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:48.360]   And I love it.
[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:49.360]   I was laughing.
[00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:50.360]   Not necessarily.
[00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:54.360]   We're just nervous laughing because it's so earnest that we can't take it.
[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:55.360]   Yeah, right.
[00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:57.360]   Like a actual raw emotion that it's like this.
[00:39:57.360 --> 00:39:58.360]   How about that?
[00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:01.360]   Also, I thought maybe he was going to run off the stage and do the leap.
[00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:02.360]   Yes.
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:03.360]   Do the leap.
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:04.840]   Or possibly throw a chair.
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:06.600]   I was a ceremonial chair.
[00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:07.600]   No, I'm so lift.
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:08.600]   I think it is for me to say.
[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:09.600]   Yeah, no, no, no.
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:10.600]   No, no, no.
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:11.600]   No one puts like Balmer in the corner.
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:12.600]   We know.
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:16.340]   Bill Gates is going to run up on stage and they're going to lift it up as they've been
[00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:17.340]   practicing in the water.
[00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:19.160]   It'd be Bill Gates out there.
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:20.160]   Right.
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:21.160]   Exactly.
[00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:23.160]   But let's be honest, doesn't that...
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:26.840]   I'm trying to formulate this in a way that won't make me sound like a totally cynical
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:27.840]   monster.
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:28.840]   However...
[00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:29.840]   Too late.
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:34.880]   I live in this so just stipulate that I'm playing the role of cynical monster for a
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:35.880]   minute.
[00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:41.140]   But we do live in this sort of like jaded hipster world where everybody sort of just wants
[00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:46.120]   everything to be cool and way more indie and way hipper than Alaska.
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:47.300]   And that's why Apple's so popular.
[00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:53.540]   And then here's a guy who in all earnestness plays that Patrick Swayze.
[00:40:53.540 --> 00:40:54.540]   No, that...
[00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:55.540]   As in...
[00:40:55.540 --> 00:41:01.820]   Unironically, like Microsoft is unironic and that may be the very problem.
[00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:04.100]   Like they just have no grasp of coolitude.
[00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:05.100]   I mean, all right.
[00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:07.580]   I think like there's only so much we can read into this.
[00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:10.220]   Wait, I'm wondering if there's a assumption that this is not cool?
[00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:11.220]   Yeah.
[00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:12.220]   Pat Swayze is getting dirty dancing.
[00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:14.220]   I want to be totally, I want to be totally clear.
[00:41:14.220 --> 00:41:15.220]   It's a kind of cool.
[00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:16.220]   This was great.
[00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:23.060]   And this was a window into kind of why Steve Bomber is Steve Bomber, why we enjoy him, why
[00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:29.360]   no matter what anybody thinks about Microsoft or his tenure at Microsoft, nobody like when
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:33.440]   the headline comes in on Twitter, Steve Bomber does something.
[00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:34.640]   Nobody doesn't click.
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:40.580]   Nobody watching this show buzz out loud doesn't click on that link.
[00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:42.940]   And he loves Microsoft.
[00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:43.940]   He does.
[00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:45.940]   I mean, that is super admirable.
[00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:50.820]   It was just a very interesting cultural moment.
[00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:55.580]   Do you think that they would have like an image consultant to be like, "Okay, let me explain
[00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:56.820]   to you what you can?"
[00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:58.980]   Let's find a Lil Wayne song that works.
[00:41:58.980 --> 00:41:59.980]   Yeah.
[00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:00.980]   This is moment instead.
[00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:01.980]   Right.
[00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:02.980]   And he's like, "No, I'm still CEO."
[00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:03.980]   Yeah.
[00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:04.980]   And right, exactly.
[00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:06.180]   And like you've got in apples like they got...
[00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:08.220]   They had Chris Martin for God's sake play.
[00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:12.700]   But didn't he say something like they told me before I couldn't do this?
[00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:13.700]   Yeah.
[00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:17.860]   I know that he was never able to play it because he was inappropriate for each.
[00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:18.860]   I guess he's been...
[00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:21.380]   Which is another thing that's just amazing when he's talking about it.
[00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:22.380]   When he's trying.
[00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:23.380]   Exactly.
[00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:24.940]   And he's having his arguments with the public relations staff.
[00:42:24.940 --> 00:42:25.940]   Okay.
[00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:27.020]   And then we can end with Tom...
[00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:28.020]   Tom, Tom, my life?
[00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:29.020]   Can we play Tom, my life?
[00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:30.020]   I'm finally going to do it.
[00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:31.020]   Yeah.
[00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:32.020]   I've been talking about it for years.
[00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:33.020]   We're finally going to do it.
[00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:34.020]   No.
[00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:35.020]   No.
[00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:36.020]   Well, I mean, it's lovable.
[00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:37.020]   It's lovable.
[00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:38.020]   Yeah, you have to give him credit, right?
[00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:43.180]   To wear your heart on your sleeve like that in such a high, high, high yellow shirt.
[00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:45.180]   Yeah, so very, very loud yellow shirt.
[00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:46.180]   So young.
[00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:49.380]   In such a position that he's been in for so long, you have to give him credit for the
[00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:50.380]   fact that...
[00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:54.340]   Like, do you think there's a part of him that knows and understands why that might come
[00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:56.820]   off as kind of cheesy and kind of straight doesn't care?
[00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:57.820]   I think he doesn't care.
[00:42:57.820 --> 00:42:58.820]   He doesn't care.
[00:42:58.820 --> 00:43:03.620]   He cares enough about Microsoft to say this matches my sentiment and my feelings right now.
[00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:10.540]   And see himself as just a big, loud, emotional, cheese ball of a dude which is completely lovable.
[00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:14.300]   He doesn't always leave to the best business decisions when it comes to advertising.
[00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:15.740]   He can't go away, right?
[00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:16.740]   He's got to stay.
[00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:17.740]   He's got to be somewhere.
[00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:19.740]   He has to be in our lives.
[00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:20.740]   Xbox talking.
[00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:21.740]   Still, Xbox talking.
[00:43:21.740 --> 00:43:22.740]   I'm sitting...
[00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:23.740]   Yes.
[00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:25.740]   And it all starts right there in that arena.
[00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:27.660]   I've looked at it for original content.
[00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:28.660]   Yeah.
[00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:29.660]   Yeah.
[00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:33.980]   And all this Microsofties come in and they're all just in that in the round stadium and
[00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:36.060]   he's like, "All right!
[00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:38.820]   Today's guest is Lana Del Rey."
[00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:40.820]   It's Julie Larson Green.
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:42.380]   It wouldn't be Lana Del Rey.
[00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:44.100]   It would be someone way more earnest than that.
[00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:45.100]   Jennifer Garner.
[00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:46.260]   We also should not.
[00:43:46.260 --> 00:43:50.500]   I think that whole thing was lovable and wonderful and we should not start to labor under some
[00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:53.100]   kind of assumption that Steve Bombers like a nice teddy bear ever made.
[00:43:53.100 --> 00:43:54.100]   No, no.
[00:43:54.100 --> 00:43:55.100]   No, no.
[00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:56.100]   No, this is not yet.
[00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:57.580]   Let's not fall into the Nixon with a statesman.
[00:43:57.580 --> 00:44:00.900]   Yeah, like he's going to start to get this resurgence of affection and everyone's going
[00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:05.500]   to kind of be like, "Oh, because earnestness is making a comeback which I'm excited about."
[00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:06.500]   And also he's gone.
[00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:09.500]   And also he's gone.
[00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:12.100]   And what does this video say?
[00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:15.420]   It's kind of leaked or because it's professionally produced.
[00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:18.380]   Yeah, no, I think this is from Michael's down the hallway and such.
[00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:20.900]   I like that sort of walk down the hallway.
[00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:25.060]   No, this is Microsoft's annual meeting and so I'm guessing this is for the worldwide Microsoft
[00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:27.300]   audience who couldn't be at the meeting.
[00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:31.660]   They create this feed and somebody pirated the feed and leaked it out.
[00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:36.460]   This seems like somebody from Microsoft emailed it to whoever first posted it.
[00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:37.460]   You're so jaded.
[00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:38.460]   You're so jaded just.
[00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:39.700]   I mean, it was a great moment.
[00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:40.700]   They should get it out there.
[00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:41.700]   It makes sense.
[00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:42.700]   It was very.
[00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:47.100]   Yeah, Steve Bomber, which my only favorite part about it is in the end he goes into the
[00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:52.380]   bowels of whatever the arena that they are in and he's so bomber excited and he's like,
[00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:53.380]   "Hi, five everybody."
[00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:55.140]   I just want to know like what he did next.
[00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:58.580]   Did he like check his email, like really excited, like Windows Phone?
[00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:00.340]   Yeah, do a full backflip.
[00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:01.340]   Check the hashtag.
[00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:02.340]   I don't know.
[00:45:02.340 --> 00:45:03.340]   He's just probably listlessly.
[00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:04.340]   I will miss him.
[00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:06.940]   I will miss him and then let's not understand.
[00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:12.060]   I'm with you, Molly, that let's not read into exactly what, you know, there he is.
[00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:15.820]   He's running into the bowels of the arena there.
[00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:17.820]   He broke that guy's arm right there.
[00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:18.820]   Oh, my God.
[00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:19.820]   He broke that guy.
[00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:21.060]   In appropriately hard handshake or that guy.
[00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:23.100]   I think we can all agree there.
[00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:24.340]   This is not an easy time for that man.
[00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:29.940]   It's fascinating because I just think that this level of emotion is so telling and it
[00:45:29.940 --> 00:45:32.740]   speaks so much to all the things that Microsoft has done, right?
[00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:37.140]   The inability to let go, it's like you forget that there's a dude and that dude at some
[00:45:37.140 --> 00:45:40.460]   point is driving a lot of this strategy and he has an inability to let go.
[00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:42.460]   He gets over emotionally attached to things.
[00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:46.220]   He becomes convinced, furiously, angrily convinced that this will work.
[00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:48.220]   That dirty dancing is the best thing is the best.
[00:45:48.220 --> 00:45:49.220]   Yes, right.
[00:45:49.220 --> 00:45:50.220]   You damn it.
[00:45:50.220 --> 00:45:53.100]   You idiots just do your jobs that this will work.
[00:45:53.100 --> 00:46:00.180]   It is telling that in great man theory, every personality is what shapes a company and you
[00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:03.100]   can really kind of walk back the cat a little bit.
[00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:06.980]   I don't know if we can read that much into this great man theory of history.
[00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:07.980]   Oh, please.
[00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:12.260]   Like we can allow we can allow Steve Jobs's name to be invoked for every single decision
[00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:15.860]   that Apple no matter how small, but like Steve bomber doesn't have that kind of control.
[00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:16.860]   No, I'm a bomber.
[00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:18.140]   I get him at Redmond.
[00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:23.380]   You are not allowed to make eye contact with him at all when he is coming down the hall.
[00:46:23.380 --> 00:46:24.540]   Nobody speaks.
[00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:28.340]   Only essentials are allowed to even be in the hallway as he's coming down the hall.
[00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:35.140]   And then he can tell the police like the control that he has at Microsoft is absolute was absolute.
[00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:36.140]   Oh, yeah.
[00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:37.140]   Well done.
[00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:42.620]   He had just say I think you can read close to his songs.
[00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:45.100]   I'm currently having the time of my life.
[00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:46.100]   No, he's not.
[00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:47.100]   Definitely is not.
[00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:49.860]   At some point in my life, I had the time of my life.
[00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:54.700]   Let's say it's interesting that we're talking about male emotions after that Facebook conversation
[00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:59.340]   that we had about allowing men to have their emotions now and now we're dissecting this
[00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:00.340]   people.
[00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:01.340]   That's an issue.
[00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:02.340]   I don't know what that means.
[00:47:02.340 --> 00:47:04.620]   I think actually not even a joke.
[00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:09.180]   My Molly posted something on Facebook about how public education doesn't allow men to have
[00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:10.180]   their emotions.
[00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:11.180]   That is not good for police.
[00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:14.140]   We have this small talk on Facebook about it.
[00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:17.860]   Now this has become something like we actually have to talk about it because this is how
[00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:20.820]   to have a man has a public emotion.
[00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:22.460]   I feel uncomfortable with this conversation.
[00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:24.460]   So we're going to do an advertisement.
[00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:27.660]   You want to or play your, you know, ballad?
[00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:33.500]   No, I'm going to do a very emotional advertisement because I love micro.
[00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:34.500]   No, I love Audible.
[00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:35.500]   Actually, I do love Audible.
[00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:38.820]   This week in tech brought to you by Audible.com.
[00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:39.820]   Everybody's leaving.
[00:47:39.820 --> 00:47:40.820]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:42.380]   Good time for a bathroom break.
[00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:47.180]   For those who need two audiobooks to give Audible a try, this listeners of this week
[00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:49.540]   in tech get the platinum program.
[00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:51.380]   That gives you two free audiobooks to try it at.
[00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:53.980]   Great deal for people who enjoy listening to audio programming.
[00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:54.980]   I do it a lot.
[00:47:54.980 --> 00:47:59.820]   I was actually talking to a friend of mine yesterday about how we both say, you know what?
[00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:00.820]   We do more chores.
[00:48:00.820 --> 00:48:03.900]   We take our dogs for more walks because we have audio to listen to.
[00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:05.140]   We have audio books.
[00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:10.540]   I've been listening to Peter F. Hamilton's Great North Road for most of my life now.
[00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:11.740]   It's only a one credit book.
[00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:14.180]   Man, that dude writes seriously.
[00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:15.340]   He writes for days.
[00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:16.500]   It's good.
[00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:18.060]   It's good.
[00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:20.820]   With other plans, you also get a free subscription to the Wall Street Journal or the New York
[00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:24.660]   Times daily audio programs and you get it with this too.
[00:48:24.660 --> 00:48:29.940]   For more details and to get two free audiobooks and their platinum offer, you're going to
[00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:30.940]   do this, Jason?
[00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:32.700]   No, I'm already a member.
[00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:33.700]   I love Audible.
[00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:34.700]   Pretend.
[00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:35.700]   Sign up for one of your daughters.
[00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:37.340]   Well, I actually have two credits waiting for me.
[00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:38.340]   Oh, it's kind of like I did.
[00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:40.460]   Do you know what you're going to buy with it?
[00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:44.500]   I tend to buy like rock bios and auto bios.
[00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:49.140]   Right now I'm reading or listening to In The Pleasure Groove, Love Death and Duran Duran
[00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:50.140]   by John Taylor.
[00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:51.140]   I don't know.
[00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:52.140]   I love that stuff.
[00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:53.620]   I love hearing the dirt on music.
[00:48:53.620 --> 00:48:54.620]   It's cool stuff.
[00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:55.620]   So hip.
[00:48:55.620 --> 00:48:56.620]   Am I?
[00:48:56.620 --> 00:48:57.620]   Yeah, you're so nice.
[00:48:57.620 --> 00:48:58.620]   I actually just went on a binge.
[00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:04.660]   I had like gathered like six credits and I just bought on a really light note the new
[00:49:04.660 --> 00:49:10.100]   Mr. Show with Bob and David Hollywood said no book, which is a full audio play reading
[00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:14.100]   of two unpublished scripts that they did with a lot of the cast from Mr. Show, which
[00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:15.100]   is great.
[00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:20.780]   They're a hilariously depressing level, Devil in the Grove, which is all about horrifying
[00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:27.540]   central Floridian, Jim Crow, violence and lawsuits with their good Marshall, which both
[00:49:27.540 --> 00:49:33.180]   are excellent and show you the diversity of the kind of content you can get on Audible.com.
[00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:34.180]   Well done.
[00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:35.180]   You can get both of them.
[00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:39.740]   Audible.com/Twit2 or two happy novels if you want.
[00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:46.180]   Audible.com/Twit and the number two for the free audio book of your choice, more than
[00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:48.740]   150,000 downloadable titles in there.
[00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:51.500]   You're bound to find more to that you want.
[00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:54.380]   You're going to get to this time, but then you get a credit every month and stack them
[00:49:54.380 --> 00:49:55.380]   up like Justin did.
[00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:56.980]   Hey, Tom, can I interrupt?
[00:49:56.980 --> 00:49:57.980]   Yeah, sure.
[00:49:57.980 --> 00:50:01.040]   Some people in the chat room were mentioning that they really didn't think that Justin
[00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:04.180]   should be in this panel, but I did have some evidence to show that Justin was--
[00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:05.180]   Yeah, so there we go.
[00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:07.180]   Yeah, I don't know what they're talking about.
[00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:08.180]   Wow, yeah.
[00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:09.180]   Yeah, there's Justin.
[00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:10.180]   Yeah, it is.
[00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:12.180]   I remember when you had that very pixelated haircut.
[00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:13.180]   It was right there.
[00:50:13.180 --> 00:50:14.180]   Right there.
[00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:17.060]   It was in favor.
[00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:18.060]   Back in the mid-aut.
[00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:19.060]   Sure.
[00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:21.300]   It was a whole line of pixelated--
[00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:22.300]   The pixel cuts.
[00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:23.300]   Yeah.
[00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:24.300]   Yeah.
[00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:25.300]   They call it an "aut cut."
[00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:27.740]   Not every little thought.
[00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:31.660]   It's time to take a look at the week ahead, Chad.
[00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:35.380]   So this is kind of awkward because I usually do a week ahead.
[00:50:35.380 --> 00:50:36.380]   Which should I--
[00:50:36.380 --> 00:50:37.380]   I have it here.
[00:50:37.380 --> 00:50:38.380]   I have it here.
[00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:39.380]   I have it here.
[00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:40.380]   Right.
[00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:41.380]   Yeah, so you just got it.
[00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:42.380]   Okay, sounds great.
[00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:43.380]   You're a dog.
[00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:44.380]   I'm going to have a cupcake now.
[00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:45.380]   Can I have a cupcake now?
[00:50:45.380 --> 00:50:46.380]   There we go.
[00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:47.380]   That's all a cupcake up.
[00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:48.380]   There we go.
[00:50:48.380 --> 00:50:49.380]   Okay.
[00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:50.380]   We all set.
[00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:51.380]   Yep.
[00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:52.380]   Yeah.
[00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:53.380]   Okay, thanks.
[00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:54.380]   Me.
[00:50:54.380 --> 00:51:01.380]   Here's a few of the stories we'll be keeping an eye on in the week ahead on Tech News today.
[00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:09.380]   It's a packed day, September 30th.
[00:51:09.380 --> 00:51:11.380]   Microsoft shuts down MSN TV.
[00:51:11.380 --> 00:51:14.380]   New faster Kindle paper white starts shipping.
[00:51:14.380 --> 00:51:17.380]   Zynga shutters the OMG Pop website.
[00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:20.380]   Free iCloud storage for mobile me users is over.
[00:51:20.380 --> 00:51:25.380]   And it's the last day to activate a Microsoft TechNet subscription.
[00:51:25.380 --> 00:51:26.380]   Tuesday, October 1st.
[00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:28.380]   4chan's birthday.
[00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:30.380]   The Note 3 arrives alongside the Galaxy Gear for $300.
[00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:35.380]   Galaxy Note 3 comes to Sprint and the Legend of Zelda, the Wind Waker HD comes to Europe.
[00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:36.380]   That's a look at the week ahead.
[00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:39.380]   Now I'm going to go back over there.
[00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:40.380]   Me.
[00:51:40.380 --> 00:51:49.380]   Oh man, you guys think the cupcakes are gone?
[00:51:49.380 --> 00:51:50.380]   No.
[00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:51.380]   No, Matt.
[00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:52.380]   Good.
[00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:53.380]   No embarrassing.
[00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:54.380]   Oh man.
[00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:55.380]   These are great cupcakes.
[00:51:55.380 --> 00:51:57.380]   Let us be with you guys in a minute.
[00:51:57.380 --> 00:52:00.380]   I was looking for the five seconds ahead when I was eating this cupcake.
[00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:01.380]   We have a little bit on my nose.
[00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:02.380]   Alright, ready, let's talk.
[00:52:02.380 --> 00:52:03.380]   Let's do it.
[00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:05.380]   Not eating cupcakes in solidarity by the show.
[00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:06.380]   Sorry, the show.
[00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:07.380]   Wait, does Natalie have a...
[00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:09.380]   Hey, get that out of my face.
[00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:10.380]   The last thing I...
[00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:12.380]   Well, we got lots of other stuff we can talk about.
[00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:16.380]   The last thing I want to make sure we get to is Valve with...
[00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:18.380]   It was the week of interesting announcements.
[00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:20.380]   Bezos said, "Come to me.
[00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:26.380]   I will have an audience with you and tell you about the ways of the Kindle HDX and the Mayday button."
[00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:35.380]   And Valve did like a kind of an augmented reality, alternate reality game on the internet where they had one announcement very
[00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:40.380]   inconveniently timed at the start of Tech News today, Monday, Wednesday and Friday, 10am Pacific.
[00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:41.380]   Oh, great.
[00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:42.380]   It was rude.
[00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:48.380]   But they announced the SteamOS, which is their own Linux-based operating system, meant to run Steam in your living room.
[00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:50.380]   They announced the Steam box.
[00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:54.380]   They will have kind of a ready player one-ish.
[00:52:54.380 --> 00:53:00.380]   You have to do a quest to get entered to get one of the 300 prototypes of the Steam box, and then you can test it out.
[00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:01.380]   I love that.
[00:53:01.380 --> 00:53:04.380]   And then in 2014, other manufacturers will be actually making them and selling them to the rest of us.
[00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:10.380]   They're going to be like, "Google, where you get the privilege of paying a really high price for a beta product?"
[00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:11.380]   You don't have to deal with class?
[00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:13.380]   Yeah, no, you don't have to pay a really high price.
[00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:14.380]   It's not like a simple thought.
[00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:16.380]   That'd be fun, if that didn't have to happen.
[00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:17.380]   Yeah.
[00:53:17.380 --> 00:53:20.380]   And then Friday, they announced a new controller.
[00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:21.380]   I'm curious why they...
[00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:24.380]   I guess they had to save it, because they had to announce the box where they could announce the controller.
[00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:28.380]   But it's touchpad in the middle.
[00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:32.380]   Touch screen, I mean in the middle, and then they have touchpads on the right and left.
[00:53:32.380 --> 00:53:42.380]   So they say, "This is the way you'll control your Steam box, and it feels like a regular controller, and it will also be open so you can hack it, and it should be usable with anything that you want."
[00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:44.380]   Because you can map the keys to go with anything you want.
[00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:47.380]   That's the other way they're saying that it's going to work on any Steam game.
[00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:49.380]   This goes, those keys are remappable.
[00:53:49.380 --> 00:54:00.380]   So if the Steam game, like Team Fortress, for instance, is keyboard controlled, you can match the keyboard controls to the controls on the controller, and control Team Fortress with the hand controller.
[00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:06.380]   So we're talking about like an OS that's an actual full-fledged OS, not just for gaming.
[00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:10.380]   Like you wouldn't necessarily... you wouldn't dual-boot it with Windows, you would actually use it, and it would support browsers.
[00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:11.380]   You can do it either way.
[00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:13.380]   It's a boot to under the hood.
[00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:14.380]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:17.380]   That should be wildly popular, one imagines, more so than the box.
[00:54:17.380 --> 00:54:18.380]   And it was, wasn't it?
[00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:19.380]   We're like, "One for email."
[00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:20.380]   That's a good question.
[00:54:20.380 --> 00:54:21.380]   I think a monocer...
[00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:22.380]   You try to get codes from your friends.
[00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:25.380]   It will be more wildly popular than the box.
[00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:34.380]   But I think that the box has the potential to be more wildly popular, generally speaking, but it's a bigger question whether it will.
[00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:35.380]   Right?
[00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:37.380]   Because that's what Valve wants, is everybody to go, "I'm not buying an Xbox.
[00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:38.380]   I'm buying a Steam box."
[00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:41.380]   Because I already bought all these games on Steam, and now I'll be able to play them in my living room.
[00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:42.380]   And then my living room.
[00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:45.380]   Well, and I'm thinking of my brother and others like him.
[00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:52.380]   There's sort of this resurgence in people who are into PC gaming because consoles are too hard to keep up with, and they're expensive, and PC gaming is sort of cool again.
[00:54:52.380 --> 00:54:56.380]   And then they do a lot of their computing on tablets, for example, and smartphones.
[00:54:56.380 --> 00:55:01.380]   So they don't really need an actual desktop PC that does all the things that a PC does.
[00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:09.380]   So, for example, in this one example, who I grant is probably not emblematic of everyone, but my brother's like my go-to for gaming.
[00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:15.380]   For people who have abandoned consoles, but he got Windows 8 and just lost his mind with Rage over it.
[00:55:15.380 --> 00:55:21.380]   So this is a cheaper, better, more functional option that creates a PC that does only what you want it to do, which is play games.
[00:55:21.380 --> 00:55:23.380]   Well, yeah, I mean, that's pretty cool.
[00:55:23.380 --> 00:55:35.380]   Long have PC gamers or people following the gaming industry thought that this would be that now is the time, and there have been many now was the times, that PC gaming would kind of step to the forefront.
[00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:44.380]   And for PC gamers, the huge success of consoles have obviously been a frustrating element.
[00:55:44.380 --> 00:55:57.380]   You have to wonder that now, as Sony, as Microsoft, kind of zig into the, well, we're games, but also we're everything else that you want to do in your living room.
[00:55:57.380 --> 00:56:02.380]   We're also content. We're also Netflix. We're also all these other things.
[00:56:02.380 --> 00:56:06.380]   That the idea of, all right, we do none of that. Here's what we do.
[00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:10.380]   We put games in your living room and we will have AAA titles.
[00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:20.380]   Is this the moment? Is this now, of all the other, this is the moments, the real moment, when PC gaming comes to the living room?
[00:56:20.380 --> 00:56:29.380]   I kind of feel like it could be. I really do because I don't think that the, I think now every box in your living room does everything else.
[00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:38.380]   So Chromecast comes out, right? And I go, well, I have six devices that I can count that do what Chromecast does, some version of what Chromecast does.
[00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:46.380]   Like, I can currently get Netflix on six devices in my living room, one of which is the Xbox, which is the one I never watch Netflix on.
[00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:47.380]   Yeah.
[00:56:47.380 --> 00:56:51.380]   Because I have it like on a smart TV and it's really easy and I have it on Tivo, which couldn't be easier.
[00:56:51.380 --> 00:56:58.380]   And now I have a damn Chromecast too. Like, I don't think that there is as much of a need for consoles to do all of the living room stuff.
[00:56:58.380 --> 00:57:05.380]   As they thought there was a couple years ago. And so now the idea of a more dedicated box where games don't cost 60 bucks.
[00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:06.380]   Yeah.
[00:57:06.380 --> 00:57:18.380]   And the idea of it's almost kind of more and Valve has been very open about saying, "Hey, listen, the people who are going to disrupt the gaming industry are Apple."
[00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:27.380]   Like, it's Google. Are these people that already have a track record with a certain kind of gamer and already have their accounts?
[00:57:27.380 --> 00:57:33.380]   And now if they get to the living room in a big major way, then all of a sudden all this comes down.
[00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:38.380]   And Valve is rushing to be in their own way to bring what is special about Steam.
[00:57:38.380 --> 00:57:44.380]   A lot of which is very ease of delivery, being able to download stuff day in date.
[00:57:44.380 --> 00:57:50.380]   The Steam sales, which dominate my Twitter feed with all of my gamer friends whenever something is kind of super cheap.
[00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:54.380]   It's really created a community that I think can translate.
[00:57:54.380 --> 00:57:58.380]   Ken, translate. The question here is the big thing. How much are these going to cost?
[00:57:58.380 --> 00:58:05.380]   And are they going to be sufficient to run a game at run a AAA title as fast as you would on a console?
[00:58:05.380 --> 00:58:07.380]   What do these things cost?
[00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:13.380]   Well, the chat room did point out to the exclusive game deals that keep PC gamers from getting things.
[00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:16.380]   So back to the PC element of it. You're talking about the box.
[00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:17.380]   Yeah.
[00:58:17.380 --> 00:58:23.380]   Yeah. So back to the PC element of it. Somebody in the chat room made a good point, which is that there are exclusive deals that keep computer PC gamers from getting to the game.
[00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:26.380]   And PC gamers from getting games as quickly as consoles.
[00:58:26.380 --> 00:58:31.380]   I think the question will be, can I play all the games that I want, which is what you're pointing at.
[00:58:31.380 --> 00:58:36.380]   Sometimes that will be a problem because it's exclusive to Xbox or Sony. And that will exist for a while.
[00:58:36.380 --> 00:58:43.380]   But also some of it will be that one isn't available for SteamOS. It's only available for Windows and Mac because they haven't ported it to Linux yet.
[00:58:43.380 --> 00:58:46.380]   Now, what they're trying to do is say, "Hey, we have in-home streaming."
[00:58:46.380 --> 00:58:52.380]   So if you have your Windows or Mac game on in your house, you can stream it to the box in the living room.
[00:58:52.380 --> 00:59:00.380]   That's a good patch. But if that becomes how it's seen, a lot of people will go, "Oh, why not have to deal with that with my Xbox? I can just play my games."
[00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:05.380]   Natalie, I think you were muted earlier and I think you were trying to say something. Can we hear you now?
[00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:08.380]   Yes. And I think you can hear me.
[00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:09.380]   Yes, I can hear you.
[00:59:09.380 --> 00:59:10.380]   I can hear you.
[00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:11.380]   I don't know. I'm talking.
[00:59:11.380 --> 00:59:13.380]   And I don't remember.
[00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:14.380]   Okay.
[00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:15.380]   I'm sure you're right.
[00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:16.380]   Sorry about that.
[00:59:16.380 --> 00:59:19.380]   Oh, you know what? I just was wondering.
[00:59:19.380 --> 00:59:25.380]   This was something that emails were flying around with codes, right? That's how that was working for the invite.
[00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:29.380]   For the invite, you have to go into Steam and choose to do a quest.
[00:59:29.380 --> 00:59:31.380]   Let me get to the screen that has the participation.
[00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:38.380]   So you go to the Steam Universe Community group at SteamCommunity.com/groups/SteamUniverse.
[00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:40.380]   You agree to the terms and conditions.
[00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:42.380]   Make 10 Steam friends, if you haven't already.
[00:59:42.380 --> 00:59:47.380]   Most Steam users probably already have 10 Steam friends if they're excited enough to do this.
[00:59:47.380 --> 00:59:50.380]   Create a public Steam community profile.
[00:59:50.380 --> 00:59:53.380]   I'll check to the forced friends situation.
[00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:59.380]   You create a public Steam community profile and then you play a game using a gamepad in big picture mode.
[00:59:59.380 --> 01:00:04.380]   Big picture mode was something they rolled out that is kind of the precursor to SteamOS, giving you that living room feel.
[01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:05.380]   That's it.
[01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:08.380]   Once you've played the game, then you can complete those steps in any order.
[01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:13.380]   As long as you do it by October 25th, you're entered and 300 people will get the prototypes.
[01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:16.380]   Well, this lives your dies.
[01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:18.380]   That does seem like a lot of work.
[01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:19.380]   Yeah.
[01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:23.380]   I mean, for people who are regular Steam users, it's not crazy.
[01:00:23.380 --> 01:00:31.380]   But this lives or dies on whether or not they can attract these triple A titles in the same way that we're saying,
[01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:34.380]   well, now you have these exclusivity agreements.
[01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:36.380]   They want to change that paradigm.
[01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:42.380]   They want to say, hey, these are hopefully boxes that are cheaper than the PS3 and the Xbox,
[01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:45.380]   which I think is very, it's like a huge key for them.
[01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:52.380]   And then they can extend their footprint in a way that PC gaming is just not growing.
[01:00:52.380 --> 01:01:00.380]   As much as it might be more in Vogue, it's not going to be the era of people buying desktops so they can play games.
[01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:03.380]   I don't see as a booming industry.
[01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:06.380]   So if they can, I mean, this is a big play for Valve.
[01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:11.380]   I mean, this is a next 20 years play and a future of gaming kind of play.
[01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:22.380]   I would say if it is successful, we'll be looked upon as more of an important iteration than whatever these new generations of Xbox and Playstations will do.
[01:01:22.380 --> 01:01:23.380]   So your money's on the console.
[01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:25.380]   My money's on the OS.
[01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:28.380]   I think it all has to be there.
[01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:31.380]   You know, like you can't have one without the other.
[01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:32.380]   My money's on PC.
[01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:33.380]   Oh, yeah.
[01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:34.380]   Your money's.
[01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:35.380]   Oh, yeah.
[01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:44.380]   I mean, why would PC gaming have more of a rosy future now as people are buying less PCs?
[01:01:44.380 --> 01:01:45.380]   Fewer.
[01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:46.380]   Fewer.
[01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:47.380]   Thank you.
[01:01:47.380 --> 01:01:48.380]   I think you can see me.
[01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:49.380]   I wasn't going to do it.
[01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:50.380]   Welcome to Buzz Out Loud.
[01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:51.380]   Hey!
[01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:52.380]   Welcome back.
[01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:53.380]   Welcome back.
[01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:54.380]   I'll be back.
[01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:55.380]   Welcome back.
[01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:56.380]   Yeah.
[01:01:56.380 --> 01:02:02.380]   I don't think that most general users are going to want to install an OS on their own machine.
[01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:06.380]   But I think enough of them will that it could actually give them the boost they need.
[01:02:06.380 --> 01:02:16.380]   Like it could flesh out the numbers so that the game distributors go, "Well, if you're going to have some boxes out there in 2014, and hey, guess what?
[01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:20.380]   Some big time manufacturers are making the boxes and you got some people installing the operating system.
[01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:21.380]   Okay, maybe that puts it over the top.
[01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:23.380]   I don't think it's the deciding factor.
[01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:31.380]   And we don't know how they measure success either because Xbox measures success in millions of consoles, whereas this is a pretty
[01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:35.380]   nation company and the US is built.
[01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:39.380]   So, you know, they may not need millions.
[01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:40.380]   Steam measures success.
[01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:43.380]   This is an Amazon model versus an Apple model, right?
[01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:46.380]   Microsoft measures the success in the number of titles.
[01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:50.380]   Well, I guess it's not exactly the same analogy because Microsoft measures the success in titles sold as well.
[01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:52.380]   It's a little bit of a loss leader.
[01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:53.380]   This is all loss leader.
[01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:57.380]   Steam measures the success in how many people buy games through Steam.
[01:02:57.380 --> 01:02:58.380]   Yeah.
[01:02:58.380 --> 01:03:00.380]   That's why it's a free operating system.
[01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:10.380]   And the idea that they can get like that they want to not be the left behind element of games like Grand Theft Auto.
[01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:15.380]   Like they don't want to be the, and then they don't want to be the dollar theater for these games.
[01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:24.380]   They want to be among those platforms that get them up front and be able to be a viable place where people want to develop these kind of
[01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:31.380]   contents for and or just change where we are now that like, well, of course you're going to sell an exclusivity to one of the consoles.
[01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:38.380]   And Steam is often credited with taking the PC gaming market and taking it from death to a fourth competitor.
[01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:39.380]   Yeah.
[01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:41.380]   And I certainly think they're ahead of Nintendo right now.
[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:42.380]   I do.
[01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:43.380]   I do.
[01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:44.380]   But the operating system.
[01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:45.380]   I mean, did they have investors?
[01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:47.380]   Sorry, investors.
[01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:48.380]   Do we know?
[01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:50.380]   Did they have investors or was it privately?
[01:03:50.380 --> 01:03:51.380]   Yeah.
[01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:55.380]   It was it was invested because the operating system is a sunk cost now.
[01:03:55.380 --> 01:04:01.380]   So whether or not they make any money on the consoles will depend on whether or not they keep with that model.
[01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:06.380]   But again, I'm just going back to how they measure success since they've already built this operating system.
[01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:10.380]   And then in order to make back their investment, they may not have to sell that much.
[01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:14.380]   They just put out portal three and put it on the Linux platform first.
[01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:16.380]   That's how they that's how they do this.
[01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:17.380]   Yeah.
[01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:20.380]   They don't forget Valve makes their own games too.
[01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:23.380]   So they are they are like Microsoft and Sony in that respect as well.
[01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:28.380]   And they actually have all the same parts and a lot of the same strategy.
[01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:33.380]   And I just there so far seems to be a limit on how much processing power you can pack and I don't know.
[01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:42.380]   I just for some reason I am stuck on this idea that there still is the is a future for PC gaming and that the OS makes that a really promising future.
[01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:50.380]   That you could start selling gaming PCs that have more power than a tablet or even a console ever can.
[01:04:50.380 --> 01:04:55.380]   It's not about so you can have a true gaming PC. It's unbelievable. The power is ridiculous.
[01:04:55.380 --> 01:04:59.380]   The hardware that they sell in 2014 isn't just going to be consoles.
[01:04:59.380 --> 01:05:00.380]   Right.
[01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:01.380]   Is what you're saying.
[01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:06.380]   Exactly that that steam OS could help sell PCs that are dedicated to gaming that run this operating system.
[01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:09.380]   You're alien where is your dog house systems you're you know.
[01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:15.380]   Like could stay alive because of this in a way that consumers want because they don't necessarily want to have to have a Windows 8 desktop.
[01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:24.380]   But they want a completely bad ass gaming machine that allows for multiplayer gaming in a way that consoles maybe just don't have the power to do.
[01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:38.380]   But then I mean don't we just kind of see these are merging markets that I mean like they they want people having dedicated gaming systems and whether or not we think of them as a PC system and somebody interacts with it with a mouse and a keyboard.
[01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:42.380]   Or they have a controller a steam controller.
[01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:46.380]   If they're plugging it into a flat screen and playing it then that's what they want.
[01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:58.380]   They just want more people doing that and making that decision instead of just saying well of course I'm going to get this Xbox and playing off the idea that a lot of people look at these consoles and say I don't really need all this stuff.
[01:05:58.380 --> 01:05:59.380]   You know I've got it.
[01:05:59.380 --> 01:06:00.380]   I got an Apple TV.
[01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:01.380]   I've got a Chromecast.
[01:06:01.380 --> 01:06:02.380]   I've got all this other stuff.
[01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:15.380]   And now Microsoft is going to put themselves in a position I think that they're already heading there that they're just going to have to they are going to try to lure people by way of content that they're going to get into creating their content and buying exclusive content.
[01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:19.380]   You know going forward and that's why you're going to have to get into their ecosystem.
[01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:31.380]   And suddenly Steve mo s enables like just a way cooler hardware ecosystem because I'm on this whole kick about how I think hardware is back and hardware all of a sudden is kind of interesting again because it's not just software and services now you've got wearable development and smart home development
[01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:37.380]   and potentially now a huge awesome much more interesting potential for gaming hardware.
[01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:42.380]   And don't forget there's a little throwaway line in here about having video music and other things available in steam.
[01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:44.380]   Of course there we go.
[01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:46.380]   You know Netflix is going to be in steam.
[01:06:46.380 --> 01:06:48.380]   Netflix is all Netflix and Pandora.
[01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:49.380]   Boom.
[01:06:49.380 --> 01:06:51.380]   Netflix is angry birds for these kind of things.
[01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:53.380]   I think Netflix and Pandora were in this cupcake actually.
[01:06:53.380 --> 01:06:54.380]   They're everywhere.
[01:06:54.380 --> 01:06:55.380]   Yeah.
[01:06:55.380 --> 01:06:59.380]   And so all of a sudden now this becomes another element into like oh but I also want something to watch my video.
[01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:02.380]   You know watch my cord cutting video my hooly word stuff.
[01:07:02.380 --> 01:07:04.380]   If they get enough of that it could be another thing.
[01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:15.380]   Now if the steam box comes out for 99 bucks then suddenly all of these like the Android you know standalone gaming machines in some ways kind of don't stand a chance to a certain degree because yeah.
[01:07:15.380 --> 01:07:19.380]   Because at a 99 bucks we're having a whole different kind of holiday season.
[01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:20.380]   I will tell you what.
[01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:21.380]   Yeah.
[01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:24.380]   All right we've got we've got a new commenting system on YouTube.
[01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:26.380]   A good 99 dollar box.
[01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:28.380]   I mean like there could be a 99 dollar box.
[01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:29.380]   I'm not sure if I could take it as right.
[01:07:29.380 --> 01:07:30.380]   Yeah.
[01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:31.380]   I was trying to transition there.
[01:07:31.380 --> 01:07:32.380]   Sorry.
[01:07:32.380 --> 01:07:33.380]   You still always do this to me back.
[01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:34.380]   I know.
[01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:35.380]   I used to step on you.
[01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:36.380]   Always have done this thing.
[01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:37.380]   It's like going to talk.
[01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:39.380]   And I was like riding a bike Tom.
[01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:43.380]   Usually when you hear speaking of that's when we're going to be riding a bike all over your segway.
[01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:46.380]   Speaking of riding a bike on segway.
[01:07:46.380 --> 01:07:49.380]   We got we got YouTube's comments getting changed.
[01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:55.380]   We've got Twitter IP going and we have a carbonite ad to tell you about this episode brought to you by carbonite.
[01:07:55.380 --> 01:07:57.380]   You got a to do list today.
[01:07:57.380 --> 01:07:59.380]   But I'm well some of you probably do have this on there.
[01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:04.380]   But a lot of you don't have backing up your computer on there and you definitely should.
[01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:06.380]   Backing up your files is important.
[01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:13.380]   I just had a drive start to go south on me recently and I had no compunction in changing the drive because I was backed up.
[01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:14.380]   And you're not alone though.
[01:08:14.380 --> 01:08:16.380]   Most people don't back up their files.
[01:08:16.380 --> 01:08:19.380]   So you can suddenly be better than all of them.
[01:08:19.380 --> 01:08:22.380]   Carbonite backs up your computer files to the cloud automatically and continually.
[01:08:22.380 --> 01:08:29.380]   Whenever your computer is connected to the internet unlimited backup space for your PC or Mac is just $59.99 a year.

[01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:41.380]   They're stored safely off site after you have a computer disaster.
[01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:44.380]   Which I know nobody wants to think they will but it can happen.
[01:08:44.380 --> 01:08:46.380]   It's probably going to happen at some point.
[01:08:46.380 --> 01:08:47.380]   It's easy to restore your files.

[01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:23.380]   Jason, should we talk about YouTube comments or Twitter IPO first?
[01:09:23.380 --> 01:09:25.380]   YouTube comments.
[01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:26.380]   YouTube comments is pretty interesting.
[01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:27.380]   First!
[01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:28.380]   Agreed.
[01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:29.380]   Yeah.
[01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:30.380]   There we go.
[01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:31.380]   Now I'm showing a comment about poor posting about that.
[01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:32.380]   Right, people down.
[01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:35.380]   Sorry, do you have any other one who gets those?
[01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:37.380]   No, I'm pretty sure you're not.
[01:09:37.380 --> 01:09:38.380]   Sadly.
[01:09:38.380 --> 01:09:41.380]   Yeah, so YouTube comments have a reputation.
[01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:46.380]   If you didn't know somehow, if you weren't on the internet for being rather harsh.
[01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:55.380]   And Google is now integrating Google plus in as a way to allow for cross posting, allow for threaded replies.
[01:09:55.380 --> 01:09:56.380]   Thank goodness.
[01:09:56.380 --> 01:09:58.380]   Welcome to 2002.
[01:09:58.380 --> 01:10:04.380]   And also to hopefully help keep the comments under control a little better, make it easier.
[01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:15.380]   Because YouTube channels, and I mentioned this on tech news today, like EconSentry, that heavily moderate don't suffer from nearly the problems that unmoderated YouTube channels suffer from.
[01:10:15.380 --> 01:10:17.380]   YouTube channels are unmoderated.
[01:10:17.380 --> 01:10:21.380]   How will I know how many of the viewers are from Brazil now?
[01:10:21.380 --> 01:10:23.380]   You can go into your video manager.
[01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:24.380]   Oh, okay.
[01:10:24.380 --> 01:10:25.380]   That's good.
[01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:27.380]   Learn something new every day.
[01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:30.380]   I mean, the key here is not just those additional features.
[01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:36.380]   It's that Google plus commenters have that there's a registration system attached to it that it's reducing some of the anonymity.
[01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:40.380]   And maybe I guess they're hoping that some of the registered Google plus users will drown out.
[01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:42.380]   Well, and it's the ranking too.
[01:10:42.380 --> 01:10:43.380]   I didn't know that much.
[01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:44.380]   Yeah.
[01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:52.380]   Because the ranking says, okay, you can make your truly Brazilian dirty word comment, but it won't be chronological anymore.
[01:10:52.380 --> 01:10:57.380]   So it won't be first, but not necessarily be first or last in line.
[01:10:57.380 --> 01:11:04.380]   It will be whatever's getting the most replies, getting the most attention, getting thumbs up, thumbs up, thumbs up.
[01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:05.380]   Plus one.
[01:11:05.380 --> 01:11:06.380]   Plus one.
[01:11:06.380 --> 01:11:09.380]   Yeah, I'm sure that'll be it.
[01:11:09.380 --> 01:11:16.380]   We'll be at the top.
[01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:21.380]   So the quality posts will rise to the top and the truly post will supposedly.
[01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:23.380]   And that's incredibly important also.
[01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:27.380]   Like I know I've been from my experience with YouTube comments and the shows that we produce here and everything.
[01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:28.380]   It's like the sun.
[01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:32.380]   I can't help but look, even though I know that if I do, don't look at the sun.
[01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:33.380]   I know.
[01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:34.380]   Wait, what?
[01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:35.380]   Well, you know, wonder your boy.
[01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:36.380]   Okay.
[01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:43.380]   And between all of that noise and that, a lot of times just those horrible comments are really, is really about valuable information.
[01:11:43.380 --> 01:11:49.380]   So being able to kind of filter it out, sort it into the things that actually matter most to you, maybe the people that are within your circles.
[01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:50.380]   I think that's brilliant.
[01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:51.380]   Well, I mean, at the very...
[01:11:51.380 --> 01:11:57.380]   And also in YouTube, you can't post links to things that are actually relevant because there's so much spam.
[01:11:57.380 --> 01:12:02.380]   It's really annoying, especially because Crash Test Mom is a product-driven show.
[01:12:02.380 --> 01:12:06.380]   So we do reviews of strollers and car seats and all of that junk.
[01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:09.380]   So a lot of times someone will say, "Well, you know, what do you think of this one?"
[01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:12.380]   And I can't link them off to another video at all.
[01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:14.380]   I have to sort of say email me here.
[01:12:14.380 --> 01:12:15.380]   You know, it's really limiting.
[01:12:15.380 --> 01:12:21.380]   But in Google+, they have a lot of options for linking and posting videos directly and putting your own.
[01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:23.380]   It's much more robust.
[01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:27.380]   So I'm glad to see this because it does feel like 1999 on the web.
[01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:30.380]   And as far as you're like, "Oh, it sounds like censorship."
[01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:33.380]   Nothing is not going to go on there if you type it.
[01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:37.380]   Don't worry, people who are typing in rape comments into YouTube comments.
[01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:39.380]   You'll still be able to do it.
[01:12:39.380 --> 01:12:45.380]   And to those people, I would happily say, "I'm thrilled if you're censored."
[01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:46.380]   I'm totally fine.
[01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:51.380]   I have actually, like, as the long journey on the web has come along,
[01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:54.380]   over time I have fallen into the camp of like, "You know what? No.
[01:12:54.380 --> 01:12:58.380]   You don't get to act like you don't get to act like however you want in society.
[01:12:58.380 --> 01:13:02.380]   You don't get to go around punching people in the face or threatening to kill them
[01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:05.380]   or, you know, pulling out chunks of their hair or whatever, however you act online."
[01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:08.380]   And it is not acceptable behavior, period.
[01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:11.380]   I am totally pro filtering comments.
[01:13:11.380 --> 01:13:13.380]   And I'm totally pro not a lot of them.
[01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:14.380]   Hold on just a second.
[01:13:14.380 --> 01:13:15.380]   I want to throw in something here.
[01:13:15.380 --> 01:13:16.380]   What's all this is?
[01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:22.380]   Real quickly, there are types of speech in the United States that you can't do.
[01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:23.380]   Right?
[01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:24.380]   We have limits.
[01:13:24.380 --> 01:13:25.380]   Except on YouTube.
[01:13:25.380 --> 01:13:26.380]   On speech.
[01:13:26.380 --> 01:13:27.380]   And when you're on...
[01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:27.380]   Seriously.
[01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:28.380]   You're on YouTube.
[01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:29.380]   You're on YouTube.
[01:13:29.380 --> 01:13:32.380]   We'll get into a video of a crowded theater on YouTube.
[01:13:32.380 --> 01:13:34.380]   They have and they will again.
[01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:36.380]   On YouTube, Google gets to set the rules.
[01:13:36.380 --> 01:13:39.380]   So those rules, because it's their private site, can be more restrictive.
[01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:42.380]   They can decide what kinds of debates they want to have.
[01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:44.380]   So I just wanted to kind of set those parameters around.
[01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:47.380]   When you talk about censorship, you're talking about a much different thing.
[01:13:47.380 --> 01:13:51.380]   And there already is accepted censorship even under the First Amendment in the United States.
[01:13:51.380 --> 01:13:52.380]   Absolutely.
[01:13:52.380 --> 01:13:56.380]   Well, there are people on YouTube who consider any infringement on their right to be a douche
[01:13:56.380 --> 01:13:57.380]   to be some sort of...
[01:13:57.380 --> 01:13:59.380]   Right, they're always going to say that it's not a douche.
[01:13:59.380 --> 01:14:00.380]   Do not have the right to be a douche.
[01:14:00.380 --> 01:14:02.380]   But yeah, that's actually not a right.
[01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:04.380]   Well, you will not find that.
[01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:05.380]   Particularly.
[01:14:05.380 --> 01:14:06.380]   But this is...
[01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:09.380]   What this is, and I think it is a meaningful...
[01:14:09.380 --> 01:14:18.380]   As YouTube has become a bigger cultural element of our society, it is shifting from an idea
[01:14:18.380 --> 01:14:23.380]   where anybody who types the thing five seconds ago is the first thing that you see up there.
[01:14:23.380 --> 01:14:29.380]   And the very rudimentary idea of the most thumbed up thing is rotating as the top comment,
[01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:30.380]   right?
[01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:32.380]   Two, a...
[01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:38.380]   Okay, we understand that we don't need to prove virility on this site.
[01:14:38.380 --> 01:14:40.380]   That people are here and talking about things.
[01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:48.380]   We can now show the most enjoyed topic with the idea being that there will be more people
[01:14:48.380 --> 01:14:55.380]   that will want to communicate even if just on a plus one I like this stuff level that
[01:14:55.380 --> 01:15:01.380]   the conversation will lead more toward civility than graffiti.
[01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:05.900]   However, the other thing that I like about that, because I think the culture of YouTube
[01:15:05.900 --> 01:15:08.380]   at this point is not civility for the most part.
[01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:13.380]   So the other thing that I really like about this is the new tools for censoring these idiots.
[01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:14.380]   I like that.
[01:15:14.380 --> 01:15:16.380]   And a lot of them are very young, though.
[01:15:16.380 --> 01:15:18.380]   YouTube still skew so young.
[01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:23.380]   So I'm wondering if the younger population is going to really like being pushed through
[01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:27.380]   Google+, and I think that could possibly hurt them.
[01:15:27.380 --> 01:15:30.380]   Well, they don't have to be pushed through Google+, so they're not trying to necessarily
[01:15:30.380 --> 01:15:31.380]   force all...
[01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:32.380]   I mean, they are.
[01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:35.380]   They're encouraging users to go that route, but they're trying to give you more Google+
[01:15:35.380 --> 01:15:36.380]   tools as far as I understand it.
[01:15:36.380 --> 01:15:41.380]   What I like, though, is the ability that you have increased tools for managing comments.
[01:15:41.380 --> 01:15:45.380]   So increased decision-making, like Tom mentioned, about who you allow to comment when.
[01:15:45.380 --> 01:15:48.380]   You can create a list of approved users who can always comment.
[01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:50.380]   You can blacklist certain words.
[01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:51.380]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:53.380]   And they're now doing what I think is a very...
[01:15:53.380 --> 01:15:56.380]   is a really good thing that a lot of companies do.
[01:15:56.380 --> 01:15:57.380]   They sort of...
[01:15:57.380 --> 01:16:00.380]   they sandbag blocked users, so they make them...
[01:16:00.380 --> 01:16:01.380]   they don't let user...
[01:16:01.380 --> 01:16:04.380]   when they ban a user, they don't let them know they've been banned.
[01:16:04.380 --> 01:16:08.380]   Previously, they would say we banned this user, which would cause people to create new
[01:16:08.380 --> 01:16:10.380]   usernames and go around and proxy and all that stuff.
[01:16:10.380 --> 01:16:11.380]   Now they don't tell them.
[01:16:11.380 --> 01:16:13.380]   So people think that these comments are getting through.
[01:16:13.380 --> 01:16:18.380]   They don't know, but it prevents them from trying to game the system and create new usernames.
[01:16:18.380 --> 01:16:24.380]   So in addition to all the Google+ related stuff, I think the most welcome changes here
[01:16:24.380 --> 01:16:28.380]   are in actually managing comments as they appear on YouTube pages, because frankly, at
[01:16:28.380 --> 01:16:32.380]   this point, the idea of having a free-for-all of comments on YouTube, to me, just seems masochistic.
[01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:34.380]   And unless I'm reading this...
[01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:35.380]   And old.
[01:16:35.380 --> 01:16:36.380]   And old.
[01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:37.380]   Yeah.
[01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:38.380]   I think we've gotten past that on the internet.
[01:16:38.380 --> 01:16:43.380]   And now we do, like Molly says, expect people to behave online as they behave in the real world.
[01:16:43.380 --> 01:16:44.380]   At least closer.
[01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:45.380]   At least closer.
[01:16:45.380 --> 01:16:46.380]   I don't read that crap.
[01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:48.380]   Like, you know what?
[01:16:48.380 --> 01:16:51.380]   For all of you who think that you've scored points?
[01:16:51.380 --> 01:16:55.380]   Like, my favorite Twitter feed in the world is "Don't read the comments."
[01:16:55.380 --> 01:16:59.380]   I want to hold T-shirt, one of the stay calm memes, and it's going to say stay calm and don't
[01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:00.380]   read the comments.
[01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:02.380]   If you read the chat room, I really like the chat room.
[01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:03.380]   Yeah.
[01:17:03.380 --> 01:17:04.380]   But I mean, with this...
[01:17:04.380 --> 01:17:05.380]   Sorry, so here.
[01:17:05.380 --> 01:17:06.380]   Unless I'm just reading this.
[01:17:06.380 --> 01:17:07.380]   I mean, this is putting the...
[01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:11.180]   This kind of power in the hands of the personalities, right?
[01:17:11.180 --> 01:17:13.020]   Of the people who own the channels.
[01:17:13.020 --> 01:17:16.380]   Which is the way that YouTube needs to do it because people who are...
[01:17:16.380 --> 01:17:20.820]   I mean, the biggest growth in YouTube are people who are in love and really want to follow
[01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:22.660]   personalities.
[01:17:22.660 --> 01:17:27.700]   And for them to say, "Now it's different if Jenna Marbles says, 'Well, I'm doing these
[01:17:27.700 --> 01:17:32.820]   and now I'm no longer allowing these words,' because that is a different story than the
[01:17:32.820 --> 01:17:38.300]   faceless, nameless executives or Google saying, 'Well, now you're not allowed to say blank,
[01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:39.300]   blank, blank, blank.'
[01:17:39.300 --> 01:17:46.540]   I think it's a smart way to do it and it is a sign of evolution for not only this site
[01:17:46.540 --> 01:17:48.380]   YouTube, but also I agree with you guys.
[01:17:48.380 --> 01:17:51.900]   The internet in general, because YouTube is such a large part of internet culture.
[01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:52.900]   Right.
[01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:57.620]   And you wonder what kind of content that they might now include that was precluded before
[01:17:57.620 --> 01:17:59.740]   because people just had such thin skin.
[01:17:59.740 --> 01:18:05.340]   I mean, Molly and I have taken our share of shots over just being women on the internet
[01:18:05.340 --> 01:18:06.340]   and it hurts.
[01:18:06.340 --> 01:18:07.340]   Wait, wait, wait.
[01:18:07.340 --> 01:18:08.980]   And how much did we want to give off?
[01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:09.980]   Dinosaur skin.
[01:18:09.980 --> 01:18:10.980]   Dinosaur skin, people.
[01:18:10.980 --> 01:18:11.980]   Yeah.
[01:18:11.980 --> 01:18:12.980]   Just try me.
[01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:16.220]   You can say that, but you know, it still hurts.
[01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:17.220]   No, it's terrible.
[01:18:17.220 --> 01:18:18.220]   It is totally terrible.
[01:18:18.220 --> 01:18:19.220]   You don't get so much.
[01:18:19.220 --> 01:18:20.220]   You don't get so much.
[01:18:20.220 --> 01:18:23.460]   So how many people have started a YouTube show or kind of tested the waters just to hear
[01:18:23.460 --> 01:18:27.780]   people say like, 'Your boobs look saggy or whatever,' and then that hurts and they don't
[01:18:27.780 --> 01:18:28.780]   ever post again.
[01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:30.940]   So maybe this will open up the content a little.
[01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:35.220]   Well, and I do think too that part of this is very, it's about protecting personalities
[01:18:35.220 --> 01:18:36.220]   for sure.
[01:18:36.220 --> 01:18:40.060]   People don't want to necessarily participate in a platform where they are putting themselves
[01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:42.540]   open for attack every time that they appear there.
[01:18:42.540 --> 01:18:47.140]   That is discouraging to the talent and the shows that YouTube is trying to promote.
[01:18:47.140 --> 01:18:48.860]   It's also discouraging to advertisers.
[01:18:48.860 --> 01:18:56.020]   Like from a purely monetary perspective, no brand wants to be associated with a page
[01:18:56.020 --> 01:19:02.940]   that is filled with a kind of like vile, disgusting, immature, violent crap that appears in YouTube
[01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:03.940]   comments.
[01:19:03.940 --> 01:19:09.420]   So Google and YouTube are making a very smart play here to say, 'We're worth the higher
[01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:10.420]   CPMs.'
[01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:14.660]   Look at what popular science did turning off comments because they said, they cited a
[01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:20.700]   study saying when you had comments that were disputing the science without good science
[01:19:20.700 --> 01:19:23.620]   behind it, it lessened people's confidence in science.
[01:19:23.620 --> 01:19:26.540]   Now, there's some other people saying like, that's the wrong way to go about a popular
[01:19:26.540 --> 01:19:28.660]   science, what you should have done is heavy moderation, etcetera, etcetera.
[01:19:28.660 --> 01:19:30.660]   And there's probably valid reasons to that.
[01:19:30.660 --> 01:19:35.700]   But in absence of the resources to do all of the better things, shut down the comments
[01:19:35.700 --> 01:19:40.340]   versus leaving them up and having people not believe your content because of the commenters
[01:19:40.340 --> 01:19:42.260]   is the decision they made.
[01:19:42.260 --> 01:19:44.540]   I was in favor of that decision by PopSci.
[01:19:44.540 --> 01:19:49.140]   I really do because I think you could devote ridiculous amounts of staff that they don't
[01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:53.180]   have to trying to make sure that the comments are okay and that they don't distort the
[01:19:53.180 --> 01:19:54.460]   science in some way.
[01:19:54.460 --> 01:19:58.460]   Or you could say like, you know what, this is not up for debate, science.
[01:19:58.460 --> 01:19:59.460]   Yeah.
[01:19:59.460 --> 01:20:02.460]   Well, all right here, one, one devil's advocate thing.
[01:20:02.460 --> 01:20:11.140]   If let's say this makes people less likely to comment, and even if you are eliminating
[01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:17.180]   an element that needs to be gone, is that healthy for YouTube?
[01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:21.860]   Is the idea of interaction, which is such a cornerstone of that site, is tamping down
[01:20:21.860 --> 01:20:25.100]   on that lifeblood good for that site?
[01:20:25.100 --> 01:20:26.300]   But does anyone know the numbers?
[01:20:26.300 --> 01:20:31.260]   It's good for them because I know for blogs and news sites, it's really only like 10%
[01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:34.700]   of readers read any of the comments at all.
[01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:39.260]   So is it a higher percentage of YouTube viewers who actually go through and comment?
[01:20:39.260 --> 01:20:40.740]   Does anyone know those statistics?
[01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:41.740]   Because maybe you-
[01:20:41.740 --> 01:20:44.300]   I think 100% of show posts read the comments.
[01:20:44.300 --> 01:20:45.300]   Oh god, I know.
[01:20:45.300 --> 01:20:46.300]   But you don't know.
[01:20:46.300 --> 01:20:47.300]   I mean, do you-
[01:20:47.300 --> 01:20:49.060]   Especially the ones you say they don't.
[01:20:49.060 --> 01:20:51.060]   People, yes, of course we do.
[01:20:51.060 --> 01:20:52.060]   But do viewers-
[01:20:52.060 --> 01:20:53.060]   Yeah.
[01:20:53.060 --> 01:20:54.060]   People-
[01:20:54.060 --> 01:20:55.060]   I think you're bringing over really-
[01:20:55.060 --> 01:20:57.780]   Do viewers read the comment and do viewers then comment?
[01:20:57.780 --> 01:20:58.780]   I think you're bringing up-
[01:20:58.780 --> 01:20:59.780]   Like when's the proportion?
[01:20:59.780 --> 01:21:01.940]   I mean, that's probably easy to prove.
[01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:04.860]   You look at how many people have viewed a video versus how many people have commented.
[01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:06.420]   It's usually significantly viewer.
[01:21:06.420 --> 01:21:07.420]   Oh yeah.
[01:21:07.420 --> 01:21:08.420]   And I think the key-
[01:21:08.420 --> 01:21:09.420]   So who cares, right?
[01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:13.500]   The key question you're bringing up, Natalie, is if you have comments on, do you know why?
[01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:14.500]   Right?
[01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:16.620]   For the longest time on the web, it was like, "Oh, the internet can do comments.
[01:21:16.620 --> 01:21:17.620]   Let's turn them on."
[01:21:17.620 --> 01:21:18.620]   Exactly.
[01:21:18.620 --> 01:21:19.620]   And I'm guilty of that.
[01:21:19.620 --> 01:21:24.180]   At TechTV and ZDTV.com, and I did it at Subrillion.com before that, we've learned since then.
[01:21:24.180 --> 01:21:28.780]   And we're seeing in action the process of learning how to exist on the internet and
[01:21:28.780 --> 01:21:32.420]   saying, "Okay, maybe in these situations you need this kind of moderation, in these
[01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:36.020]   situations you need real names, in these situations you can have open comments."
[01:21:36.020 --> 01:21:39.740]   And different approaches will apply in different places.
[01:21:39.740 --> 01:21:44.220]   And you're asking the exactly right question, Natalie, is, "Is it worth it to have comments?
[01:21:44.220 --> 01:21:48.100]   And if so, in what way should you approach them to make your product better?"
[01:21:48.100 --> 01:21:52.380]   And there will be times when it's worth it, and YouTube, I'm sure, does not want comments
[01:21:52.380 --> 01:21:54.380]   to go away, but they do want to create...
[01:21:54.380 --> 01:21:57.060]   I mean, let's be honest, I think what they really do want to create is a better place
[01:21:57.060 --> 01:21:58.060]   for advertisers.
[01:21:58.060 --> 01:22:03.020]   And so at the end of the day, their determination will be, "Can we make more money from brands
[01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:04.820]   by having better comments on the site?"
[01:22:04.820 --> 01:22:06.900]   And the answer will be, yes.
[01:22:06.900 --> 01:22:10.940]   Because Google has already had their handful with selling advertisement on YouTube because
[01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:14.020]   they won't sell ads on channels, they sell ads on demos.
[01:22:14.020 --> 01:22:21.460]   And so the idea that they can do a site-wide change does a lot to make that idea a little
[01:22:21.460 --> 01:22:26.900]   bit more platable to advertisers because it's less of a cesspool if it's like, "Well,
[01:22:26.900 --> 01:22:31.140]   I really want to advertise on the My Drunk Kitchen channel," but that also ends me up
[01:22:31.140 --> 01:22:33.940]   on these other things that have these horrifying sites.
[01:22:33.940 --> 01:22:34.940]   Exactly.
[01:22:34.940 --> 01:22:39.020]   It just so happens that the demo is also the place where all the bad comments are.
[01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:40.020]   Yeah, possibly.
[01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:45.300]   Well, Twitter is going to IPO in the New York Stock Exchange estimates of $1.5 billion.
[01:22:45.300 --> 01:22:48.940]   That's interesting because not the NASDAQ, that's where the tech stocks usually go.
[01:22:48.940 --> 01:22:51.900]   And NASDAQ has had a little issues here and there.
[01:22:51.900 --> 01:22:55.380]   So just what we've promised, we've mentioned Twitter, so there we go.
[01:22:55.380 --> 01:22:58.020]   Any last thoughts before we wrap up here about that?
[01:22:58.020 --> 01:22:59.580]   Is that how we have to do that, food?
[01:22:59.580 --> 01:23:00.580]   Well, for sure, though.
[01:23:00.580 --> 01:23:01.580]   That seems to be...
[01:23:01.580 --> 01:23:03.780]   It says, "Source is close to the situation," has said.
[01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:05.020]   True, no, it's a good point.
[01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:07.380]   So, all the more reason I have to talk about it.
[01:23:07.380 --> 01:23:08.380]   Yeah.
[01:23:08.380 --> 01:23:09.380]   It's getting...
[01:23:09.380 --> 01:23:12.900]   It's getting wind and dined by both exchanges, if I were them.
[01:23:12.900 --> 01:23:13.900]   Let's go and be quiet.
[01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:15.100]   Well, you heard about it on Horsey Books, right?
[01:23:15.100 --> 01:23:16.100]   Yeah.
[01:23:16.100 --> 01:23:17.740]   They're just like Facebook, they're going to save the economy.
[01:23:17.740 --> 01:23:19.020]   Were you mad about Horsey Books?
[01:23:19.020 --> 01:23:22.300]   I thought it was a dude from the get.
[01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:23.300]   You always thought.
[01:23:23.300 --> 01:23:24.300]   Okay.
[01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:25.300]   Yeah.
[01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:26.300]   Nobody fools Justin Robert Young.
[01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:27.300]   No, many people fooled Justin Robert Young.
[01:23:27.300 --> 01:23:28.300]   How are you?
[01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:29.300]   How are you?
[01:23:29.300 --> 01:23:30.300]   How are you?
[01:23:30.300 --> 01:23:31.300]   Horsey Books.
[01:23:31.300 --> 01:23:32.300]   I don't know.
[01:23:32.300 --> 01:23:33.700]   It was funny when it was there and I don't know.
[01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:39.340]   Anything that clever, I just had a hard time believing that a spam bot could be that clever
[01:23:39.340 --> 01:23:40.340]   for that long.
[01:23:40.340 --> 01:23:43.620]   And I just kind of suspect that it was a person and it turned out to be a person.
[01:23:43.620 --> 01:23:44.780]   And I think it's great.
[01:23:44.780 --> 01:23:47.500]   It was really funny and hopefully it continues to be really funny.
[01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:48.500]   Here's kind of what I'm using.
[01:23:48.500 --> 01:23:49.500]   I hope it didn't go away.
[01:23:49.500 --> 01:23:52.860]   But there was an intercept on the street that would give a little trivia fact about today,
[01:23:52.860 --> 01:23:53.860]   September 29th.
[01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:59.540]   In September 29th, in 2008 following the bankruptcy announcement of Lehman Brothers,
[01:23:59.540 --> 01:24:04.300]   the Dow Jones had its largest drop ever, 777 points in one day.
[01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:06.300]   Just trivia note related to the Twitter thing.
[01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:10.060]   Today is in October.
[01:24:10.060 --> 01:24:11.380]   That was weird.
[01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:13.100]   The autumn is when the crashes happened.
[01:24:13.100 --> 01:24:15.740]   Black Monday in the 80s, Black Friday in 1929.
[01:24:15.740 --> 01:24:16.740]   Not that 2000.
[01:24:16.740 --> 01:24:17.740]   Hey, everybody.
[01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:24.420]   So am I oh, we know we'll all be broke tomorrow.
[01:24:24.420 --> 01:24:32.020]   By the way, I feel like we have made a very, it was a representative of the culture at
[01:24:32.020 --> 01:24:37.940]   large that we got this far and did not mention Blackberries like continued demise that even
[01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:41.540]   we in depth, even in depth, we've forgotten Blackberry.
[01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:42.620]   I have an idea for Blackberry.
[01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:44.660]   I think Blackberry can still make a comeback.
[01:24:44.660 --> 01:24:45.660]   How?
[01:24:45.660 --> 01:24:46.660]   I have a whole marketing plan for them.
[01:24:46.660 --> 01:24:47.660]   Call me.
[01:24:47.660 --> 01:24:52.860]   I think I really, it will probably all the appeal to women because we love an underdog.
[01:24:52.860 --> 01:24:57.180]   But remember how like the whole era of spring was organized over Blackberry message.
[01:24:57.180 --> 01:25:02.180]   And I just think that there's something I saw a guy on the New York subway last week and
[01:25:02.180 --> 01:25:05.300]   I was like, man, he's using a Blackberry and that's kind of awesome.
[01:25:05.300 --> 01:25:06.620]   And it just made me love it a little bit.
[01:25:06.620 --> 01:25:10.460]   And I think if they started to trade on some sort of like underground hipness, right, if
[01:25:10.460 --> 01:25:13.140]   they were like, look, iPhone's kind of played.
[01:25:13.140 --> 01:25:15.540]   Android getting played like because it's really just Samsung.
[01:25:15.540 --> 01:25:17.140]   Everybody needs a sidekick.
[01:25:17.140 --> 01:25:22.100]   And they kind of just tried to be a little like set Blackberry up as this cool underdog,
[01:25:22.100 --> 01:25:25.780]   the one you want to root for the Rudy of smartphones.
[01:25:25.780 --> 01:25:28.940]   And then they could have an ad with like a bunch of really hip people using Blackberry's
[01:25:28.940 --> 01:25:32.620]   and then at the end they could like high five apply like a business dude with their black
[01:25:32.620 --> 01:25:33.620]   now.
[01:25:33.620 --> 01:25:35.620]   Nobody's crying this at all.
[01:25:35.620 --> 01:25:39.700]   I just, I want to love Blackberry like I feel like they can be okay.
[01:25:39.700 --> 01:25:40.700]   I want them to be okay.
[01:25:40.700 --> 01:25:42.060]   I feel like sidekick tried it.
[01:25:42.060 --> 01:25:43.060]   It has a keyboard.
[01:25:43.060 --> 01:25:45.220]   Do you know how fast that thing is?
[01:25:45.220 --> 01:25:48.100]   You're a fast, you can type on a freaking keyboard.
[01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:49.100]   It is awesome.
[01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:53.140]   I feel like this has been the Blackberry meetings for 10 years.
[01:25:53.140 --> 01:25:54.140]   Right.
[01:25:54.140 --> 01:25:56.140]   Except that they made the C10.
[01:25:56.140 --> 01:25:58.140]   Oh, we're going to be cool.
[01:25:58.140 --> 01:25:59.140]   We're going to be typing so fast.
[01:25:59.140 --> 01:26:01.020]   Look at me typing right now.
[01:26:01.020 --> 01:26:02.420]   Nobody's buying a keyboard.
[01:26:02.420 --> 01:26:03.420]   Boss.
[01:26:03.420 --> 01:26:07.940]   There was an exposade this week though about how they brought the Z 10 to the board and
[01:26:07.940 --> 01:26:11.060]   on the board was like the Blackberry founder and he was just like Thorston.
[01:26:11.060 --> 01:26:12.660]   No, Thorston brought it.
[01:26:12.660 --> 01:26:13.660]   Lazaritas.
[01:26:13.660 --> 01:26:14.660]   Yes.
[01:26:14.660 --> 01:26:15.660]   And Lazaritas was on the board and he was like, what the hell is this?
[01:26:15.660 --> 01:26:17.100]   Why would you do a smartphone without a keyboard?
[01:26:17.100 --> 01:26:18.100]   Like the keyboards are different.
[01:26:18.100 --> 01:26:19.100]   We have a Blackberry.
[01:26:19.100 --> 01:26:20.340]   And everything else is not.
[01:26:20.340 --> 01:26:24.100]   And then they lost their way and then they tried to be still like business Betty or whatever.
[01:26:24.100 --> 01:26:25.500]   Oh, just be cool.
[01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:27.980]   Be like the not iPhone guys.
[01:26:27.980 --> 01:26:31.700]   Man, I'll tell you what, that was like it was overnight, right?
[01:26:31.700 --> 01:26:37.300]   Like Blackberry was this juggernaut and then the iPhone comes out and like it was like the
[01:26:37.300 --> 01:26:39.860]   next day like wow, you're in trouble.
[01:26:39.860 --> 01:26:40.860]   Yeah.
[01:26:40.860 --> 01:26:42.620]   I don't know where these feelings are coming from.
[01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:44.980]   It was like Commodore 64 all over again.
[01:26:44.980 --> 01:26:45.980]   I like the keyboard.
[01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:48.900]   Clayton and I, my husband Clayton and I were having this discussion about how.
[01:26:48.900 --> 01:26:49.900]   What does she get Android to?
[01:26:49.900 --> 01:26:54.940]   If you want to sort of be cool these days and this always connected universe then you
[01:26:54.940 --> 01:26:56.820]   sort of be not connected.
[01:26:56.820 --> 01:27:02.500]   Like you can't reach me 24/7 makes me even more cool than the person you can always reach.
[01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:06.740]   So Blackberry should just like, I mean, I know they had their outages so they kind of tried
[01:27:06.740 --> 01:27:07.740]   that.
[01:27:07.740 --> 01:27:08.740]   Not on purpose.
[01:27:08.740 --> 01:27:11.540]   That was the test case.
[01:27:11.540 --> 01:27:14.900]   You reached me when I friggin feel like it.
[01:27:14.900 --> 01:27:15.900]   And then they could, yeah.
[01:27:15.900 --> 01:27:20.060]   So they could go Android and they could go underground like just be underground cool and
[01:27:20.060 --> 01:27:23.060]   then they would only get apps like Tinder.
[01:27:23.060 --> 01:27:25.020]   So wait, where are you advertising?
[01:27:25.020 --> 01:27:27.020]   This is so underground cool.
[01:27:27.020 --> 01:27:28.700]   What is the demo you're reaching?
[01:27:28.700 --> 01:27:29.700]   You just don't know.
[01:27:29.700 --> 01:27:35.100]   It's like, no, it's also like it's the ad agency people who are all using Tinder right
[01:27:35.100 --> 01:27:39.140]   now and they're riding the New York City subways and they're like, they're all on their iPhones
[01:27:39.140 --> 01:27:41.420]   but the iPhone is like for your mom.
[01:27:41.420 --> 01:27:43.780]   Now that's what side they tried.
[01:27:43.780 --> 01:27:48.860]   They got like celebs that were hip to say everybody needs a side kick.
[01:27:48.860 --> 01:27:50.100]   That was like Microsoft.
[01:27:50.100 --> 01:27:51.100]   That didn't work.
[01:27:51.100 --> 01:27:52.540]   Well, no, before Microsoft don't.
[01:27:52.540 --> 01:27:53.700]   You cannot get celebs.
[01:27:53.700 --> 01:27:54.700]   celebs are not cool.
[01:27:54.700 --> 01:27:56.300]   It has to be cooler than that.
[01:27:56.300 --> 01:27:57.300]   Like it has to be legitimately.
[01:27:57.300 --> 01:27:58.300]   It DJs.
[01:27:58.300 --> 01:27:59.300]   And I really.
[01:27:59.300 --> 01:28:00.300]   Like it keeps you from starting in.
[01:28:00.300 --> 01:28:01.300]   I am not stinky.
[01:28:01.300 --> 01:28:03.860]   Not by your way, but you're wearing bumper jacks.
[01:28:03.860 --> 01:28:04.860]   Yeah.
[01:28:04.860 --> 01:28:08.900]   No, I mean, I think that there it look, I'm not saying that trying to find something actually
[01:28:08.900 --> 01:28:11.380]   cool is not an extremely daunting task.
[01:28:11.380 --> 01:28:13.100]   See all advertising ever.
[01:28:13.100 --> 01:28:15.780]   You just like go get some of those Apple people.
[01:28:15.780 --> 01:28:17.660]   Don't get celebrities.
[01:28:17.660 --> 01:28:18.740]   Because that isn't cool.
[01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:22.260]   But just do something legitimately like the hippest people, you know, all European.
[01:28:22.260 --> 01:28:23.260]   I don't know.
[01:28:23.260 --> 01:28:24.260]   I feel like there's a way.
[01:28:24.260 --> 01:28:26.660]   It's a short term memory thing with blackberry right now.
[01:28:26.660 --> 01:28:32.020]   They can't be seen as super cool because it's too like our short term memory is what we
[01:28:32.020 --> 01:28:33.260]   know now in the past.
[01:28:33.260 --> 01:28:35.460]   But see, they just need to wait a little while.
[01:28:35.460 --> 01:28:36.460]   Right.
[01:28:36.460 --> 01:28:41.140]   Things become the retro, retro phone is like remember the 2000s like wearing the horn
[01:28:41.140 --> 01:28:42.140]   and rim glasses.
[01:28:42.140 --> 01:28:44.180]   Blackberry is the future horn rim glasses.
[01:28:44.180 --> 01:28:45.180]   Yes.
[01:28:45.180 --> 01:28:46.180]   Ghost team punk.
[01:28:46.180 --> 01:28:48.180]   There you go.
[01:28:48.180 --> 01:28:53.100]   Now you're talking about your shoes burn exactly.
[01:28:53.100 --> 01:28:59.860]   Imagine an era when the touch screen was never invented and keyboard was powered by steam.
[01:28:59.860 --> 01:29:04.220]   But lean lean into how nobody has any damn time lean into the I think the opposite of
[01:29:04.220 --> 01:29:08.340]   not being connected, but lean into how every just everything is fast and you can be fastest
[01:29:08.340 --> 01:29:12.140]   fricking hell on a fricking keyboard man and then you can Tinder and you can snap through
[01:29:12.140 --> 01:29:16.300]   the people that you want to date and then they did typing up the things and I believe
[01:29:16.300 --> 01:29:17.500]   somebody go leave.
[01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:18.500]   Right.
[01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:21.380]   They're getting sold for they're getting sold for parts.
[01:29:21.380 --> 01:29:22.380]   Well, maybe we'll see.
[01:29:22.380 --> 01:29:23.380]   I'm getting one.
[01:29:23.380 --> 01:29:26.460]   Verifax financial has a then not to get into that, but Fairfax financial has a bit of control
[01:29:26.460 --> 01:29:27.460]   of the problem.
[01:29:27.460 --> 01:29:28.460]   You can't get one.
[01:29:28.460 --> 01:29:29.460]   They're not even sold to consumers anymore.
[01:29:29.460 --> 01:29:30.460]   I know.
[01:29:30.460 --> 01:29:31.460]   Get one online.
[01:29:31.460 --> 01:29:32.460]   See that's better than the cash.
[01:29:32.460 --> 01:29:33.460]   You're going on the black market.
[01:29:33.460 --> 01:29:34.460]   Look.
[01:29:34.460 --> 01:29:35.460]   Yeah.
[01:29:35.460 --> 01:29:36.460]   You have to go to a vintage store to find that.
[01:29:36.460 --> 01:29:37.460]   See.
[01:29:37.460 --> 01:29:40.140]   I can get you a blackberry Z 10 dog.
[01:29:40.140 --> 01:29:41.140]   No, no, no, no.

[01:30:06.060 --> 01:30:09.060]   Good job.
[01:30:09.060 --> 01:30:12.340]   That brings us to the end of a very fabulous this week in tech, if I may say so.
[01:30:12.340 --> 01:30:13.780]   I had a good time anyway.
[01:30:13.780 --> 01:30:14.780]   Justin Robert Young.
[01:30:14.780 --> 01:30:15.780]   Thank you.
[01:30:15.780 --> 01:30:18.220]   It's going to be back together with the old gang.
[01:30:18.220 --> 01:30:19.780]   This feels right.
[01:30:19.780 --> 01:30:20.780]   I know.
[01:30:20.780 --> 01:30:21.780]   It's so long.
[01:30:21.780 --> 01:30:23.580]   Nobody loves Buzz out loud like Justin Robert Young.
[01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:24.580]   Right.
[01:30:24.580 --> 01:30:25.580]   Nobody.
[01:30:25.580 --> 01:30:27.860]   He is the heart and soul of the show.
[01:30:27.860 --> 01:30:29.420]   So what are you doing these days?
[01:30:29.420 --> 01:30:36.020]   Well, I did NSFW show and an FSL tonight with some guy.
[01:30:36.020 --> 01:30:44.500]   And it's a sports show where fantasy and science fiction franchises play against each other
[01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:48.260]   in a sport of indeterminate rules and length.
[01:30:48.260 --> 01:30:52.300]   And yeah, no, so you can find me at Justin or Young on Twitter.
[01:30:52.300 --> 01:30:53.300]   And that's it.
[01:30:53.300 --> 01:30:55.100]   And look up my old episodes on Buzz out loud.
[01:30:55.100 --> 01:30:56.100]   Yeah.
[01:30:56.100 --> 01:30:57.100]   Play.
[01:30:57.100 --> 01:30:58.100]   Keep looking.
[01:30:58.100 --> 01:30:59.100]   Send us your favorites.
[01:30:59.100 --> 01:31:00.100]   Yeah.
[01:31:00.100 --> 01:31:01.100]   Jason Hall, thanks for walking over.
[01:31:01.100 --> 01:31:02.100]   Yeah.
[01:31:02.100 --> 01:31:03.340]   You know, it was kind of a treat.
[01:31:03.340 --> 01:31:04.700]   It was a treat for me too.
[01:31:04.700 --> 01:31:07.620]   I don't get many opportunities to be on Twitter and to be with you guys.
[01:31:07.620 --> 01:31:08.620]   So this was awesome.
[01:31:08.620 --> 01:31:09.620]   That was fantastic.
[01:31:09.620 --> 01:31:10.780]   And we didn't make you push any buttons.
[01:31:10.780 --> 01:31:11.780]   I know.
[01:31:11.780 --> 01:31:12.780]   Which is kind of weird.
[01:31:12.780 --> 01:31:13.780]   Like just nervously.
[01:31:13.780 --> 01:31:16.340]   I had like a bunch of my keyboard switching anyways.
[01:31:16.340 --> 01:31:17.740]   Like I need to do something here.
[01:31:17.740 --> 01:31:20.740]   He fell asleep a couple of times because he only had like the one thing.
[01:31:20.740 --> 01:31:21.740]   Exactly.
[01:31:21.740 --> 01:31:22.740]   I'm bored.
[01:31:22.740 --> 01:31:26.460]   All about Android to it that TV slash a that's right every Tuesday.
[01:31:26.460 --> 01:31:28.980]   We talk well about Android pretty much.
[01:31:28.980 --> 01:31:29.980]   Yeah.
[01:31:29.980 --> 01:31:33.860]   And then I produce of course tech news today and do all the switching on that and then
[01:31:33.860 --> 01:31:37.980]   on my own time spare time when I'm not being a dad and very busy dad at that.
[01:31:37.980 --> 01:31:38.980]   All right.
[01:31:38.980 --> 01:31:39.980]   Music.
[01:31:39.980 --> 01:31:41.700]   So you can find my music at a yellow gold music dot check it out.
[01:31:41.700 --> 01:31:42.700]   It's good music actually.
[01:31:42.700 --> 01:31:47.500]   And then actually saw as many demands for Jason and my Twitter feed as I did for Veronica.
[01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:48.500]   I did.
[01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:50.140]   Can you believe that in your face?
[01:31:50.140 --> 01:31:56.580]   Belmont Jason is the blackberry of the.
[01:31:56.580 --> 01:31:57.580]   Not sure.
[01:31:57.580 --> 01:31:59.580]   I know what you mean.
[01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:00.580]   He's super hip.
[01:32:00.580 --> 01:32:02.580]   He's highly in demand.
[01:32:02.580 --> 01:32:03.580]   He's close to dad.
[01:32:03.580 --> 01:32:04.580]   See I'm not.
[01:32:04.580 --> 01:32:05.580]   Hey now.
[01:32:05.580 --> 01:32:10.580]   I'm not still sold on this whole blackberry is hip thing.
[01:32:10.580 --> 01:32:11.580]   OK.
[01:32:11.580 --> 01:32:14.420]   Fairfax financial hasn't been on him.
[01:32:14.420 --> 01:32:16.420]   They want to sell off his children.
[01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:17.420]   He's Canadian.
[01:32:17.420 --> 01:32:19.420]   He's also not Canadian.
[01:32:19.420 --> 01:32:20.420]   Not Canadian.
[01:32:20.420 --> 01:32:21.420]   Natalie Morris.
[01:32:21.420 --> 01:32:22.820]   Thank you for joining us too and hanging out.
[01:32:22.820 --> 01:32:23.980]   Great to talk to you again.
[01:32:23.980 --> 01:32:24.980]   You're welcome.
[01:32:24.980 --> 01:32:26.460]   Thanks for the invitation.
[01:32:26.460 --> 01:32:28.740]   Let folks know about your show.
[01:32:28.740 --> 01:32:30.300]   You mentioned it a couple of times on the show.
[01:32:30.300 --> 01:32:31.300]   It's cool stuff.
[01:32:31.300 --> 01:32:32.300]   Oh, thanks.
[01:32:32.300 --> 01:32:35.940]   Yeah, so I have Crash Test Mom as a YouTube show and we review.
[01:32:35.940 --> 01:32:37.740]   It's like seeing it for baby stuff.
[01:32:37.740 --> 01:32:44.860]   So if you have a kid on the way, it's stroller reviews and car seats and all of that stuff.
[01:32:44.860 --> 01:32:49.140]   And then also here in the Morris house we are app developers as well.
[01:32:49.140 --> 01:32:50.460]   We have an app called Requick.
[01:32:50.460 --> 01:32:54.660]   So if you have an iPad or an iPhone now you can download Requick.
[01:32:54.660 --> 01:32:56.580]   Go to Requick app.net.
[01:32:56.580 --> 01:32:57.900]   I always forget the URL.
[01:32:57.900 --> 01:33:00.540]   Just search Requick in the app store.
[01:33:00.540 --> 01:33:01.540]   And it's a speed reading app.
[01:33:01.540 --> 01:33:05.420]   So you find long articles that you'd like to read on the web and it displays it to you
[01:33:05.420 --> 01:33:07.740]   one word at a time very quickly.
[01:33:07.740 --> 01:33:10.540]   And just for the next day we're having a little promotion actually.
[01:33:10.540 --> 01:33:11.940]   It's $2.99 in the app store.
[01:33:11.940 --> 01:33:13.420]   It's normally $4.99.
[01:33:13.420 --> 01:33:14.940]   So head on over and check it out.
[01:33:14.940 --> 01:33:15.940]   Requick app.
[01:33:15.940 --> 01:33:20.260]   And let us know what you think of it as well because we've worked really hard on this.
[01:33:20.260 --> 01:33:22.700]   It's because my husband and I both work in news.
[01:33:22.700 --> 01:33:26.940]   And so we just wanted to create something that allowed us to read long form articles
[01:33:26.940 --> 01:33:28.380]   quicker on our devices.
[01:33:28.380 --> 01:33:30.020]   So requickapp.com.
[01:33:30.020 --> 01:33:31.900]   Unfortunately there's no Android device yet.
[01:33:31.900 --> 01:33:32.900]   Sorry.
[01:33:32.900 --> 01:33:33.900]   We'll get to that.
[01:33:33.900 --> 01:33:34.900]   What about Blackberry?
[01:33:34.900 --> 01:33:35.900]   No, Bob.
[01:33:35.900 --> 01:33:36.900]   I think that.
[01:33:36.900 --> 01:33:37.900]   Oh yeah Natalie.
[01:33:37.900 --> 01:33:39.900]   Do you have your app in the black market yet?
[01:33:39.900 --> 01:33:42.660]   You have to scroll through when we're at a time.
[01:33:42.660 --> 01:33:43.660]   Look at the world.
[01:33:43.660 --> 01:33:44.660]   What was that?
[01:33:44.660 --> 01:33:45.660]   Yeah.
[01:33:45.660 --> 01:33:46.660]   That would be.
[01:33:46.660 --> 01:33:47.660]   Seriously.
[01:33:47.660 --> 01:33:48.660]   All right.
[01:33:48.660 --> 01:33:49.660]   I'm going to film this for my little documentary video.
[01:33:49.660 --> 01:33:51.660]   Molly Wood, thank you for joining us as well.
[01:33:51.660 --> 01:33:52.980]   It was my pleasure to be here.

[01:33:53.980 --> 01:33:55.740]   Now there's a 19 camera.
[01:33:55.740 --> 01:33:57.500]   Is that from an already staggering 18?
[01:33:57.500 --> 01:33:58.500]   Tell us how you feel.
[01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:01.060]   So where can folks find always on?
[01:34:01.060 --> 01:34:02.060]   What are you up to?
[01:34:02.060 --> 01:34:04.820]   Folks can find always on at cnet.com/alwayson.
[01:34:04.820 --> 01:34:06.460]   Season 5 will be wrapping up shortly.
[01:34:06.460 --> 01:34:12.500]   If you missed last week's episode, a giraffe named Brandon Belts stepped on a Samsung Galaxy
[01:34:12.500 --> 01:34:17.300]   S4 active after much coaxing and an elephant through it to the ground.
[01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:18.300]   It got snot all over it.
[01:34:18.300 --> 01:34:20.900]   I mean that's pretty much your standard day on always on.
[01:34:20.900 --> 01:34:21.900]   Pretty great day.
[01:34:21.900 --> 01:34:22.900]   Yeah.
[01:34:22.900 --> 01:34:23.900]   That's amazing.
[01:34:23.900 --> 01:34:24.900]   Discovery Kingdom.
[01:34:24.900 --> 01:34:25.900]   We had a good time.
[01:34:25.900 --> 01:34:26.900]   How could you not want to watch that?
[01:34:26.900 --> 01:34:31.740]   And then we got elephants not all over the S4 active, which did not survive the dolphins
[01:34:31.740 --> 01:34:33.820]   by the way, or the giraffe.
[01:34:33.820 --> 01:34:35.820]   Spoiler alert.
[01:34:35.820 --> 01:34:39.180]   Giraffes are startlingly heavy.
[01:34:39.180 --> 01:34:42.740]   Thank you all for watching and joining us as well.
[01:34:42.740 --> 01:34:44.780]   We really appreciate it.
[01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:46.060]   Leo will be back in two weeks.
[01:34:46.060 --> 01:34:51.380]   So Father Robert Baliser will be hosting Twit next week with a fabulous all-star cast
[01:34:51.380 --> 01:34:52.380]   as well.
[01:34:52.380 --> 01:34:56.140]   Thanks to Chad Johnson and everybody here at Twit for producing the show.

[01:35:16.220 --> 01:35:17.860]   Like isn't anybody going to open the boxes?
[01:35:17.860 --> 01:35:19.380]   Oh yeah, we didn't see them.
[01:35:19.380 --> 01:35:21.980]   I'm having the worst sugar crash of my life right now.
[01:35:21.980 --> 01:35:22.980]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:35:22.980 --> 01:35:24.780]   Like I have a headache right here in my eyeball.
[01:35:24.780 --> 01:35:25.780]   You can never even mention that.
[01:35:25.780 --> 01:35:30.300]   I don't need to know if you can track that high when you were going insane about the
[01:35:30.300 --> 01:35:31.300]   Blackberry.
[01:35:31.300 --> 01:35:32.300]   Yeah, oh yeah.

[01:35:36.300 --> 01:35:37.300]   Blackberry!
[01:35:37.300 --> 01:35:40.060]   I actually make it look like you're cool and everybody's like the coolest guy ever.
