[00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:01.920]   It's time for Twit this Week in Tech, the show where we cover the weeks. Tech news with the best
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.840]   pundits we could find lying around. This show, I think it's a, it seems like it's going to be a
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.440]   joke like a priest, a Scotsman and a financial reporter walked into a bar. Financial reporter
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.520]   being the editor in chief at Crunch News, Mr. Alex Crunch Base News.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.680]   Crunch Base News. Sorry, at the base. It's good to be back.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.120]   Just don't call it velcro. Alex Wilhelm. Good to have you.
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.840]   Yeah, it's a treat.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.680]   Now Mr. Alex Wilhelm.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.840]   Yes, I am now. You're a married man. I am a married man.
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.200]   Has that worked?
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:40.400]   Well, I mean, so when we got married, I wanted us to be announced as Dr. Elizabeth
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.520]   and Alex Wagner or something like that to flip the gender thing.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.480]   Yeah, yeah. She wouldn't let me do it.
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:45.440]   You should take her name.
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.720]   I offered to. She said no.
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.840]   Actually, your name came up the other day in a New York Times crossword puzzle.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.320]   The Wilhelm scream. Classic.
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:03:00.320]   Ian Thompson is also here. Great to have Ian. He is at the register.co.uk.uk.
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.000]   He's our course news editor there. Hello.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.120]   Indeed. Good to be here.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.240]   You're the Scotsman.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.600]   The titular Scotsman.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.960]   Yes, although to be honest, I sound about the sculptures of the Duke of Edinburgh, but yes,
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:10.160]   it's a certain screen.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.240]   What happened to your, why don't you sound Scottish?
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.040]   Well, I went to my dad mode of Sasanak and moved down south.
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.120]   So I was raised in New Jersey.
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.760]   You should be.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:18.400]   Sasanak.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.200]   An English person.
[00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.000]   Sasanak.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.880]   That's what they call them.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.360]   They're from the Sasanak land.
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.520]   And here, and here, ladies and gentlemen, is the priest.
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.320]   Mr. Father, the very right reverend.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.200]   Father Robert Balissaire, digital Jesuit,
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.560]   on loan from God.
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.080]   I'm glad that you cleared up the whole,
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.080]   the best that we could find lying around.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:39.840]   That's what I was doing.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.520]   I was lying around.
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.280]   Hey, Robert, you want to do a show?
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.760]   Great to have all three of you.
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.920]   Actually, you and Ian were both at DEF CON this last week.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:50.560]   Was that fun?
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.280]   Show us your badge.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.920]   You have the badge.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:52.080]   Yeah.
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.600]   So every year, this is a big deal.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.200]   The DEF CON badge is designed by hackers to do something clever.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.800]   Wow.
[00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.400]   Is it a piece of marble?
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.880]   Yeah.
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:01.600]   That's quartz.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.840]   Yeah.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.400]   Quartz.
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:03.600]   It's a piece of shape.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.600]   It is an electronic badge in the back.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:06.320]   It always is.
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.840]   It's a power by a six-core arm processor that actually has
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.040]   some significant wireless communications capabilities.
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.360]   And there's different colors for different folk, right?
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.400]   So this is press.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.120]   Which is green.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.000]   Press is green, reds with the goons,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.440]   dark transition.
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.600]   Goons would be from the law enforcement.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.840]   Yeah.
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:24.400]   FBI.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.720]   FBI.
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.680]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.120]   Goons are internal security.
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.240]   They run the show.
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.400]   Oh, they're the internal goons.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.880]   Yeah.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:31.520]   OK.
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.880]   Is there an FBI color?
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.320]   No.
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.400]   How did they stop doing stop the Fed?
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.120]   Oh, that was always part of the fun of it, right?
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.440]   Yeah.
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.080]   It's quite the Fed.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.440]   Well, the problem with that is I could always point to Chebert
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.640]   and say, well, he was a Fed.
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.160]   Are Fed's not allowed to defec--
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.960]   No, no, no, Feds are invited.
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:47.920]   Yeah, that's what I thought.
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:48.080]   Yeah.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.360]   But they have to be open about it.
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.520]   Right.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.640]   So you can't hide.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.880]   That's why media people are told
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.080]   register for a media badge.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.240]   Right.
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.880]   Because if you try to do media work with a regular human badge,
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:57.760]   they will kick you out.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.680]   Oh, did you have seen the video of them doing that?
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.320]   That's brilliant.
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.560]   I think it was an NBC reporter
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.400]   who tried to get in.
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.440]   She applied for a John ordinary person's badge.
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.440]   And they said, look, we know your press.
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.560]   And she said, no, no, I'm not fine.
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.920]   I'm just coming as an ordinary person.
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.920]   And then started going around people just like,
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.440]   so you can act websites.
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.680]   Say, would you be interested in doing it for money?
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.080]   And they--
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.760]   Did you say that closely to my purse?
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:20.240]   Yeah.
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.040]   It was literally that bad.
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.040]   During the keynote, they said, well,
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.200]   we used to spot the Fed, but now we're going to spot
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.800]   the undercover journalist and spot points him down on a big face
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.360]   on the screen.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.800]   And she just rushed out of there.
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.000]   So I'm like, oh my god.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.400]   So I'm out of my people with cameras going,
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.560]   don't like being on camera now.
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.920]   Do you?
[00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.240]   It is to be so mean.
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.280]   They said, come with us.
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.960]   We will register you as press.
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.720]   You will go back in with the correct credentials.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.080]   And she didn't want to do it.
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.440]   So what are the colors?
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.640]   So green, green, black, white, purple.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:47.840]   Who's white?
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:48.400]   Humans.
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.880]   Humans.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:49.600]   Those are the humans.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.080]   Yeah.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.000]   So if you're just like a normal attendee or--
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.080]   Yeah.
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.320]   So there's human badges, and there's inhuman badges.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.280]   Yeah.
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.560]   Why is there wiring in here?
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.240]   What could I do with this?
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.640]   Well, if you go to another person with any other
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.520]   badge and you tap the surfaces, the court surfaces,
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:06.960]   they will actually synchronize data back in the bags.
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.480]   Is that secure?
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.760]   Oh, no.
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.200]   But so what I was going to answer that.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.280]   So are you getting their contact information?
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:13.760]   No, no, no.
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.720]   So this was part of the game.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:15.040]   Yeah.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.040]   Basically, you've got to get everyone's badge.
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.680]   It's like the game on.
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.840]   And then it's like, yeah, you get sort of more and more code
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:20.880]   with everyone's badge.
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.200]   And then the winner is the person who gets everyone's thing
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.080]   and then unlocks a nice drag within the badge.
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.320]   Yeah.
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:27.840]   Honestly, Def Con--
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.160]   Is that more like an amusement park more and more?
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.160]   No, it is.
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.000]   It's summer campers.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   It's summer campers.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.320]   So what is its actual stated purpose,
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:36.240]   aside from being--
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.680]   Because I only hear stories like this from the event.
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.400]   It's a really good way to meet people.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.400]   Right.
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.040]   But there are presentations, right?
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.600]   Yeah.
[00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.360]   Oh, no, no, no.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.520]   I mean, there's presentations.
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.960]   There's like 50 different villages going from everything
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.560]   from aeronautical hacking to election hacking to--
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.160]   All of the kids, top five.
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:53.440]   Yeah.
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.480]   I mean, there's also even a kids camp, which unfortunately,
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:58.960]   I couldn't get into because you have to have a kid to go in there.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.160]   And people get really arcy if you're asked if you can borrow
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.560]   their 10-year-old for half an hour.
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.400]   But--
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.160]   So what are they doing?
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.160]   You're asking kids about if you asked that.
[00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:08.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:09.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:10.960]   That is not happening.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.960]   All right, this is going to be a long, long, long.
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.360]   I've got to enjoy this show.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.360]   Right.
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.560]   I'm going to see if I have a job tomorrow.
[00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.360]   I'll even think of that.
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.960]   What are the kids doing?
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.840]   Teaching them how to hack.
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.120]   And kids can take part in the catch of the flag competitions
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.840]   and the online gaming competitions.
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.360]   You haven't seen a look of joy on a seven-year-old's face
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.920]   and when they've just blown someone's head off
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:31.640]   in a multicolon.
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:38.200]   In a way, this shows you that the whole community is aged.
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.560]   They're married like Alex, and they're having kids.
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.840]   And so now you have to have kids camp.
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.560]   If you went to DEF CON this year, you
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:50.040]   saw everyone from the stereotypical old school hacker, who
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.120]   probably spoke something too much back in the day.
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.080]   And you had the kids who were learning it for the first time.
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.040]   And that's actually kind of awesome.
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.280]   There's a lot of people who are bemoaning the loss
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.840]   of the old DEF CON because the show now is huge.
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.000]   It is enormous.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.080]   30,000 people is huge.
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.280]   It didn't used to be like that.
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.000]   The first DEF CON I went to, you could fit all of us
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.200]   into a ballroom.
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:10.640]   Oh, wow.
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.240]   Now, not even close.
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.560]   But that's just growing up, right?
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.080]   The thing that we used to do, everyone does now.
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:17.520]   Yeah.
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.160]   It's like when I watch esports now,
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.320]   I get really kind of bitter about it.
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.240]   Say you still have to work really hard to go find like Korean
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.400]   language vods on YouTube and my parents office.
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.120]   And now everyone's like, well, we've got Twitch or Mixer
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:26.600]   or whatever.
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:27.760]   I'm like, I need to work for this.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:28.520]   Yeah, those days.
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:29.840]   But fundamentally, I'm happy that it's
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.080]   more accessible and bigger.
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.240]   And it's more inclusive.
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.840]   I do miss land parties, but I don't miss actually setting them up.
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:35.760]   Land parties are great.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.880]   But don't you have land parties today?
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.000]   I haven't heard of one of these.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.840]   Isn't that what esports kind of is?
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:41.600]   Esports, yeah.
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.480]   But most people play on online ladders
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.240]   and kind of cool.
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:44.720]   Yeah, I guess you're right.
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.760]   It's not quite as community-based as it used to be.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.760]   A land party was different because you're
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.560]   all in the same room, a giant room press.
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:51.640]   And you can be a big beige box.
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:52.960]   And you're a fella people.
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.160]   Yeah, yeah, it was really fun.
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:55.840]   DevCon has a version of that.
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.440]   It's a hacker capture the flag.
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:03.640]   So they use teams playing team Fortress 2, which is a classic.
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:04.160]   It's a classic.
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.880]   And you can mod it any way you want it.
[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.600]   But that's only half the points.
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.760]   The other half of the points comes from those same players
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.160]   hacking the other team.
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.960]   So you can deny them various services.
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.120]   It actually sounds really, really fun.
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.520]   And that's like, OK, I enjoy that.
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:17.960]   That's actually how it works in the real world.
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:20.320]   Someone can't play the game, so they decide to hack their opponent.
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.560]   It's not a summer camp for hackers.
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:22.880]   It's really wonk of our hackers.
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:24.040]   I mean, this sounds like glass.
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:25.760]   If I even had a code, which I don't.
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:29.640]   But I mean, you really can find a little something
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.280]   for every definition of hacker.
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.600]   It's not just software hackers.
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.000]   It's not just hardware hackers.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.760]   It's not just social engineers.
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.440]   Think of anything that uses something in a way
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.960]   it wasn't designed to be used.
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:40.640]   That's going to be a demo.
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:41.920]   You met Funeranium.
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:42.440]   Funer--
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:43.400]   He's a coffee hacker.
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:44.000]   Oh, Phil.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.800]   And actually, yes, so Phil, I apologize to the panel.
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:50.480]   He gave me a carafe.
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.840]   I actually, Carson, got a picture of this beautiful black blood
[00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:54.360]   of the Earth.
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.800]   It was their Kona blend so smooth.
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.000]   And I was going to bring it here for the panel.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:00.200]   And I left it in the fridge.
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:00.680]   Oh, man.
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:01.680]   Oh, sorry.
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.520]   That's-- you tried it before Leo.
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.040]   Yeah, I bought-- he had a special--
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.920]   made a special refrigerated carafe.
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.120]   And I used to buy the stuff from him.
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:13.360]   And then I figured out how to make my own cold brewed coffee.
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.960]   Because he really is the king of cold brew.
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:15.720]   A quick king of cold brew.
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.240]   And he got me through Defgon.
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:19.120]   Because that was the caffeine I needed.
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:20.720]   You know what I do now when I travel?
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.720]   I did it in Orlando.
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:24.720]   And I've done it the last couple of times who traveled.
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:28.160]   As I-- stores now sell big bottles of cold brew.
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:30.400]   And I just buy a good-- because it's good.
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:34.520]   I bought a big bottle of that, a bottle of half--
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.680]   a heavy cream.
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.480]   And I get my morning coffee.
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.160]   It's actually a better way than having
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.920]   to run out to Starbucks.
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.240]   Alex, you've done the cold brew from Funeranium, right?
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.360]   Oh, I have a thing of black blood
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.720]   of the Earth in my office fridge.
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.880]   Because if you've known him for a long time,
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:53.640]   he makes sure that you don't fall asleep ever again.
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.320]   I love my Stein of Science.
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.920]   I think it's really-- where is my Stein of Science?
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.360]   Have you seen it around lately?
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:00.400]   Wonder what happened to that?
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.400]   I might be wrong.
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.520]   But Funeranium, though, is a net positive to the world.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:04.760]   Whenever I see him, I'm happier.
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:06.480]   That's just he brings energy and joy
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.960]   in different perspective on things.
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:10.160]   You know what he does for his full-time job, right?
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:10.880]   Lasers.
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.440]   Yeah, he walks over to people who
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.160]   bought a cool laser off the internet
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.160]   and takes it from them going, no.
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.160]   Stop.
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:17.660]   Yeah.
[00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:18.320]   Really?
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.360]   Yeah, he takes it away.
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.040]   Well, because he knows that most of the lasers out there
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:24.840]   have not been certified in any way--
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:25.560]   That they're dangerous.
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.960]   --to be used in the United States.
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:29.200]   Really?
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.760]   And his favorite part is when he has to do it
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.320]   to professors at Berkeley.
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.200]   Well, you should know that--
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:34.040]   --rafe.
[00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:35.360]   This is your job.
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.440]   But he loves safety and that sort of like technical
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.720]   specifications and that sort of thing.
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.600]   It's a perfect job for him.
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:41.720]   I didn't know it was a job that existed per se.
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.320]   But I now know that I benefit from it existing,
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.560]   because I don't get blinded by idiots
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.400]   with overpowered, unlicensed lasers.
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.760]   Here is a stein.
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:51.280]   Oh.
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:52.520]   One of the steins he makes.
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:53.400]   It's the promise of--
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.000]   They're very industrial.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.400]   Now, Ian, you said coffee makes you violently ill.
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.160]   Yes.
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:11:59.840]   Oh, that's sad.
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:00.400]   It's a pity.
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.400]   It smells delicious.
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.240]   You drink tea.
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:02.600]   That's good.
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:03.600]   It's your British.
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.640]   And I must say a big shout out to those people at Deaf,
[00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:09.360]   because I always forget one thing whenever I go to a show.
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.280]   And this time, it was my emergency tea bag.
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:13.560]   So day one--
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.400]   No, emergency tea bag means something completely
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.520]   different at Deaf time.
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:20.040]   In fact, most places outside the UK.
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.600]   You know, for a Catholic priest project.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:24.800]   So yeah, no, I just--
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.000]   I think we have a show tonight.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.080]   I was like, I'm going to send this around the company.
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:31.000]   I was on a show yesterday.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.400]   No, I tweeted out that I basically--
[00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:37.360]   because day one of besides, I was down to drinking ill gray,
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:39.560]   like some kind of savage.
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:40.400]   What is peace sites?
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.080]   It's another hacker.
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.440]   Peace sites is a hacker conference before Black Hat.
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.480]   I thought DeafCon.
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.560]   Oh, OK, so Black Hat's before DeafCon
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.000]   and B-Sides before Black Hat.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.080]   And do some people stay for all three sessions?
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:51.440]   I did.
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.520]   Yeah, I basically got home and immediately fell into the bed.
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:56.520]   So it is a news show.
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.960]   So let's talk about the news that came out of Black Hat.
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.760]   OK, well, the number one story from DeafCon--
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.800]   and I'm not sure if Carson can find pictures of this--
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:08.600]   is that there was an official village for hacker furries.
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.720]   I don't think we're not even joking about that either.
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.720]   Don't do the picture thing.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:13.800]   It's back.
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.880]   What did they do in the village?
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.480]   Just like it sounds, they were actually
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:18.840]   wearing their furry costumes.
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:19.840]   And I just hung out.
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.280]   Did you see a lot of furries, though?
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.280]   Yeah, right.
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:23.200]   I thought it was fun.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.360]   I don't know what a furries, and I don't want to know.
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:27.560]   Thank you.
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:31.000]   US military, is it related to neckbeards?
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:31.360]   No.
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.440]   No, no, no.
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:35.880]   It's people who like dressing up as their favorite animal.
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.320]   Well, there's nothing wrong with that.
[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:40.360]   It occasionally I like to dress up as Bambi.
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.360]   OK.
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:42.120]   What about that, Lebron?
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.200]   It takes all salts to make the world.
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:48.440]   The US military was at Defcon, according to Juan Ian Thompson.
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.320]   Yeah, they had an aviation village for the--
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.600]   aviation hacking village for the first time.
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.080]   They wanted people to hack planes?
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.200]   Yeah.
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:59.240]   Planes, air bases, flight control systems on helicopters.
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.080]   They had the F-15.
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.320]   They had a team of hackers going through the F-15s flight
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.080]   control systems.
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:04.560]   Wow.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:05.920]   Trying to find bugs there.
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.960]   It's the theory that--
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:12.400]   you hear this a lot, where like bug bounties and hackathons,
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.720]   what is the goal of something like this?
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.080]   What does the military learn from this?
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:19.000]   Well, basically I was chatting to one of their people,
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.440]   and he was saying that they've always
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:24.800]   had people looking at the hardware issues for the last 40 years.
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.840]   But it's only in the last five or six years
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:29.960]   that they've actually had teams of military hackers
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.320]   trying to hack their own system.
[00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:32.760]   They're doing what we call pen testing.
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.480]   Yeah, penetration testing.
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:38.160]   But the thinking was-- and this was pioneered by Katie Missouri
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:40.680]   so you can convince them to give it a shot.
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:41.640]   She's great.
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:42.360]   I love her.
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:42.960]   Genius.
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:45.320]   And they wanted to get outside eyes
[00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:48.080]   because if you're in the Air Force,
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:49.280]   you know the control software.
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.920]   You get into a certain mentality that you know the software.
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:55.240]   Bringing in someone else who's never seen it before
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.000]   can enable you to find things that would have been missed.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.120]   And also, the best hacking talent probably
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.600]   isn't in the US military.
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.640]   So they were opening it up.
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:06.880]   So it wasn't recruitment.
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:07.720]   It's not much as--
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:10.760]   Well, I mean, I'm willing to bet somebody did really well
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:11.760]   and they'll be getting a call.
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.400]   You know if you do fancy a new career?
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:13.760]   Because--
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:20.120]   This was in the Aviation Village, a LEGO model of a US airbase.
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:24.520]   Yeah, no, you see, that was to test out a SCADA control system.
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.520]   So there's a SCADA control system in this--
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:27.040]   Yeah.
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:30.800]   The whole thing's run off that laptop by a guy
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:31.600]   with a SCADA control system.
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:34.560]   And so your goal as the hacker is to try to get into the system
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:38.000]   and make that plane crash or make the lights all go off.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.680]   And that industrial control is in 80% of the world's airports.
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:42.680]   Wow.
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.880]   Now, is there an agreement that if you do figure out
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:48.000]   how to do that, that you will tell them how you did it?
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.280]   I think-- well, OK.
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:53.480]   If things like the F-15 hacking, then hackers
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:54.520]   had to be pre-screened.
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:55.840]   They had to be American citizens and they
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.440]   had to have a security clearance.
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:15:59.080]   They have to have a security clearance.
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.680]   Yeah, or at least a security check just to make sure they're not.
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:02.200]   Wow.
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:05.320]   Well, because if they're going to let you into the bus of the planes
[00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:06.840]   that's actually in the Americans defense--
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.400]   That could do a lot of reconnaissance there.
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:08.920]   Exactly.
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.080]   Yeah, that's not great.
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:12.080]   One of the things that you got from this village, though,
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:16.640]   was they are laser focused on protecting the actual systems
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:19.720]   that go into war fighting vehicles or into airports.
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.240]   But one of the easiest hacks is also
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:24.800]   a hack that's been around for the longest time, which is right
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:28.360]   down on the other side of the aisle, there was the RF
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:29.400]   village.
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.640]   And they were showing how you could
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:34.840]   choose a $40 radio to spoof a GPS signal.
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:35.340]   Wow.
[00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:37.620]   It doesn't matter how secure you've made your system.
[00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:40.460]   If it's relying on a system that can be easily hacked,
[00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:42.420]   they can misdirect your forces.
[00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:44.620]   And so the military, like you said,
[00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:47.420]   they were so laser focused on protecting the machinery,
[00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:49.100]   they realized, oh, wait a minute.
[00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:50.860]   What about all the other stuff we depend upon
[00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:52.940]   that we don't actually control?
[00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:54.200]   This is all a good thing.
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.200]   That's a great thing.
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.580]   We keep hearing about GPS spoofing due to Russia.
[00:16:57.580 --> 00:16:59.660]   So it just needs to be happy that someone's thinking about it.
[00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:03.900]   You could steer a ship into a shore or another ship
[00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:04.780]   if you were-- Exactly.
[00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:06.060]   You could do that right here.
[00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:08.180]   You could go to the top of the-- well, not the top--
[00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:10.300]   the observation deck of the Golden Gate Bridge
[00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:11.740]   with your SDR radio.
[00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:13.900]   You can find the beacons of all the ships that
[00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.700]   are in the bay, and then you can start sending them
[00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:16.420]   erroneous information.
[00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:17.380]   Holy cow.
[00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:17.980]   Don't do that.
[00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:18.580]   Go do that.
[00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:19.500]   Yeah.
[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:21.340]   Back, forget taking away lasers.
[00:17:21.340 --> 00:17:23.380]   Lasers, take away people's SDRs.
[00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:26.740]   We need a new fill.
[00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:28.380]   There was a voting machine village.
[00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:32.860]   Now, I remember in years past the horrific ease
[00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:34.020]   with which people couldn't--
[00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:34.860]   It really hasn't changed, though.
[00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:35.540]   It hasn't changed.
[00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:37.100]   I mean, it's the actual--
[00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:38.740]   I was speaking to one of the organizers,
[00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:40.340]   and he said, we've had one guy come in,
[00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:42.780]   sit down in front of a voting machine, 45 minutes later.
[00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:45.380]   He's figured out how to change the tally as remotely.
[00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:47.740]   Took 10 minutes for someone to run Nyan Cat.
[00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:48.620]   I'm not bonding with you.
[00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:49.620]   Yeah.
[00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:52.900]   That's an old fashion, particularly obnoxious.
[00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:55.580]   So imagine Republican Democrat in suddenly--
[00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:57.180]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:58.860]   That is one of the worst songs ever before.
[00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:00.220]   It is.
[00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:03.180]   Bruce Schneier, this is another Ian Thompson piece.
[00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:05.220]   Bruce was on form.
[00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:06.340]   He spoke at Black Hat.
[00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:08.740]   Yeah, he's basically-- I think Bruce has got to the point now.
[00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:10.740]   He's like, I've made one.
[00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:11.860]   I've got my reputation.
[00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:13.140]   I'm just going to say it like it is.
[00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:14.140]   Good.
[00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:15.940]   Let's say Bruce All-Ridey.
[00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.140]   The Bruce All-Ridey.
[00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:18.540]   Bruce All-Ridey.
[00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:19.540]   It's the register.
[00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:21.540]   It's the register right there.
[00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:22.340]   Bruce All-Ridey.
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:24.380]   We had fun with it.
[00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:27.500]   He says, paper ballots would solve all of these problems.
[00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:27.980]   It's not hard.
[00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:29.220]   It's not controversial.
[00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:30.100]   It's been done before.
[00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:31.300]   I mean, obviously--
[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:31.780]   Actually--
[00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:32.580]   I'm counting.
[00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:34.380]   You don't need to have a paper ballot.
[00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:35.620]   You need to have a paper trail.
[00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:36.220]   Correct.
[00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:36.620]   Yeah.
[00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:39.100]   Although, I mean, the system he's suggesting,
[00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:40.380]   which is the one they've got in Minnesota,
[00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:43.140]   is basically you punch out who you want to vote for.
[00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:44.620]   But isn't that what went wrong in Florida?
[00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:45.100]   I mean, I live in--
[00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:47.420]   hanging chats in the spotter flight building.
[00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:51.060]   I mean, it's surely not beyond the bounds of human possibility
[00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:52.700]   to have a paper machine that works.
[00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:54.740]   And then you just feed them into the reader
[00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:56.660]   and you've got that paper trail.
[00:18:56.660 --> 00:18:58.500]   Or you could have an electronic machine
[00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.140]   that prints out a receipt.
[00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:01.300]   I guess it's still hackable.
[00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:03.580]   Well, no, I mean, because the best voting machine I've seen
[00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:04.660]   is electronic voting.
[00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:06.940]   And it has a little window with a printer behind it.
[00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:08.420]   And when you're done with your vote, it actually--
[00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:09.300]   You look at the printout.
[00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:09.800]   Correct.
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:10.620]   It prints your name.
[00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:11.700]   It prints your information.
[00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:12.660]   It prints out all your votes.
[00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:13.780]   And you can check it.
[00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:15.980]   And if it's right, you say, OK, I'm done.
[00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:17.500]   Move on.
[00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:18.580]   And that's sealed away.
[00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:20.340]   So no one can touch that.
[00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:23.500]   But pure electronic voting with no receipt is just--
[00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:24.180]   That's a bad idea.
[00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:25.340]   It's asking to be hacked.
[00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:27.580]   It's yet it's being used by many states.
[00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:28.180]   And that's right.
[00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:29.660]   Well, let's not over-blow it.
[00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:32.540]   I mean, just because they found all those machines that were
[00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:35.260]   running an unpatched version of PC anywhere
[00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:36.740]   doesn't mean that that's--
[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:37.740]   Ah.
[00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:38.740]   Right?
[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:39.860]   It works like it happened.
[00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:41.060]   Literally everything.
[00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:41.980]   Yeah.
[00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:44.020]   I mean, Kim Zeta had broke a good story
[00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:45.420]   over the conference as well.
[00:19:45.420 --> 00:19:48.420]   Well, it was just basically the machines which
[00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:50.940]   tally the votes that get the digital vote.
[00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.340]   Had been left connected to the internet.
[00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:54.300]   They're supposed to be on there for 10 minutes on election
[00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:54.860]   night.
[00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:57.180]   And they've been left on there for over a year.
[00:19:57.180 --> 00:20:00.620]   And people are going to be looking around on that.
[00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:03.740]   And this is democracy we're talking about.
[00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:07.860]   One of the talks by a young Bill Gates--
[00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:09.860]   He just looked like he's 12.
[00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:10.780]   I mean, seriously.
[00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:12.740]   And the scary part is he still wears those pants?
[00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:13.380]   Yeah.
[00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:15.820]   This is James Paver.
[00:20:15.820 --> 00:20:19.660]   He talked about how GDPR is a hacker's delight.
[00:20:19.660 --> 00:20:20.220]   Yeah.
[00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:21.220]   It's a really good--
[00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:23.900]   He had the European data protection regulation.
[00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:24.980]   How is it a hacker's delight?
[00:20:24.980 --> 00:20:26.860]   Well, it was fascinating because he
[00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:31.220]   said he and his fiance were in a Polish airport being
[00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:33.060]   screwed around by the airport managers.
[00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:35.380]   So they thought, well, how can we get back of them?
[00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:37.380]   Let's send them a load of a bunch of GDPR requests
[00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:39.140]   to take up their time.
[00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:40.620]   And then he had an idea.
[00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:43.140]   I wonder what information you could get for it
[00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:45.580]   just by both pretending to be someone and saying,
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:47.660]   send me all the GDPR information--
[00:20:47.660 --> 00:20:49.940]   and GDPR, send me all the information you've got on me.
[00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:51.420]   So instead of a dummy email address--
[00:20:51.420 --> 00:20:53.180]   You should not be able to do that.
[00:20:53.180 --> 00:20:55.700]   Well, it turns out it's surprisingly easy.
[00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:57.580]   So his real concern was identity theft.
[00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:00.980]   If you'd propose as Ian Thompson make a GDPR request,
[00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:02.260]   you'd get everything.
[00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:03.180]   Yeah, basically.
[00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:06.940]   And the standard of evidence that they were asking for that,
[00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:09.100]   are you this person, was laughably poor.
[00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:10.580]   What do they want?
[00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:12.900]   In one case, they accepted an envelope that was addressed
[00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:14.940]   to them.
[00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:19.420]   They accepted an email just out of the blue.
[00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:20.900]   They don't really verify it.
[00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:24.180]   Because they're required by law to answer it within a month,
[00:21:24.180 --> 00:21:25.500]   which puts a lot of pressure on them
[00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:27.380]   to get the reply out.
[00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:29.700]   Otherwise, they're going to be financially liable for that.
[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:30.180]   Yeah.
[00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:34.180]   And educational software sent Paver, his fiance social security
[00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:37.460]   number, date of birth, her mother's maiden name.
[00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:40.540]   Another firm sent 10 digits of her credit card number.
[00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:41.140]   10?
[00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:42.060]   10.
[00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:44.020]   I think that's all, isn't it?
[00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:47.820]   The expiration date card type and her postal code.
[00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:48.660]   Yeah.
[00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:50.460]   Actually, also old email account--
[00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:51.020]   16.
[00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:52.620]   So you miss you need six more.
[00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:53.100]   OK.
[00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:54.700]   I've never unfreezed my credit.
[00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:56.100]   I'm just going to leave it for a while.
[00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:57.100]   I'm just going to leave it for a while.
[00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:58.700]   But it was just the amount of stuff
[00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:01.300]   that people were sending in was really quite scary.
[00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:01.980]   Interesting.
[00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:03.380]   As Padre says, it's because they're
[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:04.940]   on a strict one-month deadline.
[00:22:04.940 --> 00:22:07.260]   The penalties are very large if they don't do it.
[00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:09.460]   And so people panicked.
[00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:12.220]   But yeah, even though he looked like he shouldn't even
[00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:15.340]   be in a drinking age, it was a fascinating talk.
[00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:16.500]   So they can tweak these.
[00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:19.860]   Because the whole idea of GDPR is they evolved them.
[00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:22.020]   Because they knew that they were going to run into instances
[00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:25.100]   where the law didn't quite meet the reality
[00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:27.060]   of doing business online.
[00:22:27.060 --> 00:22:30.340]   So I'm hoping that they go back and change it,
[00:22:30.340 --> 00:22:31.260]   not just get rid of it.
[00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:34.820]   Because there are parts of GDPR that are a great idea.
[00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:37.740]   Getting real penalties for companies violating your data
[00:22:37.740 --> 00:22:39.420]   security is a great idea.
[00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:42.420]   The whole-- every website ever has to ask you
[00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:43.540]   if it's OK to put cookies.
[00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:44.300]   That's stupid.
[00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:45.140]   That's really stupid.
[00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:46.460]   It doesn't work.
[00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:47.620]   So let's go.
[00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:50.300]   A search engine ballot on your Android device.
[00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:53.220]   That companies pay to be on.
[00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:54.540]   Talk about unintended consequences.
[00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:56.060]   It's a bizarre, bizarre state of--
[00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:57.900]   What are the stories we're important?
[00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:00.700]   Well, we've just had a case, a story which
[00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:03.140]   sort of broke on Thursday afternoon.
[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:06.980]   Now, unlike-- well, some shows like RSA,
[00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:09.220]   they sell their keynotes, basically.
[00:23:09.220 --> 00:23:10.820]   Companies give them enough money.
[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:12.900]   And so Blackhouse started doing this.
[00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:13.820]   But it's a special--
[00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:15.940]   It seems like a bad idea to be like me selling a seat
[00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:17.500]   at the table during this win.
[00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.540]   Now they do it as a-- they bill it as a sponsor.
[00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:20.860]   Well, that's not a bad idea.
[00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:22.780]   I mean, they would get caught up.
[00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:25.980]   OK, I can give you a lesson from universities.
[00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:27.220]   You're not selling a seat.
[00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:29.620]   You're offering an endowed chair.
[00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:30.620]   Yeah.
[00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:31.500]   Endowed chair.
[00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:32.580]   That's going to be an endowed chair,
[00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:34.180]   because that means you can accept money for it.
[00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:34.700]   Yeah.
[00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:35.660]   Well, I'm an endowed chair.
[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:37.340]   But so--
[00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:38.540]   I mean, I'm so tiny.
[00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:39.460]   You can't do it right now.
[00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:40.300]   You can't say this.
[00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:41.100]   You can't do it.
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:41.820]   I don't get one.
[00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:42.820]   I don't get one.
[00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:43.500]   I'm fine.
[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.820]   Can I borrow your shirt?
[00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:49.020]   So anyway, one of these sponsored
[00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:51.980]   presentations was done by this company called Crown Sterling,
[00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:56.220]   who gave this long present--
[00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:59.740]   By the way, the name Crown Sterling alone sounds like a hoax.
[00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:01.740]   It's like it's not serious.
[00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:04.380]   They think they've come up with this brand new encryption
[00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:05.780]   scheme, which is--
[00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:07.220]   Always be suspicious.
[00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:09.860]   They actually say based on the rhythm of music
[00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:10.660]   and--
[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:12.620]   Yeah, you watch the video and it's got more buzz--
[00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:14.660]   it's got buzz words that the Deep Act chokerable choker
[00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:16.740]   will be ashamed to say in public.
[00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:17.860]   Kind of sounded like the six--
[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:20.940]   --and 12th chakra to mix--
[00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:21.460]   Yeah.
[00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:22.540]   It was rubbish.
[00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:24.820]   And so people actually stood up in the presentation and said,
[00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:29.220]   look, not only is this rubbish, but it's dangerous rubbish
[00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:32.500]   because you're trying to persuade people
[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:35.620]   to use this ridiculous encryption system.
[00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:37.620]   And they're now suing the organizers--
[00:24:37.620 --> 00:24:38.180]   What?
[00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:40.820]   --because they're saying, well, you should have made sure
[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:43.740]   that people are going to be polite and listen to us.
[00:24:43.740 --> 00:24:45.580]   You can't sue somebody for getting booed.
[00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:46.580]   Exactly.
[00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:48.620]   I mean, the ultimate sour grades.
[00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:51.420]   And it's caused a real stir within the conference
[00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:54.260]   attendees as well because a lot of people--
[00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.220]   the people on the review board for Black Hat
[00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:58.580]   who decide what go on, they don't get any input
[00:24:58.580 --> 00:24:59.500]   into the commercial stuff.
[00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:02.100]   And they would have picked up on this immediately.
[00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:02.740]   But I'm sorry.
[00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:05.700]   You can't just go into one of the biggest and best security
[00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:08.140]   conferences on the land, spout this kind of stuff,
[00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:10.380]   and not expect people to take the Mickey ad of you.
[00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:11.940]   Yeah.
[00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:13.380]   You should know better than that.
[00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:16.300]   Yeah, but they're claiming it was an organized conspiracy
[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:17.540]   and it really wasn't.
[00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:19.140]   I mean, I've spoken to people who are in there
[00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:21.700]   and they just-- they couldn't keep a lid on it anymore
[00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:22.780]   when the bull starts going.
[00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:23.620]   I think this was set up by the fact
[00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:27.300]   that there are events where, as a company, you can do that.
[00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:29.580]   You can pay for a friendly audience.
[00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:32.100]   You can pay for a polite audience.
[00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:34.420]   They just didn't realize that Black Hat wasn't
[00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:35.300]   one of those places.
[00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:36.380]   Out of the mechanics of that work--
[00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:38.060]   I've been to a lot of keynotes at different types
[00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:39.020]   of conferences in my life.
[00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:41.180]   Even individual companies doing their own thing.
[00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:43.940]   How do you ensure people are polite to you?
[00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:45.340]   So you reach out to the PR people
[00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:47.700]   and you say, which reporters do you have
[00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:50.500]   who are going to be receptive to an idea?
[00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:52.140]   And by the way, we're going to invite them to dinner
[00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:54.340]   or maybe we're taking them to a special event.
[00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:57.020]   And if that happens, there's that kind of--
[00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:59.300]   there's that tit for tat thing in the back of your mind,
[00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:01.140]   which is, OK, this is BS, but you know what?
[00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:02.180]   They took me to a nice place, so I'm
[00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:04.300]   going to shut up for the next 35 minutes.
[00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:05.300]   As opposed to booing--
[00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:06.300]   They say--
[00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:09.660]   They say Black Hat has a standard of conduct for attendees
[00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:11.860]   and they didn't enforce it in this case.
[00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:13.060]   Well, the guy that tackled them was
[00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:15.820]   escorted out by security.
[00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:19.060]   It's admittedly about two minutes after laying into them.
[00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:23.300]   Was there any possible merit in their post-solution?
[00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:24.060]   No.
[00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:28.260]   No, I've read the academic paper and it's just a mess
[00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:29.100]   of buzzwords.
[00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:31.460]   I've contacted the company to try and find out more information
[00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:33.580]   and have a nerd back.
[00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:35.820]   Everything I've seen, everyone I've spoken to,
[00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:37.500]   just like this is complete rubbish.
[00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:38.780]   They had that opportunity.
[00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:40.460]   They could have taken the moment to say, OK,
[00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:42.180]   people didn't understand our product.
[00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:43.060]   Let us explain it.
[00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:44.460]   They didn't do that, which tells me
[00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:46.660]   they don't even understand what they thought they were
[00:26:46.660 --> 00:26:48.220]   saying to people.
[00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:53.540]   It's conceivable that there are new and valuable encryption
[00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:54.820]   techniques out there.
[00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:55.940]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:58.780]   But I mean, the way to do that is to present evidence for them,
[00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:00.740]   not give this sort of happy, practical look about.
[00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:01.340]   It is math.
[00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:04.500]   And math has a certain kind of unbiased point of view.
[00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:07.780]   Yeah, I mean, but also, you know, the reason they paid the money
[00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:09.740]   for the presentation was so that they could say that they
[00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:12.140]   presented it Black Hat and get some kind of credibility
[00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:12.640]   from that.
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:13.620]   I've seen it Black Hat.
[00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:14.060]   Yeah.
[00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:15.020]   Yeah.
[00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:16.260]   Well, that didn't backfire at all.
[00:27:16.260 --> 00:27:17.540]   No, no.
[00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:19.820]   Now they're in the stores and the fact that we wouldn't have
[00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:21.380]   talked about as much if they weren't suing.
[00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:22.940]   Yeah, I would have known about it.
[00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:25.620]   So really lesson, everyone out there in the world of PR.
[00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:26.140]   Don't do that.
[00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:28.820]   And the thing is, they really didn't get upset
[00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:31.660]   until the social media outreach started.
[00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:34.500]   When people were posting slides from the presentation
[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:37.060]   and saying, does anybody understand this?
[00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:39.300]   So if it had just been some guy at Black
[00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:41.380]   who got up and heckled them, they probably
[00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:43.300]   would have said, OK, well, that's the cost of doing business.
[00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:46.420]   But this unintended social media backlash,
[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:47.820]   that's got them for a loop.
[00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:49.460]   Well, Black Hat actually pulled the presentation
[00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:51.620]   from his website, which is highly unusual.
[00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:53.620]   A lot of times after Defcon Black Hat
[00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:56.500]   besides we have stories about new hacks, new things
[00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:58.780]   to watch out for, new problems.
[00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:01.340]   This didn't seem to be producing a lot of those stories.
[00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:03.060]   No, but follow-ups.
[00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:05.220]   My favorite follow-up was Joseph Cox, who
[00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:08.020]   was the guy at Motherboard who broke the story about third
[00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:11.340]   parties being able to buy your real-time location data.
[00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:11.840]   You know, because--
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:12.500]   Oh, that was a great piece.
[00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:13.380]   That was a really good piece.
[00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:14.780]   It was a good presentation because he actually
[00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:15.940]   took everyone through.
[00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:19.540]   He said, initially we thought it was just bounty hunters,
[00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:20.780]   law enforcement.
[00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:22.580]   Turns out it can be stalkers.
[00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:26.700]   And he was saying, as cheap as $7.50 per location,
[00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:29.300]   per real-time location, and those accounts
[00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:31.340]   that allow you to do that, they don't charge you
[00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:33.380]   unless it's a successful ping.
[00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:34.980]   So you could just keep hitting someone
[00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:36.740]   until they turn their phone on.
[00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:39.060]   They get a ping, you get your notification
[00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:40.580]   and you're charged $7.50.
[00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:43.980]   But the follow-up for her story was, these companies have all
[00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:46.660]   said they've stopped doing business like that.
[00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:50.540]   And he said, but they've just switched which third party
[00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:52.100]   they're allowing to work with them.
[00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:55.580]   And it's still laughably easy for you to abuse that system.
[00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:57.500]   All you reason pay pay for this.
[00:28:57.500 --> 00:28:59.100]   Guy said, I was able to--
[00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:01.020]   I could stalk somebody using this.
[00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:02.460]   They didn't need to--
[00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:04.140]   Because they still have that allowance
[00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:07.900]   for legitimate law enforcement.
[00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:10.700]   But not actually Leo's people working with law enforcement.
[00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:11.700]   With law enforcement.
[00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:14.980]   The net goes from this size to enormous when you do that.
[00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:17.260]   I am shocked that there's not enough moral clarity
[00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:18.340]   from carriers.
[00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:20.620]   They're attending these such outstanding citizens.
[00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:23.060]   Oh, you sweet little fashion thing.
[00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:24.300]   That's sarcasm.
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:25.900]   That didn't come across.
[00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:26.860]   No, I'm not serious.
[00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:30.540]   The best new trend in 2019 is carriers sniping at other carriers.
[00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:32.180]   You see the one with the AT&T guys
[00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:34.140]   moved into the house and he's drinking his wine.
[00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:37.340]   And I think it's great if carriers start attacking other carriers,
[00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:39.420]   the whole house of cars will fall down.
[00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:41.580]   I did have hopes that T-Mobile will
[00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:42.860]   going to shake things up when--
[00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:44.860]   Well, this was an infinity ad saying,
[00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:46.500]   why you let AT&T in your house?
[00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:48.100]   We'll never know.
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:49.100]   Which I thought was great.
[00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:51.020]   I want to see AT&T snipe at Verizon.
[00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:53.060]   I want to see Verizon snipe at T-Mobile.
[00:29:53.060 --> 00:29:55.060]   I just want to see my contest connection and actually work
[00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:56.340]   at the speed I'm paying for.
[00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:57.420]   Hey, financial report.
[00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:58.420]   Yeah, who wouldn't?
[00:29:58.420 --> 00:29:59.180]   Financial reporter.
[00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:02.260]   What sprint T-Mobile is that going to go or no?
[00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:04.340]   It's more of a political question right now
[00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:05.740]   than it is a question for one.
[00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:07.020]   What's been approved by the feds?
[00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:09.020]   It's the states, the state AGs.
[00:30:09.020 --> 00:30:12.380]   And I think we're going to see some pushback from states
[00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:14.940]   like California and so forth, who are opposed to reducing
[00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:16.140]   the number of carriers from four to three
[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:19.300]   and they're from making it less competitive.
[00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:20.180]   I don't know.
[00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:22.300]   I mean, honestly, I want to have a better answer than that
[00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:23.500]   for you, Leo, but we'll see.
[00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:26.060]   Put aside all the politics for a second.
[00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:30.260]   And I want to ask honestly, doesn't it just make sense?
[00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:32.780]   Because T-Mobile or sprint alone cannot
[00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:34.380]   compete against Verizon or AT&T.
[00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:36.860]   It's the same reason that they allowed serious and ex-em
[00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:37.700]   to merge.
[00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:40.300]   There were only two satellite radio businesses.
[00:30:40.300 --> 00:30:41.300]   But there's a small--
[00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:43.820]   But neither one was going to succeed by itself.
[00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:45.660]   So they allowed them to merge, even though they in fact
[00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:48.420]   reduced the set to one.
[00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:50.980]   But you don't have competition in the mobile market.
[00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:52.500]   That is the fundamental problem.
[00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:54.100]   That's the difference for satellite radio competes
[00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:56.340]   with regular radio podcasts, everything else.
[00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:57.860]   And there's no competition for--
[00:30:57.860 --> 00:30:58.780]   That does get me.
[00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:00.900]   Because T-Mobile was a disruptive force.
[00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:02.260]   It really was.
[00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:02.620]   Yeah.
[00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:05.740]   And I'm very afraid you're going to lose that once it becomes
[00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:07.460]   as big as the other two.
[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:11.100]   And the plan was to let Dish become the new disruptor.
[00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:14.700]   And if you know Charlie Ergand at all, he is crazy.
[00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:16.180]   He is another John Ledger.
[00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:19.500]   He could absolutely be the wild iconoclast
[00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:21.100]   and drive the industry in new ways.
[00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:22.260]   But we already had one.
[00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:23.180]   He was covered in pink.
[00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:23.860]   He had pink socks.
[00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:25.220]   He cooked on Instagram live.
[00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:26.420]   It was the weirdest thing in the world.
[00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:28.540]   But he actually made enough of a splash
[00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:30.620]   to drive some changes in the space.
[00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:33.500]   And my thought is if you go from four to three,
[00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:35.620]   I don't know if that boosts his ability to do that.
[00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:36.980]   I think that probably actually makes him a bit more
[00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:38.340]   reticent to shake things down.
[00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:41.060]   He's now as big as 18 and that's my fit.
[00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:42.100]   That's my fit.
[00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:43.100]   One of the other problems is--
[00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:43.860]   But isn't that what happens to you?
[00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:45.900]   They have to shed some of the frequencies that they have
[00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:47.700]   in order to open up for another competitor.
[00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:50.300]   But you can't just take random frequencies,
[00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:52.740]   throw them together, and say you're now a viable competitor.
[00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:53.100]   No.
[00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:54.700]   And also, if we're going to go to three carriers,
[00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:56.940]   we can go back to four carriers, just start me at four
[00:31:56.940 --> 00:31:58.940]   and leave me there.
[00:31:58.940 --> 00:31:59.980]   Yeah, why?
[00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:01.300]   What's the point?
[00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:03.420]   Well, the point is so that they can make a lot more money.
[00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:03.940]   Yeah, but the--
[00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:05.300]   But I don't care about their profit market.
[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:05.740]   This is it.
[00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:07.980]   I mean, it's like when you come to the US,
[00:32:07.980 --> 00:32:11.300]   or I mean, you live in Rome on and off,
[00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:13.780]   and you've seen how much people pay for their mobiles there.
[00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:15.180]   And then you come here and it's just like--
[00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:15.540]   That's a couple of them.
[00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:17.100]   Oh, that hurts.
[00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:20.260]   I get unlimited data, unlimited voice, unlimited international.
[00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:21.620]   I pay five euros a month.
[00:32:21.620 --> 00:32:22.100]   What?
[00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:22.620]   Exactly.
[00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:22.900]   What?
[00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:23.980]   It's a Vatican plan.
[00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:24.500]   Oh, OK.
[00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:26.740]   Oh, he's got the special priest plan.
[00:32:26.740 --> 00:32:27.660]   That's the first time.
[00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:28.660]   I'm paying more--
[00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:29.500]   It's exclusive.
[00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:30.020]   Yeah, it's exclusive.
[00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:32.460]   You've got to go through a lot to get this plan.
[00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:33.860]   If you're in terms of conditions--
[00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:34.860]   Kind of feel about it.
[00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:36.620]   It's because it's not--
[00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:39.820]   if you're going to give up marriage, then maybe you can--
[00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:42.820]   So I mean, I can't have kids, but I've got a killer sell
[00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:44.500]   five euro.
[00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:49.020]   It's the La Familia plan.
[00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:52.940]   But you see, coming over here, my mobile costs doubled.
[00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:55.300]   My internet access costs doubled.
[00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:57.420]   And it's because you don't have proper competition
[00:32:57.420 --> 00:32:58.420]   in a free market.
[00:32:58.420 --> 00:32:59.780]   And terrible internet?
[00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:00.300]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:01.340]   Terrible internet.
[00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:02.700]   But how do you force that?
[00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:06.140]   So if you can't take two of the smallest carriers
[00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:09.900]   to make a competing carrier, the only other option, really,
[00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:11.740]   is to force the two largest carriers
[00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:15.060]   to shed some of their customer base and frequencies.
[00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:15.820]   How do you do that?
[00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:17.700]   Or you make it more attractive and you carve out
[00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:20.060]   spectrum specifically to allow for the introduction
[00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:21.060]   of the fifth provider.
[00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:21.540]   Right.
[00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:22.060]   I mean--
[00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:23.660]   The problem is we already sold the spectrum.
[00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:26.460]   So they so nft in the back, you know?
[00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:27.740]   But it's not the good spectrum.
[00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:29.340]   We want the good spectrum.
[00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:31.620]   Well, then maybe you force a redistribution of spectrum.
[00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:32.180]   Like you're saying.
[00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:33.940]   I mean, you might have to get radical about this.
[00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:36.860]   But there's no political will right now to do any work
[00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:38.700]   on the carriers in the tech world,
[00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:39.980]   while there is a lot of political will
[00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:42.900]   to break up tech companies, which are problematic
[00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:43.620]   for different reasons.
[00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:46.540]   But we're only seeing the tech lash hit Apple Google.
[00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:47.060]   It's true.
[00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:48.260]   Why isn't it hits me?
[00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:49.460]   These broadband--
[00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:52.460]   Because the head of the FCC is Verizon next to the left.
[00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:53.820]   And he will do--
[00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:56.060]   I mean, Adjut Pie or Adjut Pie is--
[00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:57.660]   he's referred to in the office--
[00:33:57.660 --> 00:34:00.260]   he will do whatever the carriers tell him to.
[00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:02.420]   He's been stalling rober calling legislation
[00:34:02.420 --> 00:34:04.940]   for the last two years, because it
[00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:08.020]   would hit the mobile phone, the telcos profits.
[00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:09.820]   He just-- every single decision he makes
[00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:13.340]   seems to be what would Verizon do.
[00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:15.700]   I mean, but we knew he was going to be that bad coming in.
[00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:18.180]   Like when Obama left and Trump is coming in,
[00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:19.860]   we all went, oh, it's going to be Adjut.
[00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:20.380]   Yeah.
[00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:21.220]   And it's going to be terrible.
[00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:23.220]   But remember, we thought Tom Wheeler would be like that.
[00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:23.740]   We did.
[00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:25.100]   I was wrong about Tom Wheeler.
[00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:26.980]   He also was a lobbyist for these companies.
[00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:28.140]   Yeah, I mean, that's who runs the FCC.
[00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:30.340]   He had his come to Jesus moment.
[00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:33.700]   The first time he tried to push that awful net neutrality
[00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:36.580]   bill, he flipped one 80s.
[00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:40.380]   And I think Chairman Pie has learned from that.
[00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:41.740]   The key is not to allow comments.
[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:42.240]   Yes.
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:43.420]   That's what he's trying to do in this case.
[00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:45.380]   But I think the Tom Wheeler example
[00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:47.620]   is the rare moment of government working.
[00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:50.020]   Tom Wheeler is now universally liked in the tech world,
[00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:53.340]   because he was honest and didn't pursue a rigid agenda
[00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:55.660]   and listened and really moved the ball forward.
[00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:56.060]   Yeah.
[00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:57.900]   I was very wrong about Tom Wheeler and all of them.
[00:34:57.900 --> 00:34:58.580]   I was too.
[00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:00.100]   I was too.
[00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:02.340]   So George Burns once said, it's a shame
[00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:04.300]   the only people who know how to run the country are cutting
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:06.340]   hair and drying cabs.
[00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:07.580]   I want to add--
[00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:10.140]   or podcasters.
[00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:11.540]   We're going to take a break.
[00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:15.340]   I feel like I'm mixing some context there.
[00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:17.260]   I'm just saying, you guys seem to know what to do.
[00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:18.740]   And I think we wish you were in charge.
[00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:19.740]   Let's revolution.
[00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:20.740]   Revolution.
[00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:23.180]   It's great to have Father Robert Ballisair back
[00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:27.100]   from the Vatican if only for a few short days.
[00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:30.620]   Thedigitaljazuitjazuit.org @podra SJ on the Twitter.
[00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:33.500]   Follow him on the tweets, because he's always a tweeter.
[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:35.380]   He's got great tweets.
[00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:39.980]   Also Ian Thompson, news editor at the register.co.uk.
[00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:44.180]   And Alex Wilhelm, the newly married Alex Wilhelm,
[00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:46.380]   the chief of Crunchbase News.
[00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:48.780]   Still splitting your time between the coasts?
[00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:49.300]   I am.
[00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:50.500]   I'm on a plane on Friday.
[00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:52.500]   And then back here on the 15th.
[00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:52.860]   All right.
[00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:55.100]   Well, we're really glad you're out here for right here.
[00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:58.380]   Our show today brought to you by LegalZoom.
[00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:01.180]   And in more ways than one, when it came time to start
[00:36:01.180 --> 00:36:04.020]   Twitter 15 years ago, I asked Kevin Rose, what should I do?
[00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:05.460]   I want to start a company.
[00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:06.860]   He said, go to LegalZoom.
[00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:10.380]   The first thing you do, create an LLC with LegalZoom.
[00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:13.220]   The next thing you do, trademark your name and your logo.
[00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:14.460]   And I did all that.
[00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:15.900]   And the thing is, this--
[00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:16.500]   it's just me.
[00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:18.060]   It was a very small startup.
[00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:21.820]   I didn't have the money to go to a fancy lawyer at $350
[00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:22.860]   an hour.
[00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:24.140]   LegalZoom was affordable.
[00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:25.500]   It was easy.
[00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:27.460]   I was able to get the legal work.
[00:36:27.460 --> 00:36:28.500]   I needed it done.
[00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:29.220]   And that's great.
[00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:31.300]   Since then, we've used LegalZoom for many other things.
[00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:34.180]   It's national make a will month right now.
[00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:37.140]   LegalZoom is a great way to make your will.
[00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:39.060]   For more than 18 years, LegalZoom has developed
[00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:42.260]   a very straightforward way for you
[00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:43.820]   to protect what you care about the most.
[00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:45.820]   You are family and your assets.
[00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:48.620]   And it all starts with a last will or a living
[00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:50.700]   trust estate plan.
[00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:54.180]   And I know when I say living trust, people go, oh, that sounds
[00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:54.860]   complicated.
[00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:56.260]   Don't worry, LegalZoom can help you.
[00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:59.020]   They have a lot of stuff online, resources.
[00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:00.820]   It can help you figure out what's right for you.
[00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:03.180]   In fact, I was just reading funny that I should be bringing
[00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:03.500]   this up.
[00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:05.100]   I was just reading the LegalZoom pages
[00:37:05.100 --> 00:37:08.460]   on a revicably living trust.
[00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:10.820]   But even then, you can go farther
[00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:13.300]   because they have a network of independent attorneys.
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:15.300]   They're not a law firm, but they have worked
[00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:17.140]   to contract with attorneys in every state
[00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:20.020]   that can provide advice if you need more direction.
[00:37:20.020 --> 00:37:21.620]   You're not going to be billed by the hour.
[00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:23.020]   It's not a law firm.
[00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:27.260]   But you can at a flat rate find the information you need
[00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:30.220]   to get things done and do it fast and easy
[00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:31.780]   and get real clarity.
[00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:34.900]   A million people now, a million of Canada LegalZoom
[00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:36.940]   for a will or a living trust.
[00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:40.220]   Before another summer passes by, you should too.
[00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:41.220]   This is it.
[00:37:41.220 --> 00:37:42.820]   National Make a Will Month LegalZoom.
[00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:45.620]   I know you've been thinking about it.
[00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:46.380]   That was a time.
[00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:47.940]   Do a health care directive?
[00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:49.940]   I just did that too.
[00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:51.660]   And if you have pets, even if you don't have kids,
[00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:54.020]   if you have pets, they actually can make a will
[00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:55.460]   saying what happens to your pets
[00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:56.740]   if something should happen to you.
[00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:57.780]   That's an important thing to do.
[00:37:57.780 --> 00:38:02.380]   You don't want to just let Fido languish.
[00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:04.660]   Make things easier for those you care about the most.
[00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:06.740]   Check out LegalZoom's last will and living trust
[00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:08.100]   estate plans.

[00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:37.700]   as I said, and they do a great job.
[00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:40.540]   Android Q is not a dessert.
[00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:42.340]   End of the world.
[00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:43.140]   They had to do it.
[00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:43.140]   I knew it.
[00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:44.300]   I am so pleased.
[00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:45.500]   I know, eventually.
[00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:47.420]   Oh my god, it was endless.
[00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:48.860]   And what Google said--
[00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:49.700]   But what were they going to do?
[00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:52.020]   I mean, when it was pie, I don't know.
[00:38:52.020 --> 00:38:52.940]   We were thinking--
[00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:56.100]   Absolutely not a dessert, even if you put cinnamon and sugar.
[00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:57.820]   Put sugar in that stuff.
[00:38:57.820 --> 00:38:59.860]   It's about as disgusting as before.
[00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:00.900]   And this is the problem.
[00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:03.020]   And finally, Google acknowledged it.
[00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:05.460]   These were internal code names.
[00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:08.940]   And somehow, they pointed out internationally,
[00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:10.380]   it doesn't make sense.
[00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:12.980]   People don't know what KitKat bar-- actually, they do.
[00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:14.020]   That's a bad example.
[00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:16.500]   But that's part of the problem, Oreos.
[00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:20.260]   Newgood, nougat, or is pronounced differently in it.
[00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:22.460]   Nougat, as your people say.
[00:39:22.460 --> 00:39:23.740]   No, no.
[00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:25.180]   It's like aluminum.
[00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:26.900]   So they've just said, oh, it should just be huge.
[00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:27.900]   We invented this stuff.
[00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:29.340]   Actually, it's Android 10.
[00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:29.940]   Yeah, right?
[00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:31.260]   Not even cute.
[00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:32.860]   That bothers me more than anything else.
[00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:35.220]   Why is 10 the new starting point for every--
[00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:36.140]   Well, we were at nine.
[00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:36.860]   Go back in time.
[00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:37.820]   Where's windows nine?
[00:39:37.820 --> 00:39:38.540]   I'm still in line.
[00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:39.140]   I know, exactly.
[00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:41.260]   Why is Android 9?
[00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:44.780]   iPhone 10, Windows 10, Android 10.
[00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:46.420]   I mean, maybe it's 10 of ideas.
[00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:47.180]   It could have been worse.
[00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:49.100]   It could have made it an X.
[00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:51.060]   That would have really been a frustration.
[00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:51.700]   Tesla 10?
[00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:52.860]   Or wait, no, that was Tesla X.
[00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:53.500]   That was nice.
[00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:54.660]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:55.780]   I didn't even think of that.
[00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:59.020]   But it's 10 because, logically, they just did nine.
[00:39:59.020 --> 00:39:59.500]   Yeah.
[00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:00.340]   I'm going to miss the whimsier.
[00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:02.500]   I'm going to miss the statues.
[00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:02.980]   Yes.
[00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:05.180]   On the Google campus, they went to each major release.
[00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:05.500]   Yeah.
[00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:06.340]   They were cute.
[00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:07.860]   They were cute.
[00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:08.700]   It'll be out soon.
[00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:11.260]   This is a bad time to buy a phone.
[00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:14.500]   Lisa is, as we speak, at the genius bar at the Apple Store
[00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:17.860]   because her iPhone 10s is funky as heck.
[00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:19.420]   And it died while we were on a trip.
[00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:20.940]   And I gave her mine.
[00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:22.580]   And she says, yours is so much faster.
[00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:24.500]   I said, I've told you, you've been suffering with this phone
[00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:25.940]   for almost a year.
[00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:27.940]   But I said, but why bring it to the Apple Store?
[00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:31.740]   You're getting a new one in three weeks.
[00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:32.900]   And then I got a question.
[00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:34.820]   Should I bring a Pixel XL?
[00:40:34.820 --> 00:40:36.300]   This is on a new show, Ask the Tech guys.
[00:40:36.300 --> 00:40:39.980]   Guys, should I bring a fancy camera or the Pixel 3
[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:41.420]   with me on my next trip?
[00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:43.060]   And I said, well, don't bring the Pixel 3
[00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:44.460]   and bring the Pixel 4.
[00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:46.220]   That's going to be out in two months.
[00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:47.260]   And I just got--
[00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:51.740]   It's charging on my built-in cheat charger on my Lenovo screen.
[00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:54.700]   I just got the shimmer version of the note.
[00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:56.140]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:40:56.140 --> 00:41:01.340]   So this is a perfect example of why we are past Pete's smartphone.
[00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:03.140]   It's like a seventh grader's pencil box.
[00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:06.140]   There's nothing more you can do on a smartphone, right?
[00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:07.060]   They've done it all.
[00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:11.260]   So now everybody in every review said, but the shimmery back.
[00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:12.620]   So it's a rainbow.
[00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:13.300]   Let me get the straight.
[00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:14.860]   The new innovation is glitter.
[00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:16.660]   Yes.
[00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:17.860]   Literally.
[00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:18.340]   All right.
[00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:18.860]   All right.
[00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:19.780]   So I have a question.
[00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:21.100]   So I was preparing for the show today.
[00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:23.460]   I was reading through all the Apple news about the new iPhones
[00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:23.980]   and all this.
[00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:25.460]   It's all rumor we don't know for real.
[00:41:25.460 --> 00:41:25.820]   Oh, sorry.
[00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:27.060]   All the Apple rumor news.
[00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:28.820]   Which now, these days, correct most of the time.
[00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:30.060]   Most of the time, yeah.
[00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:31.540]   I have an iPhone 7.
[00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:33.020]   I'm going to get a new iPhone.
[00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:35.460]   I don't really care which one.
[00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:37.940]   Should I just wait and buy whatever the mid-range option is?
[00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:38.780]   Is that the right way to go?
[00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:40.220]   Don't get a phone now.
[00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:42.100]   People on Twitter have already made that very clear.
[00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:43.100]   Yeah.
[00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:44.380]   I got shouted at it a little bit.
[00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:46.220]   But are any of the new phones going to be fine?
[00:41:46.220 --> 00:41:47.780]   Is anything special about them as you care about the phone?
[00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:50.620]   I'm still used to having a phone for more than two years.
[00:41:50.620 --> 00:41:51.620]   That's kind of like the thing.
[00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:51.620]   Yeah.
[00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:54.820]   I mean, I wish I could because I don't want to--
[00:41:54.820 --> 00:41:57.980]   literally, these are $5,000 and $6,000 quarters for me.
[00:41:57.980 --> 00:41:59.500]   Because I have to buy all these new.
[00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:01.060]   And they're all over $1,000.
[00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:01.580]   Yeah.
[00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:02.220]   It's gone crazy.
[00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:03.780]   And I don't-- I mean, I don't have any need for them.
[00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:04.540]   But I got a review.
[00:42:04.540 --> 00:42:05.660]   Am I going to talk about them?
[00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:08.380]   By the way, the Note 10 plus, very nice, but not particularly
[00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:10.020]   nicer than the S10 plus.
[00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:11.380]   I've got to say, I was very impressed
[00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:13.180]   with I bought Pixel 3A.
[00:42:13.180 --> 00:42:14.740]   I was thinking, "Three is a good choice."
[00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:16.340]   It's a very good phone.
[00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:18.620]   It does some weird thing that I'm just trying to find.
[00:42:18.620 --> 00:42:21.460]   I took it out to a Mon holiday in Scotland.
[00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:23.300]   And it's not there.
[00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:25.620]   There was a picture of-- I took a picture of one of those
[00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:27.700]   Harlan cows, the big shaggy ones.
[00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:29.940]   And it looked like it was levitating.
[00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:30.940]   It was-- I don't know what's going on.
[00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:31.780]   That's the new feature.
[00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:32.780]   Yeah.
[00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:33.580]   Flying house.
[00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:34.540]   Yogi shot.
[00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:37.180]   See, I'm stuck because I refuse to buy a phone.
[00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:37.740]   What are you using?
[00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:39.180]   I'm not having a video.
[00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:39.740]   Not on yet.
[00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:41.340]   Well, that's the big--
[00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:42.100]   I want that.
[00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:46.980]   I think in some ways, besides the shimmery back of the Note
[00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:48.700]   10 plus, that's the other big story.
[00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:51.380]   Samsung's finally giving up after years of mocking up
[00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:52.820]   for taking out that Fudg.
[00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:53.940]   Is it so brave?
[00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:54.820]   It's a courage, man.
[00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:57.420]   They said, well, we want to put a bigger battery in there.
[00:42:57.420 --> 00:42:58.820]   And so we could add a little--
[00:42:58.820 --> 00:42:59.980]   we've got a scosh more room.
[00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:01.460]   We could put a bigger battery in there.
[00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:03.340]   But I don't know.
[00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:05.340]   Are you an AirPods user now or equivalent?
[00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:07.180]   They're so awful.
[00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:09.780]   They're so awful, aren't they?
[00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:10.900]   They're so convenient.
[00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:12.220]   I've moved over to them.
[00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:14.980]   Oh, how many of them have you lost, though?
[00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:16.980]   Between Liza and I, we own three pairs.
[00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:17.500]   Yeah, right.
[00:43:17.500 --> 00:43:18.500]   We've lost none.
[00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:20.020]   But I have broken one of them.
[00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:20.340]   Yeah.
[00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:21.700]   So you have two functioning pairs.
[00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:22.740]   They're not comfortable.
[00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:23.060]   No.
[00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:23.980]   Your ears hurt.
[00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:24.420]   Yes.
[00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:25.420]   The sound sucks.
[00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:26.220]   Yes.
[00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:27.940]   That doesn't seal your ears, so you
[00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:31.580]   tend to turn it up too loud, which is deafening.
[00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:34.860]   And you look like you've got dribble coming out of your ear.
[00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:37.420]   What's the upside?
[00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:40.540]   Better phone call audio quality.
[00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:41.540]   In my experience.
[00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:42.540]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:42.540]   Hold on.
[00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:44.180]   What's a phone call?
[00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:45.860]   It's because when you live far from your partner,
[00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:48.020]   as you're talking about a lot, how do you talk on the phone?
[00:43:48.020 --> 00:43:49.180]   Yeah, I do a lot of face on the phone.
[00:43:49.180 --> 00:43:52.260]   So I do use the Jabra Elite, which are--
[00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:53.140]   they seal.
[00:43:53.140 --> 00:43:54.260]   They fit a little better in the ear.
[00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:54.900]   They don't fall off.
[00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:56.540]   The sound is infinitely better.
[00:43:56.540 --> 00:43:57.820]   And they're somewhat more comfortable
[00:43:57.820 --> 00:43:59.180]   where they have interchangeable tips.
[00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:00.660]   I just do understand.
[00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:03.220]   Getting rid of the string is a nice thing.
[00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:04.580]   It's nice not to have a core.
[00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:06.460]   Yeah, but you go to a place like Defcon,
[00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:09.380]   and you bring up your scanner and see all these iPhones
[00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:10.500]   with Bluetooth all over the phone.
[00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:11.500]   Go out.
[00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:12.500]   OK.
[00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:14.060]   Well, you know, they're beakening.
[00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:15.700]   We've talked about this several times now.
[00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:16.700]   They're beakening.
[00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:18.500]   All the Apple stuff, beakens.
[00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:21.140]   This failed technology, the Bluetooth beacon technology
[00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:22.980]   that Apple was so high on.
[00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:24.660]   Oh, you'll walk into a gap.
[00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:26.580]   And as you walk by the Levi's pile of--
[00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:27.580]   They'll know it's you.
[00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:28.580]   Over here.
[00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:29.580]   Over here, Leo.
[00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:30.580]   You got to do them on Levi's.
[00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:31.580]   I didn't want that.
[00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:33.060]   No one wanted it except Mr. Gap.
[00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:34.740]   And Apple thought there was going
[00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:37.260]   to be the next big thing you write that cow is levitated.
[00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:38.220]   Isn't it?
[00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:39.900]   I don't know what's going on in the Pixel phone,
[00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:40.900]   but that is just you.
[00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:41.900]   Well, then we held it.
[00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:43.820]   And we paste that picture into the chat on the thing
[00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:44.820]   so I could show people.
[00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:48.020]   There's something that the Pixel did too much computation.
[00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:49.020]   That's a little too much computation.
[00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:52.060]   It looks like a really bad Photoshop of a yak.
[00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:53.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:53.060 --> 00:44:56.060]   Well, I did get accused of Photoshoping this.
[00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:57.060]   And I--
[00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:58.060]   Interesting thing.
[00:44:58.060 --> 00:45:00.140]   I've read a number of articles now with the reviews
[00:45:00.140 --> 00:45:02.980]   of the Note 10 Plus, which is, in theory,
[00:45:02.980 --> 00:45:03.980]   it's the newest camera.
[00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:07.900]   It's got three lenses, wide telephoto, normal.
[00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:09.820]   It's got computational photography.
[00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:11.780]   It's got a time of flight sensor on it,
[00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:13.420]   so it knows three dimensions.
[00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:14.420]   It could do all this stuff.
[00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:17.060]   In theory, it should be the greatest camera phone out there.
[00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:19.340]   And I've read numerous articles comparing it
[00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:22.820]   to the one-year-old Pixel 3, saying the Pixel 3 is better.
[00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:23.580]   Oh, man.
[00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:26.340]   With one lens, all computation.
[00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:28.380]   But sometimes computation goes wrong.
[00:45:28.380 --> 00:45:31.500]   OK, they got to show you this picture because--
[00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:32.900]   Did you send it, put it in the chat?
[00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:33.420]   I put it out.
[00:45:33.420 --> 00:45:34.420]   I tweeted it out.
[00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:35.420]   Oh, you tweeted it?
[00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:35.900]   Yes.
[00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:37.540]   What is this tweet of which you speak?
[00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:39.380]   This is first you're back on, it seems like.
[00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:41.180]   Yeah, I couldn't really.
[00:45:41.180 --> 00:45:42.380]   Are you Ian Thompson?
[00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:45.100]   Yeah, or one word?
[00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:46.580]   I-A-I-E.
[00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:50.740]   Oh, that's like a deep, fake AI nightmare.
[00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:51.820]   I just just threw one.
[00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:52.380]   Hold on.
[00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:53.660]   We're almost there.
[00:45:53.660 --> 00:46:00.420]   How do you spell I-A-I-N-T-H-O-M-S-O-N-N-O-P?
[00:46:00.420 --> 00:46:01.300]   OK, this is--
[00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:02.340]   What are they doing in this?
[00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:02.820]   Yeah.
[00:46:02.820 --> 00:46:05.500]   This is something-- and this is straight out of the camera.
[00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:06.660]   Yeah.
[00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:08.860]   And people accused me of Photoshop
[00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:11.740]   being in a cow, which first of all, in Scotland,
[00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:12.660]   why would I do that?
[00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:13.660]   You know, this is a very hard thing
[00:46:13.660 --> 00:46:16.140]   to do in augmented reality, which is to get the--
[00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:17.220]   this is crazy.
[00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:20.220]   If you would Photoshop a shadow right under here,
[00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:21.500]   it would be floating.
[00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:22.900]   It is bizarre.
[00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:25.340]   There is something about the picture that just looks off.
[00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:25.860]   Yeah.
[00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:26.860]   I don't--
[00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:28.340]   I don't even know what it is.
[00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:29.980]   Painting things, right there, almost.
[00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:32.060]   And how you can't get into lay flat when you paint them.
[00:46:32.060 --> 00:46:35.020]   Like, this is that, but like the really weird actual real
[00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:36.060]   version of it.
[00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:37.060]   Yeah.
[00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:38.060]   You know what?
[00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:39.060]   This is actually a really important photo,
[00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:41.140]   because it demonstrates how much computational
[00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:42.220]   photography is going on.
[00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:43.380]   It's exactly in the camera.
[00:46:43.380 --> 00:46:44.740]   In the camera.
[00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:46.620]   And while most of the time it's great,
[00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:48.060]   night sight is amazing.
[00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:48.820]   Yep.
[00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:50.980]   I just think that the quality of the images
[00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:53.500]   that come off the Pixel 3 XL and the Pixel 3,
[00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:56.020]   and even the A, which doesn't have that smart chip,
[00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:57.900]   but still manages to do quite a bit,
[00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:00.900]   is better than any of the more recent cameras.
[00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:01.900]   Yeah.
[00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:02.900]   Except--
[00:47:02.900 --> 00:47:03.900]   Except for--
[00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:04.900]   Sometimes--
[00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:06.460]   Sometimes you get a flying cow.
[00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:07.460]   [COUGHING]
[00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:10.660]   This is going to change our perception of what a real image is
[00:47:10.660 --> 00:47:11.660]   and is not.
[00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:12.980]   Well, it's not going to become normal.
[00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:14.380]   This is a very good subject right now,
[00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:17.140]   because we've been talking a lot about deep fakes.
[00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:19.020]   We've been talking about computational photography,
[00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:21.780]   talking about truth.
[00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:26.220]   And we're in an era now where I think it's pretty safe to say,
[00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:30.820]   you cannot assume that any image or video you're watching
[00:47:30.820 --> 00:47:32.260]   is the actual--
[00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:34.660]   used to say pictures didn't happen.
[00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:35.660]   Yeah.
[00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:36.660]   And it didn't happen.
[00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:37.660]   Mm-hmm.
[00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:38.660]   Fake right.
[00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:39.660]   When everything moves to--
[00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:40.660]   The conversation comes with that fake moves.
[00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:41.660]   It's all fake.
[00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:42.660]   Yeah.
[00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:43.660]   None of it's actually real.
[00:47:43.660 --> 00:47:44.660]   It's not a captured frame.
[00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:45.660]   Yeah.
[00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:47.300]   It's a reconstituted computational image.
[00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:50.380]   Well, there's some interesting work being done in the AI field.
[00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:52.980]   Everyone's familiar with deep fakes now.
[00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:53.980]   Yeah.
[00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:56.780]   But now the real gold rush is finding out the anti-deep fakes
[00:47:56.780 --> 00:48:00.540]   technology, being able to train our systems to spot deep fakes.
[00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:02.820]   And this was one of the talks that came up in Black Hat.
[00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:04.660]   They're actually using mice to do it.
[00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:05.660]   Yeah.
[00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:06.660]   Yeah.
[00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:07.660]   Mice can spot it than a fifth gator.
[00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:08.660]   Surely.
[00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:11.260]   Well, the thinking behind it is this.
[00:48:11.260 --> 00:48:15.340]   Mice are very good at detecting human voices and actual human voices.
[00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:17.500]   And they're also, as it turns out, quite good at defective--
[00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:19.460]   Because it's fake ones as well.
[00:48:19.460 --> 00:48:20.940]   It's a life or death thing for them.
[00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:21.940]   Yeah.
[00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:23.980]   So basically what they've done is they've wired some brains up.
[00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:27.820]   They-- as mice brains up, they look at the neural patterns when they're listening to speech
[00:48:27.820 --> 00:48:31.860]   and they can predict with 70% accuracy whether this is an actual human speaking or whether
[00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:32.860]   this is a deep fake.
[00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:36.420]   Obviously, there's some work to be done on this and the mice are particularly happy about
[00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:37.420]   it.
[00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:40.780]   But there are some interesting bits of research going on in how to spot those.
[00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:46.100]   I talked on Friday with Hacker Bikrypt, who was really wonderful.
[00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:48.020]   Really enjoyed talking to her.
[00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:52.620]   And she was talking about her friend Aviva Ovagya, who predicted the fake news crisis
[00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:53.860]   in 2016.
[00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:57.940]   He calls what's about to happen the info apocalypse.
[00:48:57.940 --> 00:49:05.140]   And this is the side effect, perhaps, of fake news, deep fakes, photoshops, is that at some
[00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:07.860]   point you don't trust anything.
[00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:14.540]   And what was at one-- it has been until recently an amazing variety of information.
[00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:18.860]   Your fingertips now becomes nothing if this continues.
[00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:22.180]   You don't know what's true or not, and so you don't trust anything.
[00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:28.820]   There was a panel at DevCon up in one of the towers on deepfakes, and it was interesting
[00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:33.780]   because there was one comment that said, "People assume that this is about trust, finding the
[00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:37.500]   way to put trust into an image into our video."
[00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:39.540]   The problem is we're looking at it backwards.
[00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:40.540]   This is not about trust.
[00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:42.180]   This is about confirmation bias.
[00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:44.220]   Do you believe what you want to believe?
[00:49:44.220 --> 00:49:49.180]   You find what confirms your suspicions, and deepfakes are allowing that.
[00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:53.740]   So unless you can solve for that, for the fact that people want to confirm their bias,
[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:58.260]   which we can't, by the way, it's spoiler, then the deepfake technology is not really
[00:49:58.260 --> 00:49:59.260]   the issue.
[00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:00.620]   It's a symptom of the issue.
[00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:03.780]   I mean, people fall for all sorts of Photoshop stuff on Facebook today.
[00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:04.780]   That's very, very unsophisticated.
[00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:07.180]   Saying this can be more sophisticated isn't very--
[00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:08.740]   Maybe the mice will save us.
[00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:10.940]   Can we go back and help me with something?
[00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:12.500]   Computational photography.
[00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:13.500]   Ah.
[00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:15.020]   So I'm the dumb one at the table.
[00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:16.020]   What's that?
[00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:22.060]   It's basically the image processing software within the camera, which is then used to improve
[00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:23.740]   the image before you actually see it.
[00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:27.660]   As a perfect example, this Pixel 3a doesn't have a very big sensor.
[00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:30.740]   As a tiny lens, that's not very good, not very good glass.
[00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:32.260]   It's only a few elements.
[00:50:32.260 --> 00:50:36.020]   So the information going into the camera is terrible.
[00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:42.580]   But it's able to, because this is a powerful computer, and the Pixel 3 XL, at least, and
[00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:47.500]   the Pixel 3 have a dedicated processor just for image processing.
[00:50:47.500 --> 00:50:52.380]   They're able to make images that look better in many cases than a high-end camera from
[00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:53.940]   this lousy input.
[00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:54.940]   So it's almost like--
[00:50:54.940 --> 00:50:56.940]   Except sometimes you get a floating--
[00:50:56.940 --> 00:50:59.820]   Quality, because of the computer itself, or the floating yak.
[00:50:59.820 --> 00:51:00.820]   Okay.
[00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:03.420]   We've actually been using it for a long time, even in non-sophisticated cameras.
[00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:04.420]   We call it HDR.
[00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:06.740]   HDR is a form of computational imagery.
[00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:07.740]   Wow.
[00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:12.060]   Because you take two images that could not exist at the same time on that sensor, and
[00:51:12.060 --> 00:51:13.420]   you composite them together.
[00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:17.580]   You take one at the extreme high range of exposure, and at the low range of exposure,
[00:51:17.580 --> 00:51:19.100]   and then you put them together.
[00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:24.100]   So computational imagery is just that multiplied a couple of times.
[00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:28.500]   You're now taking data that never existed as an actual bit of information coming into
[00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:30.260]   the sensor, and you're forming an image around it.
[00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:33.980]   So now photos that I take with my iPhone 7, which I presume has some of this technology,
[00:51:33.980 --> 00:51:35.740]   aren't actually representations of reality.
[00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:37.780]   They are touched up by the phone itself and how it does.
[00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:39.420]   In fact, that's a good point.
[00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:40.420]   So I mean--
[00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:42.420]   That's how you get real, and we're all in--
[00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:44.460]   That's how you get fake moves.
[00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:45.460]   Fake moves?
[00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:47.020]   Yeah, you get floating cows.
[00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:48.020]   We don't.
[00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:49.020]   [laughter]
[00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:52.180]   This is an example of Google's nights.
[00:51:52.180 --> 00:51:56.100]   Actually, this is the iPhone XS on the left.
[00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:57.100]   It was dark.
[00:51:57.100 --> 00:51:58.100]   It's Central Park.
[00:51:58.100 --> 00:51:59.100]   You can't see a lot of detail.
[00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:00.340]   You can see the buildings behind.
[00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:04.980]   But the nights, and this is the Google Pixel on the right, what it does is it takes as
[00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:07.500]   many as 12 images.
[00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:11.660]   It looks for the stuff that doesn't move in those 12 images, and it stacks them.
[00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:14.380]   It does multiple exposures, and it stacks them.
[00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:15.380]   HDR.
[00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:16.380]   HDR with one shot.
[00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:18.900]   With one shot, in effect, except that it's 12 shots with one button.
[00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:23.100]   We should say that HDR really started as sort of an analog phenomenon when photographers
[00:52:23.100 --> 00:52:24.100]   realize it could take--
[00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:25.100]   It's stacked negatives.
[00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:26.100]   Correct, correct.
[00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:28.100]   And then we just made it far more sophisticated.
[00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:32.020]   I'm not opposed to progress, but I did not know the fact that there was that much computer
[00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:34.940]   work behind images that I currently take with these phones.
[00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:35.940]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:36.940]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:42.220]   When it became popular, there was a whole side movement that said that is a talent.
[00:52:42.220 --> 00:52:43.700]   That's not real photography.
[00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:45.300]   You have to find the image.
[00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:46.300]   You can't just make the image.
[00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:51.460]   Well, I think photojournalists have always had the ethos that you don't change the image.
[00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:53.220]   Yeah, you'd clean it up a bit.
[00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:59.900]   You could maybe brighten it, but you can't do-- what you really can't do is regional retouching.
[00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:01.420]   You could do an overall brightening.
[00:53:01.420 --> 00:53:02.940]   You could change the contrast.
[00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:06.420]   But what you can't do is say, "I'm going to retouch this," or retouch that.
[00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:08.980]   That's modifying the image.
[00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:14.500]   And I don't know if that-- just like all other journalistic ethics, I don't know if anybody
[00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:16.820]   even-- I mean, do they teach that anymore even?
[00:53:16.820 --> 00:53:19.300]   I don't know if that's gone by the white side.
[00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:20.300]   Ethics.
[00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:22.060]   That's how it plays in place, North of Kent.
[00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:23.060]   Yes.
[00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:29.020]   I honestly think-- partly it's because of the internet and competition.
[00:53:29.020 --> 00:53:32.100]   At this point, getting the clicks is only really matters.
[00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:35.740]   And I'm talking to two guys who make their living publishing on the net.
[00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:37.140]   Tell me I'm wrong.
[00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:38.140]   I wish I could.
[00:53:38.140 --> 00:53:39.300]   I really wish I could.
[00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:44.860]   By the way, you're starting to see this effect in video, in cinematography.
[00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:50.980]   They introduced a process a couple of years ago called ACES, which is a way to make closer
[00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:54.180]   to what your eye can actually see what's being displayed on film.
[00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:58.260]   Because a standard-- a good camera can display 11 stops of contrast.
[00:53:58.260 --> 00:53:59.780]   Your eye can see 14.
[00:53:59.780 --> 00:54:03.580]   So you can't see the extreme low or the extreme high on film.
[00:54:03.580 --> 00:54:08.180]   ACES actually allows you to put really, really bright and really, really dark.
[00:54:08.180 --> 00:54:12.940]   But it also means that what you're seeing on film wasn't actually filmed.
[00:54:12.940 --> 00:54:15.100]   It was computed later on.
[00:54:15.100 --> 00:54:16.100]   That's not new, though.
[00:54:16.100 --> 00:54:20.540]   I mean, the dirty little secret of movies is that they can retouch actors and actresses
[00:54:20.540 --> 00:54:21.900]   to look more beautiful.
[00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:24.140]   They often routinely do.
[00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:28.500]   That creates an issue, too, because we compare ourselves to the images on the screen, whether
[00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:30.580]   it's Instagram or on the movie screen.
[00:54:30.580 --> 00:54:34.020]   If we can't live up to those fake images, we feel inadequate.
[00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:38.020]   This is why here on Twitch, we do not retouch.
[00:54:38.020 --> 00:54:39.460]   We don't try.
[00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:40.460]   We don't even use makeup.
[00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:43.340]   Actually, I am an HDR right now.
[00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:44.660]   You do look tremendous.
[00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:46.340]   I think the rest of us could use a little bit of help.
[00:54:46.340 --> 00:54:51.620]   Well, this is also why, I mean, the most genuine representation of cinema was the Battle
[00:54:51.620 --> 00:54:55.460]   of Winter at Winterfell in Game of Thrones season eight.
[00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:56.460]   Complete dark-- the dark one.
[00:54:56.460 --> 00:54:57.460]   Oh, no.
[00:54:57.460 --> 00:54:59.580]   That was a terrible scene.
[00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:01.580]   I'm still mad about the entire season.
[00:55:01.580 --> 00:55:04.780]   I honestly thought there was something wrong with either me or my TV when I was--
[00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:05.780]   I thought I could use a--
[00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:07.940]   I thought if you had a good TV and a good signal, you could probably see it.
[00:55:07.940 --> 00:55:10.900]   If you had an HDR TV and a carrier that was actually providing you--
[00:55:10.900 --> 00:55:13.700]   The problem is, Comcast wasn't streaming in high enough quality.
[00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:14.700]   No.
[00:55:14.700 --> 00:55:16.660]   So you couldn't really tell, even if you had an HDR TV.
[00:55:16.660 --> 00:55:20.740]   I have seen every season in Game of Thrones at least three times, except for season eight,
[00:55:20.740 --> 00:55:21.740]   which is--
[00:55:21.740 --> 00:55:22.900]   Why is it because you never wanted to end?
[00:55:22.900 --> 00:55:24.700]   No, I just-- and did it correctly.
[00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:27.660]   I don't mind-- if I go on an airplane, I want there to be a landing.
[00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:29.300]   In this case, it was a show that ended in a crash.
[00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:33.540]   Well, George RR Mike crashed basically confirmed that's not how he's ending the suit.
[00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:34.540]   Oh, really?
[00:55:34.540 --> 00:55:35.540]   Brand's knocking me king.
[00:55:35.540 --> 00:55:36.540]   Hey, it is.
[00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:37.540]   Boy, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:38.540]   He was joking.
[00:55:38.540 --> 00:55:39.540]   He was joking.
[00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:40.540]   That's crazy talk.
[00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:41.540]   That couldn't happen.
[00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:42.540]   Yeah, that was stupid on the show.
[00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:43.540]   Sorry, I have to rail this.
[00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:44.540]   We just ticked off a bunch of people.
[00:55:44.540 --> 00:55:45.540]   No.
[00:55:45.540 --> 00:55:46.540]   If you haven't watched it by now, you're never going to watch it.
[00:55:46.540 --> 00:55:48.540]   I showed a bunch of Game of Thrones when I was in college.
[00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:57.140]   It's just getting to Rome now.
[00:55:57.140 --> 00:55:58.140]   What?
[00:55:58.140 --> 00:55:59.140]   Yeah.
[00:55:59.140 --> 00:56:00.140]   We get things real quick.
[00:56:00.140 --> 00:56:01.140]   Does Rome watch?
[00:56:01.140 --> 00:56:02.140]   No.
[00:56:02.140 --> 00:56:03.820]   I think we're good.
[00:56:03.820 --> 00:56:06.860]   I want to-- so I can't say anything.
[00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:12.140]   Let's just say it's best left and I think there is some merit to the petition to get
[00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:15.220]   the entire season re-short by somebody who knows how they do it.
[00:56:15.220 --> 00:56:16.220]   No, there's no merit to that.
[00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:17.220]   Phone's.
[00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:18.220]   It's only my phone's.
[00:56:18.220 --> 00:56:19.220]   No merit to that.
[00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:22.860]   That's what it's at whatsoever.
[00:56:22.860 --> 00:56:24.340]   It's not going to be remade, but I think you're right.
[00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:27.340]   I think George RR Martin has said, "Well, I'm going to end it my way."
[00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:29.060]   Yeah, when it finally gets round to it.
[00:56:29.060 --> 00:56:30.060]   I'm sorry.
[00:56:30.060 --> 00:56:31.060]   I'm never going to finish it.
[00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:32.060]   I've got two whole books to do.
[00:56:32.060 --> 00:56:33.540]   Writer's book is a thing and I know it.
[00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:34.540]   I've experimented to myself.
[00:56:34.540 --> 00:56:35.540]   He said-- but for this long--
[00:56:35.540 --> 00:56:40.820]   In a recent interview, he said, "Well, the TV show was really a problem because I would
[00:56:40.820 --> 00:56:44.020]   watch that and then I would think, 'Oh, I've really got to get writing.'
[00:56:44.020 --> 00:56:45.980]   And he said, 'It's not enough to write four pages.
[00:56:45.980 --> 00:56:48.540]   I got to write 40 pages, but I can't.'
[00:56:48.540 --> 00:56:52.700]   And so I think he felt there was increasing pressure on him.
[00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:53.900]   He's not in the greatest of health.
[00:56:53.900 --> 00:56:54.900]   I--
[00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:55.900]   No.
[00:56:55.900 --> 00:56:56.900]   This is the bit that he does.
[00:56:56.900 --> 00:56:59.140]   I think we have the completed set and I'm sorry.
[00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:03.940]   He estimated that he needs at least 15 more starts to kill to destroy that.
[00:57:03.940 --> 00:57:05.700]   I think I'll make some more starts.
[00:57:05.700 --> 00:57:06.700]   He doesn't have that many starts.
[00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:09.100]   We need more stocks.
[00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:11.380]   Our show today brought to you by Roman.
[00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:13.180]   I think this is a great company.
[00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:16.540]   You've seen the ads on TV where there's the father and the son.
[00:57:16.540 --> 00:57:20.460]   It's just I find it so inspiring.
[00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:25.460]   Guys, look, the story on the TV ad is the son was ill and his father was a doctor.
[00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:29.460]   Fortunately, his father was able to diagnose him, but the problem is we guys are awful
[00:57:29.460 --> 00:57:33.820]   at taking care of our health because what are we taught in little league, right?
[00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:38.100]   Just rub some dirt on it and get back in the game.
[00:57:38.100 --> 00:57:39.100]   Yeah.
[00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:43.140]   And so whether it's an injury or a bad back or something more, guys just are more comfortable
[00:57:43.140 --> 00:57:44.660]   letting it go.
[00:57:44.660 --> 00:57:49.860]   And if it weren't for my wife, I probably would never go to the doctor, right?
[00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:51.260]   But she says, 'Go to the doctor.
[00:57:51.260 --> 00:57:52.500]   Go to the doctor.'
[00:57:52.500 --> 00:57:56.700]   There is one condition that even if you go to the doctor, it's hard to talk about, of
[00:57:56.700 --> 00:57:58.220]   course, ED.
[00:57:58.220 --> 00:58:05.020]   70% of the guys who suffer from ED and suffers the word don't get treated for it.
[00:58:05.020 --> 00:58:06.180]   They just don't want to talk about it.
[00:58:06.180 --> 00:58:07.860]   It's embarrassing.
[00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:09.380]   Roman is a brilliant company.
[00:58:09.380 --> 00:58:14.100]   They don't just do ED, but we could focus on ED that will connect you with a licensed
[00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:16.180]   doctor in your state.
[00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:23.220]   So a state licensed doctor online, they will give you a checkup and effect online checkup
[00:58:23.220 --> 00:58:25.420]   in the comfort and privacy of your own home.
[00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:26.500]   You can talk to them.
[00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:30.380]   It's a little easier because it's online.
[00:58:30.380 --> 00:58:34.340]   And then if the doctor decides treatment is appropriate, very important, they can prescribe
[00:58:34.340 --> 00:58:40.260]   genuine medication, not something with sawdust.
[00:58:40.260 --> 00:58:42.740]   You wouldn't believe some of the stuff you get from overseas.
[00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:47.060]   This is the real stuff that can be delivered in discrete packaging right to your door with
[00:58:47.060 --> 00:58:48.060]   free two-day shipping.
[00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:52.420]   In fact, we're going to even set it up so that the visit is free as well, no charge for
[00:58:52.420 --> 00:58:54.900]   the initial medical visit.
[00:58:54.900 --> 00:58:55.940]   It's confidential.
[00:58:55.940 --> 00:58:56.940]   It's online.
[00:58:56.940 --> 00:58:57.940]   It's easy.
[00:58:57.940 --> 00:59:04.780]   Guys, I know it's something nobody wants to talk about, but you can go to the doctor.
[00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:05.780]   Tackle ED.
[00:59:05.780 --> 00:59:06.780]   There's no shame in it.
[00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:10.820]   It happens to guys of all ages, but it is important to get it checked out because it
[00:59:10.820 --> 00:59:13.300]   can be an underlying other problem as well.
[00:59:13.300 --> 00:59:15.540]   And you don't want to suffer from it.
[00:59:15.540 --> 00:59:20.140]   With Roman, it's easy to connect with the doctor for free and an online visit, but you
[00:59:20.140 --> 00:59:24.540]   got to go through our address because normally I think they charge you for that initial visit.
[00:59:24.540 --> 00:59:26.540]   GetRoman.com/twit.
[00:59:26.540 --> 00:59:29.500]   That's the address and two-day shipping for free.
[00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:31.460]   GetRoman.com/twit.
[00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:37.540]   Look, you don't have to say anything.
[00:59:37.540 --> 00:59:38.860]   Mums the word.
[00:59:38.860 --> 00:59:40.900]   You can one guy to another.
[00:59:40.900 --> 00:59:46.300]   Or if you've got a guy in your life and you know there's a problem, you tell him about
[00:59:46.300 --> 00:59:47.300]   it.
[00:59:47.300 --> 00:59:50.220]   GetRoman.com/twit.
[00:59:50.220 --> 00:59:55.380]   So notably, this company has a parent company of sorts called Rho, which has three different
[00:59:55.380 --> 00:59:57.580]   brands of which Roman is now one of them.
[00:59:57.580 --> 00:59:59.500]   And they've raised like 170 million dollars.
[00:59:59.500 --> 01:00:01.300]   Because it turns out it's not just ED.
[01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:03.180]   There's hair loss.
[01:00:03.180 --> 01:00:04.620]   There's other things that are going on.
[01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:06.580]   And guys are so bad.
[01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:07.820]   We just suffer in silence.
[01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:08.820]   We just taught it not.
[01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:09.820]   It's not a pro...
[01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:11.580]   You know, so I think this is a good thing.
[01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:12.580]   I'm all for it.
[01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:13.820]   I have no problem with it at all.
[01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:15.060]   Telemedicine is a general principle.
[01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:16.060]   It's pretty cool.
[01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:17.060]   Yeah.
[01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:18.380]   I mean, some things you got to go to the doctor for, but not.
[01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:19.380]   This is not one of them.
[01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:20.380]   If your arm falls off.
[01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:21.380]   Yes.
[01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:22.620]   If your arm falls off, go to the doctor.
[01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:24.100]   If you've got a flying cow, go to the doctor.
[01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:27.580]   I was saying reports that in fact, ED is much more common now in young people than
[01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:28.580]   I ever was.
[01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:29.580]   It is.
[01:00:29.580 --> 01:00:30.580]   And they're...
[01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:31.580]   Why?
[01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:32.580]   I don't know.
[01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:33.580]   It's just a thing.
[01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:34.580]   I have theories, but I don't know if it's appropriate for this show.
[01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:35.580]   Oh, okay.
[01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:36.580]   Okay.
[01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:38.580]   I want to hear these theories.
[01:00:38.580 --> 01:00:43.580]   We have to show that eyeball licking and stuff that I guess they do.
[01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:44.580]   What?
[01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:46.220]   The kids today, they lick their eyeballs.
[01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:47.220]   You haven't heard?
[01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:48.580]   No, he's making that up.
[01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:49.580]   Or...
[01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:50.580]   Actually, no, I'm not.
[01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:52.580]   Or there's more going on in the Vatican than we thought.
[01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:53.580]   Oh!
[01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:54.580]   No!
[01:00:54.580 --> 01:00:55.580]   I think...
[01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:57.660]   It's different to be a kid today.
[01:00:57.660 --> 01:01:00.900]   I noticed my kids, they don't date.
[01:01:00.900 --> 01:01:01.900]   They hang out in groups.
[01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:05.540]   I think, honestly, internet pornography, the easy access to pornography, has been...
[01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:06.540]   It's completely changed.
[01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:07.820]   Now, you're pretty young, Alex.
[01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:10.660]   So you might have impacted you as well.
[01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:11.660]   But I...
[01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:12.660]   That's quite a lot.
[01:01:12.660 --> 01:01:13.660]   That's dated uncomfortable.
[01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:18.300]   I was trying to think about how to respond, but from what I was actually speechless.
[01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:20.260]   Alex.exe has stopped responding.
[01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:26.700]   But I honestly think that there is a whole different relationship to sexuality with people
[01:01:26.700 --> 01:01:31.100]   under, say, 25 or with the generation that grew up with the internet.
[01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:32.500]   And it's not a healthy relationship.
[01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:33.700]   I would have been that just gently.
[01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:35.700]   I think millennials are now up to 40.
[01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:36.700]   So I think it's by James.
[01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:38.620]   No, you know what I found out?
[01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:41.700]   You're a millennial if you're Mark Zuckerberg's age or younger.
[01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:42.700]   He's 36.
[01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:44.260]   Okay, well, I'm definitely in that...
[01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:45.260]   You're a millennial.
[01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:48.540]   But it might be pre-millennial because my kids are okay.
[01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:49.820]   But the younger kid...
[01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:51.420]   You know, he's 16.
[01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:52.420]   No dating.
[01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:53.420]   Doesn't...
[01:01:53.420 --> 01:01:54.420]   You know, it's just...
[01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:55.580]   Well, I think none of his friends, they all hang out.
[01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:56.580]   But it's just not...
[01:01:56.580 --> 01:01:57.860]   And if there are girls as there, sometimes...
[01:01:57.860 --> 01:02:00.100]   Actually, my son is kind of in this boat too.
[01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:02.020]   They'll hang out with girls.
[01:02:02.020 --> 01:02:04.740]   But it's not like, in my day...
[01:02:04.740 --> 01:02:05.740]   Yes.
[01:02:05.740 --> 01:02:06.740]   You would date.
[01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:07.740]   Yes.
[01:02:07.740 --> 01:02:08.740]   But back then we would have a steady...
[01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:10.820]   Yeah, but you could go out and do things as a kid back then.
[01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:12.460]   You were kicked out of the house and told to go explore.
[01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:14.180]   And now you stay in your room.
[01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:15.180]   Yeah.
[01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:17.660]   Well, also parents don't let their children have nearly as much autonomous as they used
[01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:18.660]   to.
[01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:19.660]   That's right.
[01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:20.660]   So it could be that.
[01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:21.660]   It could be stranger danger.
[01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:24.180]   I just read a book about parenting styles around the world and how people in different
[01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:25.180]   countries parent differently.
[01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:29.380]   And usually, if it's a country with a lot of economic competition, parents tend to be
[01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:32.740]   much more involved and almost oppressive to their children because they're worried
[01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:36.900]   and countries where economics anxieties less prevalent, Sweden and so forth, there's
[01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:39.220]   a much more relaxed childhood effect.
[01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:40.660]   Well, thank goodness.
[01:02:40.660 --> 01:02:43.460]   Apple's introducing Apple Arcade for just $5 a month.
[01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:45.460]   So you never need to leave the house.
[01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:47.660]   It's cheaper than dating, apparently.
[01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:49.140]   What to say that...
[01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:51.660]   When we talk about millennials, we're actually talking about a fundamental change in the
[01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:52.660]   way that people make relationships.
[01:02:52.660 --> 01:02:53.660]   Yes.
[01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:54.660]   That's what I think.
[01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:55.660]   Yeah.
[01:02:55.660 --> 01:02:56.660]   Well, that's what I think.
[01:02:56.660 --> 01:02:59.860]   Because there's a paper in the National Academy of Sciences.
[01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:03.540]   Online is now the majority of Americans downbeat online.
[01:03:03.540 --> 01:03:04.540]   Of course.
[01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:05.540]   As opposed to meeting in the house.
[01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:09.020]   So you meet online, you date online, you get at your ED medicine online.
[01:03:09.020 --> 01:03:10.820]   There's only one thing missing here.
[01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:11.820]   Human connection.
[01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:12.820]   Touching somebody.
[01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:13.820]   Yeah.
[01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:14.820]   Being in the same place.
[01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:16.380]   But do you really want to do that?
[01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:17.380]   No.
[01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:18.380]   I mean, that's a lot of time.
[01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:19.380]   You've done exactly the expil.
[01:03:19.380 --> 01:03:23.420]   This opens an opportunity though for anyone who wants to host people at their house because
[01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:24.780]   people don't do this as much as they used to.
[01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:26.740]   So if you do, everyone's really excited about it.
[01:03:26.740 --> 01:03:30.020]   There's an open dinner party window now in our culture.
[01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:31.740]   It's actually genuine.
[01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:35.100]   To make sure Michael does have a social life, we have 16 year old boys, all his friends
[01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:36.260]   come over every Friday night.
[01:03:36.260 --> 01:03:37.260]   We have pizza.
[01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:38.740]   They play video games.
[01:03:38.740 --> 01:03:42.500]   We now have three VR systems.
[01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:45.500]   So that they don't actually have to look at each other while they're playing video games.
[01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:46.500]   That would be too much.
[01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:47.500]   That would be too much.
[01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:48.500]   And then this is weird.
[01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:49.500]   I've talked to other parents.
[01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:52.940]   Then after the night's over, they all go home and get back online, play with each other
[01:03:52.940 --> 01:03:53.940]   online.
[01:03:53.940 --> 01:03:54.940]   That is weird.
[01:03:54.940 --> 01:03:57.260]   They're talking to each other.
[01:03:57.260 --> 01:04:00.460]   They're in the social environment, but each of them is there in their own home.
[01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:02.500]   It's safer though, because when I was young, we didn't have that.
[01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:05.500]   We had guns and paintball guns, which we just took out into the woods.
[01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:06.500]   I had land parties.
[01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:11.660]   Yeah, sometimes I had land parties and napalm.
[01:04:11.660 --> 01:04:13.420]   I was basically kicked out.
[01:04:13.420 --> 01:04:16.020]   Mum gave me a watch and said, right, you don't lose that watch.
[01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:17.020]   You back at 5pm.
[01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:18.620]   Otherwise I come out looking for you.
[01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:20.620]   Because she had no way to reach you by cell phones.
[01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:21.620]   No cell phone.
[01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:23.620]   Those are the good days.
[01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:24.620]   Yeah.
[01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:25.620]   I think you may be...
[01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:26.620]   You're sounding like a bunch of old farts now.
[01:04:26.620 --> 01:04:28.220]   Yeah, but see, we did this.
[01:04:28.220 --> 01:04:29.380]   Thank God you're here, Alex.
[01:04:29.380 --> 01:04:33.140]   We underestimated the kind of connection that people could make with someone that they've
[01:04:33.140 --> 01:04:34.140]   never met.
[01:04:34.140 --> 01:04:36.740]   We thought, oh, that's all, that's superficial.
[01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:38.180]   It's not a real relationship.
[01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:39.180]   When it is...
[01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:45.300]   If I want to be honest, some of these relationships are more trusting and on a deeper level than
[01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:48.820]   people who have known each other and been with each other for a decade.
[01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:51.500]   Here's where the difference lies.
[01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:55.140]   There's very little friction in an online relationship.
[01:04:55.140 --> 01:04:59.620]   If there is, it's too easy to go, just sign out and come back the next day.
[01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:04.260]   You don't have the challenges in an online relationship that you have in a real-world
[01:05:04.260 --> 01:05:05.260]   relationship.
[01:05:05.260 --> 01:05:06.260]   Are they different?
[01:05:06.260 --> 01:05:07.260]   Because they're different.
[01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:08.740]   Maybe you have a little flame...
[01:05:08.740 --> 01:05:13.900]   If I talk to two people who have been, say, working in the same place for the last decade,
[01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:16.180]   and I start asking things like, well, what's his favorite food?
[01:05:16.180 --> 01:05:17.580]   Or what's her favorite kind of movie?
[01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:18.580]   Or what's her favorite book?
[01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:19.580]   They may not know.
[01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:20.580]   They may not know.
[01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:24.780]   Even in an online relationship for 10 years, they know all that stuff.
[01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:28.420]   Or at least they know what the other person wanted them to know about them.
[01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:31.940]   It's because those relationships are more based on communication itself as opposed to
[01:05:31.940 --> 01:05:33.740]   being in physical proximity.
[01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:36.020]   There's a higher level of throughput of information.
[01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:38.460]   But don't you think physical touch is important?
[01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:39.460]   Huge fan.
[01:05:39.460 --> 01:05:40.460]   Huge fan.
[01:05:40.460 --> 01:05:41.460]   I like cuddly.
[01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:42.460]   I like being hugged.
[01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:43.460]   No, I think it's important.
[01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:44.460]   Yes.
[01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:45.460]   I think we're human beings.
[01:05:45.460 --> 01:05:46.460]   That's what we need.
[01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:47.700]   That's very important.
[01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:48.700]   I really need.
[01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:49.700]   It makes me...
[01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:50.700]   Hugging a day.
[01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:51.700]   I just feel really sad.
[01:05:51.700 --> 01:05:52.700]   Oh, I'll pause.
[01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:53.700]   I need to...
[01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:54.700]   It's okay.
[01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:55.700]   Depress hug one another.
[01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:56.700]   Of course they do.
[01:05:56.700 --> 01:05:57.700]   Of course.
[01:05:57.700 --> 01:05:59.980]   And they go Paxful Biscum and all of that, right?
[01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:00.980]   I missed the bus.
[01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:01.980]   You missed the bus.
[01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:02.980]   When's the next bus?
[01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:05.060]   You haven't heard that?
[01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:06.060]   That's how you learn that.
[01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:07.780]   That's what Johnny Dangerously, I'm sorry.
[01:06:07.780 --> 01:06:09.780]   I learned that.
[01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:14.420]   Somebody told me that you don't say God would go with you and you also.
[01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:15.780]   There's a new phrase on you.
[01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:21.580]   Yeah, so the old English translation was "May the Lord be with you and also with you."
[01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:25.460]   And the new one is "Yo, dude."
[01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:26.460]   No.
[01:06:26.460 --> 01:06:27.460]   "May the Lord be with you."
[01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:28.460]   Actually, that's awesome.
[01:06:28.460 --> 01:06:29.460]   That doesn't change more.
[01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:30.780]   And with your spirit.
[01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:31.780]   And with your spirit.
[01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:32.780]   That's new.
[01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:33.780]   That's right.
[01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:34.780]   What was the first half?
[01:06:34.780 --> 01:06:36.780]   "May the Lord be with you and with your spirit."
[01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:38.700]   I'm going to do a Biscum.
[01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:40.420]   It's actually a more faithful translation.
[01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:43.780]   It's just very alien to anyone who grew up for 40 years.
[01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:44.780]   Somebody told me it's different.
[01:06:44.780 --> 01:06:45.780]   Because they said you're at your heart.
[01:06:45.780 --> 01:06:46.780]   It's hard.
[01:06:46.780 --> 01:06:47.780]   It's hard to do it that way.
[01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:50.780]   I can't do it without reading it because I always default back to the old way of doing
[01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:51.780]   it.
[01:06:51.780 --> 01:06:53.020]   I kind of like the old way doing it.
[01:06:53.020 --> 01:06:54.020]   It was like Namaste.
[01:06:54.020 --> 01:06:55.020]   Kind of.
[01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:58.660]   Yeah, I recognize the God in me, recognize the God in you kind of.
[01:06:58.660 --> 01:07:03.820]   John Mulaney does a whole thing on this as a lapsed Catholic of how he comes back to
[01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:05.700]   the church years later.
[01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:07.740]   And he's like, "They changed everything."
[01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:08.740]   "They changed everything."
[01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:09.740]   I memorize all these things.
[01:07:09.740 --> 01:07:10.740]   And it's all different.
[01:07:10.740 --> 01:07:12.740]   It's a millennial old tradition.
[01:07:12.740 --> 01:07:15.460]   You're not supposed to be changing it every few years.
[01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:17.460]   What's wrong?
[01:07:17.460 --> 01:07:18.460]   Arcade.
[01:07:18.460 --> 01:07:21.940]   We don't know the actual price, but the rumor, and it's a good rumor because it's a german
[01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:22.940]   rumor.
[01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:24.820]   German rumors are good rumors.
[01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:26.100]   $4.99 a month.
[01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:27.580]   I like that.
[01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:28.660]   A hundred games.
[01:07:28.660 --> 01:07:30.180]   They change regularly.
[01:07:30.180 --> 01:07:31.180]   Five bucks a month.
[01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:32.180]   I would do that.
[01:07:32.180 --> 01:07:33.180]   Do I need another subscription?
[01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:34.380]   Well, this is the problem.
[01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:37.980]   Do you need Disney Plus or Apple TV Plus or?
[01:07:37.980 --> 01:07:40.180]   There are a lot of new subscriptions on their way.
[01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:43.460]   So you're not going to buy Disney Plus or Apple TV?
[01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:46.300]   I'm discontinuing both Amazon Prime and Netflix.
[01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:47.300]   I don't sell that price.
[01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:49.740]   That's all done with the subscription model.
[01:07:49.740 --> 01:07:51.740]   I'm just going to steal everything.
[01:07:51.740 --> 01:07:52.740]   Oh, okay.
[01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:53.740]   You're a priest.
[01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:54.740]   You're a laddie.
[01:07:54.740 --> 01:07:55.740]   It's in the commandments.
[01:07:55.740 --> 01:07:56.740]   It's not a compliment.
[01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:57.740]   It's not a compliment.
[01:07:57.740 --> 01:08:01.140]   Are you not sure that Netflix password?
[01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:04.220]   Who here is going to get Disney Plus streaming service?
[01:08:04.220 --> 01:08:05.220]   No.
[01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:07.020]   I don't care that much about Marvel.
[01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:08.020]   Michael in the back's going, yes.
[01:08:08.020 --> 01:08:11.180]   I mean, why Carson wants to get?
[01:08:11.180 --> 01:08:12.180]   Why Carson?
[01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:13.180]   Star Trek?
[01:08:13.180 --> 01:08:14.180]   Star Wars.
[01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:15.180]   Star Wars.
[01:08:15.180 --> 01:08:16.180]   And Disney.
[01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:17.580]   I was married in Disney World.
[01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:18.580]   So.
[01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:19.580]   Oh, that's disgusting.
[01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:20.580]   No.
[01:08:20.580 --> 01:08:21.580]   Come on.
[01:08:21.580 --> 01:08:26.420]   It's not like he's wearing a Mickey Mouse hat in the Gimmus.
[01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:27.420]   What?
[01:08:27.420 --> 01:08:28.620]   They did it on the Mad Hatter ride?
[01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:31.940]   I'm not sure he wasn't wearing a Mickey Mouse hat during that.
[01:08:31.940 --> 01:08:33.860]   Were you wearing any Disney paraphernalia?
[01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:37.620]   Top hat to the rehearsal dinner.
[01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:40.100]   Oh, all right.
[01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:46.580]   I just don't like this idea of we cut the cord to avoid this sort of bundling.
[01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:47.580]   And now we have to do it again.
[01:08:47.580 --> 01:08:48.580]   Where'd it come in?
[01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:53.220]   Well, and I think Ben Thompson's talked about this aggregation, then disaggregation, bundling,
[01:08:53.220 --> 01:08:54.220]   then dis bundling.
[01:08:54.220 --> 01:08:55.420]   It seems to be a cycle.
[01:08:55.420 --> 01:08:56.420]   Yep.
[01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:57.420]   All of tech is either bundling or un-bundling.
[01:08:57.420 --> 01:09:00.820]   And it's been a running joke since I started covering tech.
[01:09:00.820 --> 01:09:02.500]   Anytime a new software product.
[01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:05.700]   But like the Big Bang, is it like the universe expanding, contracting, expanding.
[01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:07.140]   Yeah, Big Bang, big crunch.
[01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:11.020]   Except there's been just one big differentiator between how this has been happening in years
[01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:12.020]   past.
[01:09:12.020 --> 01:09:16.660]   And that is with the additional vertical integrations where the distributor is also the content
[01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:20.980]   creator, I don't see that becoming unbundled anytime in the near future.
[01:09:20.980 --> 01:09:23.340]   It's not like someone's going to offer them a better deal for their content.
[01:09:23.340 --> 01:09:24.700]   But we had that with Netflix.
[01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:26.380]   They had friends and other shows on it.
[01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:28.020]   And now that's been torn away.
[01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:29.020]   Yeah.
[01:09:29.020 --> 01:09:30.020]   Here's the thing.
[01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:31.020]   I don't care about those two shows.
[01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:33.060]   I don't feel the need to go anywhere else.
[01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:36.340]   But what if there were a show you did care about and now suddenly it's on another channel
[01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:39.700]   and it's going to cost you 10 bucks a month for that one?
[01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:43.020]   There's going to be, I think there theory is, there's going to be a show.
[01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:45.460]   And for some people it is Star Wars or the Marvel Comic Universe.
[01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:47.020]   For some people it is an un-mister.
[01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:49.940]   It's the office or friends.
[01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:52.780]   And I think that for some percentage of people it is.
[01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:56.540]   But nobody wants to have $10 here, $10 there, $10 there, $10 there.
[01:09:56.540 --> 01:09:57.540]   It just gets to be crazy.
[01:09:57.540 --> 01:10:00.340]   But you're the first person I've heard say, I'm going to give up Netflix.
[01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:04.140]   So I feel like Netflix is the default, like I will have some stuff to watch on my various
[01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:05.140]   screens.
[01:10:05.140 --> 01:10:08.420]   I only have Netflix for two or three months out of the year.
[01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:11.180]   Because that's about how much time it takes me to binge through whatever they've added.
[01:10:11.180 --> 01:10:12.620]   And then I dump it.
[01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:13.860]   I don't need it after that.
[01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:18.340]   They are spending $14 billion this year on new content.
[01:10:18.340 --> 01:10:21.140]   I can't wait for the next 10 Adam Sandler films.
[01:10:21.140 --> 01:10:22.140]   Yeah.
[01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:23.140]   That was a waste.
[01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:24.140]   I admit it.
[01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:28.580]   Although you know what the most watched Netflix film of all time is?
[01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:29.580]   Was it an Adam Sandler film?
[01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:31.980]   Was that an Adam Sandler movie?
[01:10:31.980 --> 01:10:33.180]   Wait, the hateful eight?
[01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:34.580]   No, what was the one?
[01:10:34.580 --> 01:10:35.580]   This is how civilization.
[01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:36.580]   No, not the hateful eight.
[01:10:36.580 --> 01:10:37.580]   You did it, Jennifer Addison.
[01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:38.580]   I love it, you know.
[01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:40.820]   What was the name of that?
[01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:41.980]   My wife watched it.
[01:10:41.980 --> 01:10:42.980]   I said, was it good?
[01:10:42.980 --> 01:10:45.900]   And she said it's called murder mystery.
[01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:48.300]   She said it was okay.
[01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:49.300]   But she watched it.
[01:10:49.300 --> 01:10:54.420]   And apparently more people watched murder mystery in the first week than any other Netflix
[01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:55.420]   original in history.
[01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:56.420]   That's great.
[01:10:56.420 --> 01:10:58.340]   I mean, that's a condemnation of our taste.
[01:10:58.340 --> 01:10:59.340]   Yeah.
[01:10:59.340 --> 01:11:00.700]   We're just saying it works.
[01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:01.700]   It works.
[01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:02.940]   Love sex and robots.
[01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:03.940]   Is that what it's called?
[01:11:03.940 --> 01:11:05.700]   Love death and robots or something?
[01:11:05.700 --> 01:11:06.700]   Okay.
[01:11:06.700 --> 01:11:08.980]   It's actually an anthology series.
[01:11:08.980 --> 01:11:10.900]   You get many different types of that.
[01:11:10.900 --> 01:11:13.900]   There's a couple of them that are really watched like a 13.
[01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:18.580]   I mean, it's a Formula One note that the need for speed one they did is I would actually
[01:11:18.580 --> 01:11:20.940]   consider signing up for a month for just a binge.
[01:11:20.940 --> 01:11:21.940]   Oh, it's very good.
[01:11:21.940 --> 01:11:23.740]   All we talked about in the way of today was this.
[01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:24.740]   It was fantastic.
[01:11:24.740 --> 01:11:28.860]   I mean, it's all the stuff I want the sky to be covering when they're doing those raises.
[01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:29.860]   Exactly.
[01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:33.380]   Said that the murder mystery at the biggest opening weekend of any Netflix film drawing
[01:11:33.380 --> 01:11:37.140]   more than 30 million views in its first three days.
[01:11:37.140 --> 01:11:38.140]   Could creep there.
[01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:39.300]   It's eight bucks a ticket.
[01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:41.820]   That's equivalent to like 240 mil at the box office.
[01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:42.820]   Wow.
[01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:46.660]   Of course, according to Mr. Spielberg, that should not be considered for any sort of
[01:11:46.660 --> 01:11:47.660]   award.
[01:11:47.660 --> 01:11:48.660]   Oh, no.
[01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:49.660]   There's a dinosaur.
[01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:50.660]   Yeah.
[01:11:50.660 --> 01:11:51.660]   Wait, I'm sorry.
[01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:52.660]   Wait, what service is Spielberg now?
[01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:53.660]   He's with Disney.
[01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:54.660]   Yes.
[01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:55.660]   No, he's with Apple.
[01:11:55.660 --> 01:11:56.660]   Yes.
[01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:57.660]   Yes.
[01:11:57.660 --> 01:11:58.660]   What was that?
[01:11:58.660 --> 01:12:03.860]   I'm a regular after condemning streaming stuff, but he's doing a streaming TV show.
[01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:05.580]   Oh, oh, so that's the difference.
[01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:06.580]   That's the difference.
[01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:10.140]   Well, I'm actually on the way to and way back from DEF CON.
[01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:14.620]   I watched his attempt to do a ready player one.
[01:12:14.620 --> 01:12:16.620]   And that was just ready player one.
[01:12:16.620 --> 01:12:19.580]   Oh, I thought it was a steaming pilot.
[01:12:19.580 --> 01:12:20.580]   Okay.
[01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:21.580]   I liked it.
[01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:22.580]   No way.
[01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:25.940]   So the people who don't have stickers in their computer liked it.
[01:12:25.940 --> 01:12:26.940]   Absolutely.
[01:12:26.940 --> 01:12:29.940]   I started by reading the book and the audio book.
[01:12:29.940 --> 01:12:33.380]   It was an excreble pile of crap.
[01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:34.380]   Okay, I love the book.
[01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:35.860]   The book was the worst book.
[01:12:35.860 --> 01:12:36.860]   I loved the book.
[01:12:36.860 --> 01:12:37.860]   It was so poorly written.
[01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:40.260]   And I earned his client as a nice guy.
[01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:43.420]   And I'm sure it was a, you know, he was his first novel.
[01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:44.740]   He never written another one.
[01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:45.740]   It didn't.
[01:12:45.740 --> 01:12:49.620]   It was badly written, full of cliches, full of cliches, full of cliches.
[01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:52.140]   It was a cliches, but it was also repetitive.
[01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:53.220]   There were lots of problems with it.
[01:12:53.220 --> 01:12:57.820]   I thought Spielberg took a kind of mediocre, not really terrible book, fun, fun to read,
[01:12:57.820 --> 01:13:01.940]   but a mediocre book and turned it into a pretty interesting movie by completely changing the
[01:13:01.940 --> 01:13:03.100]   plot.
[01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:04.380]   That's probably what drove me nuts.
[01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:05.980]   In fact, you wanted to hate it.
[01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:07.820]   I hate it when directors do that.
[01:13:07.820 --> 01:13:09.580]   That's like, book wasn't good.
[01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:13.020]   For me, that's like, I did not like the books.
[01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:14.380]   I really, I read all the books.
[01:13:14.380 --> 01:13:15.380]   I didn't like them.
[01:13:15.380 --> 01:13:16.380]   I liked the series.
[01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:17.380]   I love the series.
[01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:18.380]   Terrible.
[01:13:18.380 --> 01:13:19.380]   Clagger King's unreadable.
[01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:20.940]   There's all these hedge nights you've never heard of.
[01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:21.940]   And you put that in 80 pages.
[01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:22.940]   Who is this?
[01:13:22.940 --> 01:13:24.620]   That was like the same point of the show.
[01:13:24.620 --> 01:13:25.620]   The same point of the show.
[01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:26.620]   I don't need to know this.
[01:13:26.620 --> 01:13:30.020]   I did that in the TV show when they were, they had the, it was the beginning of the
[01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:31.020]   season.
[01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:34.740]   Some guy is being died and they were sending him off down the river and they shoot an
[01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:35.740]   arrow to light his thing.
[01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:37.340]   I said, who are these people?
[01:13:37.340 --> 01:13:38.340]   Who is this guy?
[01:13:38.340 --> 01:13:40.660]   I could remember.
[01:13:40.660 --> 01:13:42.340]   So that happened in the TV show too.
[01:13:42.340 --> 01:13:43.340]   That was crazy.
[01:13:43.340 --> 01:13:44.340]   I tried reading you.
[01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:45.340]   That was Blackfish.
[01:13:45.340 --> 01:13:46.340]   That was a Blackfish.
[01:13:46.340 --> 01:13:47.340]   Oh, Blackfish.
[01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:48.340]   I do love this entire Twitter, just things we don't like.
[01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:49.340]   That's what I was just talking about.
[01:13:49.340 --> 01:13:51.340]   And I got another thing I don't like.
[01:13:51.340 --> 01:13:52.340]   Get off!
[01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:55.140]   What about the Apple card?
[01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:58.940]   So I use the Apple card.
[01:13:58.940 --> 01:13:59.940]   Segway for these.
[01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:02.100]   But where do you keep your Apple card?
[01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:03.100]   That's the problem.
[01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:05.500]   So here's the deal with the Apple card.
[01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:08.500]   It was announced at WWDC in June.
[01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:09.500]   It's finally out.
[01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:12.500]   Everybody can get their Apple card.
[01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:15.340]   Now the Apple card really is just a way for Apple to push services.
[01:14:15.340 --> 01:14:18.300]   They're just trying to make more money per customer because they can't sell more iPhones.
[01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:20.780]   So they want to push Apple pay.
[01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:25.100]   When you get 2% back, if you use Apple pay, you get 1% only if you use just the credit
[01:14:25.100 --> 01:14:26.100]   card.
[01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:27.740]   You get 3% if you use it to buy something.
[01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:29.620]   But here's the deal with the Apple card.
[01:14:29.620 --> 01:14:30.700]   A couple of things.
[01:14:30.700 --> 01:14:32.300]   Here's John's Apple card.
[01:14:32.300 --> 01:14:36.780]   So John is keeping it in the sheath because Apple says...
[01:14:36.780 --> 01:14:37.780]   That's convenient.
[01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:42.020]   Do not put your Apple card next to leather.
[01:14:42.020 --> 01:14:43.020]   What's your wallet made out of?
[01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:44.020]   One second.
[01:14:44.020 --> 01:14:45.020]   Next to leather.
[01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:46.020]   Leather.
[01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:48.220]   Do not put your Apple card next to denim.
[01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:49.220]   Oh, it was...
[01:14:49.220 --> 01:14:50.220]   Yeah, leather.
[01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:51.220]   Leather.
[01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:54.700]   Yes, also do not put your Apple card next to other cards.
[01:14:54.700 --> 01:14:56.220]   And don't talk about it.
[01:14:56.220 --> 01:14:58.140]   Don't look at it.
[01:14:58.140 --> 01:15:00.260]   It's very sensitive.
[01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:01.260]   First rule of Apple card is...
[01:15:01.260 --> 01:15:02.260]   Don't call it fat.
[01:15:02.260 --> 01:15:07.100]   So the other thing that's a selling point in Apple card, I think Apple has really gone
[01:15:07.100 --> 01:15:08.100]   off the deep end.
[01:15:08.100 --> 01:15:09.100]   Is it a metal one as well?
[01:15:09.100 --> 01:15:10.100]   Yes, titanium.
[01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:12.380]   Oh, because that works so well with the centurion card.
[01:15:12.380 --> 01:15:17.700]   A friend of mine had a centurion card that Amex put out, the matte black titanium one
[01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:20.220]   that was supposedly so exclusive.
[01:15:20.220 --> 01:15:24.460]   And she said it's the worst thing ever because it's titanium, it's slightly too thick and
[01:15:24.460 --> 01:15:26.700]   it jams in readers left, right and centre.
[01:15:26.700 --> 01:15:28.700]   I've got a feeling that's going to go the same way.
[01:15:28.700 --> 01:15:29.700]   I have a new hobby.
[01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:32.540]   When all my friends show me their Apple card, I ask to see it and then I wipe it with a
[01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:33.540]   denim rag.
[01:15:33.540 --> 01:15:35.540]   I just hand it back.
[01:15:35.540 --> 01:15:36.540]   Breathe on it.
[01:15:36.540 --> 01:15:37.540]   Yeah.
[01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:40.540]   It remains to be seen if this, in fact, will get...
[01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:41.540]   I'm so good.
[01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:42.540]   Sorry, mate.
[01:15:42.540 --> 01:15:43.540]   That's it.
[01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:44.540]   It's gone.
[01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:45.540]   Done.
[01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:46.540]   Done.
[01:15:46.540 --> 01:15:47.540]   Done.
[01:15:47.540 --> 01:15:49.540]   Bring it to a genius bar.
[01:15:49.540 --> 01:15:51.540]   That was quite a clink.
[01:15:51.540 --> 01:15:54.060]   That was quite a clink.
[01:15:54.060 --> 01:15:56.980]   Can you really not pay your bill online if you have the Apple credit card?
[01:15:56.980 --> 01:15:57.980]   If you lose your phone.
[01:15:57.980 --> 01:15:58.980]   So you have to...
[01:15:58.980 --> 01:15:59.980]   It's all the phone.
[01:15:59.980 --> 01:16:03.020]   So just go buy another phone and you can pay for the phone.
[01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:05.940]   With the Apple card that you don't have, but now you can pay all the bills with the Apple
[01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:06.940]   card.
[01:16:06.940 --> 01:16:09.300]   I went out because one of the other things happens with the digital version on the phone
[01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:13.940]   and on the watch, is it turns colours when you buy stuff.
[01:16:13.940 --> 01:16:16.980]   My Apple card now looks like I've been storing it in a leather wallet.
[01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:19.380]   It's kind of a poop brown.
[01:16:19.380 --> 01:16:20.380]   When you call that?
[01:16:20.380 --> 01:16:21.380]   Yeah.
[01:16:21.380 --> 01:16:22.660]   That's not a good colour.
[01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:23.660]   That's not.
[01:16:23.660 --> 01:16:25.460]   I bought groceries and it turned poop brown.
[01:16:25.460 --> 01:16:27.540]   Wait, so what do the colours signify?
[01:16:27.540 --> 01:16:32.020]   The colours, if you buy entertainment, it's blue, right John?
[01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:33.020]   If you buy what else?
[01:16:33.020 --> 01:16:34.020]   What are the colours are there?
[01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:35.020]   You get colours.
[01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:39.380]   That's another thing that Apple people apparently like.
[01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:40.380]   I feel like...
[01:16:40.380 --> 01:16:41.380]   I'm not...
[01:16:41.380 --> 01:16:42.380]   This is like...
[01:16:42.380 --> 01:16:44.420]   I'm coming in late on a really weird cult.
[01:16:44.420 --> 01:16:45.420]   Yeah.
[01:16:45.420 --> 01:16:46.940]   And I just don't understand what's going on.
[01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:48.260]   So another thing I don't like.
[01:16:48.260 --> 01:16:50.820]   Well, I mean, this is one of the reds that we refer to.
[01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:53.660]   Some of these Apple products is the Cupidino Idiot's Axe.
[01:16:53.660 --> 01:16:54.660]   John's gonna kill you.
[01:16:54.660 --> 01:16:56.660]   I'm trying to break it.
[01:16:56.660 --> 01:16:57.660]   It's out of there.
[01:16:57.660 --> 01:16:58.660]   Can you reach that?
[01:16:58.660 --> 01:16:59.660]   I got it.
[01:16:59.660 --> 01:17:01.900]   No, no, no, no, put your shoes on it.
[01:17:01.900 --> 01:17:02.900]   Oh, you scotch.
[01:17:02.900 --> 01:17:04.900]   That was a nice card you had there, mate.
[01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:08.460]   You should have not handed that over.
[01:17:08.460 --> 01:17:09.460]   Don't...
[01:17:09.460 --> 01:17:11.460]   Here, let me have it.
[01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:14.740]   I won't take care of it, John.
[01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:17.060]   Talking about Ratchet and Clank.
[01:17:17.060 --> 01:17:19.020]   I mean, come on, seriously.
[01:17:19.020 --> 01:17:22.700]   Steve Jobs must be doing 45 revolutions per minute in his grave space.
[01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:23.700]   No, you know...
[01:17:23.700 --> 01:17:24.700]   Stuff like that, come out.
[01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:25.700]   This is BS.
[01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:31.860]   There's this mythological mythologizing of jobs like, "Oh, he held a highest standard."
[01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:33.620]   He was a very good salesman.
[01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:36.180]   No, no, no, I agree with you on that.
[01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:40.260]   He would be very happy to see how well the Apple card is just doing.
[01:17:40.260 --> 01:17:41.260]   I don't know.
[01:17:41.260 --> 01:17:42.420]   He did care about quality, though.
[01:17:42.420 --> 01:17:43.420]   He did.
[01:17:43.420 --> 01:17:44.420]   Premium, that's quality.
[01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:45.420]   Yeah, but he's not putting you up.
[01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:46.420]   So the colors are...
[01:17:46.420 --> 01:17:48.940]   Our entertainment is kind of blue-purple.
[01:17:48.940 --> 01:17:49.940]   Food and drinks.
[01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:50.940]   What color is that?
[01:17:50.940 --> 01:17:51.940]   Mustard?
[01:17:51.940 --> 01:17:53.540]   It's between brown and red.
[01:17:53.540 --> 01:17:58.100]   And shopping, which is what I did, is another kind of mustard.
[01:17:58.100 --> 01:18:01.060]   There's two browns and a magenta.
[01:18:01.060 --> 01:18:02.060]   The card feels nice.
[01:18:02.060 --> 01:18:03.060]   It's fine.
[01:18:03.060 --> 01:18:08.100]   Oh, by the way, if anyone would like to pick up a hobby, if you make a tiny little scratch
[01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:12.140]   in an Apple card and then put tap water on it from anywhere in the United States, it will
[01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:13.140]   start to dissolve.
[01:18:13.140 --> 01:18:18.300]   Because tap water in the United States is heavy in fluoride, which destroys titanium.
[01:18:18.300 --> 01:18:19.300]   No, really?
[01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:20.300]   It does.
[01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:22.300]   Oh, I will do that when I get my own cards.
[01:18:22.300 --> 01:18:23.300]   That is...
[01:18:23.300 --> 01:18:24.300]   Oh, no, wait a minute.
[01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:25.300]   We don't have fluoride in Petaloma.
[01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:26.300]   You don't?
[01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:27.300]   They took it out.
[01:18:27.300 --> 01:18:28.300]   They never put it in.
[01:18:28.300 --> 01:18:29.300]   Oh, wow.
[01:18:29.300 --> 01:18:30.300]   Okay.
[01:18:30.300 --> 01:18:31.300]   So this is actually...
[01:18:31.300 --> 01:18:32.300]   I explained to another story.
[01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:33.300]   I explained to another story.
[01:18:33.300 --> 01:18:34.300]   So gummy here.
[01:18:34.300 --> 01:18:35.300]   This is a segue to another story.
[01:18:35.300 --> 01:18:36.300]   The 5G health hazards.
[01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:39.300]   We'll get to that in just a second.
[01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:42.060]   First a word from our sponsor.
[01:18:42.060 --> 01:18:43.060]   You guys have to calm down.
[01:18:43.060 --> 01:18:44.060]   You haven't weighed too much.
[01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:45.060]   It's just great.
[01:18:45.060 --> 01:18:47.060]   Even without the coffee.
[01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:51.860]   Father Robert Balasier, he is running on fun-ranium.
[01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:52.860]   What is it?
[01:18:52.860 --> 01:18:53.860]   The dark blood of the earth.
[01:18:53.860 --> 01:18:55.260]   The black blood of the earth.
[01:18:55.260 --> 01:18:56.540]   The Kona blend.
[01:18:56.540 --> 01:18:58.740]   That stuff is good.
[01:18:58.740 --> 01:18:59.740]   We all...
[01:18:59.740 --> 01:19:02.500]   So they allow some drug use in the Vatican.
[01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:07.580]   Well, until recently they sold cigarettes in a duty-free shop in the Vatican.
[01:19:07.580 --> 01:19:09.620]   It was a mess.
[01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:10.620]   This is...
[01:19:10.620 --> 01:19:11.620]   I have to unpack this.
[01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:12.620]   I have a duty-free shop.
[01:19:12.620 --> 01:19:14.860]   They do it because it's its own country.
[01:19:14.860 --> 01:19:18.220]   And Pope Francis put an end to it because he noticed, wait a minute, you have people
[01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:22.220]   who are buying like five pallets of cigarettes every week.
[01:19:22.220 --> 01:19:25.380]   And they just go one foot and now they're in Rome and they can sell them.
[01:19:25.380 --> 01:19:29.180]   Well, because a cigarette in a pack of cigarettes in Rome will cost you like 10 euro.
[01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:32.940]   A pack of cigarettes in the Vatican used to cost you a euro.
[01:19:32.940 --> 01:19:33.940]   Oh.
[01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:34.940]   Profit.
[01:19:34.940 --> 01:19:35.940]   Are y'all hiring?
[01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:36.940]   Profit.
[01:19:36.940 --> 01:19:37.940]   Well, so hang on.
[01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:40.820]   You had sort of pre-sort of waddling out.
[01:19:40.820 --> 01:19:43.220]   Oh, no, no, no, I'm just putting a bit of white, really.
[01:19:43.220 --> 01:19:44.220]   Waddling out...
[01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:45.220]   We've got tunnels.
[01:19:45.220 --> 01:19:46.220]   We've got tunnels.
[01:19:46.220 --> 01:19:48.340]   Why do you think there's tunnels?
[01:19:48.340 --> 01:19:49.340]   I've read Dan Brown.
[01:19:49.340 --> 01:19:50.340]   I know about those.
[01:19:50.340 --> 01:19:51.580]   Ian Thompson is also here.
[01:19:51.580 --> 01:19:55.900]   He's the registered.co.uk and from Crunchbase News.
[01:19:55.900 --> 01:19:57.460]   Alex Wilhelmscream.
[01:19:57.460 --> 01:19:58.660]   Yes.
[01:19:58.660 --> 01:20:01.260]   Our show today brought to you by...
[01:20:01.260 --> 01:20:03.660]   Zip Recruiter.
[01:20:03.660 --> 01:20:05.340]   I like doing that.
[01:20:05.340 --> 01:20:06.700]   Zip Recruiter.
[01:20:06.700 --> 01:20:08.020]   Hiring is hard.
[01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:12.100]   If you're the hiring person at your company or if you're the sole proprietor at your company,
[01:20:12.100 --> 01:20:15.500]   you know it's really a pain in the butt when you're down a person.
[01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:16.500]   You need to hire somebody.
[01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:18.620]   You're already overworked.
[01:20:18.620 --> 01:20:21.900]   And then you've got to go to multiple job sites and you've got to filter through stacks
[01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:22.900]   of resumes.
[01:20:22.900 --> 01:20:26.340]   You've got to find some way to filter the wheat from the chaff.
[01:20:26.340 --> 01:20:28.620]   You've got to get all these phone calls.
[01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:30.420]   It's just a nightmare process.
[01:20:30.420 --> 01:20:34.860]   I know, because Lisa does the hiring here, when we have to hire somebody for Twit, I know
[01:20:34.860 --> 01:20:35.860]   I watch.
[01:20:35.860 --> 01:20:36.860]   It's painful.
[01:20:36.860 --> 01:20:39.980]   We got a two weeks notice from our bookkeeper.
[01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:41.380]   We had to hire a new bookkeeper.
[01:20:41.380 --> 01:20:44.580]   I said, "Lisa, Lisa, don't do all that.
[01:20:44.580 --> 01:20:45.820]   Zip Recruiter."
[01:20:45.820 --> 01:20:48.180]   She posted once on Zip Recruiter.
[01:20:48.180 --> 01:20:53.300]   It posts immediately to 100 plus job sites plus all the social networks.
[01:20:53.300 --> 01:20:54.300]   And here's the amazing thing.
[01:20:54.300 --> 01:20:56.520]   It doesn't come to your inbox.
[01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:58.060]   It goes into the Zip Recruiter interface.
[01:20:58.060 --> 01:21:00.780]   They pre-format all the resumes so they're scannable.
[01:21:00.780 --> 01:21:02.140]   You can look at them and they're easy to read.
[01:21:02.140 --> 01:21:06.820]   You even have questions you can put in there to screen out people who just don't qualify.
[01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:10.260]   There's no questions, multiple choice, even essay questions.
[01:21:10.260 --> 01:21:11.260]   No phone calls.
[01:21:11.260 --> 01:21:14.340]   It all goes into your Zip Recruiter inbox.
[01:21:14.340 --> 01:21:15.340]   Here's the thing.
[01:21:15.340 --> 01:21:18.780]   Lisa's going, "Oh, that means I got to do the books in two weeks.
[01:21:18.780 --> 01:21:20.940]   I'm never going to find somebody in two weeks."
[01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:22.180]   She posted it at breakfast.
[01:21:22.180 --> 01:21:23.180]   We were doing this.
[01:21:23.180 --> 01:21:26.780]   She posted it in Zip Recruiter at breakfast within an hour.
[01:21:26.780 --> 01:21:29.780]   Oh, this person's really good.
[01:21:29.780 --> 01:21:31.620]   Another hour.
[01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:37.020]   By lunch, we had three great resumes from highly qualified people.
[01:21:37.020 --> 01:21:39.620]   And that's something that we don't talk about a lot with Zip Recruiter.
[01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:41.540]   They use their matching technology.
[01:21:41.540 --> 01:21:43.460]   A lot of people apply for jobs at Zip Recruiter.
[01:21:43.460 --> 01:21:44.460]   It's a job site.
[01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:48.540]   So they have hundreds of thousands of current resumes.
[01:21:48.540 --> 01:21:52.140]   They'll scan those, find people who have the experience you're looking for, and then
[01:21:52.140 --> 01:21:54.900]   invite them to apply to your job.
[01:21:54.900 --> 01:21:55.900]   Zip Recruiter works so well.
[01:21:55.900 --> 01:21:58.260]   This works so well.
[01:21:58.260 --> 01:22:01.900]   The four out of five employers who post on Zip Recruiter get a quality candidate through
[01:22:01.900 --> 01:22:03.060]   the site within the first day.
[01:22:03.060 --> 01:22:04.140]   We got it within the first hour.
[01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:06.580]   I was blown away.
[01:22:06.580 --> 01:22:08.660]   Just really works.
[01:22:08.660 --> 01:22:14.060]   They also analyze each incoming application and they spotlight the top candidates so you're
[01:22:14.060 --> 01:22:16.020]   never going to miss a great match.
[01:22:16.020 --> 01:22:17.060]   You could try this for free.
[01:22:17.060 --> 01:22:18.820]   This is technology that really works.
[01:22:18.820 --> 01:22:20.780]   Zip Recruiter.com/twit.
[01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:22.900]   We've used it many times now.
[01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:23.900]   And it really works.
[01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:26.620]   Zip Recruiter.com/twit.
[01:22:26.620 --> 01:22:29.860]   Z-I-P-R-E-C-R-U-I-T-E-R.
[01:22:29.860 --> 01:22:31.620]   Zip Recruiter.com/twit.
[01:22:31.620 --> 01:22:34.980]   The smartest way to hire.
[01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:38.420]   Yes, we got a great book here as a result.
[01:22:38.420 --> 01:22:41.500]   Sure.
[01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:45.580]   So this whole thing about fluoride, remember that was a big thing in the '50s and '60s,
[01:22:45.580 --> 01:22:50.620]   was kind of the plot of Dr. Strangelove, your precious bodily fluids.
[01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:53.900]   And they're poisoning us with fluoride and there was a big movement to keep fluoride
[01:22:53.900 --> 01:22:55.420]   out of the water supply.
[01:22:55.420 --> 01:22:59.060]   Despite the fact that you had more fluoride and a cup of tea than you would in the '50s.
[01:22:59.060 --> 01:23:02.980]   And we never had it in Petaluma because of people who said no, no, no, no, it's poisonous.
[01:23:02.980 --> 01:23:03.980]   Oh, cavities.
[01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:05.460]   As a result, cavities.
[01:23:05.460 --> 01:23:06.460]   Cavities.
[01:23:06.460 --> 01:23:12.060]   In many regions of the country, no cavities at all because there's fluoride in the water.
[01:23:12.060 --> 01:23:16.940]   Our country had a military defense issue because of the fluoride in the water.
[01:23:16.940 --> 01:23:22.900]   And they were building the Blackbird, the S.R.71.
[01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:26.380]   That's made out of titanium panels and they did not know about that.
[01:23:26.380 --> 01:23:27.380]   They were washing it?
[01:23:27.380 --> 01:23:32.020]   So they were, yeah, the process of washing caused corrosion.
[01:23:32.020 --> 01:23:36.780]   And oh, and by the way, most of the titanium that went into the creation of the S.R.71
[01:23:36.780 --> 01:23:38.180]   fleet came from Russia.
[01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:40.540]   They were the number one exporters of titanium.
[01:23:40.540 --> 01:23:44.300]   So we bought Russian titanium and to ruin it with American water fluoride.
[01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:46.180]   I'm the Russians as Americans.
[01:23:46.180 --> 01:23:47.180]   But it had no cavities.
[01:23:47.180 --> 01:23:48.180]   Yeah.
[01:23:48.180 --> 01:23:49.180]   Killin' the game.
[01:23:49.180 --> 01:23:50.940]   I'm not gonna get in the fluoride debate.
[01:23:50.940 --> 01:23:52.460]   That's not what we're talking about here.
[01:23:52.460 --> 01:23:57.940]   However, the journal this week had an article about cities, including, ironically, one just
[01:23:57.940 --> 01:24:04.500]   to the north, Santa Rosa saying no to 5G for several reasons, but there is a big movement
[01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:07.380]   saying 5G is unhealthy.
[01:24:07.380 --> 01:24:14.660]   The FCC has said again and again that the 5G is no more hazardous than regular cell phone
[01:24:14.660 --> 01:24:19.260]   reception, which is not hazardous.
[01:24:19.260 --> 01:24:26.020]   Although the World Health Organization says that radio frequency emissions are as dangerous
[01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:30.300]   as other possibly carcinogenic substances as coffee and pickles.
[01:24:30.300 --> 01:24:33.300]   And I'm saying we'll give you up that coffee.
[01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:34.300]   More pickles.
[01:24:34.300 --> 01:24:37.180]   Well, pickles are just the fruit of the devil, but yeah.
[01:24:37.180 --> 01:24:38.940]   Hey, that's the first wrong thing that all of that.
[01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:40.420]   Deal pickles are awesome.
[01:24:40.420 --> 01:24:41.420]   Oh, no.
[01:24:41.420 --> 01:24:42.980]   I like bread and butter pickles.
[01:24:42.980 --> 01:24:45.140]   That's like napalm and you'll speak for me.
[01:24:45.140 --> 01:24:46.140]   Oh, horrible things.
[01:24:46.140 --> 01:24:47.140]   I can't eat them anymore.
[01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:49.220]   They're not cute, but I can eat all the deal pickles I want.
[01:24:49.220 --> 01:24:50.220]   Oh, that's right.
[01:24:50.220 --> 01:24:51.220]   They're all car.
[01:24:51.220 --> 01:24:52.700]   Is that why you look so much smaller than you used to?
[01:24:52.700 --> 01:24:53.700]   Yeah.
[01:24:53.700 --> 01:24:54.700]   Yeah.
[01:24:54.700 --> 01:24:55.700]   You look tremendous, by the way.
[01:24:55.700 --> 01:24:56.700]   Thank you, so do you.
[01:24:56.700 --> 01:24:57.700]   I mean, no crap aside, yes, you look good.
[01:24:57.700 --> 01:24:58.700]   You lost a lot of weight, too.
[01:24:58.700 --> 01:24:59.700]   How much did you lose?
[01:24:59.700 --> 01:25:01.460]   I walked into rehab at like 185.
[01:25:01.460 --> 01:25:02.460]   That was 160.
[01:25:02.460 --> 01:25:04.060]   So you lost it from not drinking?
[01:25:04.060 --> 01:25:07.020]   And a lot of fat from muscles I worked on.
[01:25:07.020 --> 01:25:08.860]   I'm not in good shape yet, but I'm getting there.
[01:25:08.860 --> 01:25:09.860]   You look pretty muscly.
[01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:12.060]   I mean, that's not just looking at me.
[01:25:12.060 --> 01:25:14.780]   I mean, I wasn't going to say it, but now that Leo said it good.
[01:25:14.780 --> 01:25:16.940]   Well, I wanted to say it was Leo looks good.
[01:25:16.940 --> 01:25:17.940]   Thank you.
[01:25:17.940 --> 01:25:18.940]   You can leave it there.
[01:25:18.940 --> 01:25:23.860]   I have lost about 20 pounds and more to go, but more importantly for me, I had type 2
[01:25:23.860 --> 01:25:28.780]   diabetes and I wanted to treat that high blood pressure and a lot of high cholesterol.
[01:25:28.780 --> 01:25:32.380]   All three indicators are backed down, not just a normal, but it's a low normal.
[01:25:32.380 --> 01:25:33.380]   Excellent.
[01:25:33.380 --> 01:25:34.900]   And he was shocked.
[01:25:34.900 --> 01:25:36.860]   He said, oh, this isn't going to work.
[01:25:36.860 --> 01:25:38.260]   And he was blown away.
[01:25:38.260 --> 01:25:40.300]   So it's not very, very good for me.
[01:25:40.300 --> 01:25:41.300]   But Peele keeps it up.
[01:25:41.300 --> 01:25:42.300]   I'm not recommending it.
[01:25:42.300 --> 01:25:43.300]   Yeah, just don't eat carbs.
[01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:44.300]   They're not good for you anyway.
[01:25:44.300 --> 01:25:46.300]   Yeah, but I screamed out some morale, improver.
[01:25:46.300 --> 01:25:48.660]   Ice cream is the single thing.
[01:25:48.660 --> 01:25:49.660]   You know what?
[01:25:49.660 --> 01:25:50.660]   Give me that.
[01:25:50.660 --> 01:25:53.620]   That's how Robert De Niro got fat for raging bull.
[01:25:53.620 --> 01:25:54.620]   He ate ice cream.
[01:25:54.620 --> 01:25:55.980]   In fact, an actor wants to get fat.
[01:25:55.980 --> 01:25:57.300]   What they do is they start eating ice cream.
[01:25:57.300 --> 01:25:58.300]   I don't eat ice cream.
[01:25:58.300 --> 01:25:59.300]   I only eat gelato.
[01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:00.300]   Yeah.
[01:26:00.300 --> 01:26:05.780]   Which they tell me, the locals tell me, no, this is an ice cream.
[01:26:05.780 --> 01:26:06.780]   It's gelato.
[01:26:06.780 --> 01:26:07.780]   Okay.
[01:26:07.780 --> 01:26:13.020]   Meanwhile, cities and towns throughout Northern California issuing ordinances, excluding 5G
[01:26:13.020 --> 01:26:18.980]   cell sites from residential areas, citing non-existent health concerns.
[01:26:18.980 --> 01:26:24.500]   Portland, Oregon, Whitefish, Montana, lobbying for restrictions, legislators in four states,
[01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:30.140]   including New Hampshire, proposing bills mandating further study of health effects before we
[01:26:30.140 --> 01:26:33.540]   do this big 5G rollout.
[01:26:33.540 --> 01:26:34.540]   That's true.
[01:26:34.540 --> 01:26:36.220]   5G will require four times the number of cells.
[01:26:36.220 --> 01:26:37.820]   It's millimeter wave.
[01:26:37.820 --> 01:26:38.820]   Correct.
[01:26:38.820 --> 01:26:39.820]   Yeah.
[01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:40.820]   Much higher frequency, much less penetration.
[01:26:40.820 --> 01:26:41.820]   Yeah.
[01:26:41.820 --> 01:26:42.820]   Not ionizing energy.
[01:26:42.820 --> 01:26:44.340]   That's the big thing.
[01:26:44.340 --> 01:26:45.860]   None of this is ionizing.
[01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:49.700]   Everyone's concerned about radiation, but you get radiation off of everything.
[01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:50.700]   Good question.
[01:26:50.700 --> 01:26:52.460]   The question is, how's Mac Ray is hitting you from the sun?
[01:26:52.460 --> 01:26:53.460]   Exactly.
[01:26:53.460 --> 01:26:54.460]   Is it ionizing radiation?
[01:26:54.460 --> 01:26:57.940]   That's the radiation you need to be concerned about and cell towers don't do that.
[01:26:57.940 --> 01:27:00.540]   They don't emit ionizing radiation.
[01:27:00.540 --> 01:27:01.540]   I forget what that means.
[01:27:01.540 --> 01:27:02.540]   Does anyone know?
[01:27:02.540 --> 01:27:06.500]   Ionizing radiation means that it's so energetic that it has the ability to make other substances,
[01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:07.500]   other atoms, radioactive.
[01:27:07.500 --> 01:27:09.500]   It's damaged yourself, essentially.
[01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:10.500]   Okay.
[01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:15.860]   And not to mention the fact that the power from these antennas diminishes by the inverse
[01:27:15.860 --> 01:27:16.860]   of the square.
[01:27:16.860 --> 01:27:17.860]   Yes, exactly.
[01:27:17.860 --> 01:27:19.260]   So you pack a lot more of them in.
[01:27:19.260 --> 01:27:22.780]   I think that's what's got a lot of people worried, plus, as the general.
[01:27:22.780 --> 01:27:26.260]   I mean, we still get people who claim that Wi-Fi signals drive them insane.
[01:27:26.260 --> 01:27:30.140]   And despite the fact there's never been peer reviewed, peer reviewed double blind testing
[01:27:30.140 --> 01:27:31.140]   to show it.
[01:27:31.140 --> 01:27:33.860]   And in fact, you can put one of these people in a room and turn the Wi-Fi on and off and
[01:27:33.860 --> 01:27:35.460]   they wouldn't notice the difference.
[01:27:35.460 --> 01:27:38.220]   The journal quotes a member of the Santa Rosa Chamber of Commerce.
[01:27:38.220 --> 01:27:41.260]   Again, just on the road a piece.
[01:27:41.260 --> 01:27:44.860]   His name is, I'll give him credit, Jack Tibbetts.
[01:27:44.860 --> 01:27:49.860]   He said for, it says, "For Mr. Tibbetts, it didn't matter whether those new antennas
[01:27:49.860 --> 01:27:52.500]   were actually dangerous.
[01:27:52.500 --> 01:27:53.500]   He was more concerned.
[01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:58.260]   More attached to utility poles, a mere 20 feet from people's bedroom windows.
[01:27:58.260 --> 01:28:02.100]   Residents complained Verizon had put them up without notifying them.
[01:28:02.100 --> 01:28:07.420]   They didn't want these ungainly chunks of public infrastructure anywhere near them.
[01:28:07.420 --> 01:28:11.780]   However, they still quite like having mobile phones, however, that's...
[01:28:11.780 --> 01:28:17.260]   Furthermore, Verizon doesn't have to ask.
[01:28:17.260 --> 01:28:21.460]   And there apparently is no legal power that can stop them.
[01:28:21.460 --> 01:28:25.580]   So you would need to create a new law.
[01:28:25.580 --> 01:28:29.540]   The other thing cities don't like is they don't have the leeway they used to have to
[01:28:29.540 --> 01:28:32.740]   set pricing for sell sites, federal government services.
[01:28:32.740 --> 01:28:34.820]   Yeah, that has really, really annoyed a lot.
[01:28:34.820 --> 01:28:41.020]   And particularly places like San Francisco where they could charge a lot for these stations
[01:28:41.020 --> 01:28:44.060]   and the FCC just said, "No, no, no, it's flat fee.
[01:28:44.060 --> 01:28:45.860]   Everyone, even if you're losing money on it."
[01:28:45.860 --> 01:28:46.860]   Which is ridiculous.
[01:28:46.860 --> 01:28:48.380]   Is that a new thing under Ajit?
[01:28:48.380 --> 01:28:49.380]   Yeah.
[01:28:49.380 --> 01:28:50.380]   Okay.
[01:28:50.380 --> 01:28:51.380]   And there's little babies.
[01:28:51.380 --> 01:28:56.220]   Well, and again, that favors the people who are putting up these sell towers.
[01:28:56.220 --> 01:29:01.260]   On the other hand, there is a certain societal benefit to having 5G, right?
[01:29:01.260 --> 01:29:05.660]   I mean, yeah, they're going to make money on it, but isn't it good for everybody if
[01:29:05.660 --> 01:29:07.380]   5G is ubiquitous or no?
[01:29:07.380 --> 01:29:11.300]   Well, there's very interesting talk that went on at Defcon where someone was saying,
[01:29:11.300 --> 01:29:17.620]   basically, you're not going to see a significant increase in speed from 5G.
[01:29:17.620 --> 01:29:21.500]   What you are going to get is all the back-end software which is sending, signaling back,
[01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:24.740]   that's going to be using the bulk of the stuff.
[01:29:24.740 --> 01:29:29.180]   And you're just going to get moderately faster speeds if you're really close to a sell tower.
[01:29:29.180 --> 01:29:33.740]   It would be as if you got yourself a 10 gig fiber connection, but you were only watching
[01:29:33.740 --> 01:29:36.220]   videos that required a dial-up connection.
[01:29:36.220 --> 01:29:38.620]   It's not really going to help the individual end user.
[01:29:38.620 --> 01:29:39.860]   It's going to help in the aggregate.
[01:29:39.860 --> 01:29:43.860]   As you're looking at the back-alls, connecting towers to other towers to other towers, that's
[01:29:43.860 --> 01:29:47.140]   where 5G really comes into play because you can use that bandwidth.
[01:29:47.140 --> 01:29:51.220]   So this builds out a lot of future capacity even if I will not get much higher resolution
[01:29:51.220 --> 01:29:52.660]   or speed on my individual phone.
[01:29:52.660 --> 01:29:53.660]   Correct.
[01:29:53.660 --> 01:29:57.500]   So it's still very important to the infrastructure element of the mobile broadband system.
[01:29:57.500 --> 01:29:59.180]   5G is great for point-to-point.
[01:29:59.180 --> 01:30:04.540]   If I have two fixed points, 5G would be fantastic because I can get a really solid wireless link
[01:30:04.540 --> 01:30:06.180]   between the two places.
[01:30:06.180 --> 01:30:11.180]   But to my phone, am I going to notice the difference between a 3G service and a 5G service?
[01:30:11.180 --> 01:30:12.180]   Probably not.
[01:30:12.180 --> 01:30:13.180]   You've got pretty fast service now.
[01:30:13.180 --> 01:30:14.180]   Exactly.
[01:30:14.180 --> 01:30:15.180]   3040 megabits.
[01:30:15.180 --> 01:30:18.740]   I mean, most of what you do on a phone, you don't need faster than that, right?
[01:30:18.740 --> 01:30:22.940]   So even if you're getting 100 megabits, you're not going to notice a big difference.
[01:30:22.940 --> 01:30:25.700]   This is the fabulous Randall Munro.
[01:30:25.700 --> 01:30:27.220]   Oh, XKCD's radiation.
[01:30:27.220 --> 01:30:30.220]   XKCD's chart about ionizing radiation sleeping.
[01:30:30.220 --> 01:30:37.500]   So they measure ionizing radiation in seavirts, sleeping next to someone, 0.05 seavirts, eating
[01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:40.180]   a banana, 0.1 seavirts.
[01:30:40.180 --> 01:30:45.900]   That's him. Living within 50 miles of a coal plant, 0.3 seavirts a year.
[01:30:45.900 --> 01:30:48.820]   Dental X-ray 5.
[01:30:48.820 --> 01:30:54.540]   Using a cell phone, 0, a cell phone's transmitter does not produce ionizing radiation unless
[01:30:54.540 --> 01:31:03.060]   it's a banana phone.
[01:31:03.060 --> 01:31:11.780]   In the normal yearly background dose from all sources, about four microseavirts, which
[01:31:11.780 --> 01:31:17.300]   that's a larger than the nano seavirts.
[01:31:17.300 --> 01:31:18.540]   That's that green at the bottom here.
[01:31:18.540 --> 01:31:19.940]   You're getting quite a bit of doses.
[01:31:19.940 --> 01:31:20.940]   Just walking around.
[01:31:20.940 --> 01:31:25.100]   There's a correlator to that though that explains why we get so afraid when people talk
[01:31:25.100 --> 01:31:26.980]   about radiation.
[01:31:26.980 --> 01:31:28.020]   Think to Chernobyl.
[01:31:28.020 --> 01:31:31.500]   There are people there who absorb massive doses.
[01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:35.900]   It should have been dead and they lived for 30 years.
[01:31:35.900 --> 01:31:40.260]   And there are people who got marginal fatal doses and they were dead within a week.
[01:31:40.260 --> 01:31:44.180]   So it's not just the amount of ionizing radiation that hits you.
[01:31:44.180 --> 01:31:45.780]   It's where does it hit you?
[01:31:45.780 --> 01:31:46.700]   How strong was it?
[01:31:46.700 --> 01:31:48.180]   How close were you to the source?
[01:31:48.180 --> 01:31:49.180]   How unlucky are you?
[01:31:49.180 --> 01:31:50.180]   How unlucky are you?
[01:31:50.180 --> 01:31:51.180]   By the way.
[01:31:51.180 --> 01:31:54.580]   Alex, you fly to Rhode Island every week or two, right?
[01:31:54.580 --> 01:31:55.580]   Every two weeks.
[01:31:55.580 --> 01:32:00.220]   An airplane flight from the New York del A 40 nano seavirts.
[01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:01.820]   Is that micro seavirts?
[01:32:01.820 --> 01:32:03.620]   It seems so just microwaved by this point.
[01:32:03.620 --> 01:32:05.340]   You've been fried, my friend.
[01:32:05.340 --> 01:32:07.740]   I actually just re-watched Chernobyl in the last couple days.
[01:32:07.740 --> 01:32:08.740]   That is great show.
[01:32:08.740 --> 01:32:09.740]   One's fantastic.
[01:32:09.740 --> 01:32:12.700]   But also I watched it because when I knew how it ended I wanted to go back and kind
[01:32:12.700 --> 01:32:15.220]   of re-see how things were done.
[01:32:15.220 --> 01:32:17.580]   And yet there wasn't like all of Europe died.
[01:32:17.580 --> 01:32:18.580]   They were worried by that at the beginning.
[01:32:18.580 --> 01:32:20.820]   I'd forgotten how terrifying the media would be.
[01:32:20.820 --> 01:32:22.820]   I feel like maybe this was just the TV show.
[01:32:22.820 --> 01:32:24.820]   There were lots of farmers who couldn't sell their sheep.
[01:32:24.820 --> 01:32:27.220]   No, there are people living in the exclusion zone right now.
[01:32:27.220 --> 01:32:28.820]   Our communities have moved back into the exclusion zone.
[01:32:28.820 --> 01:32:31.140]   You can get vodka from the exclusion zone.
[01:32:31.140 --> 01:32:37.260]   You see, I interviewed one of the last testers at Los Alamos who basically he managed the
[01:32:37.260 --> 01:32:39.740]   last hydrogen bomb test.
[01:32:39.740 --> 01:32:44.460]   And he was this cheerful old man in his 90s and he was convinced that the radiation,
[01:32:44.460 --> 01:32:46.620]   pure radiation counts were meaningless.
[01:32:46.620 --> 01:32:49.260]   Because he'd been around the stuff his entire life.
[01:32:49.260 --> 01:32:52.620]   He'd worked with people who'd run and he was just like, "It's a lot more about where
[01:32:52.620 --> 01:32:54.620]   it hits you, why it's even how..."
[01:32:54.620 --> 01:32:56.060]   And as you say, everyone lucky you are.
[01:32:56.060 --> 01:33:01.540]   Would you say it's safe not to worry about the proximity of cell towers or even 5G cell
[01:33:01.540 --> 01:33:02.540]   towers?
[01:33:02.540 --> 01:33:05.180]   I wouldn't want to give someone that assurance because...
[01:33:05.180 --> 01:33:07.140]   Well, we can't prove the negative precisely.
[01:33:07.140 --> 01:33:09.220]   No, I'd let's see some peer-reviewed research.
[01:33:09.220 --> 01:33:10.220]   I mean, I've...
[01:33:10.220 --> 01:33:11.220]   Well, there's been a lot of research.
[01:33:11.220 --> 01:33:14.700]   You know, people often say cell phones are dangerous.
[01:33:14.700 --> 01:33:19.660]   And if it were true that the radiation from cell phones causes cancer, you would expect
[01:33:19.660 --> 01:33:23.460]   at least one of the things you'd expect of the last 20 or 30 years as an increase in
[01:33:23.460 --> 01:33:24.460]   particularly brain cancers.
[01:33:24.460 --> 01:33:25.460]   Except Leo.
[01:33:25.460 --> 01:33:27.460]   That's not where people keep their phones.
[01:33:27.460 --> 01:33:31.180]   Where do you keep your phone?
[01:33:31.180 --> 01:33:32.180]   In your pocket?
[01:33:32.180 --> 01:33:34.180]   Has there been more hip cancer?
[01:33:34.180 --> 01:33:38.700]   No, but there has been a decrease in spermotility in developed worlds.
[01:33:38.700 --> 01:33:39.700]   I just talked with Stylo.
[01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:41.580]   I think there's other reasons for that.
[01:33:41.580 --> 01:33:46.380]   I just talked to a star called Legacy at Y Combinator ZF, our earlier conversation.
[01:33:46.380 --> 01:33:49.340]   I'm curious as to where you're going with this.
[01:33:49.340 --> 01:33:51.140]   It's like...
[01:33:51.140 --> 01:33:54.540]   How Han's almost this demonstration.
[01:33:54.540 --> 01:33:55.540]   I'm hyped down.
[01:33:55.540 --> 01:33:59.660]   I talked to a star called Legacy at YC's Demo Day on Monday.
[01:33:59.660 --> 01:34:02.900]   And they are doing sperm freezing for men, essentially.
[01:34:02.900 --> 01:34:03.900]   Oh, naturally.
[01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:08.180]   What we were talking about was they were advocating that I wear these special underwear that
[01:34:08.180 --> 01:34:10.380]   are designed to protect your bits from radiation.
[01:34:10.380 --> 01:34:11.820]   They're lined with silver.
[01:34:11.820 --> 01:34:12.820]   And I went...
[01:34:12.820 --> 01:34:13.820]   Well, maybe.
[01:34:13.820 --> 01:34:14.820]   I don't know.
[01:34:14.820 --> 01:34:15.820]   So they wanted to advertise with us.
[01:34:15.820 --> 01:34:16.820]   Oh, really?
[01:34:16.820 --> 01:34:17.820]   Anyways, I was...
[01:34:17.820 --> 01:34:20.820]   And I just listened to him and I was like, "Nah."
[01:34:20.820 --> 01:34:22.980]   Like, it didn't seem to be a big enough threat.
[01:34:22.980 --> 01:34:25.500]   In my opinion, your question of us should be worried about this is no.
[01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:26.500]   No.
[01:34:26.500 --> 01:34:27.500]   Yeah.
[01:34:27.500 --> 01:34:31.620]   By the way, there's been a drop in brain cancers over the last 30 years.
[01:34:31.620 --> 01:34:33.340]   I think you would see...
[01:34:33.340 --> 01:34:34.740]   It's not like this is a new technology.
[01:34:34.740 --> 01:34:36.220]   We would see this by now.
[01:34:36.220 --> 01:34:41.740]   This cell phone radiation is a lot closer to you than a cell tower 40 feet away or 400
[01:34:41.740 --> 01:34:42.900]   feet away.
[01:34:42.900 --> 01:34:46.500]   And there is apparently no greater danger for millimeter waves than there would be.
[01:34:46.500 --> 01:34:48.060]   Because none of it is ionizing.
[01:34:48.060 --> 01:34:52.260]   I mean, you had a far greater chance of developing a cancer.
[01:34:52.260 --> 01:34:55.420]   If you slept on top of one of those heating mats.
[01:34:55.420 --> 01:34:57.460]   Because they generated an enormous amount of GM.
[01:34:57.460 --> 01:34:58.460]   Yeah.
[01:34:58.460 --> 01:34:59.460]   Really?
[01:34:59.460 --> 01:35:00.460]   Oh, gosh.
[01:35:00.460 --> 01:35:03.820]   I'm a little worried because I sleep on a sleep tracker, which is a little paddle that
[01:35:03.820 --> 01:35:06.660]   you put on the mattress and it tells you all about your sleep patterns.
[01:35:06.660 --> 01:35:10.660]   I actually talked to somebody and said, "You know, there's a lot of EMF coming up."
[01:35:10.660 --> 01:35:11.660]   Yeah.
[01:35:11.660 --> 01:35:14.300]   "You might want to consider removing your sleep tracker paddle."
[01:35:14.300 --> 01:35:15.300]   Yeah.
[01:35:15.300 --> 01:35:18.100]   I know this is part of the problems of buying a new mattress.
[01:35:18.100 --> 01:35:21.540]   I say with a guy who works in the field.
[01:35:21.540 --> 01:35:23.900]   So how much do they off gasket?
[01:35:23.900 --> 01:35:24.900]   Two or three years, basically.
[01:35:24.900 --> 01:35:26.100]   That's a little carry on doing it.
[01:35:26.100 --> 01:35:28.500]   I wasn't talking about that, but that's another issue.
[01:35:28.500 --> 01:35:29.500]   Yeah.
[01:35:29.500 --> 01:35:32.140]   So I should mention Randall Monroe is going to be on triangulation on Friday.
[01:35:32.140 --> 01:35:33.140]   Oh, really?
[01:35:33.140 --> 01:35:34.140]   The creator of XKCD.
[01:35:34.140 --> 01:35:35.140]   I'm very excited.
[01:35:35.140 --> 01:35:36.140]   Oh, wow.
[01:35:36.140 --> 01:35:39.700]   I mean, we've all admired this guy for so long.
[01:35:39.700 --> 01:35:41.500]   Ah, he's the Internet's called Jester.
[01:35:41.500 --> 01:35:43.980]   He is incredible cartoonist comic book.
[01:35:43.980 --> 01:35:47.780]   But the thing is he understands technology so well and he's taught people more about
[01:35:47.780 --> 01:35:50.740]   technology I think than any of us have.
[01:35:50.740 --> 01:35:51.740]   He's really amazing.
[01:35:51.740 --> 01:35:54.140]   He's got a new book which is hysterical.
[01:35:54.140 --> 01:35:58.620]   How to absurd scientific advice for common real world problems.
[01:35:58.620 --> 01:36:01.940]   It is a laugh riot.
[01:36:01.940 --> 01:36:07.460]   He actually predicted the future years and years ago when the TSA started confiscating
[01:36:07.460 --> 01:36:09.140]   like more than three ounces of liquid.
[01:36:09.140 --> 01:36:10.140]   Yeah.
[01:36:10.140 --> 01:36:13.340]   He had his character going through the security line saying, "Wait a minute.
[01:36:13.340 --> 01:36:14.340]   Wait a minute.
[01:36:14.340 --> 01:36:18.580]   My battery in my laptop is far more destructive than anything I could bring in three ounces."
[01:36:18.580 --> 01:36:19.580]   Oh, don't say it.
[01:36:19.580 --> 01:36:22.620]   Like within a year that became a thing for the TSA.
[01:36:22.620 --> 01:36:23.620]   Yeah.
[01:36:23.620 --> 01:36:24.620]   I mean, coming back to you.
[01:36:24.620 --> 01:36:26.100]   A guy tries to light his shoes on fire.
[01:36:26.100 --> 01:36:27.500]   Suddenly we all have to take off our shoes.
[01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:28.500]   Yeah.
[01:36:28.500 --> 01:36:29.500]   I mean, it comes back to what you were saying about radiation.
[01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:34.060]   He has a wonderful essay where he's just like he looked at how close could he get to
[01:36:34.060 --> 01:36:38.900]   the fuel rods in a nuclear reactor before you got a lethal dose of radiation.
[01:36:38.900 --> 01:36:44.060]   And because the fuel rods are kept under water, you're actually getting lesser radiation
[01:36:44.060 --> 01:36:47.140]   as you swim down to them than you would be if you're on the surface, getting it from
[01:36:47.140 --> 01:36:48.140]   the sun.
[01:36:48.140 --> 01:36:52.100]   I did point out at the end of it that the health risks were slightly more complicated than
[01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:55.340]   that because you would be riddled with several bullets before you could actually get down
[01:36:55.340 --> 01:36:56.340]   it.
[01:36:56.340 --> 01:37:00.900]   But in this new book, he talks about how to predict the weather by analyzing the pixels
[01:37:00.900 --> 01:37:05.920]   of your Facebook photos, how to tell if you're a baby boomer or a 90s kid by measuring the
[01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:11.740]   radioactivity of your teeth, and tips for taking a selfie with a telescope, plus how
[01:37:11.740 --> 01:37:13.980]   to cross a river by boiling it.
[01:37:13.980 --> 01:37:15.700]   Randall Monroe will be on triangulation Friday.
[01:37:15.700 --> 01:37:18.860]   I would like to spend a couple of hours in that guy's mind.
[01:37:18.860 --> 01:37:20.340]   That sounds fun.
[01:37:20.340 --> 01:37:21.340]   That sounds fun.
[01:37:21.340 --> 01:37:22.340]   This person looks so good.
[01:37:22.340 --> 01:37:23.340]   Yeah.
[01:37:23.340 --> 01:37:24.340]   His book, what if?
[01:37:24.340 --> 01:37:25.340]   Tremendous.
[01:37:25.340 --> 01:37:27.620]   He also gave a very good talk that's on YouTube.
[01:37:27.620 --> 01:37:30.900]   He was one of the only, he invited down to speak to Google because you know they do
[01:37:30.900 --> 01:37:32.580]   research and stuff.
[01:37:32.580 --> 01:37:35.500]   Fascinating lecture, very, very funny indeed.
[01:37:35.500 --> 01:37:39.020]   And he reveals which cartoon it was that causes a strange woman to just come up to
[01:37:39.020 --> 01:37:41.220]   him and hug him spontaneously.
[01:37:41.220 --> 01:37:42.220]   All of them.
[01:37:42.220 --> 01:37:43.220]   Wow.
[01:37:43.220 --> 01:37:44.220]   Really good.
[01:37:44.220 --> 01:37:46.300]   He's got a favorite XKCD comic.
[01:37:46.300 --> 01:37:47.300]   Yeah.
[01:37:47.300 --> 01:37:51.340]   It's rare that we'll have a conversation about anything from passwords to radiations.
[01:37:51.340 --> 01:37:52.940]   There's not an XKCD somewhere.
[01:37:52.940 --> 01:37:54.620]   Two little bobby drop tables.
[01:37:54.620 --> 01:37:56.620]   That's my favorite, by the way.
[01:37:56.620 --> 01:37:57.620]   That is my dad's.
[01:37:57.620 --> 01:37:58.620]   Your inputs.
[01:37:58.620 --> 01:37:59.620]   Somebody won't post an XKCD.
[01:37:59.620 --> 01:38:01.180]   By the way, someone did that.
[01:38:01.180 --> 01:38:04.300]   Did you see that story of the guy who changed his name to null?
[01:38:04.300 --> 01:38:05.300]   No, no, no, no.
[01:38:05.300 --> 01:38:06.300]   The license plate.
[01:38:06.300 --> 01:38:07.300]   The license plate's a null.
[01:38:07.300 --> 01:38:08.300]   The license plate's a null.
[01:38:08.300 --> 01:38:10.580]   And yes, he got all eight thousands worth of tickets.
[01:38:10.580 --> 01:38:14.380]   So he wanted to, I think he was looking for another nice license plate, null something
[01:38:14.380 --> 01:38:15.460]   else.
[01:38:15.460 --> 01:38:18.940]   And as he entered it in, it truncated it and submitted null.
[01:38:18.940 --> 01:38:20.820]   He said, yeah, something like that.
[01:38:20.820 --> 01:38:22.660]   I would love to have null.
[01:38:22.660 --> 01:38:24.660]   So he submitted it.
[01:38:24.660 --> 01:38:28.500]   And it turns out that if a law enforcement officer writes a ticket and neglects to put
[01:38:28.500 --> 01:38:36.340]   the license plate in, the software puts null in the ticket, which means he's been getting
[01:38:36.340 --> 01:38:38.500]   tickets from all over the country.
[01:38:38.500 --> 01:38:42.780]   He's got over $8,000 worth of fines for the license.
[01:38:42.780 --> 01:38:45.380]   Just doing a joke to put a big target on his back.
[01:38:45.380 --> 01:38:46.380]   Yep.
[01:38:46.380 --> 01:38:48.220]   $12,000 or 12,000 tickets.
[01:38:48.220 --> 01:38:53.220]   $12,000 in traffic fines incorrectly.
[01:38:53.220 --> 01:38:55.180]   Can you imagine trying to work your way out of that?
[01:38:55.180 --> 01:38:57.100]   That was a recent Defcon talk he talked about.
[01:38:57.100 --> 01:38:58.100]   Yeah.
[01:38:58.100 --> 01:38:59.100]   I mean, it's a great joke.
[01:38:59.100 --> 01:39:01.380]   I don't know if I would be that committed to the bit.
[01:39:01.380 --> 01:39:05.140]   Like the first time I received a bill, I'd be like, I don't think he did it on purpose.
[01:39:05.140 --> 01:39:06.900]   And I think once it happened, it was that he like.
[01:39:06.900 --> 01:39:07.900]   No, but now he.
[01:39:07.900 --> 01:39:10.500]   Now he's saying, but I didn't do anything wrong.
[01:39:10.500 --> 01:39:11.980]   So they should fix their system.
[01:39:11.980 --> 01:39:12.980]   Good luck.
[01:39:12.980 --> 01:39:14.940]   Yeah, good luck with that.
[01:39:14.940 --> 01:39:16.820]   Just ask little Bobby drop tables.
[01:39:16.820 --> 01:39:17.820]   How that went.
[01:39:17.820 --> 01:39:20.420]   That's why you sanitize your inputs.
[01:39:20.420 --> 01:39:21.420]   Sanitize your inputs.
[01:39:21.420 --> 01:39:26.260]   Actually, the Chicago Tribune did a really interesting piece where they did the same
[01:39:26.260 --> 01:39:30.740]   kind of testing the Federal Communications Commission does to cell phones.
[01:39:30.740 --> 01:39:41.060]   They found that the iPhone 7 is significantly above the standard set by the FCC, more than
[01:39:41.060 --> 01:39:47.060]   double what Apple reported to federal regulators and very dangerous.
[01:39:47.060 --> 01:39:51.740]   Now they only tested three iPhone 7s.
[01:39:51.740 --> 01:39:55.220]   I suppose it's possible given their age that they could be more dangerous.
[01:39:55.220 --> 01:39:58.540]   Maybe they've been dropped or maybe the cases are warped.
[01:39:58.540 --> 01:40:01.540]   It is not as thorough a test maybe as the FCC does.
[01:40:01.540 --> 01:40:05.180]   But I think it's interesting that Chicago Tribune took this on.
[01:40:05.180 --> 01:40:07.340]   And the results are really kind of shocking.
[01:40:07.340 --> 01:40:11.300]   It's also kind of annoying that they actually felt the need that they had to.
[01:40:11.300 --> 01:40:14.260]   We couldn't trust the FCC to do this properly because it sounds like they've been asleep
[01:40:14.260 --> 01:40:15.260]   at the switch again.
[01:40:15.260 --> 01:40:18.180]   You know, I've been to the FCC testing center in Washington, DC.
[01:40:18.180 --> 01:40:24.780]   They have a human shaped mannequin filled with a solution that is made of a variety of
[01:40:24.780 --> 01:40:32.020]   materials like sugar and salt to duplicate the transmission and transmission qualities
[01:40:32.020 --> 01:40:33.500]   of human flesh.
[01:40:33.500 --> 01:40:34.900]   And then they have a robotic arm.
[01:40:34.900 --> 01:40:37.660]   And by the way, this is exactly what the Tribune did.
[01:40:37.660 --> 01:40:43.940]   They have a robotic arm, which then positions the smartphone all around that.
[01:40:43.940 --> 01:40:45.420]   And then they measure internally.
[01:40:45.420 --> 01:40:50.940]   They measure how much is received through the medium.
[01:40:50.940 --> 01:40:56.940]   Well, I think so they're testing EIRP, the effective emitted radiation.
[01:40:56.940 --> 01:41:01.580]   And that falls under certificate 47 at the FCC, which they will not be.
[01:41:01.580 --> 01:41:08.340]   We covered this on quiet a while back.
[01:41:08.340 --> 01:41:10.780]   They actually trust the numbers from the manufacturers.
[01:41:10.780 --> 01:41:13.180]   They're supposed to eventually test it.
[01:41:13.180 --> 01:41:16.740]   But years back, they started fast tracking it because they were getting way more to
[01:41:16.740 --> 01:41:17.740]   license.
[01:41:17.740 --> 01:41:19.740]   And they could test.
[01:41:19.740 --> 01:41:24.780]   So eventually they could get to it and de-certify, but they don't have the manpower.
[01:41:24.780 --> 01:41:25.780]   Yeah.
[01:41:25.780 --> 01:41:28.020]   Which was the company that lied about the diesel tests?
[01:41:28.020 --> 01:41:29.020]   VW.
[01:41:29.020 --> 01:41:31.100]   I mean, I think that just shows you the flaw in that.
[01:41:31.100 --> 01:41:32.100]   Yeah.
[01:41:32.100 --> 01:41:33.100]   Well, look at Boeing with a 737.
[01:41:33.100 --> 01:41:35.100]   Actually, because they were allowed to test their own.
[01:41:35.100 --> 01:41:36.380]   VW didn't lie.
[01:41:36.380 --> 01:41:42.220]   They modified their software to notice when they were on one of those machines and change
[01:41:42.220 --> 01:41:45.660]   their mix so that it would be the lower emissions vehicle.
[01:41:45.660 --> 01:41:47.220]   That's much worse than lying.
[01:41:47.220 --> 01:41:48.220]   That's intense.
[01:41:48.220 --> 01:41:49.220]   That's intense.
[01:41:49.220 --> 01:41:50.220]   That's intense.
[01:41:50.220 --> 01:41:55.380]   It's interesting to see how that was viewed over here and in Europe, because a lot of
[01:41:55.380 --> 01:41:58.180]   I've got some friends in the car industry back in the UK.
[01:41:58.180 --> 01:42:02.140]   And they were saying, yeah, but I can kind of understand why they did it, because diesel
[01:42:02.140 --> 01:42:06.620]   emission standards are set ludicrously high in this country, higher than some European
[01:42:06.620 --> 01:42:12.180]   countries, because the auto industry doesn't make diesels and doesn't want the competition.
[01:42:12.180 --> 01:42:14.180]   So they are set very high indeed.
[01:42:14.180 --> 01:42:16.540]   So they felt justified because it was the aim to actually...
[01:42:16.540 --> 01:42:19.700]   Obviously, it was anti-European right now.
[01:42:19.700 --> 01:42:24.660]   Except, except diesel has something that gas cars don't do, which is a high level of
[01:42:24.660 --> 01:42:25.660]   particulates.
[01:42:25.660 --> 01:42:27.420]   Particulates is what we don't want.
[01:42:27.420 --> 01:42:29.980]   I mean, you go to Europe to diesel countries and...
[01:42:29.980 --> 01:42:30.980]   Oh, yeah.
[01:42:30.980 --> 01:42:31.980]   It's everywhere.
[01:42:31.980 --> 01:42:32.980]   Yeah.
[01:42:32.980 --> 01:42:33.980]   I get soot.
[01:42:33.980 --> 01:42:34.980]   If I leave my window open, I get a nice little car...
[01:42:34.980 --> 01:42:35.980]   I'm casting soot.
[01:42:35.980 --> 01:42:36.980]   And everything.
[01:42:36.980 --> 01:42:37.980]   Oh, yeah.
[01:42:37.980 --> 01:42:38.980]   Yeah.
[01:42:38.980 --> 01:42:39.980]   Electric.
[01:42:39.980 --> 01:42:40.980]   Everybody's just driving EVs.
[01:42:40.980 --> 01:42:41.980]   I love my EV.
[01:42:41.980 --> 01:42:44.700]   I come to long road trips on them though.
[01:42:44.700 --> 01:42:45.700]   That's the problem.
[01:42:45.700 --> 01:42:46.700]   Sure you can.
[01:42:46.700 --> 01:42:47.700]   In fact, one of the...
[01:42:47.700 --> 01:42:54.500]   Weirdly enough, one of the side effects of dieselgate is that Audi has made a $2 billion
[01:42:54.500 --> 01:43:00.140]   settlement to build $2 billion worth of electrical charging stations across the United States.
[01:43:00.140 --> 01:43:01.140]   That's nice.
[01:43:01.140 --> 01:43:02.220]   It's called Electrify America.
[01:43:02.220 --> 01:43:04.020]   They're fast chargers.
[01:43:04.020 --> 01:43:05.940]   They will work with any CCS vehicle.
[01:43:05.940 --> 01:43:07.700]   Our Chevy Bolt will use it.
[01:43:07.700 --> 01:43:08.700]   Okay.
[01:43:08.700 --> 01:43:12.220]   And so there will be a significantly larger number of chargers all over the country.
[01:43:12.220 --> 01:43:13.220]   Thanks to dieselgate.
[01:43:13.220 --> 01:43:14.220]   Oh, yeah.
[01:43:14.220 --> 01:43:15.820]   It's a net win.
[01:43:15.820 --> 01:43:18.180]   You can make it from San Francisco to Las Vegas.
[01:43:18.180 --> 01:43:20.180]   They put superchargers in Baker and...
[01:43:20.180 --> 01:43:21.180]   Yeah.
[01:43:21.180 --> 01:43:23.620]   And Electrify said, "What do you want to go to Las Vegas?"
[01:43:23.620 --> 01:43:25.460]   Yeah, on the five of it, Harris Ranch.
[01:43:25.460 --> 01:43:26.460]   Exactly.
[01:43:26.460 --> 01:43:27.460]   Yeah.
[01:43:27.460 --> 01:43:31.060]   So you could charge 30 minutes at Harris Ranch and 30 minutes at Baker and make it all
[01:43:31.060 --> 01:43:32.060]   away to it.
[01:43:32.060 --> 01:43:34.140]   The Tesla at least was great because it would say, "Okay, you're going to stop here.
[01:43:34.140 --> 01:43:35.140]   Have lunch.
[01:43:35.140 --> 01:43:36.140]   You've got 30 minutes there."
[01:43:36.140 --> 01:43:38.140]   And they wouldn't even try to charge you up all the way just enough so that you could get
[01:43:38.140 --> 01:43:39.820]   to the next one and the next one.
[01:43:39.820 --> 01:43:43.220]   So it was actually a pretty easy system.
[01:43:43.220 --> 01:43:46.460]   Anyway, enough said.
[01:43:46.460 --> 01:43:50.660]   We're going to talk about maybe the worst IPO.
[01:43:50.660 --> 01:43:53.380]   Oh, we've been looking for...
[01:43:53.380 --> 01:43:55.300]   Alex is sharpening his teeth.
[01:43:55.300 --> 01:43:57.580]   We got our financial guy here.
[01:43:57.580 --> 01:43:58.980]   We got to talk about that.
[01:43:58.980 --> 01:44:04.300]   And then an Instagram privacy hoax that you should not fall for coming up.
[01:44:04.300 --> 01:44:06.260]   But first a word from cash fly.
[01:44:06.260 --> 01:44:08.940]   Cash fly literally brings you this show every week.
[01:44:08.940 --> 01:44:12.980]   When you download any of our shows, you're not downloading it from our website.
[01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:15.980]   You're downloading it from our content delivery network.
[01:44:15.980 --> 01:44:16.980]   Cash fly.
[01:44:16.980 --> 01:44:17.980]   Why do we do that?
[01:44:17.980 --> 01:44:21.220]   Well, because cash fly has servers all over the world, hundreds of them.
[01:44:21.220 --> 01:44:25.340]   So you're going to download it from somewhere that's nearer to you than our server.
[01:44:25.340 --> 01:44:26.900]   Plus, it's a CDN.
[01:44:26.900 --> 01:44:30.580]   So it's designed to do exactly that.
[01:44:30.580 --> 01:44:35.700]   You 30% faster than the competition.
[01:44:35.700 --> 01:44:37.380]   And it never goes down.
[01:44:37.380 --> 01:44:42.020]   It's literally a 100% SLI because they have so many servers even if one or two went down,
[01:44:42.020 --> 01:44:43.340]   the quit must roll.
[01:44:43.340 --> 01:44:45.860]   You will always get your Twitter.
[01:44:45.860 --> 01:44:47.940]   People have told me several many times.
[01:44:47.940 --> 01:44:51.780]   One of the reasons I don't subscribe or don't listen to a podcast because it took too long
[01:44:51.780 --> 01:44:54.340]   to get it, but it never takes too long to get Twitter.
[01:44:54.340 --> 01:44:55.580]   It's not just podcasts.
[01:44:55.580 --> 01:45:01.300]   Any kind of content that you're delivering from applications to content to data, you should
[01:45:01.300 --> 01:45:03.420]   be using a CDN.
[01:45:03.420 --> 01:45:04.980]   And I think you should be using cash fly.
[01:45:04.980 --> 01:45:06.340]   We've been on cash life for 10 years.
[01:45:06.340 --> 01:45:11.260]   It delivers rich media content 10 times faster than if you were getting it from our website.
[01:45:11.260 --> 01:45:17.140]   30% faster than other big name CDNs with 100% SLA.
[01:45:17.140 --> 01:45:20.500]   You're going to get the best user experience for your customers and the best experience
[01:45:20.500 --> 01:45:26.300]   for you because you don't have to, they work out a price based on your yearly usage.
[01:45:26.300 --> 01:45:28.060]   So you're not logging in every week.
[01:45:28.060 --> 01:45:31.420]   You know, we have very spiky, very spiky downloads.
[01:45:31.420 --> 01:45:34.700]   I don't have to log in every week to see, oh gosh, do we go over our monthly bandwidth
[01:45:34.700 --> 01:45:36.540]   limit because it's a year.
[01:45:36.540 --> 01:45:37.540]   It's a year.
[01:45:37.540 --> 01:45:40.420]   And they smooth out all those peaks.
[01:45:40.420 --> 01:45:47.540]   We literally deliver through cash fly petabytes of data every month to you, our fabulous listeners.
[01:45:47.540 --> 01:45:49.500]   And I am so grateful to cash fly.
[01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:50.660]   I think you will be too.
[01:45:50.660 --> 01:45:52.660]   No billing spikes.
[01:45:52.660 --> 01:45:55.740]   You'll save more than 20% on average.
[01:45:55.740 --> 01:45:57.340]   And you'll never be down.
[01:45:57.340 --> 01:45:58.780]   It's not just us.
[01:45:58.780 --> 01:46:00.300]   R's technique uses cash fly.
[01:46:00.300 --> 01:46:01.580]   LG uses cash fly.
[01:46:01.580 --> 01:46:02.900]   Microsoft and Adobe.
[01:46:02.900 --> 01:46:05.260]   Yes, they use cash fly.
[01:46:05.260 --> 01:46:11.220]   You know, you can get a complimentary detailed analysis of your current CDN bill and usage
[01:46:11.220 --> 01:46:15.300]   trends to see how much you could save if you went to cash fly.
[01:46:15.300 --> 01:46:18.100]   No heavy selling, no, no push.
[01:46:18.100 --> 01:46:20.940]   Just the information you need to make the right decision.
[01:46:20.940 --> 01:46:21.940]   Here's what you do.
[01:46:21.940 --> 01:46:23.940]   Go to twit.cash fly.com.
[01:46:23.940 --> 01:46:26.780]   Twit.cash fly.com.
[01:46:26.780 --> 01:46:28.180]   Thank you cash fly.
[01:46:28.180 --> 01:46:33.780]   It's been a decade long relationship and it's never going to end because as long as we can
[01:46:33.780 --> 01:46:39.020]   get you the content better, we will cash fly twit.cash fly.com.
[01:46:39.020 --> 01:46:41.740]   Cash fly was actually a dignity sponsor way back in the next.
[01:46:41.740 --> 01:46:42.740]   Yes.
[01:46:42.740 --> 01:46:43.740]   Yes.
[01:46:43.740 --> 01:46:44.740]   That's my first heard of them.
[01:46:44.740 --> 01:46:45.740]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:46:45.740 --> 01:46:46.740]   Good.
[01:46:46.740 --> 01:46:47.740]   So Matt Levine who founded cash fly.
[01:46:47.740 --> 01:46:48.740]   We were in the early days of Twitter.
[01:46:48.740 --> 01:46:49.740]   I was using bit torrent.
[01:46:49.740 --> 01:46:54.380]   I would ask listeners, can you please see it if anybody wants to see it.
[01:46:54.380 --> 01:46:55.380]   Remember that?
[01:46:55.380 --> 01:46:56.700]   We just we you know, we've had a Drupal site.
[01:46:56.700 --> 01:46:57.700]   You would get it directly from that.
[01:46:57.700 --> 01:46:58.700]   Then I got the bill.
[01:46:58.700 --> 01:47:01.540]   It was just a nightmare.
[01:47:01.540 --> 01:47:05.220]   And Matt Levine heard me whining about it and he said, look, come to cash fly.
[01:47:05.220 --> 01:47:06.500]   He was the founder of cash.
[01:47:06.500 --> 01:47:08.980]   I think dignity and same things come to cash.
[01:47:08.980 --> 01:47:10.740]   And that really saved our life.
[01:47:10.740 --> 01:47:12.660]   We couldn't twit wouldn't exist without cash.
[01:47:12.660 --> 01:47:14.540]   I'm very grateful to them.
[01:47:14.540 --> 01:47:21.100]   So two articles about a new tech IPO.
[01:47:21.100 --> 01:47:22.380]   We work.
[01:47:22.380 --> 01:47:24.500]   Best company ever.
[01:47:24.500 --> 01:47:30.020]   I have to say I'm a little bit of a fan of Scott Calloway's post.
[01:47:30.020 --> 01:47:33.940]   He calls it not we work, but we WTF.
[01:47:33.940 --> 01:47:37.700]   He's a professor of business at the Stern School at NYU.
[01:47:37.700 --> 01:47:42.860]   And I asked Jeff Jarvis because I thought, well, he's Jeff said, it's too much showbiz,
[01:47:42.860 --> 01:47:43.860]   too much showbiz.
[01:47:43.860 --> 01:47:48.220]   But because yes, there's cartoons, there's jokes.
[01:47:48.220 --> 01:47:49.900]   He really mocks them.
[01:47:49.900 --> 01:47:52.220]   But he brings up the kind of the important point.
[01:47:52.220 --> 01:47:55.980]   Alex, I'll defer to you a little bit on this.
[01:47:55.980 --> 01:48:00.100]   There are a lot of red flags including the fact that the founder sold $700 million in
[01:48:00.100 --> 01:48:01.100]   stock before the top.
[01:48:01.100 --> 01:48:03.500]   It's got a little bit more pause there.
[01:48:03.500 --> 01:48:07.700]   But this is the graph Scott puts in there.
[01:48:07.700 --> 01:48:10.700]   They say some red flags, the entire report was scallop painted.
[01:48:10.700 --> 01:48:16.100]   But they call it apparently analysts call this a duration problem or duration mismatch.
[01:48:16.100 --> 01:48:17.100]   What's that?
[01:48:17.100 --> 01:48:22.060]   So if you sign a long term lease and we work as long as 15 years for their properties.
[01:48:22.060 --> 01:48:26.020]   They have dozens of billions of dollars of long term lease commitments that they are
[01:48:26.020 --> 01:48:27.020]   on the hook for.
[01:48:27.020 --> 01:48:28.020]   No matter what.
[01:48:28.020 --> 01:48:29.020]   No matter what.
[01:48:29.020 --> 01:48:32.740]   But if you go to a we work and sign up for a month or six months, you want a short term
[01:48:32.740 --> 01:48:33.740]   lease thing.
[01:48:33.740 --> 01:48:37.380]   So in a sense, we work is a bit of arbitrage between lease timings and their ability to
[01:48:37.380 --> 01:48:41.580]   have drive margin on their shorter term leases to make money against their long term cost
[01:48:41.580 --> 01:48:45.020]   commitments that they've paid to the buildings.
[01:48:45.020 --> 01:48:47.180]   Everyone was really curious about kind of a couple of things about this.
[01:48:47.180 --> 01:48:49.260]   One, how much money were they losing?
[01:48:49.260 --> 01:48:51.140]   Everyone knew they were going to lose a lot of money.
[01:48:51.140 --> 01:48:53.800]   But really what became more fascinating was that chart that I had you pause at, which
[01:48:53.800 --> 01:48:59.300]   showed the company's revenue from membership and services.
[01:48:59.300 --> 01:49:03.020]   And then the second column there is the location operating expenses.
[01:49:03.020 --> 01:49:06.700]   Now this is a similar metric to what's called cost of revenue.
[01:49:06.700 --> 01:49:10.700]   And if you're not a financial person, you have revenue, cost of revenue, and then gross
[01:49:10.700 --> 01:49:11.940]   profit.
[01:49:11.940 --> 01:49:15.540]   You want to have a really low cost of revenue and a really high gross profit.
[01:49:15.540 --> 01:49:16.540]   That's margin.
[01:49:16.540 --> 01:49:17.540]   This is margin.
[01:49:17.540 --> 01:49:21.100]   This is why software revenue is so valuable because it has very, very high margins.
[01:49:21.100 --> 01:49:24.580]   If you look at the two graphs on that chart, they're really close together, which means
[01:49:24.580 --> 01:49:28.660]   there's not a lot of gross profit, which means there's not a lot of actual margin in
[01:49:28.660 --> 01:49:29.660]   the business.
[01:49:29.660 --> 01:49:33.900]   And Leo, you set up the top of the show tech IPO.
[01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:35.260]   Tech IPOs have high margins.
[01:49:35.260 --> 01:49:36.460]   This company does not.
[01:49:36.460 --> 01:49:37.940]   So they're competing in a bad space.
[01:49:37.940 --> 01:49:39.740]   They're really a real estate company.
[01:49:39.740 --> 01:49:40.740]   But they're really bad.
[01:49:40.740 --> 01:49:43.720]   Because we should mention that what rework does, in case you don't know, there's a we
[01:49:43.720 --> 01:49:46.540]   work everywhere, as they rent office space.
[01:49:46.540 --> 01:49:51.020]   And in theory, one of the reasons people are bullish about this is in theory, it's
[01:49:51.020 --> 01:49:55.700]   really as the recession hits, companies are going to not want to have like we do an expensive
[01:49:55.700 --> 01:50:00.900]   studio, they're going to want to rent office space by the day, the month, the hour.
[01:50:00.900 --> 01:50:02.660]   And so they'll do well.
[01:50:02.660 --> 01:50:05.860]   But that's the problem is that they're not exactly recession proof because they've got
[01:50:05.860 --> 01:50:09.780]   a fixed costs and they're they signed all those long term leases.
[01:50:09.780 --> 01:50:13.100]   So their costs aren't going to drop as the cost of real estate goes down.
[01:50:13.100 --> 01:50:20.420]   So there's also the problem that, for instance, they sold the we trademark to themselves.
[01:50:20.420 --> 01:50:22.300]   Yeah, for 5.9 million dollars.
[01:50:22.300 --> 01:50:28.860]   The CEO, I believe this is actually a story to the company for the trademark that he owns.
[01:50:28.860 --> 01:50:31.740]   In the old days of Silicon Valley, and by that, I mean, anything other than five years
[01:50:31.740 --> 01:50:35.820]   ago, there was an idea of aligned incentives and not taking money off the table and making
[01:50:35.820 --> 01:50:38.540]   sure the company's interests were same as the founders.
[01:50:38.540 --> 01:50:44.500]   And there seems to be a lot of contradictory financial chicanery in this S1 filing that
[01:50:44.500 --> 01:50:49.500]   is nice shocking to someone who spends a lot of time reading these kind of on the regular.
[01:50:49.500 --> 01:50:53.940]   But I do have to point out that so this is this is kind of an inflammatory piece by
[01:50:53.940 --> 01:50:55.380]   Scott Galloway.
[01:50:55.380 --> 01:50:57.100]   But funny is heck funny.
[01:50:57.100 --> 01:50:59.700]   Really enjoyed reading it.
[01:50:59.700 --> 01:51:03.420]   And by the way, once you read that, then go on because he's he's not limiting himself
[01:51:03.420 --> 01:51:04.420]   just to we work.
[01:51:04.420 --> 01:51:10.060]   He has pieces about he's just like crazy about Netflix and everything else.
[01:51:10.060 --> 01:51:12.660]   But then Ben Thompson weighs in who is a little bit more measured.
[01:51:12.660 --> 01:51:13.660]   Yes.
[01:51:13.660 --> 01:51:14.660]   Stratecary.
[01:51:14.660 --> 01:51:15.900]   And I think a very smart guy.
[01:51:15.900 --> 01:51:17.740]   I don't think Scott's any less smart.
[01:51:17.740 --> 01:51:25.380]   But one of the things that I thought was kind of interesting Ben did point out that Amazon
[01:51:25.380 --> 01:51:26.780]   has kind of done the same thing.
[01:51:26.780 --> 01:51:35.900]   You invest and you turn the profit knob down so that you can do more capital investment.
[01:51:35.900 --> 01:51:41.380]   So he says there is a bull case for we work in, you know, like AWS.
[01:51:41.380 --> 01:51:43.700]   I think this is an overly generous analogy.
[01:51:43.700 --> 01:51:45.460]   I think he's being very generous.
[01:51:45.460 --> 01:51:49.820]   I think that AWS has shown even how much younger age and ability to generate operating profit,
[01:51:49.820 --> 01:51:52.660]   which is a key profit driver at Amazon corporate itself.
[01:51:52.660 --> 01:51:56.820]   And as much as I have to love Ben and I've read Stratecary forever, I think he's being
[01:51:56.820 --> 01:51:58.420]   a bit too polite to the company.
[01:51:58.420 --> 01:52:04.740]   He also points out that we work is completely willing and very likely to skip out on those
[01:52:04.740 --> 01:52:08.340]   leases because they've created separate LLCs for each lease.
[01:52:08.340 --> 01:52:11.620]   So there's really no there's no real liability to them to skip out.
[01:52:11.620 --> 01:52:12.620]   He comes back to the slightly.
[01:52:12.620 --> 01:52:13.620]   Which is by the way, dodgy.
[01:52:13.620 --> 01:52:14.620]   I tell.
[01:52:14.620 --> 01:52:19.380]   Well, this is this is I mean, this is the same CEO has sold off some of his shares to buy
[01:52:19.380 --> 01:52:21.820]   buildings, which he then leases back to we work.
[01:52:21.820 --> 01:52:22.820]   Yep.
[01:52:22.820 --> 01:52:26.300]   You know, this is a shell game, which is sooner or later somebody's going to be left up holding
[01:52:26.300 --> 01:52:27.300]   them.
[01:52:27.300 --> 01:52:28.420]   And I speak as a we work customer.
[01:52:28.420 --> 01:52:30.740]   We are in the we work offices in San Francisco.
[01:52:30.740 --> 01:52:31.740]   Are you really?
[01:52:31.740 --> 01:52:32.740]   Yeah.
[01:52:32.740 --> 01:52:39.220]   And they are basically just an office leasing firm with some glittery bits with some glitter
[01:52:39.220 --> 01:52:40.220]   on that.
[01:52:40.220 --> 01:52:41.220]   Remember at all.
[01:52:41.220 --> 01:52:45.540]   Remember that over the course of the leases that we were currently has signed the officers,
[01:52:45.540 --> 01:52:49.620]   which includes the CEO are going to be paid $110 million.
[01:52:49.620 --> 01:52:50.620]   Yeah.
[01:52:50.620 --> 01:52:54.780]   So the CEO of the company is a landlord to the company.
[01:52:54.780 --> 01:52:56.620]   So he gets paid no matter what.
[01:52:56.620 --> 01:52:57.620]   Yeah.
[01:52:57.620 --> 01:53:00.740]   So if you're investing in this IPO, they're trying to make it seem as if you're investing
[01:53:00.740 --> 01:53:05.940]   in all this real estate, the real estate is leased and those leases are going to get
[01:53:05.940 --> 01:53:07.220]   their money no matter what.
[01:53:07.220 --> 01:53:08.220]   Yeah.
[01:53:08.220 --> 01:53:09.380]   What are you investing in?
[01:53:09.380 --> 01:53:14.300]   So both Ben and Scott come up with the same final conclusion, which is you probably shouldn't
[01:53:14.300 --> 01:53:15.300]   buy this.
[01:53:15.300 --> 01:53:16.300]   I wouldn't go.
[01:53:16.300 --> 01:53:17.300]   One more forcefully than others.
[01:53:17.300 --> 01:53:18.300]   But do you short it?
[01:53:18.300 --> 01:53:19.300]   You can't short this.
[01:53:19.300 --> 01:53:20.620]   It's a very expensive to short.
[01:53:20.620 --> 01:53:21.700]   It's going to be very high demand.
[01:53:21.700 --> 01:53:26.740]   But just to give you a kind of a sense of the scale of the unprofitability of this company.
[01:53:26.740 --> 01:53:30.380]   In the first half of 2019, they had revenue of $1.54 billion.
[01:53:30.380 --> 01:53:31.860]   Give or take.
[01:53:31.860 --> 01:53:34.820]   They had location operating expenses of $1.23.
[01:53:34.820 --> 01:53:38.740]   So that means the cost of running all those buildings was nearly their entire revenue,
[01:53:38.740 --> 01:53:42.060]   but they had expenses of a total of $2.9 billion.
[01:53:42.060 --> 01:53:46.460]   So they're operating loss in just six months was nearly $1.4 billion.
[01:53:46.460 --> 01:53:49.140]   How much money is Uber made over the last five, 10 years?
[01:53:49.140 --> 01:53:50.140]   Negative, a gillion.
[01:53:50.140 --> 01:53:51.980]   How much money is Uber lost, I should say?
[01:53:51.980 --> 01:53:52.980]   Many minutes.
[01:53:52.980 --> 01:53:55.940]   That's why there should be a merger between Rework and Uber.
[01:53:55.940 --> 01:54:00.340]   Isn't Uber still considered by many a good investment?
[01:54:00.340 --> 01:54:01.340]   No.
[01:54:01.340 --> 01:54:02.340]   No.
[01:54:02.340 --> 01:54:03.340]   It's a shell game.
[01:54:03.340 --> 01:54:07.220]   As soon as they run out of Castaburn, then we will talk about this on the way up.
[01:54:07.220 --> 01:54:08.940]   Uber has never made a profit.
[01:54:08.940 --> 01:54:13.340]   Uber will never make a profit unless autonomous vehicles go on the road.
[01:54:13.340 --> 01:54:15.860]   At some point, the money is going to run out.
[01:54:15.860 --> 01:54:20.020]   It's a question of, can you find someone stupid enough to check another $10 billion and keep
[01:54:20.020 --> 01:54:21.780]   the company coming up and down the road?
[01:54:21.780 --> 01:54:25.500]   So far, both WeWork and Uber have found people stupid enough to throw money into it.
[01:54:25.500 --> 01:54:28.580]   But there's a distinction now that really matters between the two companies.
[01:54:28.580 --> 01:54:30.620]   WeWork is still growing like heck.
[01:54:30.620 --> 01:54:34.900]   I mean, it grew over about 100% from 2018 to 2019.
[01:54:34.900 --> 01:54:38.580]   That's insane growth at the scale of revenue they're doing.
[01:54:38.580 --> 01:54:40.860]   Uber's growth has decelerated dramatically.
[01:54:40.860 --> 01:54:42.580]   So their losses are much less un...
[01:54:42.580 --> 01:54:45.220]   much more unpalatable to investors.
[01:54:45.220 --> 01:54:47.700]   If you grow fast, you can lose money.
[01:54:47.700 --> 01:54:50.500]   Uber is going to be an outgrow revenue loss.
[01:54:50.500 --> 01:54:56.180]   The idea is that over time, the percentage of revenue you lose goes down and investors
[01:54:56.180 --> 01:54:58.860]   become more kind of okay with it.
[01:54:58.860 --> 01:55:01.540]   But Uber's losses have stayed relatively sharper.
[01:55:01.540 --> 01:55:04.860]   Ultimately, investors are looking at your prospects, your long-term.
[01:55:04.860 --> 01:55:09.260]   If you don't ever make money, no investor is ever going to be happy.
[01:55:09.260 --> 01:55:13.860]   Well, the passing round, it's a game of past the puzzle.
[01:55:13.860 --> 01:55:17.220]   And sooner or later, someone's going to end up and find out there's...
[01:55:17.220 --> 01:55:18.980]   I can't say what's going to be in there.
[01:55:18.980 --> 01:55:21.300]   But I mean, it's not going to work.
[01:55:21.300 --> 01:55:25.780]   There are some VCs in San Francisco who are still bullish on Uber.
[01:55:25.780 --> 01:55:28.780]   But they tend to be the VCs who are heavily invested.
[01:55:28.780 --> 01:55:29.780]   Who have Uber?
[01:55:29.780 --> 01:55:30.780]   Yeah.
[01:55:30.780 --> 01:55:32.220]   Well, the lock-up period doesn't last forever.
[01:55:32.220 --> 01:55:33.860]   They can also exit the trade if they so desire.
[01:55:33.860 --> 01:55:37.260]   So they're a lot of great companies going public.
[01:55:37.260 --> 01:55:38.260]   It's been a lot of fun to watch.
[01:55:38.260 --> 01:55:44.420]   I think if you want to mess with your mind, go read the WeWork S1 and then write down
[01:55:44.420 --> 01:55:45.780]   the bull case and the bear case.
[01:55:45.780 --> 01:55:49.220]   You can do both pretty easily because there's so much there.
[01:55:49.220 --> 01:55:53.060]   It's kind of a Rorsh rash test or ink blot test for the FinTech world.
[01:55:53.060 --> 01:55:56.140]   Can I read a section from their IPO file?
[01:55:56.140 --> 01:55:57.620]   It's my favorite part.
[01:55:57.620 --> 01:55:58.620]   Our story.
[01:55:58.620 --> 01:55:59.620]   Our story.
[01:55:59.620 --> 01:56:02.700]   We are a community company committed to maximum global impact.
[01:56:02.700 --> 01:56:05.100]   Our mission is to elevate the world's consciousness.
[01:56:05.100 --> 01:56:09.940]   We have built a worldwide platform that supports growth, shared experiences and true success.
[01:56:09.940 --> 01:56:10.940]   Yes!
[01:56:10.940 --> 01:56:12.940]   What the hell do they do?
[01:56:12.940 --> 01:56:13.940]   Yes!
[01:56:13.940 --> 01:56:14.940]   Bro, it's energy.
[01:56:14.940 --> 01:56:15.940]   I don't know.
[01:56:15.940 --> 01:56:16.940]   Yes!
[01:56:16.940 --> 01:56:17.940]   You're looking in these offices.
[01:56:17.940 --> 01:56:18.940]   This is exactly the kind of...
[01:56:18.940 --> 01:56:19.940]   Yeah.
[01:56:19.940 --> 01:56:20.940]   You have to put up with...
[01:56:20.940 --> 01:56:21.940]   You can't swear on Twitter.
[01:56:21.940 --> 01:56:22.940]   Oh, sorry.
[01:56:22.940 --> 01:56:24.380]   You have to put up with every day.
[01:56:24.380 --> 01:56:25.380]   There's like...
[01:56:25.380 --> 01:56:30.020]   The WeWork S1 is like a communal meeting area on the ground floor and then there's tightly
[01:56:30.020 --> 01:56:32.420]   stacked round glass offices going up.
[01:56:32.420 --> 01:56:36.700]   But it's like every day they'll be like, "Oh, so and so wants to come and pitch you about
[01:56:36.700 --> 01:56:39.940]   this and come down and try a delicious quinoa smoothies."
[01:56:39.940 --> 01:56:40.940]   Oh!
[01:56:40.940 --> 01:56:41.940]   That's the choice.
[01:56:41.940 --> 01:56:42.940]   It is a dessert!
[01:56:42.940 --> 01:56:48.540]   Well, when we first moved in, we were kind of like, "Hey on, they've got free beer on tap."
[01:56:48.540 --> 01:56:52.660]   They're taking British journalists in on a lease for this.
[01:56:52.660 --> 01:56:54.500]   We're going to have some fun.
[01:56:54.500 --> 01:56:56.460]   Talk about operating margins.
[01:56:56.460 --> 01:57:00.660]   Within a month, those pumps get locked up at six o'clock every night.
[01:57:00.660 --> 01:57:04.980]   I've heard there's more cost-cutting in individual WeWork because it's like that and that's how
[01:57:04.980 --> 01:57:08.180]   they're going to drive a bit more margin and hopefully make the math a bit more clean.
[01:57:08.180 --> 01:57:10.180]   But it's also Lord of the Flies in there.
[01:57:10.180 --> 01:57:11.980]   I mean, seriously, if you...
[01:57:11.980 --> 01:57:17.540]   One of our guys put a bad review on Yelp and came of the WeWork office and one of the WeWork
[01:57:17.540 --> 01:57:21.620]   staffers came and pleaded with them to take it down because otherwise there was a risk
[01:57:21.620 --> 01:57:23.140]   that they'd all get fired.
[01:57:23.140 --> 01:57:24.140]   Wow.
[01:57:24.140 --> 01:57:26.500]   It is a really, really weird company.
[01:57:26.500 --> 01:57:30.140]   I don't like how it treats its staff and I don't like what investors are going to be
[01:57:30.140 --> 01:57:31.140]   giving.
[01:57:31.140 --> 01:57:32.140]   You're right there.
[01:57:32.140 --> 01:57:33.140]   You're on the...
[01:57:33.140 --> 01:57:36.940]   Yeah, I'm probably going to be getting pin-thumb tax on my seat tomorrow for this.
[01:57:36.940 --> 01:57:40.060]   The quote that you read though, they mint that.
[01:57:40.060 --> 01:57:41.060]   Yeah.
[01:57:41.060 --> 01:57:42.620]   That's the start of the document.
[01:57:42.620 --> 01:57:43.620]   That's the...
[01:57:43.620 --> 01:57:44.620]   Welcome to WeWork.
[01:57:44.620 --> 01:57:49.020]   This is our first salvo, you know, and they paid a lot of money for those words and then
[01:57:49.020 --> 01:57:50.020]   they published them.
[01:57:50.020 --> 01:57:51.020]   Oh, I'm sure they did.
[01:57:51.020 --> 01:57:56.020]   But I mean, look, it contains consciousness, platform, growth, experiences and success.
[01:57:56.020 --> 01:57:57.020]   How much better can it really get?
[01:57:57.020 --> 01:57:58.020]   It sounds good to me.
[01:57:58.020 --> 01:57:59.020]   Oh.
[01:57:59.020 --> 01:58:00.020]   I think it does.
[01:58:00.020 --> 01:58:02.180]   I'll take a thousand bucks worth.
[01:58:02.180 --> 01:58:05.340]   Pokemon Go becomes Pokemon No writes Kieran McCarthy.
[01:58:05.340 --> 01:58:06.340]   Oh, yes.
[01:58:06.340 --> 01:58:07.820]   Kieran pulled off a good one.
[01:58:07.820 --> 01:58:12.900]   As games Biz Niantic agrees to curb trespassing addicts, Pokemon Go has been around for three
[01:58:12.900 --> 01:58:14.180]   years.
[01:58:14.180 --> 01:58:18.900]   The problem is that it is a real world adventure, which I have played for a long time I love
[01:58:18.900 --> 01:58:23.020]   and you end up going out in the real world trying to find Pokemon, Pokey Stops, Pokey
[01:58:23.020 --> 01:58:24.020]   Gyms.
[01:58:24.020 --> 01:58:28.020]   Unfortunately, many of these things are in people's private property.
[01:58:28.020 --> 01:58:28.860]   Yeah.
[01:58:28.860 --> 01:58:33.060]   The owner of an ocean front condo writes Kieran in Florida was confused and infuriated when
[01:58:33.060 --> 01:58:38.260]   hundreds of players, quote, "acting like zombies, walking around, bumping into things,
[01:58:38.260 --> 01:58:41.900]   appeared on his property at all hours of the day or night."
[01:58:41.900 --> 01:58:45.580]   Another complaint, he had five different people ring his doorbell and ask to be allowed into
[01:58:45.580 --> 01:58:47.420]   his backyard too?
[01:58:47.420 --> 01:58:48.420]   Catch Pokemon.
[01:58:48.420 --> 01:58:49.420]   Seriously.
[01:58:49.420 --> 01:58:50.420]   Who does this?
[01:58:50.420 --> 01:58:53.780]   Particularly in Florida where you like to get shots if you're wrong on the wrong board.
[01:58:53.780 --> 01:58:56.100]   So 12 people brought a class action suit.
[01:58:56.100 --> 01:59:00.580]   The class was approved to the North California Federal Court.
[01:59:00.580 --> 01:59:03.140]   They have been, the case has been settled.
[01:59:03.140 --> 01:59:07.500]   Niantic has agreed to pay $4 million to the settle the case.
[01:59:07.500 --> 01:59:09.980]   That's $1,000 for the 12 people.
[01:59:09.980 --> 01:59:11.820]   And the lawyers get the right things.
[01:59:11.820 --> 01:59:13.620]   And millions for lawyers.
[01:59:13.620 --> 01:59:19.940]   The judge decided they requested $2,500 per person was way too high.
[01:59:19.940 --> 01:59:27.140]   The Pokemon folks and Niantic have agreed that there will be a way to remove a PokeStop
[01:59:27.140 --> 01:59:29.260]   if it's next to a single family house.
[01:59:29.260 --> 01:59:32.020]   They say they'll get it removed within 15 days.
[01:59:32.020 --> 01:59:35.140]   There's going to be a new website where you can say, "Hey, I don't want a PokeStop
[01:59:35.140 --> 01:59:36.140]   in my house."
[01:59:36.140 --> 01:59:37.980]   I've met people playing Pokemon Go.
[01:59:37.980 --> 01:59:42.960]   I met one guy, a store owner said, "Yeah, I hate it because people just congregate my
[01:59:42.960 --> 01:59:45.180]   parking lot, but they never buy anything."
[01:59:45.180 --> 01:59:47.420]   And he said, "I don't understand what's going on."
[01:59:47.420 --> 01:59:50.900]   I said, "Well, it's a gym and they're playing, they're attacking the gym."
[01:59:50.900 --> 01:59:56.780]   It will also add warnings to the game to tell players, "Be aware of your surroundings."
[01:59:56.780 --> 01:59:58.820]   And well, in public parks, close down.
[01:59:58.820 --> 02:00:02.100]   They solve this a little bit with their follow up, the Wizard's Unite, the Harry Potter follow
[02:00:02.100 --> 02:00:03.100]   up.
[02:00:03.100 --> 02:00:08.500]   Because a lot of the Poke stops on private property, there are in malls and so forth,
[02:00:08.500 --> 02:00:11.900]   close when the store that it's attached to closes.
[02:00:11.900 --> 02:00:13.980]   Which was the first time that happened, it was a shock to me.
[02:00:13.980 --> 02:00:18.420]   I'm walking around and all of a sudden all of these places are closing and you can't play
[02:00:18.420 --> 02:00:19.580]   the game.
[02:00:19.580 --> 02:00:22.300]   They inherited this problem from their previous game.
[02:00:22.300 --> 02:00:23.860]   You were a big Ingress player.
[02:00:23.860 --> 02:00:24.860]   Right.
[02:00:24.860 --> 02:00:27.860]   So, Niantic was Ingress and that's actually where they populated all the Poke stops.
[02:00:27.860 --> 02:00:30.020]   All of these points of interest come from Ingress.
[02:00:30.020 --> 02:00:31.020]   Precisely.
[02:00:31.020 --> 02:00:33.060]   And Ingress, that was actually a very common tactic.
[02:00:33.060 --> 02:00:37.420]   Like, there was a portal off the coast of California.
[02:00:37.420 --> 02:00:39.900]   You had to take it a while to go get it.
[02:00:39.900 --> 02:00:43.620]   Which was super highly prized because if you got that stop, you could make a link
[02:00:43.620 --> 02:00:47.620]   like across the Pacific Ocean that could not be broken because no one could get to the
[02:00:47.620 --> 02:00:48.620]   portal.
[02:00:48.620 --> 02:00:49.620]   Oh, it's going to get the port boat.
[02:00:49.620 --> 02:00:50.620]   Right.
[02:00:50.620 --> 02:00:52.460]   So, I mean, you can't get rid of that.
[02:00:52.460 --> 02:00:53.460]   That's part of human nature.
[02:00:53.460 --> 02:00:57.380]   They're always going to be looking to push the rules a little bit to gain an advantage.
[02:00:57.380 --> 02:00:59.540]   So how do you fix that?
[02:00:59.540 --> 02:01:03.620]   You can have a process to remove portals but people are still going to submit them.
[02:01:03.620 --> 02:01:05.180]   Is the Harry Potter game out?
[02:01:05.180 --> 02:01:06.180]   Yes.
[02:01:06.180 --> 02:01:07.180]   Is it good?
[02:01:07.180 --> 02:01:08.180]   Yes.
[02:01:08.180 --> 02:01:09.180]   Well, wow.
[02:01:09.180 --> 02:01:10.180]   Wow.
[02:01:10.180 --> 02:01:11.180]   There's a very mixed crowd reaction.
[02:01:11.180 --> 02:01:12.180]   I liked it.
[02:01:12.180 --> 02:01:15.580]   And I actually kind of stopped playing it because it doesn't go anywhere.
[02:01:15.580 --> 02:01:17.380]   Who are the Pokemon players here?
[02:01:17.380 --> 02:01:18.380]   Oh, really?
[02:01:18.380 --> 02:01:20.580]   Who are the Harry Potter players?
[02:01:20.580 --> 02:01:22.580]   Oh, see that's down and down.
[02:01:22.580 --> 02:01:23.580]   Yeah.
[02:01:23.580 --> 02:01:24.580]   Ingress?
[02:01:24.580 --> 02:01:25.580]   Oh, gold school.
[02:01:25.580 --> 02:01:26.580]   Gold school.
[02:01:26.580 --> 02:01:27.580]   He's wearing a NASA T-shirt.
[02:01:27.580 --> 02:01:29.060]   So that'll tell you something.
[02:01:29.060 --> 02:01:30.060]   So he's resistance.
[02:01:30.060 --> 02:01:31.060]   Yeah.
[02:01:31.060 --> 02:01:32.060]   Are you resistance?
[02:01:32.060 --> 02:01:33.060]   He is.
[02:01:33.060 --> 02:01:34.060]   Wow.
[02:01:34.060 --> 02:01:36.700]   I played Pokemon Go for three years.
[02:01:36.700 --> 02:01:41.140]   Got to the highest level 40 and that was my goal and I stopped.
[02:01:41.140 --> 02:01:43.060]   Because I was getting ready for Harry Potter when it came out.
[02:01:43.060 --> 02:01:44.660]   I played it assiduously.
[02:01:44.660 --> 02:01:46.820]   I played it hard for a long time.
[02:01:46.820 --> 02:01:51.500]   But it's not, I feel like, OK, I got it.
[02:01:51.500 --> 02:01:53.340]   I feel like it's grinding at this point.
[02:01:53.340 --> 02:01:57.100]   I stopped playing the location games because they're all the same now.
[02:01:57.100 --> 02:01:58.100]   Yeah, they really are.
[02:01:58.100 --> 02:02:00.980]   I think maybe Pokemon Go kind of used it up.
[02:02:00.980 --> 02:02:04.700]   The lack of good Harry Potter RPG or RTS is a crime.
[02:02:04.700 --> 02:02:05.700]   So surely.
[02:02:05.700 --> 02:02:06.700]   There's a good IP out there.
[02:02:06.700 --> 02:02:10.820]   You know, we just got the Oculus Quest and there's some really fun games, including
[02:02:10.820 --> 02:02:11.820]   Darth Vader game.
[02:02:11.820 --> 02:02:12.820]   That's fun.
[02:02:12.820 --> 02:02:13.820]   You really get to.
[02:02:13.820 --> 02:02:14.820]   Yeah.
[02:02:14.820 --> 02:02:15.820]   And I would love to see a Harry Potter game.
[02:02:15.820 --> 02:02:16.820]   That would be really fun VR.
[02:02:16.820 --> 02:02:17.820]   So much potential though.
[02:02:17.820 --> 02:02:18.820]   Yeah.
[02:02:18.820 --> 02:02:20.620]   I didn't know it was a Brit who went to a boarding school.
[02:02:20.620 --> 02:02:22.740]   I'm always very off Harry Potter.
[02:02:22.740 --> 02:02:23.740]   You don't like the Harry.
[02:02:23.740 --> 02:02:26.260]   You went to Hogwarts for crying out loud.
[02:02:26.260 --> 02:02:27.260]   OK.
[02:02:27.260 --> 02:02:28.260]   That's the main one.
[02:02:28.260 --> 02:02:29.260]   It's so unrealistic.
[02:02:29.260 --> 02:02:31.460]   A Reddited bloke at public school with two friends.
[02:02:31.460 --> 02:02:33.460]   It's never going to happen.
[02:02:33.460 --> 02:02:34.460]   Harry.
[02:02:34.460 --> 02:02:40.300]   Actually there's a class system in the UK who'd have thought it.
[02:02:40.300 --> 02:02:43.380]   So here's our public service announcement.
[02:02:43.380 --> 02:02:45.300]   Do not fall for the post.
[02:02:45.300 --> 02:02:46.620]   It keeps coming back every few years.
[02:02:46.620 --> 02:02:47.620]   Been around.
[02:02:47.620 --> 02:02:48.620]   Facebook a couple of years ago.
[02:02:48.620 --> 02:02:49.620]   Yeah.
[02:02:49.620 --> 02:02:55.340]   2016 on Facebook saying, you know, the meme is Facebook or Instagram, depending on who's
[02:02:55.340 --> 02:03:01.180]   posted it, are about to make their rule changes in which case they will own all your photos.
[02:03:01.180 --> 02:03:02.180]   Remember this?
[02:03:02.180 --> 02:03:04.420]   Didn't the former governor of Texas fall for this?
[02:03:04.420 --> 02:03:05.620]   So this is the funny thing.
[02:03:05.620 --> 02:03:12.020]   It's going around again.
[02:03:12.020 --> 02:03:15.940]   Julia Roberts, Deborah Messing, Usher, and Julianne Moore have all posted Tera Tera
[02:03:15.940 --> 02:03:22.100]   GP Henson, Beyonce's mom, and Waka Waka Flocka Flame.
[02:03:22.100 --> 02:03:25.260]   I call them Waka Flocka.
[02:03:25.260 --> 02:03:27.260]   Waka Flocka.
[02:03:27.260 --> 02:03:30.500]   Is it Waka Waka Flame?
[02:03:30.500 --> 02:03:32.580]   It's a Waka Flocka Flame.
[02:03:32.580 --> 02:03:35.020]   Is that actually a very good artist?
[02:03:35.020 --> 02:03:36.020]   They've played with Gris.
[02:03:36.020 --> 02:03:40.820]   They've played with Big Gigantic, mostly at music festivals that imbibe certain herbal
[02:03:40.820 --> 02:03:41.820]   substances.
[02:03:41.820 --> 02:03:48.540]   So Waka Flocka Flame all have posted this, but the latest one is, and I love the Buzzfeed
[02:03:48.540 --> 02:03:54.500]   News headline, "The Man in Charge of Our Nuclear Weapons Program, the Former Governor of Texas."
[02:03:54.500 --> 02:04:02.140]   And he's at the Department of Energy, the CEO, director.
[02:04:02.140 --> 02:04:03.740]   He's posted the same thing.
[02:04:03.740 --> 02:04:05.420]   I mean, oh, he really surprised us.
[02:04:05.420 --> 02:04:07.340]   His Rick Perry was talking about.
[02:04:07.340 --> 02:04:10.860]   When he was running for president, he couldn't remember the names of the departments that
[02:04:10.860 --> 02:04:11.860]   he wanted to get rid of.
[02:04:11.860 --> 02:04:14.180]   He, one of which was the Department of Energy.
[02:04:14.180 --> 02:04:15.180]   Yeah.
[02:04:15.180 --> 02:04:16.180]   He's so...
[02:04:16.180 --> 02:04:17.180]   The man has no shame and apparently no brains.
[02:04:17.180 --> 02:04:18.180]   Yeah.
[02:04:18.180 --> 02:04:21.940]   He posted on his Instagram, "Instagram does not have my permission to share photos or
[02:04:21.940 --> 02:04:22.940]   messages."
[02:04:22.940 --> 02:04:26.180]   I replied to him and I told him that Microsoft also wants to give him money.
[02:04:26.180 --> 02:04:28.060]   All he has to do is, "Oh, remember that one?
[02:04:28.060 --> 02:04:29.980]   Bill Gates wants to give you money?"
[02:04:29.980 --> 02:04:30.980]   Yeah.
[02:04:30.980 --> 02:04:31.980]   Yeah.
[02:04:31.980 --> 02:04:32.980]   But he's a grandpa.
[02:04:32.980 --> 02:04:37.540]   He's a few flying buttresses show over folk-theadroll certainly, but I mean, it's just like...
[02:04:37.540 --> 02:04:38.540]   Whoa, dude, what?
[02:04:38.540 --> 02:04:39.540]   I just repeat that.
[02:04:39.540 --> 02:04:40.540]   That was amazing.
[02:04:40.540 --> 02:04:41.540]   That was amazing.
[02:04:41.540 --> 02:04:42.540]   Buttresses.
[02:04:42.540 --> 02:04:44.540]   Buttresses of a falling...
[02:04:44.540 --> 02:04:45.540]   Short of a folk-theadroll.
[02:04:45.540 --> 02:04:46.540]   Short of a folk-theadroll.
[02:04:46.540 --> 02:04:49.580]   That's the cultured way of saying a few noodles short of a casserole.
[02:04:49.580 --> 02:04:50.580]   Right.
[02:04:50.580 --> 02:04:53.700]   That's a much more Midwestern way of saying a thank you.
[02:04:53.700 --> 02:04:54.700]   My parents are from Kansas City.
[02:04:54.700 --> 02:04:55.700]   Yeah, no.
[02:04:55.700 --> 02:04:56.700]   This is great.
[02:04:56.700 --> 02:04:57.700]   He's a few noodles short.
[02:04:57.700 --> 02:04:58.700]   Yeah, the...
[02:04:58.700 --> 02:05:00.480]   He's not the smartest tool out there.
[02:05:00.480 --> 02:05:05.820]   So it's just so public service, don't be like Beyonce's mom and the department of the
[02:05:05.820 --> 02:05:06.820]   other department of the day.
[02:05:06.820 --> 02:05:09.340]   Look, if you're using Facebook or using Instagram, they own everything.
[02:05:09.340 --> 02:05:10.340]   Right.
[02:05:10.340 --> 02:05:11.340]   Just don't worry about it.
[02:05:11.340 --> 02:05:13.860]   And it's certainly not going to do any good to post.
[02:05:13.860 --> 02:05:15.820]   No, I do not give permission.
[02:05:15.820 --> 02:05:16.820]   Right.
[02:05:16.820 --> 02:05:17.820]   Look, here's the thing.
[02:05:17.820 --> 02:05:18.820]   It's even...
[02:05:18.820 --> 02:05:19.820]   It's not even well printed out.
[02:05:19.820 --> 02:05:20.820]   It's not like it looks like a legal document.
[02:05:20.820 --> 02:05:22.820]   It looks like a nine-year-old scrawled with a Crayola.
[02:05:22.820 --> 02:05:23.820]   Yeah.
[02:05:23.820 --> 02:05:24.820]   I'm sorry, Crayon.
[02:05:24.820 --> 02:05:26.820]   We don't do brand names anymore for the Velcro incident.
[02:05:26.820 --> 02:05:27.820]   But...
[02:05:27.820 --> 02:05:28.820]   [laughter]
[02:05:28.820 --> 02:05:32.780]   It's like someone did a crumpled up little paper and then uncrumpled and then put it
[02:05:32.780 --> 02:05:33.780]   on Instagram.
[02:05:33.780 --> 02:05:38.560]   And what universe is that legally binding and is insconvent to keep a tally of whom and
[02:05:38.560 --> 02:05:40.560]   whom is not done that?
[02:05:40.560 --> 02:05:42.560]   It's almost like a Yula.
[02:05:42.560 --> 02:05:48.480]   Ladies and gentlemen, I now formally call this show dead.
[02:05:48.480 --> 02:05:49.480]   Oh.
[02:05:49.480 --> 02:05:51.160]   Wait, do you hereby order it?
[02:05:51.160 --> 02:05:53.080]   I hereby order it.
[02:05:53.080 --> 02:05:54.720]   That we will now disassemble.
[02:05:54.720 --> 02:05:57.240]   But thank you so much for being here today.
[02:05:57.240 --> 02:05:58.640]   What fun.
[02:05:58.640 --> 02:05:59.640]   This has been...
[02:05:59.640 --> 02:06:01.960]   This has been one of the best ones I've ever seen.
[02:06:01.960 --> 02:06:05.460]   This show is not a few flying buttresses short of a full cathedral by any means.
[02:06:05.460 --> 02:06:08.860]   We had every buttress we needed.
[02:06:08.860 --> 02:06:15.080]   Buttress number one, Mr. Alex Wilhelm Scream from Crunchbase News where he's editor and
[02:06:15.080 --> 02:06:16.080]   chief.
[02:06:16.080 --> 02:06:17.080]   I found her too, right?
[02:06:17.080 --> 02:06:18.080]   You put it all together.
[02:06:18.080 --> 02:06:19.080]   Yeah, I was the first person on the news team.
[02:06:19.080 --> 02:06:20.080]   Yeah.
[02:06:20.080 --> 02:06:21.080]   Great to have you.
[02:06:21.080 --> 02:06:22.080]   Congratulations.
[02:06:22.080 --> 02:06:23.080]   Thank you.
[02:06:23.080 --> 02:06:24.080]   Give him my love to Liza.
[02:06:24.080 --> 02:06:25.600]   I feel like I've been on Twitter for like all this relationship.
[02:06:25.600 --> 02:06:26.600]   Like I came on.
[02:06:26.600 --> 02:06:27.600]   You have.
[02:06:27.600 --> 02:06:28.600]   You have.
[02:06:28.600 --> 02:06:29.600]   That's...
[02:06:29.600 --> 02:06:32.040]   And now you'll be living in my childhood home.
[02:06:32.040 --> 02:06:33.840]   I just been a whole month there.
[02:06:33.840 --> 02:06:34.840]   Wait, wait.
[02:06:34.840 --> 02:06:35.840]   Oh, that's a lot of this.
[02:06:35.840 --> 02:06:37.840]   It's the weirdest thing you ever heard of in my life.
[02:06:37.840 --> 02:06:38.840]   It's going in.
[02:06:38.840 --> 02:06:39.840]   It's so creepy, but it's kind of freezing.
[02:06:39.840 --> 02:06:43.320]   You freeze Liza to the new screensavers where he's hosting.
[02:06:43.320 --> 02:06:48.040]   I meet her, the girlfriend for the first time, and she's from Providence where I grew up.
[02:06:48.040 --> 02:06:49.040]   I said, "Oh, that's great."
[02:06:49.040 --> 02:06:51.800]   She said, "Yeah, I live there and I'm going to go to med school there.
[02:06:51.800 --> 02:06:53.720]   I'm going to do my residency at the..."
[02:06:53.720 --> 02:06:55.400]   Med school Tulane residency back in Providence.
[02:06:55.400 --> 02:06:58.480]   Residency in Providence and at Brown, right?
[02:06:58.480 --> 02:07:00.240]   And I said, "Oh, that's neat."
[02:07:00.240 --> 02:07:01.240]   She said, "Where'd you live?"
[02:07:01.240 --> 02:07:03.000]   I said, "Oh, I sold her to the street."
[02:07:03.000 --> 02:07:06.880]   Now I won't say it now because that's where Alex is and we know he has stalkers.
[02:07:06.880 --> 02:07:10.040]   But I told her to the street, she said, "Oh, I live on that street.
[02:07:10.040 --> 02:07:11.440]   What number?"
[02:07:11.440 --> 02:07:16.600]   And I told her the number, she said, "That's my house."
[02:07:16.600 --> 02:07:20.040]   So I was in the bedroom and you go up the back stairs at the top of the back stairs,
[02:07:20.040 --> 02:07:21.040]   that bedroom there.
[02:07:21.040 --> 02:07:23.360]   Who's sleeping there?
[02:07:23.360 --> 02:07:25.120]   That will be future child number three.
[02:07:25.120 --> 02:07:26.120]   I lived in the nursery.
[02:07:26.120 --> 02:07:29.000]   Is this the place with all the trees that you had to trim as a kid?
[02:07:29.000 --> 02:07:30.000]   No, that was later.
[02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:31.000]   That was Santa Cruz.
[02:07:31.000 --> 02:07:34.560]   This is the place where I discovered girls.
[02:07:34.560 --> 02:07:36.040]   So be very careful.
[02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:38.520]   You didn't want to know.
[02:07:38.520 --> 02:07:40.920]   I got home in front of the window.
[02:07:40.920 --> 02:07:42.560]   Actually, that's maybe overstating it.
[02:07:42.560 --> 02:07:45.200]   Just don't use a black light in there.
[02:07:45.200 --> 02:07:47.200]   No!
[02:07:47.200 --> 02:07:49.080]   Family from the show.
[02:07:49.080 --> 02:07:54.560]   Anyway, now it seems a little creepy if I say love to you and myself.
[02:07:54.560 --> 02:07:56.680]   So just best wishes.
[02:07:56.680 --> 02:07:57.680]   Thank you, sir.
[02:07:57.680 --> 02:07:58.680]   I appreciate it.
[02:07:58.680 --> 02:08:01.960]   That's a good story, but I will just say if I do get to have kids, it'll be some irony
[02:08:01.960 --> 02:08:04.680]   if I come back on the show and there's a new Leo generator coming out.
[02:08:04.680 --> 02:08:06.400]   You got to name them Leo if you put them in my old bedroom.
[02:08:06.400 --> 02:08:09.720]   I promise you not do that.
[02:08:09.720 --> 02:08:10.720]   No, it's so great.
[02:08:10.720 --> 02:08:12.320]   And actually, you fixed up the house quite nicely.
[02:08:12.320 --> 02:08:17.280]   It was an old house that was built in 1806, which my mom and dad got for a song because
[02:08:17.280 --> 02:08:21.640]   at the time, that was a terrible neighborhood and the house was gutted.
[02:08:21.640 --> 02:08:22.960]   It was empty.
[02:08:22.960 --> 02:08:27.560]   So the Providence Restoration Society was finding these houses, buying them and selling
[02:08:27.560 --> 02:08:30.000]   them to people who committed to fixing them up.
[02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:34.440]   So we fixed it up in the style that had been built in 1806 with everything.
[02:08:34.440 --> 02:08:37.680]   And it was my mom's pride and joy, or crowning it.
[02:08:37.680 --> 02:08:39.240]   I think we changed a lot of it.
[02:08:39.240 --> 02:08:43.160]   Yeah, which is why I don't know if I want to see it because my mom's still in the area.
[02:08:43.160 --> 02:08:44.440]   She says she's got to come over for a take some time.
[02:08:44.440 --> 02:08:46.960]   When you eventually make it out, I think you fixed it up.
[02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:48.720]   I will cook for you.
[02:08:48.720 --> 02:08:51.600]   That'll make it all better.
[02:08:51.600 --> 02:08:55.040]   Ian Thompson, the register.co.uk.
[02:08:55.040 --> 02:08:57.200]   He's a news editor there.
[02:08:57.200 --> 02:08:58.880]   And it's always a pleasure to have you on.
[02:08:58.880 --> 02:09:00.720]   It's always good fun to follow up to Petaluma.
[02:09:00.720 --> 02:09:03.640]   And as long as you're not having your egg and butter festival or whatever it is.
[02:09:03.640 --> 02:09:04.640]   Butter and eggs.
[02:09:04.640 --> 02:09:05.640]   That's a march.
[02:09:05.640 --> 02:09:06.640]   That's a march.
[02:09:06.640 --> 02:09:07.640]   Stair April, stay away.
[02:09:07.640 --> 02:09:08.640]   What was the other one?
[02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:09.640]   American days?
[02:09:09.640 --> 02:09:10.640]   No, American Graffiti days.
[02:09:10.640 --> 02:09:11.640]   Yes.
[02:09:11.640 --> 02:09:12.640]   That's what we also do.
[02:09:12.640 --> 02:09:14.960]   That's because American Graffiti was filmed downtown.
[02:09:14.960 --> 02:09:18.000]   That seminal, I probably shouldn't say the word seminal, that scene.
[02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:21.440]   You just keep going to that black line.
[02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:22.440]   That scene.
[02:09:22.440 --> 02:09:25.120]   He's buying that tool here.
[02:09:25.120 --> 02:09:29.200]   Curl Fane Tax on that house.
[02:09:29.200 --> 02:09:30.760]   You put about spiritual resonance.
[02:09:30.760 --> 02:09:36.760]   That scene where they creep up behind the cop car and they put a hook on the axle.
[02:09:36.760 --> 02:09:40.760]   And then they speed by it and the cop car speeds after them and pulls the axle out.
[02:09:40.760 --> 02:09:43.960]   That was shot downtown next to the Mystic Theater and empty lot.
[02:09:43.960 --> 02:09:46.000]   They recreated every year.
[02:09:46.000 --> 02:09:47.000]   It's fun.
[02:09:47.000 --> 02:09:48.080]   the night to 'cause it like three...
[02:09:48.080 --> 02:09:49.240]   I am where that happens in the movies.
[02:09:49.240 --> 02:09:51.160]   I just like, I love watching all the cars that come down.
[02:09:51.160 --> 02:09:53.260]   All the classic cars that come in the cars.
[02:09:53.260 --> 02:09:53.960]   If you don't know what they're talking about,
[02:09:53.960 --> 02:09:57.680]   the movie came out in 1973.
[02:09:57.680 --> 02:09:59.400]   You were even, starring, I'm not even a star age.
[02:09:59.400 --> 02:10:01.840]   - I'm very young. - Started
[02:10:01.840 --> 02:10:03.200]   a dead person full of that.
[02:10:03.200 --> 02:10:05.280]   - You never saw Aaron Grapey?
[02:10:05.280 --> 02:10:06.140]   - I don't think so. - Harrison Foy.
[02:10:06.140 --> 02:10:07.160]   - Harrison Foy. - Harrison Foy.
[02:10:07.160 --> 02:10:08.800]   Became a great director.
[02:10:08.800 --> 02:10:10.380]   - Ron Howard. - Ron Howard's the kid.
[02:10:10.380 --> 02:10:12.280]   But Harrison Foy's the bad guy.
[02:10:12.280 --> 02:10:13.840]   The FonzU's in it. - Yeah, Harrison Foy's in it.
[02:10:13.840 --> 02:10:15.760]   - That was one of Harrison's movies for this film.
[02:10:15.760 --> 02:10:20.760]   And a young blonde named Suzanne Summers
[02:10:20.760 --> 02:10:24.560]   in a very minor part. - Wait, wait, what part did she have?
[02:10:24.560 --> 02:10:28.480]   - She was the blonde driving the Thunderbird slowly by.
[02:10:28.480 --> 02:10:29.720]   - I totally didn't know who was she.
[02:10:29.720 --> 02:10:31.160]   - Richard Dreyfus was an American girl.
[02:10:31.160 --> 02:10:32.520]   - He's great in it too, yeah.
[02:10:32.520 --> 02:10:34.120]   - That's really funny. - Yeah.
[02:10:34.120 --> 02:10:36.280]   - If you haven't seen it, I think you and Liza should sit
[02:10:36.280 --> 02:10:37.520]   down and watch it. - It's the second best movie
[02:10:37.520 --> 02:10:38.440]   made in that movie. - Try not to watch it
[02:10:38.440 --> 02:10:40.040]   in that bedroom at the top of the station.
[02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:41.800]   - I am just saying the second best movie.
[02:10:41.800 --> 02:10:45.000]   - First best movie made in Petaluma was "Explorers."
[02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:46.040]   - What? I don't even know that movie.
[02:10:46.040 --> 02:10:48.640]   - "Explorers." A great sci-fi film from the '80s.
[02:10:48.640 --> 02:10:50.000]   You have to look it up.
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:51.600]   The chat room knows all about it.
[02:10:51.600 --> 02:10:53.880]   - Oh, great sci-fi film. - They take it all the way to the
[02:10:53.880 --> 02:10:54.960]   eighties. - They take it all the
[02:10:54.960 --> 02:10:57.360]   musical part right and they turn it into a spacecraft.
[02:10:57.360 --> 02:11:00.280]   And it had Joaquin Phoenix, no, River Phoenix.
[02:11:00.280 --> 02:11:02.880]   Had River Phoenix and two unknowns.
[02:11:02.880 --> 02:11:03.880]   - Oh, wow. - That is
[02:11:03.880 --> 02:11:06.120]   Father Robert Ballisair, film expert.
[02:11:06.120 --> 02:11:09.720]   He is the digital Jesuit. - And when you go back to Rome.
[02:11:09.720 --> 02:11:12.920]   - September 3rd. - Oh, you get a little more time here.
[02:11:12.920 --> 02:11:15.240]   - And there they call me the flying buttress head.
[02:11:15.240 --> 02:11:17.720]   (laughing)
[02:11:17.720 --> 02:11:18.720]   - That's an unchorton version.
[02:11:18.720 --> 02:11:19.800]   - That's right, that's right.
[02:11:19.800 --> 02:11:20.640]   - Official title.
[02:11:20.640 --> 02:11:22.360]   - We do it to it every Sunday afternoon,
[02:11:22.360 --> 02:11:25.200]   about 230 Pacific, 530 Eastern.
[02:11:25.200 --> 02:11:28.040]   That's 2130 UTC or 2230.
[02:11:28.040 --> 02:11:30.960]   2130 UTC. If you wanna watch live,
[02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:32.560]   that's the only reason you need to know the exact time.
[02:11:32.560 --> 02:11:35.880]   You can do that at twit.tv/liveaudio and video there.
[02:11:35.880 --> 02:11:39.720]   You can't ask your Amazon Echo, listen to Twit Live
[02:11:39.720 --> 02:11:40.800]   and it will start playing.
[02:11:40.800 --> 02:11:42.480]   So that's the easy way to do that.
[02:11:42.480 --> 02:11:45.800]   If you're participating live, please join the chat room.
[02:11:45.800 --> 02:11:47.760]   That's kind of the interactive portion of the show
[02:11:47.760 --> 02:11:48.600]   and they're great.
[02:11:48.600 --> 02:11:50.720]   Some of our best lines today came from the chat room.
[02:11:50.720 --> 02:11:55.520]   IRC.twit.tv.
[02:11:55.520 --> 02:11:56.880]   PSChop says the title should be,
[02:11:56.880 --> 02:11:58.440]   who you calling a buttress?
[02:11:58.440 --> 02:12:00.560]   (laughing)
[02:12:00.560 --> 02:12:02.560]   And if you can't listen live or watch live,
[02:12:02.560 --> 02:12:03.720]   of course it's a podcast.
[02:12:03.720 --> 02:12:06.160]   So it's on demand, all you have to do is go to twit.tv
[02:12:06.160 --> 02:12:09.320]   our website, you can find every episode,
[02:12:09.320 --> 02:12:11.920]   all 733 episodes of this week in tech,
[02:12:11.920 --> 02:12:14.200]   as well as every other show we do.
[02:12:14.200 --> 02:12:15.040]   But the best thing to do,
[02:12:15.040 --> 02:12:16.960]   we see those buttons at the bottom of the page there.
[02:12:16.960 --> 02:12:19.440]   You click Apple Podcasts or Google Podcasts,
[02:12:19.440 --> 02:12:21.960]   Pocket Cast, Spotify, even YouTube.
[02:12:21.960 --> 02:12:23.400]   You can subscribe in that way.
[02:12:23.400 --> 02:12:24.280]   You don't even have to think about it.
[02:12:24.280 --> 02:12:25.120]   You'll just have it.
[02:12:25.120 --> 02:12:26.280]   First thing in the morning Monday
[02:12:26.280 --> 02:12:29.000]   as you head to work.
[02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:30.200]   If you wanna be in the studio audience,
[02:12:30.200 --> 02:12:31.040]   we had a great one today.
[02:12:31.040 --> 02:12:32.920]   Most of them here for the VMware conference,
[02:12:32.920 --> 02:12:34.320]   which kicks off in San Francisco.
[02:12:34.320 --> 02:12:35.360]   Enterprise people.
[02:12:35.360 --> 02:12:36.920]   Enterprise.
[02:12:36.920 --> 02:12:38.800]   Just email tickets@twit.tv.
[02:12:38.800 --> 02:12:40.680]   Would love to have you in studio.
[02:12:40.680 --> 02:12:41.520]   Was it worth it?
[02:12:41.520 --> 02:12:42.360]   Was it fun?
[02:12:42.360 --> 02:12:43.360]   I know it's long.
[02:12:43.360 --> 02:12:46.840]   And we give you the most uncomfortable cheers we can find.
[02:12:46.840 --> 02:12:48.640]   But it was okay.
[02:12:48.640 --> 02:12:51.960]   Not quite a VMware keynote, but almost, right?
[02:12:51.960 --> 02:12:53.240]   We thank you all for being here.
[02:12:53.240 --> 02:12:54.880]   And we invite you back next week.
[02:12:54.880 --> 02:12:55.920]   Another twit.

[02:13:12.240 --> 02:13:13.080]   So.
[02:13:13.080 --> 02:13:15.040]   - Wait, give it some time.
[02:13:15.040 --> 02:13:15.880]   - So that ran.
[02:13:15.880 --> 02:13:17.880]   - The outrage will start at some point.
[02:13:17.880 --> 02:13:20.600]   - The last twit that I was on was the first time on YouTube.
[02:13:20.600 --> 02:13:21.800]   The like, the comments.
[02:13:21.800 --> 02:13:23.200]   It was the first time people have been like,
[02:13:23.200 --> 02:13:24.040]   oh God, Alex is on him.
[02:13:24.040 --> 02:13:24.880]   I'm not gonna watch.
[02:13:24.880 --> 02:13:27.160]   Like finally, it broke and threw.
[02:13:27.160 --> 02:13:29.360]   It's taking years of being on the show and being just like.
[02:13:29.360 --> 02:13:30.920]   - We used to be kind of a dick.
[02:13:30.920 --> 02:13:32.960]   (laughing)
[02:13:32.960 --> 02:13:33.920]   - So title.
[02:13:33.920 --> 02:13:35.640]   That's a show title.
[02:13:35.640 --> 02:13:37.560]   - I mean, you're not wrong.
[02:13:37.560 --> 02:13:39.680]   It just hurts to hear him saying.
[02:13:39.680 --> 02:13:40.880]   (laughing)
[02:13:40.880 --> 02:13:41.720]   - You know what?
[02:13:41.720 --> 02:13:44.120]   I've always loved you from the very first time you were on.
[02:13:44.120 --> 02:13:46.920]   I thought, and that's why you keep coming back.
[02:13:46.920 --> 02:13:47.760]   We keep booking you.
[02:13:47.760 --> 02:13:48.600]   We don't book people.
[02:13:48.600 --> 02:13:49.760]   - Carsten's very patient.
