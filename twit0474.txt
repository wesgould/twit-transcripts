[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.360]   Jill Duffy for PC Magazine.
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.920]   We're gonna obviously talk a little bit
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.400]   about what happened this week
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.560]   at IFA, the new Samsung devices,
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.440]   the new Sony devices, the new Motorola devices,
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.320]   but really all anybody cares about is
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.840]   what is Apple gonna do on Tuesday?
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:18.920]   We'll talk about that too.
[00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.520]   It's all next on Twit.
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.320]   Netcast, you love.

[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.400]   And really we're going to be covering the week
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.240]   ahead's Tech News somewhat today.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.880]   This has been a big week in Berlin
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.800]   with the EFA conference and some big announcements.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.960]   And then of course, Apple gets to steal the limelight
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.800]   on Tuesday.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.560]   Let's introduce our panel starting to my left,
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.920]   Jill Duffy is here.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.160]   Great to have you back once again, Jill.
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.520]   It's been a while.
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.600]   - It's back.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.440]   I'm gonna be back.
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.280]   - Where are you?
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.480]   You're in a beautiful spot here.
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.120]   Is this your office?
[00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.760]   - This is PCMag office in New York.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.480]   Yeah, we're over on between Madison Avenue and Park Avenue.
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.320]   - Love it.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.360]   - Over in the flat iron area.
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.520]   - Gorgeous.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.960]   And just down the hall from you actually.
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:36.800]   (laughs)
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.080]   Dan Patterson, hi Dan.
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.240]   - Hey, what's going on?
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.600]   Good to see you.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.040]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.120]   We actually had to break them up.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.120]   They were in the same building
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.160]   and we actually had to separate them.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.040]   By the way, Jill, I'm sorry about the pictures
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.600]   I've been seeing on the internet of you.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.920]   I don't know how this happened.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.600]   And I'm sure that you are chagrined.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.760]   Can you show this, Chad?
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.440]   This is a shocking--
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.520]   - Oh, that's a no.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.000]   - Shocking dereliction of duty from iCloud.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.480]   And I think you should sue Apple.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.640]   No, no, I'm just kidding.
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.480]   I love that picture.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.320]   - I love Apple.
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.240]   Yeah, I think I took that.
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.360]   Wait, let's go take that.
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.520]   - That's fun.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.640]   And I wasn't searching for pictures of you, honest.
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.240]   And there he is, oh, Malek, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.240]   the guy in charge at Gigahome,
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:27.080]   one of the world's best bloggers
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.320]   and always a great guy to have on Twitter.
[00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:30.840]   It's good to see you again, um.
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:31.920]   - Good to see you.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.440]   - You're hard to get in the summer
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.840]   'cause you travel a lot during the summer, which is great.
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.120]   - I travel all the time.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.160]   I love Apple.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.240]   - Well, we're thrilled we can get you on.
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.080]   We did not intentionally,
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.160]   I did not last week talk about the fappening,
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.560]   the release of scandalous pictures
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.880]   of well-known celebrities.
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.920]   It was breaking news last Sunday.
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.760]   And frankly, I didn't want to publicize it in any way.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.160]   At this point, I don't think there's any way
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.840]   anybody doesn't know about it.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.080]   And I think there is a tech angle,
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.760]   believe it or not, to this.
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.460]   And that is the security of the cloud.
[00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.920]   And Apple especially has to be thinking very hard about this
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.560]   because on Tuesday, Tim Cook's gonna take the stage
[00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.040]   and is gonna tell everybody,
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.440]   you should let Apple store all your photos.
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.760]   That's one of the new features of iOS 8.
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.040]   And we think that you should let Apple contain all your
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.840]   credit cards and use an iPhone to make your payments.
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.280]   Apple stock tanked a little bit on Friday.
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.800]   I'm wondering if Apple has a PR problem
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.240]   and how they're gonna deal with it.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.480]   Jill, what do you think?
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.720]   - Well, first of all, I think that
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:50.680]   that's very targeted hacking of celebrity photos
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.960]   should be treated as the criminal activity than it is.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.960]   I mean, that's-- - Absolutely.
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.080]   Nobody denies that, yeah.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.080]   - Just, I mean, horrendous stuff.
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:01.600]   I think the average user needs to keep in mind
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.880]   that their own personal private photos are probably,
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.080]   you know, they might have some embarrassing photos,
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.360]   but they're not gonna lead to a hacker making money off of them
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.960]   or any kind of big headlines, right?
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.160]   So, somebody who is not a big celebrity
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.840]   is probably not gonna be a target.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.800]   Like, I feel like that's something that needs to be said,
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.760]   just as people freak out about this.
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.560]   The other thing is, you know, digital content is easy to collect,
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.040]   it's easy to find and it's easy to repurpose and reprint.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.480]   So anytime you have a digital asset,
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.320]   you've always gotta remember that it can be,
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.760]   it can be republished, reprinted and reproduced.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.840]   That said, I think that in terms of our credit cards
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.040]   and our payment systems,
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.320]   we do have fairly secure ways of handling that, right?
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.160]   And I think there are lots of other bodies
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.560]   that provide checks and balances
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.920]   to make sure that we're handling it
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.080]   in the secure and appropriate way.
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.400]   I don't know if Apple is really gonna have a PR problem.
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.920]   And the reason is, because anytime there's a big leak
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.480]   or a hack or a day to breach, people worry about it
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.200]   and then they don't change their behavior.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.160]   Like, if people were genuinely worried,
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.840]   they would have changed their behavior by now
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.360]   and they don't and they haven't, right?
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.720]   So I think this is all gonna kind of blow over.
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.480]   I don't know that it necessarily should,
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.880]   but I think it is gonna blow over
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.560]   and that people are gonna look the other way.
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:26.120]   - Well, it's interesting 'cause the same week,
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:28.800]   Home Depot had a big data breach.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.440]   About 64% of Home Depot's transactions are through credit cards.
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.560]   And the same, I think it's the same flaw
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.280]   that we've seen in other point of sales systems.
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.680]   And people aren't really talking about that
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.960]   because there's no nude photos involved.
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.800]   So I do think that, yes, you're right,
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.520]   these data breaches happen, they happen all the time,
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.440]   but this for some pretty obvious reasons,
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:54.040]   I guess has captured people's attention.
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:58.040]   And I think it is a little bit of a PR danger for Apple.
[00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.880]   Home, do you agree?
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.280]   - I think there is an element of the PR danger,
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.440]   but the reality is that we live in a world where
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:11.440]   all these companies, whether it's Apple, Target, Home Depot,
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.200]   every time a breach like this happens,
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.360]   it is a breach of trust on their part
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.840]   because we give them our information
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.640]   because as average human beings,
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.920]   you think they are gonna take care of it and they don't.
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.720]   Even though they say they are taking good care of security,
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.880]   but they don't.
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.280]   And in reality is that I'm more worried
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:37.480]   about what's happening with Target and Home Depot
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.440]   and all these organizations,
[00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:41.680]   which are leaking our personal information
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.480]   pretty much every day.
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:45.240]   Like it's not just the credit cards,
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.800]   they have a lot more other person than they have.
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:52.320]   So, you know, like Target wants people to give them
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:56.160]   their driver's licenses so that they can make sure
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:00.520]   that their identity is, when somebody uses a credit card
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:04.080]   or somebody, I mean, they want a copy of your driver's license
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:07.560]   and mistake, you couldn't protect my credit card information.
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.760]   You want to give you this?
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:09.600]   - Exactly.
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:14.600]   - And to that end, Apple can also use that as a selling point
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:18.880]   and say, look, you know, you don't have to trust Target
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.680]   or Home Depot, these amateurs trust us.
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.320]   I mean, this iCloud hack, we should also say,
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.240]   this alleged hack was not so much a hack
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.040]   as it was a phishing expedition.
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.000]   And so if anyone is vulnerable,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.080]   every cloud vendor is vulnerable to an attack
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.360]   on their brand equity, but I think that Apple
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.600]   can really turn this around and use it as a selling point
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.240]   and say, look, we understand security,
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.880]   we understand NFC and we understand payments
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:48.000]   and processing, trust us, don't trust Target.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:48.840]   - Right.
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.920]   I would have liked to see Apple be more clear
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:55.680]   and it's a apology about the whole episode.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.920]   I think what you're seeing right now is, you know,
[00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:02.600]   in the past, we used to have break-ins and robberies.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.320]   People would break into your house and take your things.
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:10.320]   And now we see the same thing happening at a larger scale,
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.920]   but a much larger scale, at a network scale
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.920]   on our digital life.
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.000]   So I think we have these break-ins
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.520]   and I think there is no protection.
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:22.760]   I don't think the people who are supposed to protect us
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.320]   actually know what they're doing.
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.440]   I definitely believe that we need,
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.640]   like they should be talking about, you know,
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:30.880]   two-factor security.
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:33.720]   They should be talking about, you know, brute force security,
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:34.560]   but they don't.
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.920]   They wait till something crazy to happen,
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.600]   to actually try and force people into that action.
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.720]   And I think that is where there is a room for improvement.
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.520]   And I'm not just saying Apple,
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:48.600]   it goes across every single company,
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.160]   whether it's a tech company or a non-tech company.
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.680]   - I think Apple has an opportunity here,
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.720]   but it's going to take some very careful parsing
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.440]   of language.
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.960]   Tim Cook already took to the Wall Street Journal.
[00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:03.040]   This is Apple's kind of house organ
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.280]   when they want to tell people something.
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:07.720]   They call, "Hey, can we give you an interview?"
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:12.720]   And said, in effect, we didn't quite apologize,
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.520]   but he came as close as you can.
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.480]   He says, "When I step back from this terrible scenario
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.800]   "that happened and say, 'What more could we have done?'
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.040]   "'I think about the awareness piece.
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:24.360]   "'I think we have a responsibility to ratchet that up.'"
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.320]   That's not really an engineering thing.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:31.960]   There's definitely some culpability on Apple's part.
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.520]   Christina Warren was on last week,
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.440]   he was wonderful at Mashable.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.840]   Did the obvious thing, she bought the Elcomsoft
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.600]   password Cracker, Cracker owned iCloud account.
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.600]   And even though she had two-factor turned on,
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.560]   was able to download her iCloud backup
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.680]   without a warning from Apple,
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.440]   this was after this all happened.
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:53.520]   And that's still the case,
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.600]   that even though Apple has two-factor,
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:58.120]   you don't need it to restore a backup.
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:59.680]   And by the way, Jonathan Jadarski,
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.880]   who's one of the security guys
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.080]   who's been critical of Apple in the past,
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.800]   looked at the data that had been downloaded
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:09.000]   and felt pretty conclusively that it was, in fact,
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.080]   in most cases, iCloud backups that the hackers got.
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.640]   That's why there was video as well as photos,
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.160]   some of the file names and folder names
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.920]   were typical of an iCloud backup restore.
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:21.520]   So, and that would make a lot of sense.
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:23.240]   It also raises the issue that even though
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.280]   what you're seeing is pictures,
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:27.280]   if somebody got my iCloud backup or your iCloud backup,
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.920]   they got a lot more than pictures, they got everything.
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:33.360]   So that could actually be even more severe
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.680]   than just the privacy invasion.
[00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:38.800]   I feel like though Apple does have an opportunity,
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:39.960]   they could step forward and say,
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:42.240]   okay, we didn't, we've done,
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.440]   we more than any company around it cares the more,
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.240]   and I can tell you all the things we've done,
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.680]   but we still got in, so we're gonna do more,
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.360]   and it's a real opportunity for Apple to step it up
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.120]   and make it a win.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.800]   But I think he has to, he can't ignore it,
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.760]   he can't, and we shall see.
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:00.160]   I mean, this is very poor timing for Apple.
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.480]   They had planned a big coming out party on Tuesday.
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.040]   - Well, I think that the point,
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:06.760]   one of the points Jill was driving towards
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:10.160]   is very correct that although this has happened,
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.760]   we are also moving into an era
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:14.480]   where this is simply part of consumer expectation
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:19.040]   and understanding that you or someone you know will be hacked.
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.560]   Things will happen to you.
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:24.200]   The degree to which you have protected your information
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:27.880]   and what type of information it is will determine
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.720]   how many people, if anyone cares,
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:32.200]   but this is just going to happen.
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.720]   - Yeah, but that doesn't reassure anybody.
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.080]   (laughs)
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.120]   - Oh, I don't know why, it's just--
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.760]   - This is usual on the internet.
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:38.840]   That's not my job.
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.320]   (laughs)
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.240]   But it is Apple's job, and I feel like
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.800]   they've really got to challenge you.
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:48.520]   This is pretty poor timing for Apple, I think.
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:49.920]   So let's, we're gonna take a break,
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:52.240]   we come back, I wanna talk about what happened this week,
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:53.480]   'cause that's normally what we talk about,
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.440]   we will also talk about what's going on.
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.600]   There's some rumors leaking out
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.880]   that that big white structure being built
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:01.160]   next to the Flint Center for Tuesday's Apple announcement
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:04.400]   is actually a fashion runway.
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.560]   You guys are, I know you're all, you know,
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.520]   all week long, Jill and Dan,
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:11.320]   you're going to Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week in New York City,
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.920]   you're very excited about the runway.
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:16.040]   Well, we're gonna have a runway in Cupertino.
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:20.720]   Yes, for the new fashion statements from Apple,
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:21.720]   we'll talk about that in a second.
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.400]   Our show today brought to you by our friends,
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.120]   it's Citrix, Citrix Go To Meeting,
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:28.120]   is the way we meet, we had them go to meeting the other day.
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.200]   In fact, anytime I have a conference call,
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.280]   I just set up a Go To Meeting
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:35.080]   because it's really easy to create a meeting
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:37.120]   with Go To Meeting, I could do it right from my email,
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.520]   you automatically get an email inviting you to the meeting.
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.240]   But the best thing about Go To Meeting is,
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.400]   yes, it's a conference call,
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.040]   in fact, you don't even have to use a phone bridge
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:45.160]   although they offer it,
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.000]   you could just use your iPads, microphone and speakers,
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.560]   or your phones, microphone speakers,
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.120]   your computers, microphone and speakers.
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.320]   But you can also turn that phone conference
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:57.000]   into an HD video conference using the camera
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.680]   on your devices and they look great,
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.840]   crystal clear HD video.
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.760]   At the same time as you're sharing your screen,
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:05.000]   so everybody's on the same page,
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.480]   it really is a multimedia extravaganza,
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.920]   it's the best way to meet,
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.440]   use whatever part of it at any time you need it
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.560]   and that's why we always start a Go To Meeting,
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.760]   a conference call with Go To Meeting
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:17.240]   'cause it's just, now I've got everything,
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.640]   every tool I need,
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:20.320]   you can even say to the person you're presenting,
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:22.400]   okay, I'm gonna let you take control,
[00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.920]   you show us your screen so you can collaborate,
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.840]   you can present together in real time,
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:28.280]   you can review documents,
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:30.560]   see each other face to face, no more travel,
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:32.640]   I know 'em, you're always on a plane,
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:33.600]   you could save some time,
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:34.560]   you just have a Go To Meeting,
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:36.840]   it's like being in person but you don't have to be.
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:39.480]   I want you to try it free right now for 30 days,
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.400]   when you visit, go to meeting.com,

[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:48.480]   I guess it's kind of a red orange now,
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.640]   start my 30 day free trial,
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:51.920]   but do use the offer code TWIT,
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.600]   so they know you saw it on Twitch
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.280]   and you'll get that 30 days, absolutely free.
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:59.280]   Go To Meeting, the next time you have a meeting,

[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:05.520]   Go To Meeting the offer code, is Twitch.
[00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:10.040]   So no trip to Berlin for you, Mr. Malek,
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:13.360]   do you like to travel but you didn't want to go to EFA, huh?
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.720]   - Yeah, you have somebody there,
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.800]   - Oh I know Gigalm does,
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:20.480]   but what EFA seems like it's more,
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.400]   I didn't hear much about EFA 10 years ago,
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.320]   it's been going on since 1924,
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.640]   suddenly it's a huge event.
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:32.280]   - I think we are more aware of more things
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:33.880]   because of the network now, right?
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:35.200]   - Right.
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:38.280]   - All these things were not news few years ago
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.680]   and now they are and rightfully so.
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.880]   I think we have a society which is in transition
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:47.520]   and all these things which we have previously ignored
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:51.080]   such as in our legislation and jurisdiction
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:54.640]   and all those things are suddenly becoming part of conversation
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:57.960]   and rightfully so because internet,
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:00.080]   you know, always mimics our real life.
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:04.560]   So why should we not be talking about all these issues?
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.640]   And I think that's why it's become a big issue.
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:09.080]   It also has, it's better timing from the point of view
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:12.760]   of manufacturers than the January CES
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:15.840]   because this fourth quarter is a big quarter
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.280]   and if you're gonna announce a new,
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:20.360]   if you're Samsung or aged, you don't think so?
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.320]   Everybody buys all year round now?
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:24.320]   - And they're all riding the coattails of Apple.
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:26.680]   I think that's what it really is.
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.400]   - It's the week before the Apple announcement,
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.400]   that's what really matters.
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.640]   - Well, I mean, that is what Apple does, right?
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.000]   They set an agenda.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:34.960]   - Yeah.
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.240]   - Well, I think it's hysterical that Apple's never said
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.680]   they're doing a watch or a wearable of any kind
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:41.440]   but everybody is so sure that they are
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:44.240]   that every company now has a watch
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.600]   and I don't think it came out of nowhere.
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.120]   I think it came out of the fact that they said,
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.800]   oh, Apple's doing one, we gotta do one, right?
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:51.560]   - Oh, I think you see it on yourself down.
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.640]   - You think they were gonna do it anyway, Jill?
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.520]   - No, I think that a lot of other companies
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:57.760]   were already doing it and that Apple said,
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.080]   like because it's not this,
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.400]   let's see if it's gonna be a trend that's taking
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:03.960]   any kind of hold and then let's do one
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.040]   once we've learned from other people's mistakes.
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:08.720]   - So you think Apple's been wise in waiting?
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:10.880]   - I do, yeah, yeah, I think they've been very wise
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:12.440]   in all of the times.
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.480]   You know, I was thinking about the announcements
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.000]   that came out of CE I saw last year
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.640]   and this whole timing of product releases and launches
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:22.160]   and it's funny because so many of the new products
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:25.400]   that I saw at CES still aren't on the market.
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.480]   Like a lot of them are trying to come out
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.680]   in that November, November, December windows
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:32.920]   so that they can have a big holiday push
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:36.000]   but I think a lot of them still aren't gonna be ready for that.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.160]   So it's funny because you have,
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.920]   especially with the onset of like Kickstarter and Indiegogo
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:42.960]   and all these crowdsourcing campaigns,
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.000]   you have a lot of companies that have an idea,
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.280]   they come up with a prototype
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:50.440]   and these images of the product that they want to develop.
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:52.240]   And then you can have two or three years
[00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:54.040]   where no product is made.
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.920]   So if that's what the small guys are doing, right?
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:58.760]   Like they're getting people excited,
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:00.000]   they're trying to get a little money,
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.560]   a little attention and Apple is just kind of quietly
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:06.480]   behind its closed curtains, working on its stuff.
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.200]   Then when it reveals, it says,
[00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.440]   we're gonna have a product ready,
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:11.440]   it's gonna be ready to buy in two weeks,
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.360]   here are all the details of it, go.
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.280]   And that's a very, very different
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:17.720]   and I think more powerful position to be in.
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:23.600]   - Well, I think if you wanted to look and see what everybody,
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:24.600]   what people could do wrong,
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.800]   we've got many, many examples now
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:30.720]   in the wearable space of things that just were bad ideas.
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:33.640]   So maybe Apple has saved a lot of money that way.
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:35.680]   We can eliminate glasses.
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:38.440]   Oh, you wore Google Glass for a while, didn't you?
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:39.840]   - We have for 20 minutes.
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:42.400]   (laughing)
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.360]   - Yo, that's about how long I wore it for.
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:46.440]   - And I got hit by a friend on my face.
[00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.680]   I said, that's not a good idea.
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.040]   - That's a good idea.
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:52.440]   - In Nina, as somebody said,
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:55.240]   Google Glass is injurious to your love life.
[00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:57.160]   - Yeah, well, if you're wearing them,
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:59.000]   you're not gonna have a love life.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:18:59.840]   - That's what I meant.
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.640]   - Yeah, yeah, it's a.
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.520]   - Even the watches are like somewhat.
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.520]   - I think so too.
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.600]   So Samsung announced a watch that is the most god awful.
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.880]   It looks like you're at under home arrest.
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:13.480]   It is huge.
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:19.560]   - Are the joint venture between Open Ceremony and Intel?
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:20.560]   Did you see that example?
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.600]   - That's weird too, that's like jewelry, right?
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:27.120]   - Yep, I would love a watch from a company
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.600]   that makes microprocessors.
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.560]   That is what I'm really looking for.
[00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:33.160]   (laughing)
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.480]   - They call it a smart bracelet.
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:40.960]   And does it, I don't even, it's like so silly
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:44.200]   that I can't even pay too much attention to it.
[00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:45.240]   But I didn't, so I didn't,
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.600]   I don't know what kind of functionality it had.
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:49.160]   Was it like a smart watch?
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:51.480]   I mean, did it even tell the time?
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:53.760]   It looked like it had stones on it.
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:56.520]   Things like that. - Crystals.
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.720]   - I don't know, I look at all these watches.
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.720]   I actually love watches, I wear watches all over.
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.640]   - Well that's what I'm asking you, you do, yes.
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.120]   - And I think, you know, most of these are like,
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:11.000]   they're quite, quite ungainly and they're pretty thick.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.960]   You know, they're like not, they're not elegant.
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:17.560]   And they are doing, trying to do too many things.
[00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:21.640]   And it's, you know, watches are basically,
[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:23.840]   you need to, there are three issues
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.800]   with all these smart watches.
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:28.120]   One is, you gotta have a great hardware,
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:30.600]   which has to be thin and have similar,
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.800]   meet the expectations of the watches we have
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:35.520]   and the analog watches we have.
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:39.040]   Number one, number two, it's a UI expectation.
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:42.520]   Like we don't quite know what we need from a smart watch.
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:47.520]   Just like, you know, at least in electronic devices
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:50.360]   we have known what we wanted from them.
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:52.680]   For instance, when I part came out,
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:56.800]   we knew exactly what we were looking for from the iPod.
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:00.800]   So when we saw the device, the hardware and the software,
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:04.120]   which was the Apple software and the UI,
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:07.560]   it made perfect sense and we wanted to own one of those.
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:09.440]   I think right now it's not very clear
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:12.360]   what these things are trying to do,
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.160]   what problems they're trying to solve.
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.880]   And hopefully we will have a better answer on Tuesday.
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:19.080]   Maybe Apple has an answer for that.
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:21.160]   But so far, whatever I have seen,
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:24.120]   I have not wanted to own a single one of them.
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:26.600]   - Well, this is what I mean by agenda setting.
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:30.240]   As consumers, we have an understanding of Apple
[00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:35.240]   as a company that has precisely targeted
[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:37.720]   certain audiences with their products.
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:39.840]   Sometimes they flop like the big red stereo
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.120]   or the big boom box they had.
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.520]   But for the most part, Apple's brand reputation
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:47.280]   is one of understanding what consumers want
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:48.520]   and how they want it.
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.920]   Everyone else can flood the market with a device
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.640]   that is kind of flailing in the cliche
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.200]   of a solution looking for a problem.
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.240]   But Apple, we trust or at least we think
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:02.480]   we have a guess that Apple really understands
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.800]   the problems that consumers have.
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:08.320]   And once they establish a product in that marketplace,
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:10.320]   the rest of the companies will play
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:12.280]   Me Too, Me Too, Me Too with products
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:15.640]   that emulate that marketplace desire.
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:18.800]   - I kind of like Jill's notion though
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:21.880]   that Apple in this case is sitting back
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:25.080]   and waiting and watching as everybody kind of throws,
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:28.080]   it throws themselves against the spears,
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.680]   trying ideas in the galaxy gear S watch,
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:33.880]   which looks like an iPhone bent around your wrist
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.320]   is one of those things.
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:36.720]   Although, I shouldn't poo poo it
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.560]   because this is one of the first watches
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:40.560]   that has its own phone built in.
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:43.000]   You don't need a phone with this watch except to update it.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.640]   You can just use this to make phone calls to,
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:49.280]   it's got 3G so it has its own interface.
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:51.600]   It's a big watch but on the other hand,
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:53.400]   it does a lot of things.
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:57.200]   - What lessons is Apple taking from these other failures?
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.160]   The Pebble, Pebble's not a failure.
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:00.760]   I would say Pebble's been very successful.
[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:02.520]   The people, I don't know why,
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:05.120]   but people seem to like the Pebble.
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:08.280]   - I think Pebble is probably the best known watch
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:10.360]   at this point and has done a good job
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:13.320]   creating like an app market for itself.
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:15.800]   And it's one about two years old with this point.
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:16.640]   - Is it that old?
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:17.640]   Yeah, it was a Kickstarter project.
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:20.800]   They raised at the time the most anybody ever raised,
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:22.240]   millions of dollars to make it.
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.560]   And it actually came out, which is kind of nice
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:25.680]   for a Kickstarter project.
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.200]   And at least two people I'm looking at
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.160]   are wearing them right in front of me right now.
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:31.400]   They're proudly raising their fist.
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:35.080]   And everybody else, is anybody wearing a smart watch
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.640]   in the, you have a pretty big audience here
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:37.680]   besides you, Chad?
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:41.360]   Nobody, nobody in the audience is wearing a smart.
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:43.120]   Wait a minute, you are in the back?
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:44.120]   Which one are you wearing?
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:46.240]   No, he says, no, I'm not, he's embarrassed.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.440]   - No, he's just waving at him.
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:49.760]   - He's just waving, hi, I'm back here.
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:50.600]   Nice to see you.
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:53.440]   - I just feel like humans, normal humans
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.000]   are not gonna wear these silly things,
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.760]   whether it's a couple or...
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:00.400]   - Apple reminds me of that Rio MP3 player
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:03.560]   before I said, you know, like people love them,
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:05.040]   but tell the iPad guy.
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:08.600]   - It's still Apple said, here's what you do.
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.360]   And that's what Apple's done traditionally, you're right.
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:11.920]   And I guess that's what your point was, Jill,
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.880]   that they waited, they watched other crappy MP3 players
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:16.760]   and then they said, no, this is how you do it.
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.120]   It's called an iPod.
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:19.680]   They watched other crappy smartphones.
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:20.800]   They said, no, this is how you do it.
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.200]   It's called an iPhone.
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:24.880]   - Well, and let's not forget that Apple did dump a bunch
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.720]   of money into a company that makes other wearables, right?
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.800]   I mean, we will see the technology,
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.960]   which is really what will be interesting, right?
[00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:34.640]   Whether they do a watch or not, or when they do a watch,
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.800]   that's less interesting than the technology
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.880]   that could potentially be getting into this,
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:43.400]   including a ton of wireless stuff, transfer stuff in NFC.
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:48.040]   And I mean, what's the one wearable people do wear
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:50.400]   and give a damn about across demographics?
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.800]   It's headphones, it's cans.
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:56.080]   And I can absolutely see something positioned,
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:58.840]   the same type of technology that would be in a watch
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:01.240]   in a number of different small wearable products,
[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:02.320]   not just one.
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:05.480]   - New York Times did a profile of Johnny Ive.
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:09.400]   I guess you could argue this is the first admission
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:12.520]   by anybody that Apple's looking at watches.
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:16.360]   Johnny Ive said Switzerland should be worried.
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:20.280]   I don't know if Johnny really thinks that Switzerland
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:23.120]   makes most watches, but apparently he says,
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:24.560]   Switzerland is in trouble.
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:28.880]   - Yeah, that's kind of a far reaching
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:30.320]   and overreaching statement.
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:31.400]   - I think so too.
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:32.520]   I'm sorry.
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:35.760]   I mean, you know, it's like, let's see what you got first
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.440]   before you, like that.
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:40.240]   I don't think you can make a boast like that.
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:43.480]   - But that's how Apple's been lately.
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.480]   - No, but they've been big talkers.
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:48.760]   - You know, and EQ said earlier this year
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:51.400]   at the Recode Conference, a code conference,
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:56.800]   we've got the best product pipeline I've seen in 25 years.
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:01.360]   Apple's been trash talking of late
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:04.040]   and I'm waiting for them to deliver.
[00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.080]   - I don't think it's trash talking,
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:07.200]   it was just like they were saying,
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.280]   they have new products coming.
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:11.480]   But I do think that saying that, you know,
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:16.080]   what he might have meant is that, you know,
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:19.160]   the swatch or the Switzerland industry
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.760]   relies on the fact that people want
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:23.880]   to put a watch on their wrist
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:26.560]   and Apple will have a product
[00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:29.000]   which will take up their real estate.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.880]   Like that, it may not be a watch,
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:32.520]   it can be something else,
[00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:36.320]   but they are going to occupy the real estate on your wrist,
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:39.560]   which is where the watch industry gets challenged.
[00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:43.480]   But I think people buy watches for a whole different reason.
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:47.000]   I mean, they're not buying it to see time.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:48.480]   That is pretty clear.
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:49.720]   - Yeah.
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:51.680]   - And so it'll be interesting to see what happens.
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:55.840]   I'm actually pretty excited about Q's day
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:59.360]   because that would also define in many ways,
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:01.920]   like, you know, the future of Apple,
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:03.880]   whether, you know, they got it
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:06.360]   or they're just full of empty words.
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.240]   - Here is the latest,
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:12.000]   the latest thing is to fly a drone over things.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:14.640]   This is the drone's eye view of the big white box
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.640]   that is being built right next to the Flint Center
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:17.480]   and Cupertino.
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:20.240]   The Flint Center is where Apple will make this announcement
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:23.040]   on Tuesday and they have been constructing now
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:26.280]   for some time this building, a fairly big building.
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:28.840]   It's almost as big as the center itself.
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:31.880]   The latest rumor is that there is a fashion runway,
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:34.640]   a fashion style catwalk.
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:38.280]   - I am too sexy for my watch, too sexy for my watch.
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:42.680]   That they will invite the journalists to,
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:46.160]   Dan, Omar, you've got to be going to the Apple event, right?
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:47.960]   - I am going to the Apple.
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:50.640]   - So either way, you should stick to your day job,
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:51.720]   no singing for you.
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:55.440]   - But I am too sexy for my watch.
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:58.200]   Are you, I think it is exciting.
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.520]   I think you're going to see something pretty big.
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:02.000]   We're sending Renee, Richie and Andy and Aco down there.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.280]   We're sending a camera crew down there.
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:06.280]   We're hoping we can get some video with them
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:07.600]   after the announcement.
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:08.960]   We'll be covering the announcement live
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:12.800]   starting at 10 a.m. Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern on Tuesday.
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:15.160]   I Justine will be joining us,
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:18.200]   Sarah Lane, Mike Elgin, Alex Lindsey.
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:19.680]   We're putting a lot, this is,
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.320]   Apple's events are always a big event for us,
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:23.160]   but I think this is maybe the biggest event
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:24.960]   since the iPad announcement.
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:26.480]   It's certainly been a long time since Apple's
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:27.520]   entered a new category.
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:29.980]   The iPad 2010 is the last time.
[00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:34.080]   And we all agree they're going to announce a wearable?
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:36.280]   - Yeah.
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:37.720]   - I think so.
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:39.560]   You won't be able to buy it.
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:42.760]   Probably not till next year, but they'll announce it.
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:45.200]   - I was sad for a big iPhone.
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.040]   - And I would too, a five and a half inch iPhone.
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:49.640]   We expect to see that a 4.7 inch iPhone,
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:51.200]   which doesn't sound big anymore,
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:52.720]   but is in fact big for Apple.
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:57.400]   Jill, do you use an iPhone or are you an Android person?
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:58.400]   - I have both.
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.000]   I have both.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.880]   It's funny, you just said that Apple hasn't really
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:05.760]   come into a new category since 2010.
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:08.080]   And I feel like that's not really that long ago.
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:09.400]   - That's four years, you know.
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:11.240]   - There was so much pressure on companies
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:12.880]   to come up with something new, new, new.
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:15.520]   People are so hungry for new stuff.
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:16.840]   And part of that makes me sad
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:18.520]   because I want to get a little bit more life
[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:20.960]   out of the existing technology that I have.
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:24.520]   I wish that or more the trend is that we would see devices
[00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:29.000]   that were made to last 10 years or even eight years,
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:29.920]   but they don't.
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:32.400]   I mean, how often do you replace a laptop?
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:33.880]   I ask people that all the time
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:35.160]   and they tell me two, three years,
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:38.720]   or as soon as they can rent it off on their taxes.
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:41.240]   So I think that there is a lot of pressure for Apple
[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:43.520]   to come into a new category to create new things,
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:46.560]   create an iPhone that is simply a different size
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:49.400]   with a smaller this and faster that.
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.600]   But there's part of me that, you know,
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:53.680]   doesn't want to buy into all that consumerism
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:55.520]   and just wants a product that works for a long time
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:58.400]   and looks good and I'd be happy owning it
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:29:59.920]   for five or six years.
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:02.600]   - Chatham's saying, "Amen, Jill, you sing it."
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:04.040]   - It's interesting.
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:06.480]   I think a lot of consumers, a lot of real work people do feel
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:07.720]   like this stuff is moving too fast.
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:11.120]   It's Wall Street and investors who want new products
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.680]   all the time, new categories.
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:15.920]   And that, 'cause that's how you enter a new category
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:18.920]   and dominate it, that's where you can really make new money.
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:21.880]   And it's pretty clear, for instance, iPad sales,
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:23.760]   tablet sales in general are kind of tailing off
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:25.840]   'cause they've saturated the market.
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:29.280]   - There is no reason to upgrade, right?
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:31.200]   A lot of stuff like-- - There isn't.
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:35.760]   - My mom uses her iPad one and she's perfectly happy with it.
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:36.720]   Everything is great.
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:39.280]   Like, you know, maybe next time I go see her,
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:42.080]   I'll take a new one, but she doesn't need one.
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:43.680]   It just works.
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:47.240]   So, you know, I have an iPad Air
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:50.240]   and I have an iPad Mini, which is the old iPad Mini,
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:51.520]   not the new one.
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:53.440]   - However do you survive?
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:56.360]   - I don't really need the new one.
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:58.360]   The iPad Air was just a gift from a friend.
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:00.040]   - I'm teasing, I'm teasing, obviously.
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:01.760]   - Oh, hi, I like-- - And by the way,
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.480]   that's killed the television industry.
[00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:06.680]   A lot of the Japanese television manufacturers
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:10.360]   are suffering, bleeding, hemorrhaging money
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:14.240]   because everybody has a TV and they tried 3D,
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:15.160]   hoping that you would say,
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:16.800]   "Oh, I got to have a new 3D TV."
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:17.880]   And nobody bought it.
[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:19.760]   Now they're trying 4K.
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:22.440]   So there is, you can see the pressure on the industry
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:23.320]   to come up with new stuff.
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:27.080]   And you can also see the natural conservatism of,
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:28.640]   I guess we've learned,
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:30.240]   we've gone through that gadget phase
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:32.360]   where we just got everything the minute it came out.
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:33.200]   We've learned.
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.040]   Who can afford that?
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:39.440]   - I do love one thing which Apple does
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:42.680]   is they actually try and move a technology
[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:43.880]   which we don't see,
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:46.680]   all the underlying technology of phones
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:49.760]   and the cameras and the processors
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:51.000]   and all those things.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.440]   They push that forward.
[00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:55.320]   And I think that is one aspect of tech.
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:58.080]   We don't quite appreciate it as much
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:01.000]   because it is hidden from the naked eye.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.480]   And I think that is the kind of progress
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:04.680]   we need more and more.
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:08.800]   So products become more useful and they last longer.
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:12.400]   Like, if you look at some of the newer iPads,
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:15.400]   they're just perfect as a replacement
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:18.240]   for your laptop.
[00:32:18.240 --> 00:32:20.560]   The software hasn't caught up to them,
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:22.000]   but the power is there.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.040]   And I think that's the thing
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:25.720]   they've done really a good job of.
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:28.320]   And now the software and the app people
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:32.520]   should think about how do they take advantage of that.
[00:32:32.520 --> 00:32:35.080]   - I'd like to see improved battery life.
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:36.240]   - Yes.
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:37.080]   - We're dying there.
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:41.000]   Motorola also announced new phones this week,
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.600]   the successor to their successful Motorola G,
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:46.160]   which is a very affordable and yet decent phone.
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:48.040]   And my favorite phone of the year,
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:50.000]   the Moto X, which didn't sell all that well,
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.800]   but I think the new one might fix some of those problems.
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:57.400]   But they also announced a Scarlett Johansson earbud
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:00.240]   that you could, the hint that you could put in your ear
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.640]   and you can talk to it.
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:03.920]   And I say Scarlett Johansson
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:04.880]   'cause it's like the earbud,
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:09.720]   very much like the earbud that they wore in her.
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:13.680]   But it's, they're not even saying the battery life
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:15.920]   on the hint, they're saying things like,
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:16.960]   well, it comes with a container,
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:19.360]   which will give it at 10 hours, three charges.
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:20.520]   I'm gathering from that.
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:22.280]   It's got three hours battery life.
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:24.040]   People are complaining about the Moto 360
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:26.360]   that it won't make it through the day.
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:29.160]   Who wants a wristwatch that dies at 6 p.m.?
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:31.360]   These are--
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:33.920]   - You know, you know that I'm all into a lot
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:36.240]   of the fitness wearables and it's really fun.
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:37.920]   I've been doing a lot of research lately
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:40.200]   about what's coming out in that market.
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.840]   And they, the people who are developing those products
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:44.600]   are really forward thinking about,
[00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:45.920]   how does it fit on your body?
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:47.240]   How can it last a long time?
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:49.040]   Because if you're running a marathon,
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:49.880]   - Right.
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:51.720]   - Or if you're getting your, on the field,
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:53.040]   you need something that's gonna last.
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:55.960]   So I've been seeing a lot of new products
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:58.160]   that are coming out that have sensors built
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:59.720]   into things that we already wear.
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:02.440]   So if you think about a watch as an accessory,
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:04.640]   but your clothing is something you have to wear regardless.
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:07.520]   So shirts that have sensors embedded in them.
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:10.520]   And then there's usually some kind of like core or a pod
[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:12.200]   that will attach to it.
[00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:13.680]   And that's where the battery is.
[00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:16.000]   That's sort of a hub of all of the information.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.400]   But the sensors themselves are just built into the clothing.
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:21.000]   And there's a lot of conductive fabrics
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:22.880]   that have been made that are now knitted
[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:26.160]   or woven into athletic wear
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:28.600]   so that they are the sensors themselves.
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:32.360]   It's just a bit of thread essentially.
[00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:35.000]   And so there's really neat ideas there too, like hats.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.920]   So bicycle helmets now that have heart rate monitors
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:41.360]   built into them, LED and audio feedback.
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:42.600]   It's just built into the helmet
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:44.000]   so that you're not adding something
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.480]   to what you're already wearing.
[00:34:45.480 --> 00:34:47.160]   And that's the kind of stuff that I think
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:49.640]   is still really in research phase.
[00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:51.920]   There will be a few products that are coming to market
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:53.320]   this year and next.
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:55.800]   But I think that's the more experimental stuff
[00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:58.720]   that I'm personally more excited about to see.
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:34:59.760]   How is it going to work?
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:02.200]   Are people interested in blending these things
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:04.400]   into their life rather than having a piece
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:05.880]   that you pop into your ear or a thing
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:07.320]   that you put onto your wrist?
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:09.520]   - Do you think, actually, you just made me think
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:12.800]   that maybe Apple, maybe there is a fashion runway
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:16.640]   and that Apple, this would be a cool and surprising thing.
[00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:17.920]   Doesn't just announce a watch,
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:20.680]   but a hub for a variety of things
[00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:22.520]   that you could put on your clothes or your head
[00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:23.880]   or your shoes and.
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:26.720]   - Yeah, I think they would have had to acquire a company.
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:28.920]   Right, like that's usually the pattern is they either,
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:31.760]   they buy a patent or they acquire a company
[00:35:31.760 --> 00:35:33.560]   that's already doing something like that.
[00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:36.160]   And I don't think to my knowledge
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:37.600]   that Apple has done that.
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:40.280]   - Well, that would be cool though.
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:41.600]   - Yeah.
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:44.240]   If they had a fashion store like an app store, right?
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:45.600]   Like they relied on other people
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:47.200]   maybe to make these components.
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:50.600]   But think of the fashion people that Apple has hired.
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:52.360]   I mean, Apple has gone out to the industry
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:57.360]   and hired everybody, Jay Blonick and Angela R.
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:36:00.760]   I mean, they've gone out and they've found these people
[00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:03.080]   who are the leaders in these areas.
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:04.440]   Couldn't they have a skunk works
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:06.560]   that nobody knows about that they've been working on this
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:09.000]   for five years and here it is.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.520]   - That would be exciting.
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:12.960]   - I'm fantasizing, I know.
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:16.120]   I'm just fantasizing.
[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:17.720]   One thing we do think they are doing
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:20.840]   is talking with American Express Nordstrom,
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:23.680]   other credit card makers to put payments,
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:25.840]   mobile payments into the iPhone 6.
[00:36:25.840 --> 00:36:27.600]   That would make sense if they are indeed putting
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:31.360]   an NFC chip in it, something Apple's avoided for a long time.
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:36.560]   This is, again, this is gonna be something
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.720]   they're gonna need to convince people,
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:39.560]   well, we're safe.
[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:42.120]   It's safe to use your iPhone as your wallet.
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:45.360]   Touch ID will help, the fingerprint sensor will help.
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:48.160]   You think that's where Apple has had a payments system?
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:52.360]   This is something, they've had Passbook for a few generations
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:53.960]   and haven't really capitalized on it.
[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:56.880]   It's just been something you put your boarding pass in.
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:36:58.800]   But now you could really use it as a wallet.
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:01.000]   Is that what they're gonna do home?
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.720]   - I wouldn't be surprised by that.
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:06.400]   It would be somewhat of a similar approach they've taken
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:11.080]   with the healthcare kind of a set of APIs
[00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:12.880]   which they're working with other developers
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:14.920]   and other companies to use.
[00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:18.840]   And I think they will do a similar approach to payments as well.
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:21.360]   I think they have an opportunity to do that
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:23.200]   and it will be actually pretty awesome
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:27.400]   if they can figure out a way to do seamless mobile payments.
[00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:33.120]   My guess is that it would be more in the OS layer
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:35.320]   and which will allow other people in--
[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:37.160]   - Third parties, just like HealthKit,
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:39.400]   to add things that plug into it.
[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:40.240]   - Yeah.
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:41.440]   - Well, that's how Passbook works now.
[00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:44.240]   If you want Delta's boarding passes in your Passbook,
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:45.600]   you have to download the Delta app
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:48.920]   and then it will see Passbook and automatically use it.
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:51.480]   - Yeah, Passbook is still working progress.
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:52.320]   - No kidding.
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:55.120]   It's kind of disappointing.
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:57.160]   - Yeah, they actually have,
[00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:00.520]   they probably will do a better job this time around
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:02.160]   with the payment stuff.
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:04.960]   So I am actually, that would actually be nice
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:06.440]   if they were able to do that.
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:09.520]   - One thing people always say when I bring this up
[00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:12.440]   is oil apple has a billion credit cards or whatever it is.
[00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:14.640]   All the people who have Apple accounts, iTunes accounts,
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:17.520]   have stored their credit cards with Apple.
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:18.560]   But I don't think, I mean,
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:22.600]   that is not an insurmountable barrier to somebody else.
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:24.840]   Anybody can get people to enter credit card numbers
[00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:26.280]   and the fact that you have them now
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:29.840]   does not necessarily give you a big advantage or does it.
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:31.560]   - I'm willing to bet--
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:32.640]   - Go ahead.
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:34.080]   - No, Dan, you go ahead.
[00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:36.840]   - I'm willing to bet that Apple has all kinds of metrics
[00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:38.640]   that can prove their audience is more valid
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:41.320]   or that their credit card holders are more valuable,
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:43.240]   more active and do spend a lot of money.
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:48.240]   And I wouldn't underestimate the value
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:51.840]   of Apple's consumers in major cities like San Francisco
[00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:54.400]   and New York, particularly in conjunction
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.760]   with relationships with POS vendors and--
[00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:58.080]   - See, that's what's gonna have to happen.
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:38:59.400]   - You could have the CVS.
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:01.160]   Well, they just made a big deal with CVS
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:03.600]   and well, allegedly with CVS and Walgreens.
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:06.840]   And that's where this will go from being something
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:08.520]   that people might be tentative of
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:11.040]   to an army of people who are buying crap
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:12.520]   when they have to check out.
[00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:14.000]   It's just a hell of a lot easier way to go.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.480]   - Have any of you ever used this touch to pay?
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.000]   I mean, you can do it at McDonald's, right?
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.240]   And Starbucks.
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:23.120]   - I've tested it with Google Wallet before.
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:25.400]   - You tested it as part of your journalistic--
[00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:27.200]   - Yeah. - But nobody,
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:28.600]   does anybody use it in real life like here?
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:29.640]   I'm gonna--
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:30.840]   - You know what I do use--
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:32.480]   - The same guys who have Pebble watches
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:34.520]   are raising their hands again.
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:36.600]   You guys are truly adopters.
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:39.520]   - That's a couple of apps that I do use regularly.
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:44.080]   And so it's usually an app that shows a QR code on your phone
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:47.360]   and the vendor has another phone that reads that QR code.
[00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:48.200]   - That's too horrible.
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:50.480]   - And I can't because I actually get discount.
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:52.000]   - That's horrible.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.280]   - I'm like a half the buy-out win.
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:55.040]   They're gonna give me a discount for using my phone.
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:55.920]   Like that's great.
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:59.320]   And I do like the idea of not having to pull out my wallet.
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:01.000]   We're not necessarily bringing my wallet.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.320]   So if I'm out, you know, I'm out walking my dog
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.320]   and I wanna pop into the pet store
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:06.960]   and I didn't bring my purse with me.
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:07.800]   Like I like--
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:08.640]   - Yeah.
[00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:11.760]   - You have to use QR codes, it's not gonna fly.
[00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:12.760]   - Oh no, no Leo.
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:15.400]   I mean, what Jill is saying is absolutely correct.
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:18.360]   It at least anecdotally in these hubs.
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:20.880]   I mean, you can stand in a Starbucks line
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:23.160]   here in Manhattan and the amount of people
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:24.640]   you see waving their phone to pay.
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:25.760]   - Oh, they do it, okay.
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:28.360]   - Oh, oh, even I remember, you know,
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:30.400]   when the big Starbucks mobile hack
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:32.040]   that happened earlier this year.
[00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:33.520]   And I remember thinking, oh, thank God,
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:35.240]   I didn't put that app on my phone.
[00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:37.160]   Nope, getting coffee that morning.
[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:39.160]   Customer after customer waving their phone.
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:41.760]   I know that this is not in maybe
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:45.640]   Carbondale or Spearfish yet, but it will be.
[00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:48.440]   It's here now and it's actively being used.
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:50.760]   Right, if people are using QR codes,
[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:53.040]   you betcha they're gonna use NFC.
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:56.000]   - But why did Square then get out of the business?
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:56.840]   Square, have they?
[00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:57.680]   - Well, I don't know.
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:40:58.720]   I mean, there's a lot of reasons
[00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:00.160]   because they had too much debt.
[00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:01.000]   I mean, there's a million--
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.920]   - It might not have to do with adoption.
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:03.760]   - Okay.
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:04.600]   - Yeah, right.
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:05.440]   I mean, there's a million reasons.
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:07.680]   It could determine it's not the business for them
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:09.440]   that have nothing to do with Apple.
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:10.280]   - Right.
[00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:13.560]   - And if any company can get a large block of consumers,
[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:15.760]   there's no way you would see this happen.
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:18.000]   I mean, Android has NFC in it.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.400]   You don't see Google making the types.
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:22.560]   I mean, I also see Google Wallet,
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:24.320]   even at the Hot Bagels around the corner
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:25.600]   from my place in Brooklyn.
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:27.600]   I see Google Wallet, I never see people
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:29.720]   using their Google Wallet thing.
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:31.400]   Apple will get people to do this,
[00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:33.760]   especially if it's on a little thing that's on your wrist
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:34.920]   and all you have to do is this,
[00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:38.760]   and then you look kind of silly, but you're paid.
[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:39.600]   You're paid.
[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:41.320]   - Well, to think about this from a different angle
[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:44.480]   for a second, the way that we handle credit cards
[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:47.040]   and money in this country is completely broken.
[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:47.880]   - That's true.
[00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:49.280]   - It's an inspare system.
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:51.080]   It's relatively easy to fix
[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:53.640]   or at least to get rid of the parts that don't work.
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:56.440]   And there's this opening now that's,
[00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:57.840]   it's ripe for innovation.
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:00.280]   And the company, I think what Dan is kind of saying is,
[00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:02.880]   the company that has the most reach is Apple
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:07.360]   because iOS devices are just still wildly popular
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:09.000]   in the US and Canada in particular.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.400]   Maybe not worldwide, but iOS is definitely
[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:13.480]   like a platform that everybody uses here.
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:14.760]   So they have a way in.
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:17.600]   And I think if we don't think about it from a point of view
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:20.600]   of like, do you want to use your smartphone to make payments
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:23.040]   and think about it instead of credit cards
[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:26.440]   or a broken system, the market is ready for construction,
[00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:28.280]   then it might make a whole lot more sense
[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:30.520]   why Apple has this opportunity right now.
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:33.840]   - Well, and Apple users are sheep
[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:36.280]   and we'll do anything Apple tells them to do.
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:37.480]   - Oh, come on, that's silly.
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:41.480]   I mean, whether they will or not, what you want.
[00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:43.520]   - I'll tell you one thing, it's a lot easier to herd
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:45.440]   Apple users than Android users.
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:46.280]   - Well, sure.
[00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:47.960]   - I'm not using past book though,
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:49.520]   I think we just established that.
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:50.360]   - Right, right.
[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:51.400]   - They didn't try.
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:52.600]   They didn't try.
[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:54.440]   Apple didn't, they put out a product
[00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:56.840]   and they didn't, wired into anything.
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:58.400]   They didn't put credit cards in it.
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:00.320]   - You need one more thing in this chain.
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:02.640]   You don't just need platforms.
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:04.640]   You need a company that can make deals
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:06.160]   and that's what Apple has really done.
[00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:07.560]   With those POS vendors,
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:10.760]   with places like American Express Visa and MasterCard,
[00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:12.400]   you need one entity.
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:15.400]   And whether or not Apple customers are sheep or not,
[00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:18.520]   I mean, Android is a platform,
[00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:21.400]   but they're not going to activate their customer base
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:24.040]   or Android is not going to make the deals.
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:24.880]   - No.
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:26.520]   - Google may, but Android is not.
[00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:28.480]   - Google has historically not been able
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:29.480]   to do those kinds of deals.
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:30.480]   - Right, exactly.
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:31.320]   So--
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:33.640]   - And Apple did, but they did it because they had Steve Jobs
[00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:35.320]   who went in there and made those deals
[00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:40.320]   and had the personal charisma to do that, to pull it off.
[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:42.600]   I don't know if Tim Cook does.
[00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:45.360]   I don't know who goes in and negotiates for Apple now.
[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:47.600]   - The most valuable company in the world,
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:49.600]   who cares if it's Steve Jobs or not?
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:50.440]   - Doesn't matter.
[00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:51.280]   - Right, it's Apple.
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:53.760]   I mean, so when Motorola comes knocking on your door,
[00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:56.560]   you go, "Yeah, maybe, well, you talk to the Biz Dev guys."
[00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:59.200]   When it's Apple, you go, "I prioritize that meeting."
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:01.680]   - Okay, yeah, that's right.
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:04.320]   When Apple asks me to meet with them, I always say yes.
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:05.160]   - I know you do.
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:06.640]   - Someday they will ask me to meet with them.
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:08.120]   (laughing)
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:09.120]   We're gonna take a break.
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:11.680]   I wanna talk about Samsung's curved screen
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:12.640]   when we come back to it.
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:14.760]   We didn't get into that at all.
[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:17.600]   The new Galaxy Note Edge.
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:20.160]   But first a word from audible.com.
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:22.440]   I am a reader once again.
[00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:24.480]   I have to say it makes me very happy.
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:27.800]   I used to love to read, but then life happens
[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:30.960]   when you get busy and who has time to read.
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:33.440]   You've got so much reading, you have to do for work
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:35.360]   and so forth, you don't get to read fiction anymore.
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:38.200]   Who has the time to sit under a tree and read a book?
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:39.720]   Well, thank goodness.
[00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:42.480]   We do have a lot of time in the car on our commutes
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:44.280]   at the gym, on the treadmill,
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:46.560]   walking the dog, doing the dishes.
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:48.320]   Wouldn't it be awesome?
[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:51.960]   Wouldn't it be awesome to be able to listen to books?
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:52.880]   That's what Audible does.
[00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:55.760]   The world's biggest bookstore of audio,
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:58.480]   books 150,000 strong and there's certain advantages
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:44:59.320]   to an audio book.
[00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:02.400]   For instance, Joan Rivers' autobiography,
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:05.480]   Diary of a Mad Diva, well, she reads it.
[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:10.480]   So that listening to Joan Rivers do her autobiography,
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:12.480]   that's gonna have a lot more,
[00:45:12.480 --> 00:45:15.480]   be more interesting than having just reading the paper,
[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:16.760]   words on the page.
[00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:18.320]   There's actually a lot of Joan Rivers,
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:21.000]   we miss her and she passed away of course this week.
[00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:26.640]   There's a lot of Joan Rivers books on Audible.com,
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:28.880]   including Men are Stupid and They Like Big Boobs,
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:31.960]   a woman's guide to beauty through plastic surgery.
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:33.200]   Very, very exciting.
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:37.280]   And Joan Rivers' performances too,
[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:38.520]   live at the London Palladium.
[00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:42.480]   I mean, there's some really neat audio content on here
[00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:44.440]   that's not just books.
[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:47.040]   I'm gonna get you two audio titles.
[00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:49.720]   I shouldn't even say books, audio titles from Audible
[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:50.560]   right now.
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:54.160]   Audible.com/Twit2, you'll be signing up
[00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:56.320]   for the Platinum account, that's the account I have.
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:57.360]   I get two books a month.
[00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:00.440]   In fact, I love the 22nd of every month.
[00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:02.480]   When my credits go from zero to two,
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:05.360]   I get so excited 'cause I get two more books.
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:06.680]   I have been using Audible,
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:08.800]   listening to Audible books since the year 2000.
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:12.160]   I have over 500 books on my Audible library
[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:13.320]   and I can listen to any of them,
[00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:17.240]   they're great Audible apps for all the phone models,
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:19.440]   iOS, Android, Windows Phone,
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:20.760]   beautiful Windows Phone app,
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:22.840]   of course, Windows and Mac too.
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:24.680]   And I listen to Audible on my Sonos,
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:26.640]   you can listen to Audible everywhere.
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:29.840]   These are some of the books I'm gonna listen to.
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:33.240]   Any minute now, I'm gonna get a little bit behind.
[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:35.440]   Whiskey Tango Foxtrot from David Schafer,
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:36.360]   which is supposed to be a great,
[00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:37.240]   are you reading that Chris?
[00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:38.080]   You like it?
[00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:39.160]   It's supposed to be,
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:41.400]   New York Times says it's the book of the summer.
[00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:45.480]   Russell Shorto's history of Dutch Manhattan.
[00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:48.160]   See, I like to mix fiction, nonfiction, fiction.
[00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:51.600]   Gone Girl, the thriller from Gillian Flynn.
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:53.560]   Thinking fast and slow,
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:55.240]   this is the guy who kind of inspired
[00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:57.480]   the whole rational, you know,
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:02.040]   free economics, the whole behavioral economics field.
[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:04.240]   He's the original Nobel laureate,
[00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:06.240]   the original behavioral psychology,
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:09.000]   behavioral economics and happiness guy,
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.920]   inspired Steven Pinker and Malcolm Gladwell.
[00:47:11.920 --> 00:47:14.360]   And I've got this as a recommendation from somebody.
[00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:16.440]   That's one of the fun things about being an Audible member.
[00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:17.760]   When Audible folks get together,
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:19.080]   they always say, what are you listening to?
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:20.120]   What do you like?
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:21.320]   What's your favorite book?
[00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:24.240]   Go to audible.com/twit and the number two,
[00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:26.960]   Twit Two and sign up for the gold account.
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:27.840]   I'm sorry, I applied to my account.
[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:30.120]   You'll get two books, two credits.
[00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:32.080]   It's free for the first 30 days, cancel anytime.
[00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:33.440]   In that first 30 days, you'll pay nothing.
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:34.880]   You do get to keep the books.
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:36.480]   You'll also get the daily digest
[00:47:36.480 --> 00:47:37.840]   of the New York Times or Wall Street Journal.
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:39.560]   So you'll keep up on current events,
[00:47:39.560 --> 00:47:41.920]   as well as listen to the great stories,
[00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:44.120]   science fiction is fabulous at Audible.
[00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:49.120]   Audible.com/twit to try it free today.
[00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:51.160]   You're gonna love it.
[00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:54.160]   So Samsung also, now somebody wrote an article,
[00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:56.200]   I thought this was actually an interesting piece,
[00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:59.400]   that Samsung, there was a failure of nerve at Samsung.
[00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:01.160]   They announced the Galaxy Note 4,
[00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:03.080]   which is just kind of like a little bit bigger,
[00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:05.680]   a little bit better Galaxy Note 3.
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:07.040]   That's as Samsung has wanted to do,
[00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:09.680]   this very slow evolutionary improvement.
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:12.480]   And then they also announced the Galaxy Note Edge,
[00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:13.880]   which is wacky.
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:16.320]   It has a screen that curves around
[00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:18.480]   the right edge of the phone.
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:20.280]   Actually, I think they're two separate screens.
[00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:22.240]   It looks like a single plate of glass,
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:24.320]   but I've been told that they're two separate screens.
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:26.080]   And so icons show up there,
[00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:27.720]   you could look at whether if you're at a meeting
[00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:31.400]   or you're at dinner and your spouse has said,
[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:33.960]   you can take out that phone, you're dead.
[00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:35.840]   You could just put the phone on the table
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:38.360]   and surreptitiously look at the edge of the screen
[00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:39.200]   and it's there.
[00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:44.160]   Is this just goofy or is there a market
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:47.160]   for the Galaxy Note Edge?
[00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:50.200]   Who wants to buy this, anybody?
[00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:51.800]   Oh, are you running out to get this?
[00:48:51.800 --> 00:48:54.920]   You're all iPhone users, you're sheep.
[00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:57.320]   - No, I use an Android phone once in a while.
[00:48:57.320 --> 00:48:58.720]   I use one plus.
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:01.000]   Do you like the idea?
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.640]   I mean, I have to, look, I admire Samsung
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:06.000]   for trying something.
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.320]   - An Android phone, you can take a look at it.
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:09.280]   - Okay, I believe you.
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:10.120]   I believe you.
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:11.320]   Oh, you got the OnePlus.
[00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:12.160]   - I do.
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:13.080]   - Do you like that?
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:15.440]   - Yeah, and I also like Nexus 5.
[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:16.280]   I mean, I'm not.
[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:18.400]   - You like cheap phones?
[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:19.600]   - No, I like good phones.
[00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:23.160]   - Yeah, no, that's my daily phone is the Nexus,
[00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:25.280]   rather than the OnePlus right now as well.
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:27.360]   Although I'm really looking at that Moto X.
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:30.680]   I love the phone that will talk back to me.
[00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:33.480]   And the new Moto X, you don't have to say,
[00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:35.800]   okay, Google now, you can say yo,
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:37.680]   Moto or whatever you want.
[00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:38.480]   You can have it say anything.
[00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:40.720]   I could say, hey, needles, I'm gonna do that.
[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:44.360]   Don't tell Jeff, I'm gonna activate my phone
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:45.480]   by saying, hey, needles.
[00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:47.440]   - Who's needles?
[00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:48.880]   - Needles is this guy who works here.
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:50.440]   We like to tease him.
[00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:53.440]   But so you could do that.
[00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:54.360]   - About innovation.
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:57.280]   I think this phone is innovation for innovation's sake.
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:58.120]   I think that's kind of--
[00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:00.480]   - You think nobody wants the edge?
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:03.840]   - I think a small number of tech-aware
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:05.720]   and early adopters are gonna want it.
[00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:07.120]   They're gonna be bored with it in a year
[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:08.560]   when something new comes out.
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:11.520]   There's a lot of products that come out,
[00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:12.440]   like we were saying before,
[00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:14.920]   you're trying to get something different out there
[00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:17.200]   because there is this hunger and this demand
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:18.520]   and this pressure on companies
[00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:20.520]   to put out something different.
[00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:22.480]   And what I think about from time to time
[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:24.360]   is video conferencing, right?
[00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:27.280]   Like 40 years ago, this was everybody's stream.
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:29.480]   We'd be able to have a phone call
[00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:31.280]   and see each other face to face
[00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:33.440]   and the whole experience in color.
[00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:34.560]   It would be amazing.
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:36.640]   What we actually want in the stay and age
[00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:38.760]   is the ability to send text messages.
[00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:39.920]   - Right. - And they are really--
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:41.440]   - We just want to snap chat, really.
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:42.760]   That's all we want. - Yeah.
[00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:45.800]   - Then, you know, SOS.
[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:47.720]   It's so simple.
[00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:49.840]   And we just have to always remember,
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:52.840]   like the thing that we can do is not necessarily
[00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:55.200]   the thing that people will want, right?
[00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:57.920]   So I think this phone in particular,
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:00.960]   the edge is another instance of tech companies
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:02.200]   showing what they can do
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:05.360]   and not necessarily tapping into something that people want.
[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:07.080]   But causes, Pella, in her chat room,
[00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:09.280]   says, "Hey, the Note 1 looked pretty goofy
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:11.440]   "when it came out at five and a half inches,"
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:12.680]   or what it actually wasn't even that big,
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:14.080]   it was 5.2 inches.
[00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:15.440]   And everybody said, "Oh, you look like you got
[00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:18.200]   "a giant candy bar against your ear or whatever."
[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:21.800]   And now, a big phone like that, no big deal at all.
[00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:23.680]   Maybe everything-- - All you think is innovation?
[00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:25.880]   No, I think it's not really innovation.
[00:51:25.880 --> 00:51:28.600]   - I think so, and I can't wait for a five and a half inch iPhone,
[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:30.720]   but I have to agree with you on the edge.
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:32.800]   Anybody wanted to defend the edge?
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:36.240]   Oh, man, no, nothing.
[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:38.920]   (laughing)
[00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:40.560]   All right, okay, I just,
[00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:42.720]   I wanna give Samsung a little credit.
[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:44.800]   They're big enough that they can just try anything, right?
[00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:46.920]   And hope that something sticks.
[00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:49.520]   - They're all waiting for somebody to copy, you know?
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:50.760]   - They're waiting for Apple.
[00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:52.080]   - Yeah, they're waiting.
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:53.480]   - I just like-- - I want to be expected
[00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:55.160]   to be come up, how can we be expected to come up
[00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:57.960]   with a new idea for a phone if Apple just releases one a year?
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:52:00.900]   What's, they're, get to work Apple.
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:04.960]   TechCrunch did have a story, I thought this was interesting,
[00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:07.600]   that Apple is cranking out so many new iPhones,
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:10.200]   so many iPhone sixes right now,
[00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:13.920]   that in fact other phones from other manufacturers
[00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:15.160]   are being delayed.
[00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:20.160]   All of China now is basically making iPhones as fast as they can.
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:25.200]   Apple shipments via FedEx and UPS said to be incredibly high
[00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:28.080]   for the holiday quarter, pointing to it,
[00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:31.400]   this is Matthew Panzerino writing in TechCrunch,
[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:33.440]   pointing to a massive number of iPhones.
[00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:39.200]   Logistics exec John Martin told Business Week
[00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:42.240]   that when Apple, and this was a couple of years ago,
[00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:45.960]   but when Apple ramped something like this out, up, you can't,
[00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:48.640]   there's no one, there's not any air in the room
[00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:49.800]   for anybody else.
[00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:54.520]   Nothing to say.
[00:52:54.520 --> 00:52:56.280]   - Yeah, that's for-- - Agenda setting.
[00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:59.280]   It's a agenda setting. - Billions of dollars
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:00.720]   allow you to do that.
[00:53:00.720 --> 00:53:03.360]   - They buy capacity, they buy production
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:08.080]   and they buy logistic, supply chain, they buy it out.
[00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:10.560]   And I think that's what smart companies do
[00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:11.760]   if they have a lot of money,
[00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:15.520]   as they putting their cash asset to most use.
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:17.280]   - Do you think, though, so this isn't a question,
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:21.360]   the Moto 360, the first round Android Wear watch,
[00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:24.360]   sold out within hours of it being made available
[00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:27.680]   at Best Buy, online at Google and everywhere else.
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:31.240]   Is that a case of them just not making enough?
[00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:33.360]   Or is that really incredible demand?
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:34.760]   What's the story there?
[00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:36.480]   - How many definition of terms?
[00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:38.640]   - Go ahead.
[00:53:38.640 --> 00:53:40.160]   - How many units do they sell?
[00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:41.720]   - Well, they don't say, we don't know.
[00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:43.920]   - Exactly, so a thousand units came out
[00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:45.280]   and it sold out. - Right.
[00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:47.720]   - Definition, right?
[00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:50.480]   I mean, we have no way to contextualize something like this.
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:51.480]   - Right. - I can only speculate
[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:54.800]   because all of this is PR, spin.
[00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:57.120]   - Mark Gurman, who has been very right on,
[00:53:57.120 --> 00:54:02.120]   a 20-year-old journalist at 9-5 Mac,
[00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:04.120]   says Apple's wearable, whatever it is,
[00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:07.200]   will run third-party apps that big developers
[00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:10.400]   like Facebook have already received an SDK.
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:11.640]   That's not unusual.
[00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:14.880]   Apple likes to show off apps at the reveal
[00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:17.360]   and even if the iWatch isn't available,
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:21.560]   Tuesday, they would like to show it at working.
[00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:23.680]   Do you think, actually, Om, do you think,
[00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:25.240]   some have said you're not gonna see an iWatch,
[00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:26.240]   they're just gonna talk about it.
[00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:28.520]   Do you think you'll actually see a product?
[00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:31.520]   - Yeah, we are pretty sure we'll see some kind of a product,
[00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:33.800]   whether it'll be available for sale
[00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:35.160]   is a whole different story.
[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:36.080]   - Yeah.
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:38.560]   - I think it's probably gonna be a little delayed.
[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:40.080]   - You can almost look at, I mean,
[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:41.760]   what Om just said a moment ago
[00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:43.960]   about the supply chain is so crucial, right?
[00:54:43.960 --> 00:54:46.200]   Let's rewind the clock to a couple years ago
[00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:48.440]   when Adrian Chen got that iPhone 4.
[00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:50.280]   You remember what a big deal that was
[00:54:50.280 --> 00:54:52.960]   just seeing the casing, the body ahead of time, right?
[00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:54.640]   It was a huge story.
[00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:55.800]   Fast forward a couple of years
[00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:59.120]   and of course, the supply chain with the advent of smartphones,
[00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:01.920]   the supply chain will get a little,
[00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:03.160]   there will be more leaks
[00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:05.400]   if there is an actual product in that chain.
[00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:09.160]   If there was an actual watch that was coming out this week,
[00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:11.360]   we would have seen more leaks
[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:14.320]   and more information would be available.
[00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:17.240]   So, I mean, just the fact that we've seen iPhone casing
[00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:20.840]   will can almost, we can almost guess with some certainty
[00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:23.240]   that, okay, we will probably see an iPhone
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:25.120]   within the next two to three weeks.
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:28.000]   We will not see for sale
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.640]   and this wearable watch thing in the jig.
[00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:40.040]   - Yeah, I feel like, not only would we have seen leaks,
[00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:43.080]   I feel like also this is pretty common for Apple
[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:46.280]   when the iPhone came out, it was six months
[00:55:46.280 --> 00:55:48.440]   from the announce to the release.
[00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:50.760]   When the iPad came out, it was, what, how many months?
[00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:52.320]   Three or four months.
[00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:54.640]   It's pretty typical when you have a brand new category
[00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:56.840]   that you can pre-announce this
[00:55:56.840 --> 00:56:00.120]   and it's gonna take a little while to get to market.
[00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:02.080]   So, I think we can plan on that.
[00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:04.320]   - I think we should just be happy
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:05.920]   that there are new iPhones coming out.
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:08.400]   My phone is so broken right now.
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:10.880]   - But don't you love your OnePlus One?
[00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:12.600]   - I do like OnePlus One.
[00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:13.760]   - But you want iPhone?
[00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:15.760]   You know, I have to admit, if they, I have to admit,
[00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:18.600]   I'm kind of, I'm salivating for a new iPhone too.
[00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:19.560]   How do they do that?
[00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:22.280]   It's really amazing.
[00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:25.600]   - It's like good marketing.
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:28.320]   All right, we're gonna, let's take a break.
[00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:30.480]   We'll come back, there is more to talk about,
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:33.480]   I'm not gonna talk about phones anymore, I'm bored.
[00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:35.920]   We'll see what happens on Tuesday, everything else.
[00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:38.920]   Everything that has happened before is a wash
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:41.480]   when Apple announces Tuesday, right?
[00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:43.080]   Doesn't matter anymore.
[00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:46.480]   Apple's already here, Apple's owns this space.
[00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:48.120]   Is that right?
[00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:50.040]   - Maybe. - Maybe.
[00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:51.800]   Could Apple, could Apple really stumble?
[00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:54.040]   I mean, could it happen that on Tuesday,
[00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:58.000]   we look at it and we go, oh wow, that wasn't good?
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:02.640]   No, not because they're so great, but it's just,
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:04.160]   it's a machine.
[00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:06.640]   - Yeah, I mean, you know, things do go wrong with companies.
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:11.640]   You know, it's not like, you know, they're invincible.
[00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:14.600]   I mean, things can and may go wrong with me.
[00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:15.600]   - Right.
[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:17.440]   What a better story that would be.
[00:57:17.440 --> 00:57:19.000]   (laughing)
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:19.840]   Sorry?
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:21.280]   - I'm not rooting for anything. - Better story.
[00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:22.280]   - You go wrong, but you're right,
[00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:25.280]   it would be a lot more interesting if Apple announced,
[00:57:25.280 --> 00:57:28.280]   you know, something like the, like that horrible watch
[00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:31.760]   that Samsung announced and we all looked at it and said,
[00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:34.360]   wow, we've been waiting for years for that?
[00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:36.840]   What if it's a TV?
[00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:40.200]   Come on, that's funny.
[00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:41.760]   - Wouldn't that be funny?
[00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:42.920]   And Apple TV.
[00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:45.080]   - What's wrong with that?
[00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:46.280]   - Oh, come on. - Nothing's wrong.
[00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:47.800]   It would be amazing, but you know,
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:50.480]   our speculative heads are in a different world.
[00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:52.960]   - Everybody would have to rewrite all the articles
[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:54.840]   they've already written.
[00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:55.680]   Talk, talk.
[00:57:55.680 --> 00:57:57.280]   - That was actually quite funny.
[00:57:57.280 --> 00:57:58.280]   (laughing)
[00:57:58.280 --> 00:57:59.360]   - Oh my God. - I'm not saying it,
[00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:00.200]   be hilarious.
[00:58:00.200 --> 00:58:02.160]   - You'd be running out of the-- - We were running out of the--
[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:04.280]   - You'd be seeing people running out of the Flint Center
[00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:06.800]   running to refile.
[00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:08.640]   That article, I guess, he's wrong.
[00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:11.400]   - We had the exact same conversation a year ago
[00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:13.480]   and two years ago and three, is it right?
[00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:15.600]   It would just be awesome if Apple was like,
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:18.360]   we are releasing a snack basket.
[00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:19.880]   - Anything, good cheese.
[00:58:19.880 --> 00:58:20.760]   - Anything.
[00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:22.720]   At this point, something unexpected would be great.
[00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:26.160]   - It's placed in-- - One more thing, pants.
[00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:27.800]   We're gonna, everybody's gonna be wearing
[00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:29.880]   Apple jumpsuits from now on.
[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:33.480]   Chris likes that.
[00:58:33.480 --> 00:58:34.880]   Our show today brought to you by Gazelle.
[00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:37.320]   You know who's really capitalizing on a new iPhone?
[00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:40.800]   Gazelle, because they will buy your old iPhone
[00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:43.240]   and the key on this is to lock in the price.
[00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:45.120]   I know, everybody knows what Apple's gonna announce
[00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:45.960]   on Tuesday.
[00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:48.120]   I don't care, the price for the old iPhone
[00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:50.040]   goes down the minute they announce.
[00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:51.680]   So what you do now, and you don't,
[00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:53.560]   this is no commitment on your part,
[00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:55.920]   you go to Gazelle.com and you get a quote
[00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:57.160]   for your old iPhone.
[00:58:57.160 --> 00:59:00.160]   And you're locked in now for, not just for 30 days,
[00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:02.360]   that's their, they always lock in for 30 days.
[00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:04.240]   You're locked in that October 10th,
[00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:05.800]   'cause they know it might be hard to get,
[00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:07.000]   it might take you a while to get it,
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.040]   it might take you a while to move your date over,
[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:10.360]   you may not be convinced, whatever.
[00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:14.120]   You've now got, like, well, actually,
[00:59:14.120 --> 00:59:16.440]   October 10th is in much more than 30 days,
[00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:18.200]   but they've been doing this for a couple of weeks.
[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:20.760]   That's gonna give you some time.
[00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:24.080]   And you'll get top dollar for your old iPhone.
[00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:26.000]   Let's say you bought last year,
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:29.360]   you bought an iPhone 5S last year,
[00:59:29.360 --> 00:59:31.960]   and now you're thinking, oh man, what did I do?
[00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:34.600]   I want this new iPhone 6.
[00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:35.880]   Is it in good condition?
[00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:37.520]   Yes, it's in good condition.
[00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:38.600]   Look at that.
[00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:42.200]   $295 if you unlock it, they teach you how to unlock it.
[00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:47.200]   If you don't wanna take the trouble, $270 on an AT&T locked iPhone,
[00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:49.840]   that's a 5S, that's a great deal.
[00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:50.720]   That's a great deal.
[00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:53.200]   Now here's the deal, you have till the 10th,
[00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:54.960]   you don't have to commit, just you're getting the quote,
[00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:56.120]   I got the quote.
[00:59:56.120 --> 00:59:57.960]   If you decide to commit, you press the button,
[00:59:57.960 --> 01:00:01.480]   you check out, they'll send you a box prepaid postage,
[01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:03.880]   they'll turn it around fast, if you forget to wipe the data,
[01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:06.240]   they will wipe it for you, and then send you a check,
[01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:08.440]   a PayPal credit or an Amazon gift card.
[01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:10.240]   If you like Amazon, that's a great deal,
[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:12.360]   'cause they bump that up 5%.
[01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:15.800]   And the beauty part of all of this is,
[01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:17.640]   you can throw other things in this box,
[01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:20.040]   by the time you're done, you've got thousands of dollars
[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:21.400]   sitting in that gadget drawer,
[01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:23.720]   you have not capitalized on.
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:26.320]   Don't just start with the iPhone, but don't stop.
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:30.440]   They will buy old Surface Computers, Apple Macs, MacBooks,
[01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:32.040]   they'll buy Google Nexus stuff,
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:37.040]   they'll buy Samsung phones, the Samsung tablets,
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:42.360]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E, cash is awaiting for your gadgets from Gazelle.
[01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:48.120]   To date, they have sent out $170 million
[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:51.120]   to over one million customers,
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:54.320]   lots of happy people with cash in their pockets.
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:55.680]   Thanks to Gazelle.
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:59.720]   Andrew Kay, did you,
[01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:00.840]   did any of you know Andrew Kay?
[01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:01.720]   I didn't know Andrew Kay,
[01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:04.800]   he created the KPro Computer Past Away this week,
[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:06.200]   at the age of 95,
[01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:09.040]   I do remember the KPro very well,
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.840]   we all wanted one, but this is kind of a bit
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:15.840]   of computer history because this was a CPM machine,
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:21.440]   that came with WordStar for $1,700 and 95 cents,
[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:24.280]   this was the competition for the Osborne one.
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:26.520]   Oh, and do you remember the KPro?
[01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:28.120]   I actually don't.
[01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:30.280]   Yeah, nobody's as old as me.
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:32.680]   He meant to that.
[01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:35.160]   (laughing)
[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:36.840]   I remember this very well.
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:39.640]   We actually have an Osborne one somewhere in the studio,
[01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:45.560]   but the KPro was, Arthur C. Clark wrote 2010 Odyssey Two on it.
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:49.440]   Steve Case bought one as his first computer.
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:50.680]   You may know the name St. Case
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:53.800]   'cause he was the founder of America online.
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:58.520]   It was a really exciting computer
[01:01:58.520 --> 01:02:00.960]   and I'm just boring everybody to death.
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:02.760]   Andrew Kay, the creator of the KPro,
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:04.080]   I wanted to give him a tip of the hat
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:06.200]   'cause he really did create something
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:07.080]   that people really wanted.
[01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:12.080]   Look at this, this was a portable computing looked like in 1986.
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:13.960]   That keyboard is so awesome.
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:16.480]   (laughing)
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:19.320]   You fold it up, the keyboard went on the,
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:21.080]   clipped onto the front of it.
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:23.080]   Thing is the Osborne had this little tiny screen,
[01:02:23.080 --> 01:02:24.800]   this had like a nine inch screen.
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:26.760]   Oh, wow!
[01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:28.000]   Blows your mind, see that?
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.040]   Two floppies, not one, two floppies.
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:32.360]   Now how much would you pay?
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:33.520]   I'd say no.
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:36.760]   Yeah, this is the Galaxy Note of the '80s.
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:42.760]   I just, I can't believe I'm working with people so young
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:44.520]   that they look at that and get, and they just go,
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:45.680]   I don't understand what that is.
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:46.960]   Oh, that's nonsense.
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:49.320]   (laughing)
[01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:52.280]   That is a cruel thing to say about KPro.
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:54.160]   That is Galaxy Note.
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:58.880]   That, well, they called them luggables
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:02.440]   'cause they were heavy, they were like 15 pounds.
[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:03.840]   That's why Apple won.
[01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:05.520]   Yeah, maybe.
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:07.320]   Maybe.
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:08.160]   Even if you see the old Apple,
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:10.320]   they were not all that great-looking.
[01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:12.880]   No, no, I remember those in about the same time,
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:14.680]   mid-80s and in school.
[01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:16.920]   Those little Apple, what were they?
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:19.480]   They still, my kid, when they,
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:21.040]   my kids went to kindergarten 20 years ago,
[01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:22.800]   they still had Apple twos in the kindergarten,
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:23.640]   like eight of them.
[01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:24.480]   Yeah, two of them.
[01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:25.320]   They're playing Oregon Trail.
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:26.160]   Did you play Oregon Trail?
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:27.000]   Yeah.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.320]   Oh yeah.
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:29.160]   Right.
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:32.080]   Kids today.
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:33.120]   I think this is interesting.
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:35.560]   A lot of people tweeted me when this happened.
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:37.480]   Twitpick is shutting down.
[01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:39.840]   In the early days of Twitter,
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:42.880]   Twitpick was how you shared photos on Twitter.
[01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:44.040]   You'd upload them to Twitpick,
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:45.400]   put a link in your tweet.
[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:48.720]   I never liked them much 'cause I had that word,
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:52.760]   Twit in there kind of stepped on my brand,
[01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:54.840]   but what am I gonna do about it?
[01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:56.000]   There's nothing I can do about it.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:56.840]   Couple of years ago,
[01:03:56.840 --> 01:04:01.040]   Twitter trademarked the word, tweet,
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:03.720]   and invited all of the third party developers
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:06.600]   making stuff for Twitter not to use Twit,
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:10.280]   but to use tweet if they had called themselves Twitpick.
[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:11.320]   Twitter wouldn't have mine.
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:13.120]   Apparently, a few weeks ago,
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:16.600]   Twitter contacted Twitpick and said,
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:18.920]   "You must abandon your trademark application."
[01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:21.960]   They had applied for a trademark in 2009 for Twitpick.
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:25.440]   And if you don't, they're not gonna sue 'em,
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:27.080]   but we're gonna cut you off from the API,
[01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:29.240]   which basically puts them out of business.
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:32.080]   If you can't post pictures on Twitter, well, there's no good.
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:35.240]   Remember, Twitter has its own photo service now
[01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:36.720]   and really doesn't want people to use
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:38.760]   third party photo service.
[01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:41.960]   Twitpick said, "Oh, screw it," and they're shutting down.
[01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:46.040]   - I don't know if that is actually entirely true.
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:49.840]   That it's not complete full disclosure here on part of--
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:52.360]   - They probably were gonna fold anyway, right?
[01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:55.000]   - Yeah, and I think you can change your name
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:55.840]   to something else.
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:05:00.120]   I mean, it's not like the reason people use them
[01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:02.800]   because they were a Twitpick, you know?
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:06.280]   - And I'm willing to bet that Twitter did not strong on them.
[01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:08.520]   I mean, this sounds like when you own a trademark,
[01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:10.200]   you have to defend your trademark
[01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:13.760]   and you have to send letters that say,
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:16.640]   "Do this," or you will face some sort of action.
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:18.160]   I can't imagine Twitter saying,
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:20.960]   "This Twitpick, man, they've been a thorn in our side
[01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:21.960]   since day one."
[01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:25.080]   - But the Twitpick has been around for like four years.
[01:05:25.080 --> 01:05:27.520]   - They have been, but they're no competitive threat to Twitter.
[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:29.480]   I'm sure that Twitter's attorneys were just saying,
[01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:30.720]   "We have to defend our trademark.
[01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:31.680]   This is in, like you said."
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:34.880]   I think this was like 2009 when they trademarked Twit
[01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:37.880]   and it became a capital word, you know?
[01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:41.200]   This has been almost exactly right.
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:45.360]   This is not just because Twitter was defending their trademark
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:49.200]   and the bogeyman of Twitter, we have to shut down.
[01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:54.200]   This is a nice spin on some backroom machinations.
[01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:59.680]   They actually have usage guidelines on Twitter's website
[01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:02.680]   for how you can use Twitter's trademark safely
[01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:07.280]   and a recommendation to use Twit, not Twit.
[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:10.640]   I always flatter myself that they did that to protect us,
[01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:13.120]   but probably not.
[01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:16.320]   Number of people said,
[01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:18.560]   "If Twitpick's been put out of business by Twitter,
[01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:19.880]   can Twit be far behind?"
[01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:21.040]   I would like to reassure you
[01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:24.520]   that Twit trademark predates Twitter.
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:27.040]   In fact, we're older than Twitter who've been around longer
[01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:31.920]   and we have our trademark for a year before Twitter even existed.
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:34.680]   So no, they're not gonna go after us.
[01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:37.480]   And I think you're probably right, this was just convenient.
[01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:39.720]   But why be so vindictive?
[01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:41.640]   Do you think that Twitpick didn't like Twitter?
[01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:45.760]   There's like one last chance to kick 'em before they die or what?
[01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:48.160]   - I wonder if Twitter wants to just keep more
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:51.200]   of the property that shared on Twitter as Twitter-owned.
[01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:52.040]   - Of course they do.
[01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:54.640]   They've killed all the third parties and yeah.
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:57.320]   - Yeah, I mean, that's clearly the main message here.
[01:06:57.320 --> 01:07:00.040]   The other thing that comes to mind for me is,
[01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:01.640]   how is Twitter making its money?
[01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:05.640]   Is Twitter really valued appropriately as a company?
[01:07:05.640 --> 01:07:08.000]   Lots of people like to speculate on that.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.120]   And it's worth speculating on.
[01:07:10.120 --> 01:07:12.240]   I mean, anybody I know who lives in San Francisco
[01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:14.040]   has just been driven out of the city
[01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:16.680]   because of the costs largely brought about
[01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:19.840]   by Twitter's headquarters being in the-
[01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:24.400]   - Really, you don't blame Google and Apple, you blame Twitter.
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:26.040]   - Well, Twitter is right downtown.
[01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:26.880]   - Yeah.
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:28.160]   - Google and Apple are not.
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:31.120]   And people say like they built this giant campus,
[01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:34.040]   everybody came down, and that whole area was gentrifying
[01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:37.160]   anyway, and the prices were going up for apartments and rent.
[01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:39.760]   But I kind of wonder, you know, like,
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:42.280]   have we seen enough from Twitter to really know
[01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:44.680]   what their value is and what they own
[01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:46.040]   and what they're doing to make money?
[01:07:46.040 --> 01:07:48.880]   It still feels pretty nebulous to me.
[01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:53.920]   - You know, I saw recently an article that in fact,
[01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:56.200]   it isn't that expensive to live in New York.
[01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:57.440]   People always think, oh, that must be
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:07:59.280]   the most expensive city.
[01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:00.120]   It's not.
[01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:01.960]   What?
[01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:06.960]   - Well, it's expensive, but it's not as bad as San Francisco.
[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:10.240]   - It's still the hand in the mirror behind that.
[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:12.680]   - That's why I live in Petaluma, baby.
[01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:14.040]   - Shut up here.
[01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:18.640]   - I think it's easy to blame Twitter for the,
[01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:20.360]   but it's not really to the employee,
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:24.520]   what 3000 people, not all of them are in San Francisco.
[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:27.160]   So they can't single-handedly, you know,
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:32.160]   inflate the property values in San Francisco.
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:34.640]   - Oh, I don't think they can't think of that.
[01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:36.360]   - I think they're a factor.
[01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:37.560]   - No, they're not the factor.
[01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:40.720]   The factor is that there's a whole bunch of landlords
[01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:43.720]   who are putting their apartments on Airbnb,
[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:47.200]   which is what is inflating a lot of the real estate prices.
[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:50.960]   The people are renting more through Airbnb.
[01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:54.000]   And as a result of that, there is much fewer properties
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:54.840]   for sale.
[01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:58.400]   And there has also been very little real estate development.
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:08:59.880]   I think there is a lot of,
[01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:03.880]   it's not an easy and simple problem.
[01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:06.400]   It's a much more complex issue.
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:09.640]   And to say that Twitter is, you know,
[01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:12.840]   responsible for that, it's just kind of overreaching.
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:15.280]   I think, you know, Twitter as a company,
[01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:20.280]   you know, their valuation is actually much more reasonable
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:23.840]   than most people realize compared to,
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:26.240]   let's say something like, you know, Facebook,
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:30.000]   you know, Facebook's recent growth has come from
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.960]   all the mobile advertising or the mobile install,
[01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:37.480]   the app installs they've been selling to other applications,
[01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:39.200]   which is essentially, you know,
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:41.480]   all these VC-backed startups,
[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:44.040]   which are out there, pushing their apps.
[01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:46.320]   They're giving money to Facebook.
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:49.080]   I think if somebody needs to look into the revenues,
[01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:51.120]   you should look into the revenues of Facebook
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:53.480]   because they are, you know, they're not as great
[01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:54.800]   as they seem to be.
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:57.600]   You know, Twitter is doing what it's supposed to do
[01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:00.760]   as a company which doesn't know how to grow its user base,
[01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:02.600]   to make as much money as it can.
[01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:04.680]   They have struggled on one thing,
[01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:06.600]   which is to grow its user base,
[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:09.920]   to make it valuable to people who are like,
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:14.720]   were not hardcore, you know, internet nerds in many ways.
[01:10:14.720 --> 01:10:17.920]   I think average people find Facebook more interesting
[01:10:17.920 --> 01:10:22.640]   and, you know, Twitter is struggling to find those people
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:24.560]   and get them on their own platform.
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:27.680]   I think that is the real Twitter problem.
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:30.640]   - We did hear this week that Twitter was considering
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:34.080]   using some sort of edge ranking to change the feed.
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:36.640]   And boy, there's a petition and people are furious.
[01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:38.720]   As you know, the way Facebook's news feed works
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:40.400]   is very algorithmically controlled.
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:42.120]   We actually talked a lot about it
[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:43.280]   over the last couple of weeks.
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:46.760]   Robert Scoble even showed me how to make my Facebook feed better
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:49.560]   because you don't see everything your friends share on Facebook.
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:51.120]   You do currently on Twitter,
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:54.320]   your timeline of Twitter is composed entirely
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:56.800]   of everything tweeted by everybody you follow.
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:11:00.520]   But the story was, and I don't know if this has been confirmed
[01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:02.680]   by Twitter, that Twitter was looking at ways
[01:11:02.680 --> 01:11:04.880]   to change that, to make it more valuable
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:07.000]   by eliminating stupid tweets or something.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.880]   Have you, is that something Twitter said
[01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:11.400]   it's gonna do home or is that?
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:16.040]   - Well, they did indicate that they will be using more
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:20.880]   machine learning to, you know, to make adjustments
[01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:21.720]   to their feed.
[01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:24.880]   And I don't know how to what extent they're going to do that.
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:27.520]   I have no idea personally.
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:30.720]   I do think that we are all headed towards the future
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:34.040]   where, you know, you're gonna have the machines making
[01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:36.320]   a lot of decisions on our behalf.
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:39.920]   - I think Twitter is probably part of that bigger trend.
[01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:41.840]   I think Facebook is part of that bigger trend.
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:45.440]   I mean, why do we assume that things won't change
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:46.480]   at all these companies?
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:48.640]   I mean, they are essentially companies.
[01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:50.560]   And just because they were cute and cuddly
[01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:52.560]   in their early days doesn't mean.
[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:54.320]   - I want them to stay cute, cuddly.
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:57.800]   - Right, and it would be, it was fun to keep them cuddly
[01:11:57.800 --> 01:11:59.680]   home. - Why should Twitter not stay cute
[01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:01.840]   and cuddly? - Because I refuse to grow up.
[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:03.600]   That's my fault.
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:06.240]   This story actually came out of GigaOM.
[01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:11.240]   Twitter's CFO implied that a Facebook style,
[01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:12.720]   Matthew and England's writing,
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:15.160]   Facebook style filtered feed is coming,
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:17.900]   whether you like it or not.
[01:12:17.900 --> 01:12:22.680]   And of course, a lot of Twitter users don't like the idea.
[01:12:22.680 --> 01:12:25.160]   I mean, it feels like we should have a place
[01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:26.560]   for an unfiltered stream like Twitter.
[01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:29.660]   And if you like the filtered stream, go use Facebook.
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:34.080]   - I'm sorry, I stepped in your day.
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:35.280]   What were you saying?
[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:37.000]   - Oh, no, not one bit.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:39.760]   I think that it would be irresponsible if Facebook
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:42.720]   or if Twitter and every other company were not too,
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:43.640]   these are public companies.
[01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:45.960]   They have to explore things like this, right?
[01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:48.040]   Whether it's going to be implemented,
[01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:50.760]   how it would be implemented is just internet going,
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:51.960]   bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah,
[01:12:51.960 --> 01:12:55.220]   I mean, the rest is just time will tell.
[01:12:55.220 --> 01:12:59.320]   - A little bit of machine intelligence is important
[01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:02.520]   because look at just the sheer level of noise
[01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:04.000]   is so much right now.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.840]   I think it's like applying the Dolby system
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:08.440]   rather than anything else.
[01:13:08.440 --> 01:13:09.280]   - Right.
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:12.120]   - Sometimes people ask me about how I use Twitter,
[01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:15.400]   like parents or people who don't understand it.
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:19.000]   And I like to say, I kind of like roulette wheel it.
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.640]   It's all about what time of day I'm looking at my feed
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:26.040]   and how fast did I scroll my finger on my mobile device.
[01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:27.960]   Like, I really don't have,
[01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:30.200]   so it sounds good when I have my list
[01:13:30.200 --> 01:13:32.440]   that I follow and I'll look for specific things.
[01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:35.000]   But most of the time it really is like a roulette wheel.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:35.840]   And I like that.
[01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:36.680]   It's a surprise.
[01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:38.400]   It's like flipping through a magazine.
[01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:39.800]   So I have people that I follow.
[01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:41.880]   I follow a good number of people.
[01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:44.160]   It's a whole bunch of different interests.
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:46.960]   And I like that like randomness of it.
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:49.200]   In Facebook, I find completely boring.
[01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:52.280]   Like, I hope to never again write a story about Facebook
[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:56.360]   because it's just a place where people talk,
[01:13:56.360 --> 01:13:58.720]   where people share pictures of their grandkids
[01:13:58.720 --> 01:14:00.760]   and I'm completely bored by it.
[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:03.480]   And I have been, I felt bored with Facebook
[01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:05.000]   for like a year or two.
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.600]   And I don't know.
[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:08.680]   There comes a point where, you know,
[01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:11.520]   I understand that they are technology companies at heart
[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:13.080]   in one way or another.
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:16.000]   But I almost feel like we don't need to cover
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.800]   everything that's going on with Facebook.
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:20.520]   And we don't need to have articles talking about
[01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:22.640]   is Facebook a trend anymore?
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:23.640]   Is Facebook dying?
[01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:25.480]   Like, who cares?
[01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:28.480]   I think the next big trend, if it's not coming,
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:31.360]   it's already here, is exhaustion.
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:34.240]   I mean, I think that you can,
[01:14:34.240 --> 01:14:36.000]   the feed metaphor is fine.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.240]   It's established if it's not already over
[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:39.640]   and people are kind of, you know,
[01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:41.720]   Pinterest interest two years ago was,
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:43.680]   and their quick rise two years ago
[01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:46.560]   show that people are kind of into looking at things
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:47.520]   that look different.
[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:50.160]   But I think that if there is a big trend coming,
[01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:51.680]   it is just exhaustion.
[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:53.440]   There's too much noise in the system.
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:55.440]   They may be an opportunity for Twitter.
[01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:56.920]   They may be able to say, look,
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:58.600]   we'll capture your interest graph
[01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:02.080]   and not the graph of your social,
[01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:04.120]   you know, the all of the backdoor bragging
[01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:06.280]   that you have to do on Facebook.
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:09.440]   But I think that people are just exhausted of social media.
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:11.560]   And I think that there is just,
[01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:14.760]   I think like the next big app is no app, right?
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:16.160]   (laughing)
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:17.240]   I like it.
[01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:20.200]   - Wait, Dan, I wanna call Dan out on something for a second.
[01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:23.160]   So a couple of days ago, Dan posted on Google+
[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:25.400]   that he had given up Gmail
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:27.440]   and that he had put Facebook.
[01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:29.760]   And then today, Dan, it's so funny.
[01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:31.800]   I got a Facebook friend request from Facebook.
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:32.640]   - Dan.
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:35.520]   - Oh, well, the reason for that was I had a friend who,
[01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:38.640]   well, like, I mean, he posted a suicide note on Facebook.
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:40.000]   So I came back to Facebook.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.480]   I mean, there was a reason I came back.
[01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:42.480]   - Oh, that's terrible.
[01:15:42.480 --> 01:15:43.720]   - I mean, Leo, like you,
[01:15:43.720 --> 01:15:46.760]   I constantly want to kill my Facebook with Strangly,
[01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:49.520]   but I had a friend who I thought was strangling himself.
[01:15:49.520 --> 01:15:50.360]   So I came back.
[01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:51.200]   - Oh my God.
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:52.040]   - Is he okay?
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:54.440]   - He is okay, but that is one thing
[01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:56.080]   that I have found Facebook useful for.
[01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:58.040]   I think like you, Leo, and like a lot of people,
[01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:00.200]   I'm just exhausted with Facebook
[01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:01.800]   and that I don't want to brag.
[01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:04.080]   I don't, and I don't wanna see other people bragging.
[01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:06.240]   I just want to connect with people I love.
[01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:09.120]   But it is one of those things where my God,
[01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:10.760]   when I had a moment of terror,
[01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:12.640]   I sure as hell didn't go to Twitter.
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:14.000]   I mean, I went back to Facebook to a first guy.
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:14.840]   - Yeah, you're not gonna tweet him.
[01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:15.680]   - So, okay.
[01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:16.520]   - No, that's a great one.
[01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:17.360]   - No, no, of course.
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:18.280]   And in fact, I did go to Twitter
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:20.520]   and I found that he had longer go deleted as accounts.
[01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:22.400]   Why? Because he didn't feel like
[01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:24.400]   he was making a personal connection with people.
[01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:25.960]   And Facebook is where he did think
[01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:28.680]   he was making a personal connection with people.
[01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:30.880]   - Oh, and that's kind of why I don't like
[01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:32.560]   the algorithmic stuff on Facebook.
[01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:33.400]   - Yeah, right.
[01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:36.160]   - It gets in the way, I just wanna see my friend's stuff.
[01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:38.200]   And it just gets in the way of that.
[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:40.160]   - Sorry to be a dick about that.
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:41.160]   - There is a, sorry.
[01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:42.560]   - Oh no, I feel like I'm the star.
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:43.400]   - I'm the star.
[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:46.280]   - You guys kiss and make up, will ya?
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:47.120]   - Oh, you're okay.
[01:16:47.120 --> 01:16:47.960]   (laughing)
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:50.080]   - I'm just saying there was a reason for coming back.
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:52.000]   - Oh, I did leave Gmail though.
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:53.720]   I mean, I mapped 188,000.
[01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:55.240]   - Wait, wait, wait, wait, why leave Gmail?
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:56.200]   - I wanna hear about this.
[01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:57.560]   I wanna hear about this too.
[01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:02.000]   - Okay, so it's not explicitly anti-Google or anti-Facebook,
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:03.760]   but part of my thought process
[01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:06.080]   when I approach the social web and social apps
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:08.280]   is learning the mechanics of how these things work.
[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:10.240]   Just like a video game or any kind of game,
[01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:12.000]   you have to learn the fundamental principles
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:14.200]   of the things that make these things sticky.
[01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:17.560]   And part of me, I mean, we can look at
[01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:19.920]   Snowden's revelations last year and say,
[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:21.680]   all of the conversations that we've had
[01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:24.280]   in the last year and a half or so about privacy.
[01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:27.480]   I am somebody who loves PGP,
[01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:30.480]   and I do make sure that I take encryption seriously.
[01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:32.280]   But I also, when I approach the social web,
[01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:34.400]   I really wanna make sure that I'm not just,
[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:36.680]   that I'm dogfooding the advice I give to people
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:39.240]   and saying, look, let's look at the mechanics here
[01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:42.640]   that make a Gmail almost more sticky than Facebook.
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:44.520]   I mean, it's easier to leave Facebook
[01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:46.120]   than it is to leave Gmail.
[01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:48.440]   And so I just wanted to see if there is a,
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:49.880]   something that is robust.
[01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:51.280]   I always use Google Apps, right?
[01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:52.960]   I don't use peer Gmail.
[01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:54.440]   But I wanted to see if there is something,
[01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:57.880]   a product that is as robust in terms of my mail exchange,
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:00.120]   my mail servers, and that could handle,
[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:02.640]   I mean, I literally have 200,000 email in here.
[01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:07.120]   And I mean, I'm on every press release ever since.
[01:18:07.120 --> 01:18:08.520]   So I wanted to see if there's something
[01:18:08.520 --> 01:18:11.040]   that can handle the high volume of email that I get,
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:14.560]   but filter out the noise and let me see just the signal
[01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:18.440]   and could handle, you know, Google Apps is pretty robust.
[01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:20.680]   I wanted to see if there's something that can handle that.
[01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:23.560]   And I wanted to test my own stickiness to a Google product.
[01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:26.800]   I mean, it might be holding to this thing that is Google
[01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:28.720]   as much as I am to the thing that is Facebook.
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:32.720]   So it took a week, literally a week of IMAP ports,
[01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:34.800]   but I ported everything over to Fastmail
[01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:36.640]   and did the name server stuff there.
[01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:38.800]   And it seems to be holding up pretty well.
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:40.480]   - Actually, I've been using Fastmail for years.
[01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:42.920]   I just renewed my Fastmail account for five years.
[01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:44.840]   But I still use, you know, I use Gmail.
[01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:46.760]   The only reason is spam filtering.
[01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:48.760]   It's got the best spam filtering ever.
[01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:50.880]   So I just pumped my mail through Gmail.
[01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:52.440]   I don't actually use Gmail.
[01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:55.120]   I just, I borrow the spam filtering.
[01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:56.240]   I pump it through Gmail.
[01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:57.080]   - I see me, yeah.
[01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:58.880]   - And then I, yeah, it's great.
[01:18:58.880 --> 01:18:59.720]   - Right.
[01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:01.840]   - That's, to me, that's the only reason I use Gmail.
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:03.600]   - All right, so that was my little tech test
[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:04.440]   of the last week.
[01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:07.160]   Like, you know, can I leave the social services?
[01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:09.320]   And is there an app that is as robust as Gmail?
[01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:10.360]   - This is the new thing.
[01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:15.280]   I think, I think this is, you're gonna see a lot of this.
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:17.880]   People just throwing up their hands in the smay
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:18.720]   and saying, I'm off.
[01:19:18.720 --> 01:19:20.240]   I give up, I quit.
[01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:22.080]   - I think there is a more moderate way
[01:19:22.080 --> 01:19:23.200]   of doing these things.
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:26.200]   I have taken a more, you know,
[01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:28.280]   not as drastic an approaches that.
[01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:31.360]   But what I have done is I've removed both Twitter
[01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:35.440]   and Facebook from my iPhone and from my mobile devices.
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:36.520]   - That's what I did too.
[01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:41.520]   - And I use them twice or twice a day
[01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:44.600]   for Twitter and twice a day for Facebook
[01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:45.600]   on my desktop.
[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:46.880]   - That's a good idea.
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:49.680]   - So if I'm not at home and I'm moving about,
[01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:52.320]   I am not looking into the phone every five minutes
[01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:54.360]   to see what the hell is going on.
[01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:56.760]   We were sharing their cat videos or whatever.
[01:19:56.760 --> 01:19:59.560]   I mean, and the other thing which I did on my Facebook
[01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:03.360]   is I started unfriending people who kept putting up
[01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:06.560]   their cat pictures and their baby pictures.
[01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:08.560]   So like, I'm not interested.
[01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:11.400]   So that was a very drastic move in my part.
[01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:13.400]   But I just think those were the two
[01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:16.920]   and everything things which irritated me most about Facebook
[01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:21.920]   was cat pictures and pictures of their babies.
[01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:23.640]   It's like, okay.
[01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:25.000]   I mean, seriously.
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.720]   - We did a whole thing before Twitter last week
[01:20:27.720 --> 01:20:28.560]   with Robert Scobold.
[01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:30.360]   It's gonna be aired on September 29th,
[01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:32.120]   by the way people were wondering.
[01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:34.800]   It is a triangulation episode where he attempted to show me
[01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:37.800]   how to cultivate my Facebook feed to make it better.
[01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:39.440]   A lot of it was exactly that.
[01:20:39.440 --> 01:20:42.120]   Oh, I'm just getting rid of people
[01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:44.200]   that don't give you content you want.
[01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:46.560]   And it's gotten better, but it's still not anything.
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:47.400]   I want it.
[01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:49.400]   - Could you imagine if we did that in real life?
[01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:51.360]   If I was like, Leo, don't show me pictures
[01:20:51.360 --> 01:20:52.280]   of your kids anymore.
[01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:53.120]   I don't care.
[01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:54.120]   (laughs)
[01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:55.400]   Like, we, it's somebody like--
[01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:56.640]   - That's the beauty of Facebook.
[01:20:56.640 --> 01:20:58.760]   You can do it and then nobody knows.
[01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:01.840]   - Like our psychology and the way that we interact socially
[01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:04.560]   is so different online than this face to face.
[01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:07.480]   - I got a number of people who tried to refriend me after.
[01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:10.200]   I unfriended about 100 people.
[01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:13.680]   And quite a large number of them asked to be my friend again.
[01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:15.360]   And now I feel guilty.
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:17.760]   - But Jill, when you saw baby pictures,
[01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:20.080]   when you met people, you went to their house,
[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:23.240]   you're meeting them for coffee, it was in real life.
[01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:27.480]   So it was essentially one set of pictures, maybe a day.
[01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:29.040]   This is-- - Constant.
[01:21:29.040 --> 01:21:33.680]   - 500 pictures in a day is just a bit too much.
[01:21:33.680 --> 01:21:35.040]   I think-- - Yeah, but I mean,
[01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:37.760]   that's what you get if you meet somebody face to face now
[01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:39.040]   and they show you on their phone.
[01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:41.800]   You know, the pictures that their dog or their kids.
[01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:42.720]   - Or their friend, they're trying to do that.
[01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:44.560]   - And I don't unfriend these people.
[01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:47.000]   Like I don't use Facebook very often,
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.320]   but my sister and her kids, you know,
[01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:51.960]   like that's the main place where my sister posts photos
[01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:52.800]   of her kids.
[01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:54.800]   And I have to check in on that every now and again,
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:57.280]   because I'm a good aunt and that's what we do, right?
[01:21:57.280 --> 01:22:00.720]   So like, this is my selfless act of using these book
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:03.200]   as I go in and I check in on the baby pictures.
[01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:04.840]   - You're doing your duty.
[01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:06.560]   - No, I think that's more like--
[01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:08.400]   - I think it is socially responsible way
[01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:09.840]   to stay in touch with people, right?
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:10.840]   Like to show that I'm using--
[01:22:10.840 --> 01:22:12.800]   - To help clear their crops and farm fill
[01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:14.880]   and be fully engaged in them.
[01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:17.320]   Like I'm still using them, I'm still participating.
[01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:20.040]   It may be very lightweight, but I'm at least presenting
[01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:23.000]   that appearance that I'm there and I participate.
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.160]   - I think that's trying to be less, you know,
[01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:29.360]   prove to yourself and feel less guilty about everything.
[01:22:29.360 --> 01:22:30.360]   - You're a good person.
[01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:34.160]   - I think you all like to use Facebook for that reason.
[01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:36.320]   Oh, wow, birthday, happy birthday.
[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:38.240]   So, and so do we really mean it?
[01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:39.120]   Probably not.
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:40.960]   - Yeah, Facebook is social grease now.
[01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:43.080]   It's not real social engagement.
[01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:44.600]   It's getting, now I'm just gonna,
[01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:46.720]   let's just check to see.
[01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:49.000]   I did everything Scoble wanted me to do
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.400]   and I went through it and I really,
[01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:51.720]   let's see if I've really cleaned,
[01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:53.360]   there's a baby picture.
[01:22:53.360 --> 01:22:55.880]   Let's see if there's a baby picture.
[01:22:55.880 --> 01:23:00.480]   Oh, there's a Brussels going to New York.
[01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:03.560]   Here's an ad, here's a baseball picture.
[01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:05.920]   Yeah, no, it's no, it's still crap.
[01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:06.960]   It's still crap.
[01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:07.800]   And here's a baller.
[01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:09.360]   - Maybe you need better friends.
[01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:10.200]   (laughs)
[01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:11.320]   - That's what he said.
[01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:13.200]   He said you should get better friends.
[01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:15.640]   - Unfriend Scoble first.
[01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:17.760]   - Yeah, that's the first thing.
[01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:19.720]   Yeah, see, he said, follow more.
[01:23:19.720 --> 01:23:22.440]   You want to, yeah, follow me more.
[01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:25.960]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:27.160]   We'll come back, we'll wrap things up.
[01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:28.000]   We've got a great panel.
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:29.600]   It's nice to have Dan Patterson here.
[01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:31.640]   What is your affiliation these do?
[01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:32.760]   What are you up to, Dan?
[01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:38.760]   - I just did some writing for The Washington Post
[01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:39.760]   and the summer.
[01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:43.520]   I did a long-form study on the trafficking of guns
[01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:45.760]   on the so-called Iron Pipeline
[01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:48.160]   and the data behind gun trafficking here in New York City.
[01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:49.600]   - Now you were talking about that last time you were on,
[01:23:49.600 --> 01:23:51.720]   has that, if you published that, is that been published now?
[01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:55.280]   - Yeah, yeah, you can find that at contently.org.
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:56.480]   So I'm just a writer.
[01:23:56.480 --> 01:23:57.600]   I mean, that's the right.
[01:23:57.600 --> 01:23:59.120]   - I'm just a writer, he says.
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:23:59.960]   Just a writer.
[01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:02.240]   - That's all, maybe a reporter, maybe.
[01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:03.800]   - Angels of death.
[01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:05.000]   So who does, what is this?
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:05.920]   This is a nice, this is interesting.
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:07.720]   It's like contently.org.
[01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:09.160]   What is this?
[01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:10.600]   - Well, you must know contently.
[01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:12.200]   Do you guys use them?
[01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:14.240]   - No, we don't, unfortunately.
[01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:17.440]   But I do know them and it's pretty awesome.
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:20.160]   - Yeah, I mean, contently makes a number of products,
[01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:24.480]   but this one, contently.org is specifically
[01:24:24.480 --> 01:24:28.920]   intent to fund long-form journalism.
[01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:30.640]   So this was a two-month report.
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:33.760]   I know Jill's working on a long thing right now too, right?
[01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:35.120]   - Are you, Jill?
[01:24:35.120 --> 01:24:35.960]   What are you working on?
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:36.960]   - Yeah, I'm working on something.
[01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:39.400]   Well, PCMag is still my bread and butter,
[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:41.000]   and I'm working on something right now
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:43.240]   for "Pre-Lance for Prevention" magazine
[01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:45.800]   about the future of health and technology.
[01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:46.880]   So that's been really interesting,
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:49.560]   because I'm digging into it from a different side
[01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:51.720]   and interviewing a lot of doctors
[01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:54.080]   and people in the healthcare industry
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:55.520]   and trying to see, you know,
[01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:58.360]   what do we see happening in this first generation
[01:24:58.360 --> 01:24:59.760]   of fitness and health trackers?
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:03.480]   But where is that gonna lead in 10, 15, 20 years?
[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:04.680]   - Transhumanism.
[01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:07.160]   - Yeah, we're no longer going to be in our bodies.
[01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:10.240]   We will be in space in the galaxy.
[01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:15.080]   Is, actually, one of our viewers just sent me an FDA document
[01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:17.840]   about the rules for health trackers,
[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:19.440]   and those have been changed a little bit,
[01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:22.640]   probably to accommodate this new wave of health trackers.
[01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:23.440]   Is that right?
[01:25:23.440 --> 01:25:26.540]   - From what I understand, there's a very clear line
[01:25:26.540 --> 01:25:29.000]   about something being FDA-approved
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.880]   and something that does not need to be FDA-approved,
[01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:34.240]   and that doesn't make a diagnosis.
[01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:36.760]   So if it makes a diagnosis, you have to have FDA approval
[01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:39.280]   and you have to have some kind of,
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:41.320]   usually some kind of oversight with your doctor.
[01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:43.640]   So you can't just use these devices on your own,
[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:45.880]   generally, when they are FDA-approved.
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:48.000]   If something is not making a diagnosis,
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:49.680]   then it doesn't have to be.
[01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:52.440]   One of the blurriest lines is with sleep trackers.
[01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:53.840]   Well, I shouldn't say it's a blurry line,
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:55.520]   because the people who make the devices
[01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:58.400]   know exactly where the line is and they never cross it.
[01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:01.440]   But something as common as sleep apnea
[01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:02.760]   is considered a disease.
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:04.400]   So if you have a sleep tracker,
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:07.080]   you cannot, with it, diagnose someone
[01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:08.440]   as having sleep apnea.
[01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:12.080]   You have to say, here's the data that you've collected,
[01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:15.440]   you should look at it, decide for yourself what it means.
[01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:19.440]   So that's the very fine line that fitness trackers
[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:21.240]   try not to cross, because if they do,
[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:24.240]   they have to go through this long approval process.
[01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:26.960]   One of the most interesting products I've been following
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:31.760]   that is pending FDA approval is called Scan-a-Do Scout.
[01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:35.480]   So this has been in the news for the last year and a half or so.
[01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:37.320]   People like to call it the try quarter.
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:38.760]   So if you're a Star Trek fan.
[01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:40.520]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:42.400]   It's a handheld device.
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:44.400]   I have actually tried it on myself.
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:47.520]   So it's a little disc and it has--
[01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:49.200]   it takes a number of your vital signs.
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:53.760]   So your heart rate, your EKG reading, temperature,
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:55.800]   and a few other things.
[01:26:55.800 --> 01:26:57.400]   So you hold it up to your forehead,
[01:26:57.400 --> 01:27:00.040]   and while you're making that other connection with your finger,
[01:27:00.040 --> 01:27:03.040]   it's completing that circuit to take the EKG.
[01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:05.560]   And the idea is it's giving you an overall picture
[01:27:05.560 --> 01:27:08.520]   of your health, because it's taking so many different data
[01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:09.440]   streams.
[01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:12.160]   So one of the criticisms of modern day trackers
[01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:14.720]   is they usually have only one or two things
[01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:18.000]   that they monitor, whereas Scan-a-Do is collecting--
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:20.760]   I don't know, it's about five or six different data points.
[01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:22.640]   And the guy who made it is actually
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:24.280]   this really interesting inventor.
[01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:25.160]   He developed it.
[01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:27.440]   I believe-- if I remember correctly,
[01:27:27.440 --> 01:27:30.280]   he has a story about his son getting sick.
[01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:32.560]   And they go to the doctor, they go to the hospital,
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:35.040]   they're collecting all this information in the hospital.
[01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:37.480]   Nurses are coming in and taking his vital signs
[01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:38.360]   every so often.
[01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:39.960]   He's hooked up to machines.
[01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:43.120]   And this guy Walter de Brouwer is his name.
[01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:44.680]   Was just like, this is crazy.
[01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:46.240]   This is my kid.
[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:48.560]   I should be able to have this information.
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:50.680]   I should be able to see this data myself.
[01:27:50.680 --> 01:27:52.800]   We should own this stuff.
[01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:55.640]   So he's a really interesting guy, because he's a proponent
[01:27:55.640 --> 01:27:57.880]   that the FDA shouldn't be as strict
[01:27:57.880 --> 01:28:00.560]   and that we should be allowed to have more devices that
[01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:02.000]   collect information about ourselves.
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:03.760]   Because it's our body.
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:04.800]   It's our data.
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:07.040]   We should be allowed to have that.
[01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:10.720]   So that's one device I'm just like on the edge of my seat,
[01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:12.200]   waiting for this thing to be approved.
[01:28:12.200 --> 01:28:14.480]   But it could take years.
[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:16.920]   Well, so this document is kind of interesting.
[01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:20.920]   It is non-binding, but it says the intent of the FDA
[01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:25.000]   to no longer require pre-market notification requirements
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:28.440]   for some medical devices because they're well understood
[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:30.600]   and do not present risks.
[01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:33.680]   And if you look through the FDA database,
[01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:36.360]   current database of devices that have been submitted
[01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:41.840]   to approval for the FDA, Apple has nothing in there.
[01:28:41.840 --> 01:28:43.840]   Remember, Apple did meet with the FDA.
[01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:45.240]   And I imagine that part of the meeting
[01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:48.560]   was to say, well, how much do we have to get approval for?
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:50.640]   And it feels like the FDA has decided
[01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:53.760]   that at least when it comes to these Apple devices,
[01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:56.120]   either it's going to be third parties applying for approval
[01:28:56.120 --> 01:29:00.560]   or Apple may not even need to apply for approval.
[01:29:00.560 --> 01:29:03.680]   Apple is really good about working with its developers.
[01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:06.360]   So I think I wonder if part of this
[01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:10.120]   was to say what we're going to do is provide a platform.
[01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:13.120]   Everybody else is going to handle the devices.
[01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:15.440]   Some of them are even going to handle different software
[01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:15.960]   and apps.
[01:29:15.960 --> 01:29:19.400]   We're just going to be the platform where everything comes in.
[01:29:19.400 --> 01:29:22.320]   I wonder if that was the direction of the conversation.
[01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:24.320]   But it's Apple.
[01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:25.760]   They have meetings with everybody.
[01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:26.760]   And they have clout.
[01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:28.600]   And nobody says no to a meeting with Apple,
[01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:31.280]   as we've already established on this show.
[01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:34.040]   Oh, Malek is also here from gigaohm.com back
[01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:36.040]   from his World Travelers.
[01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:37.440]   What are you excited about?
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:38.960]   One of the things everybody should read,
[01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:43.080]   oh, every week posts on the weekend, his weekend reads,
[01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:45.560]   which is a great source for just interesting,
[01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:47.400]   provocative stuff.
[01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:49.120]   And you still do in that, of course.
[01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:50.960]   I took the summer off.
[01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:52.600]   Are you going to come back and do it?
[01:29:52.600 --> 01:29:53.080]   Yeah.
[01:29:53.080 --> 01:29:53.600]   Good.
[01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:55.120]   Starting next week.
[01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:55.520]   Good.
[01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:57.160]   Yeah, because that I loved.
[01:29:57.160 --> 01:29:58.600]   I really loved that.
[01:29:58.600 --> 01:29:59.840]   And what else are you up to?
[01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:01.680]   Anything else you'd like to mention?
[01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:06.160]   No, just doing my thing, traveling, meeting
[01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:07.680]   interesting people always.
[01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:11.520]   And I will let you know how I feel about the Apple event
[01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:12.840]   on Tuesday.
[01:30:12.840 --> 01:30:13.760]   We're going to grab you.
[01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:15.160]   We're going to have a camera crew down there.
[01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:16.760]   And if we can find you, I'd love to grab you
[01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:18.920]   and get your opinion afterwards.
[01:30:18.920 --> 01:30:19.760]   I'll be there.
[01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:20.280]   Good.
[01:30:20.280 --> 01:30:21.280]   Better jacket.
[01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:22.680]   You'll be on your show.
[01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:23.840]   Yeah, you'll be all dressed up.
[01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:25.960]   It'll be great.
[01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:28.360]   Our show today, we're going to have a few final words in a second.
[01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:31.360]   I've showed today brought to you by our good friends at stamps.com.
[01:30:31.360 --> 01:30:33.120]   Anybody who does a lot of mailing,
[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:34.640]   ought to know about stamps.com.
[01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:35.480]   It happens to me.
[01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:36.560]   It just happened again the other day.
[01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:41.080]   People send me stuff for review to look at postage due.
[01:30:41.080 --> 01:30:45.040]   And I was like, you're expected to pay $1.49 to me,
[01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:48.480]   the post office says, if you want to see what's in this package.
[01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:49.280]   That's crazy.
[01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:51.920]   That's not a good way to introduce yourself to somebody.
[01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:55.800]   If you send stuff out via mail and you're not using stamps.com,
[01:30:55.800 --> 01:30:57.720]   you're not looking as professional as you could.
[01:30:57.720 --> 01:31:01.520]   Stamps.com, first of all, eliminates the trip to the post office.
[01:31:01.520 --> 01:31:04.040]   It lets you print your own postage.
[01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:05.560]   With your computer, your printer,
[01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:08.640]   you know, just postage meter, a special link, or anything.
[01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:12.760]   They have a great USB scale that would eliminate the postage due problem
[01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:15.880]   because it automatically prints exactly the right amount of postage.
[01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:18.280]   So you put neither too little nor.
[01:31:18.280 --> 01:31:20.720]   I think a lot of people do this too much.
[01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:23.840]   Before I got stamps.com, I was always putting a couple extra stamps on there,
[01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:26.000]   just in case.
[01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:26.880]   That's a waste of money.
[01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:31.280]   Stamps.com also looks more pro because it can go right on your envelope.
[01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:34.320]   You print right to the envelope with your company's logo,
[01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:38.840]   the postage, of course, the recipient's address and your address, all pre-filled.
[01:31:38.840 --> 01:31:43.120]   It will read the information from eBay, Amazon, Etsy.
[01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:46.080]   So you don't have to enter anything in all of the sites.
[01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:50.200]   It will automatically fill out customs forms if you're mailing internationally.
[01:31:50.200 --> 01:31:54.680]   And you get discounts, you can't get at the post office at Stamps.com.
[01:31:54.680 --> 01:31:57.520]   A priority mail, an insurance.
[01:31:57.520 --> 01:31:58.640]   It's all automatic.
[01:31:58.640 --> 01:31:59.720]   It's all simple to use.
[01:31:59.720 --> 01:32:03.880]   And we have got a really good trial offer for you.
[01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:08.280]   If you visit Stamps.com, click the microphone in the upper right hand corner
[01:32:08.280 --> 01:32:12.400]   and use our offer code TWIT, T-W-I-T
[01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:15.680]   for an offer, I don't think they even offer this on the front page anymore.
[01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:16.720]   This is a great deal.
[01:32:16.720 --> 01:32:18.920]   $55 in free postage.
[01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:21.040]   You get a free digital scale.
[01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:22.720]   You get a $5 supply kit.
[01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:26.160]   And of course, if we trial of Stamps.com.
[01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:28.440]   Stamps.com, give it a try today.
[01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:32.600]   Absolutely the best way to start sending your letters and packages.
[01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:41.000]   Over 2 billion letters and packages were sent this year via Stamps.2 billion via Stamps.com.
[01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:44.560]   There's-- Apple is going to livestream the event, by the way.
[01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:49.440]   And if you go to apple.com/live, you get the countdown clock.
[01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:52.000]   They're really treating this like a big deal.
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:54.920]   So I'm glad they're streaming it.
[01:32:54.920 --> 01:32:58.640]   A little word, you have to use an Apple device to watch it.
[01:32:58.640 --> 01:33:02.280]   You cannot stream it on a Windows PC.
[01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:03.640]   Oh, don't you love Apple.
[01:33:03.640 --> 01:33:09.280]   Live streaming video requires Safari on OS 10 or an Apple TV.
[01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:14.240]   I presume you could do it on an iPad as well.
[01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:17.800]   So can we find a chat at Apple TV so we can watch?
[01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:19.160]   You don't have an Apple?
[01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:20.760]   I think we already have one.
[01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:22.520]   Safari for Windows, right?
[01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:24.120]   What are you using?
[01:33:24.120 --> 01:33:26.200]   No, for what?
[01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:26.960]   The desktop.
[01:33:26.960 --> 01:33:28.360]   For life?
[01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:28.840]   The desktop?
[01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:29.800]   I'm using a Mac.
[01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:31.240]   I could just stream it from here.
[01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:31.600]   Yeah.
[01:33:31.600 --> 01:33:35.120]   I tried to hide the label, but it's all credit now.
[01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:37.920]   So I need to get a Snow White sticker or something.
[01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:42.000]   You need your own screen with your own logo on it.
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:42.720]   You can get it.
[01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:44.400]   We actually did the researchers, companies
[01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:48.800]   that will mill new aluminum backs with the Twit logo on it.
[01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:50.080]   But it's like $500.
[01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:50.840]   I should do it.
[01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:51.800]   Dude, don't be cheap.
[01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:52.320]   I'm cheap.
[01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:53.560]   I'm not.
[01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:54.120]   I know.
[01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:55.520]   Should we do a Kickstarter for you?
[01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:56.920]   Yeah, that's a good idea.
[01:33:56.920 --> 01:33:57.440]   Yeah.
[01:33:57.440 --> 01:33:58.000]   Yeah.
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:01.560]   Hey, help Leo have a special laptop lid.
[01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:04.280]   It's about all you get from Kickstarter anyway.
[01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:06.560]   Anything I missed, Microsoft is going
[01:34:06.560 --> 01:34:11.880]   to appeal the court order says, we're not going to give handover Irish email stored
[01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:13.080]   on Irish servers.
[01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:15.600]   That's a good thing, but they'll lose in the end, I imagine.
[01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:16.800]   And then they'll hand them over.
[01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:19.400]   So big deal, right?
[01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:20.160]   Here's a story.
[01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:27.320]   New Zealand internet users were so keen to see naked celebrity pictures.
[01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:30.760]   They actually crashed the entire nation's internet.
[01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:37.440]   Telecommunications giant spark.
[01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:41.720]   It took them till Sunday to repair what it called what it termed a dynamic cyber
[01:34:41.720 --> 01:34:48.760]   attack, overloading its system because everybody was trying to get pictures at the same time.
[01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:51.000]   So just, you know, spread it out.
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:52.320]   Your neighbors get it, then you get them.
[01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:53.040]   OK, don't do it.
[01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:56.080]   Don't try to do it all at once.
[01:34:56.080 --> 01:34:58.120]   I think we've seen the week of IFA.
[01:34:58.120 --> 01:34:59.000]   We've seen everything.
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:00.760]   It's time to wait and see what Apple says.
[01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:03.640]   We will do that coverage live starting at 10 AM Pacific.
[01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:05.240]   That's 1 PM Eastern time.
[01:35:05.240 --> 01:35:08.560]   1700 UTC Tuesday, September 9.
[01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:13.120]   Join me, Mike Elgin, Sarah Lane and Alex Lindsay as we cover the live event.
[01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:15.720]   And then immediately after a special Mac break weekly,
[01:35:15.720 --> 01:35:19.880]   I just, Dean, will join us Andy and Iko, Renee Richie, live from Cupertino.
[01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:22.480]   Maybe O'Malley, if we can grab him.
[01:35:22.480 --> 01:35:23.520]   And who knows?
[01:35:23.520 --> 01:35:27.080]   I don't know who else will be there, but we'll get as many people as we can to give you
[01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:30.440]   their impression of whatever Apple announces and whether it is a world
[01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:35.080]   changer or just another ho-hum list of products.
[01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:36.400]   Thank you, Dan Patterson, for being here.
[01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:37.640]   We appreciate it.
[01:35:37.640 --> 01:35:38.120]   Thank you.
[01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:39.920]   Great to see you again.
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:40.480]   You too.
[01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:42.760]   Oh, Malek, you're the best.
[01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:48.040]   He wants to call me the Yoda of technology reporting, but in fact, you are the Yoda.
[01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:48.960]   You are the man.
[01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:50.240]   Yeah.
[01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:51.520]   It's always good to see you.
[01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:53.280]   Keep your home.com.
[01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:57.600]   And of course, thank you so much, Jill Duffy, for being here in your--
[01:35:57.600 --> 01:35:58.160]   My pleasure.
[01:35:58.160 --> 01:36:00.880]   Very attractive jumpsuit.
[01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:01.520]   Nice to have you.
[01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:03.600]   Does it have any health--
[01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:06.680]   Serts, things in there at all?
[01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:08.840]   No, no, not this one.
[01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:12.440]   I like to say this is my three's company outfit.
[01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:15.040]   It's a little blast back there.
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:16.480]   Come on, knock on our door.
[01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:18.080]   If you missed-- thank you guys for being here.
[01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:18.640]   We appreciate it.
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:22.400]   If you missed anything this week on Twitch, you actually-- we had a very fun week.
[01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:27.800]   And of all the Twitch promos we've done, I think this reflects very accurately
[01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:30.520]   what it was like this week on Twitch Watch.
[01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:32.400]   Last time on Twitch.
[01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:36.480]   If you bring a laptop just a little tip, you could turn it around and FaceTime.
[01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:38.360]   Apple invitations have gone out.
[01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:39.040]   Did you get one?
[01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:39.960]   It did.
[01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:40.880]   Shut up.
[01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:41.960]   You're all going.
[01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:43.480]   You think you just fell off the list?
[01:36:43.480 --> 01:36:44.840]   They used to love me.
[01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:47.240]   They don't even know I exist.
[01:36:47.240 --> 01:36:48.440]   Twitter Live Special.
[01:36:48.440 --> 01:36:51.560]   Scare-as-bring the freedom of a small fine tier race.
[01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:55.120]   For any software update, you have to reconnect to a galaxy promise.
[01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:56.560]   Freedom.
[01:36:56.560 --> 01:36:58.920]   Apparently a new definition of freedom.
[01:36:58.920 --> 01:36:59.920]   Tech news today.
[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:02.640]   Well, Christina Warren, you wrote a really interesting piece called,
[01:37:02.640 --> 01:37:06.320]   "How I Hacked My Own iCloud Account for Just $200."
[01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:11.360]   Even with two factor authentication on, I was able to download my iCloud backups
[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:12.160]   from the cloud account.
[01:37:12.160 --> 01:37:14.560]   Any sort of prompt, any sort of notification.
[01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:15.520]   The Social Hour.
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:16.120]   PewDiePie.
[01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:19.240]   Very popular YouTube celebrity turned up comments.
[01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:21.560]   YouTube comments are such a cesspool.
[01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:22.640]   This week in Google.
[01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:25.280]   I think the world needs a verified social network.
[01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:26.440]   Jeff, what do you think?
[01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:28.800]   I already registered a verified dot zone.
[01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:31.720]   I know a lot of a-holes by me.
[01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:32.560]   Twitter.
[01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:35.560]   Technology isn't always pretty, but we are.
[01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:37.080]   It's so pretty.
[01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:38.560]   Oh, man.
[01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:39.600]   We're so gross.
[01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:43.280]   Oh, that's-- that's-- I can't unsee that.
[01:37:43.280 --> 01:37:46.200]   We got a big week ahead, and I think Mike Elgin, our news director,
[01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:47.400]   has it all lined up.
[01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:48.600]   Mike, what's coming up?
[01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:50.000]   Coming up this week, the big event
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.680]   is Apple's announcement at the Flint Center in Cupertino,
[01:37:52.680 --> 01:37:55.160]   the company's expected to unveil a couple of new iPhones
[01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:56.400]   and a smartwatch.
[01:37:56.400 --> 01:37:59.520]   Our live coverage will happen right here at live.twit.tv,
[01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:03.200]   starting at 9.30 AM Pacific, 12.30 PM Eastern.
[01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:06.160]   TNT will take place at 9 AM Pacific on that day
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:08.840]   with our Apple coverage immediately following.
[01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:12.760]   Also, Reddit, 4-square, Etsy, Kickstarter, Mozilla, Vimeo,
[01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:15.760]   and other sites are planning a net neutrality day of action
[01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:17.600]   on Wednesday, September 10.
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:19.640]   They'll showcase net neutrality issues on their sites
[01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:22.720]   and invite visitors of post comments on the FCC, Congress,
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:25.720]   and White House websites in support of strong net neutrality.
[01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:27.520]   The protest is scheduled for just a few days
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:30.360]   before the end of the FCC's public comments period
[01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:31.840]   on Monday, the 15th.
[01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:32.560]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:34.520]   Thank you, Mike Elgin, news director TNT Monday
[01:38:34.520 --> 01:38:37.160]   through Friday, normally 10 AM Pacific.
[01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:40.320]   1700 UTC will be-- you'll be doing a little bit early
[01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:42.360]   on Tuesday to make room for the Apple event.
[01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:44.240]   Thank you, Dan Patterson, oh, Malick.
[01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:45.120]   Thank you, Jill Defe.
[01:38:45.120 --> 01:38:46.400]   Thank you all for joining us.
[01:38:46.400 --> 01:38:47.160]   We'll see you next time.
[01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:47.960]   Another twist--
[01:38:47.960 --> 01:38:48.520]   It's amazing.
[01:38:48.520 --> 01:38:49.520]   --again.
[01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:52.240]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:53.240]   Do the twist.
[01:38:53.240 --> 01:38:54.240]   All right.
[01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:56.240]   Do the twist, baby.
[01:38:56.240 --> 01:38:57.240]   Do the twist.
[01:38:57.240 --> 01:38:58.240]   All right.
[01:38:58.240 --> 01:39:00.240]   Do the twist, baby.
