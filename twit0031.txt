[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800]   This is Twit, this week in Tech, episode 31 for November 20th, 2005.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   And we're back to Skype.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   It's kind of a stripped down basic, you know, twit unplugged today.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   John C. Devorak is on Skype from his Fortress of Solitude.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   And Steve Gibson is also joining us from his Fortress of Solitude.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   We're all kind of by ourselves. It's pathetic. Patrick's down.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Maybe somebody else will show up.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   Yeah, I'll keep an eye on the Skype and maybe somebody will come in.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   Patrick is down in Baja Racing, I believe.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   The Fortress of Solitude is the only way to get any work done.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   That's why you guys all...
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Yeah, we're all in our offices by ourselves.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   I think there's some festival in Tennessee going on right now, like the Create 2.4.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Tennessee festival?
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Who had some sort of a blogging thing?
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   It's like multimedia creating kind of thing. I don't know.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   I know Dave is there.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Sounds thrilling.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   You should have seen the pod fest last weekend, John.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   It was something.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Is it that one Leo went to? He was telling me about it.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Yeah, I was there too.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   And it was really reminiscent of that the first couple years of Condex.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Remember those very little Condex shows in Vegas when it was sort of like,
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   "Okay, what the hell is this going to be?"
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Felt to me like the West Coast Computer Fair.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   How many people were there?
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   2000.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Oh, it was a little smaller than both those items.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   And I don't know how many exhibitors.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   And this is kind of interesting. 33 countries, 42 states.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   So it was, I think podcasting in some ways is a more international phenomenon.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   What kind of exhibitors were there?
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   There were a number of hardware exhibitors showing stuff for podcasters.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   You know, like tell us the folks who make the Zephyr, which I use for doing the radio show,
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   was there.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Microphone manufacturers, there were a number of software companies offering software solutions.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   And then there were some, you know, the nicest booth belonged to the eyeloung.com team.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   That's the old iPod lounge website.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   That's an iPad website.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   They had a beautiful, god, they have a gorgeous Condex style booth.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   I think that overall the feeling was that it was a show from people who were like saying,
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   "Okay, here's how we're going to enable people to do podcasts."
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Yeah, there was a lot of that.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   And then people advertising agencies, you know, companies that were hoping to kind of make money on the podcast,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   like PodTrack, which I think is the front runner at this point.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Where was this event?
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   The Ontario, California Expo, you know, Conference Center, like right next to the Ontario airport.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   They went big time.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Oh, man.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   It must have been cheap.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   The thing about Ontario is an interesting city because it's in the inland empire, you know, it's inland.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   And I think it's really like a big truck terminus.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   It's like we're all of LA's stuff goes or something.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Well, whenever I do any UPS package tracking, if it gets to Ontario, I know it's, you know, at least in the same state as I am.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   So the UPS has a big terminal there?
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Yeah, huge terminus there.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   That's what it looks like.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   It looks, I mean, as you fly in, it's kind of strange because you just see giant warehouse after warehouse at warehouse.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   And there's all these trucks lined up like puppies at the nipple, you know, I mean, there's a hallway around it.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   Well, so let's get to the news this week.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Yes, lots of good tech news.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   And one thing that we have, we've missed you, John, because you've been gone a few weeks,
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   and we haven't had a chance to talk to you about the Sony fiasco.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   What's your take on the Sony BMG rootkit?
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Actually, I wrote a column about it. It reminds me of the old in living color with the guy.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   He says, "I wrote a song about it."
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   I remember that.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   So I wrote a column about it in market watch.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   And I kind of thought that, I mean, it is a total fiasco.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   And it may actually put Sony in some sort of legal difficulties because there's, you know, some, apparently some laws about this sort of thing, essentially, you know,
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   installing malware without the permission of the user.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Good.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Good. I hope there's actual liability here.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   If somebody, if you go to that column just for people out there on marketwatch.com, there's a link in there to probably, I think, the definitive article ever written on this thing.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   I mean, some guy who would actually, you know, has broken this thing down to, like, you know, the, to the bit level.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   And then there's a follow-up of about...
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   It must be.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Mark Rousinovich's a column from Sisson Journal's.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   I don't, to be honest about it, I can't remember.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   But whatever the case is, it's the comments that are interesting because that's where people keep citing case law about how, you know, this could be a serious problem for Sony that they even did this.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   And one person pointed out the most interesting fact, which is that they had at this company, which is the internet for whatever that...
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Right.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   First for internet.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   First for internet.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Apparently some of the guys that work there are ex-Soney people.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   And so there may be some nepotism here.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Oh.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Well, of course, you know, the persistent rumors that they borrowed code from lame and from another...
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   What was the other one?
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   There were some lame copyright strings found in the binaries that are being installed, which is a breach of the GPL.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Bruce Schneier had a very... I think his blog column was very interesting.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   And he made a very interesting point.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   You know, he rehashed the whole thing.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   But then he said, "But when here's the story, are the security companies giving Sony a free pass?
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   Why weren't they on this story sooner?
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Why did it take them so long to make removers?
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Why did they respond faster?"
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   And he said, "Well, I think they're going to be a great guy.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   I think they're going to be a great guy.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   I think they're going to be a great guy.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   I think they're going to be a great guy.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   I think they're going to be a great guy.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   I think they're going to be a great guy.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   I think they're going to be a great guy.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   I think they're going to be a great guy.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   I think they're going to be a great guy.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   I think they're going to be a great guy.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   I think they're going to be a great guy.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   I think they're going to be a great guy.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   The antivirus company that also makes anti-spyware.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   There was a discussion about the problem right now.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Besides the fact that there's 200 variations a day on spyware, they essentially have to set up...
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   They're using this heuristic stuff now to try to out guess when something weird starts happening to the computer.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   To look at behavior instead of...
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   It looks at behavior but then what it does?
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   Right.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   The signature thing isn't working anymore.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   What it does is it looks at behavior, then it's sent...
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   I think all the virus companies are starting to do this.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   In the Panda case, they send a memo to the home quarters.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   First they ask if you want to send it.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Then they send a bunch of information from your machine to see what the heck's going on.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Then it's after the fact that they developed a cure for it.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   You know, you just... the stuff could be installed in on that recognized for, like you said, a year.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   I don't think it was anybody turning a blind eye.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   I think they were just... didn't know.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Well, there's also the bigger issue that they may have been reluctant because it's illegal to remove this root kit.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   You're violating the DMCA by reverse engineering copy protection.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Now, I don't think anybody's going to go to court to pursue it.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Yeah, I don't think that's their concern.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   I don't think anyone's sitting around saying, "Oh God, what we do now?"
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Well, why does it take semantic a week to come out with a patch or at least an alert?
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   Why would they wait so long?
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Don't you think that this happens all the time where it certainly happens with keystroke loggers?
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   If a keystroke logger is from a big company, they ignore it.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   If it's from a hacker, they find it.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   What's the difference?
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   You know, if it's who...
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   I have to start asking them if you insist on this line of questioning, you know?
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   I'll have to like... I have to look into it.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   Well, I'm curious.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   It certainly is.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Bruce Schnire.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   I think Bruce is pretty credible for Percy.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.500]   It's certainly not unreasonable to suggest that maybe the fact that it came from Sony would
[00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.000]   have given them some pause.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Sure.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.040]   And yet, well, maybe it won't anymore because now we know that even Sony can do something
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.000]   absolutely horrendous.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.840]   And I mean, you know, there's going to be half a million machines that will always be vulnerable
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.000]   to this attack now.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   By the way, I do have a link on my blog and I think it's fairly current.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.800]   Maybe a day or two ago, that links to the Sony site that lists all the CDs that have the
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:05.920]   rootkit software.
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.720]   And there's about 52 of them, I think.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:10.000]   They are finally recalling them, aren't they?
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   In fact, Steve ordered one.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.600]   Yeah, in fact, yeah, exactly.
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:21.000]   I purchased the number one CD on Amazon, which was this old Neil Diamond 12 favorite songs,
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   which I almost bought by the leg.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   But I was going to buy it on iTunes, which wouldn't have had the problem, I guess.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   Totally.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.240]   And a couple of days ago, I received email from Amazon following up telling me that this
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.520]   CD was defective.
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:41.440]   And if I wished to return it opened or not, they would gladly accept it back.
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.440]   It's defective.
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:43.440]   I love that.
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.440]   Defective.
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.440]   It is.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.440]   How do they know?
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.440]   Because it's got the rootkit on it.
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.440]   That's defective.
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:53.800]   So is Sony going to suffer a long-term black eye for this?
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:57.440]   You know, I wonder, because I think it's just the cognitive senti, you know, the people
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.560]   like ourselves that really get all worked up about this.
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:06.160]   But the larger audience, the people that buy these CDs that are not computers, I mean,
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:07.560]   maybe never put it in a computer.
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:10.400]   I mean, not everybody who buys a CD ever drops it in a machine.
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.040]   They tend to put it in their car, and that's the end of it.
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.480]   I think that's the majority of the users.
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:19.960]   And so I think it'll be a very small blip, to be honest, about it.
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.640]   I think they'll get a lot of ragging.
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:26.040]   I think people will give them crap every time they turn around, point the finger, and they'll
[00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.520]   be called pulling a Sony.
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:30.720]   But I don't think it's going to really hurt them that much.
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:31.720]   It's kind of sad.
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:36.960]   I mean, I think this is just one more brick in the wall for Sony.
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:42.880]   I mean, they've gone from being a premier consumer electronic company to kind of not
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:43.880]   any more the leader.
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:49.280]   I mean, the Samsung and LG have kind of taken over as technology leaders in the consumer
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.280]   electronic space.
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:59.960]   You know, the CEO that was really the top guy at Sony that I guess he passed away.
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.600]   Right now, the people managing that company seem to be kind of arrogant.
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:05.960]   They always have public relations problems.
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:10.160]   I've never known any public relations outside agencies that ever work for the company for
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.280]   more than like nine months or so.
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.280]   And then they get new ones.
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:16.640]   It's very difficult to get sample products from them because you can't find out who you
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.280]   can get them from.
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:20.040]   It's a very difficult company to work with.
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:23.480]   They're not very friendly.
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:28.440]   And their products are not necessarily competitive even though they do make a lot of great products.
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:32.840]   And I also think putting all their eggs in the Sony PlayStation basket may not be such
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:36.400]   a good idea in the long term because that company's always been very diversified with
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:43.640]   all kinds of professional TV gear to little walkmen, stool kinds of things in between.
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.480]   And they pretty much end the movie.
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.600]   They got a movie business too.
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:51.600]   And it seems to me that right now they're putting all their eggs in the PlayStation basket and
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.640]   banking on that thing.
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:58.080]   It's possible that this PlayStation 3 won't be the big winner that it needs to be.
[00:11:58.080 --> 00:11:59.600]   It's kind of funny though.
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:03.000]   You might have said after Marita died that maybe Sony over diversified.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.240]   I mean, that's when they went on this big acquisition campaign and turned into a movie
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.560]   company and a record company.
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.720]   Maybe that's when they lost their products.
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:14.200]   Well, actually, maybe that's I guess that's an interesting point because yeah, they maybe
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.840]   they went too far.
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:17.680]   I mean, they've always been diversified.
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:21.560]   But it seems to me that they're still putting most of their emphasis.
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:25.640]   If you read enough of the business trade journals about Sony, they're putting all their emphasis.
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:28.400]   They make most of their money off the PlayStation.
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:32.120]   And Microsoft is very aggressive with this Xbox 360.
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:33.800]   Well, that takes us to our next story.
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:34.800]   Xbox 360 goes--
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:35.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:36.800]   Microsoft wants to be in the market.
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:37.880]   It goes on sale on Tuesday.
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.720]   And already there are big shortages.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:44.880]   In fact, if you want to buy one, your best bet is probably to go on to eBay and pay twice
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:45.880]   the going rate.
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:48.480]   They're selling on eBay for $800 and $900 for this one.
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.480]   Yeah, and that's for the low-end ones.
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.600]   I actually have a PlayStation 360.
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.240]   And I have the loaded one.
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.920]   And you know, well, the thing is the games.
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:58.920]   We're had to wait for some games.
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.320]   There's some built-in games.
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:03.720]   I have played with this thing for some time now.
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:07.520]   And besides the one I have, I've played with the sample.
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.920]   They've had some dog and pony shows.
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:11.000]   I'm very impressed with it.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.720]   One of the most impressive things about it is the user interface is fairly astonishing
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.480]   for Microsoft.
[00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.120]   And my son was playing with it.
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:22.480]   I don't want to fix the Skype thing here.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.320]   He made the interesting comment.
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:28.560]   Why don't they have these guys do the user interface for Windows?
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:29.560]   Right.
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:32.320]   Maybe they should.
[00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.400]   You know, I wouldn't have argued with it.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.040]   It's a very interesting user interface.
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:38.680]   Well, how does it compare to the old Xbox user interface?
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:39.680]   It's just different.
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:42.440]   It uses a tab.
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:43.960]   It's just hard to explain.
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:44.960]   I mean, it's--
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:45.960]   You have to see it, I guess.
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:46.960]   It's good.
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.440]   It's a funny thing.
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:51.360]   I mean, it's kind of fun to play with it.
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:53.600]   It's just-- when you play with it, you'll see.
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.680]   But it's a very nice box.
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:56.680]   And it's sleek.
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:57.480]   It's a well-designed.
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:00.200]   They went through a lot of trouble to make it look Italian.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.720]   And you get to--
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.800]   Is it actually Italian or just looks Italian?
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:04.800]   It looks Italian.
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:05.800]   It's kind of the horse car.
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:07.880]   It's like a sports car, yeah.
[00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.120]   They got skins for it.
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:13.880]   And they have the hard disk that comes on and off the thing.
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:14.720]   So beautifully.
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.680]   It's very nicely engineered.
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.240]   And I can see a lot of third party people
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:21.480]   dropping big hard disks on this thing.
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:22.840]   The shortage, though, might hurt them.
[00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:24.880]   If they can't get enough, I'm talking--
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:26.640]   The shortage may be BS.
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:28.800]   You think that's to create demand?
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:29.440]   It could.
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.520]   I mean, that's what I would do.
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:35.120]   Retailers are getting a quarter of the allocation or less.
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.160]   Do we know that for a fact?
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.000]   Well, I've talked to a couple.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.360]   And a lot of stores are saying they're getting--
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.440]   the local Walmart got four.
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:44.320]   Well, that's good news.
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.160]   So you know there's going to be a battle.
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.520]   Now, of course, that does certainly help the buzz
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.720]   if you see people in line fighting to get one.
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:51.880]   It's really funny, too.
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:54.560]   When you think about this shortage this year versus
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.160]   what it'll be next year, next Christmas,
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.600]   there'll be huge pyramids of these things.
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:01.800]   You won't be able to not buy one when you go into a store.
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:05.360]   But this is a key opportunity because PlayStation 3 comes out
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:06.040]   in the spring.
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:10.560]   They've got six months to really make this thing ramp up.
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:12.280]   So you don't have any games for it?
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:14.120]   Well, there's a couple of games that come with it,
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:16.760]   including one of the new Tetris-like games
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.760]   that's designed by that Russian character who
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.240]   works for Microsoft.
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.000]   Pajitnov, does he work for them now?
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.840]   Yeah, he's been working for him for about eight years,
[00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.200]   I believe.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.560]   He was that tech TV came in one time when--
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:31.560]   Alexi Pajitnov.
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:32.360]   Yeah, Pajitnov.
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.360]   He designed Tetris and they gave him an XT for it,
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.680]   an AT, that's what he got, because this was still Soviet.
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:39.920]   But he was happy.
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.640]   Yeah, well, he's happy as a clam working in Microsoft.
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.120]   That's what I was saying now.
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.560]   Apparently, he gets to do all kinds of little projects.
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.040]   I want to see games.
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.480]   What are he's doing in the UI?
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:51.120]   You know, the Xbox UI kind of migrated
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.320]   into Windows Media Center.
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:55.480]   So it isn't unheard of that if they do have a good idea
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:59.240]   with their user interface, they might migrate it into Vista.
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.440]   Well, the thing that I liked about, or at least
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.320]   the demos of the Xbox--
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:07.560]   If you have an HD, by the way, the Xbox is an HD.
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:08.640]   Which is nice.
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:10.800]   For 720p out of the box, that's a nice--
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:14.000]   So it looks very good on a computer screen.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   But anyway, they have it set up so you can run--
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.120]   if you run it on a network, they want you to network it.
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:21.680]   So you say you're networking on your home network somehow,
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:24.800]   with wireless or whatever.
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:29.040]   It coordinates with a media PC someplace else in the house
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:31.640]   so you can have all your slides, shows, and all kinds of videos.
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:34.320]   And you can move TV onto through it.
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.840]   And it gets all kinds of interesting features.
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:41.000]   This is well thought out this product.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.040]   And I think it should do well if they just
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.680]   have a couple of blockbuster games for it.
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:47.800]   Is Microsoft selling it a loss?
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:49.200]   I wonder myself.
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:49.840]   Three--
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:54.200]   It's got three-- three gigahertz power PC processors in it.
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:54.720]   You know--
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.040]   There's a RAM, a 20 gig hardware.
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:57.880]   Historically, these boxes have always
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:59.560]   been sold at a loss.
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:01.840]   So it surprised me if it wasn't.
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.720]   But this is an expensive loss.
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.720]   Because this thing, the loaded one--
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.800]   It's $400.
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.360]   Well, if you get the big hard disk and the wireless
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:14.040]   and you put everything in it, it's almost $1,000.
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:15.840]   It's a computer.
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:17.120]   Yeah, well, it is a computer.
[00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:19.240]   Well, the original Xbox was cracked.
[00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:23.280]   The copy protection was cracked within a week
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:26.560]   by Bunny Wong, the MIT grad student.
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.680]   I wonder how long it will take before.
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:32.320]   I'm sure as soon as the 360 is out, people will try to crack it.
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:33.800]   Yeah, what are you going to crack it for?
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:35.160]   What are you going to run on it?
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.280]   It's a bunch of power PC chips.
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:37.640]   You're going to put the Mac OS on it?
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:38.680]   Or you're not going to put Windows?
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:39.640]   Well, I think Linux.
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.360]   I think people would probably be interested in putting their own OS
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:42.560]   on it.
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:43.920]   What happened the last time, of course,
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:46.280]   is they created their own dashboard.
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:51.120]   And we're able to copy games under the hard drive and unlock them.
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.520]   Of course, this time, a lot of the capabilities
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:56.560]   that that hack put on the old Xbox has already built in.
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:59.800]   Things like showing slides and playing music.
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:02.320]   But one thing that people want, obviously, is to crack the--
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.080]   I think it just benefits Microsoft.
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.080]   It creates a whole interesting underground.
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.720]   People want it in order to play with it and crack it that way.
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.120]   You know, it doesn't really hurt.
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:13.600]   That's what people said about the old Xbox crack, which
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.320]   is that Microsoft was watching carefully
[00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:18.000]   and built features in that people wanted based
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.920]   on what they were doing with the crack.
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.840]   Yeah, but there's also one element that where Microsoft doesn't want this.
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:25.000]   And that is what they're online gaming.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.080]   They don't want it so people can cheat in these environments.
[00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:33.080]   Because these environments become their own little worlds.
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.200]   They have a net value on eBay.
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:36.040]   Yeah, no, it's a big problem.
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:36.800]   You can't.
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:37.880]   Right, you just can't go in there.
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:39.760]   And the next thing you know, you walk out a millionaire
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.560]   and then go to eBay and sell your position.
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:43.760]   Oh, you're loot.
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:47.160]   Item 3, Microsoft Office 2006 is out in beta.
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:50.880]   And lo and behold, by-by menu bars,
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:54.960]   Microsoft is changing the user interface in Office.
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:56.320]   And I have to think this is something
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:58.680]   they're looking at for Vista as well.
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:00.560]   No more menu bars.
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:01.720]   Have you seen this, you guys?
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:04.480]   I can't imagine how it works on a menu.
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:07.200]   You've got these context sense--
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.200]   Microsoft doesn't seem to like menus much anyway.
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:11.400]   We remember the personalized menus.
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:16.440]   This has a kind of a context sensitive tab bar with functions
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.440]   like write, page layout, and review.
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:20.040]   And you click the tab bar.
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:22.240]   And then it'll have context sensitive items.
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:23.600]   But at no point do you have a menu
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.440]   where you can see all the commands all at once.
[00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.200]   I think it's terrible because I use the menu
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.480]   to figure out what I could do.
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:30.280]   Exactly.
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:31.840]   It's sort of the way you use a GUI
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:33.520]   in order to bring yourself up to speed
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:34.640]   without reading the manual.
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:37.720]   We haven't seen this so we don't know that it's bad.
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:39.480]   Yeah.
[00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:40.960]   I mean, it might be great.
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:41.680]   Yeah, I suppose.
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:42.600]   I mean, I've seen it.
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:43.440]   I haven't played with it.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:44.440]   I mean, that's a long shot, but it might be.
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:44.800]   No.
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:47.640]   Well, I'm looking at the piece.
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:50.000]   I haven't played with it for any extensive period.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.960]   I mean, I've only seen screenshots of it.
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:55.040]   I'll have to download it.
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.520]   I mean, the companies get in desperate.
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.080]   That's a big shift.
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.120]   Well, they're getting desperate to make this thing different
[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:04.840]   in every so often so they can kind of reinvigorate the cash
[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:05.840]   cow.
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:08.720]   And I guess this is their latest idea.
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:10.640]   Yeah, well, in fact, according to PC Magazine,
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:12.640]   most of the changes are user interface.
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.480]   There's not a whole lot different.
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.720]   They just made it look different.
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:17.720]   I wish they would do something about PowerPoint
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.840]   and make it a little more interesting.
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:20.840]   That could be.
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:22.960]   I use keynote now from the Macintosh.
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.720]   And it really is nice because people who are so bored
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:28.720]   with PowerPoint presentations, you load up a PowerPoint slide.
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.560]   People have seen it all.
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:32.000]   Yeah, you can't do anything new.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.040]   No, and people hate it.
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.520]   They go, oh, god, another--
[00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:36.480]   so I always use keynote because at least that's
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:39.000]   going to give them somewhat of a different look and feel.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.440]   Yeah, well, I mean, I've started to put little movie clips
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.280]   in the PowerPoint show that helps a little bit.
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.040]   Yeah, yeah, that's one way to do it.
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:46.600]   Of course, half the time, they don't start
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:47.440]   like they're supposed to.
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:48.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:50.360]   That's another issue entirely.
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:51.840]   That's true of keynote as well.
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:54.360]   I was trying to play some audio in my presentation
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:55.480]   and I couldn't get it started.
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.320]   I couldn't get it started.
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:57.000]   Finally, it does.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.600]   And of course, then it's too loud.
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:03.680]   So what do you guys think about the issue of presentation,
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:05.120]   appearance versus content?
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:08.440]   I mean, it really ought to be what's on the slide, right?
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:11.560]   Edward, is it tough to hear tough?
[00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:14.040]   The king of this is coming to town,
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.080]   and I would really like to get--
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:16.200]   Oh, let's get him on the show.
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.280]   Yeah, he's coming next month.
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:18.400]   Yeah, I'm going that guy forever.
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.600]   Do you know him?
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.400]   Well, you see, we used to correspond a lot
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:25.920]   when I was writing my columns maybe 10 years ago or so
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:27.920]   when he was first getting his reputation.
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:29.600]   Well, I haven't heard from him for a while.
[00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:33.240]   He's still around, and he's coming to town to speak.
[00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:37.720]   And of course, he wrote what is considered a classic called
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:40.600]   the visual display of quantitative information,
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:43.680]   something like that, on how to make these PowerPoint
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.040]   presentations contain information
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.680]   instead of just looking good.
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.000]   It's kind of the classic.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.720]   The thing is, over the years, I get a lot of speeches,
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:55.200]   and over the years, I've used everything.
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.440]   If I've produced films and put them off--
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.520]   You used to use your amiga.
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.440]   You used to-- right, you're a video toaster,
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.360]   and you make some presentations that way.
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:06.440]   Also, I spoke without PowerPoint for a while
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:07.400]   is he because-- How was that?
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:08.560]   Because I'm thinking of doing that.
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:09.880]   No, don't do it.
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:11.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.520]   I'll tell you why.
[00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:14.920]   I'll tell you why.
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:16.960]   Like at all fashion speech.
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.040]   It doesn't work.
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:19.240]   It doesn't work.
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:23.400]   What happens is people are so used to looking for some
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.920]   diversion, some power, something up on the screen,
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:28.080]   that if you think you're going to stand up there in this day
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.000]   and age and entertain people, you better be the best speaker
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:31.920]   in the world.
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:36.080]   I mean, because when you're just up there talking cold
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:39.600]   with nothing for somebody to glance at or any talking notes,
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.120]   you either have to be looking down a lot
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:42.720]   because you've got to see what you're going to be talking
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:43.360]   about.
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:45.360]   With PowerPoint, you just look at the slide because it just
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:47.560]   triggers what your thoughts are.
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:50.200]   I mean, this is, of course, normal professional speaking
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.680]   where you're not just sitting there reading a paper,
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.800]   which as far as I'm concerned, I don't understand why people
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:56.400]   even give a speech like that, as far as--
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:57.640]   I think I just read it.
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:58.720]   Mail it to me.
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:22:59.640]   Exactly.
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:00.920]   Just hand it out.
[00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:01.560]   Yeah, hand it out.
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:02.880]   I don't need to have you read it.
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:04.400]   And most of these people can't read very well.
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:05.160]   I do like you.
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:07.760]   I find myself using more video, audio, multimedia,
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:08.800]   and fewer slides.
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:10.200]   I don't put a lot of text on slides,
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:11.200]   and I don't use as many slides.
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.200]   Well, I just use them as talking points.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.360]   And people can refer to them, or sometimes they
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.640]   want to see the slideshow, or they
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:18.800]   want to download it afterwards, or whatever.
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:20.400]   But if you think you can go out there
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:22.440]   and give cold speeches without PowerPoints,
[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:24.520]   and this day and age to these audiences,
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:25.800]   it's a huge mistake.
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.400]   You've got to have something.
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:28.800]   But then I mean, I have to be PowerPoints.
[00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.840]   There's got to be something up there.
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:31.880]   And that's just the way it is.
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:34.280]   I mean, I've-- to experiment with, I get really--
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:36.440]   you do not get the good-- you don't get the results
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:39.320]   you're looking for when you just stand up there
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:40.520]   and pontificate.
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:44.120]   Maybe this is a product opportunity for a good product.
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:46.680]   Because PowerPoint isn't really as good as it ought to be.
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:48.280]   I got to press release the other day.
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:50.040]   Somebody has just done something.
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:52.280]   And again, yes, another one of the things I can't remember.
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:54.400]   But I sent him a note back saying, I want to copy this
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:54.880]   immediately.
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.920]   And as soon as I get it, we'll talk about it on the show.
[00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:59.080]   But it's a PowerPoint competitor.
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:23:59.760]   It just came out.
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:00.480]   It was coming out.
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.440]   I think you'd do very well if you came up with something
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:05.760]   that just looked different, even if it had the same capabilities,
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:08.400]   but it just had a different feel to it.
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.760]   People would be happy.
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.080]   Well, actually, there's a couple of things out there.
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:13.360]   There's a couple of--
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:17.440]   I mean, things that modify the PowerPoint just a little bit.
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.320]   I think it's called Ovation from those guys
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:22.760]   at Sirius Magic up in Sacramento.
[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:23.680]   You can download that.
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:25.040]   It's a beta.
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:27.960]   It's in beta right now.
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:29.840]   Michael Miller was telling me about it.
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:31.880]   I've downloaded it, but unfortunately, I had something--
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:34.600]   some other plug-in, and I never got it to work.
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:35.280]   But it's beta.
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:36.000]   I mean, I can't--
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.440]   But it's got to be more than another template.
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.800]   It's got to kind of really change the way--
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:40.880]   This is like the thing that changes the model.
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:41.880]   Yeah, yeah, that's how it works.
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:43.120]   But it still works off a PowerPoint.
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:43.600]   Right.
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:45.200]   I'd rather see something all new.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:47.440]   Well, if it looks different enough, I guess that's fine.
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:50.800]   I mean, Google base, have you looked at it?
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:51.960]   It's speaking of looking different.
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:55.560]   This thing-- I don't get this at all.
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:56.600]   Would you explain this to me?
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:58.160]   It's now alive.
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:00.440]   Steve, you tell him, because I didn't even pay any--
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:01.840]   Do you know what it is?
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:02.880]   Test it over.
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.480]   No, I have no idea either, Leo.
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:07.240]   Well, then maybe we won't talk about it.
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:08.800]   I think what's happening at Google
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.120]   is they're just pushing stuff out of the labs now, sometimes
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.640]   with no good reason.
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:14.880]   This is the one everybody was saying
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:17.920]   is going to kill eBay or kill classified ads.
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:19.640]   And let me get my son to see if he knows about it,
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.160]   because he plays it all this crap.
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.720]   And Google base was initially released,
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:24.920]   and then it was like disappeared.
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:26.040]   You're getting it real quickly.
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:26.240]   Yeah.
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:27.560]   Like a few hours or something, right?
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:29.840]   Yeah, it's base.google.com.
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:33.280]   And I guess, play on database, it's
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:34.640]   kind of a separate part of Google
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.840]   that you can search individually.
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:40.760]   And as examples of things that they want you to put there,
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:43.400]   is course schedules, articles.
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:46.440]   Of course, wanted ads, vehicles, rentals,
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:49.080]   the standards of classified ads.
[00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:50.880]   So the sorts of things that individuals
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:52.840]   might have on their own websites,
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:55.960]   they're trying to host that kind of content?
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:58.480]   Yeah, but there's no real formatting.
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:01.640]   And I mean, Google's already searching your--
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.040]   I'm not sure I understand it.
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:03.880]   Google's already--
[00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:05.880]   It's my son.
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:09.600]   He says it's just basically Craigslist, you know, done by Google.
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:10.120]   Yeah.
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:11.120]   I've heard this before.
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:12.640]   I think it's more than that.
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:15.280]   I mean, it doesn't have to be stuff for sale.
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:16.560]   It could be articles.
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:19.000]   Well, no, that's the same thing with Craigslist.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.520]   Craigslist is a lot of discussion for one.
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:22.040]   Oh, that's true.
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:22.520]   All right.
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.520]   Yeah, yeah, right.
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:24.840]   But anyway, he says if anybody out there really
[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:27.160]   wants to know what's happening, go to Metafilter.
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:28.480]   There's a ton of discussions on it.
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:29.120]   OK.
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:30.520]   Yeah, Metafilter's always a good place
[00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:32.000]   to go if you want to know what's happening.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.360]   Well, mostly.
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:35.480]   So we talked a little bit about it,
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:37.800]   and I thought I should just kind of circle around
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:43.040]   on the attempt by some to get the United Nations in control
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:45.280]   of the internet.
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:46.640]   It's been overturned.
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:47.080]   Good.
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:49.000]   I can retain control.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.680]   I ran into an op-ed that ran on one of the big newspapers
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:54.000]   from some tech writer.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.760]   And he's talking about how it's important that we give it
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.640]   to the UN and all this other crap.
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:02.840]   And I'm thinking this really makes zero sense to me.
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:06.080]   I mean, it's not broken.
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:07.840]   What are we trying to do with this?
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:09.360]   I mean, it works fine the way it is.
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:10.880]   It's not bothering anybody.
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.400]   We're not using it to bludgeon people.
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:17.840]   I mean, it's not like our control of it is a big deal.
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:19.040]   Well, I can also understand.
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:21.600]   It may be, in fact, it's just other governments
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.040]   trying to get a little wedge in.
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.800]   And it may, in fact, have been a very terrible idea.
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:30.200]   But I guess I can understand that if they feel like the internet
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:32.560]   is US centric, maybe--
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:33.000]   I don't know.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:33.560]   I can't justify it.
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:34.520]   We invented something.
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:36.080]   Of course it's US centric.
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:39.760]   Well, I mean, China will take it over anyway.
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:44.280]   You do ultimately have the problem of a committee
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:46.920]   that just is going to end up tearing itself apart
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:49.640]   because they're trying to do too many things at once.
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:52.840]   And I think it's exactly as John says, it's working.
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:54.760]   We already have weird little problems like--
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:03.160]   who was it who networked solutions, who tried to change
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:06.040]   the way the roots were working?
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:09.440]   So non-existing domains all went to their own little search
[00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:10.600]   facility.
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:13.320]   And it would be a disaster.
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:17.520]   Well, I was also down in Southern California
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:19.080]   talking with the ICANN people.
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:23.560]   And they say that the people that have been trying
[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:26.000]   to take over the internet-- if you talk to them,
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.720]   they're technically incompetent.
[00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.800]   And most of them-- their fear is that the DNS system
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:33.000]   would be ruined by these people.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.120]   I mean, it's likely that their incompetence could just
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:40.320]   completely ruin the internet if we gave control
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:42.800]   to some international body that doesn't know what they're
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:43.200]   doing.
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.320]   On the other hand, as Steve has pointed out in the past,
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:47.600]   the internet is kind of a house of cards anyway.
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:51.640]   The DNS system isn't all that robust to begin with.
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:52.680]   Yeah, it's old.
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:53.880]   But it's there.
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:58.600]   I mean, it's asking your mom to type
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:01.400]   http/kol/www--
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:02.800]   That's a bad idea.
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:04.680]   --before you get started.
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:07.280]   It's just like, OK, well, this really wasn't designed
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:08.320]   for prime time.
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:11.160]   Yeah, but you don't really have to take that anymore.
[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:14.560]   Every browser pops it in for you.
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:15.720]   I do agree.
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:16.680]   It's kind of silly.
[00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:17.760]   It still exposes that.
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:19.160]   You still see it.
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:21.120]   So even if you don't type it, you see it.
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:23.520]   And I think that that is kind of an unusually--
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.640]   But we're stuck with it.
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:27.280]   So one last story.
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:28.600]   One last story.
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:31.120]   Think secret and other Mac rumor sites are saying.
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:32.880]   And they say they've got from the same source.
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:35.160]   They got other great scoops from that were reliable
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:38.080]   that the first Intel Macs will debut at Macworld.
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:41.640]   It will be the low end Macs, starting with the iBook.
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:43.000]   You think it's credible?
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.160]   Intel Macs at Macworld.
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:46.480]   That's sooner than they said.
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.360]   Yeah.
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:49.160]   I thought I think it's totally credible.
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:50.720]   But I know if it's going to be an iBook.
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:53.160]   I think it's going to be a Mac mini.
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.840]   Well, here's what Apple has said.
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:55.320]   Makes more sense.
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:58.920]   The announcement was mid-2006 for the low end Macs
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:01.320]   and mid-2007 for the high end Macs.
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:02.680]   Certainly makes sense to do the low end.
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:05.880]   And of course, Apple of late hasn't made anything but consumer
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:06.800]   announcements at Macworld.
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:08.480]   They don't announce pro products at Macworld.
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.280]   So I could see a Mac mini.
[00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:11.400]   I could even see an iMac.
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:14.600]   The new iMac that they released, which is pretty slick,
[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:15.320]   is thinner.
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:17.080]   And some say the form factor is designed
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:18.480]   to slip in an Intel motherboard.
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:20.840]   So it could be even an iMac.
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:22.040]   I wouldn't be surprised.
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:25.240]   And the benefit from the consumer standpoint
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.320]   is just based on the Pentium.
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:30.200]   It's lower power, more performance.
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:33.160]   Well, I think for an iBook, the best benefit
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.440]   is you get a Pentium M. There's never
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:37.400]   been a low power chip, a decent low power chip for Apple's
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:38.240]   portables.
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:38.600]   Right.
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:39.280]   That would help.
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:40.280]   So a huge improvement.
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:42.600]   You guys use our battery life, all of a sudden.
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:46.880]   Steve, have you installed the Mac OS86 for OSX86
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.800]   for on a machine yet?
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:49.560]   No, I never did.
[00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:52.800]   Although we had somebody up at Tech TV a couple of months ago.
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:54.400]   We did it on call for help, yeah.
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:54.880]   Yeah.
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:56.720]   Everybody says it runs faster.
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.240]   That's what's interesting is after--
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:02.520]   Isn't this going to create some sort of public relations
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:05.280]   problem from Apple, who's always been all this time
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:07.360]   talking about how this other chip is so much better
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:08.960]   and now it runs faster on the--
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:13.040]   After all this fun, finally the truth comes out.
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:13.880]   Well, even--
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:16.640]   I mean, this is the Steve Jobs reality distortion field.
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:17.680]   He's very good at this.
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:18.680]   Well, and I'll--
[00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:20.040]   You could switch on a dime.
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:23.080]   It may well be that Intel has continued
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.320]   to push the technology forward and that Apple was
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:28.080]   leaving the power PC because it was pretty much of a dead end
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:28.880]   architect.
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:29.880]   That's the story.
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:30.680]   Yeah, that's it.
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.320]   It wasn't faster before, but it is.
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:33.320]   No, it isn't.
[00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:36.040]   Yeah, I think you just helped him with a spin.
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:37.040]   That's good.
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:38.760]   I think it would be a big coup for Apple.
[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:42.840]   I mean, if I were Apple, I would have been given
[00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:46.200]   a very conservative deadlines and then come out early.
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:47.040]   That looks good, right?
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:48.320]   It looks like they're on top of it.
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:51.120]   And John, you never think that they will willingly
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:56.040]   divorce the OS from the hardware and create a box like Solaris
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:58.160]   tried to do that would just run on a PC?
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:04.440]   I'm convinced that when they finally get a clue,
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:09.440]   they're going to make a premium product for the Apple lovers,
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:12.040]   which is what they make now and probably hold the same market
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.600]   chair or maybe even increase it a little bit because it might
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:18.360]   be a machine, for example, an x86 machine running a Mac OS.
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:20.720]   It might be some I'd be interested in, especially
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:22.160]   if I could dual boot it.
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:23.280]   I don't want dual boot.
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:24.400]   I want seamless windows.
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:26.240]   I want a Windows--
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:28.280]   I want to be able to be running OS 10 and double click
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:31.480]   a Windows application and it runs in its own window.
[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:33.240]   And I've got Windows running on the same table.
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:34.480]   You know, it's very doable.
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:36.520]   And I think it would be very cool.
[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:37.400]   Terrain doable.
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:37.800]   Yep.
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:40.680]   There is enough virtualization technology now that's sort of
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:43.320]   been creeping out, but that's just not hard to do.
[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:45.640]   And that is a very compelling product.
[00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:48.280]   It's talking about solving the switch problem.
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:50.440]   The one thing keeping people from switching at this point
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:52.840]   is that one Windows app, they can't get on Mac.
[00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:53.720]   Exactly.
[00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:57.360]   Now, anyway, once they get a clue, if they could just come
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:00.160]   to the conclusion that I keep coming to, which is that they
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:02.520]   would keep the same market chair or it maybe even
[00:33:02.520 --> 00:33:05.720]   increase it by selling these expensive Macintosh machines
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:11.080]   with the x86 processor in it and running x86 operating system.
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:14.200]   And let the operating system also be sold as an individual
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:18.000]   product for $99 or whatever for everybody else, I think they
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.560]   would eventually take over the entire business and still
[00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:23.160]   have a hardware business that would be at least as big as
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:24.880]   they have now, if not bigger.
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:26.920]   And they would impinge on Microsoft.
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:32.320]   And I still see the future being Linux on servers, OS x86
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:37.040]   on the desktop, and office applications owned by Microsoft.
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.040]   That seems reasonable.
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.120]   That's amazing.
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:40.320]   It's a nice world.
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:41.360]   Yeah.
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:42.440]   All right, thanksgiving.
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:44.000]   Our lab-- we're going to wrap this up.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.080]   Thanksgiving is coming up on Thursday.
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:49.560]   Just thinking I'll maybe ask you guys, each of you, what
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:55.080]   you're thankful for in this tech industry this year.
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:57.240]   Anything to be thankful for, John C. Devora?
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:58.800]   Well, I think it's ramping up again.
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:02.160]   And I'm also thankful for high speed wireless, since I'm
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.480]   in the back room now.
[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:08.920]   But I think we're going to see another bubble, and I think
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:09.760]   it's going to be a lot of fun.
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:11.440]   We're just going to have to be a little more careful this time
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:11.960]   around.
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:12.760]   And I think we will be.
[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:15.240]   And I think we're exactly en route to do that.
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:16.800]   We've built the infrastructure.
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:18.440]   Now we get to-- with the first bubble,
[00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:19.840]   and now we can take advantage of it.
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:21.480]   And I think there's amazing stuff happening.
[00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:22.720]   How about you, Steve Gibson?
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:24.280]   Anything to be thankful for this year?
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:25.840]   You know what I'm thankful for, I think,
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:31.720]   is the incredible drop in non-volatile memory pricing.
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:35.360]   The fact that I can now get a little 2 gig SD card
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:37.200]   and put a ton of media on it.
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:38.920]   And it's just-- I mean, it's affordable.
[00:34:38.920 --> 00:34:40.400]   It's just phenomenal.
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:44.480]   And in general, the overall fall of prices,
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:48.520]   you can go out to a fries or a micro center or wherever
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:52.400]   and get some amazing technology for a couple hundred dollars
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:52.920]   now.
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:54.720]   It's really phenomenal.
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:56.600]   You know, the life drive-- because I
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:58.880]   ended up buying the palm with the hard drive built in.
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:00.800]   The life drive has crashed, Steve.
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:04.040]   So I'm going to trade it in for that, Tungsten.
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:04.960]   I think you were right.
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:05.880]   I just bought one.
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:07.760]   I own the TX now, Leo.
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:08.440]   Solid state.
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:09.440]   You know what?
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:11.280]   You guys-- you guys-- you know, the people
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:13.200]   complain about that Tungsten.
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:13.840]   Really?
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:15.440]   You want to like screen busts?
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:17.120]   And there's that-- they still know
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:19.760]   that yellow dot problem isn't that happening, isn't it,
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:20.760]   Ronald?
[00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:21.260]   Uh-oh.
[00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:22.760]   I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:25.400]   But I have 2T5s, and now I have a TX.
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:27.440]   He's going to start stockpiling him
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:28.760]   and putting in the refrigerator again.
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:29.920]   Ah, I love it.
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:30.920]   I never forget.
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:31.920]   I never write a--
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:35.120]   Refrigerator Steve refrigerator gifts.
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:36.240]   Hey, by the way, there's something else
[00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:37.200]   we should be thankful for.
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:38.040]   What's that?
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.840]   University of California 27 Stanford 3.
[00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:43.040]   That was the big game the other day.
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:47.040]   I couldn't let the show go about that rubbing it in.
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:49.680]   John C. Devorak, thank you for joining us.
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:51.440]   Thank you, Steve Gibson.
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:52.400]   It's a skeleton twit.
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.120]   We're going to be back next week after Thanksgiving.
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:57.000]   Probably also have a small crew, but then back full bore
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.120]   with video and more for Twit 32.
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:01.760]   We've got some great things in the works.
[00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.040]   I'll tell you what I'm thankful for.
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:07.920]   The amazing Twit army, which has supported us for 31 shows
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:10.000]   now, and has been such a great audience.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.400]   And we thank you very much for joining us.
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:16.440]   Thanks, too, to AOL and the podcasting channel on AOL
[00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:18.880]   Radio for providing the bandwidth and broadcasting
[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:21.480]   this show at AOLMusic.com.
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:24.480]   Thanks to Ashley Whit for our closing theme,
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:26.480]   Mark Lasko for opening theme and Dorothy M.
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:28.760]   Lotto for the little Twit guy.
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:30.960]   Another Twit is in the can.
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:32.920]   All right.
[00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:33.960]   I should have paid attention.
[00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:35.240]   I don't know what I'm going to do.
[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:35.720]   Too much work.
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:37.480]   The problem is there's no limit.
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:39.200]   My server is completely collapsed.
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:40.480]   So here's the deal.
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:41.720]   I'm just trying to get the thing off,
[00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:45.200]   but I have a hell of a time when blue screens forget it.
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:46.480]   I'm killing you.
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:48.480]   [LAUGHS]
