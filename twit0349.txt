[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.920]   I'm Leo LaCorten.
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.760]   I say that because you're not going to hear another word
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.120]   for me for the next hour and a half.
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.480]   We have such a big panel and such a great panel starting
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.800]   all the way to the left.
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.120]   Actually, we'll do it all the way to the left, that left.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.840]   John C. Devorak, channel Devorak.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.560]   Today I'm celebrating the 400th show of No Agenda.
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.200]   I saw that.
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.720]   That's great.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.360]   Of course, I never listened to a Jenny show.
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.800]   No, you never listened to it.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.160]   I did understand that was your 400th in it.
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.000]   That's great.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.840]   Frank, I'm out.
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:29.480]   We haven't done.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.840]   We've done this as 349.
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.440]   You're beating us.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.200]   You lapped us.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.880]   It helps when you're doing two a week.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:34.600]   Yeah.
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:35.480]   I should try that.
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.960]   No.
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:36.960]   No.
[00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.560]   Really, what do you recommend one or two a week?
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.000]   What do you recommend?
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.240]   For you, you're doing about 40 a week now.
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.760]   I do too many shows as it is.
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.040]   Some people often complain.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.560]   I can't listen to all your shows.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.120]   And I have to say, you don't have to.
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.600]   Why would you want to listen to all of them?
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.600]   We make a variety.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.840]   You have a lot of Leo superfans that do want to listen to you.
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.120]   They want to want them all.
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.120]   Well, hey, I'm not going to--
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.360]   There's a guy that's copying you.
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.880]   I hear him when I'm driving up here.
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.800]   He's on 9/10 K&EW.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.720]   That's me.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.200]   What?
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.360]   That's my tech guy show.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.920]   That's me.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.520]   Crap.
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.160]   Yeah.
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.160]   And you were complaining to me about repeating my jokes.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.280]   Trey Radcliffe is also here, the man from Stuck in Customs
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.320]   who's about to leave us.
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.120]   He's moving to New Zealand in a week.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.720]   But you have the internet.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.160]   They have the internet, but they're a day later.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.660]   Yeah.
[00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.600]   I think the time for things going to hurt you more than you
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.100]   think.
[00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.640]   You think so?
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.640]   Yes.
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.400]   I'll have to plan ahead.
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.000]   You'll have to be up in the middle of the night.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.720]   Why New Zealand?
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.600]   What's going on?
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.760]   Well, I kind of make my living off this blog.
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:37.680]   And StuckinCustoms.com.
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.640]   StuckinCustoms.com.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.960]   Internet connection.
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:40.800]   And I'm good to go.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.200]   I love mountains.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.880]   But you can't get one in Austin?
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.160]   You're going to be in the South Island?
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.800]   South Island.
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.800]   Oh, it's the town.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.800]   It's a good one.
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.280]   Really?
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.680]   I think people are either mountain people
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.920]   or forest people or beaches.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.960]   The South Island has got a prehistoric jungle
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:56.360]   that includes a blue duck, which is unrelated to any duck
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.800]   in the world.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.160]   It's a prehistoric duck.
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.320]   If you got him, the insides are completely different.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:01.000]   Well, don't cut him.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.120]   There won't be any left.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.960]   No, there's plenty there.
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:03.600]   All right.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.280]   So did you go for the blue duck?
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.280]   You go for the blue duck.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.280]   Stay for the kiwi fruit, I guess.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.800]   I don't know.
[00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:10.840]   That's their motto.
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:11.280]   Yeah.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.040]   And you're bringing the whole family.
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.200]   You're moving the whole thing.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:14.880]   I saw--
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:15.440]   White and three kids.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.360]   What's great about Trace?
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.360]   He lives online, so I saw you go to sell your car.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.560]   The whole thing.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.080]   I mean, it's just--
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.520]   Sell it at all.
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:22.040]   Yeah.
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:22.520]   Not at all.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.920]   You'll have a--
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.920]   You'll have a--
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.440]   Our stuff on a big boat, right?
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.600]   Like in this long container.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.840]   Like a--
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:26.480]   You have to time this.
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.360]   So it gets there when you--
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.200]   You'll be back.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.600]   We're like a Chinese exporter.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.280]   Heard you're here for a Panama Canal.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.800]   It's on the way.
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.880]   Is it a container?
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:33.280]   Yeah.
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.400]   Wow.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.640]   Anyways, Trace, one of the great photographers,
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.520]   very popular, knows everybody.
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.400]   Actually brought Thomas Hawke and his wife,
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.920]   and Karen Hutton here.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.960]   So some prestigious people, even in the audience today.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.120]   And he brought the Sony NEX7, which is a mirrorless camera.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.400]   John's a big fan of the EP3.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.840]   And we'll talk a little bit about cameras.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.720]   I'm sure the cameras look like it looks great.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.080]   It really-- in fact, we did a review on before you buy it.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.320]   Tony was very impressive.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.400]   Nice camera.
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.240]   APS-C, right?
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.200]   I mean, it's a big sensor.
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.560]   Yeah.
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.560]   Yeah.
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.680]   It's a big 24 megapixel, too.
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.000]   But it seems like that should be enough for a show to have
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.680]   John and Trey.
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.480]   But look, on my left, Jolie Odell is here from Venturebeat.com.
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.320]   Great to see you.
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.200]   Lovely to be here again.
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.720]   And she brought baked goods, which
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.080]   makes and dares me to you even more if that's possible.
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:18.280]   Thank you for coming.
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:18.800]   I appreciate it.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.320]   Yeah, you're welcome.
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.040]   My pleasure.
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:26.160]   And last but not least, first time on Twitch, a newbie.
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.080]   Padre S.J., you know him in the chat,
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.240]   where his Robert Balaser.
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.640]   He's been on TNT did forecast last week.
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.640]   Absolutely.
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:32.840]   He was great.
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.000]   And I'm so glad you could come up and be here kind of in prompt
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.320]   to.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.400]   I was actually just going to drop off the pizza.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:39.960]   He's got a side job.
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.560]   Anyway, thank you all for being here.
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.000]   We're going to have a great show today.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.360]   We are actually-- as soon as she shows over,
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.480]   I'm leaving for Vegas because we're
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.920]   going to do the coverage of the NAB show,
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.280]   the National Association of Broadcasters Show,
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.360]   starting on Monday.
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.560]   Actually, you probably saw the cannon at a big announcement.
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.880]   They're going to show us their new 4K 1D.
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.240]   Yeah, they got two cameras.
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.320]   They're expensive.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.600]   They're $15,000 and $30,000.
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.240]   They're not cheap.
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.640]   But-- and they're aiming him, not at still photographers.
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:08.880]   I think it's kind of interesting.
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.000]   They're aiming him at cinematographers.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   Yeah, they're trying to take over the--
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.720]   What camera is this again?
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:16.280]   It's their replacement for the 1D.
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.080]   Oh, that's--
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.360]   And then there's something-- what is it?
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.720]   The C500 they're calling it?
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:20.880]   Yeah, C500.
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:25.600]   And video is a different beast than a photo.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.960]   Although they're still-- I mean, it's funny.
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.360]   They still have the form factor of a DSLR.
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.200]   But now they've got a viewfinder.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.080]   They've got accessorizes.
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:33.320]   It's kind of-- there you go.
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.120]   They've been influenced by--
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.920]   obviously by the red and the scarler.
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.160]   They're trying to take away from the red.
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.160]   The red's a little bit more expensive, the epic.
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.960]   The scarlet is about the same price.
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:43.460]   Right.
[00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.920]   So 4K means you can shoot video that
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:51.560]   is four times higher definition than HD, which is amazing.
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.600]   Yeah, it's crazy.
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:56.360]   I think it's mostly for movie, film, type people.
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.640]   But at 15K, it's getting closer to something
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:00.920]   that we might consider.
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.280]   When we bought our cameras, and we have quite a few of them,
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.480]   I think, 30 or 40.
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.280]   You have a lot of cameras in this place.
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.640]   We do, because they're cheaper than camera men, camera operators.
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.960]   So we just have lockdown cameras.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.520]   But these are $1,500 Can and Vixi.
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.160]   Is there cheap consumer grade?
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.000]   Because I did not want to invest in anything.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.480]   Because I figured the cameras like this
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.240]   will be affordable in four or five years, right?
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.000]   Yeah, I think you can hang on to what you have for another two
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:25.560]   or three years.
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.400]   We'll stay HD and come to this on eBay.
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.280]   Yeah, we'll be 4K in a few years.
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.560]   Wow.
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.520]   By the time you get back from New Zealand.
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.680]   Yeah, which will be any minute.
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.800]   So let's start.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.400]   Let's start.
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.000]   Because the big story-- and I apologize for people
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.440]   who listen to all our shows.
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.000]   Because this story broke Monday, the day after last week's
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:44.600]   Twitter.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.960]   So if you listen to all your shows,
[00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.560]   we've gone through every show now to talk about this story.
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:51.120]   But we haven't done it yet on Twitter.
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:51.800]   And we need to.
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.760]   And I've got a great panel to talk about it.
[00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:55.720]   Instagram, selling to Facebook.
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:59.400]   This company's 15 months old, 12 employees.
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.880]   They are an iOS app recently released in Android app.
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:04.720]   Boy, we couldn't have a better panel here to talk about it.
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:08.600]   We've got one of the great photographers here.
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:10.840]   $1 billion.
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.840]   Now, you're not going to preoccupy yourself
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.480]   with the price, with the money, that's floating around.
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.960]   Because you did that on the show, on the radio.
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.120]   Hard not to.
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.360]   But I mean, you just was--
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.960]   If it were $999 million, it would be the same story.
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:22.960]   You said that exact same thing.
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.440]   I'm not going to get the price round number.
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.600]   But don't you think it's a materialistic analysis?
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.920]   And we should be looking at the possible reasons
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.240]   that they did this rather than--
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.880]   Anything with $1 billion is materialistic.
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.000]   I don't care what.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.960]   All right, according to the Verge, Dante Orazio writing,
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:43.000]   it took Mark Zuckerberg two days to make this deal.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.800]   You think it was a rush to judgment?
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.240]   No, I don't think he wanted anyone else to start a bidding war.
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:48.880]   I think they just--
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:49.520]   Is that what it was?
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.320]   Yeah, no, I can't believe there'd be a bidding war.
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.560]   New York Times said--
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.400]   I believe it was defensive, but I don't believe
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:55.520]   there would be a bidding war.
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:56.920]   Not at that price.
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:57.360]   The company--
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.520]   The whole story is just so ridiculous.
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.960]   Company had just been valued at $500 million
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:01.560]   a couple months ago.
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.760]   Also ridiculous.
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.640]   It's a picture sharing mobile app.
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:05.560]   It's an app.
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:06.080]   All it's--
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.240]   It's not even a website.
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.720]   It's not anything.
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:10.600]   Yes, it has a lot of users.
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.280]   But every one of those users, Jolie,
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.640]   doesn't every one of those users probably
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:14.720]   a Facebook member already?
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.280]   I mean, doesn't Facebook know more about that?
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:16.800]   Yes, it's true now.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.000]   Which gives it away.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:18.520]   No, it's true.
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.600]   But it's a series of filters.
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.000]   It's a series of filters.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.520]   It's a series of filters.
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:25.760]   In the IPO filing documents, everybody was saying, oh, you know,
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.760]   mobile is Facebook's biggest weakness
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.160]   when you're talking about investors
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.840]   and publicly traded Facebook stock.
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.760]   So this is Facebook saying, hey, no, we can do mobile.
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.400]   Look, we bought a big mobile company for a billion dollars.
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:38.920]   Isn't that competent of us?
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:39.880]   And maybe it is.
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.480]   Sure, I'm not privy to those discussions.
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:42.960]   But it's so bubbly.
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:44.320]   I talked to people who lived--
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.120]   Bubbly, in the sense of like a stock bubble.
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.200]   I lived over five bubbly.
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.400]   I talked with people who went through the '90s.com bust.
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.120]   And they said--
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.320]   You were 12 at the time.
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.440]   So you remember it?
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:53.440]   No.
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.200]   darling, I was working on my first computer job.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:55.760]   Were you already?
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:56.280]   Yeah, I was.
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.400]   I had my first startup job in 1999.
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.120]   So you lived through this, actually?
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:02.120]   And I look.
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:02.640]   Yes.
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.600]   So no, but everyone who is from that era is saying, OK,
[00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:08.280]   this is the kind of deal that makes people terrified
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.720]   that our whole internet economy is going to collapse again.
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:11.720]   OK, it's overheated.
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:12.760]   Oh, god, it's ridiculous.
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:13.920]   A billion dollars.
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:14.480]   No, wait a minute.
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.520]   I think with the brains at this table,
[00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:18.400]   we could figure out why.
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.360]   I had a good column in MarketWatch about this.
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.240]   Why did this happen?
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:23.560]   Because the number of users--
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.600]   like, I think you said on your other show--
[00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.360]   30 million.
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.320]   --are all Facebook users already.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.400]   And it was-- they were ripe for the plucking.
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.160]   Google could have grabbed them all and picked up 33 million
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.880]   people right off the top.
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:38.440]   And Facebook is starting to exhibit the Microsoft
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.040]   paranoia qualities.
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.120]   And I think this is one evidence of it.
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.280]   They are getting just-- and Google is showing this, too.
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:47.400]   They're paranoid about things going on around them.
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.760]   Because, oh, they're making so much money,
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.840]   they can't even consider the possibility
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:52.880]   that the competition might be good for them.
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.400]   So they did a defensive move, grabbed this thing
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.440]   out of sheer paranoia.
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.240]   And for as I'm concerned, pulled a Yahoo.
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.680]   This is the broadcast.com.
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.000]   This is broadcast.com, exactly.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:03.760]   It's a broadcast.com.
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.400]   How long before Kevin Sister and the CEO
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:07.040]   of Instagram buys the Portland Trailblazers
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.600]   and runs onto the court throwing chairs?
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.720]   It's a matter of months.
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.760]   They have to buy him from Paul Allen, who won't sell him.
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.440]   But they could buy the Seattle team, which is moved to--
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.440]   or they could create a new Seattle team, because the other teams
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.560]   moved to Oklahoma City.
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:18.440]   There you go.
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:20.440]   Taking the devil's advocate side,
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.480]   it's really easy to look at this and say, obviously,
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.160]   they overpaid.
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.640]   I'm a billion dollars for a couple of filters
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:28.360]   and a few users that Facebook probably already has.
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.080]   It seems like a lot of money.
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:33.440]   But this is a particularly vulnerable time for Facebook.
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.480]   They are in IPO land now.
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:38.600]   And they don't want any competition when the IPO finally
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:39.280]   hits.
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:42.160]   They don't want any questions about whether or not
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.120]   they are the number one mobile space.
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.800]   Well, is it really competition when all of the Instagram photos
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:47.800]   get pushed to Facebook?
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.560]   And Facebook is the one that monetizes those.
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:52.760]   It would be if Twitter or Google+ bought them
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:55.080]   and flipped that little switch there.
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:57.800]   But didn't Twitter just buy a photo sharing?
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.800]   Well, certainly Twitter couldn't afford a billion dollars.
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:00.680]   They didn't buy a twit pick.
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.160]   Which one did they buy?
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:02.480]   I don't know.
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.920]   Anyhow, Twitter bought one.
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:05.240]   Facebook bought one.
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.120]   I'm going to go buy one.
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.240]   It doesn't even matter.
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.240]   According to The Times, Mr. Zuckerberg--
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.520]   that's how you know it's The Times--
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.280]   Mr. Zuckerberg--
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.600]   paid place to call on Friday--
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.240]   last Friday, a week ago-- to Kevin's system,
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.480]   the CEO and founder of Instagram.
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.280]   And a very nice guy.
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.920]   We interviewed him when Instagram came out.
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:25.080]   And he was still one of us.
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:27.840]   According to people with knowledge of the matter,
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:29.480]   who spoke on condition of anonymity
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.120]   because of discussions for private,
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:33.320]   Mr. Zuckerberg was blunt, they said.
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:37.000]   A Facebook wanted to buy Instagram over the next 48 hours.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:40.320]   Facebook and Instagram hammered out the details
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:43.200]   for a $1 billion cash and stock deal.
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.400]   You got to-- I can imagine that call.
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:46.200]   Hi, Kevin.
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:50.160]   It's Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:52.120]   Yeah, Mark Zuckerberg, yeah.
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.960]   Hey, I want to buy you.
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:57.120]   And Kevin thinks, hmm, I don't want to sell.
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:00.160]   Sure, Mark, it'll be a billion dollars.
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:00.760]   OK.
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:02.880]   Where do I send the check?
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.640]   You can't turn down a billion dollars.
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:06.760]   Maybe it's already said a million.
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:10.080]   Well, I think that's what happened.
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.680]   I think Kevin said, yeah, yeah, sure.
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:12.520]   A billion dollars.
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:14.160]   And Mark said, he didn't blink.
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:14.600]   Yeah, sure.
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.400]   Well, here's a vector.
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.360]   But he gone for 1.5.
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.400]   Here's something that no one's really talking about.
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:23.160]   And I think something's happening right in front of us,
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.000]   right underneath us.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.760]   And no one really understands it.
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:27.320]   But I think the way humans are starting
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:29.960]   to communicate with each other is evolving.
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.160]   It's going to visual, isn't it?
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:34.120]   It's becoming a picture-sharing society.
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:34.620]   Right.
[00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:36.800]   You know, for years, ever since Gutenberg, right,
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.840]   at the printing press, we've been converting concepts
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:41.560]   into words and paragraphs.
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.840]   And that's how we've communicated.
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.720]   In fact, that's how we've communicated on the web forever.
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.240]   But if things continue at their current rate
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.480]   and we're sharing more and more photos,
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:53.200]   you can communicate concepts and stories and ideas
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:56.040]   with photos almost as effectively as words.
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.360]   It's not better or worse than words.
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:13:59.320]   It's just different.
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:00.600]   It's faster.
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:01.760]   It's easier.
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.120]   And it's more mobile-friendly.
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:04.320]   And I think that's very important.
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:04.800]   Very much so.
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:05.920]   Hugely important, yeah.
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.680]   In fact, as you say that, Trey, I think about my use.
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:10.680]   I use path and Instagram.
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:13.120]   And I most often will send a picture.
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.440]   And maybe a few words.
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.120]   And look, most everybody now, if you
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.760]   have a streaming type life, right,
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.440]   you just flip through the words until you see
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:21.000]   a picture that's interesting.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.200]   And then you might read some words around it.
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.480]   And Instagram is a pure photo-sharing thing.
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.520]   And if you think about humans, as we develop,
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:31.000]   basically from age three till 10,
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.320]   you're learning this alphanumeric system
[00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:36.280]   and how to convert concepts into cogent sentences.
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:39.160]   That is a huge amount of human development time.
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:42.720]   But what if people just start sharing photos
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:45.560]   to share stories of their life, to share concepts?
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:48.480]   Actually, Pinterest exploits this thought.
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.480]   In fact--
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.480]   It feels like going backwards a little bit
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.480]   into Q&A reform, if you ask--
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.040]   You've got to think Pinterest is probably
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:54.280]   nest on the block, right?
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.360]   How much is Pinterest worth?
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:57.120]   If this is worth a billion dollars,
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:00.800]   this is the popular page right now on Instagram.
[00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.720]   These are the pictures that most people like.
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.080]   This depresses me.
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.880]   This makes me sad for humanity.
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:07.720]   They're not deep.
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:11.840]   It's pictures of food and shoes and weirdos.
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:12.920]   Who is that?
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:14.680]   Well, there's a marriage proposal.
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:15.720]   That's a great thing to do.
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:17.280]   Do it on Instagram, sure.
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:19.000]   Who is he talking to?
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:19.800]   Maybe all of you.
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.360]   There's no question that language continually--
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.200]   That's how the language evolves.
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.960]   We're always changing the way that we're trying
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.560]   to convey meaning.
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:28.440]   But getting back to the main story--
[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:29.440]   I don't see that.
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:31.000]   Thank you, thank you, Potter.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.640]   I'm getting back on the rails.
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:35.880]   Even granted that communication is shifting,
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:39.560]   I don't see the value in a purchase like this.
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.680]   Defensive, is it an act higher?
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:43.240]   Were they looking at a core technology?
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.440]   Is there a patent portfolio?
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.640]   The answer to all those questions is no.
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:49.160]   I think Jolie hit the nail on the head.
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:51.640]   The stock, the IPO's coming up.
[00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:52.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:54.000]   Mark might have said, if we lose this,
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.800]   it could cost us a billion dollars in the IPO.
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:57.760]   It might be worth it.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:59.600]   It's almost like they just spun a roulette wheel
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.200]   and said, OK, Instagram, they're big right now.
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:04.480]   So I mean, give it up for Kevin, the luckiest guy in America.
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:05.640]   $400 million.
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:06.560]   There we go again.
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:07.920]   He gets $400 million out of that.
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:09.480]   Although I found the timing really weird,
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.920]   because I think they collected a significant round
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.840]   of funding, something like a day or two before--
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.680]   Somebody bought in a week before this happened.
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:17.400]   How do you not?
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:18.240]   Happy people.
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:19.080]   That's a lottery ticket.
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:19.880]   Happy people.
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:20.640]   They won a lot of--
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:21.480]   That's probably inside information.
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.520]   With your due diligence, how do you not know?
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:24.840]   I agree with John.
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:27.880]   How do you not know that the company you're investing in
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.680]   is getting acquired by Facebook?
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:30.520]   I don't buy it.
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.440]   I think somebody knew something on a roulette.
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:34.560]   Well, I think that we can take the opposite angle
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.640]   on what she just said, which is not
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:39.360]   that it was to make Facebook look good to the potential
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.760]   investors and save a billion dollars.
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:43.120]   But now, I think potential investors look at it
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:45.400]   and say, well, these guys are kind of crazy.
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.520]   This is a dumb idea.
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:47.880]   This is a stupid thing to do.
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:48.320]   Maybe we should--
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:48.880]   It could hurt them.
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:51.080]   And I'll tell you, I think this is going on with these guys
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:54.160]   are going to do a bunch of non-voting stock IPOs.
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.760]   Google's pulling the stunt--
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.120]   We're going to talk about it lately.
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:57.920]   --which is completely ridiculous.
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:58.720]   That's getting people very upset.
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.760]   In fact, they say that's even the most evil thing--
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:02.560]   given all the evil things Google's done this year,
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:03.280]   that's the most evil.
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:04.120]   We're going to talk about that.
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:06.640]   These retirement funds are going to pull out of Google.
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:07.160]   You watch.
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.280]   CalPERS and things like that.
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:09.200]   And these are big investors.
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.600]   These institutional investors can make a huge difference
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:12.080]   in the valuation.
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:15.120]   Is it a venture pathway just to get into Google?
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:17.040]   Or was that IBM or something else?
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:17.920]   I think it was Google.
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:18.680]   I'm so into Google.
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:19.720]   Let me Google that.
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.480]   You know, there is another angle in the story.
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:24.400]   And that is back when the IPO story was fresh.
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.880]   There was a TNT episode called 57% Zuck.
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.200]   And the whole idea was--
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.200]   Yeah, owns most of it.
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.240]   It's Zuck.
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.920]   If you're investing in Facebook, you're actually
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:33.160]   investing in Zuckerberg.
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:33.680]   Well, I know too.
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.080]   No decision can be made without him.
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:36.920]   So, I mean, does Zuckerberg just
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.720]   have a liking for Instagram?
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.840]   That's kind of what the Times article said.
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:42.840]   Is this just shows--
[00:17:42.840 --> 00:17:44.560]   I want this product so I'm buying it.
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:45.480]   I got a bunch of cash.
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:45.920]   Why not?
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:46.920]   I got the checkbook.
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:49.520]   What else do you think if they can put those stupid filters
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.560]   on Facebook as a Facebook feature,
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:54.200]   wouldn't it make Facebook photo sharing even more popular?
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:54.720]   Yeah.
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:55.220]   Oh, yeah.
[00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:56.840]   But you know, they don't need Instagram to do that.
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:57.600]   It makes it easier.
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:58.480]   You mentioned the other day.
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:17:59.560]   There's dozens of--
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:00.560]   Camera plus.
[00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:01.800]   Did it beforehand?
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:04.640]   You've got-- how many filters in your 100 cameras in one?
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:05.560]   There's 100, Leo.
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:08.400]   It's an amazing thing.
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.240]   So it's not like Instagram has a monoclon.
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:12.240]   It's a coincidence that you named it that.
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:12.740]   I know.
[00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:14.640]   We wrecked our brains trying to come up with another one.
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:17.120]   You know who missed out on this and probably came very close,
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:19.640]   Hipstomatic, which predates Instagram.
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:20.160]   In fact, just--
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.720]   Oh, but I have a little theory about why that happened.
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:25.400]   I think the fact that Instagram was willing to go
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.320]   into Android territory made a huge, huge difference
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:29.960]   in that price especially.
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:31.640]   It happened two weeks before the sale.
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.680]   Two weeks-- three weeks ago, I was at Facebook HQ,
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.680]   and I was talking to them, and they're like, yeah,
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:37.880]   iPhone's a big deal.
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:41.000]   Android is as big a deal, and the mobile web is twice as big--
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.280]   Facebook said this.
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:44.520]   Facebook said this to me, but they showed us the numbers.
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:48.240]   And they also said, we see the entire spectrum
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:51.760]   of mobile access technologies as one and the same.
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:52.640]   They're all kind of people.
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.000]   So that kind of lends credence to the idea
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.800]   that maybe Instagram knew about this ahead of time.
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:01.240]   And maybe Instagram said, quick, get an Android app.
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.320]   Far be it for me to come here and pause it.
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:04.360]   Conscriptive theories.
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:04.760]   That's not--
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:05.880]   No, that's Jon's job.
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:06.920]   Because they put this off.
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:09.640]   I mean, I asked Instagram every time I saw them.
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.280]   Android app Android-- they say, we're working on it.
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.760]   We're working on it.
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:14.320]   The big question for me is, if they
[00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:15.760]   could pay $1 billion for Instagram,
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.760]   why couldn't they throw $100 million at Kodak?
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:21.440]   Just a bone.
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:22.440]   Just a bone.
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:24.240]   Actually Kodak has a looking at there.
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.240]   Right, enterprise value.
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.240]   You'd have to pay $750, $750 million
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.000]   bucks Kodak your own straight up.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:29.840]   Yeah.
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:30.840]   Wow.
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:32.120]   You know, it's kind of speaking of the--
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:33.360]   What should it be more interesting?
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:34.960]   And they have all half of these at, yeah.
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:36.200]   They have filters.
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:39.080]   They're mid-ac-class, but damn.
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:40.400]   I thought it was kind of interesting
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:42.120]   that Instagram is actually worth more than the New York
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:43.120]   times.
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:43.960]   Oh, geez.
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.360]   Yeah, the whole thing is ludicrous.
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.960]   It's bizarre.
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:48.120]   Anyway, we're going to take a break.
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.040]   We've got a great panel.
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:50.680]   We've got Padre S.J. here.
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.200]   We've got Jolio Del here.
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.840]   We've got Trey Ratcliffe here.
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:55.200]   We've got John C. de Vorek.
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.880]   It's a cage match.
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.040]   And I'm going to tag out here, because I've
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:00.880]   got to talk about Stamps.com.
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:02.440]   So Jon, if you want to go base your meter--
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.360]   What are you talking about?
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:09.800]   You always saying, you know, you always give me nothing but grief
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.640]   for leaving, because this is a chance to take a break.
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:13.480]   It's an opportunity.
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:13.920]   I'm saying.
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.400]   Smoke them if you got them.
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.240]   Well, I don't have them.
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:17.880]   Smoke them if you've got anything.
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:19.520]   All right.
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.800]   I'm staying here now.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.560]   It's all kinds of wrong.
[00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.120]   Every way possible.
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.760]   Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to tell you
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:28.680]   how you can avoid going to the post office.
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:29.800]   Do you go to the post office?
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:30.520]   You're asking me?
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:30.960]   Yeah.
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:31.800]   Yeah, of course.
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.040]   No, you shouldn't.
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:33.540]   Why?
[00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:35.520]   Do you know you can print postage from your computer
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:36.520]   with an printer?
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:37.200]   Yeah, I know that.
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.240]   And I can do that too.
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.320]   But the post office is a great social event.
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:41.320]   God, no.
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:41.840]   Please.
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:41.840]   Oh, yes.
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:42.560]   Fantastic.
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:43.480]   Heaven, help us.
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:44.320]   Nice people there.
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.560]   They're actually closing two out of the three post offices
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:47.080]   in Petaluma.
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:47.840]   I imagine the same.
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:50.160]   Why would you need three post offices in a little town
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:50.600]   like this?
[00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:51.240]   That's a good point.
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.480]   Maybe that's why they're closing them.
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:53.240]   I don't know.
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.080]   Now we have a big mail sorting facility,
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:56.880]   and then we have the big post office.
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:57.880]   This is the whole thing.
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:00.240]   This is a no agenda topic we talk about all the time.
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:02.240]   This is a screw job.
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:03.480]   Post office-- no, seriously.
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:06.720]   The post office was set up to make them pay 10 years
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:10.120]   in advance of all the retirement benefits, breaking
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.600]   the bank, and making a look as though the post office is
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.280]   going in the business when it is not making serious money.
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:15.680]   Is it?
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:18.800]   This is all part of a scheme to get rid of the post office,
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.200]   which is in the Constitution, to make federal express
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:23.160]   and UPS take over the whole business
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:25.640]   or we're paying a fortune to send a simple letter.
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:27.640]   This is a scam.
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:28.800]   You know what's not a scam?
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:29.800]   Stamps.com.
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:30.480]   That's right.
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:31.120]   Thank you, Bob.
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:32.240]   That's right.
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.560]   But it requires the post office to exist.
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:35.920]   It actually does.
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:36.840]   There you have it.
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:38.360]   Now this might confirm what you're saying,
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.880]   because the post office loves stamps.com,
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.880]   because you don't go into the post office.
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.120]   They give stamps.com customers discounts
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:47.440]   you can't get at the post office.
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.280]   This may confirm what you're saying.
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:51.800]   21% as much as 21% on Express mail,
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.280]   15% of priority mail.
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:58.120]   They-- oh, if you use stamps.com,
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:21:59.880]   so what you have a scale--
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:01.920]   they give you a USB scale, you put the letter on there,
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:02.840]   prints out the postage.
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.040]   If it's international, it'll fill out the forms.
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.960]   If it does all the forms you need for priority
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.280]   or Express or whatever.
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:11.920]   And then the mail carrier comes to you and takes it.
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:14.080]   You don't even have to bring it to the post office.
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.920]   Well, you can always do that.
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:16.640]   No, no.
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:17.120]   You can't.
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.520]   You can put a stamp or something and the post guy.
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:20.720]   I begged to differ.
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.160]   My post guy takes my mail.
[00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:23.920]   Not if it's over 13 ounces.
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.120]   You have to go to the post office.
[00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:25.960]   OK.
[00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:27.560]   It's because-- post 9/11.
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.120]   I know, because I was mailing media mail.
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:30.120]   I was mailing my books.
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:31.840]   But I'm not normally sending out one pound packages.
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.240]   Well, don't you mail your books ever?
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:33.760]   Oh, that's right.
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.080]   Your books are getting thinner.
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:37.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.800]   Mine were heavy.
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.720]   Anyway, no, seriously, 13--
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.400]   but not with stamps.com.
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:43.800]   The indicia on there.
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:44.280]   It's fine.
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.720]   The mail carrier will take it.
[00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:48.080]   You can even schedule free pickups now.
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:48.440]   OK.
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:48.720]   OK.
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:49.360]   That's it.
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.200]   That's what's great about stamps.com.
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.320]   But look at this.
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:56.800]   If you go to stamps.com, now there's an $80 trial offer.
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:58.680]   Do not click that button.
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:01.960]   Click the radio microphone on the upper right-hand corner.
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:06.800]   And enter the offer code TWIT, T-W-I-T.
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:09.200]   We're going to turn that $80 offer to $110 offer.
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:09.680]   What's the problem?
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:10.200]   What's going on?
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:11.160]   She's signaling about stuff.
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:11.680]   You lose your dog.
[00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:13.040]   No, no, it's on the--
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:13.560]   Never mind.
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:14.440]   Oh, she wants her cover girl.
[00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:14.960]   Thank you.
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.200]   Oh, that too.
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.160]   That wasn't so easy.
[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.440]   That's not a purse.
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.880]   You know what I have to say?
[00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:20.840]   Hand me my makeup, please.
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:21.840]   And I'll be glad to do that.
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:22.200]   Well, thank you.
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.680]   I just want to know if you're not such a role.
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:24.840]   No, that's a quote.
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:26.360]   I want to know more about postage.
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:28.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:29.600]   Tell me more.
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:30.600]   There you go.
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:31.560]   What I'll lead in.
[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:34.200]   This is the first time Stamps.Con has advertised on this show.
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.000]   Now you know why.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.760]   Well, they're going to end up loving it.
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:37.640]   Because she's getting--
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:39.400]   I want to know more about postage for her.
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:39.880]   We love it.
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:40.200]   We love it.
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.400]   And it's going five minutes so far.
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:42.840]   This is going viral.
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:43.960]   $110 offer.
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:44.680]   Now, wait a minute.
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:47.400]   Listen, $55 free postage.
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:47.960]   What?
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:48.560]   Yes.
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:49.480]   That's a good deal.
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:50.560]   I'm telling you.
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.240]   And you get the digital scale for free.
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.880]   And you get a $5 supply kit.
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:55.240]   And a four-week trial, all you do is
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:57.160]   you pay shipping and handling for the scale.
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:59.040]   That is a very good offer.
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:00.520]   I want you to visit Stamps.com.
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.320]   Use the offer code TWIT.
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:05.240]   You got to get that extra special extra postage on that.

[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.120]   There's a picture of you on their website.
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:11.800]   Wait a minute.
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:13.920]   Only when you enter in TWIT.
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.160]   You look mighty sassy too.
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:16.200]   Yeah, that's a sassy.
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:16.960]   That's an old picture.
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:18.360]   I was sassy back then.
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:21.160]   That's before I learned about the ways of the world.
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.320]   Stamps.com.
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:24.240]   Use the offer code TWIT.
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:26.400]   Thank you very much.
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.440]   I was-- I think it was from the screen savers.
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:29.720]   That picture is an old picture.
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.800]   My hair is a lot whiter now than it was,
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:33.400]   mostly because of John.
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.640]   Basically turned my hair white.
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:35.400]   Good.
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:38.280]   Apparently, Twitter tried to buy Instagram.
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:39.240]   Did you hear that?
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:40.160]   That's from the next web.
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.240]   Did you believe that?
[00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:41.880]   You don't believe it?
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:42.440]   Girl.
[00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:43.240]   No.
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.480]   Girl.
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:45.000]   Lie.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:45.680]   I don't believe it.
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:46.160]   Lie.
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:49.920]   According to sources familiar with the deal, Jack Dorsey--
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:51.680]   Twitter doesn't make nearly enough money.
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:52.640]   They don't have the money.
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:53.720]   They don't have the revenue.
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:55.240]   They don't have the need.
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:57.360]   They just bought another-- I need to look this up,
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:58.640]   because I sound like I'm talking out of school.
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:03.200]   But they really did just buy another picture sharing service.
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:03.640]   You know.
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:05.920]   Well, I could tell you it's not as well known as Instagram,
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:08.840]   because nobody can remember its name.
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:11.360]   Dorsey was an investor in Instagram.
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:11.920]   Get this.
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:14.840]   In February, Jack Dorsey, the CEO of the founder of Twitter,
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:16.840]   no longer CEO.
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:19.520]   He joined Chris Sockop, Baseline Ventures and Benchmark
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:22.920]   Capital, in a $7 million series A round, which is probably
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:27.320]   worth-- I'm guessing $70 million or more.
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:28.800]   10x.
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:30.120]   He's fine.
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:31.040]   He's buying.
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:32.720]   The value is all seem so arbitrary.
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:35.360]   It's kind of-- when you get numbers like $1 billion.
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:36.960]   It doesn't make any-- it's like it's--
[00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:37.280]   I have to--
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:38.080]   Guys make all this money.
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:40.200]   Then they try to screw the shareholders
[00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.520]   with what this Google deals all about.
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:43.840]   It's unbelievable to me.
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:45.760]   Why are you buying a share in a stock when you don't even--
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.520]   what are you just kind of loaning in the money?
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:51.160]   Or is this like a kind of an affirmation
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:52.080]   that they're a good company?
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:55.040]   So you buy their stock and you have no voting rights?
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:56.800]   You don't really have a piece of the company at all?
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:57.300]   All right.
[00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:57.800]   So what's the deal?
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:59.460]   So Google-- so tell me what's going on,
[00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:01.560]   because I've seen this story, but I don't understand it.
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.280]   And you seem to know about money.
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:04.800]   I don't know why he's enraged.
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:05.920]   It's not that bad, really.
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:07.520]   Have you ever seen him?
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:08.080]   Well--
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:09.080]   He's always like-- some people--
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:10.040]   No, I'm not always that.
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:12.160]   Only when there's an outrageous situation.
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:14.520]   A lot of people feel that this is evil.
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:15.880]   It's not what's like this happen all the time.
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:16.360]   Google--
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:16.920]   This is a stock--
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:20.920]   And they're changing the basic type of stock.
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:21.880]   It's non-voting now.
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:22.380]   Oh, yeah.
[00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:22.880]   Yeah.
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:24.720]   So you don't really have a piece of the company
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:25.480]   when you buy the stock.
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:25.680]   So what's the point?
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:28.400]   If you buy Class C, but Class A and B shares
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.720]   are still going to be publicly traded as well.
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:33.240]   According to the prestigious Washington Post,
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:35.440]   watchdogs are concerned.
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:36.680]   Watchdogs are always concerned.
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:38.720]   That's why they called them that.
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.320]   Someone's always going to be concerned.
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:41.640]   But honestly, I don't know.
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:47.080]   After looking at the way Google structured their very first stock
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:49.320]   when they went public, and the way
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:51.640]   Sergey and Larry and a bunch of early shareholders
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:53.000]   managed to hold on to a lot of people in the power--
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:53.920]   That's what they want to do.
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:54.920]   They want to keep their power.
[00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:57.640]   Because the class at the stock has 10 times as many votes
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:58.560]   as class B, correct?
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:26:59.800]   This is a zuck thing.
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:00.640]   This is a zuck thing.
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:01.160]   The same thing.
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:02.160]   The same thing.
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:03.400]   And oh, I swore.
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:05.480]   But don't you-- let me think about this, though.
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:07.120]   If I'm investing in Google, don't you
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:11.640]   want to make sure that the founders continue to have power?
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:12.920]   You know, that's what they said.
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:16.880]   And the investors call-- when they announced the stock split,
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:20.000]   Mr. Page said, when you are buying Google's stock,
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.280]   you are saying that you trust us.
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:23.160]   You're investing in them.
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:23.680]   Right.
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:26.560]   And so if you want to invest in them, you buy Class C.
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:29.800]   If you want to invest in Google as a controlling shareholder
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.600]   with votes, you buy Class A or--
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:33.440]   So you can buy Class A stocks, still.
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:35.080]   That's what the man said.
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.160]   Is it the same price?
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:36.840]   I doubt it.
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:37.960]   Well, unless you--
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:39.360]   When they do the stocks split, I do
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.640]   believe that it will be the same price,
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:44.720]   and it'll go from $650 a share to $325 a share
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:46.200]   for all kinds of Google stocks.
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:46.520]   All right.
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:47.400]   It could be lying.
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.600]   Why do--
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:51.000]   John, why do companies split their stock in the first place?
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   I mean, what's the advantage of this?
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.360]   Well, for one thing, it's easier to--
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:55.760]   you have more kind of flexibility
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:57.400]   when it's trading at a lower price
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:58.720]   to do all kinds of different things,
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.920]   and it also jacks the price up usually.
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:03.480]   Now, when you pull a stunt like this, necessarily,
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:05.120]   this stock went down on the announcement.
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:08.280]   So investors are going to-- if you have a share of Google--
[00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:09.200]   Yeah, number two.
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:11.080]   You will now have two shares of Google.
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:13.400]   Instead of it being valued at, say, $600,
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:14.920]   the two shares will be $300 each.
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:16.760]   Yes, but they tend to dratch it up
[00:28:16.760 --> 00:28:19.440]   because there's always a magnetic attraction
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:19.880]   to the old price.
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:21.360]   The market likes it when--
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:21.560]   Yeah.
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:23.880]   Well, the market likes it because people who can't afford
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:27.800]   to invest in stock at $650, they can sometimes afford
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:31.440]   to invest in stock at $325, and they know it's going to climb back
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:32.800]   up slowly over the next couple years.
[00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:35.280]   Well, and that's kind of John's saying it's--
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:37.680]   there's this kind of pull towards the old price.
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:38.360]   Yeah, always.
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:39.480]   And you always see that.
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:40.000]   They split--
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.160]   The youth's done this.
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:42.880]   You go to those-- you go in--
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.040]   a lot of people do this.
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:46.440]   You go in and look at some stock you'd own years ago,
[00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:48.320]   and you say, wow, how does this--
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:48.840]   Right.
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:50.320]   Why does this think $5?
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:50.520]   Right.
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:53.480]   And then you realize it's been 10 to 1,
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:55.080]   but you don't normally think that.
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:57.880]   You always think of the old price.
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:28:58.960]   It's a scam.
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:03.160]   So these-- by selling stock in previous years,
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.120]   Page and Bryn, the founders of Google,
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:08.120]   have actually lost votes to these new stockholders,
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:09.840]   so this new structure basically doesn't
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:11.000]   dilute them any further.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.880]   And they're set up so they don't get diluted,
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:15.040]   even when they give stock to employees now.
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:15.540]   Right.
[00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:16.880]   Normally, you start to dilute the company.
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:17.560]   I do that.
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:18.720]   If I were going to give you stock,
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:20.720]   I would not give you voting stock.
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:23.760]   I would give you a non-voting piece of paper.
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:24.200]   Yeah.
[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:25.520]   Useless.
[00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:26.040]   Thanks.
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:27.400]   Well, if you only care about money
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:29.040]   and you don't care about power,
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.600]   non-voting stock is fine.
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:32.480]   You just need to see the success of the stock.
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:32.680]   Right.
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:34.920]   Without having to say think about it.
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:36.920]   How many times have you signed a proxy ballot?
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:38.640]   I said, go ahead.
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:39.520]   Vote with the correct answer.
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:40.520]   I use that slide, I don't use the answer.
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:41.520]   Yeah, I don't even sign the ballot.
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:42.840]   I just let it slide.
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:47.520]   In some cases, does it non-voting stock grant higher returns?
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:48.520]   You'd think.
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:48.520]   Good idea.
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:49.520]   A little extra.
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:50.520]   Yeah, no.
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:51.520]   I've never seen it.
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:52.520]   Is it always the same?
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:53.520]   I've never seen it.
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:54.520]   Maybe it does happen.
[00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:58.360]   If they, you know, if sweetened the pie, they could do it by giving non-voting stock a big
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:00.560]   dividend and not giving voting stock any dividend.
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:02.480]   But the people that are voting are going to vote that in.
[00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:04.400]   They're going to vote the dividend to themselves.
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:05.400]   That's the problem.
[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:07.160]   Oh, he makes a good point.
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:08.160]   Wow.
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:09.160]   Yeah.
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:11.840]   And she makes a good bun.
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:14.400]   I probably should explain that this juncture that Jolie has a lot of--
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:15.400]   Don't explain.
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:16.880]   I like the way he said it the best thing.
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:17.880]   They're good.
[00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:19.880]   And you call them pad the flea.
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:20.880]   Pad the--
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:21.880]   Pad the--
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:22.880]   Super.
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:23.880]   Pad, oh flea.
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:24.880]   Pad, oh flea.
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:26.880]   With a little of cream cheese frosting, it's quite good.
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:27.880]   Cream cheese and cinnamon.
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:31.160]   I encourage you all to sample Jolie's buns, if you have the opportunity.
[00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:33.320]   I'm speaking, of course.
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:34.320]   Yeah.
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:35.320]   I'm sorry.
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:36.320]   I'm sorry.
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:37.320]   She gives you a glare.
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:38.320]   She has things.
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:39.320]   She has an evil eye.
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:40.320]   You have to be careful with her.
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:41.320]   I'm speaking, of course, with people in the studio.
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:42.320]   Muffins.
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:43.320]   There you go.
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:44.320]   You're going to get a muffin.
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:45.320]   You can't make anything do it.
[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:46.320]   You can.
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:49.080]   Yes, you can.
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:50.240]   Leo can, for sure.
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:53.680]   If Pope Benedict is watching him, you could watch the starting of the episode.
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:54.680]   He's not here.
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:55.680]   He's not here.
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:56.680]   Just the pope.
[00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:57.680]   We have a priest in the audience.
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:59.480]   Do you think the pope watches podcasts?
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:03.280]   Well, we have stalled the video conferencing system for Pope Benedict.
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:04.280]   So I know he's--
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:05.280]   I saw that.
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:06.280]   I saw that he was like skyping or something.
[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:07.280]   Well, he's on the guy.
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:08.280]   He's on the guy.
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:09.280]   He's on the guy.
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:10.280]   Someone's on the other side.
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:11.280]   Do you like Skype Cardinals and other--
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:12.280]   Skype Cardinals.
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:13.280]   Yeah.
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:15.280]   You have to probably be a cardinal to get a Skype from the pope.
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:17.280]   It's hard to reach through the screen.
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:18.280]   No, bad.
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:19.280]   Bad.
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:20.280]   Can you kiss his ring?
[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:21.280]   Can he put his--
[00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:23.280]   No, you get off the track here.
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:24.280]   You can kiss his ring.
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:25.280]   What is the protocol?
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:28.240]   I mean, because normally if you meet him in person, you would kiss his ring.
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:31.040]   If you ever met him in person, there would be three people standing next to you telling
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:32.040]   you exactly what to do.
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:33.040]   Right.
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:34.040]   Right.
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:35.040]   Right.
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:36.040]   Same thing with a queen.
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:37.040]   Same thing, right?
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:38.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:39.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:40.040]   But Skype changes that.
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:41.040]   You don't-- I think you kissed the keyboard.
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:42.920]   I think you're joking now.
[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:43.920]   I think the father is--
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:44.920]   Leo does that anyway.
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:48.680]   No, only when I'm drunk and my nose just lands on the GQ.
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:50.880]   So let's get Trey in the conversation.
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:51.880]   He's bored stiffer.
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:55.320]   Actually, I really like what you said about the idea that we're going visual.
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:56.320]   Yes.
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:59.960]   And that the value of Instagram may really be that people are speaking in pictures more.
[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:01.640]   Does that not change everything?
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:03.480]   I mean, is it because of TV?
[00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:07.560]   Is it because-- why would we move from the written word to images?
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:13.560]   Oh, it's because we're moving from a world of web pages to a world of streams.
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:19.480]   Because early adopters, now this is going to the mass market, really, your daily life
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:22.640]   is filled with what is new.
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:25.920]   You don't go-- it takes a lot of effort actually to type in a website and go over there.
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:30.520]   It's very simple to hang out on Instagram or watch the pictures as they float by.
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:31.520]   Yeah.
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:32.960]   And you just see this stuff come at you.
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:36.000]   And we are-- we're visual creatures, right?
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.680]   We understand environments.
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:42.080]   We walk around a 3D world and understand horizons and people and objects.
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:43.520]   And they say, this is how we're built.
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:45.440]   It makes natural sense to our brain.
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.120]   We love seeing new things.
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:50.600]   From an evolutionary view point, letters and writing are very new.
[00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:53.000]   In fact, we're meant to walk around as humans.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   And we don't.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   Right.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   We just sit here.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.920]   But seeing pictures come after you give you the illusion of walking around.
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:00.600]   You know, I won't back it up.
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:01.600]   I won't back it up.
[00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:05.960]   I won't back it up because when we've been doing audio podcasts forever, and really,
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:10.880]   most of our audience still downloads audio, but I felt intense pressure to do video.
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:14.360]   People don't pay attention if you're not doing video.
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:16.160]   I mean, still people get the audio.
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:20.800]   But I think from the-- and there are a few of our shows that are higher videos, downloads.
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:21.800]   Like what?
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:23.920]   iPad a day, which is more visual.
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:26.080]   There's a couple of three.
[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:27.480]   I can't remember what the other ones are.
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:31.360]   But they tend to be the more visual shows where you want to look at it before you buy,
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:34.000]   I think, is mostly your video.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.280]   Even though the truth is, we don't have the time to watch video.
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:41.160]   I mean, that really is much more time consuming than listening in the car.
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:42.160]   Yeah.
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:44.680]   So I actually worry a little bit.
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:48.360]   But on the other hand, people don't take you seriously if you're audio only.
[00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:50.040]   You have to have that video element.
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:53.880]   Well, whatever your passion is, chances are that your passion, whether it's knitting
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:56.560]   or, you know, you want to see it.
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:59.440]   You want to see it rather than hear about it.
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:02.320]   Well, there are some kinds of intelligence, like mine in particular.
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:04.760]   I cannot absorb information from audio.
[00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:06.040]   I can't listen to podcasts.
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:07.040]   I have to see the--
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:08.040]   Well, you're a video--
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:09.040]   You're a visual learner.
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:10.040]   I must be.
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:11.040]   Yeah.
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.040]   I learn by reading.
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:13.040]   So I can-- I listen.
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:14.040]   I can learn by listening.
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:17.560]   Some people have to learn by seeing or some people have to learn by touching, by doing.
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:21.840]   And so maybe there's just more people out there who are visual learners and they dig
[00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:23.400]   photos more than they dig text.
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:26.680]   Well, not just photos, but also videos.
[00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:30.600]   There's this point, right, when you go to a party, a collection of people, there's a
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:31.600]   point at a party where everyone--
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:32.600]   Oh, everyone who waits--
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:34.600]   You won't be doing that anymore in New Zealand, I mean, for sure you.
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:35.600]   Oh, come on.
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:36.600]   They party on the island.
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:38.600]   They party down on the island.
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:40.600]   Party down on the island?
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:42.600]   There's lots of sheep.
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:43.600]   I've been learning to say--
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:45.600]   I'm just helping to get this--
[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:48.600]   Go ahead, Audrey's trying to-- come on, get us back.
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:49.600]   Sorry, I got you.
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:55.000]   The more senses that you can engage, the easier it is for people to learn materials.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.920]   So reading is one way.
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:58.000]   Listening is another one.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.880]   If you found out a way to do smell, smell is actually an incredibly powerful sense.
[00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:06.560]   But when we start talking about different ways of communicating, they are really--
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.360]   really kind of cyclical.
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:12.160]   You get one that people haven't seen for a while, so they'll be really excited about,
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:14.800]   and then it will start to wane, and it will go back to something else.
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:15.880]   Because we like the new.
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:17.040]   We do like the new.
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:18.040]   We do like the new.
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:22.360]   And right now, there's a little wrinkle on still photography that has created a big
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:24.200]   boom again.
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:25.560]   And then it will switch over to visual.
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:28.200]   And I'm hoping it switches back to audio.
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:29.200]   I don't like that.
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.200]   I kind of like it.
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:31.200]   You're hoping why?
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:33.520]   Well, because there is something different about listening.
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:34.520]   Surmons.
[00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:35.520]   Surmons.
[00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.840]   Well, yes, too.
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:43.360]   When I was teaching, I would always have my students listen to a broadcast and watch
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:44.360]   a broadcast.
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:45.520]   I'd split the class down the middle.
[00:35:45.520 --> 00:35:48.040]   And it was amazing the differences that they would get.
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:49.040]   Absolutely.
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:50.040]   Absolutely.
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:51.040]   How interesting.
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.040]   Yeah, that makes nothing more interesting.
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:53.360]   Did you make that as an experiment, or did you then flip them and have them do it the
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:54.480]   other way as well?
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:55.560]   I would always flip.
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:57.360]   It was a way of teaching.
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:58.360]   Right.
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:04.400]   And the perfect example of that is the first real use of television in a presidential debate
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:06.960]   between Kennedy and Nixon.
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:09.920]   The people who listened to it only class in Nixon won.
[00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:12.440]   People who watched it knew Kennedy won.
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:13.440]   Right.
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:16.520]   Because of how Nixon looked, because he was sweaty at a five o'clock chat.
[00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:19.600]   All the nonverbal stuff was getting across stronger.
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:25.880]   But that would argue for Trey's point of view because they got in a sense they got more.
[00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:29.520]   They heard Anne saw and there was more information in the visual, right?
[00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:30.520]   Right.
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:31.520]   More misinformation in the film.
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:32.520]   Yeah, I think she might be right there.
[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:34.080]   I can't believe everything you see.
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:36.800]   But I don't want to say that you lie in the eyes with a five o'clock shadow.
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:37.960]   I mean, that's what people were saying.
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:38.960]   Yeah, you do.
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:41.000]   You want the sweaty, hard-working, five o'clock shadow president.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.600]   Well, but that's what people were saying.
[00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:44.800]   And so that additional information helped them.
[00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:47.880]   And even if that was a mistake, it helped them make the decision.
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:51.240]   Kennedy had people on his staff who had experimented with TV before.
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:52.800]   And so they knew about lighting.
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:54.040]   They knew about camera angles.
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:56.080]   Well, they also had a cute candidate.
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:57.240]   And frankly, that's a lot of it.
[00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:58.240]   Right.
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:01.320]   If you have a cute candidate, yeah, Nixon looked like a sleazeball.
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:02.320]   Right.
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:03.920]   But audio only is going away.
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:05.920]   Not going away, but it's maybe flatlining.
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:09.800]   Because the reason that we had audio only was mainly a bandwidth concern.
[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:14.040]   And now it's so easy to have you look at YouTube video increases, right?
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:17.440]   These are just going up dramatically month after month after month.
[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:19.280]   Okay, I'll argue with you on that.
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:22.120]   Because I think that those numbers on YouTube are starts.
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:24.280]   They don't measure how much of the videos watched.
[00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:25.440]   I think there are a lot of starts.
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:27.560]   I think there's a lot of repeat starts.
[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:31.440]   I think the evidence is pretty clear that those numbers are highly inflated on YouTube.
[00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:33.680]   So I wouldn't say judge it by that.
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:37.000]   And I got to tell you, most people don't have time to sit down and watch.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.360]   They have a lot more time to listen to the car.
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:42.160]   Well, do they have stats as to actual minutes viewed?
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:43.920]   They don't relief the release.
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:45.720]   A lot of videos are short anyway.
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:47.200]   Yeah, because the Coney thing would be busted.
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:48.840]   Good reason, exactly.
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:49.840]   Yeah.
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:50.840]   Coney.
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:56.080]   There was a Stanford study not too long ago that talked about brainwaves while listening
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:58.800]   and watching a particular content.
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:02.440]   And what they found is that when you have someone who has a really good radio voice,
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:04.920]   and I'm not going to point to anyone at the table right there.
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:06.120]   That man is sitting in the middle.
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:08.680]   But listening to actually Jolie's got a great radio.
[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:10.280]   Yes, she has a wonderful voice.
[00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:15.280]   But the brain tends to synchronize a bit more with a voice heard, a melodic voice.
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:16.280]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:17.280]   And it's not necessarily what they're saying.
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.600]   It's how they're saying it.
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:21.920]   You don't get that same sort of synchronization when people are watching something.
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:23.240]   It's a different part of the brain that's engaged.
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:25.040]   You have to look like Magnum PI or something.
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:27.480]   Is there like a look that does the same thing?
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:29.240]   The funny thing is it's not necessarily beautiful.
[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:30.240]   You have to look different.
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:31.240]   Interesting.
[00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:32.240]   Yeah.
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:36.480]   That's why a lot of movie stars are kind of have like big heads or big noses or some
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:39.720]   sort of quirk that grabs your eye.
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:40.720]   Interesting.
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:41.720]   Wow.
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:45.720]   When we come back, let's talk about the Apple lawsuit.
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:50.920]   The DOJ is investigating and has filed a lawsuit against Apple over price fixing and
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:52.560]   eBooks.
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:53.920]   We thought there'd be a settlement right away.
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:55.560]   You wrote an article talking about this, Jolie.
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:56.560]   I would love to get you.
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:57.560]   Well, analysts thought there would be a settlement.
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:59.880]   Yeah, we thought last week we were talking about this, we said they're supposed to settle
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:01.720]   and Monday, nothing happened.
[00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:04.040]   So what is the story we'll talk about in just a bit?
[00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:05.280]   Great panel here.
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:08.840]   And nothing more to say about that.
[00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:09.840]   You're just great.
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:10.840]   You're all of you.
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:11.840]   Great.
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:12.840]   Wonderful people.
[00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:13.840]   You work in the voice again.
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:15.440]   I say, you're getting sleepy.
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:17.200]   The chat room is getting out sleepy.
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:19.200]   Don't let them do that.
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:20.760]   I don't want people to fall asleep.
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:21.760]   You're getting awake.
[00:39:21.760 --> 00:39:23.480]   Look, there goes Jolie.
[00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:24.720]   She's running away.
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:26.720]   Quick, catch her.
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:29.320]   This.
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:33.960]   So what you're saying is like I'm the Marilyn Monroe of radio.
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:35.960]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:38.920]   There's a guy at K&EW that sounds like me.
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:39.920]   Just like me.
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:40.920]   And isn't he soothing and zaparific?
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:43.560]   Oh, actually a lot of people call him.
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:45.200]   You have to say my kids go to sleep.
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:48.000]   So you have the laugh and the voice, which is the big money.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.320]   Jolie, that's the big money.
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:50.800]   I'm the happy man.
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:53.080]   And that's where the bikes come from.
[00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:54.080]   I can't do it.
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:55.080]   Actually miserable.
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:56.080]   That's why you're really--
[00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:57.080]   No, you have the cranky sound in your voice.
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:58.440]   Yeah, but there's no money in that.
[00:39:58.440 --> 00:39:59.440]   No, I agree.
[00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:01.680]   That's why they like us together.
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:02.680]   It's like salt and pepper.
[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:03.680]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:04.680]   A little bit.
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:05.680]   Push it.
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:06.680]   A little bit.
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:07.680]   Real good.
[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:08.680]   This show brought to you by the good folks.
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:11.400]   It's Citrix, makers of Go to My PC.
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:12.880]   You are getting sleepy.
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:15.320]   And that's why you're going to visit Go to My PC.
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:16.640]   I've never tried this.
[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:19.960]   I could just forget selling features and benefits.
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:21.840]   Just go to the website.
[00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:23.880]   Go to MyPC.com.

[00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:32.720]   Thank you and good night.
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:34.560]   No, you feel refreshed.
[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:37.320]   You wake up thinking life is much better.
[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:38.320]   I should just try that.
[00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:42.040]   But all this time I've been talking about how great Go to My PC is and it lets you access
[00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:47.120]   your computer anywhere you go from another computer you log in and you can run any program,

[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:53.400]   Look, she's getting her email via Go to My PC.
[00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:55.200]   You can do it from an iPad.
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:57.640]   It's amazing.
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:58.640]   And it's great.
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:00.120]   And it's fast and effective.
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:01.480]   It's secure under 28.
[00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:03.080]   I say things like under 28.
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:04.080]   SSL.
[00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:05.080]   That just puts people to sleep.
[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:08.240]   I should just say visit go to MyPC.com.
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:11.520]   Click the orange, try it free button.
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:14.480]   Use the offer code TWIT.

[00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:21.120]   You feel refreshed.
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:22.840]   You're losing weight.
[00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:24.360]   My you're good looking.
[00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:27.600]   Have you been working out lately?
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:30.320]   People do like you.
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:33.040]   What am I thinking?
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:34.040]   I should have done that.
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:35.440]   It's like this all along.
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:38.400]   We like to sell features and benefits because we know you're a smart group.
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:39.800]   Go to MyPC.com.
[00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:43.040]   Click the try it free button offer code TWIT.
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:47.440]   It's amazing because Robert, Jolie and John have fallen asleep in there under the table
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:48.440]   now.
[00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:49.600]   They're relaxed.
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:50.600]   They're refreshed.
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:53.120]   When they wake up, they're going to feel much better.
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:55.040]   I don't like John being down there.
[00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:57.760]   I'm afraid he'll steal my shoes.
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:58.760]   I don't know.
[00:41:58.760 --> 00:41:59.760]   I just have that feeling.
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:00.760]   How's everything going?
[00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:03.360]   You got the Sony any X with you?
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:04.360]   Yeah.
[00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:06.240]   This is a whole new class.
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:10.920]   In fact, you wrote the article on your site stuck in custom.com, Tre Wreckliffe, saying
[00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:16.000]   that perhaps mirrorless cameras like this would be replacing those big heavy DSLRs we've
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   all been using.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   I don't say perhaps.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:23.040]   I say it's an inevitable future that DSLRs for most people will go away.
[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:24.040]   They're too big.
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:28.240]   The reason that DSLRs are so big is not because they're awesome.
[00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:31.920]   It's because they have to have room for that old DaVinci-like mechanical mirror to flip
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:34.760]   up and down, which is, if you think about it, it's 2012.
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:36.720]   I'll tell you what we have that moves physically.
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:39.800]   I'll tell you my argument against these mirrorless cameras.
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:43.240]   The thing I like about DSLRs, the thing the mirror allows is that when I look through
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:47.360]   the viewfinder and I'm looking through the lens, the mirror allows me to do that.
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:49.240]   On these, you have to use what's called a video tap.
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:51.240]   You're actually looking at a video of what you're looking at.
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:53.240]   Aha, but here's where you're wrong.
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:54.240]   I don't have to look--
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:56.240]   I know your eye up to this thing, right?
[00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:57.240]   Yeah, the viewfinder.
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:01.560]   If you get a full blackout, it is an electronic view, but you get this HUD overlay.
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:02.720]   It's like Luke Skywalker's binoculars.
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:06.640]   Yeah, but I'm not seeing the-- is a disconnection from what I'm looking at.
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:07.640]   I'm not seeing the image.
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:09.200]   I'm seeing a video of the image.
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:10.440]   It's a low-res video, right?
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:11.440]   It's not a very good-- let me look.
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:12.440]   No, it's incredibly high-res.
[00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:13.440]   Oh, it is.
[00:43:13.440 --> 00:43:14.440]   This is the NEX-7.
[00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:15.440]   They've gotten better.
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:16.440]   This is the best EVF ever made.
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:17.440]   Yeah, but it's just falling asleep.
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:19.080]   I just feel in the middle of my life.
[00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:22.080]   You know what you want is something with a Pelicle mirror.
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:23.080]   Remember those things?
[00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:24.800]   This feels like an OLED screen, actually.
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:25.800]   It looks pretty good.
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:27.520]   It's pretty amazing screen.
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:28.520]   It's super-class.
[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:31.520]   I think there is a camera, a digital camera, the Pelicle mirror.
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:32.520]   What's a Pelicle?
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:34.800]   They used to be-- it can't in-event at this year's ago.
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:36.200]   They used to have it on their old SLRs.
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:39.120]   It was called the Pelicle-- the Pelis-- something or other.
[00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:43.840]   It's a lens that has a bunch of prisms in the mirror.
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:46.520]   The mirror will-- it actually sends out two images.
[00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:49.080]   One to the viewfinder and one to the-- so essentially--
[00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:50.400]   It doesn't have to move the mirror.
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:51.400]   It doesn't have to move.
[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:52.400]   Palux has a point.
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:56.200]   He says, "Me not liking a video tap is like a-- the pilot's not
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:57.680]   liking the fly-by-wire airplane.
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:59.240]   So I want my hand on it.
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:00.800]   Yo, can I want the rudder to move?
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:02.720]   I don't have a problem with this.
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:03.400]   You don't mind it?
[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:04.000]   No.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.560]   This one looks much better, say, than the Olympus did.
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:07.720]   The Olympus doesn't have a view for you.
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:08.520]   Oh, actually, you're right.
[00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:09.240]   It wasn't the Olympus.
[00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:10.680]   It was a Fuji that I had.
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:12.240]   It was another micro four-thirds.
[00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:13.320]   Is this micro four-thirds?
[00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:14.160]   No.
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:15.200]   This is APSC.
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:16.800]   So it's a bigger sensor.
[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:18.960]   You have to use Sony lenses or is there a standard?
[00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:19.680]   It's Sony.
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:20.800]   You got to use Sony lenses, but there you go.
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:23.400]   They're going to have 14 lenses by the end of the year.
[00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:23.920]   Uh-huh.
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:25.680]   And all expensive overpriced.
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:26.200]   Yes.
[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:26.200]   And--
[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:28.360]   Should you see they're firing 10,000 people?
[00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:28.840]   Sony.
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:29.360]   Sony.
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:29.640]   They're structuring.
[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:31.480]   Sony is-- we should talk about Sony.
[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:33.120]   Let's talk about Sony.
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:35.240]   They're firing 10,000 people because they're pursuing
[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:38.760]   a new strategy, the one Sony strategy.
[00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:40.760]   This is like George Bush's--
[00:44:40.760 --> 00:44:43.920]   what would he call it, the New World Order, the one Sony?
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:46.400]   I had a good column in market watch
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:49.040]   about Sony and the library of the columns.
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:50.200]   And this one-- that thing's--
[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:51.240]   Did I just take 40--
[00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:51.740]   About four.
[00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:53.000]   You got to be careful with that thing.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:53.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:54.960]   That was a burst.
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:57.600]   I said that Sony should split the company up
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:00.920]   into three or four divisions and make them separate companies.
[00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:01.840]   Hey, do you mind--
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:02.520]   This is great.
[00:45:02.520 --> 00:45:03.440]   This is actually very useful.
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:04.200]   It's fun, isn't it?
[00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:04.520]   Yeah.
[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:05.360]   Yeah.
[00:45:05.360 --> 00:45:06.240]   Does he say something?
[00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:06.960]   How much is it?
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:08.880]   Hey, you know, it's like--
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:10.520]   Why don't you--
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:12.200]   Does Sony make this?
[00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:12.680]   Yeah.
[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:13.760]   I like that shot.
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:14.400]   That's a good shot.
[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:16.800]   Jon putting up his hand saying, no pictures.
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:18.520]   No pictures.
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:20.320]   And the image quality's good.
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:21.040]   Yes.
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:22.040]   All right.
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:24.000]   Jon has a column in market watch.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:24.840]   Yeah, it did.
[00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:27.440]   And it said that they should split the company up.
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:28.840]   Well, we've talked about this before.
[00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:31.200]   I think we talked about it last time we talked about Sony.
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:32.600]   This is what you always said about Microsoft.
[00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:34.000]   They should have different divisions.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.120]   So it should be a consumer division?
[00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:38.560]   I think there should be a professional division,
[00:45:38.560 --> 00:45:42.360]   which has the medical stuff and all the high end cameras,
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:45.040]   the stuff for pros, the broadcast equipment.
[00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:47.760]   Then they should have a game entertainment division, which
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:52.200]   would include the movie company and maybe the PS4 or whatever.
[00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:53.680]   And then they should have a consumer division.
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:55.600]   That would be a nice way to do it.
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:58.280]   10,000 people's, a lot of people.
[00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:00.080]   Is that worldwide?
[00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:01.280]   Apparently, you're not interested.
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:03.440]   And you've already separated out Sony Entertainment, right?
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:04.600]   That would be--
[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:06.000]   They should sell that division.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   Just get that division out of it.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.040]   That's what's ruined them.
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:09.000]   It's what's ruined them.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:09.880]   They went Hollywood.
[00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:11.600]   They couldn't do their MP3 player,
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:14.120]   because it would interfere with our record industry.
[00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:15.800]   If you want to be a consumer electronics company,
[00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:20.040]   you cannot have a vested interest in the content of Hollywood.
[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:21.960]   Otherwise, you get the mini-disc and A-track.
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:23.120]   Exactly.
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:24.200]   And the magic, what is that?
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:25.040]   Chewing gum memory.
[00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:25.960]   Right, the memory stick.
[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:27.280]   The memory stick.
[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:28.360]   That's what happened to Sony.
[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:29.480]   And mini-discs.
[00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:30.280]   You mentioned A-track.
[00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:30.640]   Yeah.
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:33.000]   Is there a different philosophy of just business
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:36.120]   between the Japanese big tech companies
[00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:37.640]   and the American big tech companies?
[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:40.240]   They don't seem to do things like American tech companies.
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:41.440]   Just because they're Japanese.
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:43.240]   Well.
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:45.400]   Sony did invent Blu-ray, but we've got to give Sony
[00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:46.400]   credit for Blu-ray, right?
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:48.400]   Well, Panasonic is the ones who really pushed it.
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:49.000]   Oh, really?
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:49.360]   Yeah.
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:50.400]   But Sony invented it.
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:52.200]   I don't think I think it was a joint venture
[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:53.200]   with about five companies.
[00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:53.800]   Maybe it was.
[00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:54.320]   All right.
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:55.480]   But I remember it was Sony--
[00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:57.440]   it's going to Comdex or maybe it was CES.
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:00.480]   But seeing-- they were talking about the blue laser,
[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:01.320]   the blue laser.
[00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:02.840]   They were very excited about that.
[00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:04.080]   And this was years ago.
[00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:05.680]   Yeah, well, anyway, back to this Japanese.
[00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:06.240]   Back to the Japanese.
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:08.080]   The Japanese like to have a broad range of products
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:09.160]   as opposed to focus.
[00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:13.160]   Like Apple is the epitome of a focused company.
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:13.880]   And the Japanese--
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:14.400]   And they're the biggest.
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:15.720]   The Japanese want Koretsu.
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:18.000]   They want these conglomerates.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:18.520]   Yeah.
[00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:19.840]   The Korean companies do the same thing.
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:21.480]   I mean, Samsung makes bulldozers.
[00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:22.000]   Right.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.560]   But one thing none of them do is none of them
[00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:24.400]   have an architecture.
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:24.920]   They do.
[00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:25.120]   I know.
[00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:29.000]   That is open for consumers or developers to make things.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:29.920]   And that's where we're on--
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:31.320]   And they don't like to.
[00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:31.720]   They don't like to.
[00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:32.880]   We're number one.
[00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:35.520]   Because people, they see everything as a parasite.
[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:35.920]   Right.
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:36.920]   Yeah.
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:37.280]   Yeah.
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:38.800]   It's enclosed and we're open.
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:39.400]   Yeah.
[00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:41.640]   Like it's hard to make games for the PS3.
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:43.440]   It's much easier to do it for the Xbox.
[00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:43.960]   Right.
[00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:46.240]   No Nikon, Canon, Sony.
[00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:49.600]   None of them have opened this up for developers.
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:50.520]   We compare that to--
[00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:53.520]   Well, I'm looking at the attacking versus PlayStation hacking.
[00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:55.680]   Sony came down like a hammer on people.
[00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:57.520]   Jingle hot for hacking the PlayStation.
[00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:00.640]   And then Microsoft came along strategically the next week
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:00.880]   or so.
[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:02.880]   And I was like, oh, we'd love it if we could have
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:03.600]   on our connect.
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:04.320]   That's a good point.
[00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:04.840]   Yeah.
[00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:05.720]   That's goofy.
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:07.200]   Yeah.
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:09.280]   So let's talk about Apple and the eBooks.
[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:12.600]   Because we tried to talk about this all week.
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:13.800]   And I'm so glad you're here, Jolie.
[00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:15.000]   Because I don't understand it.
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.600]   I actually, John too, because John's always
[00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:19.560]   been interested in this whole relationship of publishers,
[00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:21.480]   the agency model versus--
[00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:22.640]   No, it's all just a racket.
[00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:24.000]   So what is the agency model?
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:24.920]   It is a racket.
[00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:27.320]   Isn't that what this is all about?
[00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:28.120]   It's a racket.
[00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:28.600]   And--
[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:29.520]   In fact, that's what Apple says.
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:31.200]   Apple says we're doing you a favor.
[00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:33.200]   We're breaking Amazon's monopoly.
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:34.000]   This is ridiculous.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.320]   Yeah, but they should be doing us a fair by lowering
[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:37.160]   the prices and breaking the monopoly.
[00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:38.960]   It is anti-competitive to say you are not
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:41.640]   allowed to sell your product anywhere else for a lower price
[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:42.560]   than the one that I get.
[00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:43.520]   That's anti-competitive.
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:47.000]   That's a very definition of anti-competitive business
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:47.800]   behavior.
[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:50.320]   It's ridiculous to me that anyone thought they could get away
[00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:51.560]   with this.
[00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:55.040]   And it's ridiculous to me that they structured the iTunes
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:55.840]   bookstore in this way.
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:57.400]   OK, that side I understand.
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:01.520]   But it seems to me as a consumer,
[00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:04.520]   Amazon sets the price in a book and tells the publisher,
[00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:08.520]   it's going to be $9.99 or nothing, or we won't sell it.
[00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:09.920]   And that's it.
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:12.480]   Apple says you set the price--
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:15.520]   whatever price you want, we'll take 30%, you take 70%.
[00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:18.880]   That seems to me-- I'm sorry, but it seems more fair.
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:22.120]   Yeah, but it's unfair because it's price fixing.
[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:22.720]   And they're--
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:23.880]   No, the publisher said the price.
[00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:25.920]   They're using-- yeah, but then they're all--
[00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:28.880]   And Apple says that, OK, that's the price everywhere,
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:29.400]   not just for you.
[00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:33.280]   Apple says you cannot let Amazon sell it lower than we do.
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:34.320]   Does that make sense?
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:36.440]   If you're going to set the price, set it everywhere.
[00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:38.080]   Well, actually, that nobody's going to buy it.
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:39.000]   You shouldn't be able to sell it.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:41.120]   No, the Apple thing was not about Amazon at all.
[00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:44.120]   It was actually-- in other words, if I get the book,
[00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:47.680]   and the publisher says, we want to sell that $14.95,
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:49.040]   which is the typical price.
[00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:52.200]   And then one of the members of the consortium, which
[00:49:52.200 --> 00:49:55.880]   makes this an illegal scam, one of the members says, well,
[00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:57.400]   you know, we want to do it for $12.95.
[00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:59.120]   Then Apple says, we're doing $12.95.
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:00.760]   We're all doing $12.95.
[00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:02.000]   OK, well, I'm going to do $14.
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:02.520]   That's collusion.
[00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:03.520]   That's collusion.
[00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:04.000]   That's collusion.
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:04.800]   That's price fixing.
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:05.800]   I get that.
[00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:06.760]   And that's what they're doing.
[00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:08.000]   And that's what they said they were doing.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.560]   Apple just said, let's go to the agency model
[00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:13.000]   and didn't do that, though.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:14.920]   Amazon would just undercut them.
[00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:16.160]   Amazon's always going to undercut them.
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:18.240]   But no, here's the problem.
[00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:18.800]   That's because--
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:20.920]   Those books aren't so good for a writer or a publisher.
[00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:22.680]   No, those books are not going to Amazon.
[00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:23.720]   That's the point.
[00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:25.200]   The publishers say, look, OK, here's
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:25.440]   the deal here.
[00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:26.800]   You've got a little group of people.
[00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:28.080]   You guys get to sell the book.
[00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:29.640]   Amazon, you're out of this one.
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:31.320]   You can go sell the books from these other guys.
[00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:33.280]   Yeah, because Amazon wants to set the price.
[00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:34.000]   And $9.95.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:35.560]   You know, laterally, they want to say,
[00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:36.960]   this is what that book costs, regardless
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:38.360]   of what the publishers spent.
[00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:40.640]   Regardless of what it costs to make it.
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:43.240]   Because they're cutting Amazon out of the deal.
[00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:44.160]   No, but--
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:45.120]   No, wait, wait, wait.
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:47.040]   Let's start back up a mile.
[00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:48.560]   You tell me what is it that you're
[00:50:48.560 --> 00:50:52.480]   visualizing that makes this sound kosher.
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:54.680]   I mean, how are you seeing this?
[00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:55.560]   OK, so, OK.
[00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:58.760]   Apple says to the publisher, if I make a widget--
[00:50:58.760 --> 00:50:59.760]   OK, I'm going to be a publisher.
[00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:02.160]   And I want to sell the widget at a orchard supply hardware.
[00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:03.760]   Let's do it with widgets.
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:05.360]   Micro-econ right now.
[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:05.840]   Go for it.
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:06.160]   I know.
[00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:07.400]   You've been to college, and I haven't.
[00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:09.440]   But tell me if this is wrong.
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:11.800]   So I make a widget.
[00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:12.880]   I make this mug.
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:15.880]   And I'm going to sell it at a hardware store.
[00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:19.880]   I seems to me that if I could set the price and tell
[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:21.600]   the hardware store, it's $0.99.
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:23.560]   You get $0.30, $0.33.
[00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:24.440]   I get $0.66.
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:25.680]   You can't do that by the way.
[00:51:25.680 --> 00:51:26.280]   I know you can't.
[00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:28.320]   But let's say that seems fair.
[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:30.400]   Then the hardware store says, OK.
[00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:32.800]   But since you said $0.99, don't go across the street
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:35.320]   and sell it for $0.80, because nobody's going to buy it for me.
[00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:35.600]   I don't know.
[00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:36.520]   It's a weird analogy.
[00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:37.520]   It's a weird analogy.
[00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:38.760]   I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:39.760]   I don't know.
[00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:40.760]   I don't know.
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:41.800]   I'm trying to make sense.
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:43.680]   I don't think anybody understands this really.
[00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:45.680]   Leo Father explained to me, Robert.
[00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:47.960]   You had a group of people who were making these mugs.
[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:48.320]   Yes.
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:48.960]   Not just you.
[00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:49.440]   Not just me.
[00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:50.880]   And you met with all of them.
[00:51:50.880 --> 00:51:53.960]   And you said, we're going to do this as a single entity.
[00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:54.840]   But that's not Apple's fault.
[00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:55.840]   That's the publisher's fault.
[00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:57.160]   You see, the last dying gaps.
[00:51:57.160 --> 00:51:59.160]   The publishers are freaked out.
[00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:01.200]   If you go to New York and hang out with any of these guys
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:04.080]   who were in the business, they are all freaked out
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:06.000]   about Amazon, because they don't want Amazon
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.640]   to tell them how to do their business.
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:09.360]   Now, until we--
[00:52:09.360 --> 00:52:11.040]   And it screws them up, by the way, when it comes to--
[00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:13.280]   In your article in Venture Beat, you say that actually,
[00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:15.640]   there may be precedent that gives Apple the upper hand here.
[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:17.200]   Yeah, there may be.
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:19.200]   What is the precedent that would make it OK for Apple?
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:19.360]   Let's see.
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:19.720]   What's the precedent?
[00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:20.760]   You have to read your article.
[00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:21.480]   Yes, I do.
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:22.360]   Hey, welcome to the book.
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:22.960]   The DOJ has--
[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:24.520]   That's why I write it down, so I don't have to write it down.
[00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:26.040]   And this is actually what I was saying.
[00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:28.360]   The DOJ has a better case against the publishers,
[00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:29.320]   because they colluded.
[00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:31.040]   They're the ones who said, OK, we're going to get together
[00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:33.000]   in a room, and we're going to set a price for a book,
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:34.280]   then Apple.
[00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:38.160]   There's 1982 precedents, DOJ against IBM.
[00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:40.040]   I'm sure there are precedents on both sides,
[00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:41.960]   and I'm sure a lot of lovely lawyers
[00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:44.600]   are going to be working very hard on this case.
[00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:47.080]   A professor of law at the University of Hartford
[00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:49.120]   said, if the CEOs of the various publishers
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:51.000]   did, in fact, get together in hotel rooms
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:52.480]   to discuss prices, their song.
[00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:54.320]   Without question, I think all the precedents
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:57.360]   say that the publishers, the CEOs of the publishing companies,
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:00.240]   if they colluded, then they're going to get smacked for that.
[00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:01.760]   Well, in which case, Apple wins.
[00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:02.240]   However, where there's not--
[00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:03.520]   So what's wrong with what Apple's doing?
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:07.000]   There's not really a precedent for this kind of price
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.960]   fixing in digital goods, not at this scale,
[00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:11.320]   not with these kinds of people.
[00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:12.760]   So it's different because it's digital.
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:13.760]   So it's different because it's digital.
[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:14.120]   It's new territory.
[00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:14.640]   Yeah.
[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:17.040]   Well, because you don't have--
[00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:19.000]   you really can't set a cost that's
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.560]   different from a retail price, because there is no cost.
[00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:22.840]   It's a digital good.
[00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:25.760]   So it gets really weird and really hinky, in my opinion,
[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:27.280]   that when anybody tries to set--
[00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:27.800]   I don't think it does.
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:31.440]   Andy's first law is designed to protect us, the consumers.
[00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:34.560]   So in the best of all possible worlds,
[00:53:34.560 --> 00:53:36.680]   there's competition for price.
[00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:39.640]   The price will naturally go down because of the competition.
[00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:42.480]   The problem is there's only one person who publishes John's book.
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:43.120]   It's simple.
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:44.200]   So there's no competition.
[00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:45.240]   I'm going to buy it.
[00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:46.800]   It's called price fixing.
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:47.440]   OK.
[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:48.040]   I got it.
[00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:49.640]   It's illegal.
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:50.800]   And they were doing it.
[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:53.560]   And the thing is, yeah, they came up with this gimmick.
[00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:56.520]   We had to remember this gimmick, this agency thing, is a gimmick.
[00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:58.240]   It's like, whoa, we're just going to be-- we're not going
[00:53:58.240 --> 00:53:59.440]   to be really selling the product.
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:53:59.880]   It's like a gimmick.
[00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:02.480]   We're going to be the agents of the big book selling.
[00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:04.520]   That's how they do apps.
[00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:06.160]   An app maker sets the price.
[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:06.800]   What's wrong with that?
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:07.240]   And then Apple--
[00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:10.720]   The difference is that there's no publisher with apps.
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:13.000]   And actually, I think that all publishers
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.320]   are on a trajectory for their own death anyway.
[00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:16.800]   They're unnecessary middlemen.
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:17.880]   Why do we need a publisher?
[00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:20.360]   John should be setting his own price directly with Apple
[00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:21.440]   and with Amazon.
[00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:24.280]   Oh, but then you have to design his book and copy it.
[00:54:24.280 --> 00:54:26.360]   Well, you hired-- no, you hired somebody.
[00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:27.360]   You can freelance that.
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:30.400]   You can get out of pocket to as a writer who has published books
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:32.440]   and who's also worked at book publishers,
[00:54:32.440 --> 00:54:34.240]   there is a lot of machinery that goes on
[00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:35.240]   within a publishing company.
[00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:37.760]   And I think there'll be a float, even if all they do is ebooks.
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:39.120]   They will be a float because you need the machine.
[00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:39.880]   You cannot do it.
[00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:40.720]   I think you need the machine.
[00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:41.880]   You can do it yourself.
[00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:42.880]   Plus, you get 70%--
[00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:43.880]   Why?
[00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:44.880]   Because I'm amazing.
[00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:45.880]   But everybody can do it.
[00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:47.040]   Well, see, there's an interesting tech wrinkle here.
[00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:49.760]   And that is the law was--
[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:52.480]   antitrust law was never designed to defend
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:55.200]   against this particular type of price fixing.
[00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:58.840]   You've got publishers who have a material good, the books,
[00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:01.680]   and they don't want the ebooks to undercut it.
[00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:04.520]   Now, you've got this situation where the consumer can get
[00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:08.280]   the exact same thing from a good that costs virtually nothing
[00:55:08.280 --> 00:55:09.120]   to manufacture.
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:11.120]   And so the publishers are scrambling to find out
[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:13.200]   how do we keep this virtual thing from understanding--
[00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:15.280]   They have to change the business model.
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:18.880]   They do get the publishing industry's numbers,
[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:20.440]   where ebooks are doing so, so well,
[00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:23.160]   and they really do cost nothing to produce.
[00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:25.960]   I think the publishing industry's attitude is a little bit more
[00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:27.280]   like, OK, here's a money train.
[00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:28.120]   How can we get on it?
[00:55:28.120 --> 00:55:30.840]   It's a ripoff for the authors, because I understand.
[00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:32.720]   I make 15% off my paper book--
[00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:33.800]   Is it the publisher?
[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:35.520]   --the publisher is not taking 85%.
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:37.480]   The guy that delivers the truck, the book binding,
[00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:39.080]   they all make pennies, right?
[00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:40.960]   It's like the death of 1,000 cuts.
[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:44.160]   But with the e-book, my e-book costs just as much.
[00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:45.880]   And I only get 15% of that.
[00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:46.720]   That's not right.
[00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:47.720]   That's not right.
[00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:48.720]   That's not right.
[00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:50.360]   Look at your contract, man.
[00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:52.880]   Maybe we writers need to be more clever about
[00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:53.880]   negotiating contracts.
[00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:54.880]   So people should be able to--
[00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:55.880]   Well, I do just e-book now.
[00:55:55.880 --> 00:55:56.880]   People sign only dummy contracts.
[00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:57.880]   It's all the contract.
[00:55:57.880 --> 00:55:58.880]   We've talked about the dummy.
[00:55:58.880 --> 00:55:59.880]   You bring that out, yes.
[00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:00.880]   Wow.
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:01.880]   What is about--
[00:56:01.880 --> 00:56:03.880]   That's how he's bringing it up.
[00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:06.440]   Apple's statement, the Department of Justice's Accusations
[00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:10.160]   of Collusion Against Apple, simply not true.
[00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:11.800]   I wouldn't disagree with what they say here.
[00:56:11.800 --> 00:56:15.600]   The launch of the iBookstore in 2010 fostered innovation
[00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:19.280]   and competition, breaking Amazon's monopolistic grip
[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:20.880]   on the publishing industry.
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:23.080]   Since then, customers-- and this is the key.
[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:25.880]   It's got to benefit us-- have benefited from e-books that are
[00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:29.880]   more interactive and engaging, just as we have allowed developers
[00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:33.880]   to set prices on the app store, publishers set prices on the iBookstore.
[00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:34.880]   I don't understand what's wrong with that.
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:36.880]   I kind of want to call bull crap on that.
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:40.080]   I think innovation in e-book publishing was doing just fine before
[00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:41.880]   Apple got into doing an--
[00:56:41.880 --> 00:56:42.880]   Oh, but I know.
[00:56:42.880 --> 00:56:43.880]   But it's gotten better.
[00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:44.880]   It has.
[00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:45.880]   But that's more because of the hardware.
[00:56:45.880 --> 00:56:47.880]   I think it's gotten better because of the devices, the hardware, the
[00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:50.680]   interactivity that you have on a phone or any kind of tablet.
[00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:52.680]   Any kind of computer.
[00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:57.680]   That's why-- I mean, it wasn't Amazon controlling e-books.
[00:56:57.680 --> 00:57:01.680]   And developers having Apple to work with hasn't made everyone's life
[00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:02.680]   magically better.
[00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:05.680]   No one's getting an amazingly good deal because Apple got into the
[00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:09.680]   e-book game and broke the Amazon monopoly, which is the stupidest
[00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:10.680]   I'm using.
[00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:13.680]   I must be missing something because it just seems like this is how we do it
[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:14.680]   with apps.
[00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:17.680]   Hey, this is-- OK, let's get publishers out of the mix.
[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:18.680]   Well, no.
[00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:19.680]   That's the problem.
[00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:20.680]   You can't do that.
[00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:21.680]   They will get out of the mix.
[00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:22.680]   You keep trying.
[00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:25.680]   Every one of your analogies moves the publishers out of the discussion.
[00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:26.680]   Right.
[00:57:26.680 --> 00:57:27.680]   Well, that's where there's--
[00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:28.680]   Well, because there's a lot of real characters.
[00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:30.680]   They're the ones who are the bad actors.
[00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:32.680]   They are doing all this nasty stuff.
[00:57:32.680 --> 00:57:34.680]   So Apple's not, but the publishers are.
[00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:35.680]   Everybody is.
[00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:39.680]   Apple's just like the mean little kid who kind of talked them into this idea.
[00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:41.680]   But in the long run, they're just inter-mediating.
[00:57:41.680 --> 00:57:45.680]   They're going to allow people like Trey to say, "I'm going to set my
[00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:46.680]   price.
[00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:48.680]   I know I'm going to get 70% of this price.
[00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:49.680]   I'm going to get a fair price.
[00:57:49.680 --> 00:57:50.680]   I'm happy."
[00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:51.680]   Yep.
[00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:52.680]   That's the future of all publishers.
[00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:53.680]   What's wrong with this?
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:54.680]   It's directly from the author to the consumer.
[00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:56.680]   Why would I go through a publisher?
[00:57:56.680 --> 00:57:57.680]   So let's get rid of the publishers.
[00:57:57.680 --> 00:57:58.680]   Why?
[00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:01.680]   The only reason people go through it is to get in advance.
[00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:02.680]   So why sue Apple?
[00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:03.680]   Let's just get--
[00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:05.680]   Because Apple's quite a bit of a conspiracy.
[00:58:05.680 --> 00:58:06.680]   To do what?
[00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:09.680]   To defraud the public out of five bucks.
[00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:12.680]   This is the sofa and peepa of the publishing industry.
[00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:17.680]   This is an industry that's trying to protect a business model that must fail.
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:18.680]   Right.
[00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:19.680]   But is Apple helping that?
[00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:21.680]   No, Apple's really setting it up in the long run.
[00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:22.680]   Apple enabled it.
[00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:24.680]   Yeah, Apple's the guys that came in with the idea.
[00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:25.680]   Hey, I get a great idea.
[00:58:25.680 --> 00:58:31.680]   If you follow the money, Apple wins and publishers wins and consumers lose when this kind of thing
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:32.680]   happens.
[00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:34.680]   Until publishers go away, which you're going to.
[00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:38.680]   No, they're really not going to go into the record labels go away when MP3s came around.
[00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:39.680]   No, they're doing absolutely--
[00:58:39.680 --> 00:58:42.680]   Yeah, I think the publishers will not go away, but they do have to adjust their business model.
[00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:43.680]   They are adjusting.
[00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:47.600]   Usually they adjust by trying to screw the consumer, which is what we're seeing here.
[00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:48.600]   And that you're defending for some--
[00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:49.600]   I don't feel--
[00:58:49.600 --> 00:58:50.600]   Unkrew.
[00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:52.600]   Well, that's because you got so much money, you don't care.
[00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:53.600]   You buy everything.
[00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:54.600]   Oh, no, no.
[00:58:54.600 --> 00:58:56.600]   I think-- I look at e-book prices.
[00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:57.600]   They're cheap.
[00:58:57.600 --> 00:58:58.600]   I buy stuff on the Kindle and it's seven bucks.
[00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:01.600]   It's eight bucks for a book that was $25 in the bookstore.
[00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:02.600]   How am I getting screwed?
[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:04.600]   They're because they want to cut that out of the picture.
[00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:06.600]   Because it costs them zero to make it.
[00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:07.600]   It costs them nothing.
[00:59:07.600 --> 00:59:08.600]   It costs them less money.
[00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:09.600]   No, they don't want--
[00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:10.600]   How am I getting screwed?
[00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:11.600]   It's eight dollars.
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:13.600]   Because they don't want you to pay eight bucks.
[00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:16.600]   They want you to pay 14 bucks for the same thing.
[00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:17.600]   That's how you're getting screwed.
[00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:18.600]   You're not getting--
[00:59:18.600 --> 00:59:19.600]   It's still cheaper than the 25 bucks.
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:22.600]   Oh, so you don't care if everything goes up twice as much money?
[00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:23.600]   How--
[00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:24.600]   So the price goes down.
[00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:25.600]   How is the customer getting screwed?
[00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:29.600]   The seven-book that you're getting buying right now for seven bucks goes to 14 bucks out of--
[00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:30.600]   because of this collusion.
[00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:33.600]   You're fine with that when you could have bought it at seven if you want.
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:35.600]   It won't go to 14 bucks because the publishers go away.
[00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:36.600]   Trey Rakcliffe sells to me direct.
[00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:38.600]   And he's only going to charge nine cents.
[00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:38.600]   Oh, no, I just--
[00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:40.600]   Now you're just blue sky in the whole argument.
[00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:41.600]   No, it doesn't count.
[00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:42.600]   It's the future.
[00:59:42.600 --> 00:59:44.600]   Okay, I'm done.
[00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:45.600]   I'm through.
[00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:46.600]   Let's take a break.
[00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:48.600]   I love this.
[00:59:48.600 --> 00:59:50.600]   It's a cage match.
[00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:54.600]   Coming up, we're going to talk about Big Fine for Google $25,000.
[00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:55.600]   Whoa.
[00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:57.600]   How are they going to pay that?
[00:59:57.600 --> 00:59:59.600]   One gasoline bill for one hundred.
[00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:01.600]   I'm going to have to go with $67.
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:03.600]   God, Larry's just--
[01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:05.600]   Talk about going to the poor house.
[01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:08.600]   But first, a word from Squarespace.
[01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:14.600]   Please now, if you will, open your browsers to squarespace.com.
[01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:16.600]   Give them all your money.
[01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:17.600]   Thank you.
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:18.600]   [laughter]
[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:21.600]   Actually, this one, it doesn't work.
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:27.600]   It doesn't work because if you go to squarespace.com, the very first thing I want you to do costs absolutely nothing.
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:30.600]   And that's to try squarespace free for two weeks.
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:31.600]   You don't need a credit card.
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:34.600]   You don't need our custom offer code or anything.
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:36.600]   You just click this green button.
[01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:37.600]   So you've got a website in mind.
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:40.600]   It could be a blog, but it could be any photography portfolio, anything.
[01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:43.600]   All you need, first name, last name, your email, your name for the site.
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:45.600]   And a password, that's it for two weeks.
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:48.600]   You get to use everything at Squarespace.
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:49.600]   It's the best hosting.
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:51.600]   Never goes down.
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:52.600]   It's the best software.
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:53.600]   Makes it easy to design.
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:55.600]   And they've really added something.
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:01:00.600]   They've got two new templates, 13 redesigns, 85 new style options.
[01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:09.600]   They've got iPhone, iPad and Android apps that are really fantastic for updating your blog or moderating comments or looking at stats.
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:10.600]   Did I say stats?
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:12.600]   What great stats they have.
[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:21.600]   You'll know everything about what visitors do when they visit your site so that you can encourage, you know, the right kind of content, the content that they're wanting.
[01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:23.600]   And by the way, this is cool too.
[01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:31.600]   You can edit your text in HTML, text style, markdown or plain text using their WYSIWYG editor.
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:35.600]   They've got a live view post editor shows you exactly what that post is going to look like.
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:39.600]   If you're doing CSS, they have a special CSS editor that colors the code and everything.
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:41.600]   You get your full site previously.
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:44.600]   There's never a surprise about what it's going to look like.
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:51.600]   300 Google fonts, which by the way adds a very nice touch to making a site very professional.
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:53.600]   Look at the examples at Squarespace.com.
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:55.600]   You'll see every Squarespace site is unique.
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:57.600]   It has a personality of its own.
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:01:58.600]   It looks just like Robert.
[01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:00.600]   It's an amazing thing.
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:01.600]   No.
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:03.600]   For some reason they took a picture of you.
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:04.600]   [laughter]
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:06.600]   Threw me a little bit, but I...
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:07.600]   [laughter]
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:08.600]   I'm insane.
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:09.600]   Let's go to Hawaii.
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:10.600]   What do you say?
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:11.600]   Sweet.
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:13.600]   Actually, this is Auckland.
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:14.600]   This is Manukau.
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:16.600]   This is in New Zealand.
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:17.600]   Auckland.
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:18.600]   Auckland, baby.
[01:02:18.600 --> 01:02:19.600]   Capital.
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:20.600]   All over the world.
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:21.600]   People are making crates.
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:22.600]   What is the capital?
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:23.600]   Land of the Hobbits.
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:24.600]   Land of the Hobbits.
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:25.600]   I'm willing to miss the capital, actually.
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:26.600]   You guys are the worst.
[01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:28.600]   You don't know anything, do you?
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:29.600]   You don't know anything.
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:31.600]   This is Dr. Wiles site.
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:34.600]   It's a Squarespace site because it never goes down, right?
[01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:35.600]   I mean, that's what's really cool about this.
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:36.600]   No, we slammed it the other day.
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:38.600]   We could slam these sites and never go down.
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:41.600]   Go at www.chandisho.com and pound it at nothing came up with it.
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:42.600]   This is my new exercise regimen.
[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:45.600]   I'm going to sit on a box and stick my feet in the air.
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:47.600]   They call it "pilates."
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:48.600]   [laughter]
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:50.600]   That's what I'm going to do.
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:51.600]   That's the Pilate?
[01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:52.600]   Nope.
[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:53.600]   How you say it?
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:54.600]   No, that's Italian.
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:56.600]   Anyway, squarespace.com.
[01:02:56.600 --> 01:03:01.600]   Now, after you look at all this, after you try it for two weeks, perhaps you're going to
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:02.600]   want to get a site.
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:04.600]   Now, this is when we come in.
[01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:09.960]   The new pricing is very simple, $8 a month when you buy a year, $16 a month for the unlimited
[01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:12.760]   when you buy a year, or you can get it by month to month.
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:16.200]   But I would suggest getting the year because we're going to get you 10% off whatever your
[01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:17.760]   first purchase is.
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:23.560]   10% off with the offer code "twit" and the number 4, "twit for" one word.
[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:29.600]   Offer code is "twit for" for 10% off either your first year, your first month, whatever.
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:36.600]   squarespace.com, the secret behind exceptional websites, perhaps even your.
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:37.600]   [applause]
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:38.600]   Thank you.
[01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:39.600]   Thank you very much.
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:41.600]   Thank you.
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:42.600]   TextStop.
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:44.600]   TheTextStop.net is your site, Robert.
[01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:45.600]   That's me.
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:46.600]   What is it?
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:52.600]   It started off as just a blog for a weary priest who liked technology.
[01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:55.120]   I think that's a good name.
[01:03:55.120 --> 01:03:56.600]   The blog for the weary priest.
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:57.600]   The weary priest.
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:59.960]   I do so much tech work.
[01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:05.600]   I wanted to create something that was apart from the religious stuff that I normally do.
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:06.840]   And that became the TextStop.
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:07.920]   How fun.
[01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:15.440]   So are you a priest like you have a congregation or do you, what do you do?
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:17.000]   What do you do?
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.240]   There are millions of people asking just that same thing.
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:20.480]   What the hell do you do, Robert?
[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:22.320]   Actually, they probably don't ask you like that.
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:23.320]   No.
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:24.320]   I'm actually a Jesuit priest.
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:25.320]   So I belong to a religious order.
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:28.640]   It's not the same as I say belonging to a diocese.
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:31.080]   My order does mostly education.
[01:04:31.080 --> 01:04:35.400]   So for example, in the United States, we've got 28 colleges and universities including
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:37.680]   George Towne, Boston College, Fordham, Santa Clara.
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:38.680]   A lot of educators.
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:39.680]   A lot of educators.
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:40.680]   Yeah.
[01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:42.280]   And then about 65 high schools.
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:45.120]   Right now I'm working at our national office in Washington, D.C.
[01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:49.080]   So we're sort of the guys who help coordinate between all the different organizations that
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:50.880]   we have.
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:55.040]   But before this, I was working as an associate pastor in Hawaii.
[01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:57.000]   That's where I live there with my chief.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000]   Got it.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.040]   And down in San Jose.
[01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:01.520]   So yeah, my order, we kind of do everything.
[01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:02.520]   We a little bit of...
[01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:04.320]   But you do some IT stuff too.
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:10.760]   Yeah, I work with an organization called United Business Media, which puts on several
[01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:11.840]   shows and conferences.
[01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:13.840]   One of them is called Interop, which is the one...
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:16.200]   Oh, I know Interop, yeah.
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:18.080]   And so I'm one of the lead engineers.
[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:19.600]   In fact, so is Brian.
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:20.600]   And that's where we are right now.
[01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:25.680]   We're down in Brisbane putting a network together, a super huge network that will be
[01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:29.160]   an enterprise class network supporting all the attendees to the show.
[01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:32.360]   We are going to build it, tear it down, put it in the trucks, bring it over to Vegas,
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:34.640]   rebuild it, and then tear it down again and bring it back.
[01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:38.800]   So you set up in San Jose, the Interop network ahead of time and then bring it to Vegas.
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:39.800]   Right.
[01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:40.800]   Wow.
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:41.800]   Right.
[01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:42.800]   Wow, that's amazing.
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:43.800]   It's a very expensive Lego set.
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:44.800]   And fun too.
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:45.800]   And fun.
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:46.800]   Well, so nice to have you, Robert.
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:47.800]   Thank you for being here.
[01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:50.800]   And it's at venturebeat.com.
[01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:51.800]   That's correct.
[01:05:51.800 --> 01:05:53.600]   I have to be careful because you moved.
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:54.600]   I did.
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:56.120]   Venturebeat.com and it's going well there.
[01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:57.120]   So well.
[01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:58.120]   Yeah.
[01:05:58.120 --> 01:05:59.120]   So has to have you.
[01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:00.120]   I'll have a year there this summer.
[01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:01.120]   It's been a year?
[01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:02.120]   Almost a year.
[01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:03.120]   Wow, went fast.
[01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:04.120]   That's great.
[01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:05.120]   Well, great to have you.
[01:06:05.120 --> 01:06:07.840]   Mr. Trey Radcliffe, Stuckincustoms.com's your website.
[01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:10.280]   That's not going anywhere even though you're going to New Zealand.
[01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:11.280]   Yes.
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:13.320]   It will stay there the daily, total volume.
[01:06:13.320 --> 01:06:15.920]   No, I get changed the name of Stuck in New Zealand.
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:16.920]   No.
[01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:20.280]   He's got his review-- actually, it'll be going up soon, right?
[01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:21.280]   Yeah.
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:22.280]   For the NEX7.
[01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:23.560]   It's in Coet, but there.
[01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:24.560]   Yeah.
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:26.520]   You were just in China.
[01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:27.520]   This is neat.
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:28.520]   And you do a daily photo.
[01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:32.520]   One of the things that Trey does that's really made him kind of a leader in social media
[01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:36.440]   for photographers is you started doing a picture a day on the blog.
[01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:37.960]   Then you started doing it on Facebook.
[01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:40.200]   Now you do it on Google+.
[01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:41.200]   And that's really special.
[01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:44.560]   This is the bird's nest in China where the Olympics were.
[01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:45.560]   What a beautiful shot.
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:47.240]   A little of the day everywhere.
[01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:48.240]   No.
[01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:49.640]   It's actually very complex.
[01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:51.480]   I put different things in different places.
[01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:52.840]   We have different streams.
[01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:55.200]   I try to interact as much as I can.
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:56.040]   People ask for help.
[01:06:56.040 --> 01:07:00.040]   I give it when I have time.
[01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:01.600]   I don't know how you find time.
[01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:04.240]   And you're going to keep doing Trey's variety hour, I hope.
[01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:05.240]   Yes.
[01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:11.080]   In fact, tomorrow night, it's every Monday night on your network at 7 PM Pacific.
[01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:14.600]   And tomorrow we're doing the Sony any X7.
[01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:16.560]   We're going to talk about that.
[01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:17.560]   Every week it's something different.
[01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:18.560]   It's usually art.
[01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:19.560]   It's photography.
[01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:24.120]   It's sometimes some science or something critical.
[01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:27.160]   We get a bunch of smart people and a Google Hangout.
[01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:29.640]   And we just see what happens.
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:30.840]   That's kind of the format.
[01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:31.840]   What do you think?
[01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:34.640]   You're a big Google+ user.
[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:36.800]   As was I, I guess I still am.
[01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:37.880]   I like Google+.
[01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:42.760]   But it seems like Facebook is really kind of more going on there.
[01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:43.920]   But what did you think of the redesign?
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:44.920]   Because that shocked me.
[01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:49.600]   I opened it up earlier this week and I went, I was on the air and I went literally gasped.
[01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:50.680]   It just looked so different.
[01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:51.680]   I like it.
[01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:55.400]   I like how every post is constrained inside of this card because there's a lot of stuff
[01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:56.400]   happening.
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:57.960]   See right there, I reshared your post.
[01:07:57.960 --> 01:08:01.920]   So it's all constrained and it feels nice and tight with comments underneath it and all
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:02.920]   the plus one.
[01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:03.920]   This is nice.
[01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:09.480]   I like this that you can see activity on the post is a separate box and then it replaces
[01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:10.480]   the comments.
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:11.480]   I kind of like that.
[01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:13.920]   What I don't like a lot of complain about is see all that white space?
[01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:15.680]   It's a very efficient use of white space.
[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:16.680]   That's ridiculous.
[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:19.120]   The eye needs rest and it's already so visually busy.
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:22.560]   They have all these rules everywhere, these little lines, these shaded boxes.
[01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:24.560]   You really need some white space, dude.
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:25.560]   Really?
[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:26.560]   I would think so, yes.
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:27.560]   It seems like a wisp.
[01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:31.000]   You actually, there's no more or less white space than before, but now it's just left justified.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:35.040]   But previously on the left, it kind of had your circles with a huge gap of white space
[01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:37.040]   underneath and it was kind of just centered.
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:40.720]   And this is really more of a control bar because you can drag it around.
[01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:46.400]   If you don't ever use Hangouts or something, you can drag it to the more box where things
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:47.400]   can hide.
[01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:49.520]   I usually just hide the games there.
[01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:51.320]   So yeah, there's some advantages to this.
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:56.280]   I'm not crazy about how much advertising for Google Plus is on Google Plus.
[01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:59.960]   If you don't use Hangouts, there seems a lot of space wasted there.
[01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:05.360]   But it's Google's to a mangle as they choose, I must say.
[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:08.080]   Oh, and I keep screwing this up.
[01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:09.760]   I'm going to fix this change cover photo.
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:12.080]   They have two ways of doing the cover photo now.
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:13.680]   And I keep checking that box by accident.
[01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:16.560]   It looks like a Leo Newport impersonator.
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:20.920]   It doesn't look like Jack Lillane if he were Leo Newport.
[01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:23.240]   We should all be Leo for Halloween this year.
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:25.240]   We need some Leo masks.
[01:09:25.240 --> 01:09:29.760]   There should be a Leo Halloween mask.
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:32.040]   I want to see you in one of those blue jumpsuits.
[01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:33.040]   Yes.
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:34.040]   Yeah.
[01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:36.720]   All right, everybody, let's go.
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:39.200]   Moving right along.
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:40.800]   I forgot to plug you.
[01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:43.040]   John C. de Vorac looking sharp, by the way.
[01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:44.600]   I like it that you were at a jacket.
[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:47.400]   Somebody was saying, is he going to wear the stripey yellow shirt again?
[01:09:47.400 --> 01:09:50.440]   People, you know, that yellow shirt goes back to the tech TV.
[01:09:50.440 --> 01:09:51.440]   I know.
[01:09:51.440 --> 01:09:52.440]   It's a Kingston tree.
[01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:54.440]   It's a fuller, used to moan about it.
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:55.440]   It's so wily.
[01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:56.440]   It's so wily.
[01:09:56.440 --> 01:09:57.440]   It's why you wore it.
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:09:58.440]   Yeah.
[01:09:58.440 --> 01:09:59.440]   Love it.
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:00.440]   You look like you should be a beach boy.
[01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:02.440]   I look like you should be selling my screen.
[01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:04.440]   Yeah, something.
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:05.440]   Yeah.
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:10.520]   Google earnings, as long as we're talking about Google, were announced.
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:11.520]   Or are they going to be announced?
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:12.520]   They were announced.
[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:13.520]   They were announced.
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:14.520]   And how did they do?
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:15.520]   They did fine.
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:19.480]   Ten billion dollars and a quarter makes the Instagram acquisition look like something that
[01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:21.160]   happened in a baby sandbox.
[01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:22.320]   Ten billion?
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:23.320]   Is that profit or revenue?
[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:25.320]   That's revenue, sir.
[01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:26.320]   Yeah.
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:27.320]   They turned to profit.
[01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:28.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:29.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:30.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:31.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:32.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:33.320]   They turned to, they made some money.

[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:35.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:36.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:37.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:38.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:39.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:40.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:41.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:42.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:43.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:44.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:45.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:52.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:55.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:56.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:57.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:10:57.320 --> 01:10:58.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:10:59.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:00.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:01.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:02.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:03.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:04.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:05.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:06.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:07.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:08.320]   They turned to, they made some money.

[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:28.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:29.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:30.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:31.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:32.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:33.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:34.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:35.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:36.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:37.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:38.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:39.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:40.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:11:40.320 --> 01:11:41.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:42.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:43.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:44.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:45.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:46.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:47.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:48.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:49.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:50.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:51.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:52.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:53.320]   They turned to, they made some money.
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:54.320]   Why even bother finding them?
[01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:57.320]   Yeah, I'm sorry I can find that much in his beard.
[01:11:57.320 --> 01:11:58.320]   [laughter]
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:11:59.320]   [laughter]
[01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:07.280]   Um, so, but I think that that actually is good news for Google because FCC agreed with pretty
[01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:08.280]   much what everybody's been saying.
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:10.280]   We've been saying as well, this is an accident.
[01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:11.280]   This isn't something they will.
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:14.280]   You know, what do they, what do they want to find out really, right?
[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:17.320]   If they don't make money from it, I don't think it's intentional.
[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:18.320]   [laughter]
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:19.320]   You're probably right.
[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:20.320]   Well, that's not a joke.
[01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:21.320]   I really think so.
[01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:26.800]   People, maps by the way, because I noticed when your Wi-Fi is on, it more accurately positions
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:27.800]   me.
[01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:32.560]   And I bet the Google self-driving cars actually might also, they use more than just GPS, don't
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:33.560]   they?
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:34.560]   Lidar they use.
[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:35.560]   Yeah.
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:36.560]   Huh.
[01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:39.640]   Maybe, yeah, maybe that, but yeah, I would, I would hope the self-driving car isn't using
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:42.120]   Wi-Fi access spots to tell you about it.
[01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:44.880]   Just as I would hope they would be doing a little more accurate.
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:45.880]   Yeah.
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:46.880]   Yeah.
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:50.720]   I'm thinking it's just probably not a, you know, I'm roughly, I'm somewhere within 50
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:51.720]   feet of this.
[01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:52.720]   All right.
[01:12:52.720 --> 01:12:54.440]   It would not be good on a car.
[01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:59.080]   The document that the FCC filed was filled with unflattering references to Google, things
[01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:05.320]   like Google only provided five documents to the FCC's broad request for information,
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:10.160]   no email correspondence, nor did it perform a comprehensive review of emails.
[01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:13.640]   It didn't identify individuals who might have authorized this.
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:20.440]   It redacted information, which the FCC said made this useless, didn't provide an affidavit
[01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:23.800]   signed by someone with personal knowledge of the information that was provided to the
[01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:25.120]   FCC.
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:29.000]   It took five attempts to get the affidavit it wanted, along with several back and forth.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.160]   This just sounds like the cranky government.
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:33.200]   Sounds like they didn't cooperate at all.
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:34.200]   I don't know though.
[01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:35.200]   I mean, no email correspondence.
[01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:38.840]   It sounds like they had the worst intern in the world working on the FCC issue.
[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:39.840]   That's exactly what they did.
[01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:40.840]   This is ridiculous.
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:41.840]   Hey, Joey, come here.
[01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:42.840]   Joey, you're a high school graduate.
[01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:43.840]   Right?
[01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:44.840]   Go ahead.
[01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:45.840]   Give me the information.
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:47.320]   It sounds like the FCC just trying to save face.
[01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:48.320]   They made it cranky.
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:49.320]   It's very crunchy.
[01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:50.320]   They had to do something.
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:52.600]   They could just let it fade off into the sunset.
[01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:53.600]   There you go.
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:56.440]   Do you think 250,000 covers the cost of the investigation?
[01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:57.440]   I don't think 25,000.
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:13:58.440]   25,000.
[01:13:58.440 --> 01:13:59.440]   I think 25.
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:00.440]   Yeah.
[01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:01.440]   Oh, never mind.
[01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:02.440]   I retract my question.
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:04.640]   It barely covers lunch for the commissioners.
[01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:08.040]   That's like the covered letters on all the notes that they had to send out.
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:09.040]   I think you're right.
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:10.040]   I think it's face-saving.
[01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:13.480]   We got a spankum somewhere.
[01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:18.040]   Nokia confirms this has just been snake-bick.
[01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:19.280]   Is this Lumina 900?
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:20.280]   Do you like that phone?
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:21.280]   I have the 800.
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:22.280]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:23.280]   The 800.
[01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:24.280]   It's the same thing.
[01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:25.280]   The 900 is a little bigger.
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:26.280]   It's 4.5.
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:27.280]   I don't like bigger.
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:28.280]   Like how you say that?
[01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:29.280]   I don't like bigger.
[01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:30.280]   That's what you say.
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:31.560]   I don't like bigger.
[01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:35.160]   I like the 900, but man, they've just been one problem after another.
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:39.200]   First of all, they released it on Easter Sunday, which I'm sure Robert offended you.
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:41.000]   No, I was in line.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.000]   You were the only one.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.000]   Nobody was in line.
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.560]   No, nobody was.
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:47.720]   Now there was a memory management issue with the phone software.
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:53.520]   So they had to confirm that, offer a fix, and give $100 credit to everybody, whether
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:55.320]   you had the problem or not.
[01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:57.320]   That's nice.
[01:14:57.320 --> 01:14:58.320]   That's got to hurt.
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:03.080]   If you purchased a Lumina before midnight, April 21st, you get your $100 back.
[01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:04.080]   Cool.
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:07.840]   But I mean, that's a good way to handle a PR.
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:08.840]   Absolutely.
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:09.840]   Because it's going to be overdue.
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:10.840]   It's way overdoing it.
[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:11.840]   It's way overdoing it.
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:12.840]   It's way overdoing it.
[01:15:12.840 --> 01:15:17.080]   But when you're trying to make a comeback like Nokia is, and like, you know, the Windows
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:22.440]   mobile phone platform is $100 per customer, isn't too bad.
[01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:23.440]   It really isn't.
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:25.560]   Yeah, you've got such small market share.
[01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:26.560]   Right.
[01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:27.560]   $100 only amounts to like a million.
[01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:28.560]   There's a handful of people.
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:29.560]   What's the matter?
[01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:31.240]   When you think of that phone, Leo?
[01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:32.240]   I love it.
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:33.240]   I think it's a really nice.
[01:15:33.240 --> 01:15:34.240]   I mean, I think that phone sucks.
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:36.240]   And let me tell you why.
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:41.720]   It's a zoom is the reason.
[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:42.720]   It's a zoom.
[01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:45.440]   Plug it onto my PC and then get a, hey, this is a U.
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:47.440]   Yeah, let me take your photo, take the photos off.
[01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:48.440]   Oh, yeah, it's a zoom.
[01:15:48.440 --> 01:15:49.440]   You can't do that.
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:53.640]   You got to go, you got to load the zoom software, which is non-trivial on some machines.
[01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:54.640]   I agree.
[01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:55.640]   You load the zoom.
[01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:56.640]   It doesn't work at all on a Mac.
[01:15:56.640 --> 01:16:01.920]   And you got to go on, you got to zoom through a bunch of crap to get a photo off the phone.
[01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:02.920]   That stinks.
[01:16:02.920 --> 01:16:03.920]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:05.120]   The Google Android plug it in.
[01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:06.760]   It becomes a USB device.
[01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:08.800]   Off comes both Apple and Android now.
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:10.360]   You don't even have to plug the machines in at all.
[01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:13.960]   But in both cases, when you take pictures, if you set it up this way, they Google uploads
[01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:18.000]   to Google+, and Apple uploads it to iPhone.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:22.840]   I think this is all part of Microsoft's brilliant marketing strategy because the zoom is the
[01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:25.240]   most annoying thing that you're going to find with this phone.
[01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:28.520]   And so when they release eight and that's all gone, they're getting rid of that interface.
[01:16:28.520 --> 01:16:30.520]   It'll be a straight plug into Metro.
[01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:32.880]   Everyone will suddenly say, well, this is the phone I want to play for.
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:33.880]   Interesting.
[01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:34.880]   Do you think this is actually going to happen?
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:38.080]   No, not even other words.
[01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:39.880]   But are you excited about Windows 8?
[01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:43.160]   Because I mean, I imagine with the enterprise focus, you do a lot of Microsoft stuff.
[01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:44.160]   I do.
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:45.800]   It's so consumer-y though.
[01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:48.880]   Yeah, you know, that's the biggest concern.
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:51.320]   How's business going to take to it?
[01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:54.920]   Business will stay with seven until eight is forced on them.
[01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:56.920]   That's always-- there's still businesses on that.
[01:16:56.920 --> 01:16:57.920]   They might skip it.
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:16:59.120]   It's possible because everyone, every other one's been skipped.
[01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:00.600]   It's like a Star Trek movie.
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:01.600]   Right.
[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:03.880]   So seven has been in, and this has been bad.
[01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:05.240]   And then the first one was okay.
[01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:07.480]   And you go right down the line, there's every other one is good.
[01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:08.680]   So it could be out.
[01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:09.680]   It could be the next Vista.
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:11.680]   The wrath of Balmer.
[01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:15.800]   That's more people with ads.
[01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:18.200]   I actually like it, but I'm a consumer, right?
[01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:19.200]   So--
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:23.040]   There's some elements of it that are so my little pony and like, you just want to get
[01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:25.520]   the big, touchy, flashy, full screen crap out of the way.
[01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:26.520]   Let me get to my computer.
[01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:27.520]   Right.
[01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:28.920]   When you're a get down and get to work with--
[01:17:28.920 --> 01:17:31.080]   I don't even like computers.
[01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:32.080]   I like 8.
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:33.080]   He doesn't have a phone if you do.
[01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:34.080]   I honestly like it.
[01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:35.080]   I gave her a phone.
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:36.080]   Okay.
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:37.080]   I gave her a phone.
[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:39.240]   I mean, I called my mother.
[01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:40.240]   It was nice.
[01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:44.120]   I had the Ting phone, so I gave it to her.
[01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:45.120]   The Ting?
[01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:46.120]   Yeah, it is Ting.com.
[01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:47.120]   They were an advertiser.
[01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:48.120]   But it's lovely.
[01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:52.400]   And she said, "I had to charge it, so I stopped using it."
[01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:54.200]   Well, yeah, it seemed like--
[01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:55.200]   Yeah, it's crazy.
[01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:57.200]   So you used it for 8 hours.
[01:17:57.200 --> 01:17:58.200]   Yeah.
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:02.720]   I used it a few times and I charged it a few times and I just didn't use it all that
[01:18:02.720 --> 01:18:03.720]   much.
[01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:04.720]   But I have it, I brought it back.
[01:18:04.720 --> 01:18:05.720]   Oh, that's fine.
[01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:06.720]   I just thought--
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:07.720]   Your fiance is going.
[01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:08.720]   Sorry, no.
[01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:12.720]   How do you reach Jolie if you need to reach her?
[01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:13.720]   Yells at me.
[01:18:13.720 --> 01:18:14.720]   Yells at me.
[01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:15.720]   I'm always around.
[01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:16.720]   I'm in the kitchen barefoot.
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:17.720]   Semaphyl.
[01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:18.720]   Like you do.
[01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:20.200]   It's nice to be able to text.
[01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:21.200]   I'm just saying.
[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:23.560]   No, you don't buy it.
[01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:26.640]   I like being off the grid, man.
[01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:30.000]   It's so-- this is why I love having Jolie on the show because she's really John C. de
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:31.000]   Vorac in a dress.
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:33.000]   Have you ever seen any difference?
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.000]   Wow.
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.400]   I did not need that image.
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:37.400]   I did.
[01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:38.400]   I did.
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:39.400]   Ooh.
[01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:40.400]   No.
[01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:46.880]   Here are our Intel specs for the next big Windows 8 tablet, Jolie Odell, writing an
[01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:47.880]   adventure, dude.
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:48.880]   Boom.
[01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:49.880]   Okay.
[01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:51.720]   It's going to have an atom processor.
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:52.720]   That's kind of impressive.
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:18:53.720]   Ooh, an atom.
[01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:55.280]   Clover Trail.
[01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:57.400]   Is this a better atom?
[01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:58.400]   I hope.
[01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:03.200]   They're having atom chips that are more powerful, that can do more, that have higher clock speeds
[01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:06.440]   and still maintain a very low power consumption.
[01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:10.800]   Now, will that give you the experience of what you've expected from your laptop?
[01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:11.800]   Probably not.
[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:12.800]   Not going to be snappy.
[01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:16.520]   Well, compare to the ARM tablets that everybody else is using.
[01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:17.520]   It's getting closer.
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:18.520]   It's not there yet.
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:20.200]   See, that's what you're competing against.
[01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:23.680]   I think if you're looking at a tablet, you're not, even though some of these have keyboards
[01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:24.960]   they're convertibles.
[01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:27.640]   I don't know if you're really competing against the desktop or the laptop.
[01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:32.560]   You're competing against iPad number one, and they're not as snappy.
[01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:33.560]   No.
[01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:34.560]   Well, it's got these things here.
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:38.520]   They're about hyper-threading in burst mode, which I think are ways of compensating for
[01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:41.920]   the fact that it's not as snappy by making it temporarily, very, very snappy.
[01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:42.920]   Temporarily snappy.
[01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:43.920]   It's like virtually snappy.
[01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:44.920]   Right.
[01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:45.920]   That's what Comcast did.
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:47.680]   Well, a lot of it also has to do with Apple.
[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:51.240]   They've always, ever since Steve Jobs returned and came up with the first iMac, the first
[01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:56.760]   thing you notice was snappy because they didn't buffer all, or they did buffer all.
[01:19:56.760 --> 01:19:57.760]   It was tricky.
[01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:59.400]   It was tricky because it really wasn't snappy.
[01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:00.400]   It was psychologically snappy.
[01:20:00.400 --> 01:20:01.400]   Right.
[01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:02.400]   It felt snappy.
[01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:03.400]   Yeah.
[01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:08.200]   They're doing this and they've done it all forever, and Microsoft doesn't care, and Android
[01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:10.200]   just can't quite get the snappy thing going on.
[01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:11.920]   They definitely can't get the snappy.
[01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:14.280]   The iPhone and the iPad are perfect examples of that.
[01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:17.320]   One of the things that people love is when you swipe your finger, it's so responsive.
[01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:18.320]   Yes.
[01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:20.680]   Well, the reason why it does that is it's actually a picture that's moving.
[01:20:20.680 --> 01:20:22.320]   It's not the actual desktop.
[01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:23.320]   On Android, it is.
[01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:24.320]   Is that true, really?
[01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:25.320]   That's true.
[01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:26.320]   That's true.
[01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:27.320]   And it's a cheat, but it works.
[01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:28.320]   It's a great cheat.
[01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:29.320]   It doesn't matter.
[01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:30.320]   Right.
[01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:31.320]   Right.
[01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:32.320]   So, Android, you're actually moving the actual icons, the actual desktop.
[01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:34.320]   You're getting generated, raw it.
[01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:35.320]   Right.
[01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:36.320]   And so Apple brings the snappy.
[01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:39.480]   There's layers of extraction and the fact that consumers don't know or care about the
[01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:40.480]   difference.
[01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:41.480]   Right.
[01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:42.480]   Exactly.
[01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:43.480]   As you're making that transition, you're not pushing any of the icons.
[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:46.720]   All your minor registers is it's either smooth or it's choppy.
[01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:47.720]   Right.
[01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:49.520]   Wow, you're absolutely right.
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:50.520]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:51.520]   So, all right.
[01:20:51.520 --> 01:20:54.320]   Well, let's hope Microsoft learned some techniques.
[01:20:54.320 --> 01:20:55.320]   They...
[01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:56.320]   I think they learned...
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:57.840]   No, I think in XP didn't...
[01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:01.200]   Didn't XP appear to boot faster than it did?
[01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:02.200]   Maybe it was...
[01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:05.400]   Because it would draw the screen even though you couldn't do anything.
[01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:06.600]   Yeah, no, it still does that.
[01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:08.600]   You can load it if you boot XP.
[01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:09.600]   You're not done.
[01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:12.400]   It'll be all up there and then you try to click on stuff, nothing.
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:13.400]   It's downloading.
[01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:15.560]   It takes another five minutes and you can finally get it to work.
[01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:17.480]   They should skip tablets, I think.
[01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:18.480]   Just give up, right?
[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:21.160]   And why don't they just go for glasses and, you know, try...
[01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:23.080]   Oh, look, Google not to talk about it.
[01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:24.720]   The best invention ever.
[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:25.720]   What?
[01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:27.520]   Dumberness, fact of hammer.
[01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:29.160]   Now I'm going to get in the fight with the priest.
[01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:30.160]   I will buy them.
[01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:31.160]   No, no, no.
[01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:32.160]   You will buy them.
[01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:35.520]   I will not buy them, but I'm hoping they give them away at Google I/O.
[01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:36.520]   I'm going.
[01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:37.520]   I'm hoping.
[01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:38.520]   I'm going to be there.
[01:21:38.520 --> 01:21:39.520]   I'm going to get a good idea.
[01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:40.520]   I don't think they'll be ready.
[01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:41.520]   I'm going to be ready.
[01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:42.520]   You know what?
[01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:44.120]   No, there was an episode of Star Trek the next generation.
[01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:45.120]   Stay with me.
[01:21:45.120 --> 01:21:46.120]   The game?
[01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:47.120]   The game.
[01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:48.120]   The game.
[01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:49.120]   The game.
[01:21:49.120 --> 01:21:50.120]   The game.
[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:51.120]   The game.
[01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:52.120]   It helps.
[01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:53.120]   The caller helps isn't it?
[01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:54.120]   Because women then trust you.
[01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:55.920]   And it just made people hypnotized and stupid, granted that was a metaphor and aliens were involved, but we don't need more computing, we need less computing.
[01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:57.000]   This is why I don't have a phone.
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:04.000]   I'm putting an overlay on your eyeball.
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:07.000]   You're just one step away from what, where inside your eyeball.
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:12.000]   Stop playing games, disconnect, ask people for directions, interact with human beings.
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:13.000]   This is a dream.
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:16.000]   You remember that guy we used to have on tech TV?
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.000]   He actually was with the site.
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.000]   Cliff Stoll.
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.000]   Cliff Stoll.
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.000]   She sounds like Cliff Stoll.
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.000]   What ever happened to Cliff?
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.000]   He's still running his astronomer.
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.000]   He's not hooked on anything.
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.000]   Are you in the astronomer?
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:26.000]   Oh, so I talked to my son about this, about the glasses.
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:29.000]   I felt the same way that she does in you.
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:30.000]   And train.
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:31.000]   And I will get them, right?
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:32.000]   Yeah, we'll get them.
[01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:33.000]   Oh, no, you talked to millennials?
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:36.000]   This is going to be the greatest thing since sliced bread for them.
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:37.000]   It's far and far and far and far.
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000]   This is the greatest thing that could ever imagine.
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.000]   John, it's the greatest thing for you too.
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:43.000]   Because how many times do you walk up to somebody you forget?
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.000]   I have no idea who they are.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:45.000]   That's most of the time.
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:46.000]   That's bad manners.
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:47.000]   The glasses.
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.000]   You say, "Hey, you."
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.000]   Hey.
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.000]   No, that's what I do.
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.000]   That's what I do.
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000]   That's the equivalent of drawing the screen on the table.
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.000]   The equivalent of wearing glasses to tell you who people are.
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:59.000]   Oh, because it'll say, "Robert, how are you?
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:00.000]   It's great to see you.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:02.000]   I haven't seen you since May 17th.
[01:23:02.000 --> 01:23:03.000]   It's been really fun.
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.000]   And they won't see your eye wandering.
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:05.000]   Yeah.
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000]   Otherwise, it'll be very interesting to see you again.
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:10.000]   We haven't seen each other since I've gotten.
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:11.000]   No, I've got the bit.
[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:12.000]   I give it to you.
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000]   I've done it before I talk about it.
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:16.000]   So let's say, when I conference, I don't know you.
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.000]   I go after you.
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:18.000]   You know me.
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:19.000]   I know you, but you don't remember me.
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:20.000]   And then I supposedly was mad.
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.000]   I say, "Hey, Leo."
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:24.000]   And I wouldn't say, "Hey, hey, what are you doing?
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000]   What are you working for now?"
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.000]   And then I say, "Let me see your new card."
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.000]   Oh, so good.
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:31.000]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:32.000]   You get the card.
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:33.000]   That's perfect.
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:35.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, look at that.
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:36.000]   Oh, Bruce.
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:38.000]   Oh, I forgot how.
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:39.000]   Oh.
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:40.000]   I always bring a person along.
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:42.000]   I'm like, "Oh, hey, have you met so-and-so?"
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000]   And then the other person has to say, "That's harder."
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:45.000]   Well, you have to have a person.
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:47.000]   Yeah, and you have to have a wingman.
[01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:49.000]   Or you could just have the glasses.
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.000]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:51.000]   So, Trey.
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.000]   You look like a geek with those glasses on Leo.
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.000]   As opposed to...
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.000]   Yeah, what exactly?
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:58.000]   I think I don't like the idea.
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:02.000]   You're going to be the first to get them, because Google loves you, Trey.
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:05.000]   Well, I'll get them at some point, yes.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:07.000]   But the thing is, is why wouldn't you wear the glasses?
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.000]   Because right now we walk around with our cell phones.
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.000]   Right.
[01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:11.000]   I don't say that.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000]   Well, I know, but you're like...
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.000]   I love this.
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.000]   I love this.
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:16.000]   He's got to give me a back time.
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000]   He's dressing me in a dress for someone else.
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.000]   Yeah.
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.000]   Leo, forget it.
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.000]   It's never going to happen.
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:26.000]   And now he's calling me out as an agist.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:29.000]   My only concern is these things are not going to work.
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:32.000]   No, Sergey was wearing them at a party.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000]   Scobble said, "Can I wear them?"
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:35.000]   He said, "No."
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.000]   It just crashed.
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:37.000]   All it does right now is crash.
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:39.000]   Well, he was running Windows then.
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:40.000]   The Windows version.
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:41.000]   He said the reboot's constantly.
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:44.000]   That video, that was pie in the sky.
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:45.000]   They're never going to get these working.
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.000]   Well, of course, they will get them working.
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:48.000]   That was a little early.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:51.000]   You can have flexible transparent screens at CES all over the place.
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:52.000]   No, I think so too.
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.000]   Of course, they're going to have visual over the place.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.000]   Yeah.
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.000]   Yeah.
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:56.000]   It'll be simple.
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:57.000]   I'm working right now.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.000]   I want a monocle, though.
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:24:59.000]   It looks much classier.
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:00.000]   I want something steam-hungry.
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:01.000]   Get the steam on the bed.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.000]   It's going to kink.
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.000]   Actually, it's a horrible idea.
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.000]   I want a long head.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000]   Until it becomes a long head.
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000]   Eyeglasses released next year from Apple.
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:09.000]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:11.000]   Actually, that brings up a point.
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:12.000]   Oh, he's keeping a chest in there.
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:16.000]   The architect, Philip Starks, supposedly, is involved in some Apple project that's going
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:19.000]   to come out just before the end of this year before Christmas.
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:20.000]   TV?
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.000]   No, it won't be a TV because it's going to be the most revolutionary thing
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:25.000]   app the company's ever done.
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000]   It's got to be glasses.
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.000]   When that means Apple makes glasses, Apple makes glasses.
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.000]   Wouldn't it be funny if Starks has done glasses before?
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.000]   This is the key.
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:34.000]   He has.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.000]   He does great glasses.
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:36.000]   Ask glasses a question.
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:37.000]   If Apple, I'll be honest.
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:41.000]   If I had a choice between a Google and an Apple version, wouldn't you buy the Apple
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.000]   for people?
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:45.000]   Well, it might be a better interface.
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.000]   But the Google interface is getting better every day.
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000]   They've got good UI guys.
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:51.000]   There's the glasses.
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:52.000]   There's the glasses.
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:53.000]   Yeah.
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:54.000]   They're kind of just working on something over it.
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:56.000]   So what do you think that Philip Starks thing is?
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000]   If you think it's a TV, I don't think it's a TV.
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:01.000]   That couldn't be the most revolutionary thing that the company's ever done.
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:02.000]   It's not that revolutionary.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.000]   We've been talking about it for two years.
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:05.000]   One thing people complained about.
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:06.000]   Where did you hear this?
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:07.000]   It's all over the place.
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:10.000]   Type in "Philip Starks" the guy we're talking about.
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:11.000]   Internet says so.
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.000]   Internet says so.
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:13.000]   Iron Man.
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:14.000]   Story.
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:15.000]   Starks.
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:16.000]   Internet.
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:17.000]   Philip Starks.
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.000]   Philip Starks.
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:21.000]   The van himself hits a quote from him about this being a revolution.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:22.000]   Oh, really?
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:23.000]   Yes.
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.000]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.000]   I want before Christmas.
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000]   It's like a Jordy War on Starks.
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.000]   Oh, the Pfizer.
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:29.000]   There we go.
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:30.000]   That's what I want.
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:31.000]   Those are my Google glasses.
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:34.000]   So, you know how this has this little form factor with this tiny little piece of glass
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:35.000]   above your eye?
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000]   People said that you won't be able to see that much information on it.
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:41.000]   But you can see a ton of information on a small piece of glass by your eye.
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.000]   Because it's close.
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:43.000]   That's what happens with this.
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.360]   This is a very small thing in here.
[01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:48.160]   But it looks like a 70 inch screen when it's right up against you.
[01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:51.000]   And you can focus on something very close to you.
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:52.000]   Oh, am I doing that?
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:53.000]   Yes.
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000]   You're going to run to the left-hand side.
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000]   It's right in the ears too.
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.000]   Yes.
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.000]   It's going right in the ears.
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:03.000]   Yeah, but because depending on which eye is dominant, it will make the glasses not work.
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:04.000]   Yeah.
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:05.000]   Oh, you're right, John.
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:06.000]   Here it is.
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.000]   Patrick May writing in the San Jose Mercury News.
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:12.000]   The Uber designer Philippe Stock on Friday dropped a juicy hint that he was collaborating
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:18.000]   with Apple's former CEO Steve Jobs on some top secret, but have a revolutionary project
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:21.000]   to be unveiled later this year.
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:25.000]   You know, if this tech thing doesn't work out, I could be calling him Clink.
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:26.000]   Hogan.
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000]   And then you could just appear in Batman.
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:29.000]   You saw that.
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:30.000]   I saw that.
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.000]   Wasn't that weird?
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:32.000]   It's just strange.
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:33.000]   It's so strange.
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:34.000]   You were in Batman?
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000]   No, remember the old 1960s, Adam West?
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000]   Yeah, Paul and Sokol.
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:39.000]   Yeah.
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:44.440]   So there's a montage on YouTube of all the different pop-in cameos that were made during
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:48.640]   the show when Adam, you know, Batman and Rumb would climb up the sides of buildings except
[01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:52.520]   it's really obvious they're just walking sideways with Adam West hunched over Robin
[01:27:52.520 --> 01:27:54.000]   in a rather provocative manner.
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:55.000]   I might add.
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:56.000]   Yeah.
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:59.280]   And people would pop out Sammy Davis Jr. and say, "Hey, man."
[01:27:59.280 --> 01:28:02.080]   And Adam was a citizen.
[01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:03.840]   But there's one with Colonel Clink.
[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:04.840]   Oh, really?
[01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:05.840]   He was big then, though.
[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:07.840]   Yeah, but it's bizarre because he's a Nazi.
[01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:08.840]   Yeah.
[01:28:08.840 --> 01:28:09.840]   In Germany, from World War II.
[01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:10.840]   He's a fun Nazi.
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:11.840]   He's a fun Nazi.
[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:14.760]   And you have Batman saying, "Be careful, Colonel Clink."
[01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:15.760]   They're looking for you.
[01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:16.760]   Why would you be telling him that?
[01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:17.760]   So weird.
[01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:18.760]   That's not very superheroish.
[01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:19.760]   No, it's not.
[01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:22.200]   So anyway, so this is the thing that's going to happen.
[01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:24.400]   And it's got to be something other than the TV.
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:25.400]   You don't bring this guy in.
[01:28:25.400 --> 01:28:26.400]   No, you're right.
[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:28.280]   Apple can do a TV.
[01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:31.280]   Apple says it's not working on anything with Philippe Stark.
[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:32.280]   Now, you know what?
[01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:35.600]   I trust John Pichowski of All Things D. That's who says this.
[01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:41.280]   So maybe Philippe was just kind of looking for some publicity.
[01:28:41.280 --> 01:28:42.280]   Yeah.
[01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:44.080]   I'm going to do something very expensive.
[01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:47.080]   I was thinking I wrote about it at maybe an Apple hotel.
[01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:48.080]   That would make sense.
[01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:50.080]   Maybe it was a different Apple.
[01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:52.080]   This would make sense.
[01:28:52.080 --> 01:28:54.520]   Somebody's working with the Apple Growers Association of War.
[01:28:54.520 --> 01:28:55.520]   Apple, of course.
[01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:58.480]   I trust Mr. Stark more than I trust Apple PR.
[01:28:58.480 --> 01:28:59.480]   That's true.
[01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:00.480]   You know they're going to lie.
[01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:03.920]   They're going to say what's in their best interest.
[01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:04.920]   We don't know of anything.
[01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:07.360]   They're best interest to keep things secret.
[01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:10.560]   Yeah, they're not going to-- because they know if they said, well, we're not going to
[01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:11.560]   comment on that.
[01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:12.560]   That would be a massive mission.
[01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:13.560]   Oh, that's an absolutely interesting one.
[01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:14.560]   Yeah.
[01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:15.560]   And so did the readers.
[01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:19.200]   Well, I mean, you know when you're going to call Apple PR, all they're going to say
[01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:21.000]   is either no or no comment.
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:22.000]   Right.
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:23.000]   Yeah.
[01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.680]   So All Things D reports it as fact.
[01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:26.680]   All Things D--
[01:29:26.680 --> 01:29:27.680]   Well, they reported the Apple set.
[01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:28.680]   Apple denied it.
[01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:29.680]   Which is the fact.
[01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:30.680]   Yeah.
[01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:31.680]   Yes.
[01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:32.680]   Apple denies all.
[01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:33.960]   Oh, redundant.
[01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:34.960]   There's a movie.
[01:29:34.960 --> 01:29:36.440]   There's a Steve Jobs movie coming.
[01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:37.600]   Yeah, Ashton Kutcher.
[01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:42.680]   He's going to play the Young Steve Jobs 1971 through the year 2000.
[01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:43.680]   It's an indie movie.
[01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:47.120]   Well, we got the first part of the story with Pirates of Silicon Valley, did we not?
[01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:49.120]   I would love to have seen Noel Wiley come back.
[01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:50.120]   Yeah.
[01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:51.120]   He was a good to us.
[01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:52.760]   But he doesn't look like him now, right?
[01:29:52.760 --> 01:29:53.760]   Well, he doesn't.
[01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:56.840]   Well, that was what, 20 years ago or something.
[01:29:56.840 --> 01:29:58.360]   We've all aged a little bit, John.
[01:29:58.360 --> 01:29:59.360]   Not you.
[01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:00.360]   You look exactly the same.
[01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:01.360]   Actually, he does.
[01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:02.360]   It's very weird.
[01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:03.360]   It's kind of uncanny.
[01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:09.600]   But it's nice that you'd say so after humiliating me over and over again, earlier in the show.
[01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:10.600]   But what?
[01:30:10.600 --> 01:30:11.600]   By dressing you in a dress?
[01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:12.600]   Well, you didn't manage to do it.
[01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:13.600]   You get a nice dress.
[01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:16.440]   It's not going to be like some plain Jane thing.
[01:30:16.440 --> 01:30:17.440]   Yeah.
[01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:18.440]   Well, what's--
[01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:19.440]   It could be a gown.
[01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:20.440]   Would you prefer that?
[01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:21.440]   This will get bad very quickly.
[01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:22.440]   A gown.
[01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:25.640]   The movie title is called-- oh, this is not good.
[01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:26.840]   Jobs, colon.
[01:30:26.840 --> 01:30:27.840]   Get inspired.
[01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:28.840]   Ew.
[01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:29.840]   No, that's bull crap.
[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:30.840]   That can't be the name of it.
[01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:31.840]   No, that must be a working title.
[01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:35.600]   According to Ashton Kutcher and producer Mark Ew--
[01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:39.600]   You don't think Ashton Kutcher's punking everybody with this bull crap?
[01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:41.960]   This could be an elaborate episode.
[01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:46.720]   It'll pre-- there's no iPod because it came out a year later.
[01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:48.920]   In fact, it just gets Jobs back at Apple.
[01:30:48.920 --> 01:30:51.040]   It's really the early Apple.
[01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:52.040]   This is a punk job.
[01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:53.560]   You think it's made up?
[01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:54.560]   Yeah.
[01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:56.720]   I think it might be wishful thinking.
[01:30:56.720 --> 01:31:01.000]   I think the tech community has a certain amount of anger toward Mr. Kutcher.
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:04.320]   And I think the entertainment industry is beginning to feel the same way about him.
[01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:05.320]   How interesting, really?
[01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:10.240]   Well, no, because yeah, I was at the tech founders galloping whatever with Mr. Fancy
[01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:12.080]   Pants, rich tech guys.
[01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:16.680]   And they had a Mr. Fancy Pants Entertainment guy there as well, one of the guys from Big
[01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:17.680]   Bang Theory.
[01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:20.280]   And he got up and said, you know, we have something in common.
[01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:21.840]   We all hate Ashton Kutcher.
[01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:22.840]   Wow.
[01:31:22.840 --> 01:31:23.840]   Yeah.
[01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:24.840]   Poor Ashton.
[01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:25.840]   What did he do to deserve that?
[01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:28.920]   Well, he came around and started investing in companies and trying to make geek them a
[01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:29.920]   cool guy thing.
[01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:32.560]   I think all the geeks presented that.
[01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:36.320]   This is a John C. Devorak in 19.
[01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:38.320]   I think 80.
[01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:39.320]   Wow.
[01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:40.320]   Wow.
[01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:41.320]   See, it looks exactly.
[01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:45.560]   Yeah, if I had those big giant glasses, which I do, the tech rots works or the tech.
[01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:46.560]   No, it's the tech.
[01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:47.560]   You're kidding.
[01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:48.560]   The tech rots is wearing those glasses.
[01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:49.560]   Yeah, those glasses.
[01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:50.560]   Wow.
[01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:54.360]   That's Gary Kildall, who's the late Gary Kildall founder of DR DOS, Digital Research.
[01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:56.880]   And there, my friends, is a handsome.
[01:31:56.880 --> 01:31:57.880]   Who are those glasses?
[01:31:57.880 --> 01:32:00.280]   It's like two Hubble telescopes in orbit, right?
[01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:02.480]   That was like this.
[01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:04.520]   That was that era when those glasses were invoked.
[01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:05.520]   Aviator glasses.
[01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:06.520]   Yeah.
[01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:07.520]   So I think it's just a bright.
[01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:08.520]   You look pretty young, Gerald.
[01:32:08.520 --> 01:32:09.520]   Yes.
[01:32:09.520 --> 01:32:10.520]   You look pretty young, actually.
[01:32:10.520 --> 01:32:12.520]   You look pretty good in that.
[01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:13.920]   I don't even mean these shows.
[01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:15.200]   They put us on once.
[01:32:15.200 --> 01:32:17.440]   You do something kind of goofy or done.
[01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:18.960]   Yeah, but you don't get on the show.
[01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:19.960]   Look at the computer.
[01:32:19.960 --> 01:32:20.960]   Yeah.
[01:32:20.960 --> 01:32:21.960]   Holy cow.
[01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:22.960]   State of the art PC junior.
[01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:23.960]   You're a little bit like a groovy.
[01:32:23.960 --> 01:32:24.960]   No, that was a PS2.
[01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:25.960]   That's a PS2.
[01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:26.960]   Oh.
[01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:28.280]   That looks a little bit like that.
[01:32:28.280 --> 01:32:29.280]   That's a mean thing to say.
[01:32:29.280 --> 01:32:30.280]   Well, you guys have just been mean today.
[01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:31.880]   We are really beating up on John.
[01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:33.680]   Please, let's be nice to John.
[01:32:33.680 --> 01:32:34.680]   I got that.
[01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:35.680]   Be nice.
[01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:36.680]   Go to knowajannahshow.com.
[01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:37.680]   Give him one of your buns.
[01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:38.680]   Divorak.org/NA.
[01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:39.680]   The one.
[01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:40.680]   The one.
[01:32:40.680 --> 01:32:41.680]   True mom.
[01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:42.680]   Seriously.
[01:32:42.680 --> 01:32:44.200]   Did you have any of her buns?
[01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:45.200]   They're really good.
[01:32:45.200 --> 01:32:46.200]   I've had her buns.
[01:32:46.200 --> 01:32:47.200]   Yeah.
[01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:48.200]   No, I don't.
[01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:49.200]   But I mean, today, though.
[01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:50.400]   You had these?
[01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:51.400]   Did you have one?
[01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:52.400]   You have a bite?
[01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:53.400]   Hello.
[01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:54.400]   Hello?
[01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:55.400]   Because they're really worried.
[01:32:55.400 --> 01:32:56.400]   They're much better when they're hot.
[01:32:56.400 --> 01:32:57.400]   They're not going to be hot.
[01:32:57.400 --> 01:32:58.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:32:58.400 --> 01:32:59.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:00.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:01.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:02.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:03.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:33:03.400 --> 01:33:04.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:33:04.400 --> 01:33:05.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:33:05.400 --> 01:33:06.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:07.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:08.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:09.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:10.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:11.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:12.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:33:12.400 --> 01:33:13.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:14.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:33:14.400 --> 01:33:21.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:24.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:33:24.400 --> 01:33:25.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:26.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:27.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:28.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:29.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:30.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:31.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:32.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:33.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:34.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:35.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:33:35.400 --> 01:33:36.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:37.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:38.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:39.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:33:39.400 --> 01:33:40.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:45.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:52.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:55.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:33:55.400 --> 01:33:58.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:01.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:04.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:09.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.

[01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:28.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:42:28.400 --> 01:42:30.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.

[01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:40.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:42.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:42:42.400 --> 01:42:44.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:46.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:48.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:50.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:52.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:54.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:56.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:42:56.400 --> 01:42:58.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:42:58.400 --> 01:43:00.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:02.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:43:02.400 --> 01:43:04.400]   I'm not going to be a bad guy.
[01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:06.400]   I don't know.
[01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:08.400]   It'll be hard to motivate the same
[01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:12.400]   sort of resistance to SISPA
[01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:14.400]   as we had with SOPA because
[01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:16.400]   the big thing on SOPA, the thing that people could
[01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:18.400]   latch onto was the fact that they were
[01:43:18.400 --> 01:43:20.400]   legislating a really bad tech.
[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:21.400]   Right.
[01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:22.400]   A really bad tech idea.
[01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:24.400]   That's how you got the 83 engineers who invented
[01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:26.400]   the internet writing against it.
[01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:27.400]   Exactly.
[01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:28.400]   This is more benign.
[01:43:28.400 --> 01:43:30.400]   This is much more benign until you look, as you
[01:43:30.400 --> 01:43:32.400]   mentioned, the really vague wording of
[01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:34.400]   action against anything that might be a threat.
[01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:36.400]   What exactly does that mean?
[01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:38.400]   Basically, it indemnifies.
[01:43:38.400 --> 01:43:40.400]   Let's say Facebook is asked by the
[01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:42.400]   Homeland Security to give them
[01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:44.400]   completely unrestricted access to your information.
[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:46.400]   They often are and they will and they do.
[01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:48.400]   Well, now it's completely okay.
[01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:50.400]   It was completely okay before.
[01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:53.400]   They disclose that they do that and they give
[01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:56.400]   annual reports on the information that they get
[01:43:56.400 --> 01:43:58.400]   and the warrants they comply with.
[01:43:58.400 --> 01:44:01.400]   It's either redundant or it's a complete trick
[01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:03.400]   to make something else legal that they're not making
[01:44:03.400 --> 01:44:05.400]   the use cases for right now.
[01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:07.400]   It could be a stepping stone the government wants
[01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:10.400]   just to have full access all the time.
[01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:12.400]   Because there is the idea is open to the government.
[01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:15.400]   These courts keep coming up with things like, you know,
[01:44:15.400 --> 01:44:18.400]   Fifth Amendment protections are right against
[01:44:18.400 --> 01:44:20.400]   unreasonable search and seizure.
[01:44:20.400 --> 01:44:23.400]   They keep coming up with that silly constitutional
[01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:24.400]   law stuff.
[01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:27.400]   So let's just let's just shrine this in a law that says,
[01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:31.400]   Hey, basically the US government can look at any
[01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:34.400]   online communication as long as there's reason to
[01:44:34.400 --> 01:44:38.400]   suspect and they use this phrase cyber crime
[01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:41.400]   or a threat of intellectual property theft.
[01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:42.400]   Wait a minute.
[01:44:42.400 --> 01:44:43.400]   Did you hear that one?
[01:44:43.400 --> 01:44:44.400]   Yeah.
[01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:49.400]   Or a threat of intellectual property theft.
[01:44:49.400 --> 01:44:52.400]   The bill defined cyber security systems and cyber
[01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:54.400]   threat information as anything related to protecting
[01:44:54.400 --> 01:44:57.400]   networks from a, efforts to degrade, disrupt,
[01:44:57.400 --> 01:45:00.400]   destroy such systems or networks or be theft or
[01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:03.400]   misappropriation of private.
[01:45:03.400 --> 01:45:06.400]   Well, DHS already shuts down websites whenever they
[01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:07.400]   feel like it.
[01:45:07.400 --> 01:45:09.400]   You know, they shut down torrenting websites.
[01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:13.400]   They shut down a whole slate of them a couple years ago.
[01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:15.400]   And people started freaking out like, why is
[01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:17.400]   Homeland Security taking down this website and putting
[01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:18.400]   up the government seal?
[01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:19.400]   It just scares me that the conflate--
[01:45:19.400 --> 01:45:21.400]   I don't know why I think they need another law to do
[01:45:21.400 --> 01:45:22.400]   what they've been doing.
[01:45:22.400 --> 01:45:25.400]   IP theft with terrorism.
[01:45:25.400 --> 01:45:27.400]   That's what really scares me.
[01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:29.400]   So what you're saying is that essentially the government
[01:45:29.400 --> 01:45:32.400]   can float around and then one day just shut down
[01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:35.400]   anybody, me and you're done.
[01:45:35.400 --> 01:45:37.400]   Because of IP theft because, you know, maybe we had a
[01:45:37.400 --> 01:45:40.400]   clip from YouTube or something on our, on our
[01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:41.400]   shows.
[01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:42.400]   Yeah, John's going to go after you for that clip that you
[01:45:42.400 --> 01:45:43.400]   had up for now.
[01:45:43.400 --> 01:45:44.400]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:45:44.400 --> 01:45:46.400]   Actually that clip that I just played would be enough for
[01:45:46.400 --> 01:45:47.400]   them to do that.
[01:45:47.400 --> 01:45:48.400]   If they wanted to.
[01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:50.400]   If Stuart Schaffay decided I didn't like me.
[01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:51.400]   Whatever happened to him anyway?
[01:45:51.400 --> 01:45:52.400]   He's still around.
[01:45:52.400 --> 01:45:53.400]   In fact, people keep saying I should get him on one of our
[01:45:53.400 --> 01:45:54.400]   shows.
[01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:56.400]   He's like living in New England.
[01:45:56.400 --> 01:45:58.400]   Why don't you get him on one of your shows when he's in the
[01:45:58.400 --> 01:45:59.400]   Bay Area?
[01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:01.400]   He's in Vermont or somewhere.
[01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:04.400]   The EFF has an online tool where you can, of course,
[01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:06.400]   contact your representative and say, I don't like this.
[01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:07.400]   But you're right, Robert.
[01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:10.400]   I don't think we're going to see this massive up swelling
[01:46:10.400 --> 01:46:14.400]   even though, frankly, even though you may say, Jolie,
[01:46:14.400 --> 01:46:16.400]   oh, they already have, they're already doing all that.
[01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:18.400]   We can only get people worked up about litigation.
[01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:19.400]   Once.
[01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:20.400]   Apparently.
[01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:22.400]   You're maybe once every two years.
[01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:24.400]   Yeah, you keep hounding it with more and more.
[01:46:24.400 --> 01:46:26.400]   You drop, you kill this one and another one.
[01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:28.400]   This is like prostitution in Hollywood.
[01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:29.400]   Or whack-a-mole in my.
[01:46:29.400 --> 01:46:30.400]   Same thing.
[01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:33.400]   There's also a sort of an inside the beltway mentality here
[01:46:33.400 --> 01:46:35.400]   that people have to take into account.
[01:46:35.400 --> 01:46:39.400]   That is, D.C., where I live, it's filled with lobbyists.
[01:46:39.400 --> 01:46:42.400]   It's filled with offices that have people who do this all
[01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:43.400]   day.
[01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:45.400]   And so they just received a big smackdown from SOPA.
[01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:48.400]   They want something that justify their jobs.
[01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:50.400]   And so, of course, they're going to be reaching out to the
[01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:53.400]   legislators that are friendly and they're going to say,
[01:46:53.400 --> 01:46:54.400]   well, here's something else.
[01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:57.400]   It's not quite SOPA, but it is something we could put in our
[01:46:57.400 --> 01:46:58.400]   win column.
[01:46:58.400 --> 01:47:00.400]   And if they can, they get screwed on this deal.
[01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:02.400]   Eventually, they're going to fall back on the old.
[01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:06.400]   It's going to show up as an anti-child porn law.
[01:47:06.400 --> 01:47:08.400]   That's got nothing to do with child pornography.
[01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:10.400]   It's got all, it's basically the same stuff.
[01:47:10.400 --> 01:47:12.400]   They just have all the stuff in there.
[01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:14.400]   They're ready at the.
[01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:16.400]   It'll get snuck into an appropriations bill.
[01:47:16.400 --> 01:47:18.400]   That's how it works.
[01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:19.400]   That's how to do it.
[01:47:19.400 --> 01:47:22.400]   Eventually, you might as well just give up, you're doomed.
[01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:24.400]   Here's one thing I'm not going to do.
[01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:27.400]   Publish pictures of my loved one's breasts.
[01:47:27.400 --> 01:47:32.400]   That's how Hijinio Ochoa, 30 year old hacker and Linux
[01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:36.400]   administrator from Galveston, Texas, got arrested by the FBI.
[01:47:36.400 --> 01:47:37.400]   Why?
[01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:40.400]   He hacked into several websites belonging to law enforcement.
[01:47:40.400 --> 01:47:41.400]   Usually a bad idea.
[01:47:41.400 --> 01:47:42.400]   I wouldn't advise it.
[01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:45.400]   Was he doing it in a gray hat way or a white hat way?
[01:47:45.400 --> 01:47:47.400]   That way it was black hat.
[01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:48.400]   What was he doing?
[01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:54.400]   He left a calling card, which was, he used a Twitter account to direct people to a website,
[01:47:54.400 --> 01:47:58.400]   where all the law enforcement information he hacked was on display.
[01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:07.400]   Also on that website was a picture of a woman, his girlfriend apparently, with a sign that
[01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:12.400]   said "Poned by Wurmer and Cabin Crew, Heart You Bitches."
[01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:13.400]   I won't show you the picture.
[01:48:13.400 --> 01:48:16.400]   Well, I'll show you the picture, Jolie, because you've seen these before.
[01:48:16.400 --> 01:48:19.400]   But you can't see it, John.
[01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:20.400]   What does that mean?
[01:48:20.400 --> 01:48:22.400]   She's seen these before.
[01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:23.400]   She has cable.
[01:48:23.400 --> 01:48:24.400]   She has cable.
[01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:25.400]   I don't actually know.
[01:48:25.400 --> 01:48:26.400]   I don't know.
[01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:27.400]   I don't know.
[01:48:27.400 --> 01:48:28.400]   Do not know.
[01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:33.400]   What's weird is foolishly, he took the picture with an iPhone and left the GPS information
[01:48:33.400 --> 01:48:34.400]   in the image.
[01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:37.400]   What kind of a hacker is this guy?
[01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:38.400]   New.
[01:48:38.400 --> 01:48:39.400]   New boy.
[01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:40.400]   So.
[01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:41.400]   So then what happened?
[01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:42.400]   So they arrested him.
[01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:44.400]   Well, not because of the breasts.
[01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:47.400]   No, they found him because of the breasts.
[01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:49.400]   They used breast recognition techniques.
[01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:50.400]   They found them because of the...
[01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:52.400]   I think that would be interesting in the glasses.
[01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:53.400]   That's that.
[01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:55.400]   Yeah, that's built into the Google glasses.
[01:48:55.400 --> 01:48:57.400]   Body part recognition.
[01:48:57.400 --> 01:48:58.400]   Did you see this?
[01:48:58.400 --> 01:49:00.400]   Yeah, linking fake fake.
[01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:04.400]   I got an email from the guys behind this Kickstarter project and they said we'd love it if you'd
[01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:05.400]   publicize it.
[01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:06.400]   I don't know why.
[01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:07.400]   Another one.
[01:49:07.400 --> 01:49:08.400]   That is awesome.
[01:49:08.400 --> 01:49:09.400]   I don't know why.
[01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:10.400]   The Nano watch was a thing.
[01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:14.400]   Like when the Nano came out, that was a Kickstarter project and it was kind of unique.
[01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:16.400]   And now this is like the third.
[01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:18.400]   Okay, but you do want these watches.
[01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:20.400]   This week is one of the cooler.
[01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:21.400]   These are e-ink watches.
[01:49:21.400 --> 01:49:22.400]   Okay, not regular.
[01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:23.400]   You can actually buy.
[01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:26.960]   Somebody makes e-ink watches already, but this guy wants to make e-ink watches with the kind
[01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:30.160]   of screen that you have on the Kindle, for instance.
[01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:31.400]   So you're going to do this.
[01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:32.400]   Well, wait a minute.
[01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:33.400]   Look at this.
[01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:34.400]   They wanted a hundred thousand dollar gold.
[01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:36.400]   They've raised two point eight million dollars in two days.
[01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:37.400]   Well, the sucker's born every day.
[01:49:37.400 --> 01:49:38.400]   No kidding.
[01:49:38.400 --> 01:49:40.800]   You passed the Jobs Act and look at this.
[01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:43.120]   Yeah, they got the dream team there.
[01:49:43.120 --> 01:49:47.880]   I like this because I don't think that only Apple users look incredibly geeky walking
[01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:49.560]   around with this Nano watches.
[01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:50.560]   I want something for Android.
[01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:51.560]   I mean, really?
[01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:52.560]   Come on.
[01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:53.560]   Let's be fair.
[01:49:53.560 --> 01:49:54.560]   What is that?
[01:49:54.560 --> 01:49:55.560]   Is that a Nano watch?
[01:49:55.560 --> 01:49:56.560]   This is one of those Nano watches.
[01:49:56.560 --> 01:49:57.560]   It's really funny.
[01:49:57.560 --> 01:49:58.560]   That was the Kickstarter project.
[01:49:58.560 --> 01:49:59.560]   It's like I just re-making them in the middle.
[01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:00.560]   But they only raised like 30 grand or something for this.
[01:50:00.560 --> 01:50:03.920]   They've got two point eight million dollars for these e-ink watches.
[01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:05.920]   Two point eight million dollars for it.
[01:50:05.920 --> 01:50:06.920]   It's a nice watch.
[01:50:06.920 --> 01:50:07.920]   Look at them.
[01:50:07.920 --> 01:50:08.920]   It's beautiful.
[01:50:08.920 --> 01:50:09.920]   That's Helvetica.
[01:50:09.920 --> 01:50:11.920]   You can't go wrong with Helvetica.
[01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:12.920]   Wow.
[01:50:12.920 --> 01:50:13.920]   That was not Helvetica.
[01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:14.920]   Yeah.
[01:50:14.920 --> 01:50:16.400]   Outdoor readable display.
[01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:17.400]   It's very geeky.
[01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:19.320]   I think most of you are sloping geeky.
[01:50:19.320 --> 01:50:20.560]   It's a watch.
[01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:22.120]   Most wrist watches you can read outdoors.
[01:50:22.120 --> 01:50:24.320]   I believe I may be wrong on that.
[01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:25.520]   But Kickstarter is awesome.
[01:50:25.520 --> 01:50:26.520]   Yeah.
[01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:30.080]   But I think there may be a rational exuberance on Kickstarter now.
[01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:31.080]   I don't know.
[01:50:31.080 --> 01:50:32.080]   I mean, if you want it, just...
[01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:33.080]   I guess everybody...
[01:50:33.080 --> 01:50:34.080]   If you think it's cool, you want it.
[01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:35.080]   Everybody who's pledged is...
[01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:36.080]   You're live.
[01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:37.080]   You want the one.
[01:50:37.080 --> 01:50:40.600]   If you pledge $99, you get one.
[01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:41.600]   You get a watch.
[01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:42.600]   Jet Black.
[01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:45.920]   $115, you get a watch and free shipping.
[01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:46.920]   What?
[01:50:46.920 --> 01:50:49.840]   Not exactly free kind of free.
[01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:52.400]   It doesn't sound right.
[01:50:52.400 --> 01:50:56.920]   $125, you get a watch in any color.
[01:50:56.920 --> 01:50:58.800]   But free shipping in the US.
[01:50:58.800 --> 01:51:00.600]   There's a whole generation saying, "What's a watch?"
[01:51:00.600 --> 01:51:01.680]   Yeah, no kidding.
[01:51:01.680 --> 01:51:02.680]   So what is this?
[01:51:02.680 --> 01:51:04.440]   I don't know, but that looks...
[01:51:04.440 --> 01:51:05.440]   It's a Buddha.
[01:51:05.440 --> 01:51:06.440]   Yeah.
[01:51:06.440 --> 01:51:07.440]   I don't drink it because Tony...
[01:51:07.440 --> 01:51:08.440]   No, I'm not going to drink it.
[01:51:08.440 --> 01:51:09.440]   Because there's a lot of them.
[01:51:09.440 --> 01:51:10.440]   Yeah, I'm going to drink it anyway.
[01:51:10.440 --> 01:51:11.440]   Yeah, though.
[01:51:11.440 --> 01:51:15.360]   So I just want to point out that you can, in fact, already buy eink watches.
[01:51:15.360 --> 01:51:16.840]   There's a lot of them.
[01:51:16.840 --> 01:51:22.000]   Probably Philippe Stark designed eink watches.
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:23.760]   Phosphorus made one for a long time.
[01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:27.360]   That looks oddly similar to the one that just raised 2.3 million.
[01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:30.960]   It looks exactly the same if you could try it.
[01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:31.960]   Yeah, isn't that odd?
[01:51:31.960 --> 01:51:32.960]   Odd.
[01:51:32.960 --> 01:51:36.120]   Can you start up a Kickstarter for something you've already made?
[01:51:36.120 --> 01:51:37.120]   Mmm, I don't know.
[01:51:37.120 --> 01:51:38.120]   We tried to...
[01:51:38.120 --> 01:51:39.640]   We wanted to do Kickstarter for the bricks.
[01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:41.800]   I'm just jealous because they said no.
[01:51:41.800 --> 01:51:43.360]   They said you can't.
[01:51:43.360 --> 01:51:44.360]   I don't know why.
[01:51:44.360 --> 01:51:45.360]   They don't like us.
[01:51:45.360 --> 01:51:50.080]   Don't you think Kickstarter has some obligation to make sure that the products that they're
[01:51:50.080 --> 01:51:56.760]   endorsing and allowing to be funded on their platform aren't blatant IP violations and knockoffs
[01:51:56.760 --> 01:51:57.760]   and crap?
[01:51:57.760 --> 01:52:02.680]   Well, if you become the funding mechanism for some sort of IP theft, then yeah, you do
[01:52:02.680 --> 01:52:04.320]   have a responsibility.
[01:52:04.320 --> 01:52:08.360]   I would not consider this not IP theft.
[01:52:08.360 --> 01:52:10.120]   I mean, I'm no expert.
[01:52:10.120 --> 01:52:15.800]   I'm going to wrap this up with a 90-year-old boy named Kane Monroy who wanted an arcade.
[01:52:15.800 --> 01:52:17.800]   This is wonderful.
[01:52:17.800 --> 01:52:23.760]   He built one in his dad's used auto parts store at a cart board.
[01:52:23.760 --> 01:52:26.480]   Maybe at my result.
[01:52:26.480 --> 01:52:28.840]   My arcade is called "Cans are Cade".
[01:52:28.840 --> 01:52:29.840]   It's open songs.
[01:52:29.840 --> 01:52:30.840]   We can only.
[01:52:30.840 --> 01:52:31.840]   And it's good.
[01:52:31.840 --> 01:52:37.120]   This is a canes arcade.com.
[01:52:37.120 --> 01:52:38.120]   C-A-I-N-E-S.
[01:52:38.120 --> 01:52:39.120]   It's on the cart board boxes.
[01:52:39.120 --> 01:52:47.880]   Now I got to say, there's probably kids who have been doing this from time immemorial.
[01:52:47.880 --> 01:52:50.240]   But thanks to the internet and Vimeo.
[01:52:50.240 --> 01:52:52.160]   Yeah, we get to school.
[01:52:52.160 --> 01:52:55.560]   We can all share in canes.
[01:52:55.560 --> 01:52:57.240]   Will you jump to 255?
[01:52:57.240 --> 01:52:58.240]   255 in.
[01:52:58.240 --> 01:53:01.920]   There, yeah, 255 to 330.
[01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:04.120]   Oh, you can't jump ahead on Vimeo to let it buffer up a little bit.
[01:53:04.120 --> 01:53:05.480]   Yeah, I have to get it.
[01:53:05.480 --> 01:53:06.480]   Almost there.
[01:53:06.480 --> 01:53:09.160]   And it kept him out of my hair all summer.
[01:53:09.160 --> 01:53:10.160]   It's pretty cute.
[01:53:10.160 --> 01:53:11.160]   Nine years old.
[01:53:11.160 --> 01:53:12.640]   He's got the tape gun.
[01:53:12.640 --> 01:53:14.440]   He's taping up the cardboard.
[01:53:14.440 --> 01:53:18.640]   At nine years, the only good tech is cardboard box.
[01:53:18.640 --> 01:53:19.640]   He's actually pretty good.
[01:53:19.640 --> 01:53:20.640]   He's got army men.
[01:53:20.640 --> 01:53:21.640]   That's true.
[01:53:21.640 --> 01:53:24.720]   That's going to influence my parents.
[01:53:24.720 --> 01:53:25.720]   Dad knows that.
[01:53:25.720 --> 01:53:26.720]   Had to pull.
[01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:30.760]   Yeah, he's got a little f2.8 lens on there.
[01:53:30.760 --> 01:53:31.760]   Yeah.
[01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:34.800]   I'll give it a four star hard game challenging game.
[01:53:34.800 --> 01:53:36.320]   You know what the chat room is, right?
[01:53:36.320 --> 01:53:38.240]   You could never get away with that as a fan.
[01:53:38.240 --> 01:53:40.240]   Just really had a cat.
[01:53:40.240 --> 01:53:41.240]   That's old.
[01:53:41.240 --> 01:53:42.240]   Yes.
[01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:43.240]   Cats own all boxes.
[01:53:43.240 --> 01:53:44.240]   Why don't you just build it?
[01:53:44.240 --> 01:53:45.240]   So you got an ass hook.
[01:53:45.240 --> 01:53:46.800]   Put a piece of yarn on it.
[01:53:46.800 --> 01:53:47.800]   Just made a claw machine.
[01:53:47.800 --> 01:53:50.640]   And then put a little track on top of the box.
[01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:52.920]   And I said, this is this nine year olds going somewhere.
[01:53:52.920 --> 01:53:55.720]   Now watch this thing with the calculators right after this.
[01:53:55.720 --> 01:53:57.320]   With a string and a hook.
[01:53:57.320 --> 01:53:58.320]   Here's some sunglasses.
[01:53:58.320 --> 01:53:59.320]   Who look glasses?
[01:53:59.320 --> 01:54:01.120]   I like the most.
[01:54:01.120 --> 01:54:02.120]   Go go glasses.
[01:54:02.120 --> 01:54:03.120]   Source sunglasses.
[01:54:03.120 --> 01:54:04.760]   This kid will be working at Google about ten years.
[01:54:04.760 --> 01:54:05.760]   Look at all the calculators.
[01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:06.760]   Look at all the calculators.
[01:54:06.760 --> 01:54:07.760]   They put on every arcade game.
[01:54:07.760 --> 01:54:08.760]   And I go, what's that for?
[01:54:08.760 --> 01:54:11.760]   The calculator is right here for security to start the rule.
[01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:12.760]   Watch watch.
[01:54:12.760 --> 01:54:13.760]   Watch.
[01:54:13.760 --> 01:54:16.360]   On the back, the fun fast has the card number.
[01:54:16.360 --> 01:54:21.000]   So when you go here, you have to turn it on and put a pin number in it.
[01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:24.800]   And you have a check mark button and the big number comes out.
[01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:26.680]   He does the square root.
[01:54:26.680 --> 01:54:28.320]   Check mark button.
[01:54:28.320 --> 01:54:32.920]   OK, there's some sort of weird genius going on here.
[01:54:32.920 --> 01:54:39.320]   That's actually better than a lot of network security out there.
[01:54:39.320 --> 01:54:40.920]   That is just a great story.
[01:54:40.920 --> 01:54:43.600]   You can read more about it at canes or actually watch the video.
[01:54:43.600 --> 01:54:44.600]   Canesarcade.com.
[01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:47.640]   Robert, I'm so glad you're here.
[01:54:47.640 --> 01:54:48.640]   Thank you for being here.
[01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:49.640]   This is kind of spontaneous.
[01:54:49.640 --> 01:54:51.040]   You were just driving up anyway to visit.
[01:54:51.040 --> 01:54:52.040]   Right.
[01:54:52.040 --> 01:54:53.040]   I thought, let's get this guy on.
[01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:57.720]   Well, I was hoping that I could get this liquid pelled.
[01:54:57.720 --> 01:54:58.720]   You know what?
[01:54:58.720 --> 01:55:01.120]   I think the truth of liquid pell is it doesn't really matter.
[01:55:01.120 --> 01:55:03.040]   One way or the other, dunk it if you want to.
[01:55:03.040 --> 01:55:05.480]   That's really the rule of the rule of thumb.
[01:55:05.480 --> 01:55:10.000]   You can find out more about Robert and his work at thetechgeek.
[01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:11.000]   What is it?
[01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:12.000]   Thetechstop.net.
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:13.000]   Thetechstop.net.
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:22.240]   He's @padre S.J. both on Twitter and in our chatroom, Padre S.J.
[01:55:22.240 --> 01:55:25.400]   It's really great to have you.
[01:55:25.400 --> 01:55:27.680]   We're going to talk because I want to do an enterprise show.
[01:55:27.680 --> 01:55:29.840]   Oh, you have my little pony as your desktop.
[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:30.840]   I do.
[01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:31.840]   I'm not talking about Father.
[01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:32.840]   No.
[01:55:32.840 --> 01:55:34.480]   No, I've got ponies on Father Robert.
[01:55:34.480 --> 01:55:35.480]   Oh, you do.
[01:55:35.480 --> 01:55:37.960]   I did not just screw with my coworkers.
[01:55:37.960 --> 01:55:40.440]   Jolie Odell has my little pony desktop.
[01:55:40.440 --> 01:55:41.440]   It's so nice to have you.
[01:55:41.440 --> 01:55:42.440]   Thank you so much.
[01:55:42.440 --> 01:55:46.000]   Thank you for being this delicious, free the bap and a free, panofuille.
[01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:48.080]   Panofuille with the little cream cheese.
[01:55:48.080 --> 01:55:49.080]   That was so good.
[01:55:49.080 --> 01:55:50.080]   I'm happy that you like it.
[01:55:50.080 --> 01:55:51.080]   Really delicious.
[01:55:51.080 --> 01:55:52.080]   Really delicious.
[01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:54.680]   The Macliff is getting out and about.
[01:55:54.680 --> 01:55:56.120]   You were at the EG conference speaking.
[01:55:56.120 --> 01:55:58.600]   Are we going to be like the TED conference, right?
[01:55:58.600 --> 01:55:59.600]   Yeah.
[01:55:59.600 --> 01:56:00.600]   It's like the TED conference.
[01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:04.800]   They bring in entertainers and signers and artists and it's three days of short little
[01:56:04.800 --> 01:56:07.720]   talks just like TED.
[01:56:07.720 --> 01:56:08.720]   It was great.
[01:56:08.720 --> 01:56:09.720]   It's really inspirational.
[01:56:09.720 --> 01:56:12.880]   They get a lot of unique people that no one's ever heard of in there.
[01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:14.840]   It's just a wonderful inspirational weekend.
[01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:16.000]   They put all their videos up.
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:17.000]   I was going to ask.
[01:56:17.000 --> 01:56:19.160]   I can see your talk on the IG site.
[01:56:19.160 --> 01:56:20.160]   It'll be up soon.
[01:56:20.160 --> 01:56:22.160]   I talked from last year's up there.
[01:56:22.160 --> 01:56:25.200]   It's about how do you become an artist on the internet?
[01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:27.440]   How and why do you share your stuff?
[01:56:27.440 --> 01:56:31.360]   How can you find yourself in today's world?
[01:56:31.360 --> 01:56:33.160]   That was my talk last time.
[01:56:33.160 --> 01:56:36.000]   This time it was all new stuff.
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:37.000]   Wow.
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:38.000]   Lots of great people too.
[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:39.000]   There's Adam Savage.
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:40.520]   Neil Stevenson gave a talk.
[01:56:40.520 --> 01:56:42.000]   You had dinner with Neil Stevenson.
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:43.720]   I'm kind of jealous here.
[01:56:43.720 --> 01:56:45.160]   That guy is cool.
[01:56:45.160 --> 01:56:46.160]   Oh, yes.
[01:56:46.160 --> 01:56:47.840]   He's the king.
[01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:49.440]   There's another great audible recommendation.
[01:56:49.440 --> 01:56:52.320]   I presume you've read all of it or listened to all of his books.
[01:56:52.320 --> 01:56:53.320]   Not all of it.
[01:56:53.320 --> 01:56:54.320]   He's got a lot of books.
[01:56:54.320 --> 01:56:56.320]   Yeah, if that's true, I have it in the list.
[01:56:56.320 --> 01:56:58.320]   I love Snow Crash and Anandam.
[01:56:58.320 --> 01:56:59.320]   Kryptonomicon, Snow Crash.
[01:56:59.320 --> 01:57:01.120]   Diamond Age is great too.
[01:57:01.120 --> 01:57:02.120]   Yep.
[01:57:02.120 --> 01:57:03.120]   I actually loved Anathem.
[01:57:03.120 --> 01:57:04.360]   I don't think a lot of people didn't.
[01:57:04.360 --> 01:57:10.040]   I wasn't crazy about ReemD as a new one, but to each his own, oh, Marco Tempest is fun.
[01:57:10.040 --> 01:57:11.040]   He's cyber illusionist.
[01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:12.600]   He did all kinds of new stuff.
[01:57:12.600 --> 01:57:14.000]   He does great stuff.
[01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:17.040]   So that is the-e-g.com.
[01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:20.000]   You can find trays or a speech there at some point.
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.880]   And then StuckInKestems.com is your website, the app.
[01:57:22.880 --> 01:57:23.880]   There's several.
[01:57:23.880 --> 01:57:24.880]   There's StuckInTheWorld.com.
[01:57:24.880 --> 01:57:25.880]   StuckOnEarth.
[01:57:25.880 --> 01:57:26.880]   StuckOnEarth.
[01:57:26.880 --> 01:57:27.880]   That's it.
[01:57:27.880 --> 01:57:28.880]   StuckOnEarth.
[01:57:28.880 --> 01:57:29.880]   The app.
[01:57:29.880 --> 01:57:31.880]   And then there's, of course, 100 cameras in one.
[01:57:31.880 --> 01:57:32.880]   100 cameras in one.
[01:57:32.880 --> 01:57:34.360]   You're leaving for New Zealand soon.
[01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:35.360]   Yeah.
[01:57:35.360 --> 01:57:37.000]   Like in about a month.
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:38.000]   Wow.
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:39.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:40.000]   Are we going to see you, Donald?
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:41.760]   I'm still on the internet.
[01:57:41.760 --> 01:57:43.400]   But I know, but are you going to come up here?
[01:57:43.400 --> 01:57:44.400]   Of course.
[01:57:44.400 --> 01:57:45.400]   So long flight.
[01:57:45.400 --> 01:57:46.400]   I'll come back a lot.
[01:57:46.400 --> 01:57:47.400]   I'm still using you.
[01:57:47.400 --> 01:57:48.400]   No.
[01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:49.400]   No.
[01:57:49.400 --> 01:57:50.400]   No.
[01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:51.400]   Okay.
[01:57:51.400 --> 01:57:52.400]   Well, give me a nose rub because that's what the Maori do.
[01:57:52.400 --> 01:57:53.400]   Oh, man.
[01:57:53.400 --> 01:57:54.400]   Oh.
[01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:56.400]   That is a first for Twitter.
[01:57:56.400 --> 01:57:57.400]   I don't think that's the-
[01:57:57.400 --> 01:57:58.400]   No, no, no.
[01:57:58.400 --> 01:57:59.400]   I'm beginning skeptical now, but-
[01:57:59.400 --> 01:58:01.920]   By the way, I didn't know this.
[01:58:01.920 --> 01:58:03.400]   You have an app for Google TV.
[01:58:03.400 --> 01:58:04.400]   Is that true?
[01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:05.520]   Yeah, we have an app on Google TV.
[01:58:05.520 --> 01:58:07.240]   What's that?
[01:58:07.240 --> 01:58:10.480]   It's called Photo Voyages with Trade Wrap.
[01:58:10.480 --> 01:58:12.480]   I didn't even know that I have a Google TV at all.
[01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:13.480]   Actually, I'm Roku.
[01:58:13.480 --> 01:58:14.480]   Oh, okay.
[01:58:14.480 --> 01:58:16.360]   Yeah, we've got- it just came out for iOS.
[01:58:16.360 --> 01:58:19.160]   It's all I have to look for.
[01:58:19.160 --> 01:58:20.160]   It's called again?
[01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:21.920]   It's called Photo Voyages.
[01:58:21.920 --> 01:58:22.920]   Photo Voyages.
[01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:26.360]   I'd also like to plug the No Agenda show.
[01:58:26.360 --> 01:58:28.360]   The man-
[01:58:28.360 --> 01:58:29.600]   Episode 400 was this week.
[01:58:29.600 --> 01:58:30.600]   Is that right?
[01:58:30.600 --> 01:58:31.760]   Are you going to have him on No Agenda?
[01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:33.000]   Do you have guests on No Agenda?
[01:58:33.000 --> 01:58:34.000]   Never.
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:35.000]   Never.
[01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:36.000]   It's just you and Adam.
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:37.000]   Think about the reasons.
[01:58:37.000 --> 01:58:38.000]   Yeah, essentially.
[01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:39.000]   Yeah.
[01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:40.840]   But it's like over the years, you know, I've done these shows.
[01:58:40.840 --> 01:58:42.040]   There's booking issues.
[01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:43.040]   People don't show up.
[01:58:43.040 --> 01:58:44.040]   No, it's so much easier.
[01:58:44.040 --> 01:58:45.040]   It's so much easier.
[01:58:45.040 --> 01:58:46.040]   Forget guests.
[01:58:46.040 --> 01:58:48.560]   The worst part is people pestering you about being a guest.
[01:58:48.560 --> 01:58:49.560]   I know.
[01:58:49.560 --> 01:58:50.560]   I hate that.
[01:58:50.560 --> 01:58:52.560]   I have this priest who keeps asking me if he-
[01:58:52.560 --> 01:58:53.560]   I know what he's saying.
[01:58:53.560 --> 01:58:54.560]   Weird, weird.
[01:58:54.560 --> 01:58:55.560]   Guys, show us up.
[01:58:55.560 --> 01:58:56.560]   He's in the chat room by you.
[01:58:56.560 --> 01:58:57.560]   Leo, Leo, Leo.
[01:58:57.560 --> 01:58:58.560]   It's another priest, not you.
[01:58:58.560 --> 01:58:59.560]   That's not you.
[01:58:59.560 --> 01:59:00.560]   It's that other guy.
[01:59:00.560 --> 01:59:02.800]   I want to tell you, this guy is the best.
[01:59:02.800 --> 01:59:03.800]   I agree.
[01:59:03.800 --> 01:59:04.800]   Trade like a fight.
[01:59:04.800 --> 01:59:05.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:59:05.800 --> 01:59:06.800]   The guy's unbelievable.
[01:59:06.800 --> 01:59:07.800]   I love trade.
[01:59:07.800 --> 01:59:08.800]   Everybody loves trade.
[01:59:08.800 --> 01:59:09.800]   It's the exchange for the plug.
[01:59:09.800 --> 01:59:10.800]   Oh, okay.
[01:59:10.800 --> 01:59:11.800]   It's a little vlog roll in here.
[01:59:11.800 --> 01:59:15.640]   Go on to show.com, channel devorec.com at the real devorec on Twitter.
[01:59:15.640 --> 01:59:18.040]   At the real devorec, I need some more people.
[01:59:18.040 --> 01:59:19.120]   You know what I'm thinking of doing?
[01:59:19.120 --> 01:59:20.120]   What are you thinking of doing?
[01:59:20.120 --> 01:59:23.840]   I'm thinking of getting- you know, there's this train museum in Sacramento.
[01:59:23.840 --> 01:59:24.840]   Yes.
[01:59:24.840 --> 01:59:29.440]   I'm thinking of doing a tweetup on the train to go to Sacramento to visit the train museum
[01:59:29.440 --> 01:59:30.440]   to take pictures.
[01:59:30.440 --> 01:59:31.440]   I'll go.
[01:59:31.440 --> 01:59:32.440]   And we'll just load up the train with people.
[01:59:32.440 --> 01:59:33.440]   They pick up, you know, all along.
[01:59:33.440 --> 01:59:35.080]   Has anybody ever done a photo walk on a train?
[01:59:35.080 --> 01:59:36.280]   Or could be a train walk?
[01:59:36.280 --> 01:59:40.760]   Yeah, you can get on the train anywhere from Santa's day all the way up to Sacramento and
[01:59:40.760 --> 01:59:41.760]   you do a tweetup.
[01:59:41.760 --> 01:59:43.760]   And then when you get there, you have a little event.
[01:59:43.760 --> 01:59:44.760]   Let's do it.
[01:59:44.760 --> 01:59:45.760]   I'll go with you.
[01:59:45.760 --> 01:59:46.760]   That'd be awesome.
[01:59:46.760 --> 01:59:47.760]   I'll double a number of people.
[01:59:47.760 --> 01:59:49.480]   Well, at least 30% more.
[01:59:49.480 --> 01:59:50.480]   No, probably double.
[01:59:50.480 --> 01:59:51.880]   And then you get Jolie to come.
[01:59:51.880 --> 01:59:54.280]   We'll pack them in, but you know she's not going to do it.
[01:59:54.280 --> 01:59:55.280]   Do what?
[01:59:55.280 --> 01:59:56.280]   Come on, would you write a train?
[01:59:56.280 --> 01:59:57.280]   Train's kind of 19th century.
[01:59:57.280 --> 01:59:58.920]   I've written trains before.
[01:59:58.920 --> 02:00:01.280]   They're kind of disgusting and slow.
[02:00:01.280 --> 02:00:02.840]   There you go.
[02:00:02.840 --> 02:00:03.840]   Wow.
[02:00:03.840 --> 02:00:06.760]   Sorry, I hate to rob you of your romantic illusions about trainings.
[02:00:06.760 --> 02:00:09.560]   The only thing that was bad is that when she said disgusting and slow, she like really
[02:00:09.560 --> 02:00:10.560]   looked at me.
[02:00:10.560 --> 02:00:11.560]   Yeah.
[02:00:11.560 --> 02:00:12.560]   Yeah, disgusting and slow.
[02:00:12.560 --> 02:00:13.560]   Yeah.
[02:00:13.560 --> 02:00:15.320]   She was looking back and forth between you two.
[02:00:15.320 --> 02:00:16.320]   Yeah.
[02:00:16.320 --> 02:00:17.320]   No, she was screaming and slow.
[02:00:17.320 --> 02:00:18.800]   She was staring right at Leo.
[02:00:18.800 --> 02:00:21.280]   I would like to thank you all for joining us.
[02:00:21.280 --> 02:00:22.280]   Invite you.
[02:00:22.280 --> 02:00:23.280]   Wait a minute.
[02:00:23.280 --> 02:00:24.280]   We can't go anywhere.
[02:00:24.280 --> 02:00:26.560]   Tom Merritt's here with a look at the week ahead.
[02:00:26.560 --> 02:00:27.560]   No way.

[02:00:42.440 --> 02:00:45.240]   copies and Yahoo and IBM have their earnings.

[02:01:13.520 --> 02:01:17.160]   All that more will be keeping an eye on on Tech News today next week.
[02:01:17.160 --> 02:01:18.160]   Back to you, Leo.
[02:01:18.160 --> 02:01:19.160]   Thank you, Tom Merritt.

[02:01:38.280 --> 02:01:39.280]   We talk.
[02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:42.320]   We're actually going to start using a new service called on the air to take calls and
[02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:43.560]   stuff if you'd like to do it.
[02:01:43.560 --> 02:01:44.560]   What?
[02:01:44.560 --> 02:01:45.560]   Yeah, I think it'd be kind of fun.
[02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:46.560]   What do you think?
[02:01:46.560 --> 02:01:47.560]   No?
[02:01:47.560 --> 02:01:48.560]   Anarchy.
[02:01:48.560 --> 02:01:49.560]   Yeah, maybe anarchy will ensue.
[02:01:49.560 --> 02:01:50.560]   I'm surprised you haven't done that before, actually.
[02:01:50.560 --> 02:01:51.800]   I've been wanting to do it.
[02:01:51.800 --> 02:01:53.400]   But the technology really wasn't there.
[02:01:53.400 --> 02:01:56.480]   Somebody's created a new thing that we used on last night.
[02:01:56.480 --> 02:01:57.560]   It worked great.
[02:01:57.560 --> 02:01:58.560]   That allowed us to take calls.
[02:01:58.560 --> 02:01:59.800]   So we're going to try and start doing that.
[02:01:59.800 --> 02:02:00.800]   How are the callers?
[02:02:00.800 --> 02:02:01.800]   Were they?
[02:02:01.800 --> 02:02:02.960]   Most of them were wearing pants.
[02:02:02.960 --> 02:02:03.960]   Most of them.
[02:02:03.960 --> 02:02:05.720]   Anyway, that'll be a lot of fun.
[02:02:05.720 --> 02:02:07.760]   And I hope you'll tune in, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:02:07.760 --> 02:02:08.760]   Thank you for joining us.

[02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:18.280]   9 AM.
[02:02:18.280 --> 02:02:19.280]   9 AM.
[02:02:19.280 --> 02:02:20.280]   9 AM Pacific.
[02:02:20.280 --> 02:02:21.280]   9 AM Pacific.

[02:02:33.620 --> 02:02:37.360]   Chat Show and a bunch of other people talking about the future of television.
[02:02:37.360 --> 02:02:38.760]   I think you'd be interested in this.
[02:02:38.760 --> 02:02:39.760]   Maybe.
[02:02:39.760 --> 02:02:40.760]   Yeah, it's going to be a lot of fun.

[02:02:57.800 --> 02:03:22.600]   and you can get a free pass to the NAB show with the word "twit" as a coupon code.

[02:03:30.440 --> 02:03:31.440]   This is amazing.
