[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech. We brought back one of our favorite
[00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.280]   panels from last year. Ed Bott is here from ZDNet, Christina Warren from Gizmodo
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.280]   to Vendra Harderwar from Engadget. We're going to talk about the right to
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.540]   repair. Apple says it's a terrible idea. I think it's a pretty good idea. We're
[00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.120]   going to take a look at the iPhone 8 and all of those fabulous rumors. Do you
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.760]   blame 4chan for the way the world is today? Some people think that's the
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.920]   problem. And Bill Gates says, "I got a solution, text the robots." It's all
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.400]   coming up next. On Twit.
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:40.800]   Netcast you love. From people you trust.

[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.400]   sorry did I yell at you? I did. I'm sorry. I'm a little excited. I'm a little
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.720]   ramped up because we got a great panel for you today. Joining me all the way on
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.360]   the left from Alamo Gorda, New Mexico. Home of the ET game cartridge. It's Ed
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.880]   Bot. No you're not from Alamo Gorda. Santa Fe. Close enough. Santa Fe.
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:44.560]   Turn left at Albuquerque. Hi Leo. Hey great to see you. Good to see you.
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:51.160]   Ed many for many years. One of the kind of the premier editors in Windows
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.800]   magazines mostly right PC magazine. No PC computing right? Yeah PC computing
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:02.080]   and before that PC world. Loved PC computing. Are you sad to see IDG? It looks
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.440]   like it's gonna be bought by a Chinese company. Well it sounds like it's a
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.320]   really good company that's that's buying them. So it sounds like it's one of the
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.720]   best outcomes of you know there wasn't a great outcome in all of this but it
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.560]   sounds like it's a pretty good one. Yeah I think so. Somebody told me it's really
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.160]   effectively was Chinese IDG. Right. So they understand the culture they want to
[00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.320]   preserve the culture that kind of thing. Yep. Great to have you also here from
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:39.040]   Mashable film girl Christina Warren. From Gismodo. Goddamn it. Can we
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.600]   start the show over? No I don't. I'm so sorry. You used to be a Mashable and I
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.840]   of course I knew you went to Gismodo that was months ago. Yeah I gotta keep
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.920]   track of this stuff. Good to see you and you're doing a lot of podcast for Gismodo
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.640]   which is awesome. Yeah yeah. Good. You want to plug them? Well I do a show on my
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.120]   own called Rocket on the relay FM and so people want to listen to me talking
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.360]   about tech me and Brianna Boo and Simone Droch for. Oh that's great show. I love
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:14.200]   that show. Thank you. Yeah I forgot about that. In fact that's that's kind of
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.960]   that's one of my go-to podcasts. Well thank you for being here Christina. I love
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.160]   to be here. Thanks for having me. And from Engadget I think you're still in
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:29.560]   Gagit. I am. Daven way harder work. Yes yes. Engadget.com great to have you. Thanks for
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:37.480]   having me. And do you talk on Rocket? Do you talk about space? Sometimes. Because
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:43.120]   SpaceX had a successful launch this morning. I love Elon Musk's tweet it was
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.040]   just a picture of the rocket going up. They delayed it yesterday and so
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.400]   everybody's going oh no and then they got it up and this is going to be another
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:56.240]   ISS supply mission I think. I don't know why I threw that in. Because a rocket
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:05.440]   got me in the mood. So what do you guys want to talk about? I don't know.
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:10.000]   I don't know. Whatever. Nebraska. Let's talk about Nebraska. How often do we talk
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.360]   about Nebraska on this show? Nebraska is one of I think six states that are
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:23.280]   looking at laws to give you the right to repair. Nebraska, New York, Tennessee,
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:29.640]   Wyoming, Minnesota, Kansas, Illinois and Massachusetts. The theory being you own a
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:34.240]   product like a John Deere tractor or an iPhone. You should have the right to fix
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:40.960]   it at any fix it shop you want including third party fix it shops. Apple does not
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:48.200]   like this among others. In fact they are now lobbying Nebraska lawmakers to kill
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:53.360]   the right to repair legislation saying unauthorized repair will turn the state
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.900]   into a mecca for hackers. I would be a great
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:05.380]   license plate for Nebraska Nebraska hacker mecca. I don't think Nebraska will
[00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:11.380]   ever be a mecca for hackers. But what is there some justify? Let me ask you
[00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:17.340]   Christina some justification for Apple not to want to get these laws passed. I
[00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.740]   think that their justification is that when you have unauthorized people
[00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.940]   performing repairs they can often do repairs that might not be of the quality
[00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:32.180]   that Apple would want their products to be living up to. So if they repair the
[00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:37.860]   phone your screen that's one thing but if they're doing other sorts of logic
[00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.880]   border pairs things like that there could be problems with the phone that
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:46.460]   Apple could be responsible for that Apple would reputation with some help
[00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:50.820]   you tied to. It actually happened right last year there was an iOS update that
[00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:57.300]   fixed the error 53 and it bricked iPhones that had been repaired at third party
[00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:01.820]   repair shops and Apple's rationale was well yeah because if you repaired it we
[00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:06.540]   don't know that touch ID the fingerprint reader is still gonna work properly and
[00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:10.540]   so we can't secure the phone. On the other hand Kyle Waines who's been a big
[00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:15.060]   advocate he's at iFixes of right to repair course iFixit which has been a
[00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:19.100]   sponsor on the show in the past makes manuals and sells parts to repair stuff
[00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:22.340]   says that the rationale that an independent mechanic ought to be able to
[00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:27.340]   bypass things like error 53 that are designed to prevent repair in other
[00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:32.580]   words he says Apple did error 53 to fair it out and put out a business third
[00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:41.220]   party repair companies. Apple's taken this seriously. I mean are we surprised
[00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:45.380]   right this is the company that that's all about sealed boxes and not tinkering
[00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:49.820]   really and we see there one computer that you know you could actually upgrade
[00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:55.380]   easily the Mac Pro is just like has been ignored for so long this makes a lot
[00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:59.300]   of sense for Apple the bigger problem now is the touch ID stuff right if you
[00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:02.500]   go get your screen or something fixed yeah they have to they have to make sure
[00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:06.500]   everything is in line and it's a lot tougher I guess if independent parties
[00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:15.180]   do that now. Well but caveat M. Tor that's and that's always been the case if you
[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:19.420]   want to have a cheap repair done and you want to you want to save some money
[00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:23.860]   you take the risk that it's not going to be of the quality that it would be if
[00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:29.220]   you went to an Apple store or an authorized repair shop but to preemptively
[00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:38.380]   say that it's illegal for someone or even even if I own it myself to buy to
[00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:44.100]   scavenge parts you know to go to a place like Swappa and buy a phone that's no
[00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:49.500]   longer functional and take it apart and and cannibalize it for parts and then
[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:53.900]   use those parts myself the point of a law like this would even prevent me from
[00:08:53.900 --> 00:09:00.100]   doing that which is nuts. Yeah I agree I mean my main issue would
[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:04.460]   error 53 happened and an Apple ended up issuing a software update that basically
[00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:09.980]   made error 53 no longer an issue my issue with that wasn't so much you know
[00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:13.860]   even that they said well look for the sanctity of touch ID and for other
[00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:18.700]   stuff we need to have repairs done a certain way that's all well and good to
[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:21.820]   say well if you want this to work you need to go to an authorized repair
[00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:26.820]   center but to your point at A to say you can't do this at all and it should be
[00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:30.220]   illegal that's insane but the secondary problem is that when you're outside of
[00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:34.620]   the United States or major cities in other parts of the world going to an
[00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:39.700]   authorized repair center is often difficult if not impossible so if you're
[00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:43.140]   you know what one of the error 53 cases that the Guardian had written about when
[00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:49.060]   that issue broke came out was you know a journalist who was in a part of the
[00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:52.620]   world where there were not Apple stores and he needed to get his phone repaired
[00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:57.380]   and it had very important information on it and you know then his phone is
[00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:02.220]   bricked and so the issue for me isn't so much that they say we would prefer
[00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:07.500]   people to have their phones you know repaired by authorized places or
[00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:10.340]   Apple stores it's that there are plenty of parts of the world where that's not a
[00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:14.780]   possibility and so I think this sort of legislation has the potential to be
[00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:19.860]   dangerous if it were to to gain acceptance because Apple stores are in
[00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:23.740]   most cities in the United States but they're not everywhere and I don't want
[00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:28.020]   to be in a situation where I need to have my phone repaired and I can't get
[00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:32.660]   anything done because I'm four hours away from an Apple store the story
[00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:37.460]   this story comes from Jason Koehler running at writing at motherboard he
[00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:41.980]   says that he learned about it from Nebraska State Senator Lydia Brash who
[00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:47.260]   was visited by an Apple State government affairs specialist what the guy didn't
[00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:51.300]   know apparently is that not only is a brash a farmer so she you know is very
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:55.420]   aware of the John Deere issue she also works remotely for a software company
[00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:59.660]   Atlanta has a background in computer science she said I think they were
[00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:05.620]   surprised to learn that I know what they were talking about she also said a lot
[00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:09.660]   of times with Apple there's almost always two interpretations one apples and
[00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:12.860]   this is a perfect example acting in the best interests of its customers to
[00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:16.020]   protect their security to protect the integrity of the phone the other apples
[00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:20.820]   acting in the best interest of its profits and in in this case you could it
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:25.220]   could be either way this might lean you in one direction because apparently
[00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:30.980]   Apple also said just take the phone part out of the bill and will go away they
[00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:36.820]   don't care about John Deere who also wouldn't like people to you know John
[00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:40.380]   Deere is afraid people are gonna pirate there's softer in their farm
[00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:44.940]   equipment brash said it's tempting but we need to repair consumer technology to
[00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:49.940]   the story they're telling is we need to be afraid of technology she says you
[00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:52.900]   don't have to be afraid of technology you have to be afraid of the people who
[00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:58.260]   are trying to prevent you from knowing the things you know are these companies
[00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.860]   in it for the greater good or the greater dollar good Cohen senator
[00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:06.740]   brash wow seriously yeah when we talk to Kyle Wiens one of the things he said is
[00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:10.620]   only one state needs to pass this there eight considering it he said the best
[00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:15.460]   one probably be Massachusetts the reason is if any state passes it all the manuals
[00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:19.140]   all the parts have to start to be sold in that state that means it's accessible
[00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:26.020]   to anybody in the US so if one state passes it it's as good as done I mean I can
[00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:30.020]   understand the concern too because Apple I refurbished iPhones has become a bigger
[00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:34.020]   business for them you know they've been in India that's how they're gonna that's
[00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:37.500]   how they're gonna get into the Indian market for sure and if you have all these
[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.660]   third-party repairs happening and you don't know the quality of the repair or
[00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:43.980]   something you know that phone is inherently less valuable understand
[00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:47.900]   those sides really yeah yeah there is that and honestly the hacker issue it
[00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:50.820]   maybe sound a little overblown but you don't know what somebody's doing with
[00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:53.740]   your device when they take it to back room you know and start picking it apart
[00:12:53.740 --> 00:12:56.900]   and a lot of the times you have to unlock your phone or give them certain
[00:12:56.900 --> 00:13:01.580]   access to it as well they may not even need that but people they may tell
[00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:07.220]   somebody that they do so yeah there's a certain value in making sure all the
[00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:09.620]   Apple people are doing it but we don't know if they're trustworthy either right
[00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:14.340]   so it's tough that's this particular part might be moot with the next iPhone
[00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:19.380]   because Apple has patented a on-screen fingerprint reader mm-hmm as a
[00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:23.340]   put it's gonna be the same it's gonna be the same deal right the whole it's the
[00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:28.380]   secure element and tying that to the actual whatever is reading the fingerprint
[00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:31.580]   that's I just had to get my screen replaced and they have to do a whole
[00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:35.100]   thing to make sure that that was all connected with the new touch ID SAMSUN
[00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:38.700]   does that too with Knox right if you if you if you might if you attempt to
[00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:43.740]   modify or root a SAMSUN phone they have a special counter and as soon as it's
[00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:48.220]   been rooted Knox and all that whole secure stuff just turns off right which
[00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:51.260]   I think is a better way to handle it I think isn't that how Apple eventually
[00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:57.020]   handled error 53 yes that's what they wound up doing and which is which I think
[00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:00.900]   it's acceptable what's not acceptable is breaking someone's phone completely
[00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:05.060]   when they might not have had a choice and how the repair was done but yeah I
[00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:09.140]   mean I think the divindress point I mean it even though it might seem silly you
[00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:12.260]   can conceive of if someone were to come up with some sort of ex-boyder make some
[00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:16.300]   sort of hardware modification to your phone or install something you know at
[00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:20.900]   that level that's a kind of a scary prospect of then taking your phone to
[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:25.660]   SAMUN authorized dealer and now that's that's allowed because you have right
[00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:30.060]   to repair and telling the difference between the phones for me I think that
[00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.660]   would be the big consumer issue is how do you know that this refurbished phone
[00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:37.060]   has gone through the same steps as this refurbished phone right now you know if
[00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:41.300]   you buy one from Apple or if you buy one from some of the various you know places
[00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:44.980]   you know it's gone through different different levels and and have used
[00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:52.460]   official parts I wouldn't want to buy a phone that had you know a battery made
[00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:56.580]   by someone that might not be able to spec or had you know a screen or even a
[00:14:56.580 --> 00:15:02.820]   home button that wasn't as good who knows so I see both sides but I think
[00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:08.620]   that saying that you don't have the right to repair your technology no matter
[00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:12.540]   what your rationale is is a dangerous thing to say and obviously you're going
[00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:15.540]   to get pushed back from from a lot of people including you know the center
[00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:19.540]   Dervan Braska who as as you were guys were pointing out is very well informed
[00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:24.300]   on this issue yeah it seems kind of pointless to even fight the law to
[00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:27.660]   right because the devices are getting more and more integrated it's gonna be
[00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:32.340]   tougher yeah just to even like replace individual components and that's
[00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:36.020]   something we can't really stop and we can't really legislate against I guess
[00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:39.060]   but that's what's gonna happen is the iPhone gets thinner and you know all
[00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:42.580]   the components just become one piece of the logic board or something I fix it
[00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:45.860]   just gave the AirPods I think the it may not be the first time but one of the
[00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:50.740]   first zero zero repair abilities because it's just there's is glue throughout the
[00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:55.940]   entire body yeah so yeah you can't yeah I mean on a hundred fifty dollar
[00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:59.500]   pair of headphones I guess that's okay I mean honestly I think that's completely
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:04.540]   fine I mean the the replacement cost is you know seventy dollars per air pod or
[00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:07.940]   you know it's about the same as by it's slightly less than buying a new pair I'm
[00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:11.420]   completely fine with that I mean if it to make things that small would it be
[00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:14.540]   nice if you could do more self repairs I mean sure of course it would be nice
[00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:19.300]   but got a thing about here's an insurance other stuff from my own
[00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:24.340]   experience I had a Mac book this is many years ago and before the magsafe
[00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:28.860]   adapter you know the the power cord had gotten pulled out and it bent and
[00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:33.060]   actually broke the connection of the power cord to the motherboard brought it
[00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:36.780]   to Apple they say well the way we fix that is we replace the whole motherboard
[00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:42.660]   that'll be a thousand dollars brought it to when this place existed the an
[00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:46.780]   independent Mac store in San Francisco Mac Adam and the guys said yeah we see
[00:16:46.780 --> 00:16:54.900]   this all the time I just solder it back back on it $15 and I it was really glad
[00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:57.580]   that Mac Adam existed and the guy understood and was able to fix it that
[00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:00.820]   quickly because I don't want to buy a new logic board but that's kind of so
[00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:03.740]   that's why you should have the right to repair and by the way I think you do
[00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:08.740]   have the right to repair computers yes yeah I think so and I somebody in in a
[00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:12.460]   on the chat was pointing out this is really about making third-party
[00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:15.420]   repair manuals or making that the repair manuals available to their
[00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:21.180]   party and parts manuals are yeah Apple does not and by the way tools they have
[00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:25.580]   special purpose built machines in the back to disassemble for instance you
[00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:29.500]   know you can't disassemble an iPhone would just take a screwdriver to it so
[00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:32.620]   they have all these special purpose I understand I've never been back there
[00:17:32.620 --> 00:17:38.060]   but they have special tools back their special machines even mm-hmm yeah it's
[00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:40.900]   not just about those third-party repair people too it's the competition
[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:44.620]   right Apple is always about keeping its trade secret so close to the best I'm
[00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:48.020]   sure Samsung and LG and everybody has spent a lot of time to some link these
[00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:51.220]   phones but if they had the exact manuals to you know that'd be a little
[00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:55.340]   different and I apologize to everybody outside the United States for
[00:17:55.340 --> 00:18:01.500]   pronouncing solder solder with the only so there's a couple of things we do
[00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:09.540]   really well here in the United States the we do a Fahrenheit we don't do the
[00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:14.780]   metric system we do feet we do in the imperial system we don't do single pair
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:19.980]   health care and we pronounce solder solder wrong we're good at all three of
[00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:23.660]   those I didn't know okay this just shows my ignorance I didn't know that it
[00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:27.060]   wasn't pronounced solder outside of the United States I didn't either until I
[00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:32.660]   started doing podcasts and then I sure heard about it to our couple from Perth
[00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:38.060]   I'm saying it wrong aren't I yeah it's sold her it's also a router not a router
[00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:44.380]   right but we're getting something different in Australia yes and don't
[00:18:44.380 --> 00:18:50.700]   ever wear a fanny pack in Great Britain but that's another story in time you
[00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:54.100]   know more than a third of our audience is outside the US I really ought to start
[00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:57.540]   I'm I've already started saying Z at instead of Z because actually that's
[00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:03.420]   makes sense yeah yeah but solder I can't get you sold her sounds like something's
[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:08.980]   wrong solder and I know if I do that that all the Americans would say why are
[00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:16.220]   you saying it wrong well I was on my schedule actually we'll talk I let's take
[00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:23.100]   a break and then I want to talk about Sid Bikonavar who's a JPL scientist US
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:31.260]   citizen who had his phone taken away by the customs and border patrol and
[00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:36.340]   and data sucked and and what this raise what issue this raises and what you
[00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:40.180]   would recommend if you're going to travel outside the United States with
[00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:42.820]   electronics we talked about I was talking about on the radio show and I'd
[00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:47.340]   like to hear what you guys think Devindra Hardowar is here from Engadget from
[00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:52.140]   Gizmodo film girl Christina why can't call you film girl anymore can I sure
[00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:55.580]   you can can I why not that's your Twitter handle film under school I'll

[00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:14.980]   zd net zd net yeah do you ever say z z z I can't say zd net that sounds weird
[00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:22.100]   yes because because zd net is a global organization we have staff in in
[00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:30.780]   Australia the UK Singapore South Korea and so z is actually what the majority
[00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:38.500]   of CD net staffers say wow so yeah it comes up regularly that's cool so I
[00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:42.740]   feel I feel like I'm very you know I'm a very futuristic I'm a global guy when I
[00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:48.940]   say zd and solder I never could say solders that sounds wrong our show today
[00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:52.300]   brought to you by FreshBooks the ridiculously easy cloud accounting
[00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:57.420]   software I discovered at first 12 years ago when I was a freelancer flying up to
[00:20:57.420 --> 00:21:02.860]   Vancouver or actually was Toronto to do a call for help up there and you know as
[00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:05.980]   many freelancers at the end of every month I had a sit down and I it was the
[00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:11.780]   worst thing I hate it if you think you hate paying bills I make craning bills is
[00:21:11.780 --> 00:21:15.500]   just as bad invoicing people you know it's a you got to sit down with I with
[00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:19.780]   word or excel it was either billman Canadian dollars or change the
[00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:23.820]   currencies I you know I had to figure out my expenses were so I could you know

[00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:29.740]   sometimes I just put it off and and of course would I learned quickly is you
[00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:33.340]   don't invoice you don't get paid it was Amber MacArthur who told me about a

[00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:58.340]   their support this weekend tech did you see this story in fact I was just on
[00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:02.980]   Snopes and Snopes says whether because of the way security services work we
[00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:08.700]   can't really verify this story but I feel like it I think it's true Sid
[00:24:08.700 --> 00:24:17.100]   Bikonavar is a scientist at JPL the Jet Propulsion Lab he's US born he's a
[00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:21.420]   citizen he's a NASA engineer traveling with a valid US passport he was in
[00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:26.580]   South America for car racing because he does that when he got trying to get back
[00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:33.620]   in early this month he was detained by Homeland Security he was stuck in a room
[00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:37.420]   where people were sleeping on cots people stranded under the Muslim ban they
[00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:41.540]   seized his phone and wouldn't give it to him until he gave him access for the
[00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:46.900]   pin now he said this wasn't even my phone it was a JPL issued phone and he
[00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:54.260]   had been instructed to keep it secure but they also told him the CPB told him if
[00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:56.620]   you don't give us the phone you're gonna be sitting here for a while we do have
[00:24:56.620 --> 00:25:01.380]   cots so you can rest so he said all right I'll give you the phone in the pin he
[00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:06.340]   said half an hour later they came back with the phone after having copied his
[00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:09.500]   data he says I'm but now this is his Facebook post and the reason he posted
[00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:13.300]   is I am I'm removing my Facebook page I'm removing my social media accounts
[00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:17.220]   it's like know what they got and what they want they have passwords they have
[00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:21.460]   everything and he's been he gave his phone to the JPL to run forensics on it
[00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:25.700]   that they were apparently fairly upset about it and he's working with legal
[00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:32.580]   counsel JPL so this important this has been the case for some time but I think
[00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:36.580]   it's ramped up when you enter the United States whether you're a citizen or not
[00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:41.020]   they can go through your bags right but the issue is can they also go through
[00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:46.060]   your electronics and lately the opinion has been of the CPB and of federal
[00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:50.100]   officials that they can they have the right to look at your computer the right
[00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:56.260]   to look at your phone my I guess my advice and my what my practice will be
[00:25:56.260 --> 00:26:00.540]   is it enough to just turn off everything before we reenter the U.S. because I'm
[00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:05.180]   gonna be traveling this year Ed what do you think Ed you're muted I think turn
[00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:10.820]   it off yeah there you go now you're back oh I was the PI maybe that was us
[00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:15.180]   sometimes I mute I think so because I don't recall meeting and and anyway
[00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:21.820]   probably the border protection folks did that to me no what I want to let Ed
[00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:31.460]   speak if I had sensitive data on my on my computer first of all it would be
[00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:37.500]   encrypted and I wouldn't give up the password for that for any kind of
[00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:41.860]   social media apps if I were in a situation where I felt I were at risk of
[00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:46.180]   being searched and having that information inspected at the border I
[00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:51.620]   would delete the app and wipe out the cash on my phone wow before I re-entered
[00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:56.140]   wow because at that point at that point there's nothing they can do and it's
[00:26:56.140 --> 00:27:02.500]   trivially easy once you get back into a place where you feel safe to reinstall
[00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:08.380]   the app or go to a different device enter your password do the 2FA and and
[00:27:08.380 --> 00:27:14.820]   and and and there you are but but no I would I would literally for social media
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:20.980]   in particular it's the simplest and best solution is to simply delete those
[00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:25.540]   apps and wipe the cash well and I think social media is a good example because
[00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:30.020]   it's it's often would lend itself to and we've seen this before to misinterpretation
[00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:35.580]   people say jokey things that could be misinterpreted but the worst thing the
[00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:42.340]   worst thing is that it is a social graph and so as a result they are finding
[00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:47.780]   your friends you and your friends your whole self friends friends friends and
[00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:54.660]   and yes and so if if you know somebody who knows somebody you know you have a
[00:27:54.660 --> 00:28:00.740]   perfectly innocent friend who has a perfectly guilty friend then you know
[00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:06.020]   you're you're guilt by association it's the you know it's six degrees of of
[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:11.980]   Kevin Bacon and and that's just you know for some people especially you know
[00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:19.820]   for for journalists investigative reporters scientists anybody who you know
[00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:25.140]   is in a is in a vulnerable position right now deleting when I went to China a
[00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:29.980]   few years ago I did not the yes occupation and I was counseled not to say
[00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:36.460]   journalist but to say teacher or educator which I didn't feel was a lie but now
[00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:39.140]   I'm gonna do the same thing coming in the United States and I feel like that's
[00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:48.260]   sad I sh this guy is a US citizen US born but I guess because he has a name
[00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:52.580]   with a lot of consonants I was a random search Leo nothing nothing nothing
[00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:57.220]   nothing no is a little darker than you and me but maybe not you yeah you're gonna
[00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:01.340]   I wouldn't if I were you I've noticed random to vendor I would not leave the
[00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:06.700]   town I would stay in Brooklyn seriously are you concerned do you travel
[00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:12.660]   internationally like I've I travel internationally for work sometimes so I
[00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:16.340]   have a Computex coming up so that's who knows what's gonna happen between the
[00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:22.260]   US and Taiwan you know until then but it's all it's all kind of scary and
[00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:27.900]   especially yeah as somebody I'm not Muslim either but I do feel like the the
[00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:31.940]   effect of the Muslim ban would definitely make people treat me differently
[00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:36.340]   and that's why the story kind of worries me your advice is really good at about
[00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:40.660]   deleting social apps but that doesn't like your your social content will still
[00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:44.460]   be out there so it wouldn't be that hard for them to find who you are if
[00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:48.180]   you're posting publicly and you know link you up to people and the bigger
[00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:51.860]   problem is the data that's actually on your device there's not much you can do
[00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:55.940]   about it sort of just completely deleting it not keeping any data on your device
[00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:58.620]   that you don't want you know a government agency to see even if you
[00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:02.700]   encrypt it like if you're yeah the NSA isn't gonna get involved for most
[00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:06.500]   people but yeah we have ways of cracking that stuff now - and they're right not to
[00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:09.740]   be there at all your rights are different so this so in the past we've
[00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:13.940]   always said well they may be conforged you to do a fingerprint unlock
[00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:18.980]   because think you know courts have held over the years that a strand of hair for
[00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:24.860]   DNA or a fingerprint when they book you for an arrest isn't self-incriminating
[00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:31.140]   testimony that's that's just information that but it isn't incriminating and a
[00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:35.660]   password or anything that's in your mind the police don't have the right to that
[00:30:35.660 --> 00:30:41.060]   because of the Fifth Amendment and the right against self-incrimination so but
[00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:45.700]   note that might be different coming over the border that the border patrol
[00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:50.340]   people and the EFF is waiting on this and say you know technically the ACLU said
[00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:56.060]   if you're asked for your pin or password call us but who you want to come home
[00:30:56.060 --> 00:31:00.620]   yeah you don't want to be spending the next few days in detainment at an
[00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:08.940]   airport airport jail cannot be good and I can see why Vickanavar and almost
[00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:13.460]   anybody else would say well fine just take the pin Rory Sellen Jones who writes
[00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:16.580]   for the BBC for rights about technology and Brock has about technology really
[00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:20.980]   great guy asked the British Embassy what their advice would be if you're going
[00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:27.220]   into the United States actually I'm sorry the US Embassy in London all
[00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:31.780]   international travelers arriving to the US by the way apparently all all American
[00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:35.620]   travelers as well are subject to US Customs and Border Protection inspection
[00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:39.340]   this inspection may include electronic devices computers disk strives tapes
[00:31:39.340 --> 00:31:44.100]   mobile phones other communications devices cameras music and other music
[00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:47.580]   why do they want my music music and other media players and any other
[00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:51.060]   electronic or digital devices keeping America safe and enforcing our nation's
[00:31:51.060 --> 00:31:54.260]   law in an increasingly digital world depends on our ability to lawfully
[00:31:54.260 --> 00:32:01.180]   examine all materials entering the United States so assume that you will
[00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:07.220]   that you're subject to this and colleague this makes me sad that yeah this
[00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:12.740]   happen and the reason is I you know I think that to some people your luck
[00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:17.740]   searching your luggage and searching your digital devices is equivalent
[00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:21.700]   should it be isn't isn't your digital device this is really the debate this
[00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:25.980]   goes back to San Bernardino and the pin number and FBI wanting access to that
[00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:30.580]   phone it feels to me like a phone has more of your personal stuff in it than
[00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:35.620]   your suitcase mm-hmm for sure there should definitely be different like a
[00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:38.940]   differentiation I'm still a doing that they have the right to just search through
[00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:43.580]   suitcases I've definitely lost cameras and other things I've simply left in my
[00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:50.700]   carry-ons yeah because they can just open them up and take whatever yeah you
[00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:57.100]   - oh yeah yeah no I lost a camera that I was dumb enough to not yeah take on as a
[00:32:57.100 --> 00:33:01.260]   carry-on I thought oh it'll be fine it'll be fine no it wasn't it was it was
[00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:05.380]   taken it could be just I mean somebody else cuz those are yeah those are run of
[00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:11.140]   the mill luggage thieves there was a ring working in Newark Airport that finally
[00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:15.660]   got busted a year ago I would hope that law enforcement would be doing that yeah
[00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:20.620]   I don't know I don't know I remember reports of the Homeland Security people
[00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:25.860]   yeah being tied to stuff like this too and it's or the TSA and I certainly I
[00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:29.140]   feel invaded if they want to go through my music if they want to go through my
[00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:33.620]   my social accounts and they've said this we reserve the right to ask you for the
[00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:37.620]   passwords to your social media accounts yeah I mean there've been some people
[00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:40.500]   who have suggested and I don't know how tenable this is this is the difficult
[00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:42.740]   thing but I mean some people have suggested that depending on what you do
[00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:46.380]   and what line of work you're in taking a burner phone if you're leaving the
[00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:51.340]   country right and and depending on what type of work you do that actually might
[00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:55.580]   not be a bad idea because if the information is really sensitive then you
[00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:59.780]   don't want to have any of your accounts on there because I know that for me I'm
[00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:03.020]   obviously not involved in anything illegal I'm not doing anything that would
[00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:07.180]   be going against what the you know what our agents would want but if they were
[00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:09.820]   to go through my social media profiles go through other stuff and you see
[00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:13.540]   something that you've made as you were saying Leo something makes a joke or
[00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:17.660]   someone on your timeline makes a joke that it could be interpreted the wrong
[00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:20.980]   way or makes a political statement it's well within their rights to make that's
[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:25.260]   interpreted the wrong way you know you could people could be detained or
[00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:29.100]   questions to be asked and in that that's kind of a scary place to be I'm very
[00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:34.460]   fortunate that I have a lot of privilege having you know a last name and a
[00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:38.380]   skin color that might preclude me from some of these things but that doesn't
[00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:43.140]   mean that it's it's not a real problem and that I'm not concerned as a
[00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:49.180]   journalist at this state in time you know leaving when things are the way that
[00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:55.220]   they are mm-hmm I guess what really scares me about all this too is like as soon as
[00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:59.620]   the travel ban was announced we started hearing reports of you know people being
[00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:05.060]   detained at JFK families children being detained for hours with no food and no
[00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:09.140]   real way to get to their you know their relatives who are here my worry is that
[00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:14.260]   we have all these you know just normal civil workers people who are just doing
[00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:19.340]   their job but at you know the stroke of Donald Trump's pen they become willing
[00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:23.140]   participants in his like vision of fascism and that's kind of how it begins
[00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:26.340]   right it's just people doing their job somebody doing their job they take your
[00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:30.620]   phone somebody doing their job to detain you here sort of tearing some creeps up
[00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:37.780]   yeah slowly it's terrifying yeah yeah all right mm-hmm there's an uplifting
[00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:44.380]   topic um hmm but an important one no I think so a really important one and I
[00:35:44.380 --> 00:35:51.580]   think there's we are seeing a lot of interest in this from the ACLU from the
[00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:57.900]   electronic frontier foundation from other organizations that are going to be
[00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:05.740]   pushing hard and and speaking up very very loudly about these issues because
[00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:13.820]   it's just not what the United States of America is supposed to be about and
[00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:18.460]   and you know so you got to push back on stuff like this and to your point about
[00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:24.300]   it being inconvenient to be to be stuck in an airport you know I appreciate
[00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:29.860]   that on the other hand I appreciate the fact that there are people whose names
[00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:39.220]   are attached to landmark court decisions who did more than just
[00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:46.260]   inconvenience themselves they put themselves in harm's way and and spent
[00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:52.580]   years fighting back so that so that they could establish these principles so
[00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:59.060]   if somebody wants to do that to me you know great let it be you know bought
[00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:04.180]   versus the United States well you're following good for you all right yeah I
[00:37:04.180 --> 00:37:10.020]   mean I'm gonna let's let's put it this way ain't nobody gonna get my pin or my
[00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:15.380]   passwords at the border period full stop and and by the way the ACLU says it is
[00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:21.940]   illegal for law enforcement officers to discriminate on any you know political
[00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:24.380]   beliefs race religion but law enforcement of the airports and border
[00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:27.140]   generally have the authorities search all bags and ask you questions about
[00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:31.140]   your citizenship and travel itinerary but they have asserted and you know it's
[00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:34.140]   unclear but they've asserted they do not have the right to ask you for your pin
[00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:42.460]   and you can legally refuse them without risking yeah court or or jail time on
[00:37:42.460 --> 00:37:45.980]   the other hand they also may detain you longer they may make it in in
[00:37:45.980 --> 00:37:48.660]   convenient or uncomfortable for you well I've got three international trips
[00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:53.860]   planned this year so I do two of them are safe I think two of them one South
[00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:59.340]   America once France but once to Cuba and I'm actually very nervous about coming
[00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:04.420]   back from Cuba oh boy yeah I think maybe not bring any electronics to Cuba it
[00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:08.900]   won't work they don't have any internet anyway so right it's probably safe to
[00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:15.260]   to do that then I think like the the best outcome I've seen from all this and
[00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:19.220]   kind of a hellfire we're living through right now is is like the immune response
[00:38:19.220 --> 00:38:24.220]   system that's just kind of left up you know of US democracy like the protests
[00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:28.100]   have happened people are fighting back so like I'm glad you said what you did
[00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:30.940]   add because I think if this stuff continues to happen people will fight
[00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:38.060]   back and we will see like some resistance to all of this this so if you I don't
[00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:43.580]   know if you know who Dale Barron is he is a comic artist he does high quality
[00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:48.060]   precision comics at Dale Barron and wrote a medium post this morning actually on
[00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:53.420]   Valentine's Day that's been starting to be passed around saying this is our all
[00:38:53.420 --> 00:39:01.340]   our fault because because of 4chan and all of us have been around long enough
[00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:08.300]   to have watched the rise of 4chan and it's his opinion that that the the what's
[00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:13.180]   happening in America right now is the logical conclusion of all of this I'm
[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:16.660]   not sure I fully agree I think that there is a group of people who are in it
[00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:21.140]   for the lulls that's the 4chan people I don't I think there's more than that
[00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:26.700]   there there are a lot of reasons why this is going on but it's a very
[00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:33.460]   interesting read and I think it's worth it's worth reading it's on medium and he
[00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:38.780]   says you know he he was an early for 4chan user and back before 4chan a
[00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:43.540]   form I remember called something awful and of course Pepe the frog is a 4chan
[00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:49.860]   meme and it's it's really interesting there's definitely like a philosophical
[00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:53.900]   through line that you can build from 4chan through like game or gate and then
[00:39:53.900 --> 00:40:00.260]   to everything that's happened this year yeah yeah and so in some ways I I
[00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:03.180]   often wonder this you remember when we had the debates and which we all
[00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:10.940]   roundly disagreed with that you know all of these kids playing violent video
[00:40:10.940 --> 00:40:16.660]   games that there was gonna be some social consequence to a whole generation
[00:40:16.660 --> 00:40:23.860]   raised you know in front of a screen and so forth and I wonder in some ways if
[00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:27.500]   that maybe maybe there is a consequence maybe just took a long time to come out
[00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:32.860]   well it wasn't the violent video games it was the people who didn't really like
[00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:36.660]   have friends and found friends online but that's where these guys came from right
[00:40:36.660 --> 00:40:40.540]   they kind of yeah not everybody look I played violent video games we all
[00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:48.100]   probably did but but a certain percentage of people became very anti-social and
[00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:52.780]   and and a culture was created I think that you can't disagree that that there
[00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:58.820]   was a culture created and and that's created I know it's really politically
[00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:04.380]   incorrect to say this but I kind of feel like that's what happened well I
[00:41:04.380 --> 00:41:08.380]   mean there are separate things right there is the culture there's you know
[00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:12.620]   gamer culture in general and there are like subsections of that and I don't I
[00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:15.980]   don't know if I blame the games themselves it could be anything could be
[00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:19.900]   any sort of game like this no but I don't know please don't get that I don't
[00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:23.780]   I don't know I'm not blaming the game but I'm blaming this kind of isolated
[00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:32.100]   culture so yes kids in the last 20 years have had the opportunity just to
[00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:38.340]   kind of not go outside not even in it relate to people in real life IRL but
[00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:42.100]   instead relate to people on the internet relate to people through forums and
[00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:48.220]   gaming and and become you know I feel like it fostered a kind of
[00:41:48.220 --> 00:41:55.660]   lonerism that is as it turns out could be destructive not only to the person
[00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:59.620]   but to the rest of the world I think trolling is a result of it I think
[00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:03.820]   trolling is a direct outcome of this and the for the lows and the and a lot of
[00:42:03.820 --> 00:42:09.980]   this and I I maybe it's I want you to talk me out of it maybe I'm not an old
[00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:14.940]   man now and it's just you kids you see I told you you shouldn't you should get
[00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:19.620]   out to fresh it go get some fresh air I told you except I'm not just the kids
[00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:24.620]   yeah well me too I spent kids and I don't think it's just the lack of fresh
[00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:27.220]   hair I think part of it is they're not kids anymore they're your guys age
[00:42:27.220 --> 00:42:32.180]   right right but but I also think that part of it is that there became like
[00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:35.980]   social currency and I mean real social currency in pop culture in other places
[00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:42.620]   where acting you know like a troll would would lead to a certain amount of
[00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:48.540]   popularity and fame and attention so you know like there's there there are
[00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:51.980]   whole television networks and shows and and and real entertainment they're kind
[00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:56.460]   of built on these same sorts of shows TV's just as much to blame and so I mean
[00:42:56.460 --> 00:43:01.140]   honestly I would say that I mean if there's any blame at all to be said I don't
[00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:05.220]   know I think it's not the right to certain ways blame is a mistake but the
[00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:10.100]   but just to see the consequence or the causality perhaps it just I think that
[00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:16.020]   there's there's been a a pattern of rewarding certain types of behavior for
[00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:22.680]   a long time financially with attention with fame with my
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:28.520]   adolescents I was a loner I played chess you know I did all the had I had the
[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:32.600]   opportunity to sit in my basement playing games and had we had the
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:39.000]   Internet I I'm sure I would have been at any social you know I would have
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.840]   because you know I'm shy and introspective and I would have just become that person
[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:46.680]   I didn't have that opportunity thank God I remember in high school
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:53.160]   thermonuclear war yeah yeah I would that's my generation in high school you know I
[00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:57.920]   had that same kind of snarky and I knew others that had that same kind of screw
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:03.880]   it all make fun of establishment mentality that jokey mentality but I
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:08.880]   couldn't I couldn't weaponize it because it was just a few of us and there was no
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:12.480]   way to talk to everybody else who was doing that but now it's been I think it
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:17.440]   got weaponized by the Internet yeah it's totally the Internet though not just
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:22.480]   games but go ahead and great two things number one this is not a new topic there
[00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:26.360]   was a book written a couple years ago called bowling alone the collapse and
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:31.320]   revival of American community that addressed this exact topic and it isn't
[00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:42.360]   just online services and in chat rooms and communities and such it's it's society
[00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:46.920]   across the board yeah yeah it's your generation told you you're the stranger
[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:51.720]   janger generation you can't go outside you'll get kidnapped and mutilated so
[00:44:51.720 --> 00:45:01.560]   there was no there was a whole book that was there was written about that and
[00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:05.960]   it's a it's a very very good book and and worth reading but I think the second
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:11.760]   thing that's maybe more important is that our our social media networks have
[00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:18.440]   made the same mistake that the Internet made in its early days it was designed
[00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:24.080]   optimistically nobody that so the Internet was designed assuming that
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:30.400]   people were good and benign assuming that actors that and and and so instead
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:38.960]   of so Twitter for example was you know nobody ever thought nobody at Twitter
[00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:45.200]   you know ever thought jack and ab in those guys never thought that Nazis
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:51.760]   would take over Twitter if you had told them that in 2007 when you know the
[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:56.240]   first tweet said just setting up my Twitter well I'll tell you I think they're
[00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:59.640]   more sophisticated I think they knew that there was a there were people that
[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:04.880]   would do that but and I's did I and and you know they were the free speech wing
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:09.280]   of the free speech party right absolute free speech but I thought and I bet
[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:14.320]   they thought that the sunlight would disinfect that this that that's a good
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:19.480]   thing let that is the mistake but that's the mistake the mistake has always been
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:27.520]   that a bad speech a small amount of bad speech can always drown out good speech
[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:32.960]   that's why that's why you don't read the comments because the number we've learned
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:38.000]   that lesson have a way holy yeah you know but but I mean that and most of these
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:47.160]   systems were were never designed in in such a way that they could resist the
[00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:55.960]   cancer of of of these you know of hate speech and and malicious and actors with
[00:46:55.960 --> 00:47:01.280]   malicious intent and as a and because these things were designed mostly to
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:08.960]   make money and to grow big quickly without without any concept of how to
[00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:14.560]   grow big safely and securely for the entire community that's how you got
[00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:21.440]   viruses for PCs that's how you got spam taking over entire email servers and
[00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:26.440]   that's how you have Nazis taking over Twitter I don't fake news taking over
[00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:29.200]   Facebook the interesting thing is I think a lot of these aren't really Nazi I
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:34.720]   watched and boy it was painful Milo Yiannopoulos on Bill Maher this week it was
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:38.920]   really painful but he's the guy who was banned on Twitter because he used his
[00:47:38.920 --> 00:47:43.400]   real name and he said I'm not doing you know he's one of those people I might
[00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:47.400]   have been that kind of person I'm not doing anything wrong I'm just having fun
[00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:51.640]   unlike that he obviously likes the intention I don't think you I think it's
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:55.920]   possible probably doesn't believe anything he's saying but he masked an
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:59.840]   army of people on Twitter and the reason was banned not because of the things he
[00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:03.200]   said but because the things he said incited whole groups of people to go
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:08.640]   after other people you was very adept at manipulating a mob on Twitter in effect
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:12.640]   and I watched him and I think that a lot of these people are like him I don't
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:18.080]   know if they're not ideologically Nazis they're probably not even ideologically
[00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:22.560]   racist they're in it for the lulz it doesn't matter I agree it doesn't matter
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:27.040]   yeah it doesn't matter but this is so this PewDiePie stories is related right
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:30.360]   because PewDiePie of course we've talked about this a little bit but he was banned
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:34.280]   in fact I got a number of tweets last week after talking about it saying you
[00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:40.960]   misunderstood this entirely PewDiePie was banned from he had a deal with
[00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:45.040]   maker studios part of Disney and well actually let me tell you that what
[00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:48.640]   happened and then and then we'll take a break because Aussie geek girl in the
[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:54.200]   chat room has to go to the bathroom but as soon as I go through this so what
[00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:58.120]   PewDiePie says he did is there's a service called Fiverr two hours you have
[00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:02.960]   somebody five dollars they do stuff and he thought well it'd be fun if he just
[00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:08.080]   tried it and paid five bucks to get somebody to say death to Jews and a couple
[00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:13.800]   of guys in India took the money PewDiePie then and this is all on the video and
[00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:17.800]   you can't see it has been taken down professed shock in dismay that Fiverr
[00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:20.440]   would a allow him to do that and be that somebody would take the five bucks
[00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:24.760]   and do it oh my god I'm shocked and this is kind of what PewDiePie does is this
[00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:31.840]   kind of this is this is how you get 53 million subscribers on YouTube and but
[00:49:31.840 --> 00:49:35.680]   you can't but he crossed a line obviously and this kind of anti-Semitism
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:40.160]   will not stand Disney dropped him even YouTube didn't they didn't kill his
[00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:44.760]   channels notice now but they said well you can't be part of the other special
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:48.760]   kids who get special advertising deals you just continue generating ad revenue
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:53.960]   over there yeah but I think this is another example of this kind of culture
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:50:04.200]   where oh look what I did and the question is is is it okay is is say is and I think
[00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:08.520]   so the the mean doesn't tweets I got were you don't understand PewDiePie this
[00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:11.760]   is he's mocking he's showing showing holding up a mirror to culture and
[00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:17.040]   mocking the culture and sense of humor it's funny right and I remember when I
[00:50:17.040 --> 00:50:23.400]   was 16 doing kind of not that bad but doing snarky funny kind of sarcastic
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:27.800]   anti-establishment stuff but it's been weaponized now right PewDiePie did it
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:33.240]   for an audience of 53 million people on YouTube yep and you did it in your
[00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:36.600]   friends you did it in my friends and we have any kind of knew the context and
[00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:41.400]   that that was it and I shouldn't do it for a teacher or a parent well I mean I
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:46.600]   think people have made the the kind of the the comparison said why is what PewDiePie
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:50.640]   did not okay and what you know South Park and it's always funny and so in
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:55.920]   Philadelphia and other programs do you why is that okay good question I mean and
[00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:59.960]   I think that's a fair question Ben could share at Polycon wrote I thought that
[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:03.360]   his response is pretty good to that he was like well they're funny and PewDiePie
[00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:09.000]   is big biggest sin but that's but is that a crime not being funny well I mean I
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.640]   think that if you're going to actually try to shed a light on it you know a
[00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:16.200]   social mirror or a construct of these sorts of things you have to do with a
[00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:19.840]   certain amount of nuance and you have to do it with with a certain deafness that
[00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:24.280]   he didn't have obviously having said that even if he had been very very
[00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:27.960]   funny and very skilled in the way he did it I still think that there would have
[00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:32.880]   been backlash and I mean that's fair both things are fair to me I think that he
[00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:37.760]   has the right to make videos that say whatever he wants to say and and whether
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:40.600]   his jokes are funny or not if his audience enjoys them even if they don't
[00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:44.240]   enjoy them he has the right to make those videos by the same token you know
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:47.840]   advertisers and companies like the Walt Disney Company have the right to say we
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:51.280]   don't want to be associated with this sort of content both things to me are
[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:55.320]   completely fair what you can continue making his videos advertisers can't
[00:51:55.320 --> 00:52:00.560]   can say we will or we won't allow advertising with you one of the things
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:06.920]   Dale Barron says in this article is that 4chan defined itself by being
[00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:11.840]   insensitive to suffering in a way that only people who have never really
[00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:18.040]   suffered can yes that is to say young people mostly young men protected by a
[00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:25.120]   cloak of anonymity that's kind of it isn't it that it's a death of empathy as a
[00:52:25.120 --> 00:52:29.240]   culture you know I was I was at snarky teenager - I think every teenager is a
[00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:34.000]   yeah we all we all know any better you've ever yeah we rebel against what came
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:37.080]   before that's how culture moves forward you know that's just the way it works
[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:41.680]   but I feel like we've spent so much in this conversation Leo so I just want to
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:45.880]   quickly say like the bigger problem for me isn't that you know it started with
[00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:49.080]   all these kids just being at home alone and you know not allowed to go outside
[00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:53.440]   but it is the power of communication and what the internet enabled you could
[00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:57.280]   look at talk radio you could look at so many things reality TV you know what
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:53:01.920]   people watch and do extends far beyond the internet but the internet became the
[00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:07.200]   tool for rallying together so yeah I my early time of the internet I spent a
[00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:10.680]   lot of time chatting with people about video games and anime and stuff like
[00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:14.000]   that and now you go and look at kind of the subcultures are forming around
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:18.240]   some things it's gross it's disgusting because of kind of what the internet has
[00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:22.640]   become and how widespread it's become so yeah that's it's a problem of
[00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:26.600]   communication and my big worry is yeah this loss of empathy well and this is a
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:31.720]   conversation that was probably being held in some quarters in 1938 the rat
[00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:38.000]   the rise of mass media enabled Joseph Gebels and Adolf Hitler to seduce and
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:43.240]   sway a German populace it was the first use of mass media for very much the same
[00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:50.680]   thing and films so oftentimes new technologies offer new opportunities and
[00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:54.560]   there's I think there's never been a more powerful technology than the
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:54:00.920]   internet and but ad you said this is the inevitable consequence can we can we
[00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:06.760]   get past this well I didn't say it's the inevitable consequence I said it's
[00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:13.400]   something that needs to be taken into account during the design process for
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:19.720]   any kind of system like this I don't know you know I mean I certainly Twitter
[00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:25.480]   there's there's a million things that Twitter could be doing and they're doing
[00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:31.440]   and and they're doing one or two maybe and you know you say oh I don't think
[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:36.080]   these people are literally Nazis but you know what if somebody if and I know
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:42.160]   people and mostly they're women who whose Twitter feeds have been polluted
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:49.240]   oh yeah with pictures of it's horrible of you know Holocaust scenes and and
[00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:53.760]   them being pushed into other you work with Jana Wu Christina I mean I do you know
[00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:58.880]   this intimately absolutely stop not non-stop and so there comes a point she
[00:54:58.880 --> 00:55:02.560]   was you know maybe out of her home you like you asked the question you know
[00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:06.320]   you asked the question what's the test well the the Supreme Court actually came
[00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:14.880]   up with the test it in Miller versus California the test was serious let's
[00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:20.480]   see if it's utterly without socially redeeming value then it's pornography
[00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:26.440]   if it if it lacks serious literary artistic political or scientific value
[00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:33.760]   those are you know I mean I could look at at PewDiePie is there is there any
[00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:38.920]   redeeming social value and the work that he did is there any serious literary
[00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:43.080]   artistic political or scientific value there perhaps let someone make the case
[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:49.600]   for you like but you know what some random Twitter account with a Pepe the
[00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:58.720]   frog beam attached to it that is spewing pictures of Auschwitz to people with
[00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:04.680]   Jewish last names there's you know I I think Twitter ought to be canceling those
[00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:09.240]   accounts and making sure that the people behind those accounts don't recreate
[00:56:09.240 --> 00:56:14.080]   them you know it doesn't seem they say they're doing that although I haven't
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:18.720]   seen any evidence of that yeah that is a harder problem right canceling killing
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:22.440]   accounts is easy but making sure that you know people can create fake emails
[00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:27.160]   pretty easily like that's what is getting VPNs and hide their traces so I
[00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:32.360]   mean if if somebody decides to be anonymous on Twitter it's fairly trivial
[00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:36.080]   to do that maybe phone verification could be a thing like because they'd have
[00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:39.920]   Institute they'd have to do some sort of verification exactly yeah but there's
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:46.040]   still burner phones right I mean there yeah but at that point you have
[00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:50.720]   eliminated the problem that we have right now is that there are literally
[00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:58.000]   programs that are that are troll generators they create boss and I and you
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:03.720]   know with with one T and and those accounts those automated accounts can
[00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:08.160]   just go out and spew hatred far and white well guess what if you if you
[00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:15.080]   create some sort of validation process for them you have kneecapped the the
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:20.960]   industry that creates those automated hate generating systems but but you
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:26.600]   know Twitter Twitter is it is in trouble economically their revenue has
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:31.640]   declined for what now 14 street quarters or something like that and for them to
[00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:36.800]   do that would be for them to admit that the majority the vast majority of
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:43.160]   accounts that have been created are not real and and you then you'd get you'd
[00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:46.600]   get back to the point where you could see you know what Twitter really is and
[00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:51.880]   and you know they'd economically collapse yeah and so it's so for economic
[00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:56.480]   reasons for the same reason that PewDiePie is still allowed to have his stuff
[00:57:56.480 --> 00:58:01.880]   up there and have advertising revenue created to it you know generated from it
[00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:05.120]   you know it's the same thing as long as people are making money from it they're
[00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:09.360]   going to have a hard time doing the right thing basically all YouTube all
[00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:12.680]   Google said to PewDiePie's well just for that we're gonna take more of your
[00:58:12.680 --> 00:58:25.040]   revenue that's the punishment Wow all right you know I also I understand that
[00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:32.440]   maybe I don't understand fully what is you know I come from white privilege
[00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:37.640]   right so I'm not gonna suffer and of course it's the ultimate white privilege
[00:58:37.640 --> 00:58:42.600]   to say oh this is just joking it's you know kids being kids no harms meant
[00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:50.360]   it's not a Muslim ban because I don't have to worry about it so I'm trying I
[00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:56.160]   it's very I am challenged and I bet you many of us are challenged about how to
[00:58:56.160 --> 00:59:00.280]   think about this what it really means where we're headed what what is the
[00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:04.920]   upshot of this I really thought the internet was gonna be a voice for
[00:59:04.920 --> 00:59:10.680]   everybody the ultimate democratization it was going to it was going to liberate
[00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:18.520]   the world and it's very sad if this is the final result that's I I can't accept
[00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:23.920]   that this got to be a way forward I wouldn't say this is the final result but
[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:28.960]   this is a result right this is the it's a result of many things to its response
[00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:33.240]   to you know having Barack Obama is present for eight years to like that's
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:38.160]   led to a lot of a lot of resentment a lot of pushback in other ways in politics
[00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:41.360]   and that kind of led to Trump is well there's a lot more going on I agree yeah
[00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:45.720]   we're stepping through you know these stages as a society that the internet
[00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:49.160]   now is the greatest communication device we've ever had what I've always loved
[00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:52.800]   about Twitter is that it's sort of like that to me it's like the matrix timeline
[00:59:52.800 --> 00:59:56.160]   of what's going on in the world right it's just like looking down seeing code
[00:59:56.160 --> 01:00:00.520]   and like seeing what's happening in the world and that's there's good and bad to
[01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:03.680]   that and we have to figure out how to move beyond that but I also think we kind
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:07.360]   of have to yeah get a little more enlightened as a culture to do that you
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:11.000]   know it's really interesting to me is that despite the fact that none of this
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:14.080]   could be foreseen two hundred sixty years ago hell we didn't foresee it ten
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:20.440]   years ago that nevertheless the fundamental truths of the Constitution
[01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:32.000]   seem to work I feel like the Constitution has some deep kind of profound value
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.680]   ethical truths in it and if we could exercise them we might make it at least
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:40.000]   the polity might make it that this country might make it that doesn't have
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.920]   anything to do with our culture or how people will be yeah but and where it
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:48.520]   didn't work we we spent a lot of time you know amending it yeah fixing things
[01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:52.760]   so that's yeah that that's I actually just rewatched Steven Spielberg's Lincoln
[01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:58.800]   last night yeah I had to feel a little good about you know this this land of
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:02.480]   America and that movie I love that movie it's a really strange thing because it's
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:05.160]   like a play but I love that movie when I first saw it watching it now though
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:09.480]   seeing people fight for you know the 13th Amendment it's kind of heartbreaking
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:14.480]   it's like this though it's been so through much of American history that was
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:17.240]   you know what I've been reading a lot of history books for the same reason
[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:21.360]   because I'm trying to understand is this a unique moment in history or just is
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:28.280]   this just a very and it is a very common cycle in this American experiment we've
[01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:32.160]   been going through this for 260 years have you read the biography of Andrew
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:37.000]   Jackson Wow John John Meacham's biography of Andrew Jackson I have to
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:42.240]   read I've been doing a lot of reading of Andrew Jackson because he's considered a
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:45.440]   populist president much in the mold of Trump and Trump has a big portrait of
[01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:50.520]   Jackson on the wall next to his desk in the Oval Office yeah well he was he was
[01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:57.440]   a an interesting character and probably probably misunderstood but a better
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:02:02.400]   reason to read the biography is not so much to understand him but to understand
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:11.000]   the times and how and how that was that was 25 years before or 35 years before
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:18.000]   the Civil War started but it all of the pieces were in place for it to have
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.880]   for it to have started in and it was it was inevitable yeah of unfortunately
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:27.640]   after it's a great book the worth worth reading read that all right let's take a
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:34.280]   break let's have some snacks we get our blood sugar up and we will continue on

[01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:36.000]   this serious stuff and I deep stuff and you guys are so smart I I almost feel
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:41.560]   bad saying and what about those iPhone 8 rumors it's a little hard to write
[01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:46.360]   about phone rumors yeah yeah
[01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:53.440]   do we want to talk about those but but and and what happens though is you know
[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:57.840]   these things become like you say this is more important than everything else
[01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:03.200]   and you get people you know somebody on Twitter just called us all douchebags
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:10.080]   because he says you know he says well that those TSA regulations are from 2014
[01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:15.760]   so don't blame Trump I didn't blame even mention Trump no I think you know
[01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:20.280]   yeah so but but that's how that's how sensitive people are yeah but you know
[01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:25.040]   what if somebody had asked for my the passwords to my social media accounts at
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:33.160]   at a border entry in 2014 or 2012 or 2010 I would have said no then too but
[01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:38.600]   but you know what it's only coming up now right right it you know it's been
[01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:44.280]   coming and we have to we did talk we did talk about that by the way in 2014 and
[01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:47.920]   it's been coming there was there was some concern about that we did so we've
[01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:51.760]   seen this coming and by the way there's nothing wrong with a douchebag it's a
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:56.080]   lovely device for cleaning yourself and I'm I'm clean as a whistle so there you
[01:06:56.080 --> 01:07:05.680]   go it's a form of lavage it's lavage douche means shower in French so what is
[01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:10.320]   this tweet of yours I don't understand you better explain to me compare the
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:15.440]   screenshot with the user profile well okay you have to you have to so you have
[01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:20.800]   to look at that entire that entire thread here go go actually go back up
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:25.200]   go back up all right the top this by the way one of the things I'm always
[01:07:25.200 --> 01:07:30.840]   confused about Twitter which direction is up yes right with most recent one so
[01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:39.120]   Apple is has launched a new ad campaign for the iPad Pro yeah and they're quoting
[01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:45.160]   tweets from PC users now you think you think Republicans and Democrats are
[01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:50.920]   vicious fight but don't man you get PC users tweeting about iPads you got a
[01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:57.600]   problem so you look at this guy and and so they so they they quote his tweet
[01:07:57.600 --> 01:08:02.560]   it's Jeremy he says an iPad Pro is not even close to being a computer okay so
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:08.800]   now you can scroll down because here's Jeremy and that's actually Jeremy on the
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:16.800]   right wait a minute so Jeremy on the right the guy who really NASCAR kid yeah
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:21.600]   he's a white guy a redhead white guy from from the University of Alabama and
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:28.080]   that's probably yeah and they replaced him they replaced him with this guy with
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:33.600]   a nice a nice African American so now scroll down to the next one is this a
[01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:37.960]   pattern yes they did for ads oh they went the other way they went the other
[01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:44.640]   way well what they did was to replace these people who are all kind of you
[01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:49.960]   know normal normal Americans but also edgy and they replaced them with people
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:54.400]   who look like they work in an Apple store they probably do right so and they
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:59.680]   so hey who did the original tweet is Hispanic a YouTuber singer fitness and
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:05.160]   student beauty enthusiast but apparently this is somebody spends a lot of time in
[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:10.680]   her bedroom concerned about spiders I don't know I just thought you know I
[01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:13.840]   thought the whole thing was weird I thought the whole thing was very funny if
[01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:18.640]   you're gonna use a gapify be users yeah gapify they've been gapified that's
[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:22.600]   exactly and but you know being the larger issue is that they're trying to
[01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:30.760]   they're trying to capture the same lightning in a bottle that they got back
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:37.280]   in switch 2007 just to the long and with the John Hodgman yep with the Mac
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:41.880]   versus PC had had campaign but at least in that one you know they were creating
[01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:47.720]   characters you know and they were writing scripts and all the there's a I
[01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:54.960]   don't by the way I don't understand why does this is an Apple ad so why is Apple
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:59.800]   running tweets that are knocking the iPad I don't because because I think the
[01:09:59.800 --> 01:10:03.440]   concept of the ad is that people will say oh I can't do this stuff and then
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:09.320]   they will actually use oh I see so these people oh so each so each one is it so
[01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:14.120]   each one is a is is some sort of complaint from a PC user and then the
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:18.200]   ad and then they let them use an iPad and then they and then they say look look
[01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:23.160]   at how great you know look at how the iPad Pro will solve your will serve you
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:26.840]   solve your problem you know Microsoft's done ads like this - right I mean this is
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:30.440]   yeah and if you scroll a little further down in that thread I'll say if
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:35.000]   Microsoft had done this kind of ad campaign oh Lord they would have been
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:40.960]   crucified oh she is scared she's scared of viruses is what she was scared of
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:46.800]   what's what's what's uh let's see let's see what this guy Jeremy the NASCAR
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:52.000]   enthusiast he says my iPad Pro is even close to being a computer and then they
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:58.960]   give him a keyboard and a pencil and they do email footage look at and then he's
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:05.480]   happy right it's not a computer it's better hey you know what are you gonna
[01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:11.520]   do ads or ads right well right but I thought this was I this is I found this
[01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:21.280]   doesn't reach the level of Gmail man or the or the Internet Explorer 8 in
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:28.480]   private browsing ads which were you know frightening those were those were truly
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:32.960]   truly awful but but no I thought there were two things about this ad campaign
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:38.200]   that struck me as as weird first of all Apple's been going back and forth about
[01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:42.600]   you know the iPad Pro is a is a PC it's not a PC it is now they're saying it's
[01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:48.160]   better than a PC it's a PC plus plus well I mean they they definitely wanted to
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:52.040]   go against a Chromebook that's in a lower and oh is that where they're
[01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:54.360]   that where they're I mean you know actually Microsoft's doing the same thing
[01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:58.600]   they have a new version of a win what is it the cloud version of Windows
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:04.880]   version yeah yeah I mean I think both of those yeah but but the iPad but they're
[01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:10.120]   they're doing this with the iPad Pro you you for the for the activities that
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:13.880]   they're talking about here you cannot get an iPad Pro configured the way that
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:18.000]   they have them here for under a thousand dollars so if they're trying to go up
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:24.200]   against that Chromebooks and and cheap PCs this is I mean this is kind of so
[01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:28.120]   that's that's the part here to me that's a really weird disconnect because
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:33.520]   they're selling a thousand dollar plus device you can get it you can you can
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:42.320]   Tarte an iPad Pro up to about 1600 bucks I think and and that's not a Chromebook
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:46.400]   yeah so that's the one thing and and the other thing that I just thought was
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:53.640]   weird was to do this thing I mean if you're gonna do PC users complaining about
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:13:01.080]   PCs either use the real people or or you know get Justin Long and and and John
[01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:07.240]   Hodgman well sorry I cut you off what were you gonna say
[01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:12.840]   oh I was I cut Christine off yeah oh no I was just saying that they're they're
[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:16.600]   clearly aiming this at at the at the Chromebook and at lower end Windows
[01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:19.800]   machines now whether that's a fair price comparison or not is another
[01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:23.280]   situation but that's clearly how they're targeting the iPad Pro and I think
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:28.080]   that's that's one of the ways they're trying to kind of change the idea of what
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:32.120]   an iPad was you know from kind of being you know a tablet which at this point
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:36.280]   has become for you know everything that's not an iPad a very inexpensive kind of
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:39.760]   secondary computing device to being able to say actually you can do real work on
[01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:43.560]   these things and I have an iPad Pro and I love it and I think it's a it's a very
[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:49.240]   good tablet and I think that depending on what apps you use ironically I think
[01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:53.640]   the Microsoft apps are some of the best apps that really show off the iPad
[01:13:53.640 --> 01:13:58.120]   Pro but yeah I mean it's it's difficult for them they're they're in a weird
[01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:04.440]   spot because the MacBook starts at what like $1,400 the MacBook Pro rather you
[01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:10.000]   know you've got the MacBook which starts at $1,300 so or $1,200 so you're you're
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:16.080]   in a spot where this kind of is they're they're less expensive option so even
[01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:21.400]   though Zephyr in the chat rooms got it she says marketers have gotten so clever
[01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:27.840]   I'm completely confused that's that's really the final upshot of all of this I
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:30.720]   don't know and I hear I talk to people all the time on the radio show I don't
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:36.240]   know what to get seriously for the problem right yeah yeah Apple in
[01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:40.480]   particular has lost their marketing mojo right really you think so all the
[01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:44.960]   ads right now I think so they're not even from one of the first iPhone at yeah
[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:49.280]   that one's nice but compared like to the earlier iPhone ads and the iPod ads like
[01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:54.240]   I remember seeing the first commercials for the iPhone 7 and it was so weird and
[01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:58.960]   dark and fetishistic like it was like a David Fincher commercial for like you
[01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:02.840]   know a very dark movie like look at this all black iPhone isn't this amazing
[01:15:02.840 --> 01:15:06.280]   there's nothing there was no fun about it there wasn't anything about how this
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:09.440]   would make your life better it was more like look at this awesome model is a
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:13.040]   little bit thing and I don't know if they can get their messaging back maybe
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:20.680]   they need better ad people in general I'm I just got the Samsung Chromebook
[01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:25.120]   plus and the pros coming out in a couple of months these are the first and
[01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:31.040]   Dell's doing it now in a sus mid-range not super cheap but not pixel expensive
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:36.880]   Chromebooks right and I'm starting to wonder really if a tablet is the right
[01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:41.840]   choice for a lot of people that for a student I don't think a tablet of any
[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:45.600]   kind is the right choice when you can compare it to a Chromebook a four hundred
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:52.200]   fifty dollar Chromebook with touch with a pen convertible with the Android store
[01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:56.560]   and Chrome OS that's a pretty compelling choice for four hundred fifty dollars
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:16:01.800]   yeah I use that that's that's a good it's a good Chromebook and it I think
[01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:04.080]   you're right I think it is very compelling and that's a difficult
[01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:07.760]   position then to be in to say okay well what is your app story or what is your
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:12.840]   experience story on either either an iPad Pro or on a Windows machine that
[01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:18.240]   makes this better then then what you do here yeah I mean I think the iPad is a
[01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:23.840]   great words with friends machine but I would I mean I see we have a lot of the
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:28.320]   journalists who come on including Harry MacRack and use iPad pros as their main
[01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:34.080]   machine and I just feel I'm seeing more people do it yeah I don't think I would
[01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:37.680]   be able to do it but I do think that with the the keyboards that the new iPad
[01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:42.720]   pros I have the 9.7 I'd the other one is you know the the big 13 inches too big
[01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:48.720]   it's a very powerful machine and I think word on the iPad is fantastic and you
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:51.840]   can do a lot of stuff with that and this split-screen stuff does work very
[01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:55.080]   well and some of the creative apps from people that I've talked to who are more
[01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:58.000]   creative than I am or at least have better drawing skills than I do really
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:02.400]   like things with the Apple pencil and can do a lot of work on it but I don't
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:06.480]   know if it's if you I don't think I'd be more productive on an iPad than I would
[01:17:06.480 --> 01:17:12.360]   be on a computer whether it was it was Windows or a Mac but I do think that you
[01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:16.320]   can be a lot more productive than you might initially expect which might just
[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:20.520]   be the point of these ads which from I mean you know in fairness to Apple I
[01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:23.760]   think that this is strictly a YouTube campaign I don't think that these are
[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:27.280]   actually going to be area on television that doesn't necessarily you know make
[01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:31.560]   them any better but I think it puts them in a slightly different qualitative
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:37.400]   thing in the you know Apple marketing I guess hierarchy of YouTube ads are a
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:42.760]   little bit less than television ads do you think that Apple might have painted
[01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:48.600]   itself into a corner because they they don't I mean their cycles are you know
[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:55.280]   a year they don't have a huge range of products they've kind of really doubled
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:18:02.080]   down on certain kind of pathways and and on the PC side and on the Chromebook
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:06.920]   side you're seeing much more vibrant ecosystems much faster cycles
[01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:12.000]   Android phones you know I look at something like this Surface Studio this
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:17.920]   Microsoft you know touch hybrid thing it's probably a limited market but the
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:23.360]   fact is there's much more choice out there and I feel like in the long run
[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:28.280]   Apple's almost a mono culture and it's gonna hurt it in the long run because
[01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:32.800]   they can't throw things against the wall in the way that the chrome in the book
[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:36.920]   industry the Android industry the Windows industry can do is that does that make
[01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:40.920]   sense what do you think to them yeah I think it's apples in a really strange
[01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:44.880]   place right because they've been so innovative for so long with the iPhone
[01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:49.040]   the iPad that's all worked out really well for them and it feels like things
[01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:52.960]   have been really kind of static for the past couple years you know the biggest
[01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:55.680]   thing they've announced was the Apple Watch and they didn't even quite know
[01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:59.320]   what to do with that it was almost inevitable right the success of the
[01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:02.640]   iPhone the worst thing they can happen to a company is a massive success like
[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:06.120]   the iPhone yeah it's the innovation the innovators dilemma I think there's a
[01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:11.160]   name for that but yeah in these cases like this like Apple has in the past
[01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:14.800]   just kind of killed its starlings you know when the iPhone came out we knew
[01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:19.520]   that was gonna kill the iPod when the iPhone came out and that ended up
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:23.200]   happening eventually but Apple could do that as a company but now they've gotten
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:28.960]   so like they're they've been living off of iPhone profits for so long and that's
[01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:32.840]   been so good for them I don't know what they could do that would be hugely
[01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:36.520]   transformative moving forward and even basic things too like the Apple TV I
[01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:39.920]   think they finally started doing some stuff with it but they're still no cave
[01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:44.240]   4k version yet there's still a lot of that hasn't fully lived up to its
[01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:49.440]   potential either so they're in a weird spot right now and yeah just look at that
[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:52.360]   last batch of Mac books they weren't that interesting yet their stock is at a
[01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:55.600]   record high the company's the most valuable company in the world their
[01:19:55.600 --> 01:20:00.640]   profits are through the roof they sold 75 million iPhones last quarter it's not
[01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:04.920]   like a failing company but I just know that's the problem though when you're
[01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:08.960]   when you have all those successes it makes it harder to take chances and to
[01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:14.320]   be more nimble because you have so much more at stake this article from Bloomberg
[01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:19.900]   Alex Webb and Alex Sherman writing Apple struggles to make big deals
[01:20:19.900 --> 01:20:24.280]   hampering strategy shifts I have a big problem with that article yeah okay good
[01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:30.120]   so let's talk because I had never heard this particular point of view so what
[01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:32.960]   so tell me what your prop what does the article say and what are your problems
[01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:35.800]   the article is basically saying that they don't make enough big deals and that
[01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:40.240]   they should be working with more M&A advisors and and big banks to acquire
[01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:43.360]   big companies and then they need to make they need to buy Netflix basically
[01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:46.360]   that's what the article is saying they need to buy Netflix because that's the
[01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:48.960]   only way they're going to be innovative in the fact that they have
[01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:52.920]   historically beats was the biggest acquisition at three billion dollars you
[01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:57.280]   know most of their acquisitions have been under 500 million you know they make
[01:20:57.280 --> 01:21:01.560]   mostly smaller acquisitions that's a problem and that's holding them back I
[01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:07.240]   think that that thesis in and on its face is untrue I mean you can make
[01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:12.000]   arguments that maybe they should be as a company making bigger strategic bets
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:16.280]   in other ways but I don't think for instance that Apple spending 19 billion
[01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:20.280]   dollars on WhatsApp the way that Facebook did would have been any way
[01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:23.360]   open them up to a newer market or would have helped them in any conceivable way
[01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:26.480]   I don't think that Apple you know making some of the acquisitions that some other
[01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:30.920]   companies do would change anything buying Netflix a that's not possible if
[01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:35.000]   that was possible but it been years ago but it's not a possibility they would
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:38.100]   have to do do I think they should spend their entire cash reserves to buy
[01:21:38.100 --> 01:21:42.960]   Netflix because they want to get into video no I mean I think that that's
[01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:47.240]   that that makes very little sense if you wanted to talk about you know buying
[01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:51.560]   the Walt Disney company or buying you know time Warner which was apparently
[01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:54.880]   something they discussed at one point that might might make more sense if they
[01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:58.640]   were trying to do that but I think that the argument that the article is
[01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:02.120]   making is that the reason that they're they're not as innovative is because
[01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:04.920]   they're not making enough big enough acquisitions and I just I don't think
[01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:09.680]   that's the case at all I think I would if you could show me one acquisition that
[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:13.480]   they missed out on that would have ended up paying huge dividends for them
[01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:17.400]   that and if you could also show me conceivable proof the reason they didn't
[01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:20.960]   get that acquisition was because they weren't willing to pay that might be one
[01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:24.800]   thing but as it stands I mean I think John Gruber did a pretty decent analysis
[01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:30.080]   of this - you know this was a lot of of M&A people complaining that Apple
[01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:34.880]   doesn't do enough well but it was also I mean I think the revelation of it was
[01:22:34.880 --> 01:22:39.600]   that Apple is arrogant when it comes to market they don't they don't work with
[01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:45.120]   investment bankers they dictate terms they say take it or leave it and this
[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:49.560]   is how you make deals they have the money I mean you're not wrong but again I
[01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:52.760]   mean I would feel a lot better about this that supposition if you could show me
[01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:56.920]   what's a big deal they lost out on what should they buy right because again
[01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:59.960]   you look at the big acquisitions that Google and Facebook have made and even
[01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:02.360]   some of the ones that the Microsoft has made you know Microsoft made a great
[01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:05.960]   acquisition of LinkedIn you know $25 billion or whatever it was or was it
[01:23:05.960 --> 01:23:10.680]   more than that that made sense for Microsoft strategically that would not
[01:23:10.680 --> 01:23:15.840]   make sense for Apple strategically so you know other than other than in I mean
[01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:19.400]   I look at that and I see as investment makers upset that they're not let into
[01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:23.800]   an F deal flow and also investors who are mad that Apple didn't buy Netflix and
[01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:27.680]   it's like it's like sour grapes yeah yeah Netflix isn't gonna sell anyway like
[01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:31.960]   Netflix is not gonna sell like I don't in a way that the article tanks itself
[01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:36.680]   because after they show the graph of the big deal famines and how little money
[01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:40.880]   Apple spent and they say right in clever instead of closing big deals cook has so
[01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:44.400]   far focused on growing Apple service businesses including Apple music the
[01:23:44.400 --> 01:23:48.760]   app store and iCloud that's beginning to work with the company recently
[01:23:48.760 --> 01:23:52.360]   forecasting annual revenue of 50 billion dollars they made $23 billion
[01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:58.000]   last quarter alone on services so gee this has been a terrible strategy
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:04.900]   just well yeah sorry for reading this article basically you know basically
[01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:14.520]   Apple is in the position now that Microsoft was in in around 2006 they were
[01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:19.080]   you know the cloud stuff was taking off but nobody could really see it yeah
[01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:23.400]   they were a dominant monopoly in desktop software and operating systems and they
[01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:30.440]   were minting money and they were using that to build another business another
[01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:36.360]   cloud business and diversify themselves and and so what you have right now with
[01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:41.720]   Microsoft is a company that has you know 10 or 12 different businesses that are
[01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:46.560]   each worth you know several billion dollars in revenue per quarter you know
[01:24:46.560 --> 01:24:50.640]   that's I mean that's really well seven or eight that are worth at least a
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:54.160]   billion dollars per quarter and collect and several of them that are worth much
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:58.480]   more than that and as a result you know they've managed to be successful even
[01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:05.360]   when many people had written them off Apple is Apple can coast on the kind of
[01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:09.640]   growth scenarios that you just described things like services for for another
[01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:14.000]   10 years continuing to grow in a way that would be healthy for any other
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:17.360]   company except for the fact that they're the largest corporation in the world
[01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:24.960]   and and they need to find you know they need to diversify because at some
[01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:31.040]   point the iPhone is going to become the next iPod and and you know it like you
[01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:34.840]   said you know with the with the innovators dilemma there they you know
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:39.440]   they need to find another hit in there but you know but when you get you know
[01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:45.000]   Bloomberg and and other publications they are writing for investors they are
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.960]   writing for people who are buying stocks they're they're not writing for the
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:51.600]   people who buy the products and they're not writing for the people who make the
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:56.160]   products they do have a you know so that the point about making deals is just
[01:25:56.160 --> 01:26:00.440]   well that's traditionally the way that smaller companies get larger but Apple
[01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:06.040]   I mean they're so huge really there's there there's almost no companies that
[01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:09.440]   you can think of that they could buy that would allow them to actually grow
[01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:13.680]   although maybe some good options would be the companies that they've consistently
[01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:16.800]   fail to make deals with right like so the time Warner thing kind of made sense
[01:26:16.800 --> 01:26:20.840]   we've been hearing them having a lot of trouble trying to form deals with cable
[01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:25.480]   networks for some sort of like over-the-top Apple TV you know content
[01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:29.240]   distribution there so that's where I think it'd be good as we're pointing out
[01:26:29.240 --> 01:26:32.360]   like Apple is gonna be in a good place for a while Tim that's what Tim Cook is
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:37.200]   good at but it's also like yeah Microsoft back a decade ago bomber was
[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:41.760]   really good at kind of you know making money at a certain point but not as much
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:45.040]   with the big ideas and the big innovations and then we've seen Microsoft
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:49.360]   make some big shifts with Satya Nadella I'm wondering like yeah what does Apple
[01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:53.960]   need to kind of get that mojo back it's interesting I'm looking at the not
[01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:58.560]   again you mentioned this is stock price isn't isn't everything by any means but
[01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:01.560]   I'm looking at Microsoft's I've screwed up the the graph somehow I'm looking at
[01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:05.680]   Microsoft's stock price and the period that you mentioned they've been flat for
[01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:11.080]   years you know they're big Microsoft's big stock growth was in the late 90s
[01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:18.040]   they've been flat for years and then so this is the big growth here then flat
[01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:23.320]   flat flat flat flat then along comes Satya Nadella and a new attention to the
[01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:29.640]   cloud and Microsoft's been really on a tear over the last three years yeah so
[01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:33.120]   it is very telling I remember for years we said you know Microsoft stock
[01:27:33.120 --> 01:27:39.920]   beyond what you know it's why is it going nowhere so so there is so there's
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:42.800]   be something that said for that strategy what would you do though if you're
[01:27:42.800 --> 01:27:47.600]   Apple I mean this is challenging you can you can only sell so there's only so
[01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:51.000]   many people in the world you can sell iPhones to and and there's no way to dig
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:58.080]   up Steve Jobs you can you can get him to come back you know invest in AI and
[01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:03.160]   replicate that's what I mean go ahead
[01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:06.640]   just you know I was just gonna say when we have seen them try to go into other
[01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:10.240]   things you know that the car project is apparently completely changed forces so
[01:28:10.240 --> 01:28:15.040]   that's a difficult thing because you know sometimes things seem to work and
[01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:18.400]   sometimes they don't it's it's it's it's hard secrecy heard it because I mean I
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:23.280]   I am sure there are many projects going on in Apple R&D there's a lot of R&D
[01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:29.040]   going on and but we no one knows so all we see is kind of the big blank
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:35.080]   building in the success with the iPhone they may have the next thing I think it
[01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:38.480]   hurts it but I think that the the secrecy helps it as much as it hurts I
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:44.080]   think it if anything it's it evens out because people anticipate things and
[01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:49.520]   wait in a way that you might not if you outlined exactly what you're working
[01:28:49.520 --> 01:28:52.680]   on the way that say Google does it's a great marketing tool that's for sure
[01:28:52.680 --> 01:28:56.480]   in fact they're hurt a little bit by all these supply chain leaks now because
[01:28:56.480 --> 01:29:00.080]   last couple iPhone announcements we knew what we were gonna get ahead of time
[01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:03.480]   took all the fun out of it
[01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:08.900]   our show today brought to you by having fun with this great panel of people from
[01:29:08.900 --> 01:29:14.080]   Ed bot at ZD net to Christina Warren from Gizmodo and gadgets to vendor
[01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:20.600]   Harder War you guys are great if I you know I like to have panels in in in
[01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:24.720]   studio with us but somehow Skype doesn't seem to slow any of you down you do
[01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:31.360]   great I appreciate it our show today brought to you by a fantastic product
[01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:36.840]   called the tracker it's a Bluetooth tracker I think a lot of times I want to
[01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:39.720]   kind of do a little education on the track people look at it and they assume
[01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:44.760]   oh that's a GPS device it's not because you couldn't that would be crazy talk
[01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:48.880]   you'd have to charge it up every night wouldn't be a very useful tracker and
[01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:52.120]   it couldn't be the size of a quarter and it couldn't weigh you know just a few
[01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:58.240]   grams what this is is it it Bluetooth device that pairs to your GPS in your
[01:29:58.240 --> 01:30:04.120]   smartphone and helps you locate anything you lose according to Newsweek the
[01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:09.880]   average American spent 55 minutes a day looking for stuff they own but can't
[01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:17.640]   find 55 minutes a day for looking for lost keys and wallets and luggage and
[01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:24.160]   instruments and bicycles and pets 55 minutes a day and all you got to do is
[01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:27.920]   put a tracker on them you can pair up to 10 trackers to your smartphone it's
[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:33.280]   Bluetooth the L.E. so the battery lasts a good long time and tracker is one of the
[01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:36.880]   few Bluetooth tracking devices that has a replaceable battery so there's you
[01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:39.960]   know I really bothers me that some of these other devices when the battery does
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:43.520]   you throw you're expected to throw it out and buy another one not the tracker
[01:30:43.520 --> 01:30:48.800]   easy to pop in a new battery and get another year you can you can customize
[01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:54.080]   two-way separation alerts so if you leave your key let's say I put them on my
[01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:57.200]   keys if I leave the keys behind my phone goes hey you left the keys behind if I
[01:30:57.200 --> 01:31:01.200]   leave my phone behind the tracker beeps at me there's even a button on the
[01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:05.080]   tracker you can press it'll make your phone scream even if it's silenced so
[01:31:05.080 --> 01:31:09.120]   you you know that is really useful it's about the only thing I ever use the
[01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:13.880]   Apple watch for frankly you don't need an Apple watch you can get a $30 tracker
[01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:17.240]   to do it for you now the neatest thing about the tracker they've sold they're
[01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:19.520]   selling like hotcakes I talked to them a little while ago I think they were
[01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:22.280]   doing a hundred thousand new trackers a week three and a half million devices
[01:31:22.280 --> 01:31:27.560]   shipped and that's a good thing for you as a tracker owner because of the tracker
[01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:32.840]   crowd GPS network the largest in the world effective show that map and scroll
[01:31:32.840 --> 01:31:37.560]   out you'll see there's trackers all over the world so here's why this is a good
[01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:41.160]   thing for you when you get out of a hundred foot range obviously Bluetooth
[01:31:41.160 --> 01:31:44.880]   isn't gonna track so you'll have on your phone the last place it saw the
[01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:50.120]   phone but what if somebody picks up your keys and mails them to Malaysia why I
[01:31:50.120 --> 01:31:53.920]   don't know because they're bad people well now you think your keys were left

[01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:11.360]   moment but before we do that I think we should take a look at a lovely little
[01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:15.680]   movie that Victor has made for us Victor Bognot one of our editors every week he
[01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:21.760]   he watches every show like and and puts together a little cut down some of the
[01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:27.360]   best moments previously on to it we've heard about apples for a into original
[01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:33.240]   content for the Apple TV and now we have a trailer for Planet of the apps it's
[01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:37.480]   basically Shark Tank but for app developers I think I already do this show
[01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:44.360]   it's called iOS today we were hacked oh that's better than so yeah this week in
[01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:50.960]   Google let's all encrypt what do you say key base.io these are secure chats you
[01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:55.160]   also have a secure file system that are totally encrypted using public key
[01:33:55.160 --> 01:33:59.400]   crypto the new screen savers I'm gonna give you a little demo of the June
[01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:03.640]   Smart oven this is an oven connects the internet your smartphone it controls all
[01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:07.880]   of the cooking process which burners are on whether it's broiling or baking
[01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:10.880]   what temperature it is at so let me check the cookies of course I could just
[01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:15.040]   look to my left and look in the oven but why do that when you've got a video of
[01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:22.240]   the cookies cooking to it in live real-time tech just like you like it is there
[01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:26.320]   you can age minimum for old media status I'm kind of curious about your young old

[01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:06.320]   later this year the target release date is still this July but according to CEO
[01:35:06.320 --> 01:35:11.400]   Elon Musk that could change if suppliers can't meet Tesla's requirements in time

[01:35:55.760 --> 01:36:00.160]   week ahead back to you Leo thank you Jason also host of all about Android
[01:36:00.160 --> 01:36:04.880]   that's why he's excited about a he has a really blue pixel what do you carry a
[01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:09.160]   divinder these days are you iPhone or Android I still have an iPhone success
[01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:14.200]   I'm just I think I'm gonna refuse yeah to go with the headphone jack for now but
[01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:18.640]   I also have a pixel XL I'm playing around with he's a refuse Nick and I know
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:24.120]   what you have Christina that's obvious why is that obvious because I could tell
[01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:30.180]   you just a cell iPhone 7s person all the way and it's yeah I mean yeah the 7
[01:36:30.180 --> 01:36:37.480]   plus rose gold course I knew Ed are you still rocking that Windows phone I
[01:36:37.480 --> 01:36:45.480]   haven't used a Windows phone over two years I have I have a no I have a brand
[01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:54.960]   new I've relatively new iPhone 7 plus and I also have a Nexus 6P here that I've
[01:36:54.960 --> 01:37:00.040]   been using for about the I don't know the last last four months or so but I'm I'm
[01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:05.640]   in the I mean the iPhone ecosystem for a while now because you know that's where
[01:37:05.640 --> 01:37:11.160]   all the interesting stuff is happening that you know it's really a theme that I
[01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:15.480]   keep coming back to but you know 10 or 12 years ago people may have said that
[01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:18.840]   Windows machines were boring but that's where all the developers were and that's
[01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:22.240]   where you know that's where you had to get well now if you want to get stuff
[01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:26.840]   done iOS is where the developers are yeah I guess that's sort of true I hate
[01:37:26.840 --> 01:37:31.840]   to say it because I like Android a lot and I carry both just because you know
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:35.760]   that's my job if I had to choose though I think I'd probably go with a pixel I
[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:40.680]   reason I bring that up is we is you know we're it's gonna be that crazy season
[01:37:40.680 --> 01:37:44.920]   again mobile world Congress is coming up we're to see new Samsung phones next
[01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:51.120]   month the galaxy S8 not at Mobile World Congress but after now HTC is doing
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:54.400]   something interesting apparently they've they're eschewing the low-end and
[01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:59.200]   they're gonna go with high-end hardware they're gonna kind of follow the
[01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:04.200]   Apple root apples always avoided the inexpensive phones this they've announced
[01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:08.720]   this a month or so ago and I'm hoping we're gonna get it soon they I ordered
[01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:12.920]   one you know because I want to review it this is the HTC Ultra it's all about
[01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:18.400]   you the letter you and you know there's some personalization features and so
[01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:23.520]   forth HTC's always had interesting audio stuff they also have a second
[01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:28.280]   screen with icons on it and they've they've they've also abandoned the headphone
[01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:32.760]   jack they're gonna have a type C jack but they're one of the things that they're
[01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:39.080]   justifying that with is this kind of weird and I don't know how it's gonna
[01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:44.200]   work audio thing where you put in the headphones and it creates a personal
[01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:48.360]   audio profile I don't know if you have to do as you have to do with Samsung a
[01:38:48.360 --> 01:38:54.440]   sad a hearing test Samsung does that or if it just somehow knows it sounds
[01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:57.160]   like it just somehow knows because your inner ear is as unique as your
[01:38:57.160 --> 01:39:03.800]   fingerprint HTC you sonic audio platform analyzes your analyzes your inner ear
[01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:08.800]   and automatically adapts the sound profile to optimize your listening
[01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:11.480]   experience
[01:39:11.480 --> 01:39:19.240]   sure okay sure whatever sure sure it's not a thing but maybe it is maybe I just
[01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:25.600]   didn't know I bet you have to do a hearing test why did I bring this up oh I
[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:29.520]   know why they're so grateful that I pre-ordered when they sent me a backpack
[01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:36.280]   with all these toys in it and a personalized thank you note oh yeah with
[01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:43.880]   little Android toys and a thermos bottle and a t-shirt this now I don't think I
[01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:46.800]   don't think that I think they say I bet you there's anything that everybody
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:49.920]   orders one of these things because they're expensive that you know these are
[01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:55.560]   how much was it you know iPhone price whatever that is 749 probably
[01:39:55.560 --> 01:40:03.320]   I don't okay the old yeah 749 when I ordered when I ordered an X6P you know
[01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:08.120]   a year ago they sent you Lego charging stand right yeah yeah the whole Lego
[01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:11.560]   thing there you know that this that was a Christmas card or something I can't
[01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:15.560]   remember but yeah I would like the one company that will never do this is
[01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:19.760]   Apple they're not sending out 75.8 million backpacks I could tell you that
[01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:23.400]   right now but I think these other companies are doing anything they can to
[01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:27.560]   get your attention at this please buy my thing please but if you buy a pink
[01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:31.080]   MacBook you get the pink rose gold stickers so I mean there's that's
[01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:36.960]   something wait a minute you do yeah the the color you get gold with the gold
[01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:42.560]   pink black with the Mac Pro I got my black sticker I have a whole
[01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:46.200]   collection of Apple stickers I don't have the Mac Pro anymore I gave it to Nathan
[01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:50.080]   all of our his child but I stay I kept the sticker I thought that's exactly that
[01:40:50.080 --> 01:40:53.160]   was the best part I reviewed it I reviewed it I kept the stickers I
[01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:57.360]   like in the back yeah stickers yeah every time I was saying Christina something
[01:40:57.360 --> 01:41:01.800]   this stickers don't come back do they complain about that yeah they don't
[01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:06.280]   okay drop the stickers take the cannoli
[01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:15.160]   anyway mid-March they say they'll be shipping the HTC U ultra it's pretty and
[01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:19.720]   you know it's the real problem HTC has is is what everybody has is you can't
[01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:23.120]   what it's a glass slab what are you gonna do yeah all the phones are getting
[01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:26.280]   boring now but the Android phones in particular right they're all gonna have
[01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:31.160]   really really thin bezels really big screens and that's that's pretty much it
[01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:39.000]   yeah and and and Google is trying to establish that there's a market for
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:45.640]   high-end Android devices but I I'm not sure you know Android's proposition has
[01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:50.760]   always been you know we're half the price or a third of the price of an
[01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:54.400]   iPhone and the and the Chinese companies are doing a really good job of
[01:41:54.400 --> 01:42:02.520]   continuing absolutely see T.E. Huawei yes all of them doing that so the idea you
[01:42:02.520 --> 01:42:06.640]   know when I look at and in fact I looked when I was saying okay what am I gonna
[01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:13.800]   buy a phone here is it gonna be a iPhone 7 plus or or a pixel XP what
[01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:18.960]   Excel Excel Excel yeah is it yeah and and they're the same price well you know
[01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:23.000]   guess what I'm gonna get the I'm gonna get the one that's going to maintain its
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:27.320]   resale value and it's going to have you know all the developers writing apps
[01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:32.960]   for it it's also a really nice phone but you know at the same price I just don't
[01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:40.880]   understand whether there really is a market for high-end Android devices
[01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:47.160]   oh I think there is I just think that it's going to be specialized and and
[01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:51.600]   probably I mean I think that that Samsung's like market I mean I think that
[01:42:51.600 --> 01:42:56.040]   until I tell the note seven you know exploded that was it and I think that
[01:42:56.040 --> 01:42:59.920]   the S8 is gonna have a challenge because of the branding problem that Samsung
[01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:02.800]   has but I think that's honestly I think that's where Samsung is today you can
[01:43:02.800 --> 01:43:05.640]   they've gotten over that they even decided to keep the note brand for the
[01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:08.740]   note next year I mean we'll see we'll see if they keep the note brand or not I
[01:43:08.740 --> 01:43:13.180]   said they're gone I mean they said but we'll see I don't know they they have a
[01:43:13.180 --> 01:43:17.760]   lot of they've transcended it I think hi which I don't you think we're waiting
[01:43:17.760 --> 01:43:22.060]   for the S8 and look forward to the essay oh yeah but not another note right
[01:43:22.060 --> 01:43:26.480]   not exactly because I think that the essay it's fine I think then the note would
[01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:32.720]   be a problem the note will be the safest phone ever made seriously no well it
[01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:36.140]   ought to be if you were Samsung don't you think they would go bend over backwards
[01:43:36.140 --> 01:43:40.760]   to make sure it doesn't explode the essay definitely will be yeah I think I'll be
[01:43:40.760 --> 01:43:44.360]   I think it'll be the safest phone ever made I mean I think that's gonna be the
[01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:47.120]   interesting thing how do they market it and how much the marketing is around
[01:43:47.120 --> 01:43:50.200]   it's safe well you saw at their press conference they said we're gonna have an
[01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:53.200]   eight-step program with X-ray the we're gonna do all this stuff nobody's ever
[01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:57.720]   done before to make sure they're safe right but but but but my my broader point
[01:43:57.720 --> 01:44:00.960]   that was I mean I think Samsung has achieved a brand and HTC had this a
[01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:05.080]   little bit but they never quite got there where you know people buy a Samsung
[01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:08.660]   they're buying it for Samsung they're not buying every Android you know I agree
[01:44:08.660 --> 01:44:12.200]   it's that's that's that's that's the brand isn't it it's not Android and so I
[01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:15.580]   think I think that is your high-end Android phone I see a lot of people maybe
[01:44:15.580 --> 01:44:18.620]   it's just the people I hang around the nerds I hang around with us a lot of
[01:44:18.620 --> 01:44:23.700]   people was saying I love the pixel yeah the pixels are very fun it's about the
[01:44:23.700 --> 01:44:28.180]   most boring phone ever I mean it really they you know there was an article I
[01:44:28.180 --> 01:44:32.140]   can't remember who did the article trying you know Google got an interview
[01:44:32.140 --> 01:44:35.200]   with Google and the engineers who designed the pixel on the efforts they
[01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:40.080]   put into choosing and naming the colors and the chamfered edges and it was really
[01:44:40.080 --> 01:44:43.440]   it was so clearly just an attempt to say no really it's not a boring phone it's
[01:44:43.440 --> 01:44:47.920]   that it's but look at it you can't be boring I love it though oh I'm it's my
[01:44:47.920 --> 01:44:51.700]   it's a great it's my favorite Android phone right now I think I think I love
[01:44:51.700 --> 01:44:55.600]   it because it's fully embraced how boring it is exactly we can't exactly
[01:44:55.600 --> 01:44:59.560]   what can we do in the back let's get a little it's no more it's great it's no
[01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:04.900]   or definitely norm core phone is exactly it's normal for Android but hey it's
[01:45:04.900 --> 01:45:08.380]   great and people people who haven't seemed to love it I haven't spent enough
[01:45:08.380 --> 01:45:11.900]   time with it to give it like a full assessment but but little time I have
[01:45:11.900 --> 01:45:15.660]   them it's a great it's a great phone great camera they found a great camera I
[01:45:15.660 --> 01:45:20.380]   mean that's this could be to the iPhone I think it's the same sensor as the
[01:45:20.380 --> 01:45:24.460]   iPhone but everybody uses those Sony sensors it's the secret sauce after the
[01:45:24.460 --> 01:45:28.660]   thing right and they've done really I mean Samsung does good software too but
[01:45:28.660 --> 01:45:33.160]   yeah Google really nailed it which is very impressive so good on them by the
[01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:39.360]   way the chatroom agrees Christina you win the title for the title the the
[01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:43.640]   you the crown norm core Android that will be the title of the show or maybe
[01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:49.520]   norm core phone we haven't we're gonna bad norm core phone I like it one thing
[01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:53.480]   HTC is doing which is interesting I don't this I feel like they're on the
[01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:57.600]   precipice of bankruptcy maybe I'm wrong but this is a good this is not gonna
[01:45:57.600 --> 01:46:02.600]   help they're offering free one year what they call uh-oh protection for a
[01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:06.980]   crack screen or water damage for free replacement didn't they do that before
[01:46:06.980 --> 01:46:12.420]   yeah it's very consumer friendly oh they did this last time yeah but but what I
[01:46:12.420 --> 01:46:16.580]   mean hey you're spending 700 feelers on a phone that's great because well yeah
[01:46:16.580 --> 01:46:19.540]   kind of like get your Apple care built in I like that that's yeah that's what
[01:46:19.540 --> 01:46:27.120]   they say yeah all right but it does look like but it does look like the the
[01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:31.920]   same thing is happening in the high-end Android device category that has
[01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:36.540]   happened in the PC category if you look there's been this this weeding out of
[01:46:36.540 --> 01:46:42.460]   the used to be that you could go down you could count the top 10 PC makers and
[01:46:42.460 --> 01:46:47.840]   you know you'd have Toshiba down there and Fujitsu and you know their numbers
[01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:51.220]   wouldn't be that big but they were profitable and everything but those guys
[01:46:51.220 --> 01:46:55.840]   are are kind of disappearing yeah you know Toshiba Toshiba in particular is in
[01:46:55.840 --> 01:46:59.060]   big trouble and Fujitsu's gotten out of the business and Sony's gotten out of
[01:46:59.060 --> 01:47:02.460]   the business and you're getting this consolidation where the ones at the top
[01:47:02.460 --> 01:47:07.780]   are still doing okay the you know the Samsung same thing happened in
[01:47:07.780 --> 01:47:11.900]   televisions didn't it yeah yeah same thing happened in tele so you know it's
[01:47:11.900 --> 01:47:15.700]   sort of something that happens in technology but as the market is growing
[01:47:15.700 --> 01:47:22.580]   and expanding at you know at a at a huge rate you've got room for these you
[01:47:22.580 --> 01:47:29.320]   know rising tide lifts all boats etc but once it starts to flatten then you know
[01:47:29.320 --> 01:47:34.280]   if you're in position number six you know boy you're in trouble and I don't
[01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:40.600]   know where HTC is in all this but with you know with Huawei and LG in there
[01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:46.600]   underneath Samsung you know geez you know it doesn't it's it's not
[01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:50.400]   encouraging not good I would be surprised by this time next year if
[01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:55.320]   somebody buys HTC because yeah things are kind of rough for them yeah they're
[01:47:55.320 --> 01:48:00.280]   best their best stuff right now is their partnership with Valve for you know
[01:48:00.280 --> 01:48:04.180]   the vibe and everything well somebody said that I'll make money on the vibe I
[01:48:04.180 --> 01:48:08.380]   mean how much how many vibes you sell but I think you have mind share I think
[01:48:08.380 --> 01:48:12.840]   that it's at least I agree I agree with David read that's their best thing I
[01:48:12.840 --> 01:48:16.460]   think right now is that partnership and that's far more innovative than anything
[01:48:16.460 --> 01:48:20.420]   Apple's doing right now honestly like Apple has no foray into VR yet I'm sure
[01:48:20.420 --> 01:48:24.080]   we'll see something soon they need no lead screen on the phone for that so
[01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:28.580]   that'll probably all be tied into the iPhone 8 or whatever they call it but
[01:48:28.580 --> 01:48:33.660]   you know what Valve is sitting there as a company with a ton of money and with a
[01:48:33.660 --> 01:48:36.900]   partnership with a company like this they should just buy HTC just that's
[01:48:36.900 --> 01:48:40.820]   what I'm thinking about phones yeah well I mean and they might even need to buy
[01:48:40.820 --> 01:48:44.660]   all of HTC just buy you know the VR division and maybe part of the phone
[01:48:44.660 --> 01:48:47.380]   solutions that they're interested in because they're already separate it was a
[01:48:47.380 --> 01:48:53.620]   lot of things so top HTC doesn't even make it in the top 10 cell phone
[01:48:53.620 --> 01:48:59.300]   manufacturers top 5 are Samsung Apple Huawei one of the Chinese companies
[01:48:59.300 --> 01:49:03.940]   Oppo another Chinese company BBK communication equipment which I'm thinking
[01:49:03.940 --> 01:49:11.060]   probably is India but I don't know those those five together sell more phones
[01:49:11.060 --> 01:49:19.900]   than the rest total so yeah a lot of low-end devices in there too yes yes for
[01:49:19.900 --> 01:49:25.420]   for emerging for emerging okay as Chinese I guess I'm sorry yeah yeah the
[01:49:25.420 --> 01:49:28.540]   Chinese companies are gonna just as they have with television they're about to
[01:49:28.540 --> 01:49:33.540]   take over from Samsung LG Sony's long gone the Japanese companies are long
[01:49:33.540 --> 01:49:38.460]   gone it's gonna be TCL and what's the other one high-sense
[01:49:38.460 --> 01:49:45.540]   those high-sense yeah big TV makers yep Vizio still Vizio's Chinese now
[01:49:45.540 --> 01:49:50.740]   good news I know it is I know yeah has a closed officially but yeah I know
[01:49:50.740 --> 01:49:58.100]   yeah maybe maybe not yet but yeah okay I this is a good question how many of
[01:49:58.100 --> 01:50:04.500]   you read Mark Zuckerberg 6,000 word communique on the future of Facebook
[01:50:04.500 --> 01:50:10.620]   didn't do my homework I tried I read it did you okay Christina you win
[01:50:10.620 --> 01:50:16.980]   congratulations yeah what the hell does he mean I will save us the bots will
[01:50:16.980 --> 01:50:22.740]   save us I don't know building global community you published this on Thursday
[01:50:22.740 --> 01:50:27.780]   you know Facebook's mission statement was like one sentence to connect the
[01:50:27.780 --> 01:50:31.620]   world and make it better through connection or something like that somehow
[01:50:31.620 --> 01:50:37.820]   this turned into a 6,000 word manifesto I tried I really did really wants to be
[01:50:37.820 --> 01:50:43.860]   president guys he really really said he's not running oh yeah oh yeah it's not
[01:50:43.860 --> 01:50:47.420]   even it's not even they're not even hiding it all these campaign trips like
[01:50:47.420 --> 01:50:51.300]   these short trips everywhere meeting the people it's pretty clear you know
[01:50:51.300 --> 01:50:57.500]   also wants to I'm convinced wants to be president is that mark Cuban I think
[01:50:57.500 --> 01:51:01.060]   that's what the remember that was that that Trump tweet at a nowhere slamming
[01:51:01.060 --> 01:51:06.180]   mark Cuban and nowhere because Mark's running as as he's apparently is his
[01:51:06.180 --> 01:51:12.780]   president Trump strangely enough he and then Cuban at the all-star game came
[01:51:12.780 --> 01:51:21.860]   out in a jersey with the number 46 on it coincidence well he's a very good
[01:51:21.860 --> 01:51:26.740]   provocateur I guess yeah I would vote I would vote for Mark Zuckerberg I know
[01:51:26.740 --> 01:51:32.500]   that's nuts but I don't think that I would I'd have to hear his
[01:51:32.500 --> 01:51:36.940]   on the issues and who's he running out oh he's a nice guy question he's a
[01:51:36.940 --> 01:51:43.380]   very nice guy I just I don't know if he has the personality time he's one of us
[01:51:43.380 --> 01:51:49.380]   Christina he's one of us that's why bad that's why it's terrible I mean I
[01:51:49.380 --> 01:51:52.260]   wouldn't run for president I wouldn't want any of you guys you don't want me to
[01:51:52.260 --> 01:51:56.940]   run for president oh no you don't you think I I'm the worst does he have a
[01:51:56.940 --> 01:52:02.740]   private email server really yes private you know what turns out that's okay now
[01:52:02.740 --> 01:52:07.680]   did you didn't you get the memo that's okay yeah it's only okay when you're
[01:52:07.680 --> 01:52:11.420]   a when you're doing it that's how it goes but for Zuckerberg like I wouldn't be
[01:52:11.420 --> 01:52:15.420]   surprised in eight years or even somewhere down the line that he'd be
[01:52:15.420 --> 01:52:18.580]   thinking of this because you know everything we've read about his
[01:52:18.580 --> 01:52:22.020]   personality reading his biographies and everything it seems like he's changed
[01:52:22.020 --> 01:52:25.860]   quite a bit from you know the early days from his college days he's built
[01:52:25.860 --> 01:52:29.180]   Facebook to be a really interesting and fascinating company I don't think it's
[01:52:29.180 --> 01:52:33.380]   gonna save the world like he thinks it will but he's a very interesting person
[01:52:33.380 --> 01:52:36.780]   you know to consider in that sort of role because what he's doing Facebook is
[01:52:36.780 --> 01:52:43.260]   that jump for Instagram like you know I'm paying that sort of money I think
[01:52:43.260 --> 01:52:47.740]   ended up being a very smart move for him so there are certain things I think
[01:52:47.740 --> 01:52:51.340]   he's doing that could be interesting and smart for president you took a company
[01:52:51.340 --> 01:52:54.300]   public that was already making a lot of money and made it incredibly
[01:52:54.300 --> 01:52:59.060]   profitable like when you compare you know Facebook to Twitter or to Snapchat
[01:52:59.060 --> 01:53:03.420]   or to any others he's run a very good business I don't disagree I
[01:53:03.420 --> 01:53:06.220]   disagree with you Davenport I had the same immediate like gut reaction I was
[01:53:06.220 --> 01:53:09.140]   like oh well this is definitely part of the stump speech this is definitely the
[01:53:09.140 --> 01:53:14.820]   manifesto that says laying out you know my my candidacy candidate C but you
[01:53:14.820 --> 01:53:18.140]   used to be the way you would do that by the way you'd write a book right every
[01:53:18.140 --> 01:53:24.140]   president up to Obama you write a book yeah yeah exactly and now but but
[01:53:24.140 --> 01:53:28.580]   Zuckerberg is a child of us of our century and he's writing Facebook
[01:53:28.580 --> 01:53:32.220]   manifesto he's making he's writing medium posts on the on the phone medium
[01:53:32.220 --> 01:53:35.420]   that the Facebook has Facebook pages or whatever is that it's this is instant
[01:53:35.420 --> 01:53:39.460]   news isn't it you're right yeah the only reason I know it's not Facebook is
[01:53:39.460 --> 01:53:45.180]   because I have all these ads for recommended games and right but other
[01:53:45.180 --> 01:53:49.060]   than that it looks just like media if you just if you just if you just cut the
[01:53:49.060 --> 01:53:52.220]   right I just make it bigger and just cut the right part off it looks just like
[01:53:52.220 --> 01:53:59.100]   medium this is why I have a surface studio I can cut off the ads so these
[01:53:59.100 --> 01:54:04.700]   are the these are the five questions that he wants us to answer how do we help
[01:54:04.700 --> 01:54:08.220]   people build supportive communities by the way note the use of the word
[01:54:08.220 --> 01:54:12.780]   community how do we help people build a safe community how do we help people
[01:54:12.780 --> 01:54:16.940]   build an informed community how do we help people build a civically engaged
[01:54:16.940 --> 01:54:20.380]   community and how do we help people build inclusive community I mean these are
[01:54:20.380 --> 01:54:25.940]   all nice anodyne sentiments there's nothing wrong with any of this I don't
[01:54:25.940 --> 01:54:31.660]   know if it inspires I'm not gonna run to the barricades over it but yeah it fits
[01:54:31.660 --> 01:54:34.540]   into sort of what we were talking about though like the need to kind of change
[01:54:34.540 --> 01:54:39.300]   how we are looking at online community and communication in a way I'm not a
[01:54:39.300 --> 01:54:43.260]   fan of how much Facebook has basically taken over the internet instant
[01:54:43.260 --> 01:54:48.180]   articles and everything I love the open internet but I don't know maybe at some
[01:54:48.180 --> 01:54:52.940]   point we'll need some sort of ways to kind of make it a more welcoming
[01:54:52.940 --> 01:54:55.700]   platform for people in general I've mixed feelings on this you know and I
[01:54:55.700 --> 01:54:59.820]   always told the people who use medium or Facebook to publish that really you
[01:54:59.820 --> 01:55:03.700]   ought own your own and have your own website that's really old fashion yes but
[01:55:03.700 --> 01:55:08.020]   I mean Facebook doesn't replace the internet there's still an open internet
[01:55:08.020 --> 01:55:12.060]   it's just a one of the things you can do on the open internet well I mean what
[01:55:12.060 --> 01:55:16.020]   they tried to do in India they really wanted to replace the internet well okay
[01:55:16.020 --> 01:55:19.420]   and maybe this is a little devil's advocacy and I remember talking to
[01:55:19.420 --> 01:55:23.180]   Om Malak who said this is you know rejected out of hand saying it's just a
[01:55:23.180 --> 01:55:28.340]   form of imperialism and India knows better after the Raj and the you know
[01:55:28.340 --> 01:55:35.180]   English colonization of India that not to not to go for these freebies you
[01:55:35.180 --> 01:55:41.260]   know but from Mark's point of view he's looking at a giant population that has
[01:55:41.260 --> 01:55:46.820]   no internet can't afford an internet he's trying to find a way to subsidize sure
[01:55:46.820 --> 01:55:49.780]   part of the internet obviously you can't do the whole thing but he gives you
[01:55:49.780 --> 01:55:53.660]   Wikipedia and Health Women's Health Centers and things like that in addition
[01:55:53.660 --> 01:55:58.020]   to Facebook he what he's I mean and then that's a wonderful goal I don't think
[01:55:58.020 --> 01:56:01.380]   anybody just is discounting that but what you can also say well the any
[01:56:01.380 --> 01:56:06.460]   government did they said no well well exactly because as but I'm just saying
[01:56:06.460 --> 01:56:09.780]   like the broader pictures like oh that's a nice thing to do but that's not
[01:56:09.780 --> 01:56:13.220]   coming without strengths that's coming with strings where you're saying we will
[01:56:13.220 --> 01:56:18.340]   be deciding what people see and we will be the tunnel in which you see it and
[01:56:18.340 --> 01:56:21.820]   that is a very different thing than saying well we are going to give free
[01:56:21.820 --> 01:56:25.460]   data access to anyone to access it any way they want no they're saying we want
[01:56:25.460 --> 01:56:30.980]   you to access it through our lens and that's you know that's that's understandable
[01:56:30.980 --> 01:56:34.540]   that's that's saying we want to get people online but not because we want them to
[01:56:34.540 --> 01:56:38.100]   be online I mean maybe that's part of it we want them to be online through
[01:56:38.100 --> 01:56:44.500]   Facebook and so yes I understand why that was rejected because it does come
[01:56:44.500 --> 01:56:47.860]   across as very imperialistic where you're saying well people are going to be
[01:56:47.860 --> 01:56:50.660]   gaining access to things they might not have had access to but instead you're
[01:56:50.660 --> 01:56:55.820]   you are you know creating a whole new class of customer who are only going to
[01:56:55.820 --> 01:56:58.820]   know the internet as you and not know as anything else.
[01:56:58.820 --> 01:57:01.900]   Does Google's Loon Project by the way they've discovered they can do it with
[01:57:01.900 --> 01:57:05.900]   ten balloons now instead of many more. Does Google's Loon Project have the same
[01:57:05.900 --> 01:57:13.580]   strings or is it just internet? I mean I think it's not quite as it doesn't have
[01:57:13.580 --> 01:57:19.020]   quite as many strings pun intended as I think what Facebook was trying to do
[01:57:19.020 --> 01:57:23.380]   with India but it has some of the same concerns I mean I think their Google
[01:57:23.380 --> 01:57:28.220]   except for like the big market that they're notably absent and you know has an
[01:57:28.220 --> 01:57:30.980]   advantage and that they basically touch every piece of the internet whether you
[01:57:30.980 --> 01:57:35.020]   are through the Chrome browser or Android or not you're touching Google's ad
[01:57:35.020 --> 01:57:39.900]   servers Google ProT. You don't have to go to Google to to participate in Google
[01:57:39.900 --> 01:57:45.460]   you're doing it all the time. Exactly. But you know even beyond like Facebook's
[01:57:45.460 --> 01:57:50.100]   free internet offer the way Facebook is built today you know everything about
[01:57:50.100 --> 01:57:55.140]   instant articles the way they've been pushing Facebook video on you know on
[01:57:55.140 --> 01:57:59.780]   media companies they've definitely kind of insinuated themselves into the process
[01:57:59.780 --> 01:58:03.820]   of media and a lot of people just read news by going through their Facebook
[01:58:03.820 --> 01:58:07.780]   feed right instead of even going to a publication website they'll end up at on
[01:58:07.780 --> 01:58:11.420]   something on Facebook that's what's worrying me. Yeah no no I understand
[01:58:11.420 --> 01:58:18.700]   absolutely. The last four paragraphs of Mark's letter sound very much like a
[01:58:18.700 --> 01:58:25.020]   speech one would give if one wanted to run for president. Yeah history has had
[01:58:25.020 --> 01:58:29.980]   many moments like today if I had some echo and some crowd cheering could you
[01:58:29.980 --> 01:58:35.140]   could you help me with that Brian as we have made our great leaps from tribes to
[01:58:35.140 --> 01:58:39.820]   cities to nations we've always had to build social infrastructure like
[01:58:39.820 --> 01:58:44.820]   communities media and governments for us to thrive and reach the next level at
[01:58:44.820 --> 01:58:47.900]   each step we learned how to come together to solve our challenges and
[01:58:47.900 --> 01:58:51.580]   accomplish greater things than we could alone we've done it before we'll do it
[01:58:51.580 --> 01:58:56.740]   again. Oh now you're really in trouble he's gonna quote Lincoln. I am reminded of
[01:58:56.740 --> 01:59:03.100]   President Lincoln's remarks during the American Civil War. We can succeed only
[01:59:03.100 --> 01:59:08.700]   by concert. This is the worst quote he could pick. It is not can any of us
[01:59:08.700 --> 01:59:15.500]   imagine better but can we all do better? The dogmas of the quiet he must as well
[01:59:15.500 --> 01:59:20.740]   as being Latin. The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present
[01:59:20.740 --> 01:59:25.380]   the occasion is piled high with difficulty might be piled high but I
[01:59:25.380 --> 01:59:30.620]   don't know if it's difficulty and we must rise with the occasion as our cases do so
[01:59:30.620 --> 01:59:36.900]   must be think anew and act anew. It is an honor to be on this journey with you
[01:59:36.900 --> 01:59:39.860]   thank you for being part of this community thanks for everything you do to
[01:59:39.860 --> 01:59:44.420]   make the world more open and connected to me. He left off God bless you and God
[01:59:44.420 --> 01:59:48.220]   bless the United States of America that's very important thank you. Well he could
[01:59:48.220 --> 01:59:55.380]   he could really have used Lin-Manuel Miranda to you know to put some music
[01:59:55.380 --> 02:00:00.580]   around some of that. You know it's still really it really does sound like a
[02:00:00.580 --> 02:00:06.020]   stump speech it really does sound like a stump speech on the other hand there
[02:00:06.020 --> 02:00:11.300]   were it sounds like a nerdy stumps piece stumps well yeah but but you know what
[02:00:11.300 --> 02:00:16.540]   he said all the right words in those five statements there they might have
[02:00:16.540 --> 02:00:20.420]   been cliched but they were the things that I wanted to hear. Well that's why I
[02:00:20.420 --> 02:00:24.180]   felt for them. Yeah and they were the things that I haven't necessarily heard
[02:00:24.180 --> 02:00:30.980]   from the other tech CEOs who who made the pilgrimage to New York and didn't
[02:00:30.980 --> 02:00:36.020]   come back saying we agree we disagree we have a different vision we have the
[02:00:36.020 --> 02:00:41.420]   same vision they all just sort of went there sat there uncomfortably and then
[02:00:41.420 --> 02:00:46.460]   came out and and kept their mouth shut and so at least he's talking. Yeah talking
[02:00:46.460 --> 02:00:53.260]   and you know it's in platitudes but they're good platitudes. Yeah I mean and I
[02:00:53.260 --> 02:00:57.060]   don't blame the tech CEO I don't blame anybody because it's all baffling and I
[02:00:57.060 --> 02:01:01.540]   think that if you're a CEO of especially of a publicly held company it's very
[02:01:01.540 --> 02:01:07.700]   hard to understand what your duty is. Exactly. And and I think this is this is
[02:01:07.700 --> 02:01:14.540]   really a Terra Nova for everybody we're just all going. I mean unless you're
[02:01:14.540 --> 02:01:19.100]   unless you're IBM don't go ahead and repeat well Ginny Rometty's another man
[02:01:19.100 --> 02:01:24.980]   entirely. Yeah I think he's running I mean after reading you know the end of
[02:01:24.980 --> 02:01:33.220]   this that's and I would vote for him only because he's he's you know this is
[02:01:33.220 --> 02:01:39.500]   this is like a Harvard student report you know he's showing off a little bit
[02:01:39.500 --> 02:01:45.580]   he's using big words he's you know it's not deep I don't think it's deeply
[02:01:45.580 --> 02:01:49.500]   thought that's sorry Mark but it doesn't it doesn't feel like any any thought
[02:01:49.500 --> 02:01:54.660]   right now would be an improvement. Okay. Yeah I don't know I think we could do
[02:01:54.660 --> 02:01:59.980]   worse. He is not old enough to be president. No okay get ready he will be
[02:01:59.980 --> 02:02:09.460]   yours. He'll be 35 on the on August 2019 he turns or 2020 35. So he will be
[02:02:09.460 --> 02:02:15.540]   able to file. Yeah right at the end. I think he's clearly playing a long
[02:02:15.540 --> 02:02:20.180]   game. Yes. He might not be in 2020 might be 2024. He's young enough that he can
[02:02:20.180 --> 02:02:26.260]   he could do that or or 2034. Yeah you know he's got 40 good years in him.
[02:02:26.260 --> 02:02:35.260]   2036. Yeah. Got some time. He's 40 years younger than President Trump. So you know
[02:02:35.260 --> 02:02:40.260]   there's that and I also kind of think like imagine if Bill Gates decided to
[02:02:40.260 --> 02:02:45.860]   run you know a little while ago. What did you think of Bill Gates's yeah statement
[02:02:45.860 --> 02:02:49.020]   that robots should be taxed. Let's take a break and then I want to ask that that.
[02:02:49.020 --> 02:02:53.780]   I thought that was really well it's definitely out of the box. It's
[02:02:53.780 --> 02:02:57.860]   interesting. It's interesting. Well you know everybody's trying these you know
[02:02:57.860 --> 02:03:00.460]   we're talking about universal basic income. We're really kind of trying to
[02:03:00.460 --> 02:03:04.380]   figure out what is this new world where jobs are disappearing to automation
[02:03:04.380 --> 02:03:08.180]   artificial intelligence is spread like a peanut butter over everything. What
[02:03:08.180 --> 02:03:11.860]   is this new world look like and how do you survive it. And I commend people
[02:03:11.860 --> 02:03:16.740]   like Bill Gates for at least trying stuff. I don't know what economists might think
[02:03:16.740 --> 02:03:20.180]   we'll take a break and we'll talk about that. Our show today by the way great
[02:03:20.180 --> 02:03:24.540]   panel. I got I got to give you all praise every every time we get together. So

[02:06:40.500 --> 02:06:46.660]   the head from Anthony in the Squarespace team Squarespace.com offer code TWIT.
[02:06:46.660 --> 02:06:50.220]   We have to do that because Squarespace is advertising they were on the Super Bowl
[02:06:50.220 --> 02:06:55.100]   so we have to let them know no no these guys came from TWIT and it helps us so
[02:06:55.100 --> 02:07:01.020]   if you do that that'd be really really great. So I don't know if Bill Gates I
[02:07:01.020 --> 02:07:06.860]   don't know if he's just kind of blue-skying or if this is like serious but it
[02:07:06.860 --> 02:07:10.340]   kind of made sense to me maybe that's because I'm not an economist but he says
[02:07:10.340 --> 02:07:15.780]   if robots are gonna take her job they ought to be taxed yeah and pay social
[02:07:15.780 --> 02:07:21.340]   security yeah it's it's a it's very provocative it's a great it's a great
[02:07:21.340 --> 02:07:27.940]   point I mean potential point like it's yeah mm-hmm I mean do you have to make up
[02:07:27.940 --> 02:07:32.540]   for the taxes right exactly and you'd have to make up for the taxes that the
[02:07:32.540 --> 02:07:37.300]   workers would have paid but also like what is gonna happen with all of these
[02:07:37.300 --> 02:07:41.380]   people like that's that's the bigger thing like are we gonna have to companies
[02:07:41.380 --> 02:07:46.780]   may need to help pay for the training for new types of jobs or something my
[02:07:46.780 --> 02:07:51.180]   pie in the sky thing is like eventually a what a universal basic and
[02:07:51.180 --> 02:07:55.340]   universal basic income which will probably never happen but this is kind
[02:07:55.340 --> 02:08:00.580]   of how you get that started. Yeah no I think you're right because so many people
[02:08:00.580 --> 02:08:04.340]   are moving to automation even when it doesn't always make sense sometimes it
[02:08:04.340 --> 02:08:07.820]   totally makes sense to move to automation in some cases it can actually you know
[02:08:07.820 --> 02:08:12.420]   cost more and and and not save a huge amount of time because they want to cut
[02:08:12.420 --> 02:08:16.460]   down on workforce spending and taxes and other things and and that's all well and
[02:08:16.460 --> 02:08:19.860]   good but if you're going to be doing that I mean I do think that's a very
[02:08:19.860 --> 02:08:23.460]   interesting idea to say okay well you've got at least pay for some of the corporate
[02:08:23.460 --> 02:08:26.900]   taxes or some of the other taxes that you would be missing out on because of
[02:08:26.900 --> 02:08:33.420]   this. Well the economic concept involved here is called externalities and it's
[02:08:33.420 --> 02:08:37.860]   something that we as a nation you know we talked about how the internet was
[02:08:37.860 --> 02:08:43.060]   developed without people thinking about the long-term consequences of how it
[02:08:43.060 --> 02:08:47.380]   was being built about how it would be well those are externalities that you
[02:08:47.380 --> 02:08:51.580]   know cars were built without thinking about oh all the carbon they're going to
[02:08:51.580 --> 02:08:56.580]   be putting into the environment or all the you know or the the roads that are
[02:08:56.580 --> 02:09:00.380]   going to have to be built there so they were given that the you know the car
[02:09:00.380 --> 02:09:05.660]   makers were basically given free subsidies early on because they weren't paying
[02:09:05.660 --> 02:09:11.940]   for the externalities the the pollution that their devices were emitting that
[02:09:11.940 --> 02:09:16.820]   were causing they were causing impact on third parties everywhere in the world
[02:09:16.820 --> 02:09:22.340]   so it's nice to have someone thinking early on in the process about building
[02:09:22.340 --> 02:09:28.220]   a way to compensate third parties for externalities you know into the into the
[02:09:28.220 --> 02:09:33.180]   thing you know Bill Gates has turned out to be you know he's a pretty smart guy
[02:09:33.180 --> 02:09:39.420]   I'll tell you what I knew him you know way back when and the transformation
[02:09:39.420 --> 02:09:48.180]   that he has made from you know ruthless capitalist to the guy who who you know
[02:09:48.180 --> 02:09:53.180]   is obsessed he has as he is obsessed with saving the lives of children now as
[02:09:53.180 --> 02:10:00.540]   he was with you know selling PCs back in you know 1983 it's you know it's
[02:10:00.540 --> 02:10:05.820]   amazing did you speaking of that did you see I mean speaking of saving lives the
[02:10:05.820 --> 02:10:11.900]   billamal indicates annual letter this year for their foundation was great they
[02:10:11.900 --> 02:10:17.620]   start with a letter from Warren Buffett to them last December saying you know
[02:10:17.620 --> 02:10:21.620]   because Buffett made a historically huge if I think the huge the largest donation
[02:10:21.620 --> 02:10:28.580]   ever in history to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and he said now of
[02:10:28.580 --> 02:10:34.820]   course a non-profit of foundation isn't the same as as a business and so an
[02:10:34.820 --> 02:10:38.940]   annual report on your profit and so forth isn't the same thing but it would be
[02:10:38.940 --> 02:10:47.620]   nice for me and others to know what you did with my money there was a scorecard
[02:10:47.620 --> 02:10:54.860]   and I loved it because Bill and Melinda took them at his word and said okay they
[02:10:54.860 --> 02:10:57.580]   said ten years ago when we got first word of your gift to the foundation we
[02:10:57.580 --> 02:11:02.900]   were speechless it was the biggest single gift anyone ever gave anybody for
[02:11:02.900 --> 02:11:07.460]   anything and we know we owe you a fantastic return on your investment and
[02:11:07.460 --> 02:11:12.420]   this is the return that they said the number of children's lives saved a
[02:11:12.420 --> 02:11:21.700]   hundred and twenty two million since 1990 a big deal a big deal you know and they
[02:11:21.700 --> 02:11:25.620]   they explain with this this number comes from the number of childhood deaths
[02:11:25.620 --> 02:11:32.820]   since 1990 kids under five has been cut in half and it's in great part because
[02:11:32.820 --> 02:11:38.140]   of inoculations that the Gates Foundation has provided worldwide
[02:11:38.140 --> 02:11:45.220]   reducing childhood mortality education nutrition they say the best deal is
[02:11:45.220 --> 02:11:52.300]   vaccinations global vaccination coverage is at its highest that it's ever been and
[02:11:52.300 --> 02:11:57.660]   a lot of this comes from that money that Warren Buffet and Bill and others
[02:11:57.660 --> 02:12:02.860]   gave to the foundation it's a great letter so you're right I think he is a
[02:12:02.860 --> 02:12:10.060]   really interesting it's it it's not like Andrew Carnegie who felt so guilty
[02:12:10.060 --> 02:12:16.460]   right about trust about the the steel business and busting unions that he
[02:12:16.460 --> 02:12:21.540]   built got libraries all over the place to a swage is got guilty conscience I think
[02:12:21.540 --> 02:12:25.580]   Bill really I don't think he has anything to apologize for for the success of
[02:12:25.580 --> 02:12:29.700]   Microsoft to change the world and I love it that he says I'm gonna give it all
[02:12:29.700 --> 02:12:35.820]   away and I think Warren Buffet wants to do the same and relating it to Zuckerberg
[02:12:35.820 --> 02:12:40.740]   too like it's nice and Mark's always looked at yeah like Mark is looking at him
[02:12:40.740 --> 02:12:44.100]   as a role model and that is probably the best news we could see like look at
[02:12:44.100 --> 02:12:47.420]   their foundation that you know Zuckerberg and his wife are starting to yeah so I
[02:12:47.420 --> 02:12:53.300]   think with that sort of role model in place yeah it would be yeah fascinating
[02:12:53.300 --> 02:12:56.940]   to see what Zuckerberg could do if he would were to run as president eventually
[02:12:56.940 --> 02:13:01.100]   I didn't ask you but when we were talking about cell phones maybe I should bring
[02:13:01.100 --> 02:13:04.940]   this up now Verizon this week said yeah we'll do unlimited to and now every all
[02:13:04.940 --> 02:13:08.620]   four carriers in the US for big carriers offer unlimited data and I
[02:13:08.620 --> 02:13:15.980]   remember when AT&T was at Ralph I think said the worst mistake he ever made when
[02:13:15.980 --> 02:13:18.860]   AT&T started selling the iPhone was offering unlimited data it's the
[02:13:18.860 --> 02:13:23.580]   it's his biggest regret right but they're back it's they're doing it again well
[02:13:23.580 --> 02:13:28.220]   it's unlimited there's there's a huge aspect wait wait you missed folks who are
[02:13:28.220 --> 02:13:31.820]   listening only you missed the air quotes there's air quotes sorry there's
[02:13:31.820 --> 02:13:37.140]   airways unlimited it's unlimited with with with because caveats are very much a
[02:13:37.140 --> 02:13:41.140]   part of this yeah because well there's no unlimited it is unlimited but after
[02:13:41.140 --> 02:13:46.300]   22 gigabytes at least with Verizon it'll slow down a lot yes 22 gigabytes with
[02:13:46.300 --> 02:13:52.460]   Verizon and 28 with C mobile 23 with sprints and they don't guarantee that
[02:13:52.460 --> 02:13:55.540]   they'll slow it down but they say that they can then there is the limit of
[02:13:55.540 --> 02:13:59.140]   tethering so if you want to use it for hotspot you're limited to 10 gigabytes
[02:13:59.140 --> 02:14:03.020]   of LEE they used to charge for that that's part of the deal now so that's
[02:14:03.020 --> 02:14:06.740]   good well we'll use to charge for that um didn't Verizon oh no they couldn't
[02:14:06.740 --> 02:14:10.220]   right they had a consent decree exactly it was all part of the same thing and I
[02:14:10.220 --> 02:14:15.300]   think AT&T I'm not sure how it works I know the AT&T unlimited plan does not
[02:14:15.300 --> 02:14:20.180]   include tethering at all but Verizon and and sprint excuse me T mobile and
[02:14:20.180 --> 02:14:24.380]   sprint used to charge extra if you wanted to use your quote-unquote unlimited
[02:14:24.380 --> 02:14:29.320]   accounts with tethering now you don't have to but if you use more than 10
[02:14:29.320 --> 02:14:35.300]   gigabytes then you get shut down to 3G speeds on Verizon and T mobile and 2G
[02:14:35.300 --> 02:14:41.940]   speeds on sprints but I mean look hell has frozen over right like I never
[02:14:41.940 --> 02:14:47.220]   thought like in in 2017 we'd be even remotely talking about with an
[02:14:47.220 --> 02:14:51.300]   asterisk or not anything with the word unlimited and Verizon in the same
[02:14:51.300 --> 02:14:55.860]   sentence is it fair to give D mobile and John Ledger credit for this for sure
[02:14:55.860 --> 02:15:01.540]   yes yes I would say that he definitely forced everybody else's hands in my
[02:15:01.540 --> 02:15:06.260]   opinion I think that he with an in T mobile subscribers have you know gone
[02:15:06.260 --> 02:15:10.260]   through the roof like they are still very much in third place but like they've
[02:15:10.260 --> 02:15:14.420]   passed sprint and some time last year and that was a big deal and and they
[02:15:14.420 --> 02:15:18.460]   continue to add new subscribers every single quarter and I think a lot of it
[02:15:18.460 --> 02:15:21.900]   is because John Logere has been so aggressive and T mobile has been so
[02:15:21.900 --> 02:15:25.860]   aggressive with their pricing that it kind of forced everybody else's hands
[02:15:25.860 --> 02:15:29.940]   and then what happened was when Verizon followed suit which was not expected
[02:15:29.940 --> 02:15:34.900]   at least I was surprised you know T mobile has to immediately follow up and
[02:15:34.900 --> 02:15:39.260]   take some of the worst caveats and their plans and make it part of their
[02:15:39.260 --> 02:15:44.860]   official thing sprint had to make changes and then finally you know AT&T who you
[02:15:44.860 --> 02:15:48.900]   know have been a really big holdout almost as big of a holdout as as Verizon
[02:15:48.900 --> 02:15:54.140]   came back and said okay we'll do an unlimited plan as well so you know who
[02:15:54.140 --> 02:15:58.620]   I want to give credit to who's that US antitrust regulators who prevented a
[02:15:58.620 --> 02:16:03.540]   T mobile sprint merger who prevented AT&T T mobile merger who kept four
[02:16:03.540 --> 02:16:09.180]   companies in play because really it's because a competition I would agree
[02:16:09.180 --> 02:16:12.060]   with that I would agree with that and then of course that you know now it's
[02:16:12.060 --> 02:16:17.180]   out the window now it's the window in salt bank it's very interesting you know
[02:16:17.180 --> 02:16:21.060]   before the the rumor was that you know sprint wanted or the the not the
[02:16:21.060 --> 02:16:24.260]   rumor the story was you know sprint wanted to buy T mobile and then sprint
[02:16:24.260 --> 02:16:28.420]   would basically run the two companies and now there was a Reuters report that
[02:16:28.420 --> 02:16:32.940]   basically indicates that soft bank is willing to to sell itself to to do is
[02:16:32.940 --> 02:16:39.260]   telecom and basically say okay how much will you give us for for sprint which
[02:16:39.260 --> 02:16:44.740]   is we'll see if that would be allowed to happen or not I mean obviously AT&T was
[02:16:44.740 --> 02:16:49.580]   not allowed to buy T-Mobile sprint wasn't allowed by T-Mobile but we'll see with
[02:16:49.580 --> 02:16:53.580]   with the different administration if T-Mobile and sprint could actually
[02:16:53.580 --> 02:16:58.060]   emerge yeah and Christina you mentioned that you were surprised to see this
[02:16:58.060 --> 02:17:02.700]   news too I'm actually I'm not that sure about it because I feel like we had to
[02:17:02.700 --> 02:17:06.820]   get back to limited data we've been they all these companies have been selling
[02:17:06.820 --> 02:17:11.460]   its networks are supposedly super fast crazy fast in some respects like LT is
[02:17:11.460 --> 02:17:15.780]   faster than most people's home broadband and we have you know we all are
[02:17:15.780 --> 02:17:19.900]   basically driving around with super powered we're it's like we're driving
[02:17:19.900 --> 02:17:23.460]   you know really really fast cars and we could just drive them up around the block
[02:17:23.460 --> 02:17:26.500]   a couple of times like we've been incredibly limited with these networks
[02:17:26.500 --> 02:17:32.260]   and with the salary and the four oh five you're not going exactly are they you
[02:17:32.260 --> 02:17:37.620]   guys really what is it the side expressway or whatever yeah long as you guys
[02:17:37.620 --> 02:17:40.980]   know what's gonna happen though right what we're gonna we all get unlimited
[02:17:40.980 --> 02:17:44.980]   data right as they're about to start introduction of 5G and once 5G comes
[02:17:44.980 --> 02:17:48.500]   out I guarantee you I guarantee you that there will get these unlimited plans
[02:17:48.500 --> 02:17:52.780]   will not work with 5G if they're gonna start the charging thing all over again
[02:17:52.780 --> 02:17:55.900]   I mean because that's what happened with with 3G right like you had the
[02:17:55.900 --> 02:18:00.540]   unlimited 3G but if you want LTE and then you'd have to pay more and then
[02:18:00.540 --> 02:18:03.460]   eventually those companies people who were on those grandfathered and plans
[02:18:03.460 --> 02:18:08.340]   were forced to get the 4G support but it took a while and it took like lawyers
[02:18:08.340 --> 02:18:13.940]   getting involved and say no you can't actually Elon's gonna fix this
[02:18:13.940 --> 02:18:19.780]   Elon is gonna fix this we're gonna have gigabit internet from satellites 4,000
[02:18:19.780 --> 02:18:26.220]   satellites rotating around the earth in a low Earth orbit yeah and how much is
[02:18:26.220 --> 02:18:33.700]   that gonna cost oh don't think about it is money they did file an application
[02:18:33.700 --> 02:18:41.420]   SpaceX file an application on Tuesday for with the FCC for as many as a thousand
[02:18:41.420 --> 02:18:47.140]   satellites be launched as soon as 2019 the idea is these are very low Earth
[02:18:47.140 --> 02:18:50.700]   orbit that means a low latency right and that's been a problem with satellite
[02:18:50.700 --> 02:18:53.780]   internet it's really the big problem is why project loon is thinking about
[02:18:53.780 --> 02:18:58.980]   stratospheric balloons while Mark Zuckerberg is thinking about killer
[02:18:58.980 --> 02:19:05.220]   drones I'm sorry it's not killer it's a killer drones because the lower the
[02:19:05.220 --> 02:19:09.380]   better the less latency and in fact the SpaceX says that they think latencies
[02:19:09.380 --> 02:19:14.140]   will be 25 to 35 milliseconds which is better than many terrestrial internet
[02:19:14.140 --> 02:19:22.740]   service providers you think this is pie in the sky literally coffee cans in the
[02:19:22.740 --> 02:19:30.460]   sky well it's a little much you know historically the the way to bet on any
[02:19:30.460 --> 02:19:37.100]   technological development on this is to bet against the people who are saying
[02:19:37.100 --> 02:19:46.820]   it's going to happen really soon and and and to put all your chips on on you
[02:19:46.820 --> 02:19:53.660]   know about four years after that because everyone overestimates the short-term
[02:19:53.660 --> 02:19:58.300]   disruption and then they're disappointed by it but then in the long term
[02:19:58.300 --> 02:20:04.660]   everything turns out to happen and be much more impressive than anyone said
[02:20:04.660 --> 02:20:08.220]   in the first place so yeah this isn't pie in the sky it's all going to happen
[02:20:08.220 --> 02:20:12.140]   it's just not going to be on any of the timelines that people are talking about
[02:20:12.140 --> 02:20:17.100]   right now I mean we'll see too like what they're proposing with 5g and
[02:20:17.100 --> 02:20:22.460]   everything is that it could get us much much faster speeds across longer
[02:20:22.460 --> 02:20:26.140]   distances and things like that so yeah I don't even I don't even know what the
[02:20:26.140 --> 02:20:31.140]   point like if 5g is as good as what they've been building up for so long yeah
[02:20:31.140 --> 02:20:34.820]   this may be kind of redundant at a point and to what you were saying to Christina
[02:20:34.820 --> 02:20:39.700]   like LT isn't going anywhere right it may get a little faster once at 5g
[02:20:39.700 --> 02:20:43.900]   networks start getting implemented but even if you're limited to unlimited or
[02:20:43.900 --> 02:20:47.980]   sorry yeah if if you're stuck with unlimited LT speed I like limited to
[02:20:47.980 --> 02:20:51.460]   unlimited I think that's a good phrase I agree with you I agree with you
[02:20:51.460 --> 02:20:57.140]   defender I mean the reality is I mean I actually 22 gigabytes is pretty good but
[02:20:57.140 --> 02:21:00.900]   at this point I do hope they will and you know what as networks get bigger
[02:21:00.900 --> 02:21:04.020]   start to increase those limits because more and more people can start to use
[02:21:04.020 --> 02:21:08.060]   their phones as their primary ISP because frankly it's faster and in many
[02:21:08.060 --> 02:21:12.140]   parts of the country better than what you might get you know through through
[02:21:12.140 --> 02:21:16.020]   through cable you know I'm getting dinged by Comcast because I went over a
[02:21:16.020 --> 02:21:21.220]   terabyte in a month and I imagine if I would hit that number with a cell phone
[02:21:21.220 --> 02:21:27.120]   too if that were yeah yeah soon well I think we should wrap this up we want
[02:21:27.120 --> 02:21:32.360]   to just to send out thoughts and prayers to people in Sweden after that
[02:21:32.360 --> 02:21:38.660]   terrific attack the other night I read about on the internet thank you I
[02:21:38.660 --> 02:21:44.140]   shouldn't say that thank you you should make it clear that the nothing actually
[02:21:44.140 --> 02:21:49.560]   nothing actually happened okay we just a guess you are listening like after the
[02:21:49.560 --> 02:21:54.900]   fact I saw it on Fox News nothing happened I'm googling how to I'm googling
[02:21:54.900 --> 02:22:01.000]   how to say douchebag in Sweden I know just wait the tweet will happen and you
[02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:06.020]   won't need to look it up thank you so much Ed bot zdnet plug something
[02:22:06.020 --> 02:22:13.080]   hashtag my new Sweden hashtag windows 10 inside out second edition out there
[02:22:13.080 --> 02:22:17.840]   we're working on an update to it we're gonna start doing we'll do three updates
[02:22:17.840 --> 02:22:22.440]   electronic updates over the next year so we're trying to keep the traditional
[02:22:22.440 --> 02:22:27.900]   printed book any book relevant in this fast-paced world so when does 10
[02:22:27.900 --> 02:22:34.220]   inside out second edition it's good book by the way if you want to Facebook
[02:22:34.220 --> 02:22:38.980]   does have a Swedish flag overlay that you could put on your Facebook icon to
[02:22:38.980 --> 02:22:42.240]   show your support for the troubled people of Sweden I think I'm gonna do
[02:22:42.240 --> 02:22:48.060]   that right now Christina Christina I think this is a good meme I want to I
[02:22:48.060 --> 02:22:55.440]   want to start this right now Christina Warren from the fabulous Gizmodo anything
