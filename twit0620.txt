[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320]   It's time for "Twit" this weekend Tech. We've got a great panel for you.
[00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.440]   Owen J. J. Stone, O. Doctor. He's always fun.
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.040]   He joins Tom Merritt from the Daily Tech News Show
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.400]   and Jason Heiner from Tech Republic. We're going to talk about drones.
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.840]   Jason's become a drone king. He's going to tell me about all the
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.080]   latest new drones. Apple and their new music plan
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.000]   plus the new iPad Pro. I have it right here. And why did Amazon buy whole foods
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.120]   for all that money?
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.480]   We'll explain it next on "Twit."

[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.480]   with the best tech journalist I can find. And in a beautiful summer afternoon at the end
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.160]   of June, that's actually not easy. But I'm very pleased that three of my favorite people
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.120]   can be consented to come in out of the sun, to come from the pool and to join us. Tom
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.400]   Merritt is here from the Daily Tech News Show and Tech Republic.
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.720]   Yeah, sometimes. I'm proud to sacrifice my vitamin D for this show.
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.760]   Thank you. Doesn't look like you've been getting a lot of it. So it never does.
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.840]   It's the it's the pasty boys show. Yes, it is. Hey, that's a good night for a boy band.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.800]   Yeah, pasty boys. We're here. And that's Jason Heiner. He lives in Louisville, but you'd
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.880]   never know it. He is the editor in chief of Tech Republic. He spends a lot of time indoors
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.280]   as well. Hey, Jason. Good to see you. Hey, great to be here.
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.800]   As ever. Clearly a Broadway fan. Whenever you broadcast
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.560]   from home, we see your Hamilton and your 1776 poster. Did you see 1776 on Broadway? You
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.320]   must have been too. No, I was too young, unfortunately. It's one of my favorites. So Hamilton is the
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.480]   best show I've ever seen by far. 1776 is kind of a classic. You know, it's I watch it every
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.640]   year on 4th of July. I always watch it. And I end up singing the songs in annoying all
[00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.320]   of my friends and family and coworkers. And and finally, somebody who's clearly not been
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:48.480]   in the sun at all and ages. Oh, and JJ Stone. Oh, doctor. I have a year round 10. I don't
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.360]   need this. The sun doesn't need me. He's in his his built in his featureless dark room
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.400]   that he's been adopted of the weight, the bat cave. Yeah. As I was guess what I did for
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:06.360]   you, Uncle Leo. What did you do? Oh, doctor? I did two things for you. One's on my Instagram.
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:16.040]   Okay. The other thing is I have switched from Mac to PC for the first time in 12 years.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:22.000]   You did that for me. I did. I did. Why do you think I would want you to do that? I am
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.200]   an apple lover too. Because look at your desktop. Look how you're looking down right
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.600]   now. What are you looking down at? Uncle Leo, Surface Studio, baby. Yeah. Yeah. And I wanted
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.680]   that so bad, but it does not have the power that I need. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. My last
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.880]   post right there. That's for you. Let me see. This is Oh, doctor. He's going to show us.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:45.920]   Oh, you got a vibe, baby. You got a boomerang. A vibe boomerang. Yeah. I'm going to test
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.080]   it out. Play with it for a little. You know what? You didn't do that for me. You did
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:54.200]   that for you. Hey, look, I come on this show. I bash it all the time. People yell at me
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.440]   and tell me I don't like the future. And so I figured I might as well just give it a
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.600]   little test run. Not other people haven't threw up all over themselves in their rooms.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:12.360]   So, um, can you see the most recent Silicon Valley there? They've got a fake Palmer Lucky.
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.920]   He's completely nerdy and they have and he's a VR guru and it's apparently completely
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:22.000]   a Huxter. And yeah, and there and at one point there's he walks through the office and there's
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.680]   all these giant pictures of him in the same post Palmer Lucky had on the cover of Newsweek
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:32.120]   where he looks like a plain other idiot doing his Oh, yeah, jumping up in the air. Yeah.
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:37.120]   And but he turns out to be a complete Huxter sells out to Hoolie, which is the Google.
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.960]   Well, but kind of be like selling that to Facebook. Anyway, they there's one point where
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.040]   Richard, the star of the show, our nerdy entrepreneur, he says, I don't do VR. It makes me sick. It
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:54.840]   makes me and he's just he's so sick. Anyway, we're seeing it. Yeah, they told him it was
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:01.000]   going to be better. They still got sick. Oh, did he? Yeah. Well, welcome. Nice to see
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.640]   all all three of you. And I'll be interested with your experiment with Windows. What did
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:13.720]   you get, Oh, doctor? I went back to my roots and I built a rise in seven, 1700. You went
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:20.520]   with the new AMD chip, man, this thing is obese. I'm up here. My 32 gig ram. I got my
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:27.480]   water coolant. It's it looks super sexy. It's so fast. Like I render videos and it's so
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:34.040]   fast compared to my Mac book pro that I had. And oh my goodness, it's so fast. And Windows
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:38.720]   doesn't suck. My stuff's not I just like it. I'm sad to say that I like it. I don't like
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:43.680]   that I like it, but I like Windows. That's the thing to say is is that Windows is
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.920]   in this man for the first week, you know, it goes downhill fast. But no, I think that
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.080]   Windows has gotten better. It's it's doesn't suck. It's it's a lukewarm endorsement, but
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:59.520]   it's bad accurate. It's yeah. Yeah. And frankly, as Apple as Mac OS has gotten worse, the distance
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:03.480]   between the two of them is is decreased. And the main thing is as you point out, you can
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:09.240]   get much better hardware now. Yeah. And for the price that I paid, like I ended up spending
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:14.600]   like 1700. And if I wanted anything close to the power that I'm getting, Apple wants
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:19.000]   like five grand and it's outdated until I got a week for the future of whatever and
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.840]   it'll be outdated by the time the future gets here. So I mean, I was just done with it and
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:28.920]   I use Creative Suite mostly anyway. So it's multi platform and the rendering on this thing.
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:33.240]   It just crushes. I know the stuff with the photo and the video that I'm doing and I love
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:38.880]   it. I have to. I like when I admit. Sorry. Go ahead, Liam. I just, you know, as you know,
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.240]   I got back for vacation, by the way, thanks to Jason Calicanas and Jason Snell, who filled
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:46.280]   in for me while I was gone. And while I'm on vacation, Apple has its event and announces
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:51.080]   the IMac Pro. And I thought they were joke. I thought this is I'm being punked because
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:57.160]   this is an IMac, a $5,000 I'm acting claim pros are going to want. Even though it's,
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:04.200]   you know, it's an IMac. It's not like you can add five SATA hard drives and. Yeah. I
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:08.800]   mean, that's no different than the Mac Pro, right? You can't really open that up either.
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:15.120]   And this starts at 5,000, although somebody imagined because Apple hasn't put out any
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:19.480]   other prices, what it would take to upgrade this to the top of the line Z on and everything.
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:25.920]   And they said it probably will top out around $17,000. And it's not as upgradable as the
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:31.080]   for one tenth the cost, which you build on. Yeah. And I mean, I didn't go in so because
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:36.040]   again, for me, I didn't spend that money for what I needed to be doing. A lot of work
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:40.760]   that I do now is like photography and video editing. So like just again, just going from
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:47.640]   my IMac and it was a 2014 IMac rendering an hour long video, took me almost 40 minutes.
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:52.520]   I did it in five minutes on this machine. Did you do research into what that what you give
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:57.080]   up when you go with the rise in as opposed to the Intel chip? I did. I didn't get my
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:02.480]   thunderbolt. Some of the display ports. I do like it must say. Yeah. So there, there's
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:07.600]   certain, but the price difference was just so good. It's like I guess been $500 and
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:12.520]   get something that they want $1,500 for. And it's equivalent in speed. Like you lose like
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:18.560]   maybe 1% or 2% on your rating. And it's like, why not? Especially since I was dipping
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:21.880]   my foot back in windows. I'm not trying to spend three grand on something. If I don't
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:26.040]   like windows like now, I'm comfortable with it. You know what I mean? I feel okay about
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:30.440]   the money I spent and everything like that. So happy. I always tell. Go ahead. I did the
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:35.000]   same thing. Sorry. I did the same thing. My son's really into video editing and computer
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:44.440]   animation and special effects work and that kind of thing. And my wife is a photographer.
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:52.400]   She is the Macbook pro of the newer one. My daughter has a Mac. I have Macs at work and
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:58.760]   stuff. I use windows too because at work we write about it a lot. But for my son, it
[00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:08.400]   was going to cost crazy amount to get a Mac. It was before the recent bump. And so I did.
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:12.240]   I got him a Windows machine. I was like, look, this is just the way to go. It hurts though.
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.000]   It hurts though a little bit, doesn't it? It just hurts a little bit. It does. I mean,
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:21.160]   there's no doubt. The thing about windows is windows is so much better on a desktop than
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:28.760]   it is on a laptop. Yes. On a desktop where you don't have to worry about sleep and all
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:33.960]   of those kinds of things. Windows great. Windows does fine. And if you're on creative cloud
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:38.120]   all the time, like Owen said, you spend all your time on that. It really is fine.
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:42.320]   Photoshop and Lightroom are exactly the same. And we use Premiere, of course, for editing.
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:48.760]   And Premiere. And so we, you know, our editors are using windows. They're using Windows 8.
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:52.240]   And they never leave. So it's all, you know, what's the difference?
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:57.080]   You spend your whole time in the app where windows really still struggles is on a laptop.
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:11:02.600]   I took one to China last year. And I did not want to bring any laptop that I cared anything
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:09.440]   about. And so I brought like this Samsung laptop with windows. And the thing it drove
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:14.160]   me, I mean, literally it drove me and I yelled at this thing all the whole week I was there
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.840]   because sleep, trying to get it out of sleep. I bring it out of sleep. And when it wake
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:22.560]   up, I'd hit the power button. That would shut the whole thing down. I hit the power button.
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:26.840]   It would start. But that we did. This was a daily occurrence because of the hardware
[00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:30.000]   software integration that being very good. That's the risk of multiple hardware vendors,
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.080]   right? Because I've got a Surface Book. And that thing is a dream. I open it up and look
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:37.040]   at it. But Tom, when did you get your Surface Book? Did you get it a year ago or did you
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:41.120]   just recently? Yeah, a year ago. Because it with a power management and was terrible
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:44.600]   for the first day. It was awful for a while. It's a little bit of a hot, we call it a
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:50.280]   hot, heavy hot bag syndrome because it would somehow not sleep. And when you would get
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:53.480]   it, take it out of the bag and be burning hot like in the battery be depleted. Because
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:57.280]   it never had that happen to me. It happened to me every single time would run all the
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:01.840]   time. Yeah. But and it's weird. The hinges we're weak. In fact, I should, somebody should
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:05.560]   if somebody could run and get me the I just got the new Surface laptop. You don't have
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:10.440]   to, Luis. I probably I'll go ahead if you want. It's in my office. One of our audience.
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:15.720]   I'll go get it. Yeah, it's in my office. That new Surface laptop with the with the with the
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:23.480]   fabric Alcantara. That's a little weird. I'll show you. But I have to say, I took on my
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:28.240]   trip. I took I decided this was funny. We're all going through this kind of same thing.
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:35.120]   I decided to get a Lenovo second generation X one yoga, which I think these think pads
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:41.440]   are pretty darn nice. And I was new. New HPs are really nice. And the lead books are very
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:49.000]   nice. Toshiba of all people. This new portage. There's some really nice hardware. I think
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.560]   that the laptops are getting better. I agree kind of with what you say that when the Microsoft
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:57.640]   still has trouble for some reason with power. I know I think that's partly Intel's fault.
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:04.880]   I think that the Skylake was not had real power issues. But and somehow Microsoft does
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:09.760]   seem to have solved this. This is the Microsoft laptop. For those of you listening at home,
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:18.480]   I'll describe it. It's red. And it has unaccountably fabric on the top. I don't know what what
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:22.680]   were they thinking? That's not going to wear well. I know that comes with a tiny dice.
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:28.520]   That you can. I thought maybe like a flea comb or something. Was it was a piecey magazine
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:33.000]   they rubbed Cheetos into it? I couldn't bring myself to do this. I should really add that
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.560]   on the list of things to send me when you spill some juice on it. You know what? Does anybody
[00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:41.360]   have any Cheetos? We could rub into this because don't don't do that. Don't do that. I'm waiting
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:44.760]   for you to send to me. I don't want a Cheeto laptop. Don't do it because the Internet has
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:47.880]   done it for you. Calm down. Yeah, they have done it. And they said we couldn't get it
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:53.640]   out. We tried and tried and it just permanent Cheeto. The other problem with this and it's
[00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:57.920]   not a bad laptop. It's very thin and light. It's all you know aluminum and it does run
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:06.160]   this weird version of Windows 10S which I'll talk about in a second. But I fix it said
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:11.120]   you can't get into it without tearing off this Alcantara fabric and there's no way to
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:18.560]   remove it without destroying it. So it's unrepairable. Not by any asset product to me.
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:25.080]   Yeah. They're keeping up with Apple aren't they? Yeah. But it's pretty and when people
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:30.280]   see it they go oh is that fabric on your I feel like it's from old people. I guess
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:36.240]   a shag laptop. It's like a shag laptop. It's a shag. It's a shag. It's a thing right?
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:40.760]   It is marketed for people who don't want to repair their laptop. Who don't want a full
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:45.720]   version of Windows. That's why Windows 10S is on there. Yeah. Although as I learned playing
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:51.080]   with this it's really Windows 10 Pro. It's not all they did is they yeah they flipped
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:55.120]   a switch that doesn't let you install anything which you can flip on 10 Pro by the way that
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:58.840]   won't let you install anything except from the App Store and then they disabled the there's
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:04.280]   no C prompt. I think this has to be the first Microsoft product in history not to have a
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:09.800]   DOS prompt right? That's sad. And there's you can't put you know Linux subsystem on
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:16.600]   anything. But it isn't more secure necessarily. In fact who was it that was able to was this
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:22.120]   eating net was able to put ransomware with jumping through some hoops that probably you
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:26.400]   know needed some social engineering also. You had to use you had to hit the task manager
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:32.440]   run word as a administrator. But but you were they were able to use a word macro to get
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:38.440]   ransomware on 10s. And I guess my point is because they had to put the win 32 subsystem
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:44.400]   on here for office. It's not anymore. I don't believe it'll end up being any more secure
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:48.480]   than Windows 10. So what are you giving up? You're giving up the Chrome you're giving
[00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:51.600]   up a decent email program you're giving up all sorts of stuff because you can only use
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:56.760]   stuff in the Windows store. And what are you getting? Very little. I mean it protects
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:03.040]   you. Jack baby. I think some users from accidentally installing things. Yeah. That's
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:11.200]   valid. Grandma can't go to soft media and download you know the ask toolbar. Right.
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.520]   And she'll be upset about that. But grandpa won't be because grandpa was the dumb one
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:18.880]   who didn't know to go to the ask to a lot. What was that? What was that horrible email
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:22.720]   grandma was always the savvy user grandma used that horrible email program. Remember that
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:28.560]   we put dancing bears and stuff in your signatures and what was that was grandpa. Oh was grandpa
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:36.120]   grandma was running Thunderbird. Thank you. Ace detective man. He's protecting us from
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:39.960]   ourselves. Thank you Tom Merritt. I appreciate it. I look at that keyboard and I think you
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:44.520]   remember how like when quarters were cool and as going back a long time and but you know
[00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:49.240]   how they would get like all rubs really thin like on your bottom but where you sat you
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:54.520]   know it is like it's like threadbare corduroy. That's exactly what it's going to be. It's
[00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:59.480]   going to be like the butt on your corduroys. You know when you. Incredible out of six
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:03.520]   resigning me. There's a factory for Microsoft employees wearing corduroy just to create
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:08.000]   these things. The good thing is you know I always name my laptops when I get them. I've
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.760]   named this one Al Kontara. So it's got to it's got to it came with its own name because
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:18.000]   that's the fake fabric they're using here Al Kontara. It's definitely they're going
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.920]   after Chromebook. I mean I think by and large it's not a crazy idea. I don't think the execution
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:29.080]   is terrific on that machine but I think they're going in the right direction going after Chromebook
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:34.240]   because more and more I've recommended at least half a dozen people in the past year
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:42.640]   get a Chromebook when they. This is expensive but but but this is not the ultimate product.
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:48.520]   I think that that Microsoft Envision this is 1299 as as you see it here. Have to Chromebook.
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:51.760]   No but there will be a hundred there there are some manufacturers doing a hundred ninety
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:56.680]   eight dollar version so yeah but it is in a secure is Chromebook. It's not really Chromebook
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:02.600]   and look at what's in the windows app store. It's not great stuff. Yeah it's Bob kiss.
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:06.920]   It's not and you know what you get on a Chromebook that you don't get on Windows 10 is Chrome.
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:13.320]   Kind of helps. You have to use edge on this. I mean if you're in the Microsoft ecosystem
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:18.520]   there for the people that are really bought into the Microsoft ecosystem it's maybe a better
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:23.280]   thing for a Chromebook if they're in Outlook if they're really into Office 365 if you know
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:28.520]   Skype is there I am client and all of that and then maybe it's a better thing for them
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:33.640]   and they're replacing a Windows laptop. These new like two three hundred dollar devices
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:38.040]   are going to come out. I think it might be a better machine for them. Yeah I mean I
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:44.880]   can't see anybody that I know that I'm going to recommend that or one of those machines
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:51.440]   instead of a Chromebook yet. I guess we'll see. My opinion is you should only get Windows
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:57.240]   because you want to be in the broad diverse application ecosystem that Windows offers.
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:04.040]   You want to do that variety of things that's why you get an operating system like Windows.
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:09.720]   If you don't then you should get a Chromebook. It doesn't make sense to get kind of a weird
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:13.440]   stripped down and perhaps not more secure version of Windows if you're not going to
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:19.720]   use the vast Windows ecosystem if you're going to take advantage of that. Yeah if you're
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:26.360]   somebody who needs to use Office but you don't really want anything else. But you can use
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:30.320]   Office on anything now. In fact Office the web version of Office runs on a Chromebook
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:35.640]   and there's there's still issues though especially with Excel spreadsheets and stuff. So I'm not
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:41.560]   saying it's a huge slice mind you know the cool thing about today is what's that. One
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:45.440]   we haven't even gotten to an article yet and two no one could talk to us about bashing and
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:50.320]   being Apple fanboys because we started this jump off about Windows it wasn't even a story.
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:54.400]   We would talk with it emails about when I can't win I can't win them because then I get the
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:59.440]   email saying how dare you host a show called Mac break weekly if you're not in love with
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:04.040]   Apple I don't understand it. And then somebody wrote me an email saying actually I think
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:07.680]   he wrote the company an email not understanding that there's not much distinction he wrote
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:13.280]   the company an email saying don't let Leo take vacation when there's an Apple event.
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:16.520]   And of course Apple didn't tell us there was going to be an event still of like a week
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:21.280]   before so yeah because they were going to introduce this 500 out. I don't know Apple's
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:25.400]   doing anymore their vision board. All right well I want to defend them in a second but
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:29.960]   first I have to say here's the one program you can't get on Windows 10 S that you wish
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:37.880]   you could the fabulous Increda mail is still available including animated email notifiers
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:46.520]   email backgrounds animations in your email 3d effects come on everybody download it.
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:50.240]   This was this is the bane of my existence incredible actually I shouldn't say that this
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:55.320]   is the reason that I still have a radio show because there's people download this crap
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:21:01.360]   and then they have to call me and saying what happened it's incredible it's incredible.
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:08.080]   It was so much fun it was so much fun and my computer blew up. I actually we should
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:12.520]   take a break but I do have the new iPad here and actually I think that the new iPad is
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:16.800]   a very is a surprise is a stealth product from Apple that there's something that more
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:23.400]   than just meets the eye here it's not just an upgrade to the iPad and it's a little more
[00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:28.320]   exciting than the iMac Pro for $5,000 but we will take a break and talk about that.
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:34.140]   Oh doctor is here it's great to have you from iqmz.com that's his website follow on Instagram
[00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:42.240]   OH D O C T A H and watch him throw up with his brand new 5 man that's not that's not
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:47.960]   I'm not letting that leak out anywhere it could leak out a lot of places actually it's
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:55.560]   like your views off of that you may be amazed where it leaks out virtual reality no no see
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:22:00.600]   now you scare me you may be amazed that we're at leaks out also with his Jason Heiner from
[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:05.040]   Tech Republic he's editor in chief over there and nominally has a little bit to do with
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:13.000]   Tom Merritt's app picks his five apps Tom Merritt's here from the daily tech news show.com great
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:19.480]   to have all three of my good buddies on the show it's good way to come back I have to say
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:23.240]   our show today brought to you by something you can use oh doctor with your new PC your
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:30.440]   new Drobo when this be great if you were like a game show I say doctor oh doctor you've
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:40.600]   just won a brand new Drobo 5 and 2. Oh man I'll clap it out Drobo's are sexy they are
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:46.280]   making Drobo sexy is a good word when these came out they were a revolution Drobo was
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:51.120]   started when its founder he was running raid right but he's running that raid that you
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:55.040]   get you know the software raid and he thought is you know he thought I'm never have a hard
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:23:00.400]   drive crash his his raid failed and he realized you can't recover this is then you can
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:04.640]   do with this I've lost my data so he said we could do a better job they created beyond
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:10.640]   raid which lets you easily add capacity to your live Drobo storage array has so many
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:15.440]   benefits over raid but all the redundancy benefits as well and I've been using Drobo
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:21.880]   for years both for speed capacity and redundancy I have a Drobo mini for instance I have attached
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:27.880]   to my iMac that gives me massive speed because it's Thunderbolt and it's got four SSDs in
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:33.240]   it plus all the new Drobo's now have these great little emsata accelerator base so you
[00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:37.920]   could put a little flash drive in the bottom there that really helps you with small file
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:44.240]   reads and writes they offer so many data backup features like the battery backup to
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:49.880]   cache that prevents write failure or data corruption should the power go out the cache
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:54.800]   saves it all and writes it all out you can open the front of these it's so easy they're
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:24:00.240]   just attached by magnets and then add drives without any tools the status lights in the
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:04.760]   front let you know exactly what's going on how much capacity is left I mentioned the
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:12.120]   5n2 this is their new network storage device and this is really awesome it's it's high
[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:17.400]   performance they've upgraded the processor double the performance over the it's a parrot
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:25.760]   5n dual bondable gigabit ethernet ports this is the nasa the future it is amazing five
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:31.560]   drive base you can put standard or SSD drives in there I like to use those what are they
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:36.520]   what the western digital uh Reds the the uh nasa drives in there and they're just fit
[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:40.200]   you get some huge capacity you could because you could put five drives in there I think
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:47.080]   you can get up to 30 terabytes in one of these 30 terabytes power failure protection I know
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:51.760]   they support a single smart volume of up to 64 terabytes but what's great about the
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:55.240]   drobo's is you can also just throw in whatever drives you got lying around because the drives
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:58.880]   don't have to be all the same as they do with other systems they don't have to have
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:03.720]   the same capacity drobo's beyond radial handle of variety and now because the 5n2's got
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:08.440]   all this processor power the drobo apps really sing like drobo picks for your photo backup
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:12.800]   you can put plex on there it's a great media streaming solution cloud apps for backup for
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:18.720]   data sinking there's a full lamp stack they've got no JS on there wordpress for web developers
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:23.000]   you're using angular you put angular on there you could have your home whole development
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:28.960]   stack right there in the house app developers can you see go pearl python ruby there's
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:34.240]   a get client you know what's great about that having your own get client is awesome I don't
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:39.160]   just use it for code I use it for everything so like if I'm running a document I use I
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:43.080]   commit it to get and I can commit changes I can restore it I can go back and forth it's
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:49.560]   awesome Drobo store calm that's where you can buy your new Drobo but if you do including
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:55.480]   the 5n2 you'll save an extra 10% on select models by using the offer code twit 10 T w
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:26:03.160]   i t 1 0 Drobo store dot com and we thank Drobo so much for providing such great hardware
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:09.760]   and supporting this week in tech I should I should agree discount 10% discounts pretty
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:17.160]   that's significant yeah a Drobo is the one company I think they should have that whole
[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:21.640]   we create magic stuff like you just be hot swapping it don't matter what kind of drive
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:26.800]   you going there it just works like for all these you know magical what no that's magic
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:32.080]   magic when I take some old and something new mix and match it it just works that's magic
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:36.200]   I don't know I'm not smart enough to understand the complex D's other speed but man it's
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:40.840]   magic working I think it's really where Drobo became and a lot of Mac users Apple users
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:44.440]   are Drobo fans and I think that's really one of the things that made Drobo in the very
[00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:48.360]   in the early days remember that Tom would when Drobo first started yeah yeah yeah it
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:52.080]   was like this is kind of the magical solution it was so much better than the other stuff
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:59.400]   out there and boy having you know all that storage online with Thunderbolt man it's fantastic
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:04.320]   every time you swap out hard drive from your laptop you just put the older hard drive in
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:10.760]   the Drobo and just exactly yeah yeah I mean it's cool it's still great I mean I know because
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:18.200]   of because of hard drives going more to SSD's right so you have smaller drives in your actual
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:23.240]   machine like I said my wife is a photographer and so more and more professional photographers
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:30.320]   and especially with these faster ports you know USB C USB 3 you know you they're using
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:36.160]   Drobo they're editing on on the machine right they don't load anything on to their local
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:41.800]   laptop yeah so that's right you know all these files are so huge are so huge now right
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:47.600]   on if you have in a way it saves you money because you can get 128 gig SSD as your boot
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:53.520]   drive yeah and that's plenty because you have all your data on these external you know high
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:58.040]   speed external drives that makes it big it's so much safer too right because you you've
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:02.280]   got it backed up if you're working off of a Drobo or an external device like that you
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:06.960]   have it backed up and then you run a backup off of that to the cloud you know you're in
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:13.600]   a good one drive yeah yeah that's Alex Lindsay's worked like that for years yeah so while I
[00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:20.080]   was gone so by the way Apple has made it way too easy to buy stuff because you could just
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:25.240]   use your fingerprint now with Apple Pay and the Apple Store I am on so I'm in the air
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:30.280]   flying to Miami during the Apple event I had no idea and we didn't have Wi-Fi so I wheels
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:34.800]   down I turn on the phone start reading I said oh the 10 5 came out before we got off the
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:42.320]   plane I had ordered one I like for 700 bucks I ordered one but I'm very happy I did actually
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:45.360]   first of all if you if you just look at it you're gonna say oh it's just you know it's
[00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:49.440]   another it's got a bit less of a bezel it's a little bit bigger screen roughly the size
[00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:58.200]   of an air too a little bit bigger but noticeable differences first of all the camera is an iPhone
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:03.840]   7 camera finally I've mixed feelings about this because I hate it when people use I don't
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:16.000]   know what I'm gonna ask like that's not even a thing it's the worst thing it concerts right
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.520]   you see all these people I know how ever from the point of view the photographer especially
[00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:25.480]   if you have a decent camera this is the first time they put a decent camera they I've had
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:30.280]   yeah you have the best viewfinder ever made is an amazing viewfinder especially for video
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:36.080]   you're looking at real time what is gonna look like so and then of course you're you're
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:42.440]   the so that's one two and you really will notice it only if you put this side by side
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:49.000]   with an older iPad the screen is remarkably good and it is so fast and I know people always
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.960]   say that but but usually the speed increments of 10 or 20% you really don't notice this
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:30:00.200]   one it feels to it feels like why do they put so much speed into it so and I have to credit
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:06.440]   Renee Richie and I'm more for this observation but this isn't this this new iPad isn't about
[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:11.240]   the current version of iOS it's not about the current apps available yeah this is this
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:15.800]   is the fall and I think this is why they delayed it this is for iOS 11 we're gonna put
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:20.720]   more PC like apps on here right here the file manager you're gonna be have drag and drop
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:28.240]   files but also this is an AR device an Apple announced the WWDC AR kit and that's why they
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:33.320]   have such a good screen such a good camera so much power in here nothing you can get today
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:40.560]   uses that it's all about augmented reality this fall and I have to say I really think
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:45.800]   that's what if you look at what Apple's released with the 10 5 it's it's it's it's a real strong
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:49.680]   indicator of what where Apple wants to go with the iPad and they need to go somewhere
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:54.920]   because nobody's buying these things I think it's also a Mac book air replacement I think
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:31:03.760]   right Jason Snell is writing a feature on this for tech republic on the I on the 10.5
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:12.040]   with iOS 11 the beta installed and sort of the power to use that as a replacement to
[00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:19.160]   a Macbook air and I've never I'm sort of not one of the candidates for this but I know
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:24.920]   people that are obviously really happy with it and I'm seeing more and more people with
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:32.320]   iPads still using them as replacements and so I think that it's going to be really interesting
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:35.840]   to see and so look look for that article from Jason Snell because if there's anybody that
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:44.920]   I trust to give a really sober but honest and enthusiastic opinion about it you know it's
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:52.200]   him absolutely it you know Apple's been advertising for a few months now that this is the replacement
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:58.000]   the iPad is replacement for your laptop and I've locked that but it's clear that's where
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   the company wants to go right a few if you were wondering what's the future of Mac OS
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.080]   I think this new iPad is telling you something.
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:14.960]   Now if you want to say if you want to go with that the only thing I can say is it's the most
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:20.560]   affordable unaffordable laptop replacement you could get because yeah it is expensive.
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:24.400]   Hold on give me a second I'm living out here in the real world I just came from a family
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:29.360]   of six they have Chromebooks they get they sold their iPads they just don't want to be
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:33.400]   a cause of the cost is too high but when you think about it as opposed to a MacBook Pro
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:39.040]   1500 yeah oh $700 and I feel like it's a laptop that's the cheapest Apple laptop you
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:43.560]   could buy so in that retrospect sure it's a great buy but I don't know how many people
[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:47.720]   are going to be dropping outside of the bubble in the world that we're living in.
[00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:51.360]   No I could be dropping 800 bucks on that thing as a laptop.
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:53.120]   Complete I completely agree with you.
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:55.360]   That Apple's never cared about that right.
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:33:00.520]   Oh no no no that's not what Apple's trying to do they are irrespective of price trying
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:06.920]   to create breakthrough products and they've never been tried to help people with a price.
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:12.640]   But this is a product that has a problem scaling now so this is something that they're
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:16.240]   hoping that might shift that because again like you said people have iPads are three
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:18.400]   years old they still work.
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:21.880]   I think what they've decided is we're not going to try to get those people we're going
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:29.160]   to try to get the people buying Macbooks not because they want to because they this is
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:32.800]   their they see this is the future is first of all touch is important.
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:38.080]   It's clear that I would say that Microsoft as good as it as Windows 10 as Windows 10
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:41.800]   is as a desktop operating system is a crappy tablet operating system.
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:43.480]   It's just not really.
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:48.680]   Yeah iOS is is the best tablet operating system even even Android doesn't come close
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:54.160]   and and certainly in terms of the app ecosystem there's no question but Apple doesn't care
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:59.000]   it don't kid yourself Apple doesn't care about cost and they never have look what
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.600]   they charge for this stuff.
[00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:05.480]   I know but that's I'm just talking about volume in the world and I don't care though.
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:09.120]   You're right you're right but I think they've never made a cheap iPhone they don't want
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:10.120]   to.
[00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:11.120]   It's not about people.
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:15.520]   No you're right it's not a mass market product Owen I agree with you.
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:20.600]   It's not I think but for the people who want who bought Macs and want to replace their
[00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:28.920]   Macbook Air I think that some of them not if they're creating photos or well no I
[00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:32.080]   think I think this is aimed at photographers.
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:33.080]   Do you.
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:34.080]   Yes.
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:40.240]   And even Adobe does by the way Adobe says our mobile app on iOS will have all the capabilities
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:44.680]   of Photoshop in the next year or so for adding not for taking photos.
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:46.880]   Yeah yeah for editing they think.
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:51.880]   Well it's an excuse me but it is an iPhone 7 camera I mean that's a pretty good camera.
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:57.040]   How many iPhone 7 photographers are there no I agree no I'm going to commercial for people
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:04.720]   like Jason's wife for I so I took a Windows laptop and a tablet with me on our last vacation
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:08.800]   took a two four thousand photos did it all in light room on a Windows laptop.
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:11.800]   I think the next time I could take.
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:15.560]   I believe it or not I could take an iPad I would still want to do raw processing once
[00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:21.160]   I got home but a lot of the because it's so light and portable a lot of the triage that
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:26.080]   you do daily on a big photo shoot you could do all the only thing it's missing and maybe
[00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:31.040]   there is a way to do this is I want to pick all my photos do everything I need to do and
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:36.880]   then I want to say import the raws on the desktop at home and somehow communicate from
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:44.400]   the light room on the iPad to Lightroom and Photoshop on the desktop these are the pics
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:46.640]   these are the adjustments.
[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:50.880]   You can flag photos in Lightroom now on the Lightroom app see I think that's going to
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:51.880]   happen.
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:52.880]   Yeah I do that.
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:55.520]   That's a reasonable workflow I don't think that's that is.
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:36:02.080]   And this is so light and with a keyboard now I think it does look I'm not going to replace
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:07.160]   my Windows laptop with this my workhorse with this I wouldn't want to Tom's write rights
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:11.600]   novels by the way congratulations on your novel we'll talk about that answer but you
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:13.760]   probably wouldn't want to write that on this.
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:17.800]   No I don't understand anyone replacing a laptop with a tablet.
[00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:18.800]   Yes.
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:23.760]   iOS 11 is going to do a lot to change some of my objections which have to do with file
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:27.000]   system and multi-tasking and multi-windows but it's not going to do enough to change
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:33.080]   my mind and the Pixel C did pretty much everything that the iPad Pro does with the keyboard and
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:36.280]   multi-windows and I never was going to replace my laptop with that.
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:40.440]   Yeah but it there were no good Android tablet apps I love the Pixel C form I love the Pixel
[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:45.480]   C still is it every day but none of these none of these are changing my mind the tablet
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:50.200]   is good for certain things for very tablet oriented things I use mine as a prompter I
[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:56.040]   use it to watch video when I'm traveling it's great on airplanes but I think Odoct has
[00:36:56.040 --> 00:37:00.640]   got it perfectly right it is a luxury device yeah it is something you get when you have
[00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:05.680]   the money to spend and can say you know what I want to have that nice portable 12 10 1/2
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:10.280]   inch screen that I can just pull out of my laptop bag I want to be able to tap out some
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:14.560]   emails maybe even edit some word documents on the go but it is not if you have to pick
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:16.560]   one it is not the device to pick.
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:22.640]   So and I tell on the radio show every in every weekend I tell people get a Chromebook that
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:25.040]   for most people you should just get a Chromebook.
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:29.960]   I'm shooting on a 5D mark 4 and an 80D you know what that tablet does for me it gives
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:34.760]   me a secondary screen to shift my pictures off and make selections and star them that
[00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:36.240]   is that iPad does.
[00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:37.840]   Well that's not bad.
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:43.560]   It's still good at single function I do the same thing I've got an iPad mini that I use
[00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:47.680]   I've been doing some drone photography with a DJI Mavic.
[00:37:47.680 --> 00:37:49.680]   Great drone photography too by the way brother.
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:51.360]   Let's see it where is it.
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:56.600]   Oh Instagram good at Instagram Jason dot Heiner at Instagram on Instagram.
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:04.040]   And with that I use that yeah the Mavic Pro and I use the iPad mini as a viewfinder instead
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:09.400]   of using my phone I don't want to tie up my phone on there and it's brilliant it works
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:10.960]   perfect for what it is.
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:14.000]   Which of these pictures is from the Mavic?
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.520]   The newest one right there of the bridge I just took that today.
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:19.520]   Look at that.
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:20.520]   Yeah.
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:21.520]   Gorgeous.
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:25.760]   So that one and then there's one yeah that one is not.
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:26.760]   Sorry.
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:28.560]   You're a photographer too.
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:31.680]   I didn't realize that Jason you look at this.
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:35.080]   Scroll down he's got one word of Mavic looks like a supermodel I thought that was a class
[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:37.840]   he's a little pitcher I'm going to steal it from my own in a couple months.
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:41.840]   Oh and purple.
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:44.120]   Drone itself it's sitting on a brick.
[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:51.160]   It's a picture of the Mavic itself I turned it into if you go down a little bit more it's
[00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:55.800]   a picture of the Mavic itself I made it like sit down you can make it look like a little
[00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:57.800]   robot right there.
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:39:00.240]   Oh that's that's it.
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:02.600]   That's a cool little picture.
[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:05.880]   Look at how clever and creative he is I'm stealing that.
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:09.800]   So how much is this is their new inexpensive one.
[00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:14.800]   Yeah the great thing about this drone is it folds up it's like the size of a water bottle.
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:16.240]   Oh that's right.
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:21.520]   It's awesome and that's why I wanted to you know use this one.
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:24.840]   How do you did you have a lot of drone experience before you got this.
[00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:29.200]   No just the ones we've tested right in the office and general because I can crash any
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:32.040]   drone even an uncrashable drone.
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:37.280]   This one I almost crashed it today for the first time but it was like it was super windy
[00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:42.680]   at the bridge and so it just almost blew it into traffic but I just pushed it up high
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:44.760]   and then got control of it and it was fine.
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:50.720]   I have a pile in my home office that's the place drones go to die.
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:52.280]   It's got really yeah.
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:57.040]   They're all it's a drone graveyard they're all this little like broken wing and stuff
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:59.200]   and I can't throw it out because it costs you know.
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:00.200]   There's a drone morgue.
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:01.200]   It's not really like a thing.
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:06.760]   I have that what do they call it the bebop drone that was supposedly uncrashable like
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:08.480]   flies itself.
[00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:10.080]   First time I took it out crash it.
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:14.800]   Now every time I turn it on it flies sideways it just immediately flops over so it's in
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:19.080]   the graveyard there but maybe you think this one you think I could I could use this one.
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:21.080]   This one has obstacle.
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:23.440]   Wait a minute it's $1299 bucks.
[00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:24.440]   That's for the full pack.
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:27.480]   It's like a thousand without the.
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:29.400]   I just ordered one mine's going to be here on Tuesday.
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.400]   They're not crashing a thousand dollar prone.
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:32.400]   It's too.
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:35.080]   Drone too much money for one flight just sell any iPads.
[00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:36.080]   You'll be fine.
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:37.080]   Yeah really that's true.
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:38.080]   There you go.
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:39.080]   Sell an iPad get a drone.
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:41.000]   Oh I've got 32 phones.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.800]   I only use two so I mean maybe I could eBay one of them you know I mean just get the drone
[00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:49.120]   and the drone fly it's like any approved it'll fly itself at the time.
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:52.600]   When we were in the Galapagos I really wish there were a few places where I would have
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:55.040]   been so amazing to have a drone.
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.960]   There's a there's something they call a le Chamelos which is the twins.
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:03.840]   It's twin sinkholes that the volcano erupted and made a bubble of lava like a thousand feet
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:06.640]   across and then that collapses and it's beautiful.
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:09.400]   I said did you ever bring a drone and said they don't let us.
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:11.280]   You can't bring a drone in here they won't let you.
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:12.280]   Oh really.
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:13.440]   But if I had this in my pocket and just went.
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:14.440]   Go really early.
[00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:19.800]   You know what my key is I go really early to these places because it's golden hour anyway
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:20.800]   right.
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:27.120]   Like five say I'm there's kind of nobody there to harass you especially if it's public places
[00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:29.040]   you know you can fly anyway.
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:32.960]   But you know what the great thing is Leo and I posted this on a couple of the photos I
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:36.440]   posted lately it's almost like having a jib like you don't have to fly.
[00:41:36.440 --> 00:41:38.440]   What up in the air to get shot.
[00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:42.440]   You can fly 20 feet up in the air and get shots that you couldn't have it's on and then
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:51.280]   move it in like you know like a jib does on you know old school sort of you know film
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:56.400]   the way film crews do and you can just get amazing shots that were never possible before.
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:42:00.000]   You don't have to do the stuff way up in the air those are awesome.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.040]   Okay okay Jason I'll start using drones at the beginning of top five.
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:06.960]   I want to.
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:08.560]   You know it's so fun.
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:12.280]   My favorite drone shot is where you do have just like a standard shot and the guy's sitting
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:16.760]   there and then all of a sudden it pans back a hundred feet 200 feet.
[00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:19.680]   Suddenly the guys this little person on a cliff.
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:20.680]   That's my favorite shot.
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:22.880]   So I want to tell you two things.
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:24.520]   One Jason again.
[00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:27.600]   I've been wanting a drone but you sent me an inspire me to do a drone because I'm like
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:29.160]   she could do it I could do it.
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:30.160]   I believe in.
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:33.160]   What do you mean what is Jason some sort of.
[00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:34.160]   Cacetic loser.
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:36.480]   He can do it I can do it.
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:40.560]   I mean I am I break him down to build him up Leo just stop.
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:44.360]   Oh and if I could do it you could do it Jason clearly knows what he's doing.
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:45.960]   You could do it Lee could do it.
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:46.960]   That's the end of that story.
[00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:48.760]   But I'm trying to tell you Jason.
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:49.760]   I'm not offended.
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:53.160]   I'm not ordered a handheld system for it.
[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:55.680]   It's called Katana DJI Mavic tray.
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:59.520]   You can actually walk around that you'll have a three access camera that you don't have
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:00.520]   to fly.
[00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:03.960]   You can just slide it in and it's got a mount for your iPad or phone over the top.
[00:43:03.960 --> 00:43:07.760]   So if you don't want to fly but you want some ground footage or shots it has a steady
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:10.880]   cam a city hands so you could use it.
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:14.880]   They also have the spark right which is another.
[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:17.440]   That's the new one that just came out the last month.
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:19.600]   Yeah and this is even smaller right.
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:21.480]   This is a mini mini drone.
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:24.640]   You can use your hands to fly that one by that one Leo you can't crash that.
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:26.200]   That's like a selfie drone.
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:27.320]   You know that's like one of these.
[00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:29.080]   Oh I can crash it.
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:31.840]   Oh don't make me die.
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:32.840]   I can crash it.
[00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:34.600]   The challenge has been issued.
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:36.160]   So how much is this one?
[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:37.560]   Six one's like half.
[00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:38.560]   Okay.
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:41.080]   That is probably a similar camera right.
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:43.120]   It is not for case 1080.
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:45.080]   It's not yeah it's not as good a camera.
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:46.960]   It's not a three access it's a two access.
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:49.320]   I'm just up on drones a little bit I did a little reset.
[00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:50.320]   Sounds like you are.
[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:52.680]   And on it you got your drone coming to see.
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:57.480]   But for that selfie shot you know that that you know jib shot it would be fine for that
[00:43:57.480 --> 00:43:58.480]   right.
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:43:59.480]   Look at.
[00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:00.480]   Oh yeah.
[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:01.480]   Absolutely.
[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:02.480]   It's got the facial right.
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:03.480]   You don't need to remote.
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:04.480]   Oh it's so it would.
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:05.480]   It sees your face and it stays on your face.
[00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:06.480]   Yeah.
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:07.480]   Use your hands to move it.
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:09.480]   Gestures make it up.
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:10.480]   Circle.
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:11.480]   What.
[00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:13.280]   Do a pan off shot just from using your hands.
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:15.120]   Like go like that and it goes like that.
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:16.120]   It goes back.
[00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:17.120]   Yep.
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:19.040]   Say this it takes a picture.
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:23.360]   What do you guys the drone whispers what do you what do this is like I feel like this
[00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:27.000]   is like the music man you know if you only fun.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   Yeah it's fun.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.080]   At the end of this Jason and oh doctor will reveal their new drone sale startup.
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:33.080]   Yeah.
[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:36.760]   Okay and this has a return to home feature.
[00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:40.640]   That's important because the first drone I ever flew and I have to say thank you to
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:44.440]   Father Robert ballis air we call him the quad father because he's like the king of drones
[00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:45.440]   around here.
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:48.920]   He said don't the first drunk in its cheapest drone you could find it was like a $40 drone
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:53.400]   because it will you'll you'll crash you the first run and Lisa saying wait till we get
[00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:54.400]   home.
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:58.000]   I couldn't wait I put it on the deck and I turned it and it is I said fly up and it
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.720]   flew up and all this is so cool and then it kept flying up and I said no come back and
[00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:05.440]   it kept flying I said come back and it never came back it was like a balloon that you let
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:09.720]   go it just got to be a tiny spec and I don't know where it is.
[00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:16.320]   So at least it was only $40 but literally it's it did it did I need return to home I
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:18.840]   need a button that will say come back to the first thing I'm doing.
[00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:21.320]   I'm putting a tile on it so it leaves like a drive around.
[00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:22.320]   That's a good idea.
[00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:26.520]   Although around here you got to use a tracker if you don't mind.
[00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:27.520]   Tracker fine.
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:28.520]   Tracker is.
[00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:29.520]   We don't like the tile we like the tracker.
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:30.520]   Up tracker with a tractor.
[00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:31.960]   Tracker is a sponsor.
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:36.800]   Yeah, you know you probably do need that because when it flew up I knew well eventually
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:41.640]   it ran out of power and crashed but I had no idea where and I just said I hope it doesn't
[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:42.640]   hit anybody.
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:43.640]   The International Space Station.
[00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:45.440]   I don't know where it ended up.
[00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:49.200]   I looked around the property I looked around in the neighborhood I never saw it again I
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:51.520]   thought I don't it's somewhere but I have one.
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:53.280]   Fell down and killed a squirrel somewhere.
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:58.960]   I hope it was light but anyway so I'm a little drunged sensitive.
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:01.480]   Have we talked about a story yet today besides that?
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:02.480]   No.
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:03.480]   What happened to that?
[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:04.480]   What do you even do?
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:06.240]   I got a story I got a story for you.
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:07.240]   This is a great story.
[00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:11.640]   This is a have you ever heard the phrase neighbor spoofing?
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:12.640]   Do you know what that is?
[00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:18.840]   Do you ever get on your cell phone a phone call from your area code maybe even your exchange?
[00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:23.760]   The other day somebody called me on Monday or Tuesday and said did you just call me?
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:27.760]   And I saw a number on the caller ID 707971 same as my phone.
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:33.720]   I said no I didn't but I can guarantee you that was spam because that's what they do
[00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:34.720]   right?
[00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:38.760]   They use your phone number and lately they've been using your exchange called neighbor spoofing.
[00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:40.320]   It's illegal.
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:41.720]   Yeah.
[00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:46.120]   And I think they got the guy who's doing it.
[00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:57.120]   The FCC is proposing a $120 million fine for a Miami man named Adrian Abramovich.
[00:46:57.120 --> 00:47:03.440]   So this according that I just stick the word allegedly in a few times because I don't want
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:09.920]   to you know allegedly what this guy was doing is making robo calls.
[00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:11.000]   These are marketing robo calls.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:17.040]   He was selling time shares and what the call would come in you would answer and would say
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:19.600]   I'm calling from a well-known name Marriott.
[00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:25.240]   I got that one many times or Hilton or Expedia TripAdvisor and it says press one to hear
[00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:28.200]   more about exclusive vacation deals.
[00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:32.240]   Then you'd get routed to a call center that had nothing to do with those big name brands
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:35.440]   where they try to get you to buy a time share.
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:37.400]   TripAdvisor got one of this.
[00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:39.840]   They launched their private investigation.
[00:47:39.840 --> 00:47:41.880]   They traced the calls back to Abramovich.
[00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:48.040]   He was in Miami, Florida at a gated community in coconut Grove.
[00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:50.760]   And they turned all this information over to the FCC.
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:56.120]   The FCC's got his call records in December of last year.
[00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:57.120]   They got three months.
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:58.120]   That's all they got.
[00:47:58.120 --> 00:47:59.400]   Three months of call records.
[00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:08.120]   In three months he had made 96,758,223 robo calls.
[00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:12.080]   More than a million a day.
[00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:19.240]   Every one of them spoofing your area code so that you would go oh it must be a neighbor.
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:20.240]   It must be the school.
[00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:23.400]   It must be somebody important and you would answer it.
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:25.400]   And I did the first 20 times it happened.
[00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:28.000]   Eventually I figured out this is not.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.360]   So you bought a time share?
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:33.000]   Well it's a nice time share and I can't wait to bring it.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.400]   I know he just came back from vacation.
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:36.840]   It's in a gated community in coconut Grove.
[00:48:36.840 --> 00:48:37.840]   Let's go get a crow.
[00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:41.080]   I get five minutes just to just admit what happened.
[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:42.960]   You got got and that's what happened.
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:45.240]   He just came back from the time share of the occasion.
[00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:46.240]   We know what happened.
[00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:48.200]   It didn't matter if you were on the do not call registry.
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:49.840]   He wasn't paying any attention to that.
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:52.720]   It didn't matter that this kind of spoofing is illegal.
[00:48:52.720 --> 00:48:55.280]   He didn't pay attention to that allegedly.
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:49:00.000]   Anyway the FCC after getting those records has now proposed.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:03.120]   I'm not sure what it takes to actually find him but have proposed.
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:07.040]   So he has 30 days to respond is what that means.
[00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:09.880]   And that gives him an extra 30 million calls he could make.
[00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:10.880]   Yeah right.
[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:11.880]   What do you think is the sex rate?
[00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:14.280]   Is you think the sex rate is like 10%?
[00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:20.880]   Yeah well let's say it's 1% 1% of a million is a thousand times shares.
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:21.880]   Is that right?
[00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:22.880]   No 10,000.
[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:24.800]   That's what I'm trying to hold on.
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:26.320]   I got some quads out here.
[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:27.320]   How many?
[00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:28.320]   Do the math.
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:30.880]   No they say we can't do it without Python.
[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:31.880]   We need Python.
[00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:35.240]   He could have absolutely made about 300 million dollars.
[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:36.640]   Oh I'm sure he made it.
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:37.640]   Oh I'm sent.
[00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:39.440]   As in time share.
[00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:40.440]   No.
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:42.800]   Yeah I mean so let me never mind.
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:43.800]   I'm gonna go.
[00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:45.600]   I got it.
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:46.600]   I got it.
[00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:47.960]   It's really easy to do right.
[00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:49.800]   You can spoof phone numbers very easily.
[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:52.120]   You get that fast Windows machine now.
[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:53.520]   Oh and you do it.
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:55.480]   All day, every day.
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:56.920]   I hope this is the end of that.
[00:49:56.920 --> 00:50:00.720]   But just so you know that's the new term neighbor spoofing.
[00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:01.720]   It is illegal.
[00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:05.640]   I'm not sure if it's illegal because you're spoofing the call or number or because you're
[00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:07.600]   spoofing it from your area code.
[00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:09.160]   Probably both.
[00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:12.240]   But the FCC maybe got them.
[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:15.600]   We'll keep you posted on that story.
[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:16.600]   Other Apple news.
[00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:17.600]   Apple quietly.
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:22.320]   Without a lot of fanfare announced a new tier on Apple music.
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:28.200]   There's a $99 a year plan.
[00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:30.720]   This is gonna discount for penny year in advance.
[00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:33.840]   That makes it what about a little more than eight bucks a month.
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:34.840]   That's a pretty good deal.
[00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:36.720]   You say 20 bucks, 22 bucks.
[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:39.840]   Does that mean they're struggling?
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:42.960]   It's a good way to lock in.
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:43.960]   Good business subscriptions.
[00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:45.800]   Is that the family plan?
[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:48.640]   No and so that's the family plans 15 bucks a month.
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:50.040]   So they didn't really announce it.
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:55.720]   You just have to go to the Apple music membership and see individual one year, 99 bucks.
[00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:56.720]   Students by the way, 49.
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:59.120]   That's why it's attrition is what that does.
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:00.120]   Right.
[00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:01.120]   Yeah.
[00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:02.120]   You know what?
[00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:03.120]   I see that more and more on subscription sites.
[00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:05.520]   They offer a year plan.
[00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:10.280]   And that actually a lot of times I fall for it because it's like, well, it's so much cheaper.
[00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:12.280]   And then I never use it, right?
[00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:13.280]   But they got you for a year.
[00:51:13.280 --> 00:51:15.760]   Yeah, once you pay for it, that's exactly how they get you.
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:16.760]   But only once a year.
[00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:17.760]   I love the Apple music.
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:18.760]   I love it.
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:19.760]   I love it.
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:23.080]   But you don't think about it because it renews automatically and you forget.
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:24.680]   You'll get an email.
[00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:26.600]   They always send you an email that your subscriptions are doing.
[00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:28.520]   So if you're doing a monthly, you get an email once a month.
[00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:29.680]   You probably don't do anything about it.
[00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:31.520]   But you get 12 opportunities yearly.
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:32.520]   There's only one.
[00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:33.520]   Right.
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:36.680]   It's it's much less chance that people will cancel.
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:37.840]   Yep.
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:38.840]   Did you see the video?
[00:51:38.840 --> 00:51:42.320]   But I have to say, we had John Markoff on triangulation.
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:48.320]   Of course, he is retired from the New York Times, one of the great tech journalists and
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:52.600]   took a job as historian at the Computer History Museum.
[00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:57.920]   Did an amazing interview with some of the original iPhone team members, including Hugo
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:02.400]   Fine, Night in Gennattra, Scott Hertz, and then an interview with Scott Forstall talking
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:06.400]   about the iPhone and Apple.
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:10.360]   And thank you, fortunately Renee Ritchie watched the whole video.
[00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:14.280]   And I started and I didn't get through the whole thing, but he gave us some highlights.
[00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:21.360]   So one of the reasons the iPhone exists, Steve Jobs hated a guy at Microsoft who claimed
[00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:22.360]   that their tablet PC.
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:23.360]   Remember the tablet PC?
[00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:24.360]   I got one in 2000.
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:25.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:31.920]   Remember Microsoft at Comtex took over the parking lot, put a house there like like out
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:36.640]   of the Wizard of Oz just dropped a house in the parking lot at the Las Vegas Convention
[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:41.800]   Center and put these stepford clone people like there was the kid in the kids bedroom
[00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:45.600]   and there was mom in the kitchen and there was dad in the living room and they all had
[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:48.880]   these windows tablets, but it was 2000.
[00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:50.880]   So what was that windows XP?
[00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:53.360]   Yeah, it was XP.
[00:52:53.360 --> 00:52:54.680]   Horrible.
[00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:56.120]   And Bill Gates was all in.
[00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:57.200]   Remember on tablets?
[00:52:57.200 --> 00:53:00.760]   So apparently Steve hated these so much.
[00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:03.440]   He came into the office at Apple said it's all wrong.
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:04.880]   The stylus is wrong.
[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:06.320]   He said, let's do fingers.
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:08.600]   Let's do multi touch.
[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:11.920]   And at first they were going to do a tablet.
[00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:15.880]   In fact, one of these guys I think Hugo talks about going into a room once he was hired
[00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:18.760]   for the iPhone team in this was 2005.
[00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:23.560]   It goes into a room where the giant computers hook up to this with these big wires to this
[00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:28.520]   big thing, this tablet and they've got it all the scrolling and everything.
[00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:31.920]   They didn't think about phone at first.
[00:53:31.920 --> 00:53:36.840]   And the fact that everybody on the team hated their phones made Steve come in and said,
[00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:40.040]   can you take the demo of the tablet and could you make it a phone?
[00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:42.560]   Could you put it something you could fit in your pocket?
[00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:44.280]   And they did it.
[00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:47.680]   So they put the tablet on hold and they started working on a phone.
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:51.600]   That was about two years before the iPhones release.
[00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:53.120]   Apple investigated all sorts of ways.
[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:55.600]   And this was, well, I remember when they were talking first talking about an iPhone, I said,
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:57.240]   you don't want to get in this business.
[00:53:57.240 --> 00:54:00.200]   These guys are, these self guys are terrible.
[00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:06.120]   Apple talked about buying spectrum, about doing an MVNO, about partnering.
[00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:09.880]   They started meetings according to the interviews.
[00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:15.080]   Carriers thought of manufacturers, these guys are the scum of the earth.
[00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:17.880]   So they gave Apple pages and pages of requirements.
[00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:23.720]   Finally, they got singular at the time, which later became AT&T to agree.
[00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:27.840]   Yeah, because they were in trouble.
[00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:33.280]   And Apple said, we're going to do it, but we're not going to do what you're going to
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:35.360]   do it by our rules.
[00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:37.680]   Because of us, we'll market it and we'll sell more.
[00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:41.440]   First all says, singular execs would keep coming in with these terrible ideas.
[00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:44.040]   Like one of them was adding a button for email.
[00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:48.240]   Why don't you have a physical button and you could press it and you get your email?
[00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:50.320]   And then Scott said, yeah, yeah, good idea.
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:52.120]   We'll think about that later.
[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:54.720]   No, blow them off.
[00:54:54.720 --> 00:55:00.480]   They also didn't want to do AT&T really dug their heels in on some of the most important
[00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:01.640]   features.
[00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:05.320]   One example was one of the Apple execs that was on the team.
[00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:07.960]   It was a really small team, the iPhone team at first.
[00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:08.960]   One of us.
[00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:16.480]   I met last year and he was saying that the whole visual voicemail, Apple was like, look,
[00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:20.120]   voicemail is people don't listen to their voice messages.
[00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:21.760]   And they're like, let's just make it visual.
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:25.920]   So you look at it like email and then people will actually look at their voice messages.
[00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:30.600]   They're like, a lot of these people can't even figure out how to get their voicemail.
[00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:34.920]   And so AT&T was like, no, we can't do it.
[00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:40.120]   It's physically impossible to do that and what you want to do isn't real.
[00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:43.280]   And they kept saying, no, look, we've shown, we've demoed it.
[00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:44.440]   We figured out how to do it.
[00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:46.440]   And they're like, no, no, that's just in your lab.
[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:49.080]   And you can't really do that at scale and all of this.
[00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:53.000]   And finally, Steve Jobs had to go to the CEO of AT&T and said, look, we're doing this
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   voicemail thing.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.920]   Just tell your people to knock it off.
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:58.320]   And that's how they got it.
[00:55:58.320 --> 00:56:05.080]   It's amazing to think about the clout that Apple had at this time, that Steve had at
[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:06.080]   this time.
[00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:13.480]   They wanted to demo the phone to singular, but they were worried about cell reception
[00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:15.200]   in Vegas, it was convegas.
[00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:18.640]   So they wanted to use Wi-Fi, but they were at the Four Seasons.
[00:56:18.640 --> 00:56:24.640]   And because the Four Seasons had one of them captured portals, you had to log in through
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:27.360]   and pay for, they were worried about that whole process.
[00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:30.120]   So they called the Four Seasons.
[00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:31.520]   Four Seasons says, I couldn't mention Apple.
[00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:33.880]   I couldn't say anything about Steve Jobs.
[00:56:33.880 --> 00:56:36.520]   So I pretended to be a singular executive.
[00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:37.520]   I needed to do a demo.
[00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:40.400]   Can you make sure the Wi-Fi is free?
[00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:43.360]   And the Four Seasons said, well, it's four seasons of Man and Light Bay.
[00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:46.840]   We can't, you'd have to make it free for everybody in the hotel.
[00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:48.880]   They said, good, could you do that?
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:50.720]   You're the Four Seasons, you can do it.
[00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:52.280]   And they did it.
[00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:53.280]   So they did the demo.
[00:56:53.280 --> 00:56:57.280]   A couple of days later, the IT guy from the Four Seasons calls and says, can I turn
[00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:59.040]   charging back on now?
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:01.680]   Yes, thank you.
[00:57:01.680 --> 00:57:03.640]   You can.
[00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:06.640]   So kind of, I do recommend the video.
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:07.880]   I've been watching it in chunks.
[00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:08.880]   It's fairly long.
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:12.240]   But, and by the way, Kudos to John Markoff.
[00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:17.160]   It's really great to see him and continuing really in his role as a, as explainer of
[00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:21.160]   tech, but I think in a great venue, the Computer History Museum.
[00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:22.160]   Got him talking about Scumor.
[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:23.160]   That's awesome.
[00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:24.160]   That's a few more.
[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:25.160]   That's a few more.
[00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:26.160]   Yeah.
[00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:27.160]   Oh, man.
[00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:28.160]   Tell me about that.
[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:29.160]   Because that's-
[00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:32.360]   Well, I mean, basically said, why did you, why did you do that, Scott?
[00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:33.360]   Yeah.
[00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:37.200]   And not to get too far into it, but he's like, we wanted to make iOS approachable and easy
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:38.200]   to use.
[00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:41.200]   And we thought that would help if people saw things they recognized.
[00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:46.560]   The other day I saw a, I, I had an original iPad, which you can't update.
[00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:49.480]   So it had the old Scumorific icons on it.
[00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:50.480]   Yeah.
[00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:52.880]   And like next to mine, it was like, ooh.
[00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:56.760]   It was thought that was a good idea.
[00:57:56.760 --> 00:58:00.600]   It's one of those things that, I mean, technology, we evolve.
[00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:03.880]   And then we think like everything that was before is bad, right?
[00:58:03.880 --> 00:58:10.040]   Like, and the thing is, is at the time it had a, it had a good purpose.
[00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:11.920]   It served its purpose.
[00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:13.920]   And you know, we moved on from that.
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:18.000]   But that doesn't mean that everything, you know, was, was terrible.
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:21.800]   We have, and some of this is a little bit of an American thing too, right?
[00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:25.560]   We're so future oriented that we look back and we, some of the things that we'd like
[00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:29.520]   to laugh at ourselves or the things we did or particularly we love laughing at others
[00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:32.080]   and the things they created that we think are terrible.
[00:58:32.080 --> 00:58:38.000]   But, but you know, those things did, I mean, I kind of, I kind of got what, what he was
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:39.000]   saying.
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:42.560]   It did change my perspective on it a little bit because I was one of the ones who didn't
[00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:46.800]   love all the, you morphic kind of things.
[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:49.040]   It made sense when he explained it.
[00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:50.040]   It did.
[00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:51.040]   It did.
[00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:52.800]   It made sense that, you know, look, there were a lot of people that could barely figure
[00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:54.040]   out how to use their phones.
[00:58:54.040 --> 00:58:59.000]   I mean, I remember trying to give people a windows phone and a blackberry and try to
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:03.640]   say, yeah, find the internet or try to make a call and most people figure out.
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:06.040]   And the internet was the planetary button in the middle.
[00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:07.040]   Come on, bro.
[00:59:07.040 --> 00:59:11.000]   Let's not forget though that it, I mean, take out your phone right now and, and, and look
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:14.320]   at the icon to make a phone call.
[00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:15.560]   What does it look like?
[00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:17.560]   A handset, something, I don't know.
[00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:20.400]   I haven't used a handset in a long, long time.
[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:21.400]   Right?
[00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:22.800]   I mean, where's the email button?
[00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:23.800]   Yeah.
[00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:24.800]   Yeah.
[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:25.800]   Yeah.
[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:30.960]   Although if you have a Samsung S8, you do have a Bixby button.
[00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:32.240]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:33.920]   Which is the dopiest thing ever.
[00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:35.560]   By the way, they've, I got a demo.
[00:59:35.560 --> 00:59:41.760]   Florence Ion was on the new screensaver yesterday and she's installed the Bixby beta software
[00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:48.360]   that finally gives Bixby the voice assistant on the new Samsung Galaxy S8 a voice.
[00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:52.960]   And so, because up to now I press the button, wait about a minute because it really is
[00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:57.880]   slow and it would put up a kind of Google now style set of cards, your calendar, the
[00:59:57.880 --> 00:59:59.640]   weather, that kind of thing.
[00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:05.560]   But pretty soon, I guess Samsung, apparently the problem was they did it in Korean and she
[01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:09.160]   played for me the Korean voices by the way, which don't sound robotic at all.
[01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:14.560]   And somebody who's a Korean speaking speaker in our chat room said that it was very natural,
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:16.080]   very real setting.
[01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:18.080]   The American voice still sounds a little bit robotic.
[01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:23.240]   But apparently it was more difficult for them to get from Korean Bixby to American English
[01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:24.640]   Bixby.
[01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:26.400]   That by the way is the only version that will be available.
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:29.480]   It is the only version currently available in this beta.
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:31.640]   It also isn't really Google assistant.
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:33.760]   It isn't really anything like Siri.
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:34.960]   It's not about the outside world.
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:36.560]   It's much more about using the phone.
[01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:42.480]   But she showed me, you can actually say, open this image, crop this image, speak to the
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:45.080]   phone and then the phone will pull up the dialogue in that.
[01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:49.760]   So it's almost like an accessibility feature where you could talk to the phone and have
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:50.760]   it do stuff.
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:56.640]   Oh, the thing I had to do was 3.1 where I could just tell it read the labels and go
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:58.600]   from one note over to the audience.
[01:00:58.600 --> 01:00:59.600]   Kind of like that.
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:00.600]   Everything old.
[01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:04.600]   You know, I just, when I hear Bixby, I wanted to have a British accent, something about
[01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:05.840]   that makes me feel like.
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:06.840]   Because it's called Bixby.
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:07.840]   Yeah, something.
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:09.840]   Yeah, yeah, I can see that.
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:13.360]   It should be called Jeeves and it should sound like Stephen Fry.
[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:14.360]   It's clear.
[01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:15.360]   I'm a successor.
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:17.080]   I can't do that.
[01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:18.080]   Yes.
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:20.480]   Perhaps I should check the internet for you today.
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:22.680]   Yeah, you know, that's a good phone.
[01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:24.880]   Like, I really, it is a good phone.
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:27.880]   The Bixby button's dopey, but in other respects, it's fine.
[01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:28.880]   It's true.
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:29.880]   Exactly.
[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:31.960]   I feel like they still are trying to do software.
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:36.360]   Maybe eventually they'll figure software out, but there's no signs of it so far.
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:39.760]   Most of the software they do is not good and they really should.
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:44.800]   I still feel like they should just focus on making a better Android phone and, you know,
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:48.240]   tie in hardware, you know, working on better hardware integration.
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:52.640]   If that button was a Google now button, obviously you can say, "Okay, Google."
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:54.880]   I don't really like having that thing turned on.
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:02:00.400]   And so, but if that was like an, you know, if that just turned on the Google, the "Okay
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:03.800]   Google" prompt, I do have too much happiness.
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:07.840]   Yeah, and early on, people were able to hack it to do that, but I think Samsung disabled
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:08.840]   that capability.
[01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:09.840]   Yeah.
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:10.840]   Which is a little annoying.
[01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:12.440]   You can speak to Bixby.
[01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:13.680]   You don't have to press the button.
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:16.560]   You can just say, "Hey, Bixby."
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:18.760]   And that's not Viv, which Samsung owns.
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:19.760]   It's a different--
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:20.760]   And that's the-- yeah.
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:21.760]   So the people--
[01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:22.760]   I'm wondering what the weird--
[01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:23.760]   Is that weird?
[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:24.760]   --the other shoe drops, right?
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:25.760]   Yeah.
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:27.360]   Well, so Samsung bought the phone.
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:31.480]   The guys who created Siri sold it to Apple, then left Apple, created something new called
[01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:35.120]   Viv, which is Samsung bought.
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:36.960]   My guess is it's not for the phone.
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:40.400]   It's more for an echo-style device, Tom, I would guess.
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:41.400]   Yeah.
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:45.720]   But you would think they would want it across platforms like Google and Apple are doing.
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:50.680]   Yeah, but it's weird on an Android-based phone because you already have the very good Google
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:51.680]   assistant.
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:52.680]   Sure.
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:54.160]   You don't really need it on the phone.
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:57.960]   This is the problem I have with all of these assistants right now is that even though, yeah,
[01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:02.160]   I can put Cortana on my iPhone if I want, I can't make it the default.
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:05.680]   So everything's in a world guard.
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:08.880]   I think they're probably going to put it in the TVs, honestly, probably going to be in
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:09.880]   the remote.
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:11.600]   Yeah, that kind of stuff.
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:13.320]   And that kind of thing would be my guess.
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:16.240]   But we'll see.
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:17.640]   Time will tell with all that good stuff.
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:18.640]   Do you use all that--
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:19.640]   Do you use all that--
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:21.840]   I could just see you ranting and raving at one of these devices.
[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:24.240]   Do you use an echo or anything like that?
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:27.680]   No, I don't like the government in my home uninvited.
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:30.240]   They're not listening on your echo-com.
[01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:35.480]   Look, I might trip and fall and kill myself by accident that we got a whole JFK situation.
[01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:41.320]   I have my phone and I want automated stuff, my nest and my lights and all this stuff.
[01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:43.000]   But my phone, I just click a button and I do it.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.240]   I'm not that fat that I can't just click a button.
[01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:46.920]   I have to talk out loud to do it.
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:50.200]   I can still click a physical button to get the things I need done.
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:51.960]   So I'm not an echo guy.
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:54.160]   Apple's little speaker is crap.
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:56.680]   So I'm waiting for everything to be great.
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:57.680]   So when it's super-duper great--
[01:03:57.680 --> 01:03:59.200]   Oh, you're gonna be waiting a long time.
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:00.200]   Hey, I got time.
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:01.200]   Nothing but time.
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:02.200]   You want her.
[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:04.880]   You want Scarlett Johansson to talk to you.
[01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:10.160]   Oh, if I could get somebody to love me and to care, then we don't like Donkey Kong.
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:13.200]   Somebody to be able to go order us from Bombfell.
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:15.200]   And this stuff just shows up because they care.
[01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:16.200]   You know what I mean?
[01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:17.200]   Something like that.
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:18.200]   It'd be nice if somebody does something like that for me.
[01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:20.000]   I could appreciate her.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.200]   Look, it's amazing.
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:25.680]   I don't know how you-- but your Bombfell package just arrived.
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:28.440]   Oh, so obviously somebody was listening.
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:29.440]   The beauty is now.
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:32.000]   Yeah, there we go.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:36.320]   You know, I signed up for Bombfell a long time ago when they first came out because I loved
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:38.680]   the idea.
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:41.240]   And I've been a Bombfell member for a long time.
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:47.960]   So Bombfell is an online personal styling service for men that helps you find the right
[01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:50.200]   clothes for you.
[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:55.880]   And the way it works, I went through this-- I think it was a couple of years ago.
[01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:59.400]   I was on iOS today with Sarah Lane, so that's how long ago it was.
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:04.080]   You do a questionnaire and they match you one-to-one with a dedicated stylist who then picks your
[01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:06.000]   clothes for you.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:10.040]   He will email you their selections, mine's a lady.
[01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:12.800]   And frankly, I'm glad because I don't think guys have very good taste.
[01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:15.280]   That's one of the reasons I'm doing this.
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:17.480]   And then you've got 48 hours to change it.
[01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:19.200]   This is on the email.
[01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:22.000]   And then they-- and by the way, they have every brand name.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.480]   They can go through all the brands, all the designers from all over the world, so find
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:27.080]   just the right stuff for you.
[01:05:27.080 --> 01:05:31.640]   They ship it to your door so you don't ever enter a store.
[01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:35.480]   You go through the stuff, you pay for the clothes you keep, send the rest back, you pay
[01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:36.480]   nothing.
[01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:41.560]   It's the only styling service that doesn't charge a styling fee or a subscription fee.
[01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:45.640]   And so shall I open-- now, I don't know if this is for you or it might be for me, Owen.
[01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:47.920]   The style is going to be different, I'll tell you that.
[01:05:47.920 --> 01:05:48.920]   I don't know.
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:50.600]   What would you have in your Bombfell?
[01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:52.600]   I'm a plaid guy, believe it or not.
[01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:53.600]   No plaid.
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:54.600]   Look at this.
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:55.600]   I've got nice--
[01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:56.600]   I'm a park can feel going on.
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:57.600]   See the nice chinos?
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:58.600]   Look at that.
[01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:00.520]   Oh, this is kind of a nice fabric.
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:02.040]   And the nice thing is this is in my size.
[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:06.280]   I don't have to-- you know, I could try it on, but-- but-- and by the way, if I try it
[01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:09.040]   and I don't like-- oh, I did say I want some jackets.
[01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:11.400]   I'm looking for some new jacket styles.
[01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:12.760]   Look at that.
[01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:14.880]   That is real-- this one I'm definitely keeping.
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:15.880]   Look at this.
[01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:23.240]   Let me-- this is the Thelonious Sea Christopher Knit Nappy Blazer.
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:25.040]   Okay, Thelonious?
[01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:28.280]   Thelonious, I'm going to look like a monk.
[01:06:28.280 --> 01:06:29.520]   No, that's pretty, isn't it?
[01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:30.520]   Look at that tweet.
[01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:31.520]   I like that.
[01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:32.520]   Thelonious Sea.
[01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:33.520]   Classic.
[01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:34.520]   That's a big brand.
[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:35.520]   That's a classic.
[01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:36.520]   That's a classic.
[01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:37.520]   Everybody needs to have at least one of these, right?
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:39.360]   All right, I'm keeping that.
[01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:41.800]   By the way, again, you pay for nothing you don't keep.
[01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:43.000]   Oh, here's another jacket.
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000]   Oh, this is nice too.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.640]   Oh, I'm going to be very happy.
[01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:46.800]   I'm going to be very happy.
[01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:51.760]   Let me put the Thelonious on right now while I tell you how you can get Bombfell.
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:53.760]   Just go to bombfell.com/twit.
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:57.320]   I'm going to get you 25 bucks off your first purchase.
[01:06:57.320 --> 01:07:00.800]   Get these great clothes delivered to you.
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:03.000]   Work with the stylist.
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.880]   It is the only service that doesn't charge you a fee for the stylist.
[01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:07.960]   You just pay for what you keep.
[01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:08.960]   And it makes it very easy.
[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:11.160]   There's a shipping label for the return and everything.
[01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:13.880]   It couldn't be easier to return it.
[01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:18.000]   The Thelonious Sea Linen Jack-Hard Blazer as well.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.760]   These are both from Thelonious Sea.
[01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:23.600]   And then the big star Union Classic Pocket trousers.
[01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:24.760]   Oh, I'm so excited.
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:27.120]   I'm going to put this on right now.
[01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:28.600]   Bombfell.
[01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:32.680]   I don't know what the name means, but it's easy to remember.
[01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:34.440]   An explosion of clothing.
[01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:39.400]   Those clothes are the bomb and they fell right into your lap.
[01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:40.800]   This is really nice.
[01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:41.800]   I think this will look good.
[01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:42.800]   I could wear this right now.
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:44.400]   It'll go with my outfit.
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:46.800]   25 bucks off your first purchase.
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:51.520]   Bombfell.com/twitspecialoff for just for you.
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:52.880]   Our listeners, we thank them so much.
[01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:55.200]   I think this is a brand new sponsor.
[01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:58.560]   Very glad to have them on this week in tech.
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:07:59.560]   All right.
[01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:02.040]   Meanwhile, my surface decided to go to sleep.
[01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:05.200]   So this is-- I'm going to do the thing I like so much, the windows hello.
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:07.200]   It just logged me in because it looked at me.
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:08.200]   Isn't that nice?
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:09.200]   Nice.
[01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:10.480]   I mean, I know it's not that secure.
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:11.480]   I get that.
[01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:13.560]   But it's so convenient.
[01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:15.040]   Super convenient.
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:16.040]   Yeah.
[01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:17.320]   That's secure enough.
[01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:19.280]   No one else in the studio can get this thing done.
[01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:21.080]   Lock except me.
[01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:22.080]   So--
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:23.080]   Hey, I got a story.
[01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:24.080]   Oh, sorry.
[01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:25.080]   Go ahead.
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:26.080]   Go ahead.
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:27.080]   You do yours and I'll do mine.
[01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:28.080]   OK.
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:30.760]   So it was-- because you mentioned-- sorry, it's a drone story.
[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:32.520]   But it has a point.
[01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:35.600]   You mentioned the parrot bebop was the one that you crash.
[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:36.600]   Yes.
[01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:37.600]   You're like, uncrashable drone.
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:38.600]   Yes.
[01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:43.720]   So the parrot bebop too recently came out and it has a first person view and FPV drone.
[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:49.480]   So you put like some goggles on it, but Aunt Pruitt just renewed it, reviewed it for
[01:08:49.480 --> 01:08:50.480]   Techno Public.
[01:08:50.480 --> 01:08:55.160]   It's one of the top stories on Techno Public if you go to techrepublic.com right now.
[01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:58.040]   Actually, Aunt Pruitt would be a great person for you to have on the show.
[01:08:58.040 --> 01:08:59.040]   You would really--
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:01.040]   Is she your aunt?
[01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:02.040]   No.
[01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:04.800]   His name is Anthony Pruitt, but we call him Aunt.
[01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:06.600]   It sounds like a lady.
[01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:07.600]   It sounds like Aunt-- hello.
[01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:08.600]   I'm your Aunt Pruitt.
[01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:11.040]   I'm going to stay for a week.
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:12.040]   Go and popular.
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:13.040]   All right.
[01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:14.040]   So this is--
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:17.120]   This looks just like the bebop I have.
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:21.880]   But they've updated it so that you put on the VR goggles.
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:25.200]   See, now if you really want to get sick, do that.
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:26.200]   Wow.
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:30.600]   But it also-- Aunt writes about the fact that this has a lot of interesting business use
[01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:34.520]   cases too because it's one that you can use inside.
[01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:39.600]   So think about people like architects and philosophers.
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:40.600]   Right, wandering around.
[01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:41.600]   Yeah.
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:43.200]   You can run it inside.
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:46.720]   So he's got some demos of that as well.
[01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:48.360]   See, I love the idea.
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:52.960]   You know, when they do drone racing, which is, as you might imagine, very fast, you have
[01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:54.560]   to wear VR goggles.
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:57.760]   You have to be-- the driver has to be in effect on the drone.
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:00.320]   There's no way you'd be able to pilot it remotely.
[01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:02.040]   So they wear VR goggles to do this.
[01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:05.520]   I would think that I'd have less trouble with flying--
[01:10:05.520 --> 01:10:06.520]   There's Aunt.
[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:07.520]   There's Aunt.
[01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:10.640]   I'd have less trouble flying this if I were wearing VR goggles.
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:14.280]   On the other hand, if I crash, it might really be devastating to my psyche.
[01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:16.680]   It might be imprinted on your brain.
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:17.680]   It's like too real, man.
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:22.240]   Well, maybe it trains you better that way because you don't want to crash again after
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:23.240]   that.
[01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:24.240]   Yeah.
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:25.240]   True.
[01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:26.240]   True.
[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:27.240]   Yeah.
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:28.880]   So can we get into some Amazon topics?
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:31.000]   I've been waiting to fight episode with Tom.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:32.000]   Well--
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000]   And it has come up yet.
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:38.480]   This is the one I wanted to bring up because while I'm in this news drought in South America,
[01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:47.920]   I read another story that Amazon bought whole foods for $13.7 billion.
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:51.040]   And again, I thought, what?
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:55.640]   And I couldn't wait to get back here and ask you all what you think of this.
[01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:57.280]   Amazon buys whole foods.
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:01.840]   Now there's some wags who said, I don't think this is how markets work, but who said, you
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:05.120]   know, Amazon stock went up by more than $13.7 billion.
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:06.680]   So in effect, it was free.
[01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:07.680]   Yeah.
[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:08.680]   It was a stock deal though.
[01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:12.120]   It's not really how it works, but yeah.
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:17.040]   But it certainly was a good move, at least from the point of view of the market.
[01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:19.200]   They thought, hey, this is a good acquisition.
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:20.200]   Is it?
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:23.320]   Why would Amazon buy a brick and mortar grocery store?
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:24.880]   Who wants to start?
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:26.360]   I had some struggles.
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:27.800]   Actually, I'll let you know.
[01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:28.800]   Yeah.
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:31.760]   But Tom Merrick, because apparently, Owen J.G. Stone thinks they're going to have a fight.
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:34.880]   I wanted Owen to go first so I could just take the opposite of whatever he says.
[01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:35.880]   Oh, that's Owen's technique.
[01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:36.880]   Oh, man.
[01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:37.880]   That's a good chance.
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:38.880]   That is it.
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:40.880]   See, this one, I don't like Tom.
[01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:43.760]   I'm trying to get Tom out of here.
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:44.760]   Tom, no.
[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:46.160]   But look, this was the greatest deal.
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:47.160]   No, no, man.
[01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:48.160]   Are you crazy?
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:49.760]   You know how awesome this is?
[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:50.760]   Okay.
[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:52.320]   Why is this a good deal?
[01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:53.320]   Let's hear it.
[01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:59.160]   First of all, Whole Foods, aka Whole Paychecks, has done the marketing research and they only
[01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:00.760]   are in rich environments.
[01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:04.920]   Those people are the people that can afford to pay Amazon to deliver and or pick up and
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:08.640]   or drop off their expensive groceries because regular people won't do it.
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:13.560]   So taking an Acme or a ShopRite or Lion or whoever grocery stores are going to help you.
[01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:16.320]   This is a national food grocery store.
[01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:18.560]   So get coast to coast, Key West to Key Largo.
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:21.480]   There's a bunch of benefits to Key West to Key Largo.
[01:12:21.480 --> 01:12:23.480]   That's both in the same state.
[01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:25.520]   It's just what I'm saying.
[01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:27.240]   It sounds good, though.
[01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:29.400]   Question what I'm saying.
[01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:31.040]   Just listen to what I'm saying.
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:32.040]   Okay.
[01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:34.360]   Anyway, it's great for them.
[01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:38.240]   Because they have many markets in certain areas that are affluent areas to test their
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:41.840]   whole pantry system and food that they're trying to sell.
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:44.160]   Key West to Key Largo is like 10 miles.
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:48.880]   Why are you just asking 32 things in five seconds to use the pump?
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:50.120]   You went to Key Largo.
[01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:51.560]   Shut up and look, it sounds good, though.
[01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:52.560]   I like it.
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:53.560]   Go ahead.
[01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:55.160]   This is a smart dinosaur.
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:58.960]   Most companies, Blockbuster sat there and watched Red Box eat their lunch.
[01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:02.160]   They watched Netflix eat their lunch and they didn't do anything.
[01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:06.400]   Amazon is the end all be all of retail selling.
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:11.680]   And this is a strong foothold coast to coast San Francisco to Miami.
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:17.080]   That's why I told them expand their grocery brand that they are obviously moving forward
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:18.080]   to.
[01:13:18.080 --> 01:13:20.120]   They're probably going to scale back on the high price items.
[01:13:20.120 --> 01:13:21.240]   But it's a great move for them.
[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:25.160]   And it gives them a foothold in something that they bought, quote unquote, on the cheap.
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:27.000]   They quote unquote, God for free.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.000]   It's great.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000]   It wasn't that cheap.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.160]   I mean, by far the largest acquisition.
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:34.320]   But next biggest one is like zappos for two billion.
[01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:37.800]   It's expensive to me as cheap to you, Uncle Leo, it ain't nothing but a bang.
[01:13:37.800 --> 01:13:38.800]   That's true.
[01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:39.800]   You see what I'm saying?
[01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:40.800]   Jeff Bezos, what does he make?
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:43.520]   Somebody say he makes like $10 million a day.
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:45.040]   So I guess he could afford it.
[01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:46.520]   Yeah, he could cash on hand.
[01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:48.240]   Yeah, they could afford it.
[01:13:48.240 --> 01:13:49.240]   Why does this?
[01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:50.240]   Doesn't that?
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:51.240]   I think this is.
[01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:53.720]   I disagree with anything that Owen is saying.
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:59.040]   The thing that I was saying about Whole Foods was they were their profit margins have been
[01:13:59.040 --> 01:14:00.040]   degrading.
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:02.440]   They've been in trouble a little bit in trouble, right?
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:03.440]   They're not.
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:07.560]   They've been fending off a little bit of activist investor pressure.
[01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:15.400]   So this was a way for them to make an exit to somebody who can absorb that pressure and
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:19.080]   not worry about it because Amazon runs on thin margins all the time.
[01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:26.120]   Amazon just made Amazon fresh, fresh again, because they get a presence like Owen saying
[01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:30.760]   in all of these different markets and they get brick and mortar outlets that they can
[01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:33.000]   use as distribution for that.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:37.760]   The problem is Instacart has a five year deal with Whole Foods.
[01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:42.200]   So they're going to have to figure out what to do to either break that deal or coexist
[01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:44.960]   with Instacart delivering Whole Foods for five years.
[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:49.080]   And Instacart's out there immediately saying Amazon is a threat to every other grocery
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:50.080]   store.
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:52.440]   You want to sign up with us right now.
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:15:01.240]   Is this though, I mean, it seems like that assuming that this is a deal about Amazon delivering
[01:15:01.240 --> 01:15:07.760]   groceries to its customers seems like it's less than it really is.
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:10.440]   It feels like there's more to this than just that.
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:12.000]   Oh, more than just that.
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:13.000]   Yeah.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:17.320]   And I think they obviously want to jumpstart the same thing they've been doing with the
[01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:21.800]   brick and mortar book retail stores and then been a lot of rumors that they were thinking
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:26.600]   about doing electronics outlets and they have that Amazon Go convenience store.
[01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:30.640]   So they may be if they can get the Kings worked out, think of bringing that kind of technology
[01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:35.320]   into the Whole Foods outlets to make them super high tech places to shop.
[01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:39.040]   So yeah, I don't think it's just about delivery, but that's the big early win for them.
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:43.400]   It's funny because Ben Thompson has been Thompson points out in the Stretecory.
[01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:49.040]   It was only two years ago that Whole Foods CEO John Mackie predicted that groceries would
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:52.560]   be Amazon's Waterloo.
[01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:55.080]   So if you can't beat him, buy him.
[01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:56.080]   Yeah.
[01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:57.240]   Here's how I think of this deal.
[01:15:57.240 --> 01:16:02.080]   And Larry Dignan on ZeeDeeNet has, you know, my colleague has written really smartly about
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:03.080]   it.
[01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:06.360]   He watches this stuff and he's pretty skeptical too.
[01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:08.200]   He's pretty bullish on it as well.
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:11.520]   And obviously we've talked about it a lot, but here's kind of how I think of this.
[01:16:11.520 --> 01:16:17.440]   There's a real similarity that Whole Foods and Amazon have in that Whole Foods was struggling
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:23.240]   because all of these grocers were carrying the same products that Whole Foods carries,
[01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:28.880]   a lot of them, not all of them obviously, but they were carrying and they were starting
[01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:37.400]   their own brands to do all of these same kind of organics, clean eating kind of products.
[01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:42.960]   And that was slowly siphoning off more of Whole Foods business.
[01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:46.880]   Amazon had its biggest threat.
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:53.640]   I mean, let's be honest, Amazon is such a monster right now in the US last year in the
[01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:58.840]   holiday sales, which is when everybody makes all of their money in the fourth quarter.
[01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:03.520]   Amazon owned like 40% of the holiday gift market.
[01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:10.200]   The next closest competitor I believe was Best Buy in the low single digits, like 3% to
[01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:11.200]   4%.
[01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:12.200]   Right?
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:17.480]   But who wants to buy milk and eggs and bread online?
[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:18.880]   I don't understand.
[01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:21.120]   Leo, it's not that.
[01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:22.440]   It's what they're going to do.
[01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:28.320]   So their threat, the biggest threat for Amazon was all of the clicks, the brick and mortar,
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:32.600]   some of the bigger click and mortar ones, you know, getting smarter about online.
[01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:33.880]   They are getting smarter.
[01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:36.440]   Their general transformation efforts are happening.
[01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:39.160]   Walmart is probably the biggest threat to Amazon, right?
[01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:40.160]   Walmart.
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:41.160]   Yeah.
[01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:42.160]   Walmart realized.
[01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:43.800]   Amazon is the biggest threat to Walmart.
[01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:45.640]   Walmart is doing a history fit right now.
[01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:48.080]   Walmart is out here trying to do mafia style stuff.
[01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:49.680]   Oh, you shopping at Walmart?
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:51.400]   Then you don't want to come over here?
[01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:53.040]   They're doing weird stuff.
[01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:57.400]   They're encouraging their partners to pull out of AWS and move to like Azure or something
[01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:58.400]   else.
[01:17:58.400 --> 01:17:59.400]   Yeah.
[01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:00.400]   Isn't that wild?
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:01.400]   Yeah.
[01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:02.400]   That's the brand old stuff.
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:03.400]   That's mafia.
[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:08.680]   If you want to continue to do business with us, you probably want to reconsider your relationship
[01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:09.680]   with Amazon.
[01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:13.320]   I'm not saying that's going to happen, but you might not walk again.
[01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:16.840]   Well, when they saw this, right?
[01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:18.760]   Walmart flipped out because they.
[01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:20.920]   So they see this as a threat.
[01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:22.600]   Oh, big time.
[01:18:22.600 --> 01:18:28.400]   And let me answer your question because, as you know, I am affiliated with local UPS stores,
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:30.120]   family, business, blah, blah, blah.
[01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:36.840]   But we get a lot of Amazon pantry orders coming through and I see them more frequently
[01:18:36.840 --> 01:18:37.840]   than not.
[01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:41.800]   People, they're not yet getting their milk and eggs, but they are getting their noodles
[01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:42.800]   and toilet paper.
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:45.200]   No, we ordered so-called dry goods.
[01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:48.400]   We ordered Lisa orders from Safeway Online.
[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:53.440]   She goes to the website and gets the chips and soda, what dry goods from Safeway.
[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:54.440]   The guy comes in the truck.
[01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:56.000]   You can't tip him.
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.480]   He just delivers it and it's very convenient.
[01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:01.880]   And then for, but I think don't people want to squeeze the melons.
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:06.480]   I mean, if you're going to buy fresh food, don't you want to go to the store?
[01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:11.720]   If you're in whole food areas and markets, there are people who don't want to squeeze
[01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:12.720]   anything.
[01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:15.320]   They just want to show up and have their stuff in their fridge and they've got the money
[01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:16.320]   to do it.
[01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:18.120]   Mark the higher people to squeeze melons.
[01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:19.120]   Yes.
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:22.480]   You know, actually, we were talking about this on this week in Google and Stacy pointed
[01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:29.880]   out one of our sponsors, Blue Apron has demonstrated that you can have a food delivery where the
[01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:31.080]   produce is perfect.
[01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:34.000]   It's never there is never a bruised anything.
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:36.720]   It's always it's better than I would get at the grocery store.
[01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:39.080]   It's always like beautiful.
[01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:45.480]   And so there is a clear example of and maybe as people then you get the confidence, oh,
[01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:47.160]   this is always going to be great.
[01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:49.080]   Why do I need to squeeze the melon?
[01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:50.160]   Let some guy do that.
[01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:53.160]   And that's another something we don't know how to squeeze the melon and it will bath
[01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:54.160]   fruit anyway.
[01:19:54.160 --> 01:19:55.560]   No, that's really true.
[01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:57.560]   That's actually really, really true.
[01:19:57.560 --> 01:20:01.040]   I knock on the watermelon, but I don't know what I'm listening for.
[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:06.360]   I see the grocery shopping in our house and if I don't, Eileen would just order it.
[01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:07.800]   She's like, I don't have time for that.
[01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:08.800]   I'm not going to go.
[01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:10.320]   But you do it now and this is important.
[01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:12.160]   You do it as an aesthetic experience.
[01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:13.160]   I do.
[01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:17.080]   I do it because it gets me out of the house and I enjoy walking around.
[01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:21.160]   Yeah, actually you're a bad example because your whole job is in your living room.
[01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:22.160]   Exactly.
[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:25.600]   So that's a bad example, but usually, but somebody who works nine to five in a real office
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:27.080]   outside of the place.
[01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:28.400]   Do you let me ask you?
[01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:30.040]   Do you want to go shop?
[01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:31.040]   Do you want to do with that?
[01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:33.240]   Or we got a couple here.
[01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:34.480]   They work in the finance industry.
[01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:35.680]   They live in Greenwich Village.
[01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:36.680]   They're the perfect.
[01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:41.760]   This is what you are the Amazon dream couple, right?
[01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:43.240]   Do you shop?
[01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:44.640]   It's hard in Manhattan, isn't it?
[01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:47.640]   They're living next door to a grocery store.
[01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:49.120]   That's bad.
[01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:51.080]   But I have to say, the grocery store is in Manhattan.
[01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:52.080]   There's two kinds.
[01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:54.800]   There's super convenient stores, right, where they just go in and you can get it.
[01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:56.400]   And then there's Zay bars.
[01:20:56.400 --> 01:21:01.960]   There's the really upscale, nice where you want to go because of the experiential.
[01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:02.960]   It's an experience.
[01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:04.440]   I think Whole Foods is kind of more on that.
[01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:09.400]   In fact, there are a lot of things, but the Whole Foods in Austin, they have like a DJ
[01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:12.800]   bar and they have like it's an experience.
[01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:13.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:21:13.800 --> 01:21:14.800]   Because that's the headquarters, right?
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:16.800]   They don't want to make it knock it out.
[01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:17.800]   Yeah.
[01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:26.000]   This gets back down to what Owen was to Owen's point is that Whole Foods retail, you know,
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:31.040]   this is retail groceries in this case, is all about location, right?
[01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:39.520]   And Whole Foods has scouted out and taken some of the best locations across the US.
[01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:40.520]   Sure.
[01:21:40.520 --> 01:21:41.520]   And there's a--
[01:21:41.520 --> 01:21:42.520]   There's a Starbucks grocery store.
[01:21:42.520 --> 01:21:43.520]   Yeah.
[01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:44.520]   From Palm Beach to Key West.
[01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:45.520]   There's everywhere.
[01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:49.320]   There's a logistical angle to this, right?
[01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:54.400]   Because Amazon just bought some prime real estate on top of things.
[01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:55.400]   And this--
[01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:56.400]   I'm going to hear about that.
[01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:57.400]   Where do they buy this real estate?
[01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:58.400]   Whole Foods stores.
[01:21:58.400 --> 01:21:59.400]   All stores.
[01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:00.400]   Oh, of that.
[01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:01.400]   Yeah.
[01:22:01.400 --> 01:22:02.400]   Now, that's a good question.
[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:06.560]   I remember I watched the movie about McDonald's and the insight that McDonald's had in this
[01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:09.800]   movie founder, the insight they had was, "Hey, we're not in the food business, we're in
[01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:13.320]   the real estate business because we own this very valuable land."
[01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:16.200]   Are all the Whole Foods, they're not leasing that property they own?
[01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:17.200]   I see that.
[01:22:17.200 --> 01:22:19.920]   Yeah, that's what I don't know how many of them are leased and how many of them are owned.
[01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:24.040]   But I know many of them are owned and they have warehouse distribution network, Amazon's
[01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:28.600]   buying planes and boats and all kinds of things to tweak their logistical network.
[01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:33.760]   Yeah, but if Whole Foods couldn't make a run at it, in other words, if they're in financial
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:36.400]   trouble, what is Amazon bringing to the table that changes that equation?
[01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:38.080]   I told you three times already.
[01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:39.760]   Why is everybody listening but you?
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:40.760]   They all get it.
[01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:43.400]   They have brought Amazon pantry.
[01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:45.400]   They have brought billions of people with prime--
[01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:46.960]   I'm still stuck on Key West to--
[01:22:46.960 --> 01:22:47.960]   Key business.
[01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:48.960]   Key Largo.
[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:50.800]   Look, you stay off my coast to coast to--
[01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:53.960]   Leo, I'm telling you that the bottom line is if you live in the middle of the world,
[01:22:53.960 --> 01:22:58.040]   you live in New York City and you're in Harlem and you're on a walk up on the fifth floor,
[01:22:58.040 --> 01:23:02.160]   you want Whole Foods delivering your food via Amazon, door to door.
[01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:06.480]   Do you go to the Bodega and is that a Bodega next to you or is it a nice grocery store next
[01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:08.760]   to you?
[01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:10.160]   You want it delivered, right?
[01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:11.840]   You don't even if it's downstairs.
[01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:14.040]   But the difference is there is an aesthetic experience.
[01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:18.280]   And I think that retail, if it's going to succeed, is going to exceed-- whether it's
[01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:23.400]   a bookstore or a grocery store, a movie theater, it's going to succeed because of the experience,
[01:23:23.400 --> 01:23:25.000]   not because of the products, right?
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:31.320]   Well, and Amazon doesn't need the retail to be profitable, to make this worthwhile anymore
[01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:34.640]   than they need Amazon video, prime video to be profitable.
[01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:35.640]   Tell me about that.
[01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:37.280]   Don't they want to make money?
[01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:42.560]   Amazon's low margin, first of all, but second of all, as long as it feeds another part of
[01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:43.560]   the business.
[01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:47.120]   And that's why I say there's a logistical side of this that they might see as being worth
[01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:48.120]   it.
[01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:52.240]   There's the fact that it might tweak more people to go to the Amazon website and order Amazon
[01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:54.560]   fresh and therefore order more Amazon.
[01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:59.040]   I mean, they do all kinds of things that are lost leaders to get people into Amazon.
[01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:02.240]   I mean, Amazon's major business maybe.
[01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:05.520]   So one of the one X factor in this, because I think that's kind of what you're looking
[01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:10.720]   for, Leo, is-- and I've wondered and have wondered too-- is are they going to eventually
[01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:12.440]   get in the delivery business, right?
[01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:14.680]   Because this is their biggest rising cost.
[01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:17.600]   This is the biggest thing Wall Street has dinged them on.
[01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:21.840]   And their biggest competitor in China--
[01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:23.320]   By Doo?
[01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:24.320]   Alibaba.
[01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:25.320]   Alibaba.
[01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:27.520]   Well, by Doo, there's several of them.
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:28.520]   J.D.com.
[01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:29.520]   J.D.com.
[01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:34.400]   J.D. is probably what we would think is more like the Amazon, right?
[01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:40.400]   They, 10 years ago, J.D. made this bet that the markets there hated, the investors there
[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:41.400]   hated.
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:44.200]   They started their own delivery service.
[01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:50.000]   And 10 years later, they look like a genius because they dealt with their biggest cost.
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:51.000]   But now--
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.920]   Sure, that's why Webvan is such a huge success today.
[01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:56.720]   So, well, but there--
[01:24:56.720 --> 01:24:58.520]   Well, I mean, we've tried this.
[01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:01.360]   Peepod, Webvan, I can go on and on.
[01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:03.960]   We've tried grocery deliveries, and they failed.
[01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:10.040]   But no, think of groceries as only one part of the delivery thing, right?
[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:16.240]   So Amazon is delivering some people packages almost every day, right?
[01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:17.240]   And they've started--
[01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:18.240]   That's a good point.
[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:21.320]   If the truck's coming to you anyway, you might as well put some groceries in there.
[01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:22.320]   Exactly.
[01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:24.560]   You have your daily delivery from Amazon.
[01:25:24.560 --> 01:25:26.920]   They've already started doing this in some of the smaller markets.
[01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:29.520]   By the way, I'm just going to point out that I'm completely playing devil's advocate.
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:30.880]   I haven't been out of the house in years.
[01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:34.320]   I ordered everything, including all groceries online.
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:36.240]   I mean, he gets his clothes delivered to a people home.
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:38.240]   And by the way, is this not looking pretty nice?
[01:25:38.240 --> 01:25:39.400]   I like this jacket.
[01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:41.160]   I think this is a big upgrade.
[01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:42.160]   Very short.
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:43.320]   Can I ask a question?
[01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:46.560]   Why do they sew the pockets shut?
[01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:48.320]   You could clip them open, you know.
[01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:50.600]   Because if you put something in there, you get all rumpy.
[01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:52.080]   It won't fall apart if I--
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:53.080]   Why do they sew?
[01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:54.080]   If they sew the pockets--
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:56.920]   But those insects don't crawl in their shipping.
[01:25:56.920 --> 01:25:59.360]   Won't put 32 gadgets in there and ball it up.
[01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:01.560]   I'm looking like you got lumps in your head.
[01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:02.560]   I already--
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:03.560]   I got bulges all over.
[01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:04.560]   So you stay--
[01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:05.560]   That looks like you have any more.
[01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:07.080]   And look trim, yes.
[01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:08.080]   That's why.
[01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:09.080]   You can't be trusted.
[01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:10.080]   Don't go Leo.
[01:26:10.080 --> 01:26:11.760]   That's why they sew the pockets shut.
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:13.480]   It's like Frankenstein mouth-sucking.
[01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:14.480]   All right.
[01:26:14.480 --> 01:26:15.960]   So I'm going to tell you what Ben Thompson said.
[01:26:15.960 --> 01:26:18.600]   Because Ben is a very good, various student.
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:20.680]   We actually wanted to get him on the show to talk about this.
[01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:22.040]   He'll be on soon.
[01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:23.320]   He couldn't do it today.
[01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:28.360]   So he was talking about Mackie and how Mackie said, you know, we're going to kill Amazon
[01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:30.560]   two years later.
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:35.200]   He said, Mackie's misunderstanding is profound.
[01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:42.120]   Amazon and Jeff Bezos have their sights on being the most dominant company of all time.
[01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:44.120]   Start there and this purchase makes sense.
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:46.920]   And what he does is he actually-- this is really brilliant.
[01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:49.520]   He does the company's mission statements.
[01:26:49.520 --> 01:26:50.920]   There's three different mission statements.
[01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:56.600]   And when Amazon first started in '97, Amazon.com's objective is to be the leading online retailer
[01:26:56.600 --> 01:27:03.960]   of information-based products and services with an initial focus on books.
[01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:06.160]   That was actually a pretty accurate description, right?
[01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:11.080]   Jeff was a hedge fund manager who said, you know, he did an analysis on an online bookstore.
[01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:12.520]   And he said, yeah, it's a good business.
[01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:14.080]   I'm getting out of this hedge fund.
[01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:16.880]   The real money's in selling books online.
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:18.880]   Who knew he was right?
[01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:25.600]   Then a few years later, our vision is to be the earth's most customer-centric company
[01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:28.920]   to build a place where people can come to find and discover anything they might want to
[01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:30.440]   buy online.
[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:34.920]   The most recent drops that second clause.
[01:27:34.920 --> 01:27:40.200]   Amazon's current mission statement is very short and simple.
[01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:44.680]   We seek to be the earth's most customer-centric company.
[01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:53.640]   Ben says what they seek is to be the middleman to own every online transaction of all of
[01:27:53.640 --> 01:27:54.640]   them.
[01:27:54.640 --> 01:28:00.320]   Just to be-- Amazon's goal is to take a cut of all economic activity.
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:02.920]   And that's why I say they don't need the whole foods to be propped.
[01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:04.720]   That's a good business plan.
[01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:05.720]   Yeah.
[01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:11.160]   Let's take a cut of all online activity, all economic activity, not even online.
[01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:16.000]   Well, they've essentially done what Walmart has done in real life online.
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:18.240]   Walmart loves to go to mom and pop shops.
[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:21.240]   Like, hey, you sold 3,200 of those hats.
[01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:22.240]   Cool.
[01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:23.240]   I'll buy your IP.
[01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:24.240]   You make me 4 million.
[01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:26.040]   You never make a hat for anybody else again.
[01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:29.960]   And they just go town to town, shop to shop, buying up everything on the earth.
[01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:33.800]   And then they looked up in the sky at Amazon's looking down like, hey, brother, you ain't
[01:28:33.800 --> 01:28:34.800]   got no wings.
[01:28:34.800 --> 01:28:36.560]   We're going to be out there doing our thing.
[01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:37.560]   Y'all stay down there.
[01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:38.560]   So have fun with that.
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:40.360]   That's why I'm getting that.
[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:42.600]   What Amazon really is is a delivery company.
[01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:44.400]   They will deliver you anything you want.
[01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:45.920]   They will deliver it virtually.
[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:47.600]   They will deliver it physically.
[01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:53.960]   And so that's why I do think eventually they either buy UPS or they make their own UPS.
[01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:56.920]   And they've been-- they bought planes, right?
[01:28:56.920 --> 01:28:57.920]   Or at least planes.
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:28:58.920]   Yeah.
[01:28:58.920 --> 01:29:01.080]   These are-- this is all peripherals.
[01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:06.320]   That in order to take a cut of all economic activity, you also have to be a great online
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:07.320]   store.
[01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:08.320]   You also have to have delivery.
[01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:09.560]   You have to have all these parts.
[01:29:09.560 --> 01:29:11.800]   But this is the real goal.
[01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:17.440]   We want all economic activity to go through Amazon's cash register.
[01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:23.960]   And even if you only take one cent out of each of those transactions, that's a lot of
[01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:24.960]   crumbs.
[01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:25.960]   That's the town's point.
[01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:28.160]   They don't have to make money on the groceries, right?
[01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:29.160]   They are delivering it.
[01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:30.960]   They're going to charge you a delivery fee.
[01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:32.040]   That's what I was trying to get to.
[01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:33.600]   They sell the groceries at cost.
[01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:34.600]   Yeah.
[01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:35.600]   Yeah.
[01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:36.600]   They sell the groceries at cost.
[01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:37.600]   They charge you a $35 delivery fee.
[01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:39.400]   They're making money anyway, right?
[01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:43.240]   By the way, notice for a long time, brand was a big deal, right?
[01:29:43.240 --> 01:29:47.280]   But notice, like even with this bomb-filled jacket, yeah, the brands-- but it wasn't--
[01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:49.880]   I didn't buy it from whoever that was.
[01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:50.880]   Thelonious Monk.
[01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:51.920]   I bought it from bomb-filled.
[01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:54.000]   The brand was completely secondary.
[01:29:54.000 --> 01:29:57.480]   And I think when we buy on Amazon, increasingly the brand is secondary, right?
[01:29:57.480 --> 01:29:58.480]   Yeah.
[01:29:58.480 --> 01:30:01.040]   It is a commodity sales.
[01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:03.160]   And they don't care about brand.
[01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:07.600]   That's what the Amazon look, that echo with the screen that looks at you and says, "You
[01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:10.600]   should buy this and this and those two don't go together."
[01:30:10.600 --> 01:30:11.600]   That's all about that.
[01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:16.680]   That's all about disintermediating brand and saying, "No, you don't need to go to Nordstrom
[01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:21.680]   and look at brand-- you need to go to Amazon and we'll figure out what brand you want.
[01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:22.680]   You don't need to worry about it."
[01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:23.840]   I mean, for some things, right?
[01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:28.480]   Buying is always a very logical thing still.
[01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:30.040]   It's changing.
[01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:34.240]   I mean, do you care whether you get tied or cheer?
[01:30:34.240 --> 01:30:35.240]   Yes.
[01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:36.240]   Yes.
[01:30:36.240 --> 01:30:37.240]   Yes.
[01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:38.240]   I do.
[01:30:38.240 --> 01:30:39.240]   I do care.
[01:30:39.240 --> 01:30:40.240]   Might be a allergic to it.
[01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:42.240]   Why do you care if you get tied or cheer-ow?
[01:30:42.240 --> 01:30:46.240]   Look, first one smells better.
[01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:49.000]   One is a superior product, one is the little brother.
[01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:51.000]   If I got it for free, I wouldn't care if I'm--
[01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.960]   I don't care if you get creced or cold-gig.
[01:30:53.960 --> 01:30:54.960]   Cressed.
[01:30:54.960 --> 01:30:55.960]   I use sense of dime.
[01:30:55.960 --> 01:30:56.960]   Yes, I care.
[01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:01.120]   I take a bit of raw about brand except that you guys are just old and the new generation
[01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:02.120]   couldn't care less.
[01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:05.480]   I don't know, but that's true.
[01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:10.480]   So in China, again, Baidu was the big giant in commerce.
[01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:17.840]   They're still giant, but JD.com has come-- as that market has gotten more affluent, as
[01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:25.040]   more of the people have become middle class, they care about brand, what they've seen
[01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:26.240]   there.
[01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:30.880]   And I think it's-- most of them are young people.
[01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:35.960]   They care about brand as soon as they have the choice, right?
[01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:38.840]   And they're not just going for whatever is cheapest.
[01:31:38.840 --> 01:31:42.960]   Then all of a sudden, the story that the product tells and the brand that it's about
[01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:48.160]   means more to them than just getting it at the lowest cost, and that's why JD.com is
[01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:52.640]   exploding there, and Baidu is really challenging.
[01:31:52.640 --> 01:31:56.000]   I think you could argue that China is behind us in this regard.
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.960]   There was a good article-- where was it?
[01:31:57.960 --> 01:32:03.560]   It was at the New York Times about how people used to show their wealth and status by conspicuous
[01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:04.560]   consumption.
[01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:05.560]   I've got Louis Vuitton bags.
[01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:10.120]   I've got some fancy watch, Rolex watch.
[01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:17.200]   And now that's changing because it no longer proves anything to have a Louis Vuitton bag
[01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:18.400]   or a Rolex watch.
[01:32:18.400 --> 01:32:21.800]   It's not a status symbol because everybody's got them.
[01:32:21.800 --> 01:32:30.440]   So now you show your wealth, you show your power, you show your discernment by experiences.
[01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:34.600]   And I do think that maybe brand is big in China, but that is not necessarily a bell
[01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:35.600]   weather.
[01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:36.600]   I would say it's the opposite.
[01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:38.760]   China is a nascent consumer economy.
[01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:42.280]   Much like we were maybe in the 60s and 70s.
[01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:44.200]   This is a mature consumer economy.
[01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:45.840]   I don't think brand is important anymore.
[01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:50.880]   You just spoke about the upper echelon 1% of people.
[01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:52.920]   You can experience experiences of being that.
[01:32:52.920 --> 01:32:58.840]   The whole rest of us, the whole other 99% care about having a Samsung TV or an iPhone
[01:32:58.840 --> 01:33:04.120]   or a Samsung phone versus an insignia or RCA.
[01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:06.880]   Brand don't matter when you're broke because you get whatever you could get.
[01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:12.280]   But if you got a little bit of money, you want a Canon camera versus a Shingsong camera.
[01:33:12.280 --> 01:33:14.560]   You're talking about experiences in traveling.
[01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:16.720]   Yeah, you get to go on a vacation for two weeks.
[01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:19.120]   I'm going to lovely places that don't let you fly drones.
[01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:20.800]   I get to live through your pictures.
[01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:22.720]   Not directly in the world.
[01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:27.120]   So yes, Captain 1% that Louis Vuitton doesn't show that I'm rich because these rappers
[01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:28.880]   are just popping up everywhere with them.
[01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:30.560]   What are we going to go buy Bali?
[01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:32.160]   Let's go buy Bali.
[01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:35.600]   Like this is small percentage of people above branding right now.
[01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:37.920]   The rest of us branding still matters.
[01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:40.160]   Oh, and always the voice of the people on this show.
[01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:42.080]   And I think that article said that.
[01:33:42.080 --> 01:33:44.320]   If you saw, I saw an article similar on Hacker News.
[01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:45.800]   I don't remember where it was from.
[01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:46.800]   Yeah, that's where I saw it too.
[01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:47.800]   So it's the same article.
[01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:48.800]   Yeah.
[01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:52.280]   So it said ultimately, it said that it was only rich people that care about experience,
[01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:53.280]   poor people care about it.
[01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:56.240]   Yeah, aspirational people care about brand.
[01:33:56.240 --> 01:34:00.120]   And then once you make it and you have money, you don't care about brand as much.
[01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:03.640]   Some people write stuff like I read those articles that looking at a woman's breasts make
[01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:05.040]   you three times smarter.
[01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:07.600]   It's just a dude who wants to get all right looking at women's breasts.
[01:34:07.600 --> 01:34:09.160]   Some people just write stuff directly.
[01:34:09.160 --> 01:34:10.720]   I just saw and read it.
[01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:11.720]   Oh, there we go.
[01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:12.720]   Then there we go.
[01:34:12.720 --> 01:34:14.720]   That's a study.
[01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:20.640]   The study shows that using sex appeal in ads doesn't make your brand more memorable.
[01:34:20.640 --> 01:34:22.400]   And in fact, ultimately hurts the brand.
[01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:26.600]   But I've always thought that using sexy ads.
[01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:27.600]   Depends on the sexy ads.
[01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:29.480]   But I'm not letting somebody else squeeze my melons.
[01:34:29.480 --> 01:34:30.480]   I'm telling you.
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:31.480]   No, no.
[01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:34.000]   I just saw Amazon brings the prices down at Whole Foods.
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:35.680]   So I don't have to mortgage my house to buy groceries.
[01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:39.640]   Luis in our studio audience points out that traffic is so bad.
[01:34:39.640 --> 01:34:42.920]   And by the way, this is a funny thing wherein you travel everywhere you go.
[01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:45.160]   They say, you know our traffic is worse than anyone.
[01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:46.880]   This is the worst traffic.
[01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:49.680]   Traffic is a nightmare everywhere now.
[01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:53.600]   And that is a very good reason why you may not want to get in the car unless you live
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:55.040]   next door to Xe bars.
[01:34:55.040 --> 01:34:58.800]   You might not want to get in the car and drive to the grocery store.
[01:34:58.800 --> 01:34:59.800]   It's time consuming.
[01:34:59.800 --> 01:35:02.440]   It's expensive in a variety of ways.
[01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:05.280]   I think more and more, especially if price goes down.
[01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:07.960]   And you're right on everybody's price sensitive.
[01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:11.880]   As price goes down, if Amazon says, look, we're only going to charge you for delivery.
[01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:14.240]   We're going to-- the groceries are at cost.
[01:35:14.240 --> 01:35:19.040]   You're going to get Whole Foods quality at a Kroger's price.
[01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:21.960]   And it saves you time.
[01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:25.520]   People will give up the idea that they have to go and buy this stuff.
[01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:26.880]   And they will take it in delivery.
[01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:29.800]   And I think that the evidence is that that's the trend.
[01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:30.800]   That's where we're going.
[01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:32.480]   And Amazon wants to do, right?
[01:35:32.480 --> 01:35:33.680]   And if they keep it at cost--
[01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:35.080]   It's also the retail.
[01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:36.840]   Go ahead, Owen, and then Jason.
[01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:37.840]   Just real short.
[01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:41.360]   If they keep it at cost, they give the average person the feel of luxury.
[01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:42.360]   That's right.
[01:35:42.360 --> 01:35:46.360]   If an average person can feel like, OK, well, you know, I only make $70,000 a year, which
[01:35:46.360 --> 01:35:47.360]   is so high.
[01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:49.840]   But I'm making that much money, and I don't have to go shopping anymore.
[01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:52.800]   I can spend $35, $25, $25, $25 a month, so I'm not still delivered.
[01:35:52.800 --> 01:35:54.880]   And then they feel like they're included in that luxury.
[01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:56.920]   And that could be a big boon for that business.
[01:35:56.920 --> 01:35:57.920]   Precisely.
[01:35:57.920 --> 01:35:58.920]   Go ahead, Jason.
[01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:01.040]   Retail and location do still matter.
[01:36:01.040 --> 01:36:04.040]   I think that is-- it will matter.
[01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:09.640]   It will continue to matter if you're in a good location and people are walking home.
[01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:11.800]   Or it's on their way home.
[01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:15.360]   And they want to just stop and get something.
[01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:17.600]   Or they want to go in and squeeze the avocado.
[01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:18.600]   I love avocados.
[01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:21.240]   I'm not getting avocados delivered because I don't trust them that they're going to get
[01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:23.240]   them in the kind of--
[01:36:23.240 --> 01:36:28.200]   What if one time you got avocados-- and my god, they were perfect, better than I could
[01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:29.200]   ever find?
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:32.120]   Wouldn't you then use that service?
[01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:33.520]   I don't know if I trust them.
[01:36:33.520 --> 01:36:34.520]   I mean--
[01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:36.640]   No, you don't trust them because you haven't experienced that yet.
[01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:37.640]   But that's the point.
[01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:42.280]   I think Amazon, one of the reasons you buy whole foods is because you think you can now
[01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:47.360]   solve that problem and convince Jason Heiner that he can get perfect avocados every single
[01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:48.360]   time.
[01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:50.120]   Oh, it's true.
[01:36:50.120 --> 01:36:53.560]   But I do think that also, again, location matters.
[01:36:53.560 --> 01:36:58.440]   But I was in New York this week when I walked by, our office is not far from the Empire
[01:36:58.440 --> 01:36:59.440]   State Building.
[01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:03.120]   When I walked by the Empire State Building, I looked right across the street and I saw
[01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:08.600]   a new thing that said, "Coming opening soon, now hiring Amazon Books."
[01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:10.520]   And I really wonder what--
[01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:16.400]   I feel like more that's about data gathering than actually an intent to create bookstores.
[01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:17.400]   And showrooming.
[01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:18.400]   Well.
[01:37:18.400 --> 01:37:19.400]   And showrooming.
[01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:24.160]   That raises a very interesting point, which is that the future-- and I think that I was
[01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:27.600]   starting to get to this-- the future retail isn't purchasing.
[01:37:27.600 --> 01:37:31.960]   The future retail is experience, showrooming.
[01:37:31.960 --> 01:37:32.960]   You go there.
[01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:35.000]   It's an experience, maybe an author reads.
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:36.000]   You can browse.
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:37.000]   You can learn.
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:38.160]   You can talk to people.
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:41.240]   That's what we're going to want in stores in the future.
[01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:42.840]   And everything else just gets delivered to us.
[01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:44.480]   I still go to bookstores.
[01:37:44.480 --> 01:37:47.720]   But if they don't have the book I want, I go home and I order it on Amazon.
[01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:48.720]   It's my shameful secret.
[01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:55.640]   The best buy is also doing that thing with a startup that you get to rent items for a
[01:37:55.640 --> 01:37:57.640]   cheaper cost for a time period.
[01:37:57.640 --> 01:37:59.600]   So you get to play around with it before you buy it.
[01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:01.600]   If you want to keep it, then you pay for it.
[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:05.760]   But you get to walk out of the door with it only paying a small percentage of what I
[01:38:05.760 --> 01:38:06.760]   like.
[01:38:06.760 --> 01:38:07.760]   Doesn't Amazon do that with easy returns?
[01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:08.760]   I think that's really smart.
[01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:10.720]   Isn't that an effect what easy returns are?
[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:12.640]   Amazon had-- Zappos is a good example.
[01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:14.600]   Nobody wanted to buy shoes.
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:17.000]   Everybody has always said, "No, I can't buy shoes online.
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:18.440]   I'm going to try them on."
[01:38:18.440 --> 01:38:19.440]   So Zappos had no problem.
[01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:20.960]   Order all different sizes.
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:21.960]   Send the stuff back.
[01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:22.960]   You don't want it.
[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:24.200]   Suddenly you're trying it on home.
[01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:25.200]   That has solved the problem.
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:29.240]   And I think that they've demonstrated people will buy shoes online.
[01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:33.360]   The thing that the best buy a physical location is one, again, when you actually get to go
[01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:37.920]   in and pick up the camera versus another camera and feel it and then say, "Okay, I like this
[01:38:37.920 --> 01:38:38.920]   camera.
[01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:39.920]   I'm going to buy it and take it home."
[01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:42.200]   And then you get to buy it as much as you get to take it back in there and actually feel
[01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:43.200]   the items you're going to get.
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:44.200]   There is something to that.
[01:38:44.200 --> 01:38:45.200]   That's showroom.
[01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:46.200]   That's showroom.
[01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:47.200]   Yeah.
[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:48.200]   Yeah.
[01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:49.200]   Yes.
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:52.960]   In fact, I remember we used to have an advertiser on the radio show, Mom and Pop Camera Store
[01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:55.160]   in LA, a very nice one.
[01:38:55.160 --> 01:39:00.160]   In fact, Soot Chat and Cable, which was the great camera store in LA, these stores are
[01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:02.080]   going away because that's what people would do.
[01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:04.640]   They would go in the store, they would try it, they would get all their questions, answer
[01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:07.000]   them, they go home and they buy it online.
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.600]   And it killed these stores.
[01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:09.600]   Yeah.
[01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:11.160]   Again, that's why location still matters.
[01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:13.520]   And showrooming is a real thing.
[01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:19.880]   And Amazon, if they're driving people out of business, but those people, those businesses
[01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:23.280]   were driving demand for the products that they sell, right?
[01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:27.320]   And then they also, they recognize that they have a problem there.
[01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:36.080]   And that's why putting a location like in Amazon books on 34th Street in New York, buying
[01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:37.080]   whole foods.
[01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:38.920]   Well, it's perfect.
[01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:40.080]   You should learn more about retail.
[01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:43.400]   People want to showroom and they go buy from you anyway.
[01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:44.840]   That's exactly what you want.
[01:39:44.840 --> 01:39:48.200]   The problem was that people would go to Cable and Shoot Chat, they would look at the camera
[01:39:48.200 --> 01:39:49.400]   and then they buy it from Amazon.
[01:39:49.400 --> 01:39:53.240]   But if you go to Amazon's Cable and Shoot Chat store, you look at the camera and then
[01:39:53.240 --> 01:39:54.920]   buy it from Amazon, there's no problem.
[01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:55.920]   It's kind of sad.
[01:39:55.920 --> 01:39:58.720]   This was a 51 years in Palo Alto.
[01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:00.520]   One of the great camera stores.
[01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:01.520]   It really is.
[01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:02.520]   It's very sad.
[01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:06.120]   It's one of those things like it's natural.
[01:40:06.120 --> 01:40:10.160]   It's a natural outgrowth of capitalism, right?
[01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:16.960]   Capitalism wants to just naturally wants to aggregate wealth.
[01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:20.520]   It's just part of the way the ecosystem works, right?
[01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:26.840]   In the same way that in two centuries ago in England, they had prime a janitor because
[01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:34.760]   they were like having that concentration builds jobs, builds communities, yada yada yada.
[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:40.360]   We have the same argument interestingly enough in free market.
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:44.280]   There are a lot of trade offs with that.
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:50.240]   One of the ones in the US right now is that the number of small businesses, as much as
[01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:56.120]   we talk about entrepreneurs and we talk about startups and all of that, they've been on
[01:40:56.120 --> 01:40:58.040]   the decline for over 20 years.
[01:40:58.040 --> 01:41:01.320]   Go to your local mall if you can find one.
[01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:03.040]   Leo, I live in the suburbs.
[01:41:03.040 --> 01:41:04.040]   We got malls over the place.
[01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:05.040]   People love malls because of all the numbers.
[01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:06.040]   Yeah, no, but they're dying.
[01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:07.040]   They're dying.
[01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:08.040]   They're dying.
[01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:09.040]   My malls aren't dying.
[01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:10.040]   We out here pending these reasons.
[01:41:10.040 --> 01:41:11.040]   He's getting it.
[01:41:11.040 --> 01:41:13.960]   What a radio shack comp USA having common.
[01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:14.960]   I mean, I could JCPenney.
[01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:17.200]   My radio shack is opening back up.
[01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:19.240]   Sprint owns this is Sprint radio shack.
[01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:20.240]   They're coming back.
[01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:22.160]   Maybe they're reopening one in my town.
[01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:25.360]   If I can't buy capacitors, it ain't no radio shack.
[01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:26.360]   True story.
[01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:28.240]   Look, I got two things for you, Leo.
[01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:30.920]   One, the chat room was roasting me about 70 Ks medium.
[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:33.280]   I said it's the high medium and it's in the area of whole foods.
[01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:34.880]   Whole foods is the people that make money.
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:36.360]   So their medium is like 70 K.
[01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:38.440]   Secondly, we keep talking about real estate.
[01:41:38.440 --> 01:41:42.080]   You know the cool thing about real estate, real estate, permissive, and getting loans
[01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:43.080]   is moved online.
[01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:44.560]   Tell me something about that, Uncle Leo.
[01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:46.520]   Well, that's a very interesting question.
[01:41:46.520 --> 01:41:48.720]   I hope you've heard of Rocket Mortgage.
[01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:50.920]   Oh, tell me about it.
[01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:52.680]   Oh, and JJ Stone.
[01:41:52.680 --> 01:41:55.520]   Now you know why he's on the show, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:41:55.520 --> 01:41:57.840]   This man knows how to pitch.
[01:41:57.840 --> 01:41:58.840]   Thank you, Owen.
[01:41:58.840 --> 01:41:59.840]   Rocket Mortgage.
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:02.160]   From Quick and Loans, the best mortgage lender in the country.
[01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:04.000]   Quick and Loans.
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:05.000]   Just look at the website.
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:08.400]   You see all those JD Power Customer Satisfaction Awards year after year.
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:13.960]   The most satisfaction as a home, a loan originator, as a loan servicer.
[01:42:13.960 --> 01:42:18.080]   And now you can get your home loan from Quick and Loans through Rocket Mortgage and do it
[01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:19.920]   entirely online.
[01:42:19.920 --> 01:42:21.800]   See, the Quick and Loans saw this.
[01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:25.040]   They said the mortgage experience is not keeping up with the times.
[01:42:25.040 --> 01:42:26.240]   It's dated.
[01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:30.440]   It's like you're going to the 19th century with some guy with an eye shade and sleeve
[01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:32.920]   garters is like a quill pen.
[01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:33.920]   You want a loan?
[01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:35.360]   I can get you a loan.
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:37.480]   This isn't, this is actually true.
[01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:41.080]   Three years ago when we bought our house, we went to a guy, you have to go to the guy,
[01:42:41.080 --> 01:42:42.080]   right?
[01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:43.080]   The guy.
[01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:47.720]   And he has a stack of a sheaf of very like rice paper on a giant clipboard and he's licking
[01:42:47.720 --> 01:42:50.080]   his finger and thumbing through.
[01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:52.720]   Let me see what rates I can find for you.
[01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:54.120]   That's crazy.
[01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:56.720]   We got nowadays this thing called computers.
[01:42:56.720 --> 01:42:58.520]   Rocket Mortgage does it all online.
[01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:02.720]   You're getting it from a great lender that you're, it's simple.
[01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:03.720]   It's transparent.
[01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:04.720]   This is important.
[01:43:04.720 --> 01:43:05.920]   You understand all the details.
[01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:07.040]   You go through it.
[01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:10.360]   It's very convenient because they've got partnerships with all the financial institutions.
[01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:12.760]   So you don't have to go through boxes of paperwork.
[01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:16.600]   You can submit your pay stubs and your bank statements with a touch of a button, a touch
[01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:17.600]   of a finger.
[01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:22.200]   You could do it on your phone and whether you're looking to buy your first home or your tenth,
[01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:24.800]   they're going to make it easy for you.

[01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:34.200]   You could choose the rate.

[01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:45.520]   You could actually do it at an open house and get a home loan approval at an open house
[01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:46.680]   on your phone.
[01:43:46.680 --> 01:43:51.000]   Apply simply, understand fully mortgage confidently.

[01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:03.440]   states and MLS consumer access.org number 30, 30.
[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:07.880]   That's time for the loan business to get into the 21st century.
[01:44:07.880 --> 01:44:13.640]   Lift the burden of getting a home loan or a refi if you're doing that at Rocket Mortgage.
[01:44:13.640 --> 01:44:17.280]   By clicking loans, we think we can loan and rocket mortgage for their support of the show.
[01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:23.760]   I thank Owen J. J. Stone, O. Doctor, we call him for his ego eye on the bottom line.
[01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:24.760]   You know what?
[01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:28.040]   This year I may make more than $70,000 thanks to you.
[01:44:28.040 --> 01:44:30.400]   I can afford this bomb filled jacket.
[01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:31.560]   You can go to Whole Foods.
[01:44:31.560 --> 01:44:34.000]   I can go to Old Shop Poul Foods.
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:38.200]   As long as I can bring a briefcase and raid the cabinets next time I come out to visit.
[01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:40.800]   I'm trying to get, I can give it away my inheritance.
[01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:43.400]   So now I want to keep all old drones.
[01:44:43.400 --> 01:44:45.160]   Oh, you know what?
[01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:46.400]   You want those old drones.
[01:44:46.400 --> 01:44:48.800]   I will package them up and send them out to you.
[01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:49.800]   You do that.
[01:44:49.800 --> 01:44:50.800]   You turn them on.
[01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:51.800]   They go like this.
[01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:52.800]   You can fix it.
[01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:53.800]   You can fix it.
[01:44:53.800 --> 01:45:01.200]   By the way, you can picture that drone morgue that you've got.
[01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:02.480]   I'd love to see a photo of it.
[01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:03.480]   It's funny.
[01:45:03.480 --> 01:45:07.920]   It's just like this pile, except for that one that got away.
[01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:14.440]   Amazon also this week launched Prime Wardrobe, by the way, very similar to Trunk Club or
[01:45:14.440 --> 01:45:16.880]   Bombfell.
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:20.680]   And what they do, you get more savings the more you keep.
[01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:22.720]   So they had sent this again.
[01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:23.720]   Brand?
[01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:27.040]   No, the brand is Amazon.
[01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:29.360]   And that's all you need to know, right?
[01:45:29.360 --> 01:45:32.520]   They are the dinosaur that continues to eat.
[01:45:32.520 --> 01:45:36.480]   Other ones sit there and they get upset because, oh, I used to eat meat.
[01:45:36.480 --> 01:45:38.280]   Well, Amazon's like, we'll eat everything.
[01:45:38.280 --> 01:45:42.320]   Vegetables, nuts, oxygen, whatever we have to do to survive, they do it and they're doing
[01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:44.920]   it so well, it's scary.
[01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:50.640]   So Amazon now also getting out in front on AI, getting out front on the cloud.
[01:45:50.640 --> 01:45:53.400]   What about the rumor that they were going to buy Slack?
[01:45:53.400 --> 01:45:56.080]   Amazon was going to bid nine billion for Slack, according to Blo.
[01:45:56.080 --> 01:45:58.080]   The day before they buy Whole Foods.
[01:45:58.080 --> 01:45:59.080]   Yeah.
[01:45:59.080 --> 01:46:00.080]   They might still.
[01:46:00.080 --> 01:46:01.080]   Why would you?
[01:46:01.080 --> 01:46:02.080]   Yeah.
[01:46:02.080 --> 01:46:08.760]   My guess is Amazon was meeting with Slack because they want to buy some prototyp activity
[01:46:08.760 --> 01:46:10.520]   to add to their enterprise offering.
[01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:12.280]   And why wouldn't you meet with Slack?
[01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:15.600]   All the reports were that they were having initial meetings to discuss things but that
[01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:17.360]   they weren't talking deals yet.
[01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:18.360]   Yeah.
[01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:20.480]   I mean, these companies meet all the time.
[01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:21.720]   Like you take that deal, right?
[01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:23.960]   You take that meeting all the time.
[01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:26.720]   So yeah, I didn't necessarily put a lot of stock into it.
[01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:28.840]   But like Tom said, they still could.
[01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:34.640]   I think that they want to obviously cloud software is where they are making most of their money.
[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:44.760]   But on AWS is their cash register and long term, they are probably going to make more
[01:46:44.760 --> 01:46:46.960]   money running things.
[01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:49.120]   That's why I think that's a delivery business.
[01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:53.280]   Whereas I still think that because they're not making a lot of money on retail, I still
[01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:57.560]   think of that as a delivery business, which is why I have to think that at some point
[01:46:57.560 --> 01:47:03.560]   they get big enough and they buy FedEx or UPS or they just start their own because they're
[01:47:03.560 --> 01:47:05.040]   really in the delivery business.
[01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:07.440]   They deliver information and they deliver goods.
[01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:11.440]   Well you may remember, there was a great book about Amazon called Dog Fight.
[01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:14.480]   I don't know if you read a really good book.
[01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:21.640]   And one of the things they talk about it is how Amazon hard-balled FedEx when FedEx said
[01:47:21.640 --> 01:47:24.920]   we're going to, you guys are getting way too good a deal, way below market.
[01:47:24.920 --> 01:47:26.600]   We're going to raise your rates.
[01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:29.480]   And Amazon said, no problem.
[01:47:29.480 --> 01:47:30.480]   We can handle that.
[01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:33.600]   We can move it all our business to UPS and it was over.
[01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:36.560]   Or it might have been the other direction, but it was just over.
[01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:39.560]   Amazon does so much that they don't need these guys.
[01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:43.240]   Now Amazon, and Amazon plays that game where they don't care who you are.
[01:47:43.240 --> 01:47:47.320]   They're like, look, we're giving 20% to the post office.
[01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:51.040]   We're giving 50% to UPS and then the rest were shipping off on our own.
[01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:52.040]   I love it.
[01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:56.600]   The post office, the mailman comes to me on Sunday, not for mail, but for Amazon.
[01:47:56.600 --> 01:47:57.600]   Yeah.
[01:47:57.600 --> 01:47:59.400]   What day is it today?
[01:47:59.400 --> 01:48:04.440]   Sunday, this is when the, because I guess that a lot of these trucks are contracted out.
[01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:06.240]   I don't know what, what the deal is.
[01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:07.760]   The number, the number day is the 25th.
[01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:11.880]   Today is the day that if you were listening to this podcast and you are listening and
[01:48:11.880 --> 01:48:15.440]   heeding the words of Jason, you would go out and buy UPS stock.
[01:48:15.440 --> 01:48:17.920]   That's only $110 a share currently.
[01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:20.160]   And just sitting, wait, just go drop three Gs.
[01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:22.720]   When you short it, why don't you short it?
[01:48:22.720 --> 01:48:23.720]   Yeah.
[01:48:23.720 --> 01:48:25.520]   You think they'll buy UPS?
[01:48:25.520 --> 01:48:26.520]   Yeah.
[01:48:26.520 --> 01:48:28.080]   It's $100 a share.
[01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:29.080]   I'm just saying.
[01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:30.080]   You can afford $100 a share.
[01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:32.920]   I should have a second for Amazon's podcast right now.
[01:48:32.920 --> 01:48:37.040]   I'm just telling the people, if you got a little bit of a podcast, I think, I think
[01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:38.040]   there's a risk.
[01:48:38.040 --> 01:48:42.880]   I think you're taking a chance that maybe they'll buy UPS, but maybe they won't.
[01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:45.440]   Maybe they'll just set up their own, which is what they're doing.
[01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:46.440]   Let's put this way.
[01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:48.440]   UPS ain't going out of business no time soon.
[01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:54.760]   It'd be smart to buy the logistics operation of either UPS or FedEx.
[01:48:54.760 --> 01:48:55.760]   Yeah.
[01:48:55.760 --> 01:48:56.760]   Yeah.
[01:48:56.760 --> 01:48:58.440]   UPS is amazing logistics company.
[01:48:58.440 --> 01:49:00.800]   They are more and more a technology company, right?
[01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:01.800]   And Amazon.
[01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:05.040]   So at some point they become a threat to Amazon.
[01:49:05.040 --> 01:49:10.200]   And so taking them off the market, taking a competitor off the market is always, you
[01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:14.400]   know, maybe can we agree that this is just the beginning of a buying spree that Jeff Bezos
[01:49:14.400 --> 01:49:21.080]   is about to go all in, like push all his chips in and say, all right, the time is right.
[01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:23.240]   You read you read the mission statement, brother.
[01:49:23.240 --> 01:49:24.240]   Yeah.
[01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:25.240]   You read the mission statement.
[01:49:25.240 --> 01:49:26.240]   Yeah.
[01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:27.240]   Yeah.
[01:49:27.240 --> 01:49:28.240]   I'm going to give me a couple of extra shares.
[01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:31.240]   I already got some, but I'm going to give me a couple of extra just so.
[01:49:31.240 --> 01:49:32.240]   Yeah.
[01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:33.840]   No, no, Jim Kramer thinks you're right.
[01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:36.440]   You sure that business is strong, right?
[01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:38.440]   Whether, yeah, however it is.
[01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:42.400]   And UPS is based their headquarters or one of their big headquarters is in Louisville.
[01:49:42.400 --> 01:49:43.920]   They live in Louisville.
[01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:44.920]   You know why?
[01:49:44.920 --> 01:49:46.720]   Because your airport is perfect.
[01:49:46.720 --> 01:49:47.720]   Yeah.
[01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:49.080]   It's like a hub, right?
[01:49:49.080 --> 01:49:50.160]   It is a hub.
[01:49:50.160 --> 01:49:54.680]   And that's like half of the traffic at the airport is UPS.
[01:49:54.680 --> 01:50:00.280]   And they, it's also, I think, made it's the fourth largest ship in the airport in the
[01:50:00.280 --> 01:50:02.040]   world or in the US.
[01:50:02.040 --> 01:50:03.040]   And where is FedEx?
[01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:04.040]   Is it Knoxville?
[01:50:04.040 --> 01:50:05.040]   FedEx also is in Memphis.
[01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:06.040]   It's in Memphis.
[01:50:06.040 --> 01:50:07.040]   That's right.
[01:50:07.040 --> 01:50:08.040]   Memphis.
[01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:09.040]   Yeah.
[01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:10.040]   Yep.
[01:50:10.040 --> 01:50:11.040]   So there must be something about that particular area.
[01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:16.040]   I guess because a lot of businesses on the Eastern Seaboard, but that's the hub you want.
[01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:21.280]   And everything, if you ship FedEx, everything where I could buy, I could ship something
[01:50:21.280 --> 01:50:24.520]   from here to San Francisco, it's stop off in Memphis on the way.
[01:50:24.520 --> 01:50:25.520]   Yeah.
[01:50:25.520 --> 01:50:26.520]   It's wild.
[01:50:26.520 --> 01:50:27.800]   Those are logistics businesses.
[01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:32.520]   And I guess I have to think though that Amazon also knows logistics pretty well.
[01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:33.520]   Yeah.
[01:50:33.520 --> 01:50:38.400]   Amazon buys UPS if they see a piece of technology there that is easier for them to acquire.
[01:50:38.400 --> 01:50:39.400]   That would be my guess.
[01:50:39.400 --> 01:50:40.400]   Buy or build.
[01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:41.400]   That's always a decision.
[01:50:41.400 --> 01:50:42.400]   All right.
[01:50:42.400 --> 01:50:43.400]   We haven't talked about Travis Kalanek yet.
[01:50:43.400 --> 01:50:46.400]   I got my shot glass ready to pour a little off.
[01:50:46.400 --> 01:50:48.200]   I'm really worried Travis.
[01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:49.200]   Uber.
[01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:50.200]   Yeah.
[01:50:50.200 --> 01:50:53.480]   It seemed for a while there every week there was a new Uber story.
[01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:56.040]   It's an unbelievable story.
[01:50:56.040 --> 01:50:57.480]   Grown after Grown.
[01:50:57.480 --> 01:50:58.480]   Grown after Grown.
[01:50:58.480 --> 01:51:01.880]   Of course, the story this week, Travis Kalanek.
[01:51:01.880 --> 01:51:08.600]   Great story in the New York Times about how the board decided to fire after hours of
[01:51:08.600 --> 01:51:09.760]   drama.
[01:51:09.760 --> 01:51:12.760]   We are the board resistances.
[01:51:12.760 --> 01:51:17.520]   Mr. Kalanek's exit came under pressure after hours of drama involving Uber's investors
[01:51:17.520 --> 01:51:21.400]   according to two people with colleges as a situation.
[01:51:21.400 --> 01:51:27.840]   They're phone calls and hotel calls and Bill Girly who by the way, who's the venture partner
[01:51:27.840 --> 01:51:31.960]   at the benchmark capital, one of the big investors has left Uber's board to put another
[01:51:31.960 --> 01:51:33.040]   partner on the board.
[01:51:33.040 --> 01:51:35.120]   Maybe he's somehow tarnished.
[01:51:35.120 --> 01:51:38.680]   But Kalanek was in Chicago.
[01:51:38.680 --> 01:51:44.920]   A letter hand delivered to him says, Mr. Kalanek, time to say good night.
[01:51:44.920 --> 01:51:46.560]   Now he's still going to be chairman of the board.
[01:51:46.560 --> 01:51:51.320]   He ain't going really anywhere, but he's not going to have day to day operational management.
[01:51:51.320 --> 01:51:57.000]   Interestingly, a thousand Uber employees signed a petition saying, we must have him back.
[01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:00.280]   He's the only guy who can run Uber.
[01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:05.400]   But the investors clearly felt that he was more of a liability than an asset to the company.
[01:52:05.400 --> 01:52:07.600]   Your thoughts.
[01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:10.200]   Tom, you start.
[01:52:10.200 --> 01:52:11.200]   Go ahead.
[01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:12.200]   Tom, go ahead.
[01:52:12.200 --> 01:52:15.000]   You got the shot glass in hand.
[01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:22.840]   I think this is a very difficult situation for Uber to be and they have virtually no sea
[01:52:22.840 --> 01:52:23.840]   level executives.
[01:52:23.840 --> 01:52:26.040]   They have a committee of 14 people running the company.
[01:52:26.040 --> 01:52:31.440]   Travis Kalanek was doing the things that he needed to do at this point.
[01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:35.240]   Now you can rightly say too little too late as far as forgiving him personally.
[01:52:35.240 --> 01:52:40.160]   But he was finally saying, yes, we're going to get rid of people.
[01:52:40.160 --> 01:52:41.560]   We're going to change the company culture.
[01:52:41.560 --> 01:52:45.200]   I mean, Ariana Huffington was right there next to him cheering him on saying, here's
[01:52:45.200 --> 01:52:48.240]   all the things you have to do.
[01:52:48.240 --> 01:52:52.000]   And yet that faction of the board said, you know what, we'd just rather have you out of
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.480]   the way so we can pick an adult.
[01:52:54.480 --> 01:52:58.040]   And maybe not that they didn't think the world of Travis or his abilities, but just
[01:52:58.040 --> 01:53:00.200]   it was too much of a liability.
[01:53:00.200 --> 01:53:05.840]   And I think what is odd to me is that they didn't have a candidate already lined up after
[01:53:05.840 --> 01:53:06.840]   all of this.
[01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:07.840]   That is interesting, right?
[01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:09.080]   We don't know who's taking his place.
[01:53:09.080 --> 01:53:10.080]   Yeah.
[01:53:10.080 --> 01:53:12.320]   And that will be the telling tale here, right?
[01:53:12.320 --> 01:53:15.560]   If they were to get a Cheryl Sandberg, I don't think they'll get Cheryl Sandberg to leave
[01:53:15.560 --> 01:53:16.560]   Facebook.
[01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:20.080]   But if they were to get somebody like that, that makes sense to me.
[01:53:20.080 --> 01:53:25.040]   If they get someone unknown or someone who doesn't have a proven track record, then that
[01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:26.800]   makes not a lot of sense at all.
[01:53:26.800 --> 01:53:27.800]   Yeah.
[01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:28.800]   And in fact, you're right.
[01:53:28.800 --> 01:53:33.760]   It would have made sense is to go out and talk to a Cheryl Sandberg or to, I'm sorry,
[01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:35.920]   let me heat auto play video.
[01:53:35.920 --> 01:53:36.920]   Thank you.
[01:53:36.920 --> 01:53:40.160]   Let me go out and talk to Susan Wojcicki.
[01:53:40.160 --> 01:53:43.120]   She's been floated as an agency of YouTube.
[01:53:43.120 --> 01:53:47.560]   Maybe a guy, maybe some like Alan Malali, another person who's been named as the former
[01:53:47.560 --> 01:53:54.160]   CEO Ford who is currently just kind of hanging out, not doing anything.
[01:53:54.160 --> 01:53:55.160]   And a smart guy.
[01:53:55.160 --> 01:53:58.600]   And if you think that self-driving vehicles are important to Uber's future, might be
[01:53:58.600 --> 01:54:02.840]   a good choice, wouldn't you go and talk to some of those people and say, look, we're
[01:54:02.840 --> 01:54:04.440]   going to boot Kalanet.
[01:54:04.440 --> 01:54:05.440]   Yeah.
[01:54:05.440 --> 01:54:09.600]   Because the reason you get rid of Kalanet as far as like just brass text, if you're the
[01:54:09.600 --> 01:54:11.480]   board, I think you get rid of him.
[01:54:11.480 --> 01:54:15.520]   Obviously, not to please the employees because you've got a bit of an employee revolt going
[01:54:15.520 --> 01:54:18.480]   on, but because you want to polish it up for the IPO.
[01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:20.720]   You don't want to have this in the way for the.
[01:54:20.720 --> 01:54:21.720]   And regulators.
[01:54:21.720 --> 01:54:22.720]   Yep.
[01:54:22.720 --> 01:54:25.080]   And, you know, I mean, you've got to consider government issues.
[01:54:25.080 --> 01:54:29.680]   I mean, Uber has been fighting the government since day one, local governments.
[01:54:29.680 --> 01:54:34.480]   They obviously considered him a toxic asset at this point.
[01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:37.520]   And so he had done a lot.
[01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:40.240]   His obviously super aggressive.
[01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:47.760]   He is the one that made Uber Uber and for better and worse.
[01:54:47.760 --> 01:54:52.320]   And they had a lot of stuff they need to clean up and clean their house.
[01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:55.040]   And they just decided that he wasn't the one to clean it up.
[01:54:55.040 --> 01:54:57.440]   Like he's the one who created the mess.
[01:54:57.440 --> 01:55:02.440]   And him clean it up, you know, probably doesn't work is essentially the board decided.
[01:55:02.440 --> 01:55:06.120]   When he owns the majority of voting shares, the only way you convince him of this is to
[01:55:06.120 --> 01:55:11.320]   say we need to bring in a caretaker CEO who's going to guide us through the IPO and make
[01:55:11.320 --> 01:55:13.400]   that really profitable for you, Travis.
[01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:16.360]   And ideally, ideally, ideally a woman, right?
[01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:20.960]   Because if you bring in a woman, then you can maybe get rid of that shed that bro image.
[01:55:20.960 --> 01:55:25.440]   And then maybe even say Travis will bring you back after the IPO a year or two later.
[01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:30.440]   I see NBC looking through some possible candidates.
[01:55:30.440 --> 01:55:34.240]   Ursula Burns, former CEO at Xerox.
[01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:37.000]   She retired in December.
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:43.320]   Megan Smith, of course, who was at Google and is currently the well, I'm not sure what
[01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:44.320]   she's doing now.
[01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:46.720]   She was CTO, US CTO in her Barack Obama.
[01:55:46.720 --> 01:55:50.440]   I guess she's gone from the yeah, her last job ended in January.
[01:55:50.440 --> 01:55:52.000]   Don't know what happened January 20th.
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:53.000]   Something happened.
[01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:54.640]   And she's out of work.
[01:55:54.640 --> 01:56:04.120]   By the way, formerly partner of Keras Swisher, John Rubenstein, ex CEO at Bridgewater, world's
[01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:05.120]   largest hedge fund.
[01:56:05.120 --> 01:56:06.120]   I'm not sure.
[01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:09.120]   I think I don't Adam Bain, former CEO.
[01:56:09.120 --> 01:56:10.680]   Oh, it's a winner.
[01:56:10.680 --> 01:56:14.440]   Remember, Ruby was it at all and they're good IPO related.
[01:56:14.440 --> 01:56:15.680]   Howard Schultz.
[01:56:15.680 --> 01:56:17.680]   Starbucks CEO.
[01:56:17.680 --> 01:56:20.680]   Allen, Molly, that's a joke.
[01:56:20.680 --> 01:56:24.640]   Nobody's going to hire Scott Forstall or Tony Fidell.
[01:56:24.640 --> 01:56:28.120]   I mean, they both have kind of contentious reputations from Apple.
[01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:29.960]   I'll hire Marissa buyer before that.
[01:56:29.960 --> 01:56:31.720]   Marissa Myers available.
[01:56:31.720 --> 01:56:32.720]   Yeah.
[01:56:32.720 --> 01:56:34.960]   Allen Malali would be great.
[01:56:34.960 --> 01:56:36.720]   I like Allen Malali.
[01:56:36.720 --> 01:56:37.720]   I really.
[01:56:37.720 --> 01:56:38.720]   He's terrific.
[01:56:38.720 --> 01:56:39.720]   I don't think they'll get him out of retirement.
[01:56:39.720 --> 01:56:40.720]   I'd be shocked.
[01:56:40.720 --> 01:56:42.720]   But if they did, what a coup.
[01:56:42.720 --> 01:56:46.200]   You know, who else was afforded is currently looking for work.
[01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:47.200]   Mark Fields.
[01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:48.200]   Yeah.
[01:56:48.200 --> 01:56:49.200]   I don't know.
[01:56:49.200 --> 01:56:50.200]   Can I have a happen here?
[01:56:50.200 --> 01:56:51.200]   Yeah.
[01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:52.760]   Dreaming about CEOs.
[01:56:52.760 --> 01:56:54.320]   One, Goodriddons.
[01:56:54.320 --> 01:56:59.560]   Two, whoopty two, a thousand bros spoke up on his behalf.
[01:56:59.560 --> 01:57:02.400]   I'm sure there's close to a million Uber drivers.
[01:57:02.400 --> 01:57:05.360]   So that's like point one zero zero minus negative.
[01:57:05.360 --> 01:57:06.360]   Ooh percent.
[01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:11.080]   I'm just like, this dude can't be trusted to write the shit because he's just running
[01:57:11.080 --> 01:57:13.880]   around throwing gasoline on everything and his hands were on fire.
[01:57:13.880 --> 01:57:14.880]   Like the dude needed to be.
[01:57:14.880 --> 01:57:16.240]   It never got better.
[01:57:16.240 --> 01:57:22.720]   And by the way, credit to Susan Fowler who wrote the blog post that brought Kalanik down,
[01:57:22.720 --> 01:57:27.040]   complaining about her year as an engineer at Uber where she was not only sexually harassed
[01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:32.000]   but her complaints to supervisors got ignored, got poo-pooed.
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:33.640]   They say, oh yeah, that guy.
[01:57:33.640 --> 01:57:34.840]   This is, he's a nice guy.
[01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:37.680]   It's the first time this has ever happened and she'd find out later that there was a
[01:57:37.680 --> 01:57:39.120]   trap in 20 times before.
[01:57:39.120 --> 01:57:40.120]   It was just a mess.
[01:57:40.120 --> 01:57:44.800]   Susan Fowler's blog post, I think you can directly attribute it to the fall of Travis
[01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:45.800]   Kalanik.
[01:57:45.800 --> 01:57:50.400]   This is just a bait and switch to get you to not look at the ship still being a flame
[01:57:50.400 --> 01:57:54.520]   because the culture at the top core is still the same.
[01:57:54.520 --> 01:57:57.880]   You get rid of him, but the people who allowed it and accepted it are still there.
[01:57:57.880 --> 01:58:02.240]   So I mean, you, they've got a lot of restructuring to do and they've got a lot of things going
[01:58:02.240 --> 01:58:03.240]   to be.
[01:58:03.240 --> 01:58:04.240]   Besides.
[01:58:04.240 --> 01:58:09.800]   They got more, they were by the way, more scandals to come.
[01:58:09.800 --> 01:58:15.760]   Apparently Kalanik knew that Leven Dasky had stolen intellectual property from Google.
[01:58:15.760 --> 01:58:21.480]   No, Leven Dasky said I have a couple of disworth of Google stuff and Uber said, great, keep
[01:58:21.480 --> 01:58:22.480]   it to yourself.
[01:58:22.480 --> 01:58:23.640]   We don't want to know anything to do with it.
[01:58:23.640 --> 01:58:25.440]   We don't know what was on the distance.
[01:58:25.440 --> 01:58:29.400]   Yeah, what we don't know is if they said keep it to yourself, we don't want to know or keep
[01:58:29.400 --> 01:58:30.560]   it to yourself.
[01:58:30.560 --> 01:58:31.560]   We don't want to know.
[01:58:31.560 --> 01:58:32.560]   Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.
[01:58:32.560 --> 01:58:35.560]   Well, what we do know is Uber is now allowing tipping.
[01:58:35.560 --> 01:58:39.360]   Well, they've always allowed tipping.
[01:58:39.360 --> 01:58:41.440]   This is by the way, is always pissed me off.
[01:58:41.440 --> 01:58:46.120]   I feel guilty because I for years took Ubers because I somehow got the impression that
[01:58:46.120 --> 01:58:49.640]   they wouldn't let their drivers tell you they were the tips were allowed.
[01:58:49.640 --> 01:58:50.640]   Yeah.
[01:58:50.640 --> 01:58:52.600]   And then I found out because somebody sued, right?
[01:58:52.600 --> 01:58:54.320]   Some driver sued and I found out.
[01:58:54.320 --> 01:58:58.360]   Oh, so now I tip, but now finally they're putting it in the app.
[01:58:58.360 --> 01:58:59.360]   Yeah.
[01:58:59.360 --> 01:59:00.360]   Yeah.
[01:59:00.360 --> 01:59:01.360]   In some regions.
[01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:06.840]   So Connie Wright does a column at dailytech news show.com called your private driver from
[01:59:06.840 --> 01:59:08.640]   the perspective of an actual driver.
[01:59:08.640 --> 01:59:09.640]   Oh, interesting.
[01:59:09.640 --> 01:59:12.680]   And he's very happy about Uber putting this in.
[01:59:12.680 --> 01:59:16.000]   He's like, do tip your drivers when it's appropriate when you get good service?
[01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:17.000]   I always tip them.
[01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:20.680]   He said, we don't see the amount until after we've rated you.
[01:59:20.680 --> 01:59:25.320]   So don't worry about if you don't tip, you're going to get a bad rider rating.
[01:59:25.320 --> 01:59:27.960]   So this is a big deal for the drivers.
[01:59:27.960 --> 01:59:29.920]   I think Uber and Lyft a lot.
[01:59:29.920 --> 01:59:32.280]   I talk to a lot of the drivers too.
[01:59:32.280 --> 01:59:38.320]   And I think that, you know, by and large and because of the smell test with Uber lately,
[01:59:38.320 --> 01:59:42.440]   you know, I always take Lyft when I prefer to.
[01:59:42.440 --> 01:59:50.840]   That said, we have to keep the big perspective in mind in that in Uber has over 50% market
[01:59:50.840 --> 01:59:52.840]   share in this market.
[01:59:52.840 --> 01:59:55.200]   In most places, Uber is a verb.
[01:59:55.200 --> 01:59:56.200]   Right.
[01:59:56.200 --> 02:00:00.480]   Most places don't hear about any of these stories or hear very little about them.
[02:00:00.480 --> 02:00:05.040]   And five years from now, it's going to be one of those things where if you ask somebody
[02:00:05.040 --> 02:00:08.840]   on the streets, they're still taking Uber and they're going, yeah.
[02:00:08.840 --> 02:00:12.200]   And you ask them, like, what did you think about the whole CEO thing and their new CEO
[02:00:12.200 --> 02:00:13.200]   and all that?
[02:00:13.200 --> 02:00:15.960]   Like, oh, yeah, I didn't like the founder a few years ago.
[02:00:15.960 --> 02:00:19.880]   They replaced him with somebody else and they're not going to know, right?
[02:00:19.880 --> 02:00:23.880]   All they're going to know is they got a much better way of taking it, you know, getting
[02:00:23.880 --> 02:00:25.080]   a ride than they used to.
[02:00:25.080 --> 02:00:29.320]   Hey, Jason, Jason, in five years, you're going to be in a car with no driver and you
[02:00:29.320 --> 02:00:31.160]   won't be able to ask me questions.
[02:00:31.160 --> 02:00:35.000]   Well, clearly that's the only thing that would actually save Uber.
[02:00:35.000 --> 02:00:36.320]   Uber, Lyft and all these guys as a business.
[02:00:36.320 --> 02:00:40.120]   Because what I didn't realize, how much of that cost of an Uber ride is subsidized
[02:00:40.120 --> 02:00:41.120]   by the company.
[02:00:41.120 --> 02:00:45.560]   I mean, I knew that they were losing money hand over fist despite massive revenues.
[02:00:45.560 --> 02:00:50.840]   It turns out 41% of the, you only, when you take an Uber, you pay for 41% of the cost.
[02:00:50.840 --> 02:00:52.800]   The company pays 59% of the cost.
[02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:54.520]   That's why they lose money like crazy.
[02:00:54.520 --> 02:00:58.360]   Uber rides, and I presume this is true of all of these rides sharing services, are highly
[02:00:58.360 --> 02:00:59.360]   subsidized.
[02:00:59.360 --> 02:01:03.520]   So they can't survive with a driver economy.
[02:01:03.520 --> 02:01:06.640]   They can only survive in an autonomous economy.
[02:01:06.640 --> 02:01:10.240]   The problem is there's a lot better because Lyft isn't spending as much money as Uber
[02:01:10.240 --> 02:01:11.480]   on a lot of this stuff.
[02:01:11.480 --> 02:01:12.480]   Yeah.
[02:01:12.480 --> 02:01:13.480]   Yeah.
[02:01:13.480 --> 02:01:17.040]   The company chose through to try and get to a lower, lower price for fares.
[02:01:17.040 --> 02:01:19.440]   And it's not really helping the drivers that much either.
[02:01:19.440 --> 02:01:20.760]   It's like a payday loan.
[02:01:20.760 --> 02:01:23.360]   Every time I talk to an Uber driver, it's a mixed bag.
[02:01:23.360 --> 02:01:24.360]   On the one hand, they like it.
[02:01:24.360 --> 02:01:26.800]   They can make money on their own time and all that stuff.
[02:01:26.800 --> 02:01:30.640]   Almost all of them drive from multiple companies anyway.
[02:01:30.640 --> 02:01:33.000]   But nobody loves Uber, I don't think.
[02:01:33.000 --> 02:01:34.000]   Yeah.
[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:35.920]   Nobody works for them loves them except the bros.
[02:01:35.920 --> 02:01:39.000]   By the way, this is not unique to Uber.
[02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:45.920]   This week we also learned that a venture capitalist, Justin called back at Bain Capital
[02:01:45.920 --> 02:01:52.600]   and Lightspeed Ventures, who then started his own from a binary capital, had been harassing
[02:01:52.600 --> 02:01:58.120]   female entrepreneurs who'd come to him for funding her advice.
[02:01:58.120 --> 02:02:00.040]   Six women have come forward now.
[02:02:00.040 --> 02:02:02.040]   He's stepped back.
[02:02:02.040 --> 02:02:05.920]   I don't know the name and I guess he's not that well known outside of VC.
[02:02:05.920 --> 02:02:08.920]   But his firm had raised $300 million.
[02:02:08.920 --> 02:02:15.880]   They're holding off on their next round because, well, he's taking more time to be with his
[02:02:15.880 --> 02:02:17.760]   family.
[02:02:17.760 --> 02:02:20.960]   And he says he's going to undergo treatment.
[02:02:20.960 --> 02:02:23.440]   But we keep hearing these stories, right?
[02:02:23.440 --> 02:02:25.200]   There is something going on in Silicon Valley.
[02:02:25.200 --> 02:02:27.440]   There is some sort of roculture.
[02:02:27.440 --> 02:02:32.080]   There's something that goes on with powerful rich people.
[02:02:32.080 --> 02:02:33.680]   Yeah, because it's look at Fox, right?
[02:02:33.680 --> 02:02:34.680]   I mean, it is.
[02:02:34.680 --> 02:02:35.680]   You're right.
[02:02:35.680 --> 02:02:36.680]   It's not.
[02:02:36.680 --> 02:02:37.680]   Look at me.
[02:02:37.680 --> 02:02:38.680]   I mean, no, no, look at me.
[02:02:38.680 --> 02:02:42.320]   Once you're at the top echelon, it's this tale of time.
[02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:43.320]   I'm the boss.
[02:02:43.320 --> 02:02:44.320]   You're the secretary.
[02:02:44.320 --> 02:02:46.480]   Do you want to get a position and not be a secretary?
[02:02:46.480 --> 02:02:49.480]   Well, I'm going to see what you'll do to get that position.
[02:02:49.480 --> 02:02:51.400]   You know, and these people sit out there and so come down.
[02:02:51.400 --> 02:02:52.400]   The problem is men.
[02:02:52.400 --> 02:02:54.400]   So burn and it's free money.
[02:02:54.400 --> 02:02:55.400]   Yeah.
[02:02:55.400 --> 02:02:57.840]   Blowin' it, act a crazy loser in their mouth.
[02:02:57.840 --> 02:02:59.680]   And all these old dudes thinking they're special.
[02:02:59.680 --> 02:03:00.680]   You're not special.
[02:03:00.680 --> 02:03:02.840]   You're out here messing with these women and mess with people.
[02:03:02.840 --> 02:03:03.840]   Okay.
[02:03:03.840 --> 02:03:04.840]   Sipe yourself through.
[02:03:04.840 --> 02:03:06.960]   And this guy is going to get off with an apology.
[02:03:06.960 --> 02:03:07.960]   Oh, I'm really sorry.
[02:03:07.960 --> 02:03:08.960]   I'm going to step away.
[02:03:08.960 --> 02:03:09.960]   He's going to go to therapy.
[02:03:09.960 --> 02:03:10.960]   Therapy.
[02:03:10.960 --> 02:03:11.960]   Yeah, he's going to therapy.
[02:03:11.960 --> 02:03:12.960]   Yeah.
[02:03:12.960 --> 02:03:13.960]   Yeah.
[02:03:13.960 --> 02:03:14.960]   Okay.
[02:03:14.960 --> 02:03:15.960]   Anger.
[02:03:15.960 --> 02:03:16.960]   Supreme Court.
[02:03:16.960 --> 02:03:18.120]   Let's do a couple of, we're going to take a break.
[02:03:18.120 --> 02:03:20.560]   Let's do a couple of Supreme Court stories and then wrap it up because I know Tom, you've
[02:03:20.560 --> 02:03:22.240]   got to get out of here in a few minutes.
[02:03:22.240 --> 02:03:23.240]   Yeah.
[02:03:23.240 --> 02:03:24.240]   Thanks, man.
[02:03:24.240 --> 02:03:25.240]   Tom Merritt, dailytechnewsshow.com.
[02:03:25.240 --> 02:03:26.240]   At Ace Detective.
[02:03:26.240 --> 02:03:30.960]   You got a hot date, you're going out to a show theater taking a lane to a fine restaurant.
[02:03:30.960 --> 02:03:32.680]   No, I'm doing another pocket.
[02:03:32.680 --> 02:03:33.680]   Oh, okay.
[02:03:33.680 --> 02:03:35.160]   By the way, it's Eileen.
[02:03:35.160 --> 02:03:36.160]   No, no.
[02:03:36.160 --> 02:03:37.560]   I just call her a lane because it drives her crazy.
[02:03:37.560 --> 02:03:38.560]   It's a tradition.
[02:03:38.560 --> 02:03:39.560]   It's a tradition.
[02:03:39.560 --> 02:03:40.560]   I call her a lane from day one.
[02:03:40.560 --> 02:03:41.560]   I don't know why.
[02:03:41.560 --> 02:03:42.560]   You did.
[02:03:42.560 --> 02:03:43.560]   I don't either.
[02:03:43.560 --> 02:03:44.560]   I'm leaving.
[02:03:44.560 --> 02:03:45.560]   I'm leaving.
[02:03:45.560 --> 02:03:46.560]   Too much.
[02:03:46.560 --> 02:03:47.560]   That's it.
[02:03:47.560 --> 02:03:50.960]   Also, Jason Heiner from, I've never called his wife by any other name.
[02:03:50.960 --> 02:03:52.600]   Jason Heiner from Tech Republic.
[02:03:52.600 --> 02:03:53.600]   Definitely.
[02:03:53.600 --> 02:03:54.600]   Great to have you.
[02:03:54.600 --> 02:03:55.600]   I'm here.
[02:03:55.600 --> 02:03:56.600]   Oh, my camera must have froze.
[02:03:56.600 --> 02:03:57.600]   Hang on.
[02:03:57.600 --> 02:03:58.600]   Okay.
[02:03:58.600 --> 02:03:59.600]   The disappearing Jason Heiner.
[02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:00.600]   He's invisible.
[02:04:00.600 --> 02:04:02.600]   He's wearing that cloak, the invisible Heiner.
[02:04:02.600 --> 02:04:04.600]   I take it off the invisibility cloak.
[02:04:04.600 --> 02:04:05.600]   Oh, Jason Stone.
[02:04:05.600 --> 02:04:06.600]   Oh, come on, Eileen.
[02:04:06.600 --> 02:04:07.600]   Oh, I swear.
[02:04:07.600 --> 02:04:12.600]   You just, at this moment, whatever someone goes, that's how you got to remember her name.
[02:04:12.600 --> 02:04:21.920]   I used to sing that to her and she practically hit me.
[02:04:21.920 --> 02:04:24.560]   Oh, she does not like it, but that's how you remember her name.
[02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:25.560]   She does not like it.
[02:04:25.560 --> 02:04:26.920]   Yeah, she doesn't like me singing it.
[02:04:26.920 --> 02:04:29.400]   She doesn't like you singing it.
[02:04:29.400 --> 02:04:31.800]   Speaking of dinner, Uncle Leo, you know what you should do?
[02:04:31.800 --> 02:04:33.360]   I, you know what I made the other day?
[02:04:33.360 --> 02:04:34.640]   Oh, it was so good.
[02:04:34.640 --> 02:04:41.240]   Canaloni, spinach canaloni, and then we, oh, we had a lovely shallot and lemon dressing
[02:04:41.240 --> 02:04:42.240]   on our cucumber set.
[02:04:42.240 --> 02:04:43.240]   It was so good.
[02:04:43.240 --> 02:04:44.240]   It was a blue apron.
[02:04:44.240 --> 02:04:45.240]   I've got waiting for me.
[02:04:45.240 --> 02:04:46.240]   That's what you're meant to let you give me a meal.
[02:04:46.240 --> 02:04:47.240]   It was a blue apron.
[02:04:47.240 --> 02:04:48.240]   You should give me a meal.
[02:04:48.240 --> 02:04:49.240]   It is.
[02:04:49.240 --> 02:04:51.560]   Well, I can get you three meals free if you want.
[02:04:51.560 --> 02:04:52.560]   I'll tell you how to do that.
[02:04:52.560 --> 02:04:53.560]   But that's even better.
[02:04:53.560 --> 02:04:55.320]   I'll tell you how to do that.
[02:04:55.320 --> 02:04:56.320]   Blue apron.
[02:04:56.320 --> 02:04:57.320]   We were talking about it earlier.
[02:04:57.320 --> 02:05:01.040]   They've really demonstrated, this is why they're the number one fresh ingredient recipe delivery
[02:05:01.040 --> 02:05:03.640]   service in the country.
[02:05:03.640 --> 02:05:09.960]   They've really demonstrated that you can deliver people amazing produce and meats and
[02:05:09.960 --> 02:05:15.560]   just fresh, no frozen, in a refrigerated box with a recipe card and make people a better
[02:05:15.560 --> 02:05:16.560]   cook.
[02:05:16.560 --> 02:05:20.000]   Every time I cook blue apron, we do about three times a week, I go, this was easy.
[02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:21.000]   I could do this again.
[02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:22.000]   This canaloni.
[02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:23.000]   I now know how to make canaloni.
[02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:24.240]   It was so good.
[02:05:24.240 --> 02:05:25.800]   I made the sauce.
[02:05:25.800 --> 02:05:29.360]   They sent me a lovely can of Marzano tomatoes from Italy.
[02:05:29.360 --> 02:05:31.920]   I had it was so good.
[02:05:31.920 --> 02:05:32.920]   Blue apron.
[02:05:32.920 --> 02:05:34.080]   Get cooking today.
[02:05:34.080 --> 02:05:35.960]   You can choose the meals you want.
[02:05:35.960 --> 02:05:38.520]   In fact, let's go to the blue apron menu.
[02:05:38.520 --> 02:05:39.760]   See what's on the menu today.
[02:05:39.760 --> 02:05:40.760]   Is that salmon?
[02:05:40.760 --> 02:05:41.760]   Yeah.
[02:05:41.760 --> 02:05:44.480]   Salmon and cilantro lime rice with peach corn salsa.
[02:05:44.480 --> 02:05:47.880]   Fresh basil fettuccine pasta with sweet corn and cubanel pepper.
[02:05:47.880 --> 02:05:50.080]   Don't know it, but I bet it looks good.
[02:05:50.080 --> 02:05:51.080]   It tastes good.
[02:05:51.080 --> 02:05:55.840]   They have vegetarian meals, summer squash and quinoa burgers with spicy roasted carrots.
[02:05:55.840 --> 02:05:57.560]   So you're going to choose three of these meals.
[02:05:57.560 --> 02:05:58.560]   This is the two person plan.
[02:05:58.560 --> 02:06:00.560]   They also have a family plan.
[02:06:00.560 --> 02:06:04.640]   By the way, the family plan has ingredients that are kid friendly and there is nothing
[02:06:04.640 --> 02:06:06.760]   like making a meal with your kid.
[02:06:06.760 --> 02:06:11.520]   Fontina cheeseburgers with rosemary, oven fries and basil aioli or asiago cheese and
[02:06:11.520 --> 02:06:15.960]   purple potato pizza with marinated peach and arugula salad.
[02:06:15.960 --> 02:06:18.560]   Damn, this looks good.
[02:06:18.560 --> 02:06:22.240]   There's nothing like making a meal with your kids to get them excited about cooking.
[02:06:22.240 --> 02:06:23.480]   They get invested in it.
[02:06:23.480 --> 02:06:25.840]   It is really, really fun.
[02:06:25.840 --> 02:06:30.760]   The two person plan, Lisa and I had leftovers almost every time we share it with Michael,
[02:06:30.760 --> 02:06:33.080]   you could probably really get three people on this.
[02:06:33.080 --> 02:06:35.800]   And it's very affordable, less than $10 per person per meal.
[02:06:35.800 --> 02:06:39.840]   In fact, it costs you less than the grocery store because no brick and mortar.
[02:06:39.840 --> 02:06:41.880]   They don't have to maintain a big outlet.
[02:06:41.880 --> 02:06:47.440]   It is the best way to get seasonal recipes, pre-porsion ingredients, everything you need
[02:06:47.440 --> 02:06:50.440]   to make delicious home cooked meals in 40 minutes or less.
[02:06:50.440 --> 02:06:51.800]   And there's no waste.
[02:06:51.800 --> 02:06:54.560]   If you need a lemon, you get a lemon.
[02:06:54.560 --> 02:06:58.320]   You don't get, you need two ribs of celery, you get two ribs of celery.
[02:06:58.320 --> 02:06:59.760]   So I love that.
[02:06:59.760 --> 02:07:01.000]   There's no weekly commitment.
[02:07:01.000 --> 02:07:04.000]   You only get deliveries when you want them.
[02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:07.840]   You choose the menu so you can customize it based on your dietary preferences.
[02:07:07.840 --> 02:07:08.840]   It is delicious.
[02:07:08.840 --> 02:07:11.920]   So all I'm asking is go to blueapron.com/twit.
[02:07:11.920 --> 02:07:16.680]   Check out this week's menu and we're going to arrange three meals free with your first
[02:07:16.680 --> 02:07:19.080]   purchase and free shipping.
[02:07:19.080 --> 02:07:21.960]   Blueapron delivers the 99% of the continental United States.
[02:07:21.960 --> 02:07:26.920]   Blueapron.com/twit.
[02:07:26.920 --> 02:07:28.400]   I can't tell you how much I love.
[02:07:28.400 --> 02:07:30.040]   I just love Blueapron.
[02:07:30.040 --> 02:07:33.400]   And every time I come home in the boxes on the door, I say, "Oh, wait.
[02:07:33.400 --> 02:07:34.640]   Lisa chooses the meals.
[02:07:34.640 --> 02:07:35.640]   I cook them."
[02:07:35.640 --> 02:07:37.200]   It's a good, she sometimes cooks them.
[02:07:37.200 --> 02:07:38.360]   But a lot of times I like to cook them.
[02:07:38.360 --> 02:07:41.520]   I say, "No, let me, let me, she'll help me with it."
[02:07:41.520 --> 02:07:42.520]   So much fun.
[02:07:42.520 --> 02:07:46.480]   You know, that's another good thing for a family or a couple to cook together.
[02:07:46.480 --> 02:07:47.480]   So much fun.
[02:07:47.480 --> 02:07:48.480]   All right.
[02:07:48.480 --> 02:07:50.800]   We got, I don't know what's going on with Jason.
[02:07:50.800 --> 02:07:52.360]   We're going to work on getting him back.
[02:07:52.360 --> 02:07:56.480]   I think we're pulling up a still now.
[02:07:56.480 --> 02:07:57.480]   Maybe this mugshot, mugshot.
[02:07:57.480 --> 02:07:59.840]   Maybe this is just time to call it quits.
[02:07:59.840 --> 02:08:01.760]   We got to let Tom go anyway.
[02:08:01.760 --> 02:08:03.680]   Tom Maris got to go to another podcast.
[02:08:03.680 --> 02:08:05.480]   Do you want to tell us what it is?
[02:08:05.480 --> 02:08:06.480]   Well, yeah.
[02:08:06.480 --> 02:08:12.480]   Rob Reed and I are collaborating on a podcast in support of his forthcoming book, After
[02:08:12.480 --> 02:08:13.480]   On.
[02:08:13.480 --> 02:08:20.320]   It's a story about AI and quantum computing set in the Bay Area and Silicon Valley.
[02:08:20.320 --> 02:08:26.800]   And so we're doing eight episodes where we talk with experts about the real ideas that
[02:08:26.800 --> 02:08:28.840]   underlie the things that he put in the book.
[02:08:28.840 --> 02:08:29.840]   A good idea.
[02:08:29.840 --> 02:08:31.360]   I just got my copy, by the way.
[02:08:31.360 --> 02:08:32.360]   Thank Rob.
[02:08:32.360 --> 02:08:35.200]   He's been on the shows before, I think he was on Twitter a few weeks ago talking about
[02:08:35.200 --> 02:08:36.200]   After On.
[02:08:36.200 --> 02:08:37.840]   That's a great idea for a show.
[02:08:37.840 --> 02:08:38.840]   I love that.
[02:08:38.840 --> 02:08:45.000]   Myron Gribitz, who is a CEO of Meta talking about augmented reality, Adam Gazzile, who's
[02:08:45.000 --> 02:08:46.760]   been on the cover of Nature.
[02:08:46.760 --> 02:08:54.200]   He's a neuroscientist talking about the way to hack your brain and all kinds of good
[02:08:54.200 --> 02:08:55.200]   stuff.
[02:08:55.200 --> 02:08:57.720]   We're going to try to get Nick Bostrom, Kevin Kelly is going to be on.
[02:08:57.720 --> 02:08:58.720]   Oh, fun.
[02:08:58.720 --> 02:09:00.680]   So yeah, it's just Cindy Cone from EFS.
[02:09:00.680 --> 02:09:02.120]   So is this the first episode?
[02:09:02.120 --> 02:09:03.120]   Yeah.
[02:09:03.120 --> 02:09:07.640]   So we're going to be launching it, I think, around mid-July.
[02:09:07.640 --> 02:09:08.640]   Keep an eye out.
[02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:09.640]   Okay.
[02:09:09.640 --> 02:09:14.040]   You can go to after-ton.com and Rob will keep you up to date.
[02:09:14.040 --> 02:09:17.880]   And it's just going to be good conversations about real concepts.
[02:09:17.880 --> 02:09:19.040]   And then I love his story.
[02:09:19.040 --> 02:09:20.040]   His story is great.
[02:09:20.040 --> 02:09:21.040]   Oh, yeah, it's great.
[02:09:21.040 --> 02:09:24.720]   And you and I are both on the audio book, which is going to be good to me too.
[02:09:24.720 --> 02:09:25.720]   Oh, that's right.
[02:09:25.720 --> 02:09:26.720]   I forgot I did that.
[02:09:26.720 --> 02:09:27.720]   Yeah.
[02:09:27.720 --> 02:09:29.320]   I'm the San Francisco Chronicle on it.
[02:09:29.320 --> 02:09:30.320]   Right.
[02:09:30.320 --> 02:09:31.320]   And I'm ours Technica.
[02:09:31.320 --> 02:09:32.320]   No wait, no.
[02:09:32.320 --> 02:09:33.320]   Is that right?
[02:09:33.320 --> 02:09:34.320]   Yeah, I think so.
[02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:36.280]   And then Tom's novel is out now.
[02:09:36.280 --> 02:09:37.280]   Right?
[02:09:37.280 --> 02:09:38.880]   You can get that right now.
[02:09:38.880 --> 02:09:42.960]   It's called Pilot X Time Travel Story, available wherever books are sold.
[02:09:42.960 --> 02:09:43.960]   Very nice.
[02:09:43.960 --> 02:09:44.960]   Pilot X.
[02:09:44.960 --> 02:09:46.960]   How is that?
[02:09:46.960 --> 02:09:51.160]   Do you like writing better than you like podcasting or do you need to do both?
[02:09:51.160 --> 02:09:52.680]   They're about the same.
[02:09:52.680 --> 02:09:57.000]   You know, I like podcasting when I want to chat and I like writing when I want to be
[02:09:57.000 --> 02:09:58.000]   alone.
[02:09:58.000 --> 02:10:00.680]   See, I think podcasting spoiled me for writing because it's so easy to talk.
[02:10:00.680 --> 02:10:02.160]   I can no longer write.
[02:10:02.160 --> 02:10:03.320]   It's like too much work.
[02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:04.320]   I just want to talk.
[02:10:04.320 --> 02:10:05.320]   Yeah, but that's why I write fiction.
[02:10:05.320 --> 02:10:06.320]   Ah.
[02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:07.320]   Podcasting is kind of my nonfiction.
[02:10:07.320 --> 02:10:08.320]   Got it.
[02:10:08.320 --> 02:10:09.320]   That's smart.
[02:10:09.320 --> 02:10:10.320]   Yeah.
[02:10:10.320 --> 02:10:11.560]   Every time I write fiction, it sounds stupid.
[02:10:11.560 --> 02:10:12.560]   So I stopped.
[02:10:12.560 --> 02:10:14.120]   That's why I got to keep doing it.
[02:10:14.120 --> 02:10:16.720]   Mine started stupid and now it's less stupid.
[02:10:16.720 --> 02:10:18.480]   No, I'm always like your stuff.
[02:10:18.480 --> 02:10:20.520]   Writing until it's no longer stupid.
[02:10:20.520 --> 02:10:21.520]   Yeah.
[02:10:21.520 --> 02:10:22.520]   Tom, great to have you.
[02:10:22.520 --> 02:10:23.520]   Thank you for joining us.
[02:10:23.520 --> 02:10:25.320]   Give my regards to Rob.
[02:10:25.320 --> 02:10:26.320]   Thanks, I will.
[02:10:26.320 --> 02:10:27.320]   All right.
[02:10:27.320 --> 02:10:29.840]   DTNS, the Daily Tech News Show.com.
[02:10:29.840 --> 02:10:33.760]   And of course, don't forget to follow them.
[02:10:33.760 --> 02:10:36.280]   The most memorable Twitter handle ever.
[02:10:36.280 --> 02:10:38.280]   A-C-E-D-T-E-C-T.
[02:10:38.280 --> 02:10:42.800]   If you'll work hard enough to spell it, you'll hopefully enjoy it.
[02:10:42.800 --> 02:10:43.800]   Great to have you, Tom.
[02:10:43.800 --> 02:10:44.800]   Good to see you again.
[02:10:44.800 --> 02:10:45.800]   Thank you, Jason Hunter.
[02:10:45.800 --> 02:10:46.800]   He came in at the last minute because...
[02:10:46.800 --> 02:10:48.080]   I made it back.
[02:10:48.080 --> 02:10:51.000]   Our scheduled guest Ashley Esquetha got to learn.
[02:10:51.000 --> 02:10:54.440]   She'll be back, but Jason's always great to have you on it or in chief at the time,
[02:10:54.440 --> 02:10:55.440]   Republic.
[02:10:55.440 --> 02:10:56.440]   Absolutely.
[02:10:56.440 --> 02:10:57.440]   Sorry.
[02:10:57.440 --> 02:10:59.040]   When you said back, I dropped and now I'm back.
[02:10:59.040 --> 02:11:00.280]   Well, that too.
[02:11:00.280 --> 02:11:02.280]   We got you back for that too.
[02:11:02.280 --> 02:11:03.280]   Thanks.
[02:11:03.280 --> 02:11:07.440]   And folks, I want to plug my book because both of you and Tom are in it.
[02:11:07.440 --> 02:11:12.040]   And so for fans of Tom Merritt and Leo LaPorte, follow the geeks.
[02:11:12.040 --> 02:11:18.720]   You can read their stories in full, along with the stories of many other amazing people.
[02:11:18.720 --> 02:11:21.320]   It's the closest thing I'm ever going to come to having a biography.
[02:11:21.320 --> 02:11:23.320]   So folks, read chapter 10.
[02:11:23.320 --> 02:11:24.920]   A highly recommended.
[02:11:24.920 --> 02:11:26.960]   Audible too.
[02:11:26.960 --> 02:11:29.640]   There's an Audible.
[02:11:29.640 --> 02:11:33.240]   I was the co-author of this book with Lindsey Gilpin.
[02:11:33.240 --> 02:11:37.960]   But in the Audible book, I actually read the audiobook.
[02:11:37.960 --> 02:11:44.720]   And the sample chapter in that is the beginning of Leo's chapter as well.
[02:11:44.720 --> 02:11:46.120]   That was nice of them.
[02:11:46.120 --> 02:11:47.120]   Yes.
[02:11:47.120 --> 02:11:48.680]   But don't think you're getting the whole thing.
[02:11:48.680 --> 02:11:50.320]   You got to buy the book.
[02:11:50.320 --> 02:11:51.320]   Yeah.
[02:11:51.320 --> 02:11:52.320]   Yeah.
[02:11:52.320 --> 02:11:53.320]   Yeah.
[02:11:53.320 --> 02:11:54.320]   It's so great to have you on Jason.
[02:11:54.320 --> 02:11:55.320]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:11:55.320 --> 02:11:58.280]   People who bought follow the geeks also bought Rob Reed's book and mine.
[02:11:58.280 --> 02:11:59.280]   Excellent.
[02:11:59.280 --> 02:12:00.280]   Look at that.
[02:12:00.280 --> 02:12:01.280]   All in the family.
[02:12:01.280 --> 02:12:02.280]   Isn't that weird?
[02:12:02.280 --> 02:12:03.280]   All in the family.
[02:12:03.280 --> 02:12:04.280]   And Daniel Suarez.
[02:12:04.280 --> 02:12:05.280]   And Daniel Suarez.
[02:12:05.280 --> 02:12:06.280]   I know.
[02:12:06.280 --> 02:12:07.280]   And Nick Bilton and Steven Levy.
[02:12:07.280 --> 02:12:09.280]   I didn't even see that.
[02:12:09.280 --> 02:12:10.280]   Look at that.
[02:12:10.280 --> 02:12:11.280]   Yep.
[02:12:11.280 --> 02:12:13.800]   What is the thread that ties all of those together?
[02:12:13.800 --> 02:12:14.800]   I ask you.
[02:12:14.800 --> 02:12:15.800]   Nerds.
[02:12:15.800 --> 02:12:16.800]   Nerds.
[02:12:16.800 --> 02:12:20.240]   And by the way, this guy, Brian Merritt, author of the One Devices Secret History of the
[02:12:20.240 --> 02:12:23.400]   iPhone, he's going to be on triangulation in a couple of weeks.
[02:12:23.400 --> 02:12:26.000]   So I'm just saying.
[02:12:26.000 --> 02:12:27.000]   Yep.
[02:12:27.000 --> 02:12:28.000]   Yeah.
[02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:29.000]   One connection is you, Leo.
[02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:31.600]   Well, I wasn't going to say it, but thank you.
[02:12:31.600 --> 02:12:36.520]   Oh, and JJ Stone actually is the single connecting thread that holds us all together.
[02:12:36.520 --> 02:12:41.360]   He is in fact the person that created the universe.
[02:12:41.360 --> 02:12:42.720]   I believe that's true.
[02:12:42.720 --> 02:12:44.960]   Secondly, just to hold one stuff.
[02:12:44.960 --> 02:12:48.000]   One, Jason, if I get you on cocktails and that will be.
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:49.000]   Oh, yeah.
[02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:50.000]   Leo's been on a cocktail.
[02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:51.000]   Don't do it.
[02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:52.000]   Tom, don't do it.
[02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:57.160]   He pulls stories out of you that you thought you'd long forgotten that you never wish anybody
[02:12:57.160 --> 02:12:58.160]   heard.
[02:12:58.160 --> 02:12:59.160]   Yes.
[02:12:59.160 --> 02:13:01.520]   She got Georgia Dow's real name out of her.
[02:13:01.520 --> 02:13:05.480]   And then we put it on the Internet and I was hoping to get into a tweet fight with Tom
[02:13:05.480 --> 02:13:07.000]   because Tom is one of those people.
[02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:09.600]   I love it just like Tom more than anything.
[02:13:09.600 --> 02:13:14.040]   I consider myself one of the wittiest, snappiest people in the world and Tom operates like
[02:13:14.040 --> 02:13:15.440]   two times asking me.
[02:13:15.440 --> 02:13:19.800]   It's kind of like, you know, I can't deal with somebody who's more a key wester, Key
[02:13:19.800 --> 02:13:20.800]   Largo, fast.
[02:13:20.800 --> 02:13:21.800]   I can't say.
[02:13:21.800 --> 02:13:25.840]   Oh, Doctor, we are all occluded in Tom Merritt's shadow.
[02:13:25.840 --> 02:13:26.840]   Exactly.
[02:13:26.840 --> 02:13:30.080]   It's just sickening about the way Tom Merritt is.
[02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:36.400]   Oh, anything you talk about Tom knows, Street, Daniel history, 1984, 17, 17, when did you know
[02:13:36.400 --> 02:13:37.840]   that it came in four parts?
[02:13:37.840 --> 02:13:38.840]   Tom makes me sick.
[02:13:38.840 --> 02:13:41.840]   But besides not me loving, eight in time, I love Tom, Tom knows.
[02:13:41.840 --> 02:13:43.600]   I'm going to just tell you all something about the Internet.
[02:13:43.600 --> 02:13:44.600]   Okay.
[02:13:44.600 --> 02:13:46.440]   A lot of people are in tech listening to the show.
[02:13:46.440 --> 02:13:48.960]   And if you're living out in bro country, stop being a bro.
[02:13:48.960 --> 02:13:50.040]   We were talking about the Uber thing.
[02:13:50.040 --> 02:13:51.480]   We kind of breeze by it.
[02:13:51.480 --> 02:13:52.920]   But I have a daughter.
[02:13:52.920 --> 02:13:54.320]   You have a mother.
[02:13:54.320 --> 02:13:55.720]   Everybody who's listening to this has a mother.
[02:13:55.720 --> 02:13:59.840]   If you see somebody being a bro, if you're in a hedge fund tech fund startup and you
[02:13:59.840 --> 02:14:03.160]   see these dudes acting crazy, first thing you do is check them.
[02:14:03.160 --> 02:14:05.920]   Go to him be like, yo, dude, she's got a job to do.
[02:14:05.920 --> 02:14:07.160]   It's not cool to do that.
[02:14:07.160 --> 02:14:11.240]   Then secondly, maybe you check with her if he continues to do it so you can support her
[02:14:11.240 --> 02:14:13.760]   where she goes to HR and they ignore her.
[02:14:13.760 --> 02:14:17.920]   So there's a man standing behind her because you can't just accept that culture and living
[02:14:17.920 --> 02:14:21.680]   that world and spend all that money and let people do what they want to do and get away
[02:14:21.680 --> 02:14:22.680]   with it.
[02:14:22.680 --> 02:14:23.680]   It's not right.
[02:14:23.680 --> 02:14:24.680]   It's wrong.
[02:14:24.680 --> 02:14:25.680]   It's over and over again.
[02:14:25.680 --> 02:14:28.560]   And we have the hope to Jim and he christmas somebody listens to a woman.
[02:14:28.560 --> 02:14:32.360]   There's too many men working in these environments, not backing these women up and it makes me
[02:14:32.360 --> 02:14:33.360]   sick.
[02:14:33.360 --> 02:14:35.680]   That's what I wanted to say earlier, but I try to comment down, but it's just made me
[02:14:35.680 --> 02:14:36.680]   mad along.
[02:14:36.680 --> 02:14:37.680]   I say, I love you.
[02:14:37.680 --> 02:14:38.680]   Love the show.
[02:14:38.680 --> 02:14:39.680]   Thanks for having me on.
