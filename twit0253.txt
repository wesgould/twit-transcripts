[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.920]   This is Twit.
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.440]   This week in tech, the show that covers the latest tech
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.280]   news, the week's big stories and the big story this week.
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.320]   Well, there's really only two of them.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.560]   iPhone and E3.
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.040]   And so we brought in a bunch of people who have iPhones.
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.120]   They were successfully ordered iPhones and were at E3.
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.960]   It's kind of an amazing coincidence.
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.640]   Intersection.
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.960]   Starting with Jeff Kursman, I'm really happy to have you on.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.080]   Hey, it's great to be here, Lee.
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.880]   If you need to have Jeff on for ages,
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.200]   he is a longtime gaming reporter.
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.720]   Started with GameSpot.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.200]   You've worked everywhere.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.120]   And your current site is giantbomb.com.
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.360]   That's right.
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.080]   What does giantbomb.com do?
[00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.080]   Well, we have a whole editorial side.
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.560]   We're going around making videos about games and telling
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.240]   people what to be.
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.600]   You were at E3.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.960]   You're looking big.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.160]   Yes, definitely.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.080]   This is a big E3.
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.960]   Hard and been to all of them.
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:23.920]   Every E3.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.360]   But we also have a huge Wiki database on the site.
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.360]   People want to delve into the history of gaming and say,
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.680]   show me every game that takes place in space or show me
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.440]   every game that has grass in it or player controlled graffiti.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.320]   Is there a game that has Abe Lincoln in a space suit, though?
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.600]   That's Lincoln Force.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.120]   So we have nothing to announce about Lincoln Force at this time.
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.640]   OK.
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.680]   Nice.
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.800]   Thank you, Jeff, for being here.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.720]   It's really nice to see you.
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.800]   Jeff lives in Petaluma.
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.760]   So it's ridiculous that you haven't been on before.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.080]   Hoped at my car and rolled over here.
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.400]   So very fantastic.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.440]   Really nice to have you.
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.240]   Also with us today from LA and the host of the Totally Rad Show.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.160]   Another guy who's-- I don't think ever been on to it before.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.800]   Jeff Kanata.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.840]   Hey, Jeff.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.520]   Actually, one year ago, I was here for E3 last year.
[00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.920]   That's right.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.160]   We did it last year.
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.640]   That's right.
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.160]   Do the same thing as a matter of fact.
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.480]   Yes, I'm excited to be back in my yearly appointment.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.120]   I'm going to get you on more often.
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.400]   We ran into Jeff and we were covering E3 outside the Wiltern
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.680]   Theater where the Microsoft announcement was.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.280]   So it's really--
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.840]   Yeah, I walked out with my brand new Xbox.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.720]   I've been promised to me and everybody was jealous.
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:24.640]   Standing outside.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.200]   Yeah.
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.240]   Well, you all you got was a coupon, though, right?
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.840]   Yeah.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.000]   A promise is what we got.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.440]   You got a promise of an Xbox 360.
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.000]   Also with this really good-- always
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.920]   glad to have her on Veronica Belmont, our good friend from
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.760]   techzilla.com and the host of Core on the Sony PlayStation
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.280]   3 and blogger at VeronicaBelmont.com.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.360]   Hi, Veronica.
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.120]   Hi, how are you?
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.720]   Jeff Fun at E3.
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:48.720]   Oh, big time.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.480]   Yeah.
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.160]   It was a good trip.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.880]   I think it was a really good year.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.800]   This is the first E3 I've been to in many, many years.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.120]   I went to the first E3s because my friend,
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.360]   Gina Smith, who was editor in chief of the time of Electronic
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.480]   Entertainment Magazine, they started E3.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.880]   Right.
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:03.240]   Yeah.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.960]   Way back when.
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.480]   And I went to the first few shows.
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.960]   I remember what a big deal that was.
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:07.440]   Yeah, it was huge.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.000]   I mean, they were breaking off from CES.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.280]   And gaming wasn't really getting the respect it deserved
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.120]   at CES.
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.760]   Remember Vegas?
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:13.880]   They just put it out in that big tent.
[00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:14.560]   And it was horrible.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.760]   And howling wind.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.960]   And so it was finally like, here was gaming, making a stand
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:21.120]   and saying, we matter now.
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.480]   Here we are.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.880]   It was 14 years later, 15 years later.
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.680]   It's been kind of up and down though for E3,
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.080]   because for a while, didn't they kind of end the trade show
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.200]   and say, it's just going to be press conferences and open
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.800]   to the--
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.160]   Yeah.
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.120]   When my first E3 was the Santa Monica year,
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.120]   it was all in hotel rooms around the town.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.960]   And a giant hanger.
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.440]   I was like, wow, this is it, huh?
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.120]   Yeah, they had to scale it back.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.160]   Because it got too big.
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.680]   There were too many people getting in that they had
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.840]   loosened the credentials so far at that point
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.120]   that if you actually wanted to get worked on at the show,
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.080]   you were just like crowd surfing over all these people
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.880]   to get to your appointments and stuff.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.760]   Yeah, it was about fire breathing women and scantily
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.160]   clad outfits and giant spectacle on the show floor,
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.480]   rather than--
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.760]   Well, it's back, baby, because that's exactly what it was.
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.320]   But the attendance was a little bit lower.
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.000]   So there's just enough breathing room
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.040]   to get where you need to get.
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.840]   It seems like they've struck a happy balance
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.600]   with the exception of having press conferences coincide
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.840]   with actual floor time.
[00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.160]   I think Sony gets the short end of the stick on that one.
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.920]   But other than that, well, hassle.
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:17.720]   It's a pretty good show.
[00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.200]   Yeah, you could actually walk around a little bit.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.960]   It was very nice.
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.960]   Much different from CES, where you still
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.640]   have to elbow people out of the way
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.400]   to get from one booth to another.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.240]   I just try not to go to CES anymore.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.440]   It just scares me.
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.600]   Well, E3, as I said, I hadn't been sent for 14 years
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.200]   or something like that.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.240]   And I kind of didn't know exactly what to expect.
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.800]   I thought it was fantastic.
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.080]   I mean, the entertainment aspect of this is so important.
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.280]   It really is Hollywood.
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:42.920]   It's not.
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.160]   And this, for us, was a challenge.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:45.840]   Because at Twit, we're really geeks.
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.600]   We cover technology.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.880]   And gaming isn't so much about technology.
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:50.080]   Yeah.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.160]   And you went on the year where everyone was dancing,
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.040]   every five feet.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.080]   So you definitely went on an interesting year.
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.840]   Well, I would say this year was more about technology
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.000]   than maybe previous years have been.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.920]   Well, thanks to Microsoft and Connect.
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.360]   Thanks to Sony Move.
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.720]   Thanks to Nintendo 3DS.
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:09.400]   Those three things, that was hardware.
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.720]   It was a hardware show for those three anyway.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.360]   Yeah, and the whole idea of 3D arriving in a big way
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.080]   in the consumer space at E3, that's a lot about technology.
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.960]   And whose technology is going to work best,
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.920]   whether it's the 3DS in their 3D without glasses
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:29.760]   or Sony's big push for televisions and 3D glasses
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.200]   that you have to plug in or charge.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.560]   It's a lot of different choices.
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.800]   Well, let's talk about the 3DS.
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:36.720]   I take it.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:38.720]   I wasn't able to touch one.
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.840]   We actually, there was a big wall and a long line.
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.000]   I was only there on Tuesday.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.240]   So there was a long ass line going all the way around.
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.440]   So all we could do, Brian Brushwood, I got on my knees,
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.720]   and Brian Brushwood got on my back
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.080]   and peered over the wall with a camera.
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.440]   So that's the closest I've got.
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.920]   That's a picture I want to see.
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:00.000]   Well, just watch our feed live.tv.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.120]   You'll see it.
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.280]   Not something I'm proud of, but--
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.480]   No, you've got to get the story.
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.280]   You've got to get the story.
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.760]   Got to make it happen, no matter what.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.680]   A very nice Japanese lady from Nintendo came over and said,
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.680]   what the hell are you doing?
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.680]   Get down.
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.480]   Get down.
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.720]   Down, boy.
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.680]   So we didn't really get a hands on.
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:18.760]   Did you guys-- Veronica, did you play with the 3DS at all?
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.160]   No, I didn't get a chance to.
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.120]   Like I said, I was only on the show floor for about three
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.920]   or four hours, and Nintendo was not one of the stops
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.080]   I was able to make.
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:28.560]   It's one of the worst things in the world
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.360]   is to work a conference like this,
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.040]   because you don't get to see it.
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.400]   You don't get to be a spectator.
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.680]   You're too busy covering it.
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.360]   So you were covering it for core?
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.680]   Yeah, we were there, and we had an offsite interview space.
[00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.680]   So people were coming to us, so we didn't have to work
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.080]   with the crowds and have to deal with all the noise.
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.000]   And it worked out great, but the downside was the only hands
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.240]   on time with stuff I got was when people brought builds
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.000]   to our hotel suite.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.200]   So I didn't get a chance to try out the 3DS, unfortunately.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.920]   How about I think that's really a shame,
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:00.080]   because for me, seeing was believing with 3DS.
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.080]   I was pretty skeptical going in.
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:02.920]   I'm very skeptical.
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.320]   It sounds like virtual, boy, to me.
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.560]   It didn't--
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.880]   It really delivers.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.320]   It's pretty amazing technology as far as I'm concerned.
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.760]   I was able to play with it for a while
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.600]   and see some of the tech demos that they were showing.
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.760]   They weren't really showing full games yet.
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.760]   And so there's a little bit of remains
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.920]   to be seen about what full games will be like.
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.400]   But the tech demos that they were showing
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:23.640]   were very impressive.
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:28.520]   And the 3D, while you have to really hold it in one place,
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.000]   still does work.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.960]   And it's remarkable.
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.440]   I mean, you have the slider on the side
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:37.000]   so you can adjust how much 3D it's giving you.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   But when you find that sweet spot,
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.360]   it really does deliver both looking into the screen
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.120]   and popping out from the screen.
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.160]   Now, you can't tilt it at all, right?
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.200]   Well, the weird thing is it actually
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.760]   has a tilt sensor in the console.
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:51.200]   So they'll be able to make games where you'll
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.800]   be doing the accelerometer stuff and tilting it around.
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.920]   But you have to stay focused directly on that screen
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:57.520]   for it to work.
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.760]   And for me, the sweet spot ended up
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.200]   being a little closer to my face than I would have liked.
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.800]   And I kind of messed around with the slider for about 15 minutes
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.840]   before I found something that seemed reasonably comfortable.
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.200]   And even then, it felt like it was working great.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.800]   But at any point, it could fall apart.
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.720]   And that was kind of the scary thing for me.
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:14.880]   But it is impressive, right, Jeff?
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:15.720]   I mean, definitely.
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.840]   Like, once you get going, it's like no glasses.
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:18.880]   It's awesome.
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:21.120]   Well, that's the thing that's great about having it be a handheld.
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.160]   Is that unlike a console where you're
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.480]   going to be in different parts of the room
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.800]   when you're playing sometimes, especially
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.840]   with a multiplayer kind of experience?
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.680]   With a handheld, your face is in it anyway.
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.880]   I mean, you're already kind of looking at it in a direct on manner.
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.840]   They've been working on this technology over at Nintendo
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.280]   for like three years now, I think.
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:41.080]   And I've read somewhere that the 3DS is almost as powerful
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.160]   as a GameCube.
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.920]   I think it was, or has the processing power,
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.360]   of an actual older Nintendo console.
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.240]   So that's pretty neat.
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.120]   Yeah, I think visually that pans out.
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:50.120]   I mean, if you look at what they're
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.720]   showing for the new Kid Icarus game and what they're showing for,
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.600]   there's a Metal Gear Solid 3 kind of non-interactive demo.
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.760]   Like, you look at that stuff, you look at the texture quality
[00:09:58.760 --> 00:09:59.000]   and stuff.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.440]   It's like, yeah, it's right around GameCube quality
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.680]   somewhere around PSP or PS2 quality as well.
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.280]   And it's definitely a big step up from the original DS.
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.480]   And if you're the sort of person that hates 3D,
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:12.560]   the great thing about it is you can actually just turn 3D all the way off
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.480]   and just get great looking 2D games with a wider screen.
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.280]   It's just a better DS at that point.
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.480]   How does this work?
[00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.640]   Does anybody know?
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.320]   Interlacing two images and flash them, I think.
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:23.680]   It's like the 3D camera.
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.600]   It's not ridiculous.
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.080]   It's not going to come out.
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.760]   It's not using a lens or something to do it.
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.080]   Because I guess it's a lens that you're doing a slider.
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.520]   I can see it in TV more.
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:32.520]   The tricky thing.
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:35.440]   And so anybody was listening and saying, oh, great.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:39.040]   Finally, I can get rid of my glasses on my TV or in the movie.
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.040]   No.
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.000]   Because only one person at a time can see 3D.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:43.520]   Right.
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.400]   So that's why I think it's a lens of some kind.
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:50.120]   In the THQ booth, unbeknownst to most people
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:53.120]   kind of tucked away without much hollaballoo,
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:58.120]   was a full-size television that didn't require glasses.
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:10:58.960]   And that's right.
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.320]   But your field of vision still has to be pretty dead on.
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:02.720]   You can't move around too much.
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.800]   You have to be in front.
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.320]   They said they had nine viewpoints.
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:06.160]   That's lenticular.
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:06.640]   Oh, wow.
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:07.640]   It would work.
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:08.160]   It would work.
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.160]   It would work.
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:10.160]   And I saw it.
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.160]   And then it wouldn't work.
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:12.160]   You know, it's funny.
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:13.160]   I went to a booth at CES.
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:14.160]   I think it was a Sony booth.
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:15.160]   They had this.
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.160]   And then immediately went out.
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.400]   And there was an ad monitor on that.
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.400]   We had the same thing.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.400]   It's lenticular.
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:21.400]   You've seen it before.
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:22.400]   You've seen it out of the cover of National Geographic.
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:23.400]   It's lent.
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:25.520]   And there are only certain spots where you get 3D.
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.280]   You can't move out of that spot.
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:28.280]   I'm sorry.
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:34.520]   Glassesless 3D is not coming to movies unless you hold it on an intended 3DS and don't move.
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:35.520]   Yeah.
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:38.400]   And they were showing us some movie trailers and stuff like that that, you know, most
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:39.760]   of it looked pretty sharp as well.
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:44.560]   So you have to wonder like if that's a significant way for people to get 3D movies in the home
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:48.640]   if they can't afford to go out and get the TV and the 3D Blu-ray player and all that stuff.
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.680]   Although they're not really talking about how they're going to deliver that.
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:52.680]   Yeah.
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:54.400]   That's a download or a cartridge or what.
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:59.520]   But I think the interesting thing about the 3DS is, you know, the top screen is the only
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.000]   screen that's going to be in 3D.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.040]   And the bottom screen is the only screen that has touch.
[00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.040]   And they said--
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.040]   Well, that's the holograms on the bottom part later.
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:08.040]   That's the next one.
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:11.480]   So just like you'll have Princess Leia standing on the screen.
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.360]   Time traveler 2 gets Sega on the phone.
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.360]   Let's do this.
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.840]   I'm ready for that.
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:20.880]   But you know, I think that most of the games that are on DS now that use touch input, use
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:26.800]   that bottom screen as the main game screen and where the 3DS clearly the top screen is
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.720]   made to be the main game screen.
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:33.800]   So I think it's actually going to push developers to develop completely new types of games as
[00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.760]   well as just using the 3D.
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:40.480]   I think it's a much more revolutionary device for Nintendo than we might think at first
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:41.480]   glance.
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:42.640]   Plus it has an analog stick on it.
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.120]   You know, at first glance, it kind of looks like the old NES Max or like, you know, just
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.120]   a bigger PSP now.
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:49.880]   But that thing actually feels very nice and slides around.
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:52.320]   So it does kind of open them up to those types of games.
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:55.320]   I want to know like 1% of the population that gets a really terrible migraine every
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.480]   time I try to use 3D.
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:02.400]   So this whole this whole trend going on right now is a little bit worrisome to me.
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:06.000]   So according to some, and I don't know if Nintendo's revealed this or not, they're
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:14.920]   using a technology called Parallax Barrier, which essentially is a slitted layer placed
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:19.280]   over a standard LCD screen that separates the image into separate life paths.
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:23.280]   That's why you could have a slider because, for the viewers right and left eyes.
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:27.560]   So the slider, I guess, converges those if you don't want any 3D or separates them if
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:28.720]   you do.
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:33.920]   It's been around for on mobile phones for as long as eight years.
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:38.200]   You have to stay still and you can only be in one place if you want it to work.
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.680]   So it's really for one viewer.
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:40.680]   Great for a game.
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:41.680]   Goodbye.
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.600]   Yeah, they were showing off a tech demo called Facease that I guess was kind of an augmented
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.600]   reality thing.
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:48.640]   You know, you take a picture of your face and map it onto a ball.
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:51.880]   And then you'd have to look around and shoot the balls as they were coming at you.
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:54.560]   So you're like looking through and just using the 3D camera.
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:58.880]   So you're getting a 3D view of the actual environment around you as these targets are
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.400]   kind of flying in your face and stuff.
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.400]   And that was definitely...
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.600]   That's from one of your items actually says, "Facease."
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:05.600]   The Ace is a face.
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.600]   You know, Ace is a face.
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.600]   You'll face.
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.600]   You'll face.
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:09.600]   They're getting Ace of Base as a license.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.600]   License artist for it.
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.600]   So no, they're not.
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.640]   I mean, the fact that it has two cameras and allows you to take 3D pictures.
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:18.560]   And I think Jeff, you're absolutely right, that this Facease while it was just a tech
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:20.880]   demo, the idea of that.
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:21.880]   Yeah.
[00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:26.240]   Kind of throwing things into 3D and using the camera to place that into the real world
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:31.720]   and using what you're actually looking at through the device to build a game world.
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:35.960]   I think that's extremely exciting and completely unlike anything we've ever been able to do
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:36.960]   before.
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.920]   Definitely more exciting than 3D on consoles, I think too.
[00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:43.080]   You know, there's just a lot of different and really crazy possibilities that they can
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.080]   get into with this stuff.
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:46.480]   So when's it out and how much?
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:47.840]   They've been kind of bulking at that.
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:51.320]   The last they said is that it would be out, I guess, like this fiscal year in Japan and
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:54.600]   before March 2011 in the US, but they weren't really talking price.
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.600]   There's a ways off.
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:56.600]   Yeah.
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:59.160]   And what games did you like the best that you played?
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:03.000]   Well, I mean, a lot of them were non-interactive demos and stuff.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.040]   So it was like, "Hey, take a look at this Metal Gear thing."
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.720]   It's very pan the camera around.
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:08.960]   Yeah, it was very early.
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:13.480]   They did announce a Star Fox game and were showing that and talking about kind of their
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:18.280]   classic franchises and finally bringing Kid Icarus back, which I know a lot of the Nintendo
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:21.920]   faithful have been demanding for over a decade now.
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.400]   I just find it very intriguing.
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.440]   I mean, for a while, we were writing Nintendo off.
[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:30.760]   And today at E3, everybody was just playing catch up, basically.
[00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:32.640]   And Nintendo took another leap forward.
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:33.640]   Yeah, for sure.
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:35.160]   That's exactly right.
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.160]   Yeah.
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.440]   You know, everyone's got their own motion control trickery now.
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:44.240]   And when you think back to the GameCube era where Nintendo was squarely in third place
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:49.600]   and kind of scrambling, and there was a lot of rumors of them being acquired by Microsoft
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:56.000]   or them abandoning hardware manufacturing completely and just going software like Sega
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.360]   did, and here we are one generation later and they are in the dominant position.
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:05.280]   Everybody is trying to get the market share that they sort of invented.
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:08.440]   You know, the people that don't play games usually are buying Wii and droves.
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.440]   Right.
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:12.160]   And they've really turned it around on the developer side as well.
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.360]   When the DS was first released, he had a lot of skepticism from developers.
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:19.160]   And I'm like, I don't know how this two screen touch screen thing is going to work, but everyone
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:23.280]   I talked to about 3DS stuff, I mean, because it is just car largely an advancement from
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:26.440]   the original DS, they're already extremely excited about building games.
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:29.920]   There's a huge list of games already in development for it.
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:34.320]   And they're even porting stuff like Ocarina of Time, which is one of the most popular video
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.320]   because of all time.
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.320]   That was one of my favorites.
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:39.400]   And they showed us a demo of that and it looked really good.
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:40.400]   It looked really exciting.
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:41.840]   Yeah, all new assets and stuff.
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:42.840]   Yeah.
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:43.840]   Cool.
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.880]   Well, Microsoft came up with an innovation of their own, which did feel a little bit like
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:50.800]   a carbon copy, but we'll talk about Connect in just a little bit.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.240]   Our guests today are gaming panel.
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.240]   Couldn't be better.
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.920]   Jeff Gersman, Giant Bomb.com.
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:00.320]   Jeff Kanata from The Totally Rad Show and reviews on the run.
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:01.320]   It was fun.
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:02.320]   We saw Victor Lucas out there.
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.960]   I hadn't seen Victor in a long, long time.
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.120]   It was really neat to see.
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:08.760]   Veronica Belmont from Tekzilla and Core.
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.400]   Great to have all three of you on the show today.
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.240]   It was a Jeff's explosion.
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.240]   It's a Jeff's explosion.
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:18.000]   You should change your name to Jeff, Veronica, and then it'd be really confusing.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   I'll do that.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   Jeffa.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   Just totally confusing.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   Veronica.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   Veronica.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.840]   I do want to mention one of our great sponsors, Carbonite.com, the backup solution that is
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:32.480]   a must-have for anybody who's got a computer.
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:37.720]   Abby's going to college this fall and you better believe along with a Mac laptop that
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:40.400]   she's going to be bringing Carbonite.com along with her.
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.920]   Carbonite is backup done the way you ought to do it.
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:46.560]   If you're going to design it by scratch, what would you say?
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:50.720]   You'd say, first of all, it should be automatic so you don't have to remember to backup.
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:55.280]   You'd also say, perhaps it should back up off-site because truthfully, a backup isn't
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:58.040]   a backup if it's sitting right next to the original.
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.040]   What happens if there's a fire or a flutter?
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:03.040]   It's a quaket.
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.040]   You've lost everything.
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:08.520]   Carbonite automatically backs up your most precious data to the cloud.
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:13.440]   You might not say this, but I would say it should be inexpensive and Carbonite is.
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:17.040]   All of the personal data on your internal drive for less than five bucks a month.
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.520]   I'm going to put it on there.
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:19.520]   Abby won't even know it's on there.
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:22.960]   Just whenever she goes around, she's connected to Wi-Fi or whatever.
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:26.560]   Carbonite will start backing up over 128-bit SSL.
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.880]   Her stuff is safe and secure.
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.560]   She calls and I know she will saying, "I lost my paper.
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:32.760]   The dog ate my homework.
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:33.760]   The Mac crashed."
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.080]   I'll say, "Don't worry.
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:36.480]   We got it all."
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:37.480]   Carbonite is great.
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:39.960]   In another respect, you can get that file back anywhere you can get online.
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:41.920]   You don't even have the original computer.
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:45.760]   There's an iPhone app, a BlackBerry app, or you can just go to carbonite.com with your
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.200]   account and log in and there's your file.
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:52.480]   On PCs, it'll save up to 90 days' worth of previous versions too.
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:55.320]   Mac or PC, carbonite.com is the backup solution.
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:56.320]   Try it free.
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:58.360]   For 15 days, you don't even need a credit card.
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:03.680]   Just go to carbonite.com and use the offer code TWIT, T-W-I-T.
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:06.280]   If you decide to buy, I want you to try it.
[00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:10.960]   One of the things we ask of all our sponsors is, "Give us a free trial."
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.440]   You got to try it.
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:16.840]   Then if you decide to buy it, two months free, which really makes us a good deal.
[00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:19.440]   Carbonite.com, offer code TWIT.
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:22.520]   It's backup done right.
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:27.160]   I got up very early in the morning on Tuesday morning to see Connect.
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:29.760]   First, let's talk about the night before.
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.440]   Anybody go to the crazy Microsoft party?
[00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:33.440]   I did.
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.440]   Jeff, tell me.
[00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.440]   I missed it.
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:40.320]   The one where you had to wear a white poncho with LED light up space-
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:41.320]   Shoulder pads.
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:42.520]   We actually smuggled one of those out.
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:43.520]   Did you?
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.840]   And for our podcast, I ended up wearing it the whole first night.
[00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:46.840]   Why aren't you wearing it now?
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:48.920]   I want to see the space poncho.
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:49.920]   It's somewhere in...
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:51.440]   I don't know if it made it out of Los Angeles or not.
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.280]   Did you think you were going to a Gallagher show?
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:54.280]   Tell the truth.
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.280]   Yeah, I was hoping we were in the first three rows of...
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:57.280]   Watermelon.
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:58.280]   You don't want to hold in place.
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:19:59.280]   You have to be careful.
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:02.880]   I hear that if you find something and take it with you, even if you're a journalist,
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.480]   it still might be against the law.
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:05.480]   No.
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:06.480]   He found it on a bar stool.
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.480]   No, it's a set.
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:08.480]   It's a set on a bar stool.
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:09.480]   And yeah.
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:10.480]   Now we'll see how it goes.
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.160]   I got Microsoft on the phone.
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.080]   They want their poncho back.
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:16.880]   There's proprietary technology in that poncho.
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:19.080]   See me in hell for your poncho case.
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:20.080]   Oh, he is, actually.
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.560]   See, I read the funniest post.
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:22.560]   I was actually at...
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:28.080]   We went over to the Galen Center the next morning to get a demo of Connect.
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.160]   It was kind of like trash.
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:35.760]   There was the stand where they had the band up in the air and everybody was exhausted.
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:39.720]   I went online and I read the crunch gear piece, which was hysterical.
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:43.600]   The review of the night before and I thought, "Wow, I'm glad I missed that."
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.960]   They ended up putting the whole show on again the next night.
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:46.960]   They did?
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:47.960]   Because they were taping it for television.
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:49.360]   The whole thing aired on MTV on Tuesday.
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:50.360]   You did?
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:52.520]   I guess only three times they're ever going to perform that.
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:55.960]   Three times and it was developed completely for Microsoft and it's never going to happen
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:56.960]   again.
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:58.560]   If you caught it, you got a special thing.
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:20:59.560]   How much?
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:00.720]   But was it good is the question.
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:06.560]   Well, the rigmarole leading up to it was ridiculous and actually pretty frustrating from
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:07.720]   my point of view.
[00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:11.200]   But the actual show itself, I got to admit, kind of cool.
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:15.480]   If you're into Cirque du Soleil stuff, the grandeur of what they were doing, flipping
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:21.200]   a family upside down and giant rotating living room and having an elephant walk through the
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:24.720]   crowd that lit up with images of technology on it.
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:25.960]   It's kind of cool.
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.240]   Some cool stuff.
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:30.720]   It's a little odd for a company like Microsoft, don't you think?
[00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:32.360]   Maybe that's the point.
[00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:33.360]   I don't know.
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.360]   I haven't seen their stuff at other E3s.
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:35.600]   Do they always do weird stuff at E3?
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:40.000]   It's usually not this weird and this seemed very focused for the television audience at
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   home.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.440]   They air this thing commercial free so they basically just bought infomercial space across
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.440]   MTV and a bunch of other networks.
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:52.400]   Curiously timed to air right across the Sony press conference.
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.120]   So I don't know.
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:59.880]   We had invites to go and half of us and I was out at a pre-show event and started hearing
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.720]   more and more from other people like, "I hear they're going to confiscate cell phones
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.960]   at the door because they don't want people taking pictures of this thing."
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:09.440]   I heard this and I heard that and by the time we had heard the name of the thing and
[00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:12.480]   the basic parts of what was going to be shown, we ended up going to Roscoe's and getting
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.880]   chicken and waffles instead.
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:17.480]   I wish I'd known there was a chicken and waffles expedition.
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:18.960]   I would have gone to that.
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:22.320]   That was definitely a victory for our side.
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:29.440]   I think that seems so odd is that here you have an invited audience of very jaded, cynical
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:35.200]   cool kids who can't wait to write something snarky about Microsoft and then you put them
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:41.360]   through this bizarre process where half of them are down on the show floor interacting
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:47.040]   with these creatures and forced to participate in like...
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.040]   In pachos!
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:50.840]   Look at the wood nymphs.
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:51.840]   What's the wood that pachos?
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:52.840]   What was the point of that?
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.000]   Well the shoulders lit up.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.600]   So basically they were RFID tags and something so they could have them light up in patterns
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.240]   across the crowd.
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:03.480]   And so they made the audience part of the show.
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:08.440]   Someone theorized that it was all also to prevent any kind of logos from t-shirts.
[00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:16.320]   I thought they were making some kind of consistent background for making it like a giant projector
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:20.800]   screen or just a kind of weird green screen thing.
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:21.800]   But no.
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:25.400]   Well the moment that all the shoulder pads lit up was pretty cool.
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:29.120]   Because you guys didn't know they were going to light up.
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:33.260]   And so we ripped that thing apart and there's one of the breadboards in there that says
[00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:34.520]   "pick smob" on it.
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:35.520]   P-I-X-M-O-B.
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:38.160]   It's just like an open source kind of projector or whatever.
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:41.760]   So there is, there is some, you know, and this might be used in other places.
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:43.720]   For a "pick smob".
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:44.720]   Hmmm.
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:48.040]   It was kind of like being at the opening ceremonies for E3.
[00:23:48.040 --> 00:23:49.040]   I think it was.
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.960]   You expected to see a ribbon cutting or something like that.
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.920]   It was the opening ceremonies for E3.
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:54.920]   Yeah.
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.520]   Did they have lining a torch of some kind?
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:24:00.760]   Dan and I are chatroom saying they had these super secret Illuminati symbols from the Facebook
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:01.760]   people on the inside.
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:02.760]   Yeah.
[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:07.400]   Or you know they are going to like hand out Nike's at some point and take us to space.
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.400]   They are coming.
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:12.400]   So was it a success in the sense that it got you all excited about?
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:13.400]   Connect?
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.400]   No.
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:17.800]   Everything that I heard, you know, I was just like looking at Twitter the whole time as
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:21.080]   it's going on and just reading from everyone else who was there just going like "I can't
[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:22.480]   believe they are putting us through this.
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.760]   Like this is the silliest looking thing in the world."
[00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:27.560]   And all the gameplay was faked.
[00:24:27.560 --> 00:24:31.760]   So you know as like an actual like press event like "We want hard data" it was not that
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:32.760]   at all.
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:35.880]   So I feel like there was a lot more connecting it than I actually expected there to be.
[00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:39.160]   I kind of just thought it was going to be a Cirque du Soleil show and at the end, you
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:40.160]   know, "Try connect!"
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:43.080]   But there was actually- That would have been fun.
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:44.080]   I wouldn't like that.
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:45.080]   Yeah.
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:49.280]   It was actually the dance to be in Showcase thing and unveiling it much more than I thought
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:50.800]   it was going to be.
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:56.400]   I have to say I was very- and actually we saw the video of you Veronica a year ago playing
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:57.400]   with Project Mattel.
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:58.400]   You were the first to use, weren't you?
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.200]   No, I think you're thinking of Felicia.
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.200]   Oh, it's Felicia Day.
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.200]   I confuse you two all the time.
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:05.400]   But thanks, I'll take those compliments.
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:08.280]   So Felicia Day, that's right, was playing it.
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:13.560]   But now that I was very skeptical, I thought, first of all, you look like an idiot.
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:16.600]   Second of all, you know, it's just copying the Nintendo Wii moat.
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:17.960]   That just goes for me wherever I go.
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:21.800]   Yeah, I have to say I played it 5.30 in the morning.
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:23.000]   I played the River Raffy thing.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   It was fun.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   I worked up a sweat.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   I had a good time.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   It's actually quite entertaining.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.640]   I think Microsoft might have a hit with this.
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:30.640]   That thing works.
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:31.640]   It works.
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:32.640]   The best thing you can say about it.
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:36.560]   I think, you know, for me, the best experience, the best game they had going was Dance Central,
[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:41.960]   which is a harmonics, the guys from the behind rock band, making their crazy dancing game.
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:45.280]   And I think it works better than a lot of the rest because it doesn't map your movements
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:46.280]   to an on-screen character.
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:49.040]   So you can't see like, I mean, the movement gets a little...
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:53.640]   That's shown you had a game very similar where they put you in the screen while you're
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:54.640]   doing this.
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:55.640]   Yeah.
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:56.640]   With the move controllers.
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:57.640]   That looks a little dorky.
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:58.640]   Yeah.
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:25:59.640]   Yeah, a little bit.
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:02.880]   You're seeing motion-capped animated dancing and trying to match it.
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:05.880]   So it's not really representing you in all of this.
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:09.440]   You kind of get a little detached and don't have to think about, wow, that's actually
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:10.600]   what I look like right now.
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:11.600]   Oh my God.
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:12.600]   What am I doing?
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:15.120]   But a lot of the stuff when they're mapping it to avatars, that's where it starts to
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:16.120]   look weird.
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:19.440]   It's like, I'm raising my hand and you can see the input lag in front of you.
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:22.600]   You raise your hands and then a split second later.
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:24.240]   Oh, so there was a little lag on it.
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.080]   Nothing you wouldn't expect.
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:28.440]   It seemed very similar to a Wii remote or something.
[00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:29.520]   I didn't feel a lot of lag.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.800]   I was impressed with the lack of latency.
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:33.240]   That could kill something like that.
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:36.840]   I think as long as the games are developed with wide enough timing windows, it'll work
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:37.840]   itself out.
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:41.000]   Yeah, I think the technology is very impressive.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.360]   It's just the application of the technology this year didn't seem very impressive.
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:49.400]   Last year they came out and said, we have this thing called Project Natal.
[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:51.400]   It's the next step in technology.
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:55.280]   It's like nothing you've seen before and we're really going to create an experience that
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:59.720]   has never been given to a consumer at all like this.
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:03.040]   Then this year they came out and said, remember that technology we told you about?
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:05.760]   We're using it to make games you can already play with the Wii.
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:07.120]   You just don't have to hold on to anything.
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:08.600]   Here are our mini game collections.
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:09.600]   Yeah.
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:12.920]   They do seem conducive to different styles of gameplay.
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:13.920]   I've played with the move a lot.
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:19.560]   I haven't touched Connect too much, but it seems like the move is more for, like you mentioned,
[00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:23.960]   we like games while I'm sorry, Connect is more for Wii like games while Move is more.
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:26.960]   I don't know, I've seen it played with shooters and it worked really, really well.
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:30.680]   I still like having a button controller in my hand for certain types of gameplay.
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:32.440]   Yeah, Microsoft is a great place to say.
[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:36.640]   There's no, I said, well, could you have a Wii like bat or something?
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:38.880]   No, nothing in your hands.
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:42.800]   Well, the most exciting game that I saw on Connect was not even from Microsoft.
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:47.800]   It was an Ubisoft game called Child of Eden and it's from a designer called Musaguchi.
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:51.800]   You did a game called Rez and this really seems like a successor to that.
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:56.960]   The exciting thing about it is that it was the one game at the show that abstracted the
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:04.040]   control of Connect and just used movement and gesture in your hands to do things that aren't
[00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:05.640]   actually applicable to real life.
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:08.440]   So you're not actually, you're not swinging a tennis racket like you would swing a tennis
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:09.920]   racket, you're not bowling.
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:14.280]   You're doing movements and it's reading your movements to control the game, but it's, you
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:19.920]   know, you clap to release certain weaponry and that to me is much more exciting and a
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:24.280]   much more outside the box kind of application of this technology than anything Microsoft
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:25.280]   was showing.
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:27.120]   Yeah, I'm a huge fan of Rez.
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:30.880]   So, you know, seeing Ubisoft start its press conference with Tetsuya Musaguchi out there,
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:35.200]   you know, conducting an orchestra basically with his hand and playing the game was very
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:36.200]   cool.
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:39.080]   But yeah, it's a very standard type of game.
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:41.080]   I mean, it's basically a rail based shooter.
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:44.840]   So, but instead of, you know, locking onto targets with a controller and hitting them
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:47.840]   all at once, he's just kind of going like this at them.
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:50.520]   So it seems very cool.
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:54.320]   Like I'm very into it, but at the same time, like it's, you know, it's something you could
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:57.120]   totally do with a controller and we'll be able to do it.
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.840]   But at least it's something.
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:03.320]   It's an application of the technology that isn't just a one to one representation of
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:04.920]   things you do in life.
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:10.520]   And I think for me as a, as a more hardcore gamer, I guess, that's much more interesting
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:17.000]   to me to, to think of how we can apply this technology to controlling games in a more outside
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   the box kind of.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.480]   So would it be safe to say that Microsoft's aiming at the casual gamer and family gamer
[00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:29.040]   and social gamer and that Sony is staying true to its core users and aiming after the
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:33.520]   hardcore gamer, the real I really feel like they're both kind of trying to get into that
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:34.520]   Wii market.
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:38.800]   You know, Sony definitely is showing, you know, they're showing so com for, you know,
[00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:43.080]   which is a very, you know, core shooter type of game.
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:46.720]   But also they're showing sports champions, which might as well just be called Wii sports.
[00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.960]   But with a glowy thing on the end of it.
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:50.920]   It's funny, Microsoft had its Wii sports too.
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:51.920]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:53.760]   And they're just called connect sports.
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:55.200]   Like could you get any more?
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.120]   They're not making any of the Wii words.
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:58.760]   Put our word on it and you're done.
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:29:59.760]   Yeah.
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:01.600]   That's what happens when something sells that many copies.
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:02.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:03.600]   Everybody goes, Oh my gosh.
[00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:04.600]   We need more than them.
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:05.600]   Our version.
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:06.600]   That where are we on that?
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:07.600]   Nothing you just mentioned?
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:08.600]   We're on top of that.
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:09.600]   We got it.
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:10.600]   We got it right here.
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:11.600]   And you don't need anything in your hand.
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.240]   Now, what about the glowy globe?
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:15.440]   Is that a good idea for Sony to put that on the move?
[00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:16.440]   That's kind of weird looking.
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.440]   Well, it's, you know, it helps them because--
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:19.440]   Is there a purpose?
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:20.440]   Well, I mean, you have a--
[00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:21.440]   It's for the camera.
[00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:22.440]   Yeah, it's for the camera.
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:23.440]   It's for the camera and also--
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.440]   It's for the one AI camera track the movements on the controller.
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:26.440]   And it can change color.
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:28.440]   You know, it doesn't necessarily have to be a specific color.
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:31.440]   Depending on the game, they can code their own colors for it and stuff.
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:32.440]   Yeah.
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:35.680]   You know, I mean, if you end up looking at pictures of yourself holding one, if you're sensitive
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:37.720]   to glowy orbs, you might think it looks a little silly.
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:38.720]   But it's fine.
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:39.720]   You don't really notice.
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:40.720]   It's kind of cool.
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:41.720]   I don't know.
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:42.720]   I don't mind at all.
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:45.920]   So it sounds like you guys are going to get both move and connect.
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:46.920]   Yes?
[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:47.920]   Yeah, for different reasons.
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:50.880]   If you were a real person, I should say if you were a real person.
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:53.280]   If you were an imaginary 3D avatar.
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:54.280]   Yeah.
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:58.080]   Yeah, I think I would totally end up with both of those things on my own.
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:00.640]   Connect is interesting right now because a lot of that stuff looks first generation.
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:05.320]   There's a lot of talk about it really doesn't like it when people touch each other because
[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:09.040]   the skeletal tracking gets all crazy and then it might not like it if you're sitting down.
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:12.360]   But that just seems like maybe that's where the APIs are at right now and they'll get
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:13.360]   there eventually.
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:16.880]   So it'll be interesting to see what the limitations of that stuff really end up being.
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:21.120]   Is it telling that both Sony and Microsoft are using cameras and Sony doesn't right?
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:23.120]   Sony uses some sort of RF spatial.
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:25.120]   No, they have the camera too.
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:28.600]   There's the camera that they've had on the market for I don't know.
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:29.600]   Yeah.
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:30.960]   So that Wii bar is a camera?
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:33.680]   No, the Wii is infrared.
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:35.680]   It's just sending out light.
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:38.480]   That's why you can use candles instead of that bar if you want to.
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:41.840]   It's just the remote is looking for two lights on it.
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:43.720]   So there's an infrared camera?
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:45.160]   No, not even a camera.
[00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:46.160]   It's just emitting light.
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:47.160]   Well, that's what I was saying.
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:48.160]   I was saying, so Nintendo is not using a camera.
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.840]   Not for Sony or a laptop.
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:55.280]   But Sony and the memory state, Sony and Microsoft decided to use cameras as opposed to the Nintendo
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:56.280]   Wii.
[00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:58.760]   Does that because that's going to be a superior technology?
[00:31:58.760 --> 00:32:02.760]   Well, the camera also for the move at least uses it for motion tracking.
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:06.440]   So it can track your head and the rest of your body as well as tracking the LED light
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:07.520]   on the end of the controller.
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:08.600]   So they have an advantage.
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:12.640]   I mean, one of the things that was cool about Connect is it takes a picture of you acting
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:15.640]   like a dork and then plays it back at the end of the game.
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:19.000]   Yeah, and it ends up being much more precise than it is.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.640]   And it can recognize you.
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:23.240]   So when you get in the game, it says, oh, it's Leo.
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:24.240]   Here's Leo's avatar.
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.240]   I think that's kind of neat.
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:26.920]   Yeah, and I think it's very cool.
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:28.560]   Precision is really key for that stuff.
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:33.280]   That's the big advantage that I think Sony has in this is that just the move controller,
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:38.040]   you feel a lot more in control than you do with a Wii remote, even without Wii Motion
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:39.760]   Plus, it's just really attached to it.
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:40.920]   It feels more directed.
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:44.280]   It feels more accurate, which is what makes it work with shooters and stuff.
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:48.720]   Movement ratio between the movements you make and what you see on the TV is almost completely
[00:32:48.720 --> 00:32:50.360]   instantaneous.
[00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:52.800]   Interesting.
[00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:57.560]   So it sounds like there, even though it is kind of copycat technology, both Sony and
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:01.000]   Microsoft have in some ways advanced over Nintendo.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   Definitely.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   We're to take a break.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.840]   We're talking about the E3 gaming expo, but there's lots more tech news, including
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:14.040]   the iPhone, iOS 4, will arrive on your phones tomorrow, on Monday, and on Thursday, there'll
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:19.800]   be people I have a feeling in line waiting to get an iPhone because Apple had the biggest
[00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:22.720]   pre-sales day it's ever had in history.
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:32.000]   We'll also talk about a Utah attorney general who announced an execution on Twitter.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   Yikes.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   Yikes.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.720]   Before we go to that, though, I do want to talk about our friends at Citrix through
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:40.800]   do the fantastic go-to meeting.
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:44.640]   If you've ever, nowadays, business is a global thing.
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:50.680]   I mean, you have business contacts, partners, clients, colleagues all over the world.
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:53.360]   Business travel is starting to eat up more and more people's budget, but who wants to
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:57.440]   get on that airplane, sit in the middle seat, go through all that inspection silliness,
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:00.160]   and not to mention the stress and the time wasted and the money wasted.
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:01.840]   That's why go-to meeting is so fantastic.
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:05.520]   The next time you're on a conference call, you can start a meeting and you could show
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:08.600]   them the PowerPoint, you could show them the spreadsheets.
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:10.040]   It's just the best way to meet online.
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:13.880]   There are other online meeting solutions, but go-to meeting is simply the fastest, the
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:15.600]   easiest, the best.
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:16.600]   Absolutely secure, too.
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:20.000]   There has never been a remote exploit with go-to meeting.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:21.200]   It is just great.
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:22.840]   SSL 128-bit.
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:25.560]   So you're secure.
[00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:28.960]   You can meet with up to 15 people at the same time and even hand control around.
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:32.160]   So everybody gets a chance to show what's on their screen.
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:33.160]   Very easy to use.
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:37.040]   In fact, if you go right now to go-to meeting.com, you could sign up for a free 30-day trial.
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:39.120]   It's a $49 value.
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:42.840]   As many meetings as you want, as long as you want for the next 30 days.
[00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:43.840]   So go there, do that.
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:45.080]   Before I'm done talking, you'll have it installed.
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:46.440]   It just takes a few seconds.
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:50.680]   Now the next time you're in a meeting, you just tell your client, "Oh, I want to show
[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:51.680]   you this.
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:52.840]   I've got a great presentation for you."
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:54.680]   Go to go-to meeting.com.
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:55.680]   Here's the meeting ID.
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:57.040]   Now they're seeing your computer on their screen.
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.720]   They don't even have to have the software installed.
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:01.080]   It installs in seconds.
[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:02.080]   It's just remarkable.
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:03.080]   We use it all the time.
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:06.840]   In fact, we have multiple accounts now because we have several people using it simultaneously.
[00:35:06.840 --> 00:35:08.800]   And the iPad app for this is incredible too.
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:09.800]   Take a look at that.
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:11.120]   Absolutely free.
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:13.320]   Go to meeting.com/twit.
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:15.520]   Try it free for 30 days.
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:16.520]   We use it.
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:17.520]   I know you will too.
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:18.520]   Go to meeting.com.
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:19.520]   Let's see.
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:22.520]   What other big announcements at E3?
[00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:23.520]   Any big game?
[00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:29.440]   It didn't seem like there were, I mean Capcom versus Marvel.
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:32.040]   You guys know about all this stuff way ahead of time, right?
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:34.360]   Yeah, yeah, for the most part.
[00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:36.880]   And Marvel versus Capcom 3 was definitely there.
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:38.760]   That's a big fan favorite sequel.
[00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:39.760]   Mortal Kombat's best.
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:40.760]   Mortal Kombat.
[00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:41.760]   That's a man.
[00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:44.560]   I could talk about Mortal Kombat for the rest of this show too.
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:45.560]   Please don't.
[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:46.560]   Please.
[00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:48.960]   I've been trying to take over our podcast for like the last week.
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:50.560]   Like, "No, you need to hear about it.
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:51.560]   They're bringing it back.
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:52.560]   It's violent."
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:54.200]   Not only they're bringing it back, they're bringing it back kill shots, right?
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:55.200]   The kill moves.
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:56.200]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:57.200]   The fatalities are back.
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:00.200]   They actually started work on those first this time.
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:02.720]   Normally, that's the last thing they throw in after all the fighting is done.
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:06.560]   This time they're like, because the previous game they did was it had the DC universe
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:07.560]   in it.
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:08.560]   So like Superman and stuff.
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:10.360]   So it was T-rated that couldn't kill Superman.
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:12.240]   So I guess they had to get it out of their system.
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:15.480]   And that's definitely, that's my pick for Game of the Go.
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:17.160]   There seem to be a little bit of nostalgia.
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:20.760]   I think the industry is mature to the point where you're now making games like Mortal
[00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:26.040]   Kombat that appeal to people in their 30s or late 20s youth.
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.040]   They're yout.
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:28.040]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:30.640]   There were a lot of 2D games like Mortal Kombat.
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:31.640]   It was surprising.
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:32.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:33.640]   They're bringing that stuff back.
[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:35.280]   2D platforming is back in a big way.
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:36.280]   That's bizarre.
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:37.280]   That's a...
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:39.120]   Even though 8-bit game is really coming back.
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:40.120]   8-bit, what?
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:41.120]   There were 8-bit games?
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:44.320]   Yeah, like what's up with someone 8-bit heroes?
[00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:45.800]   Donkey Kong Country.
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:47.600]   Yeah, Donkey Kong Country Returns.
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:48.600]   Yeah.
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:49.600]   That's not 8-bit though.
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:51.760]   It's a new Rayman game that looks really spectacular.
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:53.560]   A new Kirby game as well.
[00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:56.480]   Actually, I saw that weird Mickey Mouse game.
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:58.720]   And it looked just like Rayman with Mickey's ears.
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:02.080]   That's only one portion of the game as the side-scrolling kind of black and white stuff.
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:06.480]   But they've also got like a Mario 64, 3D platformer type thing in there too.
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:07.480]   It's kind of interesting.
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:09.120]   Warren Spector is doing a Mickey Mouse game.
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:10.120]   Right.
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:12.440]   And he's so into it when you talk to him.
[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:13.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:14.440]   Huge Disney fans.
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:17.200]   So he's just, you know, they've entrusted the legacy of Mickey Mouse to him.
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:21.120]   So he's going way, way out of his way to make sure they don't screw that up.
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:22.120]   But it looks cool.
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:23.720]   You have paint and you have thinner.
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:27.100]   So a lot of the puzzles are solved by you painting something in or using thinner to
[00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:28.560]   decently try something and moving forward.
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:29.880]   So is it a kid game?
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:32.360]   I think it'll have a wider appeal than that.
[00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:35.440]   It seems like something that could be very kid-friendly.
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:39.000]   But from the looks of it, and of course, Mickey Mouse has that kind of universal appeal.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.040]   I think you'll find it extends just beyond a dark Mickey Mouse.
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:43.560]   It kind of looked kind of interesting.
[00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:44.560]   In spots, yeah.
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:45.560]   For sure.
[00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:46.560]   Did you play it?
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:47.560]   Yeah, I did.
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:48.560]   Yeah.
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:49.560]   I came away a little disappointed, actually.
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:51.520]   I had very high expectations for it.
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:54.880]   And I think design-wise, it's spectacular.
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:38:00.080]   But they found the control to be really unresponsive and-
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:01.080]   But isn't this early?
[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:02.080]   I mean-
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:05.160]   Aren't these showing games like months before they're going to ship these games?
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:07.240]   I mean, how finished are up all the sudden?
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:08.520]   Yeah, I mean, you know, epic Mickey, you'll be out.
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:09.880]   I think this holiday season.
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:12.560]   So they have time to make it more responsive, you think, or not?
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:13.560]   I certainly hope so.
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:14.560]   Yeah.
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:15.560]   Yeah, it's, you know, they're getting close.
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:18.600]   And in some of these games, you end up talking to developers and like, well, we have six
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:22.360]   weeks left to do this stuff before we have to start locking things down and start submitting
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:23.920]   to Nintendo and all this stuff.
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:25.240]   I'll tell you what I was excited about.
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:26.240]   We were lucky.
[00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:28.360]   We got a little footage of Portal 2.
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:29.360]   Yeah.
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:30.360]   Yeah.
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:31.360]   Yeah.
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:32.360]   Doesn't that look awesome?
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:33.360]   It does.
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:34.360]   It hurts my brain just looking at it.
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:35.360]   With a sludge.
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:36.360]   It's been a long time on this one.
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:39.640]   And if looking at the single player stuff hurts your brain, the co-op is going to straight
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:40.640]   up break your mind.
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:43.240]   Like there's some stuff in the co-online co-op or will it be-
[00:38:43.240 --> 00:38:44.240]   Mind explosion.
[00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:46.400]   I believe it'll do both.
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:48.680]   You know, you sound like Glados a little bit Veronica.
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:49.680]   I'm worried.
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:51.400]   It was still a little bit.
[00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:57.040]   The cool thing about Valve is, you know, the kids basically that came up with the idea
[00:38:57.040 --> 00:39:02.760]   for Portal, they acquired them and helped them develop the idea for Portal, the first
[00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:03.760]   Portal.
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:08.400]   And now they have this other group of kids that were in college doing a game called Tag
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.840]   the Power of Paint.
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:12.640]   And they have sort of incorporated that idea into Portal.
[00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:14.400]   Oh, so they've added to the gameplay.
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:15.400]   Yeah.
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:20.120]   And then colored liquids that you can funnel through portals and splash on things.
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:21.120]   I saw that.
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:22.120]   That looked really hard.
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:25.320]   It's like they had to go find new college kids because one of the old ones left.
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:27.120]   That's what Casheweth took off for airtime.
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:28.120]   That's how great is that?
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:35.320]   I mean, they're really culling from just the best ideas rather than trying to just retread
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:36.320]   old ideas.
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:37.320]   It's great.
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:38.320]   But is there cake?
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:39.320]   No, there's no cake.
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:40.320]   It's a lie, Leah.
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.320]   Damn them!
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:42.320]   Damn!
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:43.320]   It's the reverend cake.
[00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:44.320]   No more cake.
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:45.320]   I want cake!
[00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:46.320]   Got to move on.
[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:47.320]   I want cake.
[00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:53.180]   I've actually kind of rediscovered Portal because finally Steam for the Mac came out and got
[00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:54.360]   Portal on it was free.
[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:56.240]   And I've really been at play through it again.
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:57.680]   And it's really is a wonderful game.
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:59.680]   I'm still for Fall Out New Vegas.
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:01.080]   That's what I want to get right now.
[00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:02.080]   Which one?
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:03.080]   Fall Out New Vegas.
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:05.720]   It was a big Bethesda year for me between Rage and Fall Out.
[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:08.720]   You see again nostalgia because you were probably a big Fallout fan when you were a
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:09.720]   teenager.
[00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:10.720]   Yeah.
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:14.200]   So now it's like I just, even though I know it's not going to be that that much different,
[00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:16.840]   I know I'm going to spend a lot of hours playing through it.
[00:40:16.840 --> 00:40:19.600]   Yeah, it's great because they, you know, with the same technology in place, they can
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:24.120]   spend all this time focusing on content and, you know, taking that engine to its limits
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:26.120]   and going as far as they possibly can with it.
[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:27.280]   Which engine is the same engine?
[00:40:27.280 --> 00:40:28.280]   It's the same engine.
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:32.160]   So it's the Fallout 3 engine, you know, they're brushing it up where they can and adding
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:36.200]   some new systems to it to make things like sidekick control a lot easier, which was a
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:38.480]   problem in the previous game.
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:42.440]   But they've just given it off to Obsidian Entertainment, different developers who specialize
[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:46.680]   in this sort of thing and they're going to go off and fill it full of crazy Vegas stuff.
[00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:49.040]   I did a little gambling, did a little shooting at...
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:50.560]   Oh, did you play some of the mini games?
[00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:51.840]   I didn't get a chance to try those.
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:53.040]   Yeah, yeah, I got to see.
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:55.960]   Sometimes you eventually get kicked out of the casino if you win too much money or to
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:57.560]   be cops, I guess I should say.
[00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:58.560]   But yeah.
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:40:59.560]   Cuts, yes.
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:00.560]   Yeah.
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:02.560]   It's a post-nuclear future.
[00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:03.560]   Mm-hmm.
[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:04.560]   You're free.
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:06.840]   Not really in Vegas when the only place is not affected by the Fallout.
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:08.560]   Oh, so it survived.
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:09.560]   I get it.
[00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:10.560]   I get it.
[00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:11.560]   Because it's already a Wasteland.
[00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:12.560]   How could you even tell?
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:13.560]   Yeah.
[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:14.560]   Yeah.
[00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:15.560]   Looks like...
[00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:18.080]   If you're into the Fallout style of gameplay, I think that you have to be excited also about
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:22.600]   the new Deus Ex, which was being shown for the first time at E3.
[00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:27.400]   And it really looks like a combination between sort of Mass Effect and Fallout that...
[00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:31.280]   And you know, the old Deus Ex games where you really have multiple ways to attack a
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:32.280]   situation.
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:37.680]   It's got shooting, it's got a whole dialogue system, it's got that Blade Runner-esque visual.
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:40.520]   It looked really, really impressive.
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:45.120]   You know, I saw On Live playing Deus Ex, and I was pretty impressed.
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:48.200]   I asked him, "Oh, come on, these servers, they're right behind that wall."
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:49.200]   Right?
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:51.040]   And he said, "No, no, these are the Santa Clara servers."
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:55.440]   And of course, On Live is live now on Live Thursday free.
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:57.640]   Has anybody played it in C2?
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:02.280]   I tried signing up for it, but they didn't take American Express and my visa had expired.
[00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:04.680]   So I'm like, "Well, I guess that's that for now."
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:06.760]   I'm still looking forward to trying it.
[00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:10.520]   I've been to people after I posted that on Twitter, got a bunch of responses from people
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:11.520]   that are trying it.
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:14.560]   It seems like a lot of complaints about the video compression that it is very noticeable.
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:15.560]   They're going to have to do something.
[00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:16.560]   I'm going to be worried about it.
[00:42:16.560 --> 00:42:17.560]   Yeah.
[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:21.880]   It seems like it's really the matte client for you.
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:22.880]   Is there a matte client?
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:24.280]   It's a browser plugin.
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:27.600]   So I believe it will run on a Mac right now.
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:28.600]   I don't quote that.
[00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:33.040]   And they were showing their little box, their mini box that you'll be able to buy sometime
[00:42:33.040 --> 00:42:38.320]   in the future so you don't even need a computer to play these high end, maybe not state of
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:41.200]   the art, but high end video games from their servers.
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:42.200]   Right.
[00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:45.440]   And then some of the financial stuff on that seems to be a little, I guess, written into
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:49.480]   the contract as if you let your account lapse for 12 months.
[00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:53.440]   Any games you've purchased on Live are no longer yours.
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:54.440]   That's not good.
[00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:59.120]   So it seems like there's some rights issues with what point do you own the game, don't
[00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:00.120]   own the game?
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:03.040]   You are paying a subscription fee and then buying games on top of that.
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:04.040]   Oh, you are.
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:05.040]   You're buying it.
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:07.040]   Similar to what Sony is doing, right?
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:11.920]   With the plus service where it's you own the game until you're no longer paying the subscription
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:12.920]   fee.
[00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:16.520]   But in those cases, at least those games are free with the subscription.
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:21.520]   It's not like they're making you pay an additional fee on top of that for those that they then
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:22.520]   take away.
[00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:26.320]   This seems a little more potentially devious than that.
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:28.680]   But like I said, I'm still looking forward to trying it for myself.
[00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:32.320]   So I'll withhold too much judgment for now.
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:36.480]   Veronica, it is a Mac or PC, by the way, so you could try it on your Mac.
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:38.280]   It looks like.
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:39.520]   And it does use a lot of bandwidth.
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:42.080]   You'll get less compression if you have more bandwidth, right?
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:46.000]   I mean, they say that you need several megabits a second to have full high def.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   Seems like it.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.040]   It just, you know, this seemed when they announced it a year ago to be hard to believe technology.
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:55.160]   And yet it was working at E3.
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:57.560]   I mean, people were using it and playing games.
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:59.160]   And they didn't seem like a whole lot of lag.
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:03.880]   When I tried it last year, it seemed like there was a noticeable lag on control input,
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:07.000]   like playing something like burnout paradise, like, okay, I'm trying to steer the car.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.960]   And it's not as responsive as it is on the real thing.
[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:12.480]   But I guess it's one of those things where, you know, if you have a net book and you aren't
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:16.600]   necessarily super intense about how you play your video games, this is going to be a way
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:17.600]   for you to do it.
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:18.600]   Yeah, I think it's for.
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:19.600]   It's not for James Kerst.
[00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:20.600]   Yeah.
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:22.920]   You know, it'll be a way for people to experience those games in a way that they wouldn't be able
[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:23.920]   to otherwise.
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:26.400]   So I suppose there is some audience for that.
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:32.640]   And moving forward, I think offloading the processing power needed to play high-end games
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:36.960]   from local to the cloud isn't a really exciting prospect.
[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:39.920]   I think, yeah, this is the first baby step.
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:44.720]   But as we go farther into that idea and that technology advances, I think that is the way
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:45.720]   to go.
[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:49.080]   And it requires less of a financial investment upfront.
[00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:50.680]   And I think that's a win for the consumer.
[00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:53.520]   Unless you're on AT&T and paying for all of your data.
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:54.520]   It's a win.
[00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:55.520]   All right.
[00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:58.480]   So I think AT&T is sponsoring this one year free launch.
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:45:00.480]   But I said, huh, interesting.
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:03.040]   It's a profit deal.
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:06.600]   So but as I said before, the people who really love this, the game manufacturers, they're
[00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:10.840]   moving to more like a music subscription model, right?
[00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:11.840]   Yeah.
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:16.000]   If you buy music on the Zoom marketplace, if you have a Zoom pass and your pass expires,
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.160]   you don't get to keep the music.
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:18.160]   Yeah.
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:21.720]   I think I'd almost prefer something like the old, like the game tap methodology where
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:25.280]   you are actually downloading the games and playing them on your end because you're getting
[00:45:25.280 --> 00:45:26.280]   the bobber experience.
[00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:28.520]   Well, that's what you're not paying for the game.
[00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:29.840]   You're just paying the subscription fee.
[00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:30.840]   I see.
[00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:33.640]   And you're getting access to everything that they support.
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:35.720]   Steam and outs there are going to be on the PS3.
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:37.040]   What is the story on that?
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:40.640]   They're bringing Steamworks to the PS3 and some of the Steam cloud stuff.
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:44.640]   So some of the backend elements of Steam that developers use are going to come to the PlayStation
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:46.280]   3 and that's kind of key for Valve.
[00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:49.720]   I mean, it might not matter for something like talking to them.
[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:52.600]   They say it might not matter for something like Portal 2.
[00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:56.120]   But if you look at something like Team Fortress 2 where they're constantly updating it and
[00:45:56.120 --> 00:46:00.200]   rolling out all these patches, I mean, the certification process on consoles is a pain.
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:03.000]   There's a ton of limitations that come along with it.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:08.040]   If they can sidestep that stuff and allow some other developers to have more direct control
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:13.280]   over their games by updating through Steamworks, I think that just opens up the door for people
[00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:14.440]   to do some cooler stuff.
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:19.960]   I mean, Xbox 360 users and PS3 users, if the game had come out there, wouldn't be able
[00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:23.800]   to enjoy all of the Team Fortress 2 updates that Valve has been pushing out for the past
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:26.080]   year or however long.
[00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:30.480]   And this kind of gives them a pathway to do something similar to that for games on the
[00:46:30.480 --> 00:46:31.480]   PS3.
[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:35.920]   Veronica, there's a vote in the chat room for you to go to the Valve headquarters and meet
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:36.920]   those guys.
[00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:37.920]   I would love to.
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:38.920]   Would that be fun?
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:39.920]   Try to set something up.
[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:40.920]   Yep.
[00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:41.920]   On core.
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:42.920]   Halo reached.
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:46.360]   I mean, get a chance to play with that at all or just look at the cutscenes.
[00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:47.360]   Yeah.
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:48.360]   Played a little bit of that.
[00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:52.440]   And a new multiplayer mode, actually, it's expanded multiplayer mode from what was in
[00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:53.440]   ODST.
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:57.440]   They're bringing back firefight, which is sort of a four players against, you know,
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:47:00.560]   never-ending waves of enemies style of mode.
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:03.200]   And the problem they had with the last game is you had to play with friends.
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:05.840]   There was no means to say, "Hey, I want to play this.
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:07.920]   Find me some folks and get your matchmaking on."
[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:10.720]   So they're adding that as well as a lot of other options.
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:12.760]   And of course, it takes place in the world of each.
[00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:15.480]   So you get these kind of armor abilities and other stuff that haven't been in previous
[00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:16.480]   Halo games.
[00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:20.560]   It seems like an important step for that style of play.
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:23.400]   But they weren't really showing off a ton of single player stuff, which is what I was
[00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:27.120]   hoping to get out of the show is a better look at the campaign.
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:30.640]   I wanted to see modern warfare black ops, but I went in there.
[00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:31.640]   There was nobody at the booth.
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:32.640]   I guess they'd all been fired.
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:33.640]   I don't know what happened.
[00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:34.640]   That's just a joke.
[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:35.640]   I'm just making a joke.
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:36.640]   I did play that.
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:37.640]   Did you play it?
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:38.640]   Yeah.
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:39.640]   I flew that helicopter.
[00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:40.640]   I blew up those bridges.
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:42.840]   It's the explosions looked terrific.
[00:47:42.840 --> 00:47:47.080]   And Treyarch's doing some good stuff with the old Infinity War technology.
[00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:51.080]   I think that game will be-- let's say it'll be another year before Activision has to figure
[00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:53.680]   out what they're actually going to do with that franchise.
[00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:54.680]   They've got this year lockdown.
[00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:56.480]   Is it basically an expansion?
[00:47:56.480 --> 00:47:57.480]   Yeah.
[00:47:57.480 --> 00:48:01.760]   It's the-- sort of like with World of War, the last game that Treyarch did, they're taking
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:06.640]   the previous year's engine and kind of pimping it out where they can and going very content
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:07.640]   heavy.
[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:11.440]   So this one's all Cold War era black ops into Laos and stuff like that.
[00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:12.440]   So you definitely--
[00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:17.800]   One of the big stories of the show is the rush to be the next Call of Duty is all these
[00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:23.400]   companies putting out their military themed shooter and their version of the thing that's
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:24.400]   sold.
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:26.720]   Well, Jeff, what's your candidate?
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:29.040]   What's your best kind of Gears of War III or--
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:32.680]   Well, I love Gears, but I think the game that was the biggest surprise in that particular
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:34.400]   genre was a game called Home Front.
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:36.240]   Oh, that looks so cool.
[00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:37.240]   Yeah.
[00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:38.240]   Tell us about that.
[00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:41.640]   It's basically the idea of what if.
[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:42.640]   It's a big what if game.
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:47.000]   It's what if North Korea invaded the United States.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.800]   And the way they introduced the game was very cool.
[00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:54.800]   They had real, real footage, news footage of like Hillary Clinton making a speech.
[00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:59.720]   And so really grounding it in a tomorrow-- what-- it could happen tomorrow or the day after
[00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:00.720]   tomorrow.
[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:04.560]   And the whole tone of the game seems very un-video game-like.
[00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:08.440]   It seems much more serious and somber.
[00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:13.240]   And John Millius, the filmmaker who did Red Dawn and a whole bunch of other movies, is
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:14.760]   involved in making it.
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:16.720]   That was the plot of Red Dawn kind of.
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:17.720]   Yeah, basically.
[00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:18.720]   Exactly.
[00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:25.200]   And it's really exciting to me that we're seeing video games get a little bit more mature,
[00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:32.080]   not just in violent or sexual content, but in a way they're communicating their stories.
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:33.080]   Yeah.
[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:39.360]   And really the demo that they showed was very affecting and had some awesome action sequences,
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:42.360]   but in a context of real emotion.
[00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:44.160]   And it was very powerful.
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:45.160]   It was very--
[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:46.200]   I'd love to see more story.
[00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:49.080]   I mean, you can only go so far with shoot 'em ups.
[00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:51.240]   And I mean, yeah, World War II was a story.
[00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:54.240]   But let's-- something like this is very innovative, very interesting.
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:55.240]   Yeah, for sure.
[00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:58.360]   It's just hard to compete with that multiplayer focus that everyone wants.
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:01.000]   That's the thing that keeps people from selling the games back used.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:07.120]   So the business side tells you to not focus on the six-hour storyline and instead--
[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:08.120]   Of course.
[00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:09.120]   --more maps.
[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:12.440]   Yeah, I'm not a huge multiplayer person, but I do like playing shooters.
[00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:15.640]   And I like them to have a pretty rich storyline because it really draws you in.
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:16.640]   Yeah.
[00:50:16.640 --> 00:50:19.800]   And I think a lot of developers now are focusing a lot more on storyline than they have in
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:24.440]   the past, especially with games like Uncharted 2 being so storyline focused and things like
[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:25.520]   heavy rain.
[00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:29.880]   Even the shooters are starting to pick up on that like on Killzone 3, for example.
[00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:34.400]   I loved Bioshock just because it was a really interesting story or two.
[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:35.400]   It was just so much atmosphere to it.
[00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:36.400]   I love the atmosphere.
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:37.400]   You know, and it was a pretty tame shooter.
[00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:38.400]   Fresh buy sucks, amazing.
[00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:41.440]   Yeah, but at the same time, I didn't care it was a tame shooter.
[00:50:41.440 --> 00:50:42.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:44.680]   Because I was engrossed in-- what am I going to see around the next corner?
[00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:46.160]   Yeah, walk through the whole game with a wrench.
[00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:48.160]   Didn't matter as long as you have to see what was actually happening.
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:49.160]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:51.160]   And Homefront looks like it's like a game called X-Com.
[00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:52.160]   Yeah.
[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:53.160]   X-Com looks pretty cool.
[00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:54.160]   Yeah, they're bringing X-Com back.
[00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:58.000]   X-Com is an old turn-based strategy game that they're remaking into a first-person shooter.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:03.160]   They're like the Fallout 3 situation where they're angering a lot of old fans.
[00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:07.440]   But having seen the new X-Com, you know, it looks like a Fallout 3 situation where you
[00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:12.160]   are going to close your book of angry things you've said about Fallout 3 and instead go,
[00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:13.160]   "This game looks awesome.
[00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:14.160]   I would love to see more."
[00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:18.880]   It's like 1950s America, so it's a lot of great suits and a lot of great environments
[00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:23.240]   and, you know, kind of idyllic suburban America yet infested with aliens and you're going
[00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:28.400]   out into these kind of generated missions and saving humanity kind of one level at a time.
[00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:32.120]   I have a question for you guys and I really did not know what to expect when I came to
[00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:33.280]   E3.
[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:39.360]   But I had thought that the really hot category in gaming, maybe you're going to mock me here,
[00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:42.640]   is this casual gaming and particularly Farmville and virtual goods games.
[00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:44.640]   And I really expected to see more apps.
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:49.520]   I expected, you know, more iPhone games, more iPad games, maybe more Android games and
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:52.960]   more Facebook style Farmville style games.
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:54.760]   Is this just not the show for that kind of thing?
[00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:55.760]   I think that's the case.
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:56.760]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:59.200]   Like those people are talking directly to their customer at this point.
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:00.960]   They don't need to go to the dealers.
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:04.960]   Yeah, they're going right to getting their missus job directly on Facebook.
[00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:05.960]   Yeah, okay.
[00:52:05.960 --> 00:52:08.720]   Because that really is the hot category I think right now.
[00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:11.680]   These guys are making hundreds of millions of dollars with a trivial game.
[00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:15.080]   Yeah, and it's, you know, it's the same situation that mobile games are in to some extent where
[00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:20.080]   it's like, you know, the price is so minimal that, you know, reviewing games like that
[00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:23.080]   are not necessarily people aren't looking for.
[00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:24.080]   It's the in game.
[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:25.080]   Totally.
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:26.080]   Totally.
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:28.720]   The one that's making for reviews of single games or anything.
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:32.440]   There are a lot more free to play games this year than I've ever seen.
[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:37.160]   And I think that's a big growth area where, you know, even a company of heroes showing
[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:38.680]   a free to play version.
[00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:39.680]   How does that work?
[00:52:39.680 --> 00:52:43.400]   Very popular real time strategy game where it's, you know, you can download the client,
[00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:47.920]   you can play the game and you can play pretty much all of the game.
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:53.680]   But if you want to advance in the game faster than just putting in the hours to advance,
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:57.640]   you want to sort of skip to the head of the line, so to speak, you can pay a little money
[00:52:57.640 --> 00:53:01.920]   and they'll let you get the thing that you would need to put in hours to get.
[00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:05.760]   Well, it was inevitable that the gaming companies would not want to give up money to the gold
[00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:06.840]   farmers anymore.
[00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:08.840]   So they do the gold farming for you, right?
[00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:09.840]   Yeah.
[00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:15.080]   And I think cheat codes in their games on Xbox for a while now you go unlock, you know, 110%
[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:21.600]   rated golfers in Tiger Woods and such and unlock cars in need for speed for nominal fees.
[00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:25.680]   If you, which doesn't make any sense to me, you know, last time I checked, people bought
[00:53:25.680 --> 00:53:27.080]   games to actually play them.
[00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:31.440]   So it always seemed a little crazy to me when EA did that thing.
[00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:35.280]   But company of yours online seems like a good use of that stuff where, you know, you can
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:36.280]   just put in the time.
[00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:40.600]   And like Jeff said, you know, if you want to just buy your way past all of the grinding
[00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:44.360]   and get to the end of it, you can, you can totally do all that.
[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:45.800]   Yeah, I'm sick of grinding.
[00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:47.760]   That's one of the reasons I don't run.
[00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:49.920]   I can't play World of Warcraft that much anymore.
[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:52.640]   It just seemed like it was a lot of grinding and I was just tired.
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:53.920]   You got to work for it.
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:54.920]   I don't want to run.
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:55.920]   Running Sim.
[00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:56.920]   Run, run, run, running.
[00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:57.920]   Gaming is hard work, Leo.
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:53:58.920]   Oh man, I'm lazy.
[00:53:58.920 --> 00:53:59.920]   You got to put in the hours.
[00:53:59.920 --> 00:54:00.920]   If I could find a suite.
[00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:02.320]   I haven't played Warcraft in three months.
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:03.960]   So I can't really have it.
[00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:04.960]   I'm on a bit of a break.
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:05.960]   I'm waiting for cataclysm.
[00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:08.120]   Cataclysm will call you back.
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:09.120]   What's cataclysm?
[00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:10.120]   Is Blizzard also?
[00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:12.600]   It's the next expansion for World of Warcraft.
[00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:16.840]   They don't really have a presence at E3 because they have Blizzcon for a year.
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:17.840]   They don't really need to.
[00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:18.840]   Yeah, bigger than E3.
[00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:19.840]   Yeah, they don't need E3.
[00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:21.640]   They don't need the press again.
[00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:24.960]   It's another situation where they're big enough where they put out their own DANG magazine.
[00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:28.200]   Like here, just get World of Warcraft magazine and come to Blizzard.com if you want info
[00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:29.200]   on our stuff.
[00:54:29.200 --> 00:54:30.200]   All right, see ya.
[00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:31.720]   Well, isn't that the position you'd like to be in?
[00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:32.720]   Absolutely.
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:35.560]   And you know, as someone who covers this stuff, I think it'd be great if more companies were
[00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:39.840]   in that position because it sets us up as more of the kingdom honest.
[00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:40.840]   Yeah.
[00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:45.280]   Instead of working with them to get exclusive previews and all this kind of weird, slightly
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:46.280]   shame stuff.
[00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:47.880]   It is compromising a little bit, isn't it?
[00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:52.440]   Because when you're covering something so specific, you have to have the sources.
[00:54:52.440 --> 00:54:54.920]   You have to stay in good graces with them.
[00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:59.080]   So you've gotten a little bit of trouble yourself, Jeff, for panning a game.
[00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:01.880]   Well, I can't legally talk about that, I guess.
[00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:03.880]   But I'm just pointing that out.
[00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:08.040]   Well, and by the way, you have huge respect from, you know, when I tell people Jeff Gersman
[00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:09.720]   is going to be on, people love you.
[00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:14.280]   And one of the reasons you have such respect is because unlike a lot of journalists who
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:18.480]   covered the gaming industry, you were willing to say a game was crap.
[00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:23.680]   And you know, there are a fair amount of games that are crap out there.
[00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:24.680]   A fair amount.
[00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:29.240]   Or, you know, or at least you have middling or fair, let's say.
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:34.120]   And, you know, it's when you're speaking to an audience of people that live for this
[00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:35.440]   stuff, you know, they know.
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:36.440]   They know.
[00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:37.440]   That's really true, don't they?
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:38.440]   You know?
[00:55:38.440 --> 00:55:41.840]   And the minute you say, "Oh, this game, I love this game," and it's not a good game,
[00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:42.840]   you've lost it.
[00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:43.840]   I mean, they know.
[00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:44.840]   Yeah.
[00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:46.840]   You know, when you make, you know, it takes years to build up any kind of credibility.
[00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:49.960]   And as soon as you make one mistake in a review, like how many people are just like,
[00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:50.960]   "Well, that guy doesn't know what he's talking about.
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:51.960]   I'm going to read this again."
[00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:52.960]   Yeah.
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:55.320]   All right, we're going to wrap up our E3 coverage.
[00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:56.880]   I'll give all of you a last chance.
[00:55:56.880 --> 00:56:00.480]   What was your favorite thing, Jeff Gerstman of the E3 this year?
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:01.920]   I'm just going to say Mortal Kombat.
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:05.080]   Dude, it's got all these characters from the first three games.
[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:09.400]   It's like all the times I spent not going to high school to hang out at the Pizza Hut
[00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:11.040]   to play MK.
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:13.040]   It's got a lot of that stuff back into it again.
[00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:17.520]   But also, XCOM, Rock Band 3, DJ Hero 2, I feel like, you know, there are still some--
[00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:18.920]   Oh, we didn't mention Rock Band 3.
[00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:20.720]   Yeah, Rock Band 3 is a huge deal.
[00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:21.720]   Yeah, Rock Band 3 is a game.
[00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:22.720]   I am terrible at the game.
[00:56:22.720 --> 00:56:27.720]   It is the bridge between playing a game and actually doing something in real life.
[00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:31.080]   Well, this is my complaint always about Rock Band and guitar heroes.
[00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:34.360]   You're learning not to play an instrument but to fake an instrument.
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:35.840]   But now this is a real instrument.
[00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:36.840]   Yeah, they've got a real fan of guitar.
[00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:40.920]   I think Sromo is really going to push this into the next level because, I mean, if kids
[00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:44.800]   get excited about playing instruments in video game terms, if they actually start playing
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:51.440]   instruments, it can really change the way that educators handle musical lessons and
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:52.440]   that kind of thing.
[00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:56.360]   Especially when Dance Dance Revolution got really popular, remember, and everyone's like,
[00:56:56.360 --> 00:56:57.960]   "We should put DDR kids in gyms."
[00:56:57.960 --> 00:57:00.280]   So kids actually get some exercise in school.
[00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:04.120]   I think it's going to get a lot more people interested in playing music for real.
[00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:05.120]   So tell me--
[00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:06.120]   It's a huge paradigm shift.
[00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:12.480]   Tell me-- I think it's a much bigger deal than it even seems because I think gaming and
[00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:20.320]   the idea of play pushing you into getting a real world skill is extraordinary.
[00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:23.840]   And the fact that there's going to be all these kids out there, you can literally plug
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:28.720]   a fender guitar into an amp and into the game, play the song.
[00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:29.720]   What, really?
[00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:30.720]   Yeah.
[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:31.720]   It's a meeting guitar.
[00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:32.720]   It's a meeting keyboard.
[00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:33.720]   Yeah.
[00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:35.120]   Wow, that's really awesome.
[00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:36.760]   And they're not the only ones doing this.
[00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:40.560]   There's another game in the works that's going to offer real guitars, but they are the
[00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:44.880]   ones that have this huge music library and all these ties to artists and stuff where
[00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:48.600]   they're going to be in the position to best exploit this stuff.
[00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:49.600]   So did you guys play with them?
[00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:50.600]   And how does it work?
[00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:54.800]   Does it-- OK, if you're playing a real instrument, is it only looking at the rhythm?
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:55.800]   Is it looking at your notes?
[00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:56.800]   No, it's looking at the notes.
[00:57:56.800 --> 00:58:02.280]   It's looking at the sensor between the two fret boards so it knows exactly which fret
[00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:06.120]   you're depressing and which string you're strumming.
[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:12.560]   So it can literally tell with precision that you are playing the correct notes.
[00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:17.640]   And the game communicates which notes, which frets you need to play in a very elegant way
[00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:22.840]   for people who are new to the guitar and people who play guitar normally.
[00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:25.000]   Could you actually learn an instrument this way?
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:26.000]   Well, yeah, I think so.
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:27.000]   I think so, yeah.
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.000]   It's actually teaching you how to play the instrument.
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.000]   I mean, Rockman 2 basically taught me how to play the drums.
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.680]   I mean, all I really needed was a little more rhythm.
[00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:36.680]   Do you be able to do three things at once, both hands and a foot instead of just two things
[00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:37.680]   at once?
[00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:40.320]   So that to me is very exciting because now kids instead of just kind of throwing all
[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:42.200]   these many hours down the tubes are actually--
[00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:43.200]   Right.
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:44.680]   They're going to learn a skill that's going to--
[00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:47.600]   Yeah, and the neat thing, they're building in all kinds of crazy training stuff.
[00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:49.000]   And there are difficulty settings.
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:53.520]   So when you play it on expert, you are literally playing the song towards everything.
[00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:57.520]   But you can scale it back and play it on easy and work your way up to that point.
[00:58:57.520 --> 00:59:01.960]   It's good that they're not expecting everyone just to be able to pick up their MIDI acts
[00:59:01.960 --> 00:59:03.120]   and dive right in.
[00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:06.760]   Yeah, I think that's a very important point because it can be misleading, especially
[00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:10.160]   somebody that's played Rockman before, because Rockman has the progression from easy to
[00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:11.160]   expert.
[00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:15.320]   But then there's an entirely different progression on the pro mode from easy to expert.
[00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:19.240]   So now you're playing pro and you really do have to press the right fret and strum the
[00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:21.200]   right string.
[00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:25.920]   But you can start slow and move up to expert in that progression as well.
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:26.920]   So you can really--
[00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:31.680]   I tried the keyboard on medium for the first time and I did really poorly.
[00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:32.680]   Do you play keyboards?
[00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:34.160]   And I said, I don't know.
[00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:37.920]   And I thought, oh, well, I think when I picked up the guitar for the first time, I kind of
[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:41.960]   caught with it very quickly in rock band two or original rock band.
[00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:45.400]   But the keyboards are a lot harder to start out with the first time.
[00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:47.680]   Yeah, and they've got settings for that.
[00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:49.560]   They've got a regular and a pro mode for keyboard.
[00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:51.280]   So you're playing on a regular.
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:54.680]   It's just five buttons like it would be on any of the old rock band guitars.
[00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:57.080]   And then from there, if you want to play actual chords and all that stuff, they can--
[00:59:57.080 --> 01:00:01.680]   So do you have to have a rock band instrument or can you take an existing instrument?
[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:02.680]   So it's MIDI.
[01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:03.960]   They have a MIDI inbox.
[01:00:03.960 --> 01:00:08.080]   So if you have a MIDI keyboard already, you can just plug-- you can buy this MIDI inbox
[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:09.480]   instead of their keyboard.
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:11.920]   I think that's all I need for the keyboard and drums though, right?
[01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:14.240]   The guitar needs to be the peripheral that they created.
[01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:15.800]   They have, I saw, a Fender guitar.
[01:00:15.800 --> 01:00:18.240]   Well, yeah, they teamed with the Fender to make one.
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:24.040]   And they also have a pro style controller that has, I think, 109 buttons on it.
[01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:25.040]   Yeah.
[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:29.240]   So it is just buttons, but you can't just plug in any MIDI guitar.
[01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:33.320]   My understanding that it does connect via-- like, the Fender guitar is a MIDI connection.
[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:35.080]   There is definitely a MIDI port on it.
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:36.160]   Right, but it doesn't--
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:40.840]   A regular guitar doesn't have the sensor pickup required to communicate to the game.
[01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:42.400]   It needs to know what stringing--
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:43.400]   Exactly.
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:44.400]   Yeah.
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:45.880]   And they haven't given a price on that.
[01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:47.960]   But I think-- I mean, guitars are expensive.
[01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:53.520]   So if you're going to buy $250 real guitar, it works as a real guitar and as a controller
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:54.520]   for the game.
[01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:57.160]   So the keyboard, the keyboard peripheral can also be used as a regular keyboard.
[01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:58.160]   It has that MIDI out.
[01:00:58.160 --> 01:01:02.520]   So you don't need to have a special keyboard or a keyboard already at home in order to play.
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:06.880]   You can buy this one and then also use this keyboard to make real music on your computer
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:07.880]   if you want to as well.
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:11.440]   And they refuse to call it one, but that keyboard is basically a keytar.
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:12.440]   You see the little--
[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:13.440]   It's got an off-brand guitar.
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:15.120]   It has room for a strap on it.
[01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:17.120]   You can totally pick it up and play it like a keytar.
[01:01:17.120 --> 01:01:20.480]   And you can also find like the old rock band games.
[01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:23.960]   The guitar sections of the old rock band games using the keytar.
[01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:24.960]   Yeah.
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:25.960]   So how cool is that?
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:26.960]   Very exciting.
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:29.640]   So they show you a keyboard, a section of the keyboard and you actually have to hit
[01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:31.400]   the proper keys at the proper time.
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:33.000]   You're playing the freaking song.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   Yeah.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.280]   It's like the old Miracle keyboard tutor back for the Super Nintendo and PC in the early
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:39.440]   90s.
[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:40.440]   But fun.
[01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:41.840]   Now I just want-- I want Billy Joel.
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:43.120]   I want Elton John.
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:44.400]   And I want Ben Folds.
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:45.400]   Yeah.
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:47.680]   They've got Bohemian Rhapsody in there now.
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:48.680]   The doors one looks good.
[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:49.680]   Yeah.
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:50.680]   I want to play that.
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:51.680]   More Hendrix.
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:52.680]   Yeah.
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:53.680]   I can't wait to play Bohemian Rhapsody.
[01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:54.680]   That's going to be my new favorite.
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:55.680]   It's all vocals.
[01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:56.680]   Yeah.
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:57.680]   And the harmonies.
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:58.680]   Yeah.
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:01:59.680]   The harmonies from Beatles now.
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:03.680]   So you can have three singers at once.
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:04.680]   Yeah.
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:05.680]   Really cool.
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:08.200]   So you can really see a little silhouette of a man.
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:09.360]   It's got a moosh.
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:11.320]   It's got a moosh.
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:12.680]   So Jeff was a rock band.
[01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:14.040]   Your pick of the show.
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:15.040]   What did you like?
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:16.040]   It's certainly up there.
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:19.880]   But I think that if I had to choose one game as my game of show it would be Civilization
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:20.880]   5.
[01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:21.880]   Oh, God.
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:25.600]   Civilization 5 is just pure amazing.
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:30.360]   And it could be one game that I could play for probably three years without ever getting
[01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:32.680]   to the bottom of the depth of that game.
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:33.680]   And it's hexes now.
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:37.760]   It's how huge that they've moved to hexes for the grid now.
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:38.760]   Yes.
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:39.760]   Exactly.
[01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:40.760]   The game.
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:42.760]   You guys are such, such way.
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:45.320]   I can't even believe you're excited about that.
[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:46.320]   Hexes.
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:47.680]   I should have brought my notebook.
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:51.040]   I actually have hexes written huge underline like five times.
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:52.040]   Oh, my God.
[01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:53.040]   Hexes.
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:54.040]   So it's still.
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:55.040]   You know like Settlers of Gataan.
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:56.720]   It's yeah, I do like that game actually.
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:58.680]   Sometimes I can't ever get my family to play that with me.
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:00.680]   Would you come over Veronica and play Settlers of Gataan?
[01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:01.680]   Oh, totally.
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:02.680]   Absolutely.
[01:03:02.680 --> 01:03:03.680]   You're killing me.
[01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:05.680]   I love Settlers, Puerto Rico, Agricola.
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:07.560]   Oh, you know, okay.
[01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:09.640]   Next to it, you're all coming to the cottage.
[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:11.760]   And instead of actually doing to it, we're going to play Settlers of Gataan.
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:14.000]   Do I have the game of the Roan's card game?
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000]   Ooh.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.960]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:19.400]   Is it like magic, the gathering or is it?
[01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:21.360]   No, no, not quite.
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:22.360]   I'll show it to you.
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:23.360]   It's very complicated.
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:25.840]   It took me, Tom and Roger like two hours to figure out the rules.
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:26.840]   Oh, good.
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:27.840]   I play those for Lannisters.
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:28.840]   Oh, yeah.
[01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:29.840]   Yeah, you would.
[01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:30.840]   You would.
[01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:31.840]   You would.
[01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:34.440]   He's a Jamie Lannister, isn't he?
[01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:35.440]   Ew.
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:36.440]   Okay.
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:38.800]   God, how do we get into that?
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:39.800]   What was your?
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:41.800]   So your pick is Civ 5, Jeff and I.
[01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:44.320]   Civ 5, they've streamlined the interface.
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:47.520]   The graphics have had a huge leap forward.
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:48.520]   And hexes.
[01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:49.520]   And hexes.
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:51.360]   You can't beat hexes.
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:53.520]   And I mean, there's so many little subtle changes.
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:58.400]   You can't have more than one army type on a square or on a hex at a time, which completely
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.760]   changes the way battles play out.
[01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:02.240]   It's so, so great.
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:05.440]   I mean, these guys are very smart and the game looks spectacular.
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:07.840]   Every time I play Civ, it's still turn based, right?
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:08.840]   Yeah.
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:09.840]   It's so bored.
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:10.840]   I don't want to do.
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:12.240]   You just got to learn how to go really fast.
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:13.240]   I see.
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:17.520]   I like the age of empires a lot because I like, but I don't like the turn based stuff as
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:18.520]   much.
[01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:20.680]   Yeah, it's a time of a lot of that.
[01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:21.680]   Yeah.
[01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:22.680]   All right.
[01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:23.680]   I'll give it a try.
[01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:25.560]   When it comes out, Civ 5, how about you Veronica Belmont?
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:26.960]   What was your pick of the show?
[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:30.640]   I'm probably going to have to say, as I mentioned, fall out New Vegas because I'm a
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:34.440]   huge fall out fan and I can't wait to get back into that world.
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:36.080]   But I also really liked Rock Band 3.
[01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:40.280]   I've kind of had some time off from Rock Band 2 and I'm excited to have some new difficulties
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:44.440]   and some new modes and they've made a lot of changes to career mode to and being able
[01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:45.440]   to share set lists.
[01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:49.000]   And I think it's going to be really fun.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.840]   You're making me excited about games again.
[01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:51.840]   Isn't that great?
[01:04:51.840 --> 01:04:52.840]   Yeah.
[01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:54.520]   You know, it's a new hardware and new software.
[01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:56.640]   It's like everything's been refreshed all over again.
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:57.640]   That's E3.
[01:04:57.640 --> 01:04:59.640]   I felt like, oh, I want to go home and play a game now.
[01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:01.240]   I mean, it was really, it really did feel that.
[01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:04.640]   Yeah, I went home and dug right into the like the crackdown to demo that's going to be
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:05.640]   available on Monday.
[01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:06.640]   Like, love crack.
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:07.960]   Get home and play some more games.
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:10.760]   I love that stuff, baby.
[01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:12.960]   PlayStation 3, Xbox or Wii.
[01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:14.200]   What are you, Jeff Gursman?
[01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:16.160]   You know, at this point, it doesn't really matter.
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:17.720]   It's all three.
[01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:18.720]   That's my answer.
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:19.720]   Yeah.
[01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:20.720]   I mean, you have to own, you know, all three.
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:21.720]   You have to own everything.
[01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:22.720]   You have to own them all.
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:24.680]   It's like Jeff Kinotic, Xbox, PlayStation 3.
[01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:25.680]   What are you?
[01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:30.520]   I tell you, I came out of this E3 more excited about the Wii than I have been ever.
[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:31.520]   That's pathetic.
[01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:32.520]   That's what she said.
[01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:33.520]   What?
[01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:34.520]   Nice.
[01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:35.520]   Sorry.
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:36.520]   I'm sorry.
[01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:37.520]   But yes, all three consoles.
[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:41.960]   I mean, I'm sort of agnostic when it comes to the console war.
[01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:45.760]   There's great stuff to play on all of them and I would never want to give up any of them.
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:50.320]   I'm still, I have a Wii and I just lost interest after five minutes.
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:54.920]   They're in a weird spot, you know, that's they're bringing back these kind of old franchises
[01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:58.360]   to kind of appease the people that grew up with Nintendo and they're kind of going
[01:05:58.360 --> 01:05:59.360]   from there.
[01:05:59.360 --> 01:06:00.360]   Yeah, I was not an Nintendo guy.
[01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:02.640]   I was a Atari, then a Sega.
[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:04.000]   I skipped the Nintendo thing.
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.000]   Maybe that's why.
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.000]   All right.
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.000]   We're going to take a break.
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.240]   Come back with some actual other stuff, tech news.
[01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:12.000]   There's a little bit before we go though.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.360]   I do want to plug our friends at audible audible.com.
[01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:22.080]   In fact, if you go to audible.com/twit2 right now, you get two free audio books.
[01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:27.240]   Audible is the place to go for audio books.
[01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:30.280]   If you haven't yet experienced the audible effect, you must go.
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:35.360]   Anybody who spends any time in the car, at the gym, you know, in the garden, anytime
[01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:38.480]   you can't hold a book, but you want to get some reading done, audible is great.
[01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:43.120]   The new David Kirkpatrick book is finally out.
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:44.120]   Just came out last week.
[01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:47.080]   The Facebook effect, the inside story of the company that's connecting the world.
[01:06:47.080 --> 01:06:49.000]   This has been hotly awaited.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.240]   There's actually two Facebook books on audible.
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:53.240]   You probably should read both.
[01:06:53.240 --> 01:07:02.520]   I loved accidental billionaires, but it's kind of more like the kitty Kelly version of the
[01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:03.680]   Facebook story.
[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:04.840]   This is by Ben Mesrich.
[01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:08.320]   This is the one the movie is going to be based on.
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:09.560]   There's two audible books for you.
[01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:12.720]   I noticed the Alan First spies of the Balkans is out.
[01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:16.360]   If you've never read an Alan First novel, his stuff is fantastic.
[01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:21.640]   And if there's anybody that didn't get the references we just made to a Game of Thrones,
[01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:22.640]   you're right.
[01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:24.000]   That's not that audible.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.960]   That'll keep you busy for the rest of your life.
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:29.320]   Stop what you're doing and do that immediately.
[01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:31.080]   They're amazing on Audible.
[01:07:31.080 --> 01:07:32.080]   Amazing.
[01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:34.920]   Yeah, and I wish Roy Dottrice was still reading them because I guess he doesn't read the most
[01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:35.920]   recent ones.
[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:36.920]   So good.
[01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:37.920]   He let me play a little bit.
[01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:42.160]   Just so you get an idea of what it is like to listen to an audible book.
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:47.800]   This is Roy Dottrice reading Game of Thrones, the song of Ice and Fire book one, which is
[01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:50.120]   going to be an HBO miniseries soon.
[01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:54.120]   Sable, thick, and black and soft as in.
[01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:56.320]   That he killed them all himself he did.
[01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:58.760]   Garrett told the barracks over wine.
[01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:00.280]   Trish hidden and heads off.
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:01.280]   He's so good.
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:02.560]   Jamie Lannister is fantastic.
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:03.920]   It's just a wonderful book.
[01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:05.280]   Yeah, that's a great one.
[01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:06.280]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:07.280]   Absolutely right.
[01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:10.360]   And 33 hours, 26 minutes just for the first book.
[01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:14.240]   If you get two of them, because you're going to get too free at audible.com/twit2, you're
[01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:19.200]   basically saying I'm committing the rest of the year to George RR Martin.
[01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:22.800]   And I can't imagine anything better to do.
[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:23.800]   So there's how many of these?
[01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:24.800]   There's four now.
[01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:25.800]   Yeah.
[01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:26.800]   With a fifth come.
[01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:27.800]   Someday.
[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:29.760]   We're hoping the fifth will be coming soon.
[01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:30.760]   He's writing them now.
[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:31.760]   We hear.
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:34.520]   I'm going to tell you a lot about the stuff he's writing.
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:36.440]   So I hope he's writing also.
[01:08:36.440 --> 01:08:38.160]   Better than Lord of the Rings because better.
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:40.200]   Yeah, I think it's actually better.
[01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:41.200]   I do too.
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:45.080]   And there's never been a more patient writer as far as setting things up and paying them
[01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:50.880]   off much, much later that the world is spectacular and fully realized.
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:51.880]   It's great, great, great.
[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:53.880]   I can see what you can definitely call him patient.
[01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:56.880]   Exactly what he is.
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:09:01.360]   Mind numbing leap patience.
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:05.600]   Oh, that's just because you feel like you have to go through these because of Sword
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:08.200]   and Laser, you got to get the next book, the next book, the next book.
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:09.200]   It's true.
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:10.800]   Let's take your time, Veronica.
[01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:11.800]   You'd be.
[01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:12.800]   I read too fast.
[01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:14.040]   I can't help it.
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:15.040]   Do you really?
[01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:16.240]   Not super fast.
[01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:20.040]   You read on paper books or do you read a Kindle or do you listen Audible?
[01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:21.040]   What is your?
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:22.040]   All three actually.
[01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:26.280]   I'm usually listening and reading two different things between paper.
[01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:27.280]   Me too.
[01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:29.360]   Audible and Kindle at any given time.
[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:31.800]   I just finished reading The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.
[01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:33.800]   I'm reading the first one on Audible.
[01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:36.080]   I'm reading the first one The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.
[01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:37.320]   It is good, isn't it?
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:38.320]   It's great.
[01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:40.400]   This is one of my favorite narrators.
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:43.600]   And anything he does on Audible is fantastic.
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:46.440]   And right now I'm reading The Blade Itself by Joe Abercrombie.
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:48.400]   I'm reading that on Kindle.
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:51.760]   And I'm also reading a new Robin Hobb book in Hardcover.
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:53.400]   I can't remember the name of it right now.
[01:09:53.400 --> 01:09:54.560]   How do you have time to read?
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:55.560]   When do you have time to read?
[01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:58.960]   I read before I go to bed at night and on airplanes, which I'm on a lot.
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:09:59.960]   You're on a lot of it.
[01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:00.960]   It's time to go to bed at night.
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:01.960]   Yeah.
[01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:02.960]   Really?
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:03.960]   No kidding.
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:05.600]   All the few games.
[01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:07.080]   Much later and later every night of the season.
[01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:09.680]   Video games are very bad for your sleep habits.
[01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:10.680]   That's true.
[01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:11.680]   I'll give you that.
[01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:12.680]   Audible.com/twit2.
[01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:14.560]   Give it a try.
[01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:15.560]   We love it.
[01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:16.560]   We know you'll love it too.
[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:17.720]   And we thank Audible for their support.
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:20.840]   So you all already got your iPhone orders in, huh?
[01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:21.840]   Yay.
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:23.320]   I'm holding out for a white one.
[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:24.320]   And they have an all three of those.
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:25.320]   And they get three of those.
[01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:28.280]   So I guess I'll just have to go wait in line or something.
[01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:29.280]   Right.
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:32.040]   600,000 on day one.
[01:10:32.040 --> 01:10:35.720]   Despite the fact that AT&C servers sucked and nobody could get through it, I didn't
[01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:36.720]   get through it.
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:39.280]   I tried a few times and then I said, oh, I'll just get it tomorrow.
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:40.280]   Big mistake.
[01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:46.520]   I came back the next day and they said, yeah, you can have your iPhone July 25th.
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:47.520]   So I'm still waiting.
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:50.120]   But you got, how many did you get, Jeff Kanata?
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:51.120]   Just one.
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:52.120]   But one's all you need.
[01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:53.120]   One's all you need.
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:54.960]   Because now I have three iPhones.
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:59.000]   And how about you, Veronica, Jodor and iPhone two?
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:00.560]   Were you one of the 600,000?
[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:01.560]   Yeah.
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:02.560]   Yes.
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:07.040]   And Ryan called me from San Francisco while I was at E3 and said, okay, do you want the
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:08.040]   16 or the 32?
[01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:10.600]   It's nice to have a question.
[01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:12.080]   Of course it's the 32.
[01:11:12.080 --> 01:11:13.080]   No, I got the 16.
[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:14.080]   What?
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:15.080]   Why did I hold on to that?
[01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:16.080]   You know what?
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:17.920]   Because I'm going to get a new one in a year.
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:19.400]   Good point.
[01:11:19.400 --> 01:11:21.760]   But don't you want to store things for that year?
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:23.160]   I mean, come on.
[01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:24.160]   I do.
[01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:25.160]   I did the same.
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:26.800]   And it was $761 freaking dollars.
[01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:28.040]   And I was very depressed.
[01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:30.000]   But what the hell?
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.520]   You know, it's a it's that now ships by July 14th.
[01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:34.880]   If you preorder now, so.
[01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:38.200]   But I have talked to a number of people who say they've gotten the email from Apple that
[01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:41.000]   their iPhone is in the process.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000]   Wow.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.000]   It's on its way.
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:44.640]   It's a magical time.
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:46.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:49.880]   My confirmation email is kind of one of my most prized possessions at the moment.
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:51.800]   I loaded up and stare at it.
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:55.960]   If it printed out and framed at this point, you guys are so pathetic.
[01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:58.960]   So, so, so sad.
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:01.880]   I think really those are the two stories of the week though, E3 and the iPhone.
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:03.320]   I don't know if there's anything else to it.
[01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:05.120]   Of course, they had to happen all at the same time.
[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:06.120]   Damn.
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:07.120]   Damn.
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:08.120]   You got to spread the stuff out.
[01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:09.120]   Well, there is that one weird story.
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:10.120]   And I mentioned it.
[01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:11.120]   So I'm going to just throw it in.
[01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:14.240]   It just creeps the hell out of me.
[01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:15.320]   Let's just from scene it.
[01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:25.480]   The let me let me pull up the story so I can get it exactly straight.
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:31.800]   The attorney general, I guess, is tweeting.
[01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:32.800]   It's just a weird use of Twitter.
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:33.800]   I'm sure if I can find it.
[01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:35.800]   Oh, don't search "cnet for Twitter", by the way.
[01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:36.800]   You'll never.
[01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:47.000]   Maybe if I search it for Twitter executions, that's got to be the only one.
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.200]   Oh, that sounds terrible.
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:51.480]   I know.
[01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:53.520]   Just kind of a weird, weird use.
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:56.360]   Well, look at all the results I got for Twitter executions.
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:13:00.440]   I guess if your last words are less than 140 characters.
[01:13:00.440 --> 01:13:02.840]   Yeah, the Utah, that's right.
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:03.840]   There's the state.
[01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:04.840]   In fact, you have the link in the chatroom.
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:06.240]   Can you throw me the link?
[01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:08.200]   I'm having a hard time.
[01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:09.200]   I had it up here.
[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:10.200]   There it is.
[01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:11.200]   Thank you very much.
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:12.200]   Eli.
[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:14.600]   Utah uses Twitter to announce.
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:15.800]   Oh, the book of Eli.
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:17.920]   Yeah, that's a good book.
[01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:27.000]   The state of Utah, Mark Schurtlaff, who was the attorney general, tweeted a solemn day
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:31.480]   barring a stay by Superior Court and with my final nod, Utah will use most extreme power
[01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:34.800]   and execute a killer, mourn his victim's justice.
[01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:39.920]   And then tweets, I gave, just gave the go ahead to Corrections Director to proceed with
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:40.920]   the execution.
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:41.920]   A few hours.
[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:45.000]   I mean, just really, I don't know.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.000]   That's just a...
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:52.280]   It's crass, but if you think of Twitter as a news delivery service, it's the use of a
[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:53.280]   news, it's delivering news.
[01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:55.880]   And it's in, you know, it asks you, what are you doing right now?
[01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:56.880]   He answered the question.
[01:13:56.880 --> 01:13:58.800]   No, it doesn't ask you that anymore.
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:13:59.800]   Oh, it doesn't...
[01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:00.800]   You know what's interesting?
[01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:02.800]   A hundred people retweeted it.
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:03.800]   So obviously...
[01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:05.800]   Well, if you're following that guy, I mean...
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:06.800]   Yeah, that's a big story.
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:09.600]   That's the kind of stuff he's gonna tweet about, I guess.
[01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:12.240]   What's the weirdest thing you ever tweeted?
[01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:13.240]   Me?
[01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:14.240]   Yeah, anyone.
[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:15.240]   Oh.
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:16.240]   Um...
[01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:18.200]   You wouldn't tweet anything too personal, would you?
[01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:22.280]   No, I try to stay away from the two TMI kind of stuff.
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:23.280]   Yeah.
[01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:24.880]   So I can't really think of anything off the top of my head.
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:25.880]   I can't...
[01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:26.880]   Mundane, mostly.
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:27.880]   I'm pretty mundane.
[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:28.880]   I've been pretty good about it so far.
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:33.640]   I know Santa Con last year, a bunch of drunken people dressed up as Santa roaming around San
[01:14:33.640 --> 01:14:35.640]   Francisco posted some...
[01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:38.640]   Let's say lewd pictures from that.
[01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:40.560]   This isn't weird.
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:41.840]   It was just totally random.
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:46.000]   We were driving home from work with my producer Heather, and I looked to my right and there's
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:50.720]   this truck with like plexiglass walls and a big stripper pole in the middle.
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:55.440]   And I was like, "Yep, going up 101 North and just past the stripper truck."
[01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:57.240]   Okay, there you go.
[01:14:57.240 --> 01:14:58.240]   The Hustler stripper truck.
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:14:59.240]   There you go.
[01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:00.520]   I tweet my weight.
[01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:01.720]   That's kind of creepy.
[01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:02.720]   Huh.
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:03.720]   Yeah.
[01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:04.720]   Huh.
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:05.720]   That says Jeff Gester.
[01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:08.720]   They only have 140 characters, so I can't do that.
[01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:09.720]   Oh.
[01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:10.720]   Boom.
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:11.720]   Tell me about...
[01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:12.920]   Jeff, tell me about your latest venture.
[01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:13.920]   This is...
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:16.240]   It's called Giant Bomb.
[01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:17.240]   Yes.
[01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:18.240]   Yes.
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:19.240]   Giantbomb.com.
[01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:23.920]   We've started this video game site and it's from the people that made comicvine.com and
[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:26.720]   I'm working with Shelby Bonny, who's one of the founders of the CNET.
[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:27.720]   Oh, I know.
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:28.720]   Shelby.
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:29.720]   Yeah.
[01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:31.400]   And we came together and built this site.
[01:15:31.400 --> 01:15:33.360]   I like the attitude that's reflecting.
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:34.360]   It's just...
[01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:37.840]   Well, we wanted to cut through a lot of the stuff.
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:42.200]   We were at a point now where we were at a point where previews of video games were so
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:45.360]   painstakingly neutral, where it was just, "We're all going to give them the benefit
[01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:46.360]   of the doubt."
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:51.120]   And everything was written from that third-person editorial we perspective.
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:55.000]   The thing back in the day I used to get is I would spend, let's say, a full week reviewing
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:59.480]   a game, post the review, and then get messages from users asking, "So what did you think
[01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:00.480]   of the game?"
[01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:03.880]   I'm like, "Well, don't you get that from what..."
[01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:06.920]   And I eventually came to realize, "No, they're not really getting that."
[01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:12.800]   So we focused more on really just saying what's on our minds and going with the editorial
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:14.160]   first person and trying to love.
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:15.160]   It's very personal, which you love.
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:18.160]   And then the final ones, the final ones, the final ones, the final ones.
[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:22.160]   And I think that's the point where we're going to be able to do a game, and we're going
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:27.160]   to be able to do a game, and we're going to be able to do a game, and we're going to
[01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:31.160]   be able to do a game, and we're going to be able to do a game, and we're going to be
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:35.160]   able to do a game, and we're going to be able to do a game, and we're going to be able to
[01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:40.160]   do a game, and we're going to be able to do a game, and we're going to be able to do a
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:44.160]   game, and we're going to be able to do a game, and we're going to be able to do a game,
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:48.720]   and realize that even if you disagree with us, you're going to be able to get something
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:51.880]   informative and get something useful out of our reviews and out of our coverage.
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:53.240]   And that's been the main design.
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:58.040]   That's backed up with a lot of video content of us just having fun with this stuff.
[01:16:58.040 --> 01:16:59.200]   It's still video games.
[01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:00.200]   We're not doctors.
[01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:01.440]   We're not curing disease.
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:04.600]   It should still be a little bit on the fun side.
[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:08.680]   So we're trying to keep things light while also providing some hard hitting reviews to
[01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:09.680]   back that up.
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:11.040]   Well, it's great to meet you finally.
[01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:12.040]   Thank you for coming by.
[01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:13.040]   Good to be here.
[01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:19.880]   Jeff Kanata, he is the host of the Totally Rod Show TRS on our Vision 3 Totally Rod Show
[01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:20.880]   dot com.
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:21.880]   That's right.
[01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:22.880]   You guys are having fun.
[01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:24.360]   We're having a blast.
[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:29.400]   We do video games and movies, and I also do a show called We Can Confirmed with the Shack
[01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:30.680]   News Guys.
[01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:33.280]   That is a video game centric podcast.
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:34.280]   So, oh, that's cool.
[01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:35.280]   Check that out as well.
[01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:36.280]   Where is that?
[01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:37.280]   What online?
[01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:39.880]   On Shack News.com, you can also find it on iTunes, of course.
[01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:44.040]   And SHA, CK, any of us.
[01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:45.040]   Shack News.com.
[01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:46.040]   Yeah.
[01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:47.040]   Good.
[01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:48.040]   I'll have to off to look that up, Jeff.
[01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:49.720]   I didn't know you were doing that.
[01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:52.680]   That's cool.
[01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:54.120]   And thank you for being here.
[01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:56.240]   Once a year, whether you want to or not.
[01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:57.400]   I'll see you next year.
[01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:58.920]   No, come back sooner than that, Jeff.
[01:17:58.920 --> 01:17:59.920]   Really absolutely.
[01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:00.920]   Nice to see you again.
[01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:07.440]   Veronica Belmont is the host of Core Q-O-R-E soon to be on the new PlayStation 3 network.
[01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:08.440]   What is that all about?
[01:18:08.440 --> 01:18:10.800]   Yeah, we're going to be available on PlayStation Plus.
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:14.480]   So, if you've subscribed to PlayStation Plus, you'll get Core for free.
[01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:18.080]   But you can also download the individual episodes if you don't want to pay for PlayStation
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:19.080]   Plus.
[01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:25.560]   And of course, host Tekzilla with my old friend Patrick Norton on revision3tekzil.com.
[01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:26.960]   And Sword and Laser.
[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:31.920]   And with Tom Merritt, Sword and Laser, you guys were trying to get that over here at
[01:18:31.920 --> 01:18:32.920]   some point.
[01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:34.480]   I'd love to get you doing it over here.
[01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:35.600]   I know that would be really...
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:40.760]   The problem is my schedule is so wonky that I can't commit to a certain time a week with
[01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:41.920]   video and stuff.
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:44.160]   So we just do sort of laser whenever we have time.
[01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:47.560]   Well, you know that Veronica...
[01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:51.040]   It goes without saying any time you want to do anything over here, you're always welcome.
[01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:53.240]   I shouldn't have to say that.
[01:18:53.240 --> 01:18:55.480]   But now that we've got Tom...
[01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:56.480]   I know.
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:18:57.680]   You've got to get Veronica.
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:18:59.480]   Tom's doing great, huh?
[01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:00.480]   I love it.
[01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:01.480]   His show TNT.
[01:19:01.480 --> 01:19:09.040]   Tek News today is every Monday through Friday at 2.30 Pacific Time 5.30 Eastern.
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:11.280]   And we do it live.tv or you could subscribe to it.
[01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:13.040]   And yeah, it is a huge show.
[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:16.600]   It was number one on iTunes for several weeks and it's just taken off.
[01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:17.600]   So I'm really...
[01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:20.360]   He's doing a great job with Becky Worley as a regular on that.
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:21.560]   Yeah, she's great.
[01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:22.560]   Yeah.
[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:23.560]   She's also an old friend.
[01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:26.920]   It's kind of nice to be able to bring all my friends back.
[01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:27.920]   Thanks Veronica.
[01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:28.920]   Thanks Jeff.
[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:29.920]   Thanks Jeff.
[01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:30.920]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:37.560]   You can quit every Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern, 2200 UTC at live.twit.tv.
[01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:43.160]   If you want to watch live, of course you can always get the download from lots of places.
[01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:44.440]   Just go to twit.tv.
[01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:47.520]   In fact, there's a subscribe drop down.
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:49.880]   You can get it in the Zoom marketplace on iTunes.
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:55.400]   We have video too as well as audio and it's on YouTube, youtube.com/twit.
[01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:57.280]   So however you'd like to consume it, please do.
[01:19:57.280 --> 01:20:01.440]   And I believe we've got streaming coming very soon to not only Roku but all the media fly
[01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:02.440]   platforms.
[01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:04.880]   We're this close to being able to...
[01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:05.880]   So that's my goal.
[01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:10.160]   You go to your Roku box or you go to your Android or your iPhone and you get to choose.
[01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:13.040]   Well, I'll watch what's on right now or no, I don't want to see what's on right now.
[01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:16.200]   So I'll watch a show that was recorded earlier.
[01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:18.000]   You get the choice.
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:19.240]   That's coming very, very soon.
[01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:20.240]   Thanks everybody for being here.
[01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:21.240]   We'll see you next time.
[01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:22.240]   Another twit.
[01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:23.240]   He's in McCann.
[01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:24.240]   Alright, thanks Veronica.
[01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:25.240]   Oh, happy father's here.
[01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:30.240]   Alright, thanks Veronica.
[01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:32.240]   Oh, happy father's daily.
[01:20:32.240 --> 01:20:33.240]   I'm like you live on a twit.
[01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:34.240]   Yeah, happy father's day.
[01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:35.240]   Am I the only dad here?
[01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:36.240]   I think I am.
[01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:37.240]   I'm me.
[01:20:37.240 --> 01:20:38.240]   Not that I know of.
[01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:39.240]   Cross.
