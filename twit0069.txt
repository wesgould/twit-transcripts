[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.040]   Just a couple of twits right now, maybe we'll add some more as time goes by depending on
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.840]   the twit connectivity from Slam Dance Industries, Mr. Patrick Norton of DL.tv.
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.880]   >> Hi everybody.
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.880]   >> Hey Patrick.
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.480]   Why Slam Dance Industries?
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.480]   What does that mean?
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:33.600]   >> Slam Dance Industry, it was, because Slamdance.com was picked up by a film festival down in LA.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.360]   So that was as close as you could get.
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.840]   Well, no, I own Slamdance.net and Slamdance.org, but yeah.
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.120]   They were just looking for a nice two word name.
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.480]   So that was the best I could do and what was available.
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.440]   >> So basically what you're telling us is you've given away your Skype name to the public now.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.440]   >> No, no, he's talking about the website.
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.440]   >> The Leo has actually.
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.520]   >> No, no, no, I didn't mention, because that's the name of your blog, but now I'll take that
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.520]   part out.
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.520]   Ladies and gentlemen also here.
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.520]   >> Yeah, I'll leave it in.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.520]   He needs to, the guy needs attention.
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.520]   >> Really?
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.520]   I think he's pretty busy.
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.520]   >> He needs to be busy.
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.320]   >> Do you need attention, Patrick?
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.280]   >> No, I'm good actually.
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.520]   My email and my IM are publicly enough as it is.
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.720]   I get into some highly amusing conversations.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.160]   >> Do you know, I doubt either of you.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.400]   >> No, I don't leave Skype on all the time.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.400]   >> No.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.760]   >> No, because then it really, people would call all the time if they could figure out
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.760]   who you are.
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.760]   I mean, John's is not.
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.480]   >> Well until recently actually, nobody really knew what my Skype name was until just moments
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.480]   ago.
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.480]   >> Until moments ago.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.480]   >> I don't know yet.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.480]   >> I don't know.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.600]   >> I never get that person because I just put my name out there.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.120]   You know, you want to, you're John C. Devorak is my Skype name.
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.600]   >> People are scared of you, though, John.
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.600]   They don't call you.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.560]   They're not unapproachable of us.
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.960]   >> They should be scared of Patrick more than they are of me.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.560]   >> They're talking about linebackers, you know what I'm saying?
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.560]   >> You're absolutely right.
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.960]   >> Like a wide receiver of this.
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.480]   >> You wear this mighty sledgehammer.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.800]   I remember getting a call.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.520]   We were in Louisville, Kentucky, and I remember getting a call in the hotel room at 6 o'clock.
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.440]   I foolishly checked in on my own name from a tech TV fan and say, "Hey, how are you?
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.440]   Welcome to Louisville."
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.600]   >> I'll say thank you very much.
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.600]   Good morning.
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.600]   >> You want to try to sleep.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.600]   >> You want to be in julip?
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.600]   >> Yeah.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.480]   I mean, people think we're, I think because we were on TV so much, Patrick, they just
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.040]   think we're, you know, approachable.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.040]   We're friends.
[00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.040]   They know us.
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.040]   >> We've been in their house.
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.040]   They're limited.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.480]   >> You know, I'd have to tell you some funny thing is people, you know, I've done as much
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.040]   media, but people don't aid.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.680]   They don't think I'm approachable.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.360]   And B, when they approach me, I'm like so normalized.
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.360]   >> They don't think it's law.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.360]   >> They don't think it's law.
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.040]   >> Well, not saying that, but they're very disappointed.
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.840]   >> Yeah, they want you to be tricky.
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.320]   >> Well, they want something more than just some jerk that just standing around like anybody
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.320]   else.
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.320]   >> How are you?
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.320]   >> I'm missing.
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.320]   >> Yeah.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.320]   >> I'm done.
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.320]   >> What do you do for a living?
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.760]   >> I started interviewing him.
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:56.760]   That kind of drives him crazy.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:57.760]   It takes care of us.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.760]   >> Yeah.
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:59.760]   >> I want to do.
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.280]   John C. Devorex here, Devorex.org/blog.
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.280]   I'm sure you recognized the voice.
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.280]   We missed you last week.
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:11.120]   Glad to have you both back on the Twit, especially since now Twit is sponsored.
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.200]   And that means cash in your pockets for every show you're on.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.200]   Did you know that?
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.200]   >> In silver.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.200]   >> In silver.
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.200]   In dabloons.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.160]   Gold dabloons because that's how Visa pays us.
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:29.240]   This podcast is brought to you by Visa Smarter, something better, something money.
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.280]   If you're using a Visa, I have to do this.
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.360]   I have to, we got a number of complaints.
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.400]   People said, it's not clear when you're doing the commercial.
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.280]   I think when I start talking about Visa, that's pretty clear.
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.280]   It's a commercial.
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.440]   But I'm going to say now, this podcast brought to you by Visa.
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.560]   And then now you know it's commercial, right?
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.560]   >> Do you have a--
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.560]   >> Maybe you'd have an Uka horn.
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.320]   >> Do I have a what?
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.680]   >> A website to go to?
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.160]   >> I mean, Visa, I mean why does Visa have to advertise?
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.160]   Aren't they like this?
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.200]   >> That's a good question, but I'm not going to--
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.800]   >> No, I'm just saying because everybody knows who they are.
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.320]   >> No, everyone knows who they are.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.480]   It's like, there's two cars, Visa MasterCard, and then there's, I guess.
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.480]   >> Sean, Sean.
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:11.480]   >> Sean, you need to advertise.
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.880]   It's so important for their image.
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:14.880]   You know what they're trying to--
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.320]   >> Actually, they have the best image of all these guys.
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.320]   >> I think they do have the best image.
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.320]   >> Compared to what?
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.680]   They're indistinguishable from MasterCard, and they're in a long running battle with American
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.680]   Express.
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.680]   Maybe that's what it is.
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.680]   >> That's a different style.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.080]   American Express is a different game.
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.400]   >> I think so, too.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.040]   You may think so, but a lot of the public may not notice the difference.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.440]   >> Well, I think also when you get a credit card, do you have a really have a choice?
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.600]   Can you go to your bank and say, "Can I not have a MasterCard?"
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.600]   I'd prefer a Visa.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:39.600]   >> In some cases--
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.600]   >> Oh, you know, that's what these get there.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.560]   So, in other words, what Visa's doing by advertising is trying to-- it's really advertising
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.720]   to banks to get them to use them and so the other guys.
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.760]   >> The reason they want-- I'll tell you why they wanted to be on Twitch.
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.240]   They wanted-- and that's the whole network, by the way.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:58.200]   They wanted to tell people who understand security and who use their credit cards online
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:03.560]   that they're working to make sure that the fraud doesn't happen on Visa cards and they
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.840]   keep an eye on things and they actually do this.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.400]   I've had this happen where if somebody uses your card out of context, you get a call
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.400]   and they say, "You know."
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.000]   >> Or if you use your card out of context.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.160]   >> Well, I actually got that too.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.840]   When I started using it in Canada, they called and said, "Do you go to Canada a lot?"
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:17.840]   And I said, "Yes."
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:18.840]   And they said, "Oh, great.
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:19.840]   We're just checking."
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:20.840]   >> I don't want to--
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:21.840]   >> I think that's good.
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:22.840]   >> They said--
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.040]   >> Because it's really easy to get it shut off, like, you know, driving three hours to the
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.040]   right--
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.040]   >> My bank shut off my card.
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:31.880]   My bank shut off my ATM card because-- and I got a Canada-- I've been going Canada
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.440]   for two years.
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.280]   And like three months ago, they shut off my ATM because that's the one.
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.280]   >> That's the computer program fault.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.360]   I mean, they have programs that can tell that you bought an airline ticket.
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.360]   They did this, you did that.
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.360]   >> They would know.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.360]   >> They should put it all together.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.640]   >> Yeah, because basically they're following us around.
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:48.640]   >> I agree.
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:53.480]   >> But I was-- and lecture once with one of these bank card guys, and he had this very
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.000]   interesting thing to say, and it's actually happened to me.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.360]   He says, "If you want--" and anyone out there can try this.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.520]   This is a very good algorithm that they have that--
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.320]   >> They often use SaaS Institute stuff because I've talked to the SaaS people.
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.680]   >> There's some of that, but here's the trick.
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.560]   Here's what you want to do if you want to see if your card get killed.
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:17.920]   >> You can use your card for a couple of days, and then go buy two tanks of gas separately,
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.480]   buy a tank of gas with the card.
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.480]   And then buy another tank.
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.720]   In other words, have your wife or somebody.
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.720]   >> Within 15 minutes.
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.640]   >> No, right, like-- well, yeah, that's probably 15.
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:30.080]   But say just one, fill up and then charge it, and then fill up another tank.
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.480]   And if you really want to have some fun, do three.
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.400]   But fill up a bunch of tanks of gas like in a row.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:36.400]   >> They're trying to rent a 747.
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.560]   >> And then go buy a pair of Nike sneakers.
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:43.000]   >> That is actually an algorithm.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.520]   They found that a lot of kids--
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.160]   >> It's called urban profiling.
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.800]   >> A lot of kids steal a card, and the first thing they do according to the guy, they fill
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.080]   up their older buddies tanks full of gas.
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.080]   That's the first thing they do.
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.080]   >> Then they buy some shoes.
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.600]   >> Then they go buy some shoes.
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:02.040]   So I had a similar situation although I was buying a pair of pants, but it was at some
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.040]   one of these kinds of places.
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.040]   >> Interesting.
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:05.040]   And they--
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:07.400]   >> And they-- I know I didn't kill it, but I had to talk to somebody on the phone.
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.400]   >> Well, that's what they do.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.400]   >> They don't kill it right.
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.400]   >> Well, maybe so.
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:11.400]   >> Well, they kill my bank card.
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.400]   >> They kill my bank card.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.400]   >> Yeah.
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:14.400]   >> And they kill my bank card.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.400]   I was like, "We'll try that."
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:16.400]   >> Yeah, I do it.
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.400]   I just do it as a gag.
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.400]   >> All right.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.840]   >> And that concludes this Visa commercial.
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:24.440]   "Save for better money life takes Visa."
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:27.200]   How do you like that?
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.680]   >> I think we gave too much time.
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:33.200]   >> Yeah, but it was more than just a commercial because we learned something here.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:35.000]   We learned how to kill your credit card.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.800]   So the couple of big announcements this week, Tuesday, Apple, Showtime announcement, and
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:45.000]   Thursday, Microsoft Zoom announcement.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.800]   And you know, you've already heard all the details.
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.320]   The only thing about the Zoom that I thought-- there are two things I thought were very
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.320]   interesting.
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.160]   I'm like, you get both of your comments on this one.
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:57.720]   First of all, the Zoom will come in three colors, black and white, much like the iPod.
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.720]   And brown.
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:08:59.720]   >> Wow.
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:00.720]   Oh, brown.
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.720]   That kind of defines it, doesn't it?
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:03.720]   >> Brown.
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:04.720]   Yeah.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.200]   >> Now, of course, we need a woman on here.
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.200]   >> Trendy Brown.
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.200]   >> Is brown trendy?
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:13.400]   >> Yeah, amongst the guests of people at Microsoft who spent too much time in the bathroom.
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.440]   Oh, I'm sorry I said that.
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:17.240]   Okay, I was off-color joke.
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.800]   Hey, brown, off-color.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.600]   >> It's the number two color, right after white, they said.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.040]   >> Can you imagine?
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:27.520]   >> My question is, you know, I noticed this too with Ubuntu.
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.760]   Ubuntu is predominantly brown.
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:30.840]   Is brown the new black?
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:31.840]   Is that the new color?
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:32.840]   >> No.
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.080]   But the brown zoom actually looks pretty good.
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.080]   >> Would you buy a brown MP3 player?
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.080]   >> I wouldn't.
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.160]   >> I've got like four as it is.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.560]   I think I'm permanently out of the market.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.640]   >> So here's the other thing that I think is interesting.
[00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:51.160]   It will play copy protected songs from the zoom marketplace and then unprotected AAC,
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:52.720]   which is, that's good.
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:57.920]   MP3, Windows Media, JPEG for photos, H.264, MPEG4 and Windows Media.
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.360]   What's missing from that list?
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.200]   Microsoft's own place for sure protection.
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.200]   >> Well, let's-
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.200]   >> We block this.
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.200]   >> What's the deal?
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.200]   >> Well, it's-
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:11.640]   >> Right, but it seems like they're trying to- either they're establishing their own market
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:16.040]   and they don't want to share with the, what is it, 17?
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.560]   >> The Rhapsody and the Napster and all that.
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.560]   >> Yeah.
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.240]   >> You know, even the urge eyes is like, you know, we're there to participate if Microsoft
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.240]   wants us, but-
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:26.320]   >> So this isn't, this is not an accidental admission.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.320]   This is fact.
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.320]   They are not-
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.080]   >> It's got to be a huge blunder.
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.440]   This is a conflict of interest.
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:34.920]   This makes the company look like a bunch of buffoons.
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.920]   >> I agree, I think it's-
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:43.680]   >> You know, I was watching something the other day, which is, you know, Charlie Rose
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.080]   occasionally has actually a good guess that he can interview properly.
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.080]   >> I don't like Charlie Rose.
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.720]   I think he sees a jock sniffer.
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.320]   >> Well- >> He's always talking about money.
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.960]   He's always talking about how do you have that, your question is like, how does it feel
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:55.960]   to be rich?
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:59.440]   I remember seeing him once one time he walked into somebody's house and he pointed at a
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.600]   painting on the wall and said, what is something like this cost?
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.840]   These guys preoccupied with him.
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:04.840]   >> He does that.
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:06.000]   >> No, because he thinks the audience wants to know-
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   >> No, he doesn't.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.400]   He is like money hungry.
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.400]   >> No.
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.880]   >> But anyway- >> He wants to know that.
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:15.280]   >> Nobody cares what Michael Dell thinks of when he's-
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:20.800]   Anyway, so here's- he does this interview with Les Moonves, who's ahead of CBS at the
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:27.760]   beginning of this entire show, says, I'm not going to like say anything about Viacom or-
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.320]   you're not going to get- go there.
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:33.880]   But by the time this interview was over, he had this anecdote about synergism, which
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:40.160]   was directly related to the relationship of Viacom and CBS, which is in Paramount.
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.400]   And he made this point and I listened to this and I said, this is exactly the problem.
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.320]   And this is what's going on with this Microsoft device.
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:51.480]   And Moonves tells the story about when the movie studio brought out the movie Stepford
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:57.240]   Wives, they wanted to advertise to the 25 to 52 year old women, of which CBS had the
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:58.560]   dominant market share.
[00:11:58.560 --> 00:11:59.760]   They had most of them.
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:04.000]   He says in the advertising dollars, 85% of them went to NBC.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.680]   >> How does that work?
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:10.000]   >> He says it's all because people are like, they have these buddy relations.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.400]   You can't do anything about all these relationships that are preordained.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:19.800]   These buddies that are in the business that, who knows what goes on behind the scenes,
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:23.440]   that result in these kinds of what is basically a conflict of interest.
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:29.560]   And the fact that Microsoft doesn't use this, its own DRM in this system.
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:36.520]   >> Well, it's not its own DRM because it's the DRM other people use to play Microsoft
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:42.800]   devices, but they have this new DRM, the Zoom DRM, which is stuff only they sell apparently,
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:43.800]   right?
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:48.280]   >> Well, they're screwing your partner saying, yeah, well, we created a DRM that you can
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.680]   use and we're not going to use it.
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:53.320]   >> Right, I mean, that actually is what it means.
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.320]   >> It's stupid.
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:55.320]   >> But yeah, I know it's like they have-
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:59.520]   >> Well, you guys, you guys, you guys, they're manipulating their partners to get them to
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:00.520]   play along early.
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:03.120]   >> Oh, you think this is a negotiation ploy?
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:04.120]   >> This is their plan.
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:07.320]   It's the things like at least Matt if I were rhapsody in maps here.
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:11.280]   >> No, Patrick, I think that's a great theory if you're going to really actually think Microsoft
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.280]   can think like that.
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:13.280]   I mean, the fact is that-
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:16.160]   >> This is Microsoft's 3.0 on DRM, John.
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.160]   That's what it is with me.
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.160]   >> Microsoft 3.0.
[00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:23.200]   >> Microsoft has not been able to market anything for crap except for their office suite and
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.200]   windows and they keep dropping the-
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:29.280]   >> They killed Netscape and they also, they killed in the market or threatened-
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:31.480]   >> Well, no, I'm not saying they can't kill people.
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.280]   >> They killed people with their weight.
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:34.440]   >> It doesn't do them any good.
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.840]   I mean, what benefit was it to kill Netscape?
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:39.440]   >> I mean, what was the benefit?
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.600]   What was the actual long term-
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.600]   >> And the way they killed it-
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.600]   >> They thought it was threatening.
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.600]   >> They thought.
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:44.600]   >> They were wrong.
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.600]   >> I'm not saying it's rational.
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.000]   >> Well, that's what I'm trying to point out.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.160]   >> So who are they trying to kill here?
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:55.160]   What is the value?
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:56.160]   >> The long term.
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:58.880]   >> Your target is obviously they're embarrassed by the market share that Apple holds.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:13:59.880]   >> Right.
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:00.880]   >> They're trying to kill Apple.
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:01.880]   >> Oh, please.
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:06.400]   >> But the way they're killing them is by dumping on their existing partners seems to
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.400]   me-
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.120]   >> No, that's why I don't believe that that's what's happening.
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.400]   I think it's just bone-headed incompetence.
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.880]   >> In any event.
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:13.960]   So you believe this is true.
[00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:14.960]   It's not an omission.
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:20.600]   It's not an accident that they actually do not plan to support place for sure on the
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:21.600]   Zoom.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.160]   >> Yeah, I think it's just a complete, just in-
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.320]   >> That's crazy.
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:30.760]   And you, Patrick, think it's a negotiating ploy to get wraps at a Yahoo, all these partners
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:34.280]   to do something, kick in more money.
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.520]   I mean, what do they want them to do?
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:36.920]   >> What could be a negotiating ploy?
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:41.320]   Part of what I was saying is the whole reason for them to kill off Netscape is if somebody
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:44.520]   was smart enough to know that people are going to spend a lot of time in browsers and they
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:48.680]   wanted to control that avenue out of the Windows desktop, right?
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:53.400]   You know, series like the 1.0 product for them is a DRM, which was adopted by a ton of
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:57.920]   partners and it's pretty much the only, you know, their DRM is the place for sure.
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:58.920]   >> This is the surestuff you're talking about.
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.320]   >> No, actually, I haven't even gotten to play for sure yet.
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:03.080]   Play for sure is like the 2.0 product.
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:08.000]   The 1.0 product is their DRM, the 2.0 product, you know, which is adopted by half the planet,
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   right?
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.240]   >> Yeah, the 3.0 product is when they realize the end users are having a nightmare experience
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:17.880]   getting stuff to play on the different, you know, Windows compatible MP3 players as they
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:22.280]   inaugurate plays for sure to try to make all of these things, you know, behave proper.
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:23.280]   >> Right, right, right.
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:26.400]   >> And then they realize that even if they got, you know, made the situation more manageable
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:30.480]   and ran it through Windows Media Player and made behavior consistent and made sure the
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:35.200]   DRM worked, that didn't help much and now they're basically, they're going to market,
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:38.920]   you know, these portable players, the Zoom and just try to start digging away at Apple's
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:39.920]   market share.
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:44.080]   >> Yeah, I think they've got the resources to do it if they do it, right?
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:46.680]   Especially if somebody Xbox Live gave me on there.
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:50.360]   >> Just always had the resources to do anything they want.
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:54.160]   I mean, that's, I mean, the fact that they're doing it with the Xbox is kind of a miracle
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:58.880]   because half the time they get into something, they make a little money, maybe some profits
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:02.960]   even and they don't like those margins compared to what they're used to and they bail out
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.640]   and they bail out and they bail out and they don't.
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:10.160]   >> Is the Zoon an ego move where they're just, it's not a market they really care or want
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:14.000]   to be in but they just hate it that Apple owns this market that has 80% market share
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   in this market?
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.240]   >> I think they care a lot about the movie market, right?
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:21.720]   The movie download market and they pretty much own that in the sense of theirs is kind
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:24.720]   of the standard, you know, until this recent announcement by Apple.
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:26.480]   >> But they got to scare it though by this new iTunes.
[00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:30.080]   I mean, cinema now is not anywhere near as good as the iTunes Music Store do you think?
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:32.600]   >> I don't know the iTunes, I don't know if the iTunes Music Store move.
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.200]   >> The movie situation is that good, really?
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:36.200]   >> Really?
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.200]   >> I mean, be perfectly honest with you, it's 640x480 movies, at least they're getting
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:42.280]   like DVD quality on the stuff that's coming through cinema now.
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:43.280]   >> Is it cinema?
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:44.280]   >> It's something that's...
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:47.080]   >> So what you're saying cinema now is better quality than the 640x40?
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.080]   >> I think so.
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:52.280]   I mean, at least they can do, you know, DVD's, you know, standardish wide format.
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:53.640]   I haven't downloaded too many movies.
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:57.200]   >> The 640x40 will do wide format but what happens, you get black bars top and bottom,
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.200]   so it's not 480.
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.360]   >> You always get black bars.
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:00.360]   >> Right.
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:04.400]   >> I mean, this is essentially, I don't think, what I'm saying is I don't think it's, I haven't
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:08.240]   downloaded enough of the long format stuff but unless they're downloading considerably
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:10.400]   faster, I'm not sure they have a huge advantage.
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.400]   Except for that.
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.640]   >> They're about two gigs, they're about two gigs in the file size which is I think comparable
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:15.640]   to cinema now, isn't it?
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:16.640]   >> Very comparable.
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:21.200]   But how long is it, is it two gigs like, you know, cinema now and, and, and, and, and
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.000]   un-body, you know, Amazon's un-box.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.280]   Like the difference is the Amazon un-box and cinema now outside of one click shopping,
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:28.280]   impossible to tell.
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.280]   >> Right.
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:34.280]   >> Some I have with one box, or un-box and, and cinema now is the Windows DRM.
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:37.920]   I mean, this, there's Apple DRM on it but it seems a little bit easier to manipulate,
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.800]   you can move it around, you can have it on an iPod.
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:43.920]   >> You can do that with, well, you can do that with the, with the Windows DRM too.
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:47.600]   >> You can't, and neither of them will let you burn a DVD which is of course what people.
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:51.200]   >> Actually the cinema now, some of the titles are allowed to burn on the cinema now.
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.200]   >> Okay.
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.640]   >> Depends on the, it depends on the copyright holder.
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.680]   That's totally a decision by the copyright holder.
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:58.120]   >> So what kind of titles are we talking about here?
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.120]   >> Towers.
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:01.920]   >> The cinema now stuff and the Amazon on all crap.
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:04.320]   >> No, actually a lot of new crap.
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:05.320]   A tremendous amount.
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.560]   Have you ever been to cinema now?
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:07.560]   >> No.
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:11.160]   >> They've, they've really increased, for a while it was junk and they've really increased
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.160]   it.
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.240]   The same thing will happen on iTunes though.
[00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:17.200]   I mean, the same, right now it's only Disney because that's where Jobs has a relationship
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:18.200]   relationship.
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.080]   >> Yeah, relationship he owns most of the stock.
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:21.080]   >> Yeah.
[00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:25.200]   >> But I think the same thing happened with the TV shows and as soon as people see it working
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.200]   they're going to move there.
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.000]   >> I mean, it's, it's also because if you look at it, it's very similar to like the
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.440]   pay per view or it's amazing like I don't know if you guys that like the safe way by
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:36.160]   you guys have it yet but the safe way down the street now has the you know dollar a night
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.160]   video rental key.
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.160]   >> Yeah, but I don't want to go out the door.
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.320]   I want to get my movies now and I want to without.
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:43.640]   >> Well the problem is is nobody's got movies now because you have to wait for a two gigabyte
[00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:47.320]   download or at least for the first 25 or 30% to queue up.
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:48.320]   >> Right.
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:49.320]   You can stream it.
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.160]   >> So you can stream it within 10 minutes or five minutes?
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:53.320]   >> No, well, you know, unbox.
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:54.960]   I haven't checked cinema now and a while.
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:59.840]   Cinema now usually takes about 25 minutes unbox was like the first couple days unbox was
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:03.840]   open was I have to check it again now that they've kind of settled in but I was getting
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.560]   like 160 K downloads.
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:07.320]   It was taken hours.
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.760]   >> Apple's optimized.
[00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:12.200]   So you're going to you're going to get pretty good throughput and unless they're gating
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:15.520]   in and I don't think they are it seems like it's coming in pretty fast and jobs claim that
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:18.720]   you would be able to stream it within a couple of minutes at beginning of the download.
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.520]   So that may be an advantage.
[00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:22.680]   I mean, I do think that from the point of games.
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:24.360]   >> Well, yeah, claims.
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:25.360]   I don't know.
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:26.360]   I have to try it.
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:29.280]   I do think from the point of view of the viewer that's that's the whole point is I don't want
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:30.680]   to leave the house.
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:34.000]   I want as close to the video and demand as possible and I want to keep it.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   That's the problem with video and demand.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   You can't keep it.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.800]   >> Well, there's a lot of video titles that you can actually purchase but again, you know,
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.880]   and this is like, you know, remember last week Corey was on and you're kind of like,
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:45.320]   well, I don't want anybody want to buy a video if it was DRM.
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:48.880]   I mean, it's it's a well, it's just like, look, you're going to have DRM.
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:49.880]   >> Yeah.
[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.280]   I'm not arguing with that.
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:55.840]   The question is how onerous is going to be and I think, you know, people will probably
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.680]   it's not going to put DVDs out of business.
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.960]   It's just another way of buying.
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.480]   I think, you know, I don't know.
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:04.640]   I haven't bought anything yet from them.
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.320]   I did buy some stuff from cinema now and I was unhappy with it.
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:10.720]   >> And I think that there are connections are still too slow to make this that practical.
[00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:15.720]   I mean, I guess it's okay to download something overnight, you know, and then watch it the
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:16.720]   next day.
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:19.320]   But gee, I mean, we don't even have the kinds of speed that you need to really do this
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:20.320]   efficiently.
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:21.320]   >> Ridiculous.
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:27.000]   >> Spam house, a UK blacklist site was sued in Illinois court.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.280]   They're a there from the UK.
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:30.240]   They didn't bother to respond.
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:36.000]   The spammer alleged spammer who sued them 360 insight E 360 insight one in $11 million,
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.760]   $11.7 million judgment just because it was a default judgment.
[00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:41.760]   Spam house didn't show up.
[00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.120]   But apparently, spam house has said, man, we don't have to pay.
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:45.760]   We're in the UK.
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:47.520]   Default judgments are not recognizing the UK.
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:50.040]   So not only we're not going to show up for the trial, we're not going to pay them any
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:51.040]   money.
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:52.040]   >> Yeah, you can do this.
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:54.320]   I mean, yeah, we could do stuff here too.
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:59.600]   But that reminds me of an old story.
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:00.600]   >> All right.
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:04.440]   >> Never some years ago, at least five or six or maybe longer, where this guy was doing
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.480]   the Nazi site in the United States.
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:07.480]   >> Right.
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:10.120]   >> And it was like, you know, going into Germany because it was like on the internet.
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:15.720]   And the guy decided at least once in his life, go out of the country and float around.
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:18.400]   He wasn't going to go to Germany, but he stopped off in Netherlands.
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:19.400]   >> Big mistake.
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.400]   >> In Holland.
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.000]   >> They picked him up and he threw him in a German jail.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   >> Right.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   >> You can never travel now.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.240]   >> Yeah, these guys basically can never travel.
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.240]   So great.
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.800]   Okay, hey, you have a lot of fun with your money in England.
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.600]   And you know, you got, I mean, you're going to have a lot of money.
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.080]   You think you want to get out of the country?
[00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:35.080]   >> I mean, this is spam house.
[00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:39.720]   This is one of the most popular black hole lists or, I think it's the correct way of
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:44.120]   putting it for people who maintain, you know, spam tools.
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:46.120]   You know what I mean?
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:51.120]   It's like saying, you know, we've declared a judgement against Apache and it's like,
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:52.120]   what does that mean?
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:55.600]   You know, it's basically a company that's commonly acknowledged online.
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:59.160]   And again, this is from a bunch of the reporting I've read.
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:02.400]   There's a lot of people are like, yeah, these guys are totally spammers.
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.080]   You know, and that's why they're black hole.
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:08.000]   But, you know, they took advantage of the legal system to try to get out from under that.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.040]   >> Yeah, they didn't work out for them.
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:17.000]   >> No, well, David Linhart, who's the guy behind E360, says, claims victory.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.040]   He says, spam house is a fanatical vigilante organization.
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:22.960]   And they've won.
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:27.080]   Of course, it doesn't get them off the black hole list, which is probably what he really
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.080]   wanted.
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:30.880]   >> You know, I have to say that black hole lists can be misused.
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:31.880]   >> Absolutely.
[00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:34.440]   >> There's, you know, often you can't get ahold of these guys to appeal.
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:35.440]   I've been black hole.
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:36.920]   My old servers are black hole.
[00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:40.200]   And it's pretty tough to get off those lists.
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:45.480]   Because somebody had once those IP address range for spamming, and then, you know, those
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:47.960]   IP address are kind of poisoned forever.
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:50.480]   >> Yeah, that's a problem, I think.
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:52.960]   But I know- >> Well, you know, the thing is, this
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:55.080]   is a funny kind of a situation.
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:56.240]   I agree with you.
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:00.120]   I think the black hole lists are bad, and these guys should be sued for like, but not,
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:04.600]   I mean, the fact that they got sued by a spammer, instead of by some legitimate guy.
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:08.520]   Because I've been, I've been on black hole lists, and we've seen them happen to all
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:12.720]   kinds of normal companies that just for some reason or another, because of some, you know,
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:15.280]   because these things are automated, or who knows what.
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.320]   A lot of them are like mechanical.
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:18.960]   It really screw up things.
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:22.160]   And so it's kind of, you know, I think black hole sites, I'm not a big fan of them, to
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.840]   be honest about, there's other ways of going about this.
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:29.960]   But at the same time, the irony of having a spammer, you know, sue the guy makes it
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:35.240]   like, well, you know, spam house says we don't block, this is kind of like the gun industry.
[00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:37.080]   We know, we know, lock them.
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:38.320]   ISPs block them.
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:39.960]   We just make a list.
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:41.800]   >> That's a good point.
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:44.040]   >> ISPs don't have to adhere to the list.
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:50.320]   In fact, you know, my ISP for a while turned against, as everybody wants to fight spam,
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.640]   they turned on some of these black hole lists.
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.520]   That's when I noticed that I was being black hole.
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:55.720]   I never noticed it until then.
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:57.840]   I couldn't get any mail at Leoville.
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:04.160]   And they turned it off because it frankly caused more false positives than it was worth.
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:05.160]   So I don't know.
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:06.160]   >> Well, I don't know.
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.160]   I mean, what do you guys think?
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.160]   I mean, it's like better ways to fight spam.
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.160]   >> There are better ways to fight spam.
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:12.760]   >> For one thing, there are never these guys coming like spam house with these guys, you
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:16.200]   know, or judgment proof, let's face that reality first of all.
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.920]   So the $11.7 million fine is bogus.
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:21.640]   Second thing is if they, you know, really get themselves into trouble, they'd get picked
[00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:25.240]   up if they tried to travel out of the country, which is, you know, it could happen.
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:28.740]   And they probably can't afford to fight the suit like this, which is what really should
[00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:33.400]   happen because the spammer shouldn't be able to sue anybody for anything.
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:34.400]   I don't know.
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:35.400]   I have mixed feelings about the whole thing.
[00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:36.400]   >> All right.
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:40.040]   To governor, the gubernatorial says you may not hold a cell phone to your ear while you
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:41.680]   are driving.
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:48.240]   State of California's passed a law, $50 fine, making it an infraction to hold a cell phone.
[00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.800]   It doesn't say hold a cell phone to your ear.
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:52.680]   It just says to hold a cell phone while driving.
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:57.600]   >> Yeah, you basically have to use it similar to the laws that are already in place in New
[00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:59.120]   York and other states where you.
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.200]   >> Jersey has that law.
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:02.320]   Actually, you're home state.
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:03.320]   >> It does.
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:04.320]   >> Yeah.
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:07.840]   New York, New Jersey, connect, kick it and Washington, D.C.
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:11.560]   >> The simple fact is it's dangerous to talk on your cell phone while driving.
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:13.160]   I will kill you.
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:15.840]   >> So getting people's hands off the phones and onto steering wheels is going to make
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:16.840]   a big difference for us.
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:18.800]   >> That's why you better work on it.
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:19.800]   >> I have to work on it.
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:20.800]   It's not guttural enough.
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:23.360]   >> Yeah, there's dog like they've got.
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:32.560]   Anyway, he says the law goes into effect in July in California.
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:36.840]   Commercial vehicles will continue to be able to use push to talk phones the next-house
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.960]   thing until 2011.
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:43.560]   >> This is like non- >> 20, you know what?
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:44.720]   You know what you should be looking at?
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:49.320]   What's kind of interesting about this story is that if you start watching the Metro news,
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:54.200]   the TV news, the local news, you're starting to see a lot of stories emerge, which I believe
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:56.080]   is from a public relations company.
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:26:01.000]   I can't prove this, but it just seems weird that they're all cropping up about how it's
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.080]   more dangerous to eat food while you're driving.
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:07.520]   It's more dangerous to turn to fiddle with the radio while you're driving.
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:08.520]   It's just as dangerous.
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:11.560]   People are putting makeup on and they're reading books while they're driving and doing all
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:12.560]   these things.
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:14.560]   So why is the cell phone being singled out?
[00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:19.160]   >> And yet I got a press release from Verizon Wireless congratulating the governor on his
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:24.120]   force site and praising the law and saying this is exactly the kind of law we wanted.
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:26.040]   >> I think they're scared of their liability.
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:32.680]   >> Well, the California highway patrol has maintained that cell phone uses a top cause
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:33.680]   of that.
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:34.680]   >> I think that's true.
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:37.680]   The only time I've ever been rear-ended, the guy was on a phone and admitted it.
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:38.680]   >> Yep.
[00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:41.160]   >> And I know when I'm on the phone, I drive like I'm drunk.
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:45.120]   In fact, that's what the studies say.
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.880]   Being on the phone is equivalent to being drunk.
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:52.320]   >> The other thing is these bogus stories that the local news TV stations are putting
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:56.840]   on, nobody, like I was yesterday or the day before I'm driving around and there's some
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:27:02.520]   woman and this is a really complicated traffic situation and she has to go out.
[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.560]   It's like a hard left turn to do.
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:05.560]   You got to go out.
[00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:08.840]   You got to go through some double yellows and there's a middle one of those middle turning
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:09.840]   lanes.
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:14.040]   It's five lanes total and you got to first move out and stand out there and then you got
[00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:16.320]   "and to make a left and ended moving traffic
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:18.280]   "is a really complicated maneuver."
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:19.540]   And I'm watching this woman
[00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:22.860]   and she's on the phone the whole time.
[00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:23.680]   - Oh God, I hate that.
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:26.180]   - I'm thinking this woman is going to be killed.
[00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:30.240]   Can't you get off the damn phone just to turn.
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:33.260]   I don't see anybody eating a hamburger
[00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:35.120]   or dipping french fries in the ketchup
[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:37.380]   or doing their make-up in a maneuver like that,
[00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:39.060]   but they'll be on the phone.
[00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:40.940]   - Well you don't wanna interrupt the conversation.
[00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:42.160]   It could be important.
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:45.600]   - Blap, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:47.240]   - Did you see the exploding think pad?
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:48.720]   You know, we talked last week about the fact
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:50.000]   you can't bring a Dell or a Mac
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.600]   on Virgin, Quandas, or Korean Airlines.
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.880]   - You can't bring toothpaste on any airline.
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:56.600]   - But you can't bring a Dell or Mac laptop,
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:58.240]   but apparently you could bring a think pad.
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:00.000]   Well now, according to Engadget,
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.080]   a think pad exploded at LAX,
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.360]   causing a bomb scare.
[00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:08.960]   Passer buys stared aghast or fled crying,
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:10.280]   "Terrorist!"
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:17.120]   - The think pad apparently burst in the flame
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:21.080]   and fortunately a United employee busted out
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:23.880]   a fire extinguisher and put the thing out.
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:28.880]   - Well you know, I'd like to have somebody go to this website
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:31.400]   that shows a picture of the thing that blew up.
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:32.240]   - Yeah, have you seen it?
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.600]   - Yeah, and there's a photo on Engadget,
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:37.560]   and it doesn't look like a think pad to me.
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:38.800]   - That does to me.
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.080]   - And it's not black.
[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:42.680]   Well it's dusty, it's not black now
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:45.120]   because it's covered with all sorts of stuff.
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.160]   - I guess they sprayed it, I guess, to put it out,
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:48.000]   but maybe--
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.320]   - Yeah, it has a lot of funny looking,
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:52.960]   the back of it just doesn't look right to me.
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:55.440]   - Look at it, Patrick, it's in the--
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:57.400]   - Is that a think pad?
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:58.240]   - It's delicious tags.
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:00.160]   Patrick uses a think pad, he should recognize it.
[00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:02.880]   That sure looks like a lot of tags.
[00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:04.240]   - Yeah, that's what they put on the back.
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:06.120]   - The part is, and it's huge.
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:07.880]   - I know, that's funny, there's a lot of junk
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:09.800]   on the back, a lot of the PC laptops.
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:10.840]   - They're not smooth.
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:13.380]   - A lot of second wall,
[00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:14.220]   pretty much a check pad.
[00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:15.880]   - You have your think pad expert.
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:17.480]   Let's see if we get Kevin Rose on the line here
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:19.920]   because you and Kevin used,
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:21.280]   actually Kevin's gone to the mat.
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:23.480]   - I used Toshiba, it hasn't blown up yet,
[00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:25.040]   so I'm a happy camper.
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:26.800]   - Yet.
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.400]   What's interesting is that they checked,
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:32.360]   and these batteries were not in a recall of any kind.
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:36.000]   IBM, Lenovo, not yet flagged for bad batteries.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.680]   So--
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:39.000]   - Well how about this for a concept?
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.400]   - I mean, I don't want to get too carried
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:42.320]   with these kinds of things, this kind of thinking,
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:45.160]   but is it possible that somebody set this up?
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.480]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.320]   - Oh yeah, sure.
[00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:48.160]   - You know what I'm saying?
[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:49.000]   - Absolutely. - There's like a phony deal
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:49.840]   that-- - More than possible.
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:51.360]   - Blow it up so they can take a little pressure
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:55.720]   off of the Dell Sony people, Sony Dell Apple.
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:56.560]   - Could be.
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:59.040]   - And by the way, how come a Sony laptop hasn't blown up?
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:00.600]   - Yeah, maybe they don't use Sony batteries
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:02.160]   and Sony laptops,
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:05.360]   or maybe they save the good stuff for themselves.
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:06.440]   - That's probably an IBM.
[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:07.440]   - That looks like it, doesn't it?
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:08.280]   That blows to me.
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:10.400]   - Yeah, in fact, it's probably a T42.
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:11.600]   It was just covered with the foam
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:12.440]   from the fire extinguisher.
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:15.000]   - Yeah, I was thinking, yeah, they probably sprayed it
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:15.840]   with something.
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:19.680]   - Wednesday, September 13th, 1956,
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:22.560]   the first hard drive was introduced by IBM.
[00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:25.800]   It's 50 years ago this week.
[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:28.160]   - So I went to the anniversary of a Zova--
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:29.000]   - Go to the party.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:29.840]   - It's your museum?
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:30.680]   - You did? - Yeah.
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:33.000]   And that museum, by the way,
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.200]   anyone who's in the area,
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:35.560]   it's in Mountain View,
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:38.040]   is a tremendous place to visit.
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:38.880]   - I agree.
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:41.160]   - Mainly 'cause they have a whole bunch
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:42.560]   of these old mainframes.
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:43.760]   - Did you see the core memory?
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:44.640]   They have a big old core memory.
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:46.160]   - They have a bunch of core memory.
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:47.560]   But the thing about these mainframes
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:49.520]   is these aren't mainframes from the 60s.
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:51.240]   These are mainframes from the 40s.
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:52.080]   - Yeah, that's cool.
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:55.080]   - They have a Johnny-ak, which I thought was kind of interesting.
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:56.960]   - Is that Enie-ak's little brother?
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.160]   - Johnny-ak was built by the same guy,
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:00.480]   so I think it was a one of a kind thing.
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:02.080]   It was built-- - That was Ecker-walkway.
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:04.840]   - And it was named after John Neumann.
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:05.680]   And they have it there.
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:07.120]   And apparently it's, I think, a one of a kind
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:10.480]   that they had this rescue from a junk dealer.
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:11.440]   But it's a really great place.
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.840]   But anyway, so I was there and they had what was cool about it
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:16.240]   besides the fact that they had some
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:19.520]   fairly depressing speeches was--
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:21.760]   - I remember 50 years ago.
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:23.240]   - Now the speeches were depressing
[00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:25.600]   because of the nature of what these guys are perceiving
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:27.680]   is that they had a future as a guy from Hitachi
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:28.680]   used to be with IBM.
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:30.880]   And his idea of the future was that you're never gonna be
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:32.520]   doing it about working 24/7.
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:33.360]   - Oh, that's great.
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:34.920]   - You get to see everything you get to do.
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:36.680]   Take notes while you're at dinner
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:40.040]   and you get to see your children's first walk.
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:41.680]   But you get to see remotely.
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:43.120]   - It's like, come on.
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:44.760]   This sounds like a miserable life.
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:46.840]   I thought it was the most depressing speech
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:47.840]   I've ever heard from anyone.
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:48.920]   - The future.
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:52.200]   We'll be able to work 80 hours a week.
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:54.040]   It's gonna be great.
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:57.960]   - But what was cool is they had an original Ramak running.
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:58.960]   - That's the hard drive.
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:00.640]   That's what the original-- - The original one.
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:02.840]   It was running. - And it was running.
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:04.280]   And so the thing that's weird about it,
[00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:05.960]   I didn't know this until I was at this,
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:07.800]   but I never thought about it much.
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:09.720]   But it has all these platters, right?
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:11.240]   The thing's about five or six feet high.
[00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:13.360]   - It's a big size of refrigerator.
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:14.920]   - Yeah, and it's got, it's five megabytes.
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:16.280]   It's a huge thing with all these platters.
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:17.200]   - Five megabytes.
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:18.120]   - Yeah.
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:20.000]   - And it's like five megabytes is spinning around
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.320]   at some high speed and the head to read the discs
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:27.120]   is one head that goes in, comes out, goes down,
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:29.040]   goes in, comes out, goes down.
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:30.520]   (laughing)
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:33.400]   - Through put of 500K per minute.
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:34.800]   - If you're lucky.
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:37.720]   - I can say it actually would have been slow
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:42.480]   compared to card entry, like throw a bunch of cards
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:43.800]   into a stack and a way to turn.
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:45.200]   - You know, that's why for a long time, I mean,
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:47.520]   seek time, we talked about seek time as a hard drive
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:48.640]   statistic, it was important.
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:52.000]   If you had a four minute seek time, that was relevant.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.520]   Good Lord, finding the data.
[00:32:54.520 --> 00:32:56.400]   Well, happy birthday hard drive.
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:58.400]   And you know, Gordon Bell and Gwen Bell,
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:00.720]   I think Gwen was very instrumental in starting up
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:01.800]   the Computer History Museum.
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:02.600]   They did a great job.
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:05.360]   - We had a number of people on the screensavers.
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:08.160]   - Yeah, well she managed to get a lot of this stuff collected
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:09.680]   but if you go there, I'm telling it,
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:12.240]   anybody in the country that listens to the,
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:14.160]   or in the world that listens to this podcast,
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:17.600]   if you're in Mountain View, you have to just go there
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:18.920]   to look at this old gear.
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:20.480]   It's really interesting.
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:21.800]   If you like computers at all.
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:23.640]   - Isn't it in one of the old hangers,
[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:24.480]   or the old blimp hangers?
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:25.520]   - No, no, those days are over.
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:29.200]   It moved to a fine facility, like a really fancy place
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.400]   right off of Shoreline.
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:31.240]   - Oh, I haven't been there.
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:32.080]   - In Mountain View.
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:33.600]   - It moved about four years ago.
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:35.080]   - Oh, there you go.
[00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:37.560]   - Shows how on top of it I am.
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:38.440]   - No, I mean, I was shocked.
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:39.360]   I haven't been there either.
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:41.080]   Last time I was there was at Moffatt Field
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:42.280]   when it was in the hanger.
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:44.240]   And I went and I was stunned.
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:45.080]   - Good for them.
[00:33:45.080 --> 00:33:45.920]   They raised a lot of money, I guess,
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:46.760]   and put it together together.
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:47.920]   - Yeah, apparently.
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:51.280]   - So we talked last week about the HP scandal
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:54.040]   and predicted at that time that heads would roll
[00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:56.760]   that most likely the scapegoat would end up being
[00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:58.480]   Chairman of the Board, Chairwoman of the Board,
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.520]   Patricia Dunn, in fact,
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:02.240]   is she has announced her resignation,
[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:04.480]   effective following the next board meeting,
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:05.560]   which is not till January,
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:06.680]   right about when Vista comes out,
[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:09.200]   January 18th, 2007.
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:10.240]   She's in trouble, of course,
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:13.120]   because of the leak investigation she inaugurated
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:15.120]   into not only her own board,
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:17.920]   but into nine journalists using pretexting
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:19.680]   to get phone numbers
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:23.480]   and phone records of these people.
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:24.960]   Hey, you know John Markoff pretty well,
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:27.280]   have you talked to him, John, about this?
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:29.280]   - Yeah, he's upset.
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:31.760]   - Hey, I'm not gonna say anything,
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:36.520]   but I believe that he and some of these other journalists
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:39.120]   that were pretext out like this
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:41.120]   are gonna sue the HP,
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:42.680]   gonna cost them a lot of money.
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:44.840]   And in that fact that Patricia Dunn is,
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:46.960]   she's quitting the Chairman's job,
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:48.520]   or Chairwoman's job,
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:50.280]   but she's staying on the board.
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:52.000]   I mean, I think it's unconscionable
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.080]   that this company has gone in this direction.
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:57.680]   It's just inexcusable.
[00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:00.240]   You know, they're leaving themselves open for all kinds
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:02.320]   of issues and they all have deep pockets,
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:04.120]   every one of those people on the board.
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:06.040]   I think that there's a lot of problems
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:09.880]   that are gonna, this is an unresolved situation.
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:11.920]   - She's gonna be replaced by HP President and CEO,
[00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:13.800]   Mark Hurd is a Chairman of the Board,
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:15.040]   but still on the board, wow.
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:16.640]   And you know, it's still up in the air,
[00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:19.920]   whether the State of California is gonna go after them
[00:35:19.920 --> 00:35:21.920]   in a criminal case,
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:23.880]   indictments, Billy Lockier says something,
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:24.840]   a crime has been committed,
[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:27.880]   we're just trying to figure out whether it's actionable.
[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:28.760]   - Well, it's gonna be interesting
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:30.280]   to see how the lawyers handle this,
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:32.360]   because I think a lot of this has to do with the,
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:34.120]   you know, and let's take a look at the lawyer
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:35.680]   that keeps coming up in the news here,
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.080]   and he comes up with his HP case,
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:38.840]   which is Larry Sancini.
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:39.960]   A lot of people are, you know,
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:42.520]   he's also one of the guys whose name keeps cropping up
[00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:45.040]   when it comes to these stock options problems
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:46.160]   that have occurred.
[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:47.720]   - Well, they're the big, that's a big,
[00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:49.000]   so it's the big firm. - It's the big firm.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.160]   It's the big boys, but I mean,
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:51.920]   they don't want to run Silicon Valley,
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:54.360]   but they're, I don't think this is good publicity.
[00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:55.200]   - Not for them.
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:57.240]   - Not for them. - I think this is really
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:59.600]   that uncommon, I mean, getting caught obviously
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:01.080]   is pretty good to guys think this kind of stuff
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:04.440]   is that uncommon and-- - I think it is uncommon.
[00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:05.800]   - Really? - Yeah, it's a dumb--
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:07.440]   - It is, it is, I do. - There's other things
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.800]   to do besides spying on your own board.
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:11.840]   There's other things to do besides spying on journalists.
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:14.600]   The last time that some company got their,
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:16.800]   Estonerringer was General Motors,
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:20.080]   when they put this private investigator on Nader,
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:22.440]   and it became a huge problem for the company
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:24.360]   that lasted for decades.
[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:26.840]   Every company knows that this can happen.
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:30.680]   The fall, or the pushback on this is extremely,
[00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:32.320]   it's an extreme situation,
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:34.440]   especially in the day and age that we have
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:36.000]   with privacy concerns.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.880]   This is the one of the biggest blunders
[00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:41.080]   anyone could possibly make in a million years.
[00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:43.560]   Yeah, if you got away with it fine, but--
[00:36:43.560 --> 00:36:44.480]   - I think it shows-- - Gee gosh,
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:45.920]   you didn't get away with it, did you?
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:48.200]   - You clearly shows incompetence on the part of the board,
[00:36:48.200 --> 00:36:50.000]   right? I mean, if she was doing this--
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.520]   - It's naive, it's hate more than incompetence.
[00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:53.960]   I mean, it's crazy.
[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:57.120]   It's why would you put yourself at this sort of risk?
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:58.600]   I mean, the public relations fallout
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:00.160]   from this must be unbelievable.
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:02.040]   I can't imagine what meetings are going on.
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:04.200]   - Ironically, didn't hurt the stock market.
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:05.640]   I don't know why-- - No, I won't hurt the stock
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:06.840]   for a while.
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:08.240]   - It could be-- - It doesn't hurt the market.
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:09.840]   - You think of the-- - It's a long-term problem.
[00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:11.000]   I mean, you get, you know, already,
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.200]   there's jokes floating around.
[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:14.880]   I mean, it's like, you know, it's not gonna help them.
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:17.920]   - E-Donkey, out of business, they are one of the big,
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:20.800]   along with, you know, Brockster and Morpheus,
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:24.600]   they're one of the big peer-to-peer file-sharing networks.
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:27.760]   The RIAA went after him hard.
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:31.440]   You know, saying, "We're gonna sue you."
[00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:34.120]   They-- E-Donkey actually paid, it says,
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:38.320]   according to ours, "Technica, $30 million to not be sued
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.720]   "and has shut the door and put up a sign saying--
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:44.280]   - Don't steal, if you steal music, you're breaking the law.
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:46.760]   - Which is what the record industry makes them do.
[00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:48.840]   That's, we've seen that before.
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:50.520]   That sign before.
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:53.320]   - I love that sign.
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:55.580]   (laughing)
[00:37:55.580 --> 00:38:00.320]   It's like, it's like, just another one bites the dust.
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:02.160]   So, 'cause I coughed up 100 million.
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:03.760]   I think the record industry's found a new way
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:05.400]   to actually make money that might be a little better
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:06.920]   than selling record.
[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:07.760]   (laughing)
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:10.000]   - Yeah, and another way that the artist gets screwed.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.160]   You know, before this story ran, I never heard of E-Donkey.
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:14.040]   - Oh, it was very popular.
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:16.760]   In fact, it was one of the more popular sites
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:19.560]   when we were talking about these things on that tech TV.
[00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:21.840]   And I think it's, you know, it's one of those things
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:25.000]   where there are fashions with the kids.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.640]   But this was very fashionable, wasn't it, Patrick?
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:27.480]   I think it was very popular.
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:29.160]   - E-Donkey was extremely popular.
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:30.000]   - Yeah.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.160]   - So, this shows you.
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:34.000]   - Yeah, it shows you.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.400]   - But you know, you can plug these things up
[00:38:35.400 --> 00:38:36.440]   and it doesn't matter.
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:38.680]   There's still plenty of ways to get music illegally.
[00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:41.800]   I don't think they can ever plug them all on.
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.280]   Maybe that's their plan though.
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:44.880]   - This is one that scared me.
[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:47.920]   Are you familiar with the Tor servers?
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:52.000]   The idea is they're anonymizing servers.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:52.840]   - Right.
[00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:53.680]   Zero knowledge.
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:57.080]   Is it EFF project or is EFF just pushing really hard?
[00:38:57.080 --> 00:39:00.040]   - EFF has a Tor site and that's why I'm not,
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:03.000]   it's tor.eff.org.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.280]   It stands for the onion router.
[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:06.160]   And it is very much like zero knowledge.
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:08.000]   It's an onion of servers.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.920]   And you anonymize by hopping through random numbers
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:14.040]   of servers to get where you're going.
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:16.760]   Little scary.
[00:39:16.760 --> 00:39:18.720]   - Why?
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:19.840]   - Germany. - Is it scary?
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:22.320]   - Germany during a child porn crackdown
[00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:26.240]   seized Tor servers.
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:29.480]   And they're looking at logs.
[00:39:29.480 --> 00:39:31.440]   German prosecutors have been trying to locate
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:34.000]   an anonymous child porn server
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.640]   by seizing the Tor servers and looking at the logs.
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:40.680]   Now, I don't know if the Tor servers,
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:43.600]   I'm sure they do have automated processes
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:44.920]   that delete the logs.
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:47.200]   But it makes you wonder,
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:49.720]   you use these Tor servers with the presumption
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:52.840]   that you're absolutely anonymous.
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:55.120]   - Yeah, you have to always wonder about anything
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:57.120]   like this, whether it's a honey pot or not.
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:58.280]   I mean, you always have to make it sense.
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:39:59.120]   - Tor's not.
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:39:59.960]   I really don't know.
[00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:01.760]   - No, I know, but you have to wonder about anything.
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.640]   It seems to me that if you're doing something,
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:05.680]   I mean, you're best bad if you want to do this kind
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:07.760]   of stuff and I'm not recommending it to anyone,
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:12.760]   but get a big giant antenna and then some wireless
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:16.960]   spoof your Mac and link into some guy in the office.
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:17.800]   - Let him take the phone.
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:19.120]   - Pretend to be him.
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:20.560]   I mean, there's nothing else you can do.
[00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:22.640]   - I mean, none of us are saying child porn
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:24.880]   is a good thing and then with a child porn is terrible
[00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.360]   and these people should be tracked down.
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:29.640]   But you can track them down using old-fashioned techniques
[00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:31.920]   called, you know, you have somebody, you know,
[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:34.880]   kind of get into the ring and then find out who everybody is
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:37.600]   and it takes a while, takes some actual work.
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:38.920]   And then you bust them all.
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:40.400]   I mean, they've done this over and over again.
[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:41.640]   It's not that hard to do.
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:45.080]   - Yeah, so I guess the moral is for those using
[00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:49.400]   Tor servers for legitimate, you know, privacy reasons
[00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:51.680]   might start to consider whether,
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:53.800]   how private is it after all?
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:54.720]   - Well, how does it work?
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:55.560]   I mean, what do you do?
[00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:56.400]   How do you find one?
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:59.000]   If you wanted to use a Tor, it's called a Tor server.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.240]   - The onion router, it's tor.eff.org
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:04.680]   and the idea is you'll run a little program
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:07.080]   that will automatically, a little proxy program
[00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:11.840]   that will automatically hand off your traffic through servers
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:14.800]   and a number of servers, randomized servers,
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:17.680]   all over the planet.
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:22.160]   So the theory is that if you do enough switchbacks.
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:23.720]   - So how does somebody track this?
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:25.400]   It doesn't, it sounds like a nightmare.
[00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:28.240]   - The only way to do it is if you had the logs
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:31.040]   of enough Tor servers, you could piece it together.
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:32.840]   - Yeah, but it would sound a lot.
[00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:34.000]   - You'd have to have a lot of those
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.480]   and it couldn't be a break in the chain.
[00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:37.920]   - Right, it seemed to me.
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:39.000]   - Yeah, I mean, this is basically
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.120]   then the zero knowledge folks,
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:43.320]   when they were still doing it,
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:44.320]   before they shut the servers,
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:45.560]   they actually couldn't make any money off it.
[00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:49.000]   What they had was hundreds of servers connected out
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.280]   on the web in various countries.
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:54.200]   And you would use it basically an anonymous token
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:41:57.640]   to purchase an ID.
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:58.640]   They would use that ID,
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:41:59.560]   which couldn't be connected to you
[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:02.080]   by any financial purchase of any sort.
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:04.880]   And you would log into a local server.
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:08.160]   And then the way they had it set up was so that your request,
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:11.680]   your IP request, your HTTP request would bounce through
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:13.360]   as many countries, like basically,
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:15.640]   if you were in the US, it would bounce you to like Sweden
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:18.160]   and then Holland and then, you know, to like Mexico.
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:19.720]   And then what they would do is they would bounce it
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:21.600]   through a bunch of European countries
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:24.040]   with really extreme privacy laws
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:26.520]   to make it as difficult as possible to chain it down.
[00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:30.080]   And even if somebody did manage to go through the years
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:31.800]   and years of court battles,
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:35.120]   they would take to track down the ID.
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:38.240]   They still wouldn't actually be able to rig the ID up
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:40.880]   with somebody, unless they happen to, you know,
[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:44.720]   nab you and your computer and your ID at the time.
[00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:47.080]   - It's either prosecutors that don't really understand tour
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:50.120]   or it's somebody trying to send a chilling effect,
[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:51.680]   a message.
[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:52.920]   - Yeah.
[00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:53.880]   I mean, it's an interesting side.
[00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:55.560]   This gets back to the whole argument like me,
[00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:57.440]   and well, nobody really needs privacy
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:59.280]   if they're not doing something wrong.
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:00.440]   - That's, well, I mean,
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:02.240]   a lot of what the tour is about
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:04.040]   is just protecting your privacy on websites.
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:05.120]   You know, people, you know,
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:06.640]   with network analysis and so forth,
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:08.640]   I mean, people can really kind of draw a pretty big,
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:10.640]   pretty good picture of what you're up to.
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:11.480]   - Yeah.
[00:43:11.480 --> 00:43:13.080]   - And I'm more and more about marketers than I am
[00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:13.920]   about government.
[00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:14.840]   - Well, there's a market, yeah,
[00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:16.760]   but there's all kinds of worries out there about privacy.
[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:19.280]   I mean, do you stalkers, people want to kill you?
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:20.120]   - You bet.
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:22.440]   - I mean, somebody wants to make sure
[00:43:22.440 --> 00:43:24.920]   you vote Republican or Democrat.
[00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:27.640]   I mean, there's a million things that they can do
[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:28.680]   with this kind of information.
[00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:31.120]   It's gotten really, when you look at it,
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:33.400]   it's got little to do with whether you're doing something
[00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:36.720]   wrong or not in these porn maniacs,
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:38.360]   sickos or whatever you want to call them.
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:40.680]   I mean, it's pretty small group that, you know,
[00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:43.400]   they target sure, but I mean, it's everybody's susceptible
[00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:46.720]   to being, you know, kind of spied upon
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:49.280]   in ways that aren't necessarily positive for a person.
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:50.480]   You know, I've always said this that, you know,
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:51.800]   if people want to say, well,
[00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:52.760]   if you're not doing something wrong,
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:53.800]   what about this situation?
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:55.400]   You're working for company A,
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:57.000]   and you want to go work for company B,
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.280]   so you have a couple of meetings,
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:43:59.920]   but these things, you know, or somewhere,
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:01.920]   you can be tracked and find out that
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:02.920]   you're going to have these meetings.
[00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:04.800]   You may or may not get that job,
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:06.280]   but if you don't get the job and company A
[00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:08.040]   finds out about it, you're toast.
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:10.200]   I mean, this is not doing anything wrong.
[00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:11.720]   I'm just looking for a job.
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:13.240]   How's that doing anything wrong?
[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:14.680]   It's like, you know, but meanwhile,
[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:16.120]   of course, you're never going to get promoted again,
[00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:18.400]   and your life is ruined, perhaps.
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:20.120]   But that's the kind of thing that goes on,
[00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:22.360]   and if all the companies that do these sorts of things,
[00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:25.320]   high tech companies are really into spying on their employees.
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:28.200]   Well, you shouldn't be using our internet connection
[00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:31.000]   at the office to do your job hunting, John.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.680]   That's just your backbone of your organization.
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:37.280]   In general, since you could also track people's home stuff,
[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:38.120]   and who knows what that is.
[00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:39.000]   Whistle blowers.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.560]   There's lots of reasons why anonymity is an important part of it.
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:45.320]   Using the connection at the office to look for a job,
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:47.880]   but the fact of the matter is if everything's going to be wide open
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:50.520]   and it can track anything you're doing and nobody cares,
[00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:52.280]   then where are you going to do it then?
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:53.280]   You can't do it at home.
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:54.280]   You can't do it anywhere.
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:55.960]   You have to have their private meetings,
[00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:57.640]   and those can be back-dored.
[00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:01.000]   I mean, right now, one of the restaurant reservation systems,
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:06.200]   supposedly, has a back door, and people can put two and two together.
[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:08.120]   And then your insurance rates are going up.
[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:10.440]   One, two, many cream sauces.
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:11.480]   That's-- you got that.
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:12.360]   There's another problem.
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:13.600]   There's a problem right there.
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:14.640]   I've got to be careful.
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:17.240]   You know, actually, there is an insurance angle on all this stuff.
[00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:20.560]   I've always felt that way about the Safeway Club card.
[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:21.280]   Yeah, I never know.
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:21.800]   That sucker.
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:24.000]   But they don't want you so much more for your food.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:24.680]   No, you don't.
[00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:26.840]   You just tell them to use the house card.
[00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:27.840]   Oh, you can do that.
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:29.720]   You do that in any store in the country.
[00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:30.880]   I've done it everywhere.
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:31.920]   You don't have your card.
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:33.240]   You say, I forgot my card.
[00:45:33.240 --> 00:45:34.320]   Can you use the house card?
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:36.840]   And they always have a card right there by the cash register,
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:39.000]   and they'll be glad to swipe it in or the person who finds you.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.080]   Oh, they just type in their own number.
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:40.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:41.080]   Yeah, really.
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:42.000]   Absolutely.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.480]   Oh, you're surprised you didn't know that.
[00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:45.400]   Well, we have learned something on this podcast.
[00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:45.800]   Use the house card.
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:47.080]   It makes it worth listening.
[00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:49.680]   Use how that is fantastic.
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:51.440]   Yeah, so that whole thing is a scam.
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:52.040]   Oh, my God.
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:53.600]   Well, it's obvious what they're up to,
[00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:54.440]   and I don't do it.
[00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:58.120]   But it's kind of depressing when you look at the Safeway price.
[00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:01.320]   The club card price is $4, and if you're not a member,
[00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:03.520]   it's $9, it's like, well, what are they?
[00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:04.640]   I mean, they're basically they're trying
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:06.400]   to track people's buying habits, right?
[00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:06.920]   This is--
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:07.720]   And then they issue--
[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:10.120]   What's so nefarious about that?
[00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:11.720]   Well, nothing unless you're eating hummus.
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:12.200]   Nothing.
[00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:12.960]   Yeah, I catch your ass.
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:15.160]   What if they take that information
[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:16.840]   and then give it to the insurance companies?
[00:46:16.840 --> 00:46:17.960]   Well, that's the reason--
[00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:21.120]   As far as we're not doing that, as soon as they start doing that--
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:22.360]   How do you know they're not doing it?
[00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:25.360]   They start fine tuning and, well, how come your rates went up?
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:26.320]   Well, I don't know.
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:28.360]   Well, we've done some research and whatever.
[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:29.720]   I mean, this information, they're not
[00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:31.360]   just doing it for their own benefit.
[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:33.000]   I used to be in the mailing list business,
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.280]   and I'm telling you what you want to do
[00:46:34.280 --> 00:46:36.880]   is you collect this data because you can sell it.
[00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:37.360]   Wait, wait, wait.
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:38.920]   You used to be in the mailing list business?
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:40.600]   Yeah, we're in the spam business.
[00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:41.440]   Is this the real reason--
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:42.440]   No, I wish.
[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:43.880]   --you didn't be here.
[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:46.200]   No, I'd be in Monaco.
[00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:47.080]   I got those friends.
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:48.600]   I got their friends in the business.
[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:49.840]   When were you in the mailing list business?
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:51.600]   I didn't know I was in the mailing list business in the late
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:53.960]   70s when I was selling software.
[00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:54.680]   One of the side--
[00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:56.560]   one of your make most of your money off the mailing list
[00:46:56.560 --> 00:46:57.120]   business.
[00:46:57.120 --> 00:46:59.240]   When you see that computer professor that
[00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:02.040]   got us on TV all the time, he's not
[00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:03.920]   in the computer learning business.
[00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:05.480]   Oh, the video professor?
[00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:07.280]   He's in the mailing list business.
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:09.320]   That's why he will give you money.
[00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:11.160]   It's a profit thing.
[00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:14.560]   These numbers-- the way it is for high tech numbers
[00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:15.560]   in the mailing list business--
[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:16.840]   I don't know what they are currently
[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:18.680]   because I haven't kept up, but I'll tell you this.
[00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:21.360]   When he's offering to give you your money back,
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:26.040]   plus $5 or $10 cash if you're unsatisfied,
[00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:29.520]   that means he's making a lot of money from your name.
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:30.520]   That's a lot.
[00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:32.480]   It's like one of the most valuable mailing
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:35.040]   lists in the world used to be here in the United States.
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:37.240]   Used to be the one for this nose hair clipper
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:39.800]   that they would sell in the back of men's magazines
[00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:41.440]   or rolling stone and stuff.
[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:43.520]   And you laugh, but anybody that is so timid,
[00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:46.040]   they won't buy a nose hair clipper at the local--
[00:47:46.040 --> 00:47:46.540]   Oh.
[00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:47.280]   --and the local drugstore.
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:49.840]   That used to be one of the grails of mailing lists.
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:51.760]   Because you'd buy everything by mail order.
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:52.680]   By every.
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:53.440]   That's probably true.
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:54.960]   If you'd buy a nose hair clipper mail
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:56.560]   or you'd buy anything mail--
[00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:58.640]   No, it's not even about-- no, because there's--
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:01.520]   don't diss the nose hair clipper.
[00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:03.320]   It's actually about somebody who's
[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:05.760]   like that self-conscious, but won't actually
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:07.840]   buy the stuff in public is what it's about.
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:08.520]   Well, that's what I'm saying.
[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:09.520]   Yeah, the buy a lot of mail orders.
[00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:10.320]   Yeah, it's what they're saying.
[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:10.320]   Yeah.
[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:10.640]   Right.
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:12.880]   It's going to do a lot of reticent buying.
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:14.320]   But I got a question.
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:15.520]   Is it still valuable?
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:17.320]   I mean, doesn't everybody just throw out this junk?
[00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:19.320]   I mean, we're talking about mail, US mail, junk mail
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:21.320]   that you get in your post office box.
[00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:22.880]   It's not what it used to be, I can say.
[00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:24.120]   But I'll tell you this.
[00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:28.640]   If that guy is offering to give you five or $10 plus,
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:29.440]   so your money back--
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:30.600]   That's obviously somebody's giving him money.
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:31.640]   And shipping.
[00:48:31.640 --> 00:48:35.120]   That name has to be worth-- and the total cost of that whole deal
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:36.280]   has got to be around $20.
[00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:38.720]   That means the name itself is worth about $20.
[00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:40.920]   Or $40 or $50 or $100.
[00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:43.400]   I mean, it's minimum 20 is what I'm saying.
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:47.240]   And in other words, you can sell that list over or rented.
[00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:48.520]   It's a list of rental.
[00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:49.360]   You don't sell these lists.
[00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:50.640]   You know, I have a post office box.
[00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:53.520]   And right next to the post office boxes is a big--
[00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:55.520]   I mean, big giant recycling bin.
[00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:57.440]   And I watch people at the post office box.
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:58.960]   The first thing they do, they open the thing.
[00:48:58.960 --> 00:48:59.520]   They take it out.
[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:01.160]   And there's tons of junk mail in there.
[00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:02.120]   They immediately go.
[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:04.920]   They sort through it, throw everything in the bin.
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:08.040]   The postal service might as well just recycle it back into the boxes.
[00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:09.920]   Nobody even looks at that stuff.
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:13.360]   I do a lot of stuff out the same way.
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:15.680]   It's not assuming the mailing list is--
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:18.160]   or I'm sorry, the direct marketing business mail order.
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:20.920]   It doesn't assume that every single person keeps it.
[00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:23.720]   You only need to sell 2% of the toll.
[00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:25.200]   So you have 100%--
[00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:26.480]   Is that the figure?
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:27.960]   That's the break even number.
[00:49:27.960 --> 00:49:29.120]   You have 2%.
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:34.600]   And so too, so you need to sell two people out of 100 on the proposition.
[00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:35.720]   And then you're in business.
[00:49:35.720 --> 00:49:36.760]   And so--
[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:41.640]   Patrick, do you ever get the feeling that there's this whole hidden secret agenda
[00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:44.080]   that's going on in life and that you just--
[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:46.400]   I feel like I know nothing about life.
[00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:47.880]   All of this stuff is--
[00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:50.600]   People like John are like going, yeah, I know what's really going on.
[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:52.440]   I'm missing the whole point of it.
[00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:54.160]   It isn't the whole point, first of all.
[00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:55.640]   And second of all, I hope not.
[00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:57.960]   John's saying here is news to me.
[00:49:57.960 --> 00:49:59.760]   It's a subtext.
[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:00.880]   And you're missing the subtext.
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:02.360]   I'm missing the subtext.
[00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:03.560]   You're missing the subtext.
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:04.840]   You're not missing the point of life.
[00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:07.640]   You're missing the subtext, which is where all the money is, by the way.
[00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:08.560]   That's what I mean.
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:10.000]   I'm missing the money.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:14.320]   Here I am trying to tell people to go to the Dell commercials on the website.
[00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:17.920]   And meanwhile, I should be selling their mailing list or something.
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:18.520]   Well, yeah.
[00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:20.320]   But it depends on--
[00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:22.800]   I've been trying to get you into this for years, Leo.
[00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:24.840]   I'm such a fool.
[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:31.920]   I got to tell you, Leo had this huge list at Tech TV that was just this enormous thing
[00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:32.480]   he collected.
[00:50:32.480 --> 00:50:33.800]   He's managed to do this over the years.
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:34.920]   And I'm always thinking about this--
[00:50:34.920 --> 00:50:36.560]   I got about 20 gold money.
[00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:38.800]   I mean, I know what these things are worth.
[00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:40.320]   I mean, they're worth the like--
[00:50:40.320 --> 00:50:41.600]   I didn't know there was--
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:45.640]   I was always thinking 10 bucks used to be an old number for like, what's a name worth?
[00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:47.480]   In terms of what you could get out of it.
[00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:50.280]   You can get compensated about 10 bucks per name over time.
[00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:53.680]   And that's why they talked about eyeballs and all these things during the dot com here.
[00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:55.040]   It was all about that.
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:59.240]   But I think if this guy's giving away-- this video professor's giving away 10 bucks plus
[00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:03.480]   all those expense-- all the discs and everything else, I mean, it's got have gone beyond 10
[00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:04.480]   bucks.
[00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:05.480]   It must be close to 20 bucks.
[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:10.120]   And I've heard that $20 is what a cable subscriber's worth or maybe $25.
[00:51:10.120 --> 00:51:12.200]   And I've heard numbers like 30, 40, 50.
[00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:13.200]   I've thought it's--
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:14.880]   I thought people were smarter now.
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:17.480]   I just didn't think people really paid any attention to John.
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:18.480]   We certainly throw spam at it.
[00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:19.480]   It's only a small percentage.
[00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:22.680]   That's the problem is John said it twice.
[00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:25.200]   It's not about the small number.
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:26.440]   It's about the small number.
[00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:29.280]   That's why spam is so popular.
[00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:34.440]   We do thank the folks at Dell for providing us with the wherewithal to get my nose waxed
[00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:40.880]   and whatever else Patrick wants to do for his kiltage.
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:45.240]   Dell actually has a great deal for a back to school computer that I mentioned B110.
[00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:50.520]   We've got a link at the Leo's Pics page on twit.tv and also the Inspiron.
[00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:52.240]   Is it Inspiron or Inspiron?
[00:51:52.240 --> 00:51:53.240]   Inspiron.
[00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:54.240]   Inspiron.
[00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:55.240]   Is it?
[00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:56.240]   You sure?
[00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:57.240]   Well, does anybody know?
[00:51:57.240 --> 00:51:58.240]   I've never heard of this.
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:51:59.240]   Well, I covered notebooks for a bunch of years.
[00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:00.240]   And if every Dell employee and for--
[00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:02.240]   Okay, in-sell with all the Inspiron.
[00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:08.120]   Inspiron, the E1405, big, wide screen, very light, very nice in all the specs you want,
[00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:09.640]   including the Core 2 Duo.
[00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:14.520]   But for prices, you must go to twit.tv/dell.
[00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:15.600]   That's the Leo Pics page.
[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:17.960]   And thank you, Dell, for your support.
[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:20.840]   But you're not on anymore on my list.
[00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:22.560]   I'm not on your list anymore?
[00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:26.000]   Dude, you're soft list.
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:27.840]   Is this the good list of the bad list?
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:32.000]   Remember John used to be on Microsoft's enemy list.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.080]   Now, you're not up to ever was.
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:38.440]   You weren't-- because you were saying Balmer had a blackboard in his office with the journalists
[00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:40.680]   that were bad people.
[00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:45.040]   He was a PR guy that worked there named Marty Tucker.
[00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:46.040]   Oh, Marty Tucker.
[00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:49.720]   And he was enamored with the Nixon administration.
[00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:50.720]   Seriously.
[00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:54.960]   He didn't make any less funny.
[00:52:54.960 --> 00:53:00.120]   And he had a big board in his office.
[00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:02.520]   Now, I have to say that this is second.
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:05.760]   It was one of the guys from the New York Times that told me this.
[00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:06.760]   And people have confirmed it.
[00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:08.920]   He had a big--
[00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:09.920]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:53:09.920 --> 00:53:11.000]   I know who could confirm this.
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   And I see him right now.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:17.520]   He's on Skype, Bill McCrone, former editor in chief of PC Magazine.
[00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:19.360]   Well, let's just-- let's conference him in.
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:20.520]   Hey, Bill.
[00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:21.720]   Hey, guys.
[00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:23.800]   You can confirm or deny this.
[00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:26.240]   Do you ever hear this Marty Tucker story?
[00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:31.720]   As a matter of fact, I pushed my way into his office against his attempts
[00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:34.640]   to keep me out to get a free t-shirt.
[00:53:34.640 --> 00:53:42.280]   And I saw the three boards that were marked OK, needs work, and d--
[00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:42.800]   [BEEP]
[00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:44.280]   Oh, really?
[00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:44.760]   Yes.
[00:53:44.760 --> 00:53:46.160]   So at St. John, this is perfect.
[00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:48.200]   We have confirmation.
[00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:48.720]   Yeah.
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:50.560]   Well, I mean, most of my stories are accurate.
[00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:51.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:54.160]   I feel like this is the moment in Manhattan.
[00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:58.280]   You know where Woody Allen pulls Marshall McLuhan out of the airline.
[00:53:58.280 --> 00:53:59.720]   He says, well, no, actually.
[00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:00.720]   Let me--
[00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:01.720]   Well, I got Mill McCrone.
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:02.220]   It's not Marshall.
[00:54:02.220 --> 00:54:02.880]   So Bill, thank you.
[00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:04.120]   It says we got Mill on.
[00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:06.560]   Let me ask you, since I have never seen the board, I only heard about.
[00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:08.560]   Did you get to check out any of the names on there?
[00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:09.080]   Yeah, who was on there?
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:10.160]   Yeah, sure.
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:11.400]   Well, let's see.
[00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:15.920]   PC Magazine itself was on the OK list.
[00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:19.480]   And I told Marty that if that was the case, we had a problem.
[00:54:19.480 --> 00:54:22.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:25.000]   If you're a real journalist, you don't want to be on the OK list.
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.440]   Exactly.
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:30.160]   Let's see, Dvorak was on the needs work list.
[00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:34.440]   And the infamous Will Zachman was on the deep list.
[00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:35.240]   Oh, this is right.
[00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:36.240]   Does Zachman--
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:39.320]   Zachman used to just hound Microsoft to--
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:42.840]   24-- every column was just the same basic column
[00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:44.840]   about how screwed up Microsoft was.
[00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:46.640]   And so I guess that was the way we'd end up.
[00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:50.960]   Did you see anybody else on the needs work list?
[00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:54.520]   The list had probably half a dozen names on it.
[00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:57.440]   And I could not tell you anymore.
[00:54:57.440 --> 00:55:00.280]   John, you're gratifying though to know that you needed work.
[00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:01.240]   I'm sure that's a very gratifying--
[00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:01.800]   I need to work.
[00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:03.160]   But I always need work.
[00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:04.720]   Anyone has to work for me.
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:06.120]   I'm looking for jobs.
[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:08.520]   So Marty had that right.
[00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:09.200]   I always need to work.
[00:55:09.200 --> 00:55:10.480]   Maybe that's what I meant.
[00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:10.960]   All right, Bill.
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:11.600]   Hey, thank you.
[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:12.720]   And we'll see you next week.
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:17.640]   We're glad to have your confirmation on that story.
[00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:18.640]   Well, it was my pleasure.
[00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:19.880]   Take care.
[00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:20.920]   It's been nice talking to you.
[00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:23.320]   You guys are insane here.
[00:55:23.320 --> 00:55:25.480]   Hey, I was going to bring up one story real quickly.
[00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:30.400]   But I'll save it for our Mac Break Weekly podcast on Tuesday.
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:35.240]   And that is a pretty major hack on the Mac side--
[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:38.080]   an installer hack that allows you to get absolute access,
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:39.960]   basically root the Mac system.
[00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:42.040]   So we'll talk about that on Tuesday.
[00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:43.960]   We're also very pleased to announce
[00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:46.320]   that Twitch's going to be launching a VISTA podcast
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:47.080]   with Paul Therat.
[00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:49.600]   That'll be starting on Friday.
[00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:53.720]   So make sure you tune in Twitch.tv.
[00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:55.520]   Bill McCrone, John C. de Boric.
[00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:58.240]   Taptic Norton, thank you for being here.
[00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:01.960]   I'll let you guys continue to talk while I hang up on you.
[00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:03.080]   I love you, Twitch.
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:04.000]   It's in the can.
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.000]   [LAUGHTER]
