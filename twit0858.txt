[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.420]   He found some really goofy stuff. Why E3 is not going to happen and will it ever happen

[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.360]   I've hand assembled, cobbled together with my own, no, Jesse doesn't. I know I have nothing
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.560]   to do with it. But I'm very pleased with our panel this week. Rich D'Amuro is here from

[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:11.600]   Thank you for joining us. Also Christina Warren, Senior Cloud Advocate for Microsoft, film girl.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:20.760]   She's got the tags on her... Animal Crossing dolls? Yes. I'm not going to take the tags
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:27.480]   off. Well wait, the top one is the woman at the front desk. It's Isabelle and Tom Nook.
[00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:35.120]   Is that Tom Nook? No, no, no, no. This is the GitHub. That's the GitHub Squid. That's
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:42.400]   cool. I didn't know you could get that. Yeah, yeah, this is Mona. Mona is her name.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.960]   Mona is her name. So she's got Isabelle Mona. Where's Tom? I don't see Tom. Oh, Tom is
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:53.760]   behind the package. Tom is behind Patrick Bateman. Wait a minute. What do they call
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.640]   those ones with the big heads? The Nookies, what are they? There's a name for those.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.280]   Uncle Pop, Inko Winka. It was the Funko Pop. Funko Pop. Funko Pop. Funko Pop. And this
[00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:08.280]   is literally Patrick Bateman from American Psycho. That's a little weird. It is a little
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:19.160]   weird, right? But it's great. I'm a fan. Okay. Leo's like, I don't know what to do with this.
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.600]   And I'm like, it's satire. It's funny. And then like to have a lot of commerce based
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.120]   on kind of an anti-commerce book. Perfect. People misunderstood. It is great. Absolutely.
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.640]   It is your generation is so ironic that it just fits in with all the other irony, right?
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.360]   Also back on our mics for we have a senior in ages. It's so great to see Ashley is get
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:43.520]   the from CNET. And look at those two tellies over your shoulder there. That's congratulations
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.720]   on those. Oh, thank you. Thank you. I'm now an award winning producer. Yes.
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.160]   I think I agree with Christina. There's nothing quite like the juxtaposition of animal crossing
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:05:00.520]   and murder and Funko Pop and psychos. Yeah. Yeah. Sweet murder. Look, I argue Tom Nook kind
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.240]   of there's an overlap there. Look, I agree. I agree. No, look, he's got some shady stuff
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.600]   going on. Like we haven't really. You know, there is something buried in the back there
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:17.680]   in 100% 100% some villagers have in fact had their legs broken for not paying back. Okay.
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.760]   So how many of you are still playing animal crossing now that the pandemic is over? Oh,
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:29.160]   wait, I'm sorry. The pandemic's over. Oh, I forgot. I forgot. Okay. Rich and rich. By
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:33.360]   the way, one of the reasons rich is in Desi Luz Studios is because he's actually in a COVID
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:39.200]   bubble. I'm in the middle of the pandemic. Like literally I am like round zero for the
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:44.160]   pandemic right now. And somehow I've avoided it. I don't know how congratulations, but
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:50.320]   I went to CES last week avoided there coming come home to my kid who has it. And immediately
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:57.680]   everyone here gets it except me for the last week. So did your son go to CES? Apparently,
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:01.680]   as far as I can tell, nobody got it from CES. It was a safest CES in years because everyone
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.120]   was so far. It was terrifying. It was like, it was like, it showed up. That's why for what
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:11.360]   they said 40,000 people, which is a quarter of the normal, right? Yeah. And so it's not
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.080]   the people were there. It was mostly the exhibits that were to me the most impacted. So I mean,
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:21.120]   obviously the floor was easier to kind of navigate, but it seemed like the exhibits were, you know,
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.680]   or I don't know what you call them, the, you know, the, the exhibits. Yeah, they were definitely
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:30.200]   all the bit, but I will say for my purposes, it was fantastic because all the stuff that
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.960]   I got, nobody else got. And so my videos were great. We got a couple videos that went viral.
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.240]   And it was, I thought it was a fantastic trip. So I'm hoping that everyone stays away from
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:45.400]   CES. I can see a video of you from CES doing something a little odd. Oh, I can't remember
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:50.000]   what it was. I just thought, Oh, there he goes again. No, what I really thought was the
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.680]   great thing about CES this year was you could get those shots. You could go in and you know,
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:58.400]   ride the snake or whatever. I can't remember what were you doing. Tell me about it. I mean,
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.600]   literally it was, it was so easy because there was no, you know, usually you'd have to go
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.440]   to like, they're like, excuse me, talk to the press people. You know, you got to get
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.400]   in early. I didn't do any meeting set up. Nothing. They're like, how do you want to tour a booth
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.160]   early? I'm like, no, I'll just tour it on the first day. No problem. Was there any
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.720]   sounds like the greatest CES experience if I'm being honest, but it doesn't work. That's
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.800]   the problem. It doesn't work that way. You know what I mean? Like if they did that every
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:24.280]   year, it would be hard. It would be it would be chaos. No, you can't do it that way. But
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.960]   it that literally sounds like it just reminds me of the old, the convention days of your
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:34.120]   where it was like very small before these things became these massive, like, right consumer
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:42.080]   driven. Like I just remember E3 and like the year 2000, like the year after the Dreamcast
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.400]   came out, or maybe it was 99. Maybe it was the year the Dreamcast came out. I just remember
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:51.560]   it was like so small. Kencha Hall was still real. Kencha Hall. Those were the days. Yeah.
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.520]   Yeah. It was like, I just remember that I will never forget that floor layout. They
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:00.880]   literally had, they had all kinds of crazy stuff going on there. Like Tecmo had a whole
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:05.360]   thing with like the girls from Dead or Alive and like they had just like all these models
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:10.480]   and they're all dressed up in all the costume. Like and it was insane. Like I mean, it was
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:15.520]   really just pure. It was the pure distillation of what E3 is. You must have been like 12.
[00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:20.920]   Yeah. Oh no. I was so I was definitely not old enough to attend the show. We lied. Like
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:25.760]   me and my friend just lied, which is why they got in. Dreamcast. I like it. I can't even
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:30.840]   believe you were born when the Dreamcast came out. I think I was a see. I was a see. I
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:36.800]   was 99. I was 16. Yeah. 16. Yeah. I wasn't sure. I have being allowed to go. But yeah,
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:40.840]   my friends who were just they were they were a little older and we literally just made
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:47.320]   up a company. We were like, Oh yeah, we're a independent video game shop out in California.
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:52.280]   Yeah. And that was when no one cared. No one cared. So I was going to. I did the same thing.
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:57.720]   We were the same age and I just like not not not in California, but it was in Atlanta and
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:05.840]   like the 90, 70, 98. Yeah. And I stole like I like made fake business cards and yeah,
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:12.120]   we did too. That's how we got it. That's how you guys look at the types of personalities
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.840]   you guys are and look how successful you are. This is what you have to do. This is just
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:20.400]   a couple of past or basements over here. I remember when Alexander Graham Bell introduced
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:25.880]   the telephone. I'll never forget that. The world fair. You were underage. You have to
[00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:30.720]   tell the world fair. Yeah, it was amazing. Yeah. When you think about what we were lying
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:34.360]   about like to do, like we were to go to a trade event, right? Like like we wanted to
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:38.800]   see cool stuff, but like, you know, like the dumbest thing like not not my head like,
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:44.560]   you know, fake ID not to get into clubs, but to go to three to go to three. Well, that's
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:48.600]   the first thing I get to games before they came out. That was my that was my one goal.
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:53.560]   I was like, I just want to try and mute. I did have a fake ID to get into clubs as well.
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:58.200]   I will say that. Oh, no, I said I didn't. I was lame. I was super lame. Yeah, I totally
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:03.000]   I was only playing video games all the time. Very sad. Still do. In fact, I'm now almost
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.120]   40 and I just do that too. So Rich, what was your favorite at CES? Was it the was the amazing
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:14.960]   color changing car, the world's smallest dishwasher, the massage robot? What exactly? What exactly?
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:22.440]   So there are so many. I think the it's funny. The video that went the most viral is the I
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:26.400]   didn't put it on my Instagram, but I put out my Facebook and it's the look at the new mail
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:31.560]   truck. So this thing, I don't know if it got posted. It's like some mail carrier association,
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:36.720]   like for the UPS approved this thing. It's a beautiful thing. Is it the one with the big
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:41.160]   windows in front and all that? But the strange? Yeah, that's enough. Yeah, it looks like a
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:46.760]   Pixar truck. Yeah. Yeah. That's the new the mail truck. I think that's a that's a very
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:52.400]   cool. So that is done like over I think it's up to 1.2 million views on my face.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:58.360]   Book page and it's like people are just debating whether the truck, you know, it looks like
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.920]   it was just, you know, if it's going to work, if it's going to be able to navigate no sleep,
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:06.400]   what do they say? They're going to buy like a like a hundred thousand of these or something.
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:10.280]   I mean, I think I'm committed to that even more and it's like 10% of them are going to
[00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:15.800]   be electric. Yeah. So that's another side. But it's also been about 30 years since they
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:20.160]   upgraded these trucks, which is pretty wild time. I'm sure there are all polluters and
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:28.240]   all of that. But I guess my point is that it's kind of gimmicky these days CES, right?
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:32.720]   I mean, it's all a little bit of a gimmicky, like the world's smallest dishwasher. I'm
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:37.720]   sure they'll make that. But who the hell cares? Oh my gosh, so many people care. I'm
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:43.280]   not kidding. This is this is what I love about this. I got so many people emailing me
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:47.400]   about I guess I'm out of touch. I don't this is what I'm saying. Like I love CES so much
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:51.240]   because it's a it's a I don't care about the big installations. You know what I mean? Like
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:56.200]   the giant stuff that means nothing. It's the little things that I discover like this dishwasher
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:01.440]   and like all these other little things that you can wash five dishes in this. Who wants
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:05.960]   this? You live in a giant mansion. There are so many people that live in tiny little
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:11.000]   apartments that don't have a dishwasher. If you have five dishes to wash, you can wash
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.160]   them in 30 seconds in the sink. You don't need a dishwashing machine. When you have
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:20.920]   an apartment that does not have a dishwasher, your only goal in life is to have a dishwasher.
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:24.280]   I believe I've been there. I'm guessing I'm out of touch. It's a nightmare to not have
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:29.040]   a dishwasher. I'm here. I I got to say, Leah, I agree 100% with rich. Like the best part
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:34.240]   of CES is finding all the weird weird stuff on the show. That's what I hate about CES.
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:39.240]   The stuff that's there you can't buy. You maybe you could buy it in a year. Most likely
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:43.400]   you can't every time you do CES coverage, you have to say, well, if you're responsible,
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:48.000]   you say this is never going to you never going to see a color changing car from BMW. Enjoy.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:54.280]   No, but this is goofy because you know, so weird thing. Yeah. But see that's not happening
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:59.880]   that people love that. I know. Well, that's the only good part because the rest of it,
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:03.880]   like it's just the it's basically just been press conferences and like the companies that
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:07.160]   know that they can get your attention will just have their own separate events anyway,
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:10.920]   which is what they've all done. Yeah, that's true. They don't need to. Yes. They don't
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:14.920]   need CES, right? So like Sam, like when all the big, you know, people start like pulling
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:20.160]   out of CES, like it made the show different and it made it worse in some ways. But then
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.600]   like I think that the beauty of it was like, okay, well, now we can just focus on the really
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:29.320]   weird stuff that you might not ever see or maybe you will, but like this is why else are
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.920]   you going to show up at this? Why else are you going to spend five days in Las Vegas
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:36.560]   if you don't have to unless you can look at the really weird stuff? I don't know.
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:42.400]   Okay. I guess. I mean, if you if somebody hit you in this BMW, what's cool is the ink
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:47.680]   display would actually show where you got hit. There'd be a nice, he'd splat. It would
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:51.680]   all be like that. Like when you break like an LCD screen, you know, it's all like, yeah,
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:56.040]   stuff. Yeah. Like just what you want to hit that. Yeah. But this car, they said number
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.240]   one that there will be color changing cars in the future. I know that's just black and
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:03.400]   white right now, but it can only do. Well, he can only do. Great scale. So that's all
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:10.400]   it can do for now. Yeah. For now, for now, but someday, I dream of a day that all mankind
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:15.120]   will have color changing cars in color. That will be here's. Okay. Here's a couple of real
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:19.120]   world examples. Okay. Let's say you now. Here's where it gets kind of weird. Like if you're
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:23.240]   driving dominoes on the weekend, right? You know, those little things on the top. So you
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:29.000]   could have your car say dominoes on the side. Now it wouldn't be a BMW perhaps. It would
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.960]   be so I got a magnetic line when I have to drive over driver. I just put the magnet on
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:40.000]   the top or I put the Uber in the window. I mean, yeah. Oh, future you won't have to
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.720]   in the future. You're autonomous. Okay. So here's another example. So you have an autonomous
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:49.240]   vehicle system in like a metropolitan city. You know why they're going to do this? It
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:54.960]   has your name on it. No, no, no, just get it ads. It's all about putting ads. Absolutely.
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:58.920]   What if you could have ads on your car? A company comes out and says, Hey, we'll pay
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:04.080]   you for the ads that we put on your car. It's called a wreck. I know it never works. But
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:07.560]   it's never been to scale because it's so expensive. But if your car can display this
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:13.040]   on as a side note, you know, it can go from red to green, but it can also just add for
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:17.000]   how about this? This is the massage robot. Did you actually get a massage from this or
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   no, trained professionals are allowed to go under the wheels. I the people are worried
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.360]   about this girl's hair getting caught. Oh, yeah, I would be terrified of that.
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:31.160]   Would you imagine? And what if this thing went too hard and just literally cracked your
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:37.360]   bones? It seems like this is, I feel like the humans can do a pretty good job. I don't
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:42.320]   do we really need robots to do this? But again, here's I I'm an optimistic tech person. Imagine
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:47.280]   you're at a resort that you come off a long plane flight. And the last thing you want
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:51.400]   to do is sit there with someone, whatever, you go into this room, you pay that, you know,
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:56.280]   $10, whatever it is. And if you know, see it. Wait a minute. It's a $250,000 robot that's
[00:15:56.280 --> 00:16:00.840]   massaged you. So it's it's going to be installed at like a yeah, exactly. It'll be installed
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:05.200]   at like a resort. You know, it adapts your body by the way. If I'm not a resort, I want
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:09.320]   a real person. Yeah, I want a person. I'm sorry. Okay. But this could be at like a holiday
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:13.760]   and it's the worst. Okay. Well, here's okay. Here's the use case. I think I can I think
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:18.240]   I can argue is rich rich rich. Rich and I share an optimism of tech. Okay. So, okay,
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:22.120]   that's how you say use cases. Here's what I imagine the use cases. Yeah, we're tech
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:28.760]   optimists. Okay. So I imagine a world in which you can very cheaply once these are a little
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:33.440]   bit more common, easier to create. You can because one of the things that a lot of massage
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:38.220]   therapists experience when they're a long time career person is a lot of repetitive motion
[00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:42.840]   strain. And so it's hard. It's really hard on their body. I know it's very hard. I know
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:48.920]   that. And so I argue that the premium experience would be getting a massage from a human being
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:53.720]   and non premium would be like, hey, you spend 10 bucks, you get half an hour from this like
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:59.280]   robot. Yeah. So like massage chairs at the mall, right? Yeah, it's a massage experience.
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:00.560]   Yeah, very similar. Yeah.
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:05.320]   By the way, if your app is connected, you have like what you like, you know, so if you like
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:09.800]   to concentrate on the back to your legs or your back a certain way, it's all preprogrammed
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:14.000]   so that this follows you around whether you're getting massage in, you know, one state or
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.560]   another or one facility, it's all the same. So, Leo, we have seen you before. We will fix
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:23.480]   you. I was going to say, I was going to say on the one hand I like that like I would go
[00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:27.320]   into one of those, you know, what do they call them? The little express spots or whatever.
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:30.960]   I would like it. It would know, you know, I was like my shoulders worked on, but on the
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:34.720]   other hand, I'm also like, yeah, do I really want express spot to have all of my data?
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:39.240]   Look how empty. Look how empty the floor is at CES. Just.
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:44.720]   Very tiny, tiny. This is your report on KTLA. Hey, look, there's where our booth is normally.
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:49.920]   Yeah, normally see that. Yes. I was impressed. I did that in your homage, Ashley. I was
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:52.960]   looking for Bonnie Gannon. So this is one of the things that got a lot of attention.
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:56.960]   I'm sure she'd say hi. It's a robot with expressions. Amika, it's Amika.
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:18:05.480]   Amika, the talking robot. Is this real product or again, another kind of concept engine?
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:10.560]   I think I thought it was, I think there's a person behind the booth. They would not confirm
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:13.680]   that. Oh, you're kidding. It's not even real. It's fake.
[00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:16.320]   So it was a reason of us. So was it a positive?
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:20.960]   No way with the with the answers that they were giving, there is no way that. Oh, so she
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:25.480]   would ask her a question and she would talk to you. Oh, yeah. And it was impossible for
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:29.720]   us AI to come up with the answers that they came up with that quickly and that fluidly.
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:34.520]   Can I? I think the movement would you mind if I turn on your sound? I don't want to get
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:38.360]   in trouble with KTLA. Oh, I don't think they care. Okay.
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:43.240]   Let's tell the robot is very fluid in its movements and also its expression. Can you
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:48.640]   show us your range of motion? Absolutely. I would love it. Oh, that's a human. We're
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:56.640]   crying out loud. This is just, this is one of the things I really hate about C.S. A lot
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:03.160]   of people interested in you at the show this year. Humans are very fascinating in me. It
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:10.040]   is quite wonderful to see. I'm a can recognize expression. I like I like how she pretends
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:17.440]   to think for just a second. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let me process your question human. Oh, yeah.
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:22.600]   Well, let me overhear this through the latency, you know, of the microphone. Yeah, maybe there
[00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:26.520]   maybe she doesn't have to know that. I know that I know that there's an X prize for the
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:32.280]   for an avatar that could true human avatar a robot where you can control it remotely and
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:37.280]   like, you know, do there's like, I think five activities that require like chief to check
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:44.160]   all his boxes. And years ago, I got to control a robot like using a headset and like, I was
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.720]   having like shaking people's hands and stuff and that was very weird. And so I could see
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:52.240]   where that would be like this, but that seems very not transparent. Like they weren't just
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:56.280]   like, Oh, yeah, this is an avatar where you can like control a robot for remotely or whatever.
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:02.000]   I do have to ask you, Rich, did you go in the boring tunnel? I did. Yes. I this is
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:08.920]   what I'm saying. I Leo, when I say that Vegas was like an open playground, I did everything.
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:12.720]   There's nothing I didn't do. Yes, there was no line. There was no line. This was the best
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:18.080]   about the boring, the boring tunnel. Okay. So we go in there. I'm talking. We shot for
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:21.720]   like, we should explain. I'm sure everybody knows, but this is Elon Musk's boring company.
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:26.960]   They bore a hole. You may have heard of subways. No, this isn't quite like that. There's no
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:31.800]   escape route. There's no extra tunnel on the side. You're just driving Teslas down a hole
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:37.240]   underneath the Vegas center. Go ahead. Now you can explain how cool this was.
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:42.120]   So we so these are built 40 feet under the ground and they the idea was that this would
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:48.560]   be built all under Las Vegas. They started with just the south wing of the convention
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:53.400]   center to the all the way to the west wing. And so it's basically a 1.7 mile. It's two
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:57.160]   tunnels. And by the way, there's already a lot of rail above it, but go ahead. Keep
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:02.720]   going. Yeah. So well, this was a proof of concept. And they did do it very quickly with only
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:06.560]   money that they got from the hotels, like the hotel associate, you know, you go to a
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:10.680]   hotel, there's like a thousand fees for being in Vegas in addition to the resort fee. But
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:13.960]   anyway, they built it and they put Teslas supposed to be autonomous. The Teslas can't
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:18.280]   be autonomous because the this was the best. The drivers will tell you anything, by the
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:23.760]   way. So they were telling us like the inside scoop of how the cars since the walls are
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:30.200]   so close to the sides of the cars, self driving system goes nuts because if you get a Tesla,
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:35.320]   so you have to manually drive it the proximity. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They just beep, beep, beep,
[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:39.280]   beep, beep, beep. That's good. So they're going to have to write special software for
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:43.960]   these cars that just allow them to go through this tunnel. But the tunnel is cool. It reminds
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:48.480]   me I grew up in New Jersey going to the Lincoln tunnel, you know, to New York City. You know,
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:53.040]   that's cool. That's fun. That's a fun drive. I've done that. Yeah. It's a big tunnel with
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:57.560]   a lot like you said, safety in this. This has none of that none of that. It says cars
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:22:03.120]   that go on. Yeah. Let's see. I'm on batteries that can explode. Right. And what the hell?
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:07.280]   Let's go ahead and try it out. But here was the best part of the whole tunnel situation.
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:11.960]   So we went down there. We shot for like three hours, took like a hundred rides one day.
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:15.840]   And then we go back to the stage just to do like a couple like we call them wraps. You
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:19.880]   like the idea. Oh, you get serious. You spend a lot of time in there. But the best part
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:24.200]   was the next day we go down there like, Oh, sir, sorry, you can't film down here. Just
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:30.760]   spent a few days. Oh, they yesterday filming like, no, no, no, orders from up above no filming.
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:35.520]   We're like, OK, well, yesterday your car drivers were telling giving us interviews and all
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:40.000]   say anyway, they had like a big. Was that because there was a traffic jam that because
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.160]   there was a traffic jam, wasn't there? Yeah. Well, I see those pop up every now and again
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:47.960]   on Twitter where they're like, Oh, yeah, well, it's like, OK, so here's what it is. It's
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:52.080]   a tunnel and instead of a subway, it's got you could put cars through it. Yeah, we invented
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:57.640]   the subway. You know, like a couple of years ago. Oh, no, no, only specific kinds of cars
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:01.840]   can go in. Yeah, that's it. Like I just it's such a weird. This looks to me like a very
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:07.160]   scary Disney ride to me. That's what it felt like. It's really cool. Like a Disney ride.
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:11.400]   It's really cool to go through it. I went through it when it opened. Yeah. And it was
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:16.120]   it is fun. I would do it. I would. So it's like I take my chances. It's a tunnel. OK,
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:19.800]   hold on. Look at look at the tunnel right now. You see how it's affected with like those lines.
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:24.800]   It looks like a million cars have crashed into the wall. I mean, why decided to use that
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:29.040]   they look like scrapes. They do look like scrapes. Yeah. Yeah, they're not they're painted
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:33.600]   there. That's not scrapes. That's just to make. That's that's intentional. That's weird.
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:37.840]   Yeah, to make you look like you're moving faster is what that is. If it were just white, you
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:44.640]   would just feel like you were getting reboo. Oh, OK, I get that. But but I that I still
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:48.520]   feel like it does. This is the birth canal is what it is. And they don't wrap the whole
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:54.160]   thing in LED and like do it. Yeah, make it fun. Come on. Do it like Fremont Street. Come
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:58.840]   on. Yeah. It is kind of cool. This is kind of cool. And now you're in up. Cool. Yeah,
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:03.360]   now that would have been a long walk. But they're not they're not autonomous. Somebody's
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:08.680]   driving the whole time. Yeah, somebody is driving and they they go 40. They go 30 miles on the
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:12.960]   on the curves and then 40 miles on the straightaway. Although if you get a good driver, they'll
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:18.880]   go a little faster than that. So they have they actually allowed to like step you can
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:24.920]   say step on it. I'm in a hurry. Oh, yeah. Can you say follow that Tesla? It's actually
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:29.560]   it's it's very confusing down there. I had a driver who didn't know the lay of the land.
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:34.840]   So I guess they hired a bunch of them and they he was like, you turn. No, no, you can't
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:39.520]   make you turns in the tunnel. Oh, you turn. Oh, it was.
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:46.960]   I don't know. That's a stern. I didn't want to question it, but it was. That reminds me
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:51.840]   of the Austin Powers scene where he's trying to turn turn the golf cart around in the
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:56.680]   tunnel. Point turn. He's doing another point turn. I thought I was being punked because
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:25:01.960]   he he literally did a he we didn't do we did a you in the main area. Yeah, I can't do it
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:05.760]   there. Obviously. Yeah, I can't do it in a tunnel. Yeah, but I was like, dude, what wait,
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:09.840]   there's only like literally two tunnels here. Like, how do you not know which way is which
[00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:13.800]   it seems? I mean, look, it's cool. I mean, it's cool. But how many? How much do cost?
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:18.840]   It must have cost hundreds of millions of dollars to dig that. I think it was 47 million
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:22.640]   and it took a couple of years. I remember they've been digging it for a long time. No,
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:27.720]   no, it was less than a year. No, and it was and there was no machine. Yes. And that they
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:31.120]   show that I show that at the end of my video. It looks like something that fell out of the
[00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:35.680]   sky like an alien spaceship. I'm not kidding. It's this huge, you saw it actually, right?
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:41.640]   Yeah, yeah. The event in in at the was it on SpaceX, where they did that big event where
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:46.480]   they said, Oh, yeah, here's the it was when they initially said, here's the drill that
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:50.040]   we're going to use to like drill all these holes and then it's much faster than a snail
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:52.880]   or something like that. They were like really excited about it. This was like years ago.
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:57.960]   I am just glad. It's a wild machine. Pretty incredible. I'm just glad that Elon takes
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:05.680]   a lot of drugs because as a result, unlike anybody else in the world, he is willing to
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:13.600]   do crazy things. You saw the what he's what he's building to catch the Starship. The Starship
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:21.640]   is going to land in they call him chopsticks because Elon says it's just like in the yeah,
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:26.240]   like karate kid where he catches a fly with chopsticks. The the rocket's going to land
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:31.680]   and the crane's going to catch it. And then it's going to take it and it's going to reposition
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:37.920]   it for the next flight. I like to call that a pincer maneuver. That's a that's a literally
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:43.880]   a pincer maneuver that they call him the chopsticks. If he didn't take serious psychedelics,
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:48.160]   you think he would have imagined this? I mean, this is not need people like this. I think
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:54.040]   you need to talk about out of the box. Yeah, like what's his name? Bayzo's. I mean, look,
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:57.960]   the guy is like now he's just like on these islands. He's doing all these like he's just
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:01.520]   like working out all day. He's turned into pit pole is what has happened. Right. He's
[00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:07.200]   like MCU superhero. Yeah. He's like getting swole. Yeah. I'm like, I'm doing bulletproof
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:12.080]   for breakfast. Meanwhile, Elon's looking more and more like a potato, but he's got great
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:16.400]   ideas. He's like, if you bought my latest, you don't go. His great ideas are he just
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:19.720]   finding people who are really good at this. I mean, obviously, I mean, that's the point
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:26.120]   he runs not doing the engineering, but I do feel like I could see him at a meeting going,
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:32.120]   what if we had chopsticks eating? Okay, let's let's just like this is exactly what happened.
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:38.560]   He's eating flaming hot Cheetos out of a bag with chopsticks, and he was like, I got it.
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:44.400]   I have and I hope this is what I want. I had a producer on TV who had an invention. She
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.480]   really wanted to market this. I think it never happened because this was years ago called
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:54.280]   Chito gloves that you would put on before eating and then you wouldn't have orange hands. Obviously,
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:57.880]   you spent a lot of time eating Cheetos. You know that? You know that that's the entire
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:01.960]   thing about Cheetos. The kids, they love they actually put a certain amount of that stuff.
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:07.400]   They love to have that if it if it didn't leave that residue, you could stop eating them.
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:12.600]   Yeah, but you know, but also one of the hottest pictures I've ever seen of someone eating
[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:17.880]   food was Oscar Isaac eating flaming hot Cheetos with a pair of chopsticks. So I'm just saying.
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:24.440]   Did I like look that up now? I am absolutely googling that right now as is everybody else.
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:32.600]   Ashley, you did it again. Oscar Isaac explains viral video of him eating chopsticks.
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:35.400]   Yeah, I'm looking at this now. This is actually pretty hot. I'm not going to lie.
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:41.400]   Am I I'm not wrong? No, you're not at all. I'm hot.
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:45.480]   And look at a red, by the way. I like it. Look at that is a man who is
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:50.680]   he that's ingenuity right there. That's a ingenuity. That's someone who gets creative.
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:54.840]   Who can I just one can I just one thing can I ask you?
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:59.240]   Who's Oscar Isaac? No Leo Leo.
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:04.440]   Did I tell you about that time I met Thomas Elva Edison?
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:07.800]   All right. I asked her at the world.
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:11.800]   I don't know who this guy is here. You don't worry. No, God.
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:16.600]   Okay, you don't know who he is. I'm going to leave you. But then I you don't. You never seen a Star
[00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:23.640]   War. I've seen a star war. Is he a star war? Who is he? He's the star of the frickin
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:30.920]   second trilogy or those who lead or have a trades in Dune. Really? Yeah. I didn't recognize him.
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:35.960]   You know, the problem is he's he's wearing a took and I didn't recognize him in the took.
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:40.360]   Oh, and the mustache. Yeah, if you look at him with his real pictures,
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:45.000]   here is his kitchen eating Cheetos. I didn't recognize him.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:51.720]   Wow. So I do kind of a make. Christina and I are this is now officially this week in Oscar Isaac.
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:55.480]   We're changing the name. Oh, he's an Adams family too. Okay. Okay. I remember.
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:30:00.040]   Okay. Gomez not a favorite of mine. I've never seen that movie. What? I mean, I'm going to confess.
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:03.880]   I'm not a big Star Wars fan either. Did you see Dune though, Leo? I did. I loved Dune.
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:11.560]   What does he do? He's a leader of House of Trades. He's a leader. Okay. Do Clito.
[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:18.920]   Yep. All right. I just, you know, by the way, the things you learn super different. I will give
[00:30:18.920 --> 00:30:24.520]   you that. He did that picture. Then he does 100% totally fair. Thank you. That must have been.
[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:30.360]   Is this Christina Warren eating chopstick eating hot Cheetos with chopsticks or is that just my
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:35.400]   imagination? That's just that is not me. But that looks like that could be me. Could be you.
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:39.160]   That could be me. That is not me. I wish it was. Could that actually give him Sunday?
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:44.520]   Honestly, no, I mean, down to the beanie, the whole thing. The whole thing. It could be you.
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:49.160]   It's a vibe. All right. I want to take a little break. I just want to, I don't, I don't want to
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:54.360]   press my opinion here, but it feels a little bit like CES has become
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:31:00.680]   and actually not become. It has been for a long time. Kind of mostly just get get get
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:06.360]   those gadgets and gimmicks. Yeah. All the big companies left. So it's cars. It's a car show and
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:11.000]   it's like a weird gadget show. It's a little gimmicky. Yeah. Completely. All right. Well, that's
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:17.160]   fun. TVs. Don't forget TVs because I have personally, I like that is actually my favorite part. Oh, man.
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:22.040]   I love that part where you walk in the main doors and there's LG and they've got the video
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:28.600]   waterfall. How was the video waterfall this year, Rich D'Amour. Leo, LG's booth was actually empty.
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:36.040]   100%. So if you look, I'm trying to find my tweet. It's unbelievable. It's just, they did,
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:38.680]   I guess they didn't know if they were going to go to the show or not until the end. So they didn't
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:44.040]   plan it. And so it's literally just, it was plywood and then a bunch of QR codes that you would scan.
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:48.680]   It was like a virtual booth and it was like the biggest letdown. It was huge. I mean, it was a
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:51.560]   huge area when you first walked in. Yeah, because it's a huge footprint. It's massive,
[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:54.280]   so our footage that they take up everything. Yeah, I was going to say, I was going to say,
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:58.200]   like they pay so much money for that. I mean, that was just a good write-off for them. I'm sure
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:02.200]   that they were just like, all right. Oh, man. You're just writing, you're just writing all of this off
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:08.680]   and we are not going and I feel the work for the small companies that pay a lot of money to be
[00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:14.520]   there and just, man, they got hosed. Yeah. Oh, can I tell you about a startup that I saw that was so
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:18.280]   wild and crazy that you could tell me what you think? I know you got to go to commercial, but
[00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:24.120]   can I just go do so quick? Yeah. This isn't KTLA. We got a commercial when we feel like it.
[00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:29.960]   KTLA, please. Well, I would have been off like 20 minutes. Yeah, I know. I know. Believe me, I know.
[00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:35.320]   Yeah. So, okay, it's a startup called Halo Car. Have you heard of this? No.
[00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:40.920]   Okay, so it's a ride-sharing startup and they bring a car to your house just like kind of,
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:44.760]   remember Zipcar where you go and you get a car and you unlock it with your phone and like use it.
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:49.400]   I don't know if you in New York City was big. Anyway, this is a ride-sharing startup where they
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:54.280]   deliver the car to your house and then you drive the car, but how they're delivering the car to your
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:33:02.680]   house is with a guy who is driving the car using like a video game controller from an office building.
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:07.560]   Wow. It's a pretty cool car too, right? Well, this is, I don't know. What is this video?
[00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:13.480]   I don't know. This is Halo Inner Space Autonomous Luxury Car CES 2022. Could there be two halos?
[00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:16.280]   No, there's this. This one's from GM. Oh my God.
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:20.520]   Now that's a collision. That's a concept car from GM. From Cadillac.
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:24.600]   Yeah. It's my, I don't know how you find tweets, but it's on my Twitter.
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:29.240]   How do you can search your Twitter? Look, you can search your Twitter page now.
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:32.680]   You know that? I know, but not on the website though. How does the Twitter word?
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:37.640]   I think it's only on mobile. Rich? I think you can. If I write your name, Rich
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:44.360]   De Mero, and I write Halo, let's see what I could find here. No results.
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:47.000]   Try Rich on Tech Halo car.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:53.240]   I think we know. I was just waiting to me to send you a link. But anyway, so this guy is driving
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:57.800]   using like a standard like video game rig from an office building and he drops the car off to your
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:01.560]   house and then you just drive it regularly. And then when you're done, you will pick it up and
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:05.160]   it's driving itself through the streets. Like, is it this? It's out of driver.
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:08.040]   Halo is my favorite ice cream. Oh, gosh.
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:15.240]   What is it, Rich? How do I just say? How do I feel like you're grandma?
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:21.800]   Oh, my gosh. Never mind. It doesn't matter. I believe you. I really do. I'm sure it was.
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:25.720]   I'm not kidding. You got to see this guy driving it. It's just so wild that it's like,
[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:28.520]   oh, my gosh, how is it on your, it's on your Twitter feed?
[00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:32.680]   I'm going to buy it. I'll send you a link. You, you tweet too much.
[00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:37.320]   If you didn't, I know it's great too much. I could find it. I'm going through your Twitter feed.
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:42.360]   It was on a I found it. I found it. I found it. Look it. But that doesn't do me any good.
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:44.920]   I know. I'm going to send the link. I'm going to send the link. Share your screen.
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:51.080]   Yeah, that'll make the production. Fairly. Oh, here. Here's this.
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:54.760]   Sending it to everyone in the Zoom chat. It's right there. Where you say share my screen.
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:58.600]   And I just like, I got bad news for you. I am not in the Zoom chat. In fact,
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:04.360]   no one's in the Zoom chat. You're all alone in your own Zoom chat. Your own little Zoom chat.
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:08.760]   Is this it? Is this it? Rich, I found this on your Twitter. Is that it?
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:13.000]   January 7th. Keep scrolling. Keep scrolling. You got to go to January 7th.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:18.280]   January 7th. No joke. This SUV has been driven remotely from this gaming style rig.
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:22.920]   And the best way to do it is you have to get to hit media first so you get past all this.
[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:29.400]   Oh, if I go to media. Yeah. This is teaching Leo how to use the Twitter.
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:35.400]   It's kind of a long way since Edison Leo. I'm man. If Thomas, oh, look at that.
[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:39.080]   That was a good dessert. Keep going. Oh, you're close. It's January 8th. Keep going.
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:46.360]   Here I am at a Tesla charger. Here I am at the California state line. This is like Rich's home
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:53.880]   slideshow. Here I am in front of the casino. Here I am. Here it is. Here it is. I found it.
[00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:58.520]   There it is. Well, that's one shot of that. How boring is that? That's boring.
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:02.280]   These are the self-driving race cars. Keep going down. Oh, here's the guy driving.
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:05.160]   It's one lower. That's the guy driving. There's a video one lower.
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:12.440]   Aren't you glad this is not your job? He looks so bored. All right. Here we go.
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:16.600]   Okay. So there's the car driving. When did they put a racetrack in at the Las Vegas Convention
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:21.960]   Center? That's the first. Is that the Speedway? Yeah. The Speedway. Yep. They did self-driving
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:27.400]   race cars. So that's not so hard because it's really just going in a circle. Well, yeah, but he's
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:31.320]   going to be doing it on city streets in Las Vegas. That's where it's launching this year.
[00:36:31.320 --> 00:36:35.240]   Oh, man. That's so wild to me. Is that why? That's why. That's why I'm driving the car off.
[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:39.640]   And then you drive it around and then it's like he drives it back to home base. Right. Exactly.
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:45.080]   So it's like it's like I mean, it's brilliant. I love it. I agree. I'm loving this game.
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:48.760]   I'm loving this driving. I guess if you play forza, you'd be right at home.
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:56.760]   I was like, I have my boss's boss has been a significant amount of money like having a racing
[00:36:56.760 --> 00:37:00.920]   rig in his house, you know, with like all the monster. I spent all that good Microsoft money
[00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:07.400]   on something. Well, yeah, I mean, he's a CDP. So yeah. Yeah. But he has like, you know, the whole like
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:13.080]   system and and shit. Exactly. Yeah. But imagine if you've had that, but you're actually controlling
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:18.760]   a car, like people would pay for that opportunity. Would they work from home? It is a new generation
[00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:23.800]   of kids. Yeah. That literally are like, okay, I'm trained on this. I know how to use it. And now I
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:29.080]   have a job from my house that I can deliver these cars to people. I mean, it's this is the kind of
[00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:33.640]   stuff that I do think is just mind boggling. When this guy was explaining me this startup,
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:37.960]   my eyes just placed over. I'm like, I thought Zipcar and Uber were cool. And this is like,
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:43.320]   who would have thought wild? Well, what's crazy to me, I can't drive a real car, but I could drive,
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:47.640]   like, one of those. Like, that's that's the thing to me, like driving actual cars gives me
[00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:52.120]   massive anxiety. But I'm very good at like this way. If you hit somebody, you're not really there.
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:54.840]   But then also like you driving a car. You don't have to sleep.
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:38:00.440]   The same. Massive anxiety. So I don't know how that I was going to say. I mean, look, this is why
[00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:06.120]   we just need this. I think I hit somebody. We just need the self driving thing to be like a real
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:11.320]   thing. And then I, no one has to worry at all. I'm just saying, like, I'm seeing you. I need you
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:18.360]   to burn all the video. I am not confident. There, there. I mean, you hit a lot of a lot of people
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:22.520]   in the grip that I was trying to have more of rich Christina and Ashley teach Leo how to use
[00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:27.240]   Twitter coming up. But first a word from our sponsor. It's great to have you three. This makes
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:33.160]   me, this makes my life very easy. I basically just sit back and let you guys talk. I'll find another
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:38.920]   topic here and we can talk about that too. Ashley, a scetha, C net, great to see you. It's been a
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:44.280]   while. You are on fleek. Do the kids still say that you are on fleek today? I'm not a kid. I don't
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:50.760]   know. I don't know. No, you look great. Sliving is that that's a parasilta. Sliving. I stand you. I
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:54.360]   understand that's something else. I'm living today. I'm living. I'm standing with the sliv.

[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:08.760]   that? Maybe no. It's too late. Too late. It's too late. It's too late, baby. It's too late. And

[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:31.480]   moving with you guys since the very beginning. IT Pro TV. Gosh, I wish CES were all year long
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:36.520]   with so much fun talking about that. I get your point now. It's interesting, right? It's fun.
[00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:38.600]   It's fun. It's fun. It's fun. I love it.
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:44.360]   No, E3 this year, they just called it off. Online only.
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:50.920]   I don't know, Leo. I have some friends who have friends.
[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:55.800]   And I... Is your friend named Joy Bananas? Yeah, totally.
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:06.840]   And so I have heard that they actually pulled out of their commitment to the ESA,
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:10.600]   pulled out of their commitment to the Convention Center space in November.
[00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:13.400]   Yeah. Oh, they didn't. They planned this months ago.
[00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:20.680]   And so that there was actually maybe even before Omicron kind of picked up. And I think it was just
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:25.080]   a good reason for them to say, "Hey, we're going to go virtual again." I think I'm a little...
[00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:30.840]   I don't know. Now I am only speculating, but I can only guess that maybe there wasn't a lot
[00:43:30.840 --> 00:43:35.160]   of interest. And I think that because Sony pulled out of it, it's sort of like CES, right?
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:38.840]   So Sony... It's worse because there's only a handful... It's worse because there's only a handful.
[00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:42.680]   ...once Google left. In gaming. In gaming. It becomes a different show.
[00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:46.840]   Yeah. I mean CES, you've got a lot of other stuff, but in gaming, it's the big boys aren't...
[00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:50.760]   If they're not there... And they haven't for a long time. Like when Sony pulled out,
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:55.800]   Nintendo's never really been part of it. So it's been dying even before COVID, right?
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:44:01.720]   So you think this... I remember, I think the last time Nintendo did an in-person press conference,
[00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:07.000]   like that wasn't a Nintendo Direct was back when the Wii was happening.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.240]   Which was the last... It was the Wii. That was the last time I was ever used to.
[00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:12.520]   It was like, "The Last Game that I remember covering there."
[00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:17.880]   Well, they've had... They have boots. Like they've had boots. Yeah, they too their... Yeah.
[00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:23.560]   But the actual press conference... They used to do events. All three of the big guys used to do events.
[00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:30.200]   In a theater. And I remember that for things like later we... Like all of the later we stuff,
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:33.480]   and maybe early Wii U, but that's about it. Like I don't think...
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:36.920]   The Wii U was not there. I remember that. The Wii U was not there because they had a separate
[00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:42.520]   event and they had even at CES the Wii U is out. They showed it to me in a hotel room that was
[00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:47.880]   not part of CES because they didn't want to get the CEA any money at all. And then that E3...
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:50.440]   Because they don't need to. They don't need to. That's the thing, right?
[00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:54.120]   This is a phone... As Sony doesn't need to either, right? Because it's a big... This is a phone badly for E3.
[00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:58.440]   I mean CES went on. Oh yeah. Yeah, I think so. But it sounds like... And I know CES will be
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:02.280]   here next year, but you think E3 maybe not. No. I mean it's been dying for years.
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:08.520]   Yeah. And I think the problem is... Okay. So it's like a two-fold problem. So what you have is you have
[00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:16.120]   a convention that used to be like tight industry only and liars like me and Christina. So we used to
[00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:21.640]   have those back group of people. And the 16-year-old mix. Pretend industry. And the 16-year-old liars,
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:27.240]   absolutely. But overall, like really it was like not super of interest and most of the gaming
[00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:31.880]   community was getting that information in magazines. So we're getting at print media the next month
[00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:36.920]   after, right? So now with streaming, now with the ability to live stream a press conference,
[00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:41.720]   with the ability to show off all of your games just right there on YouTube or Twitch or wherever
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:47.800]   you want whatever delivery platform you feel like putting it out on, E3 has become less and less
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:51.320]   relevant and less and less... But why is it the same truth? It's certainly less and less necessary
[00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:54.680]   to be there in person. Why isn't that true for CES? I mean you could say the same for it. Because
[00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:59.960]   CES is about gadgets and new purposes. Yeah. And there's just so many companies. And there's
[00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:05.080]   so many little companies. And that's really what it's about. It's like anyone can, I call it bubbling
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:10.680]   up to the top. Like any company that goes to CES has the ability to win the show because it takes
[00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:14.520]   one journalist to find something cool. They blog about it and then a thousand other people do the
[00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:17.680]   same thing. They go and find that. The gaming industry is much more narrow. That's a
[00:46:17.680 --> 00:46:22.200]   second to brush. Yeah. And also it's just I'm so want that to work. I'm so want that to work. I know
[00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:25.400]   me too. I'm so want that to work. I know me too. By proxy of what it is. This is a crazy brush.
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:29.960]   We should mention in here at least you go. It's a full mouth brush. It's a mouth guard
[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:34.120]   that you put in having it at the show for so long and now it's never going to take off.
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:39.640]   Of course never. Forever. And you know I know what the secret is in CES. You buy right inside the
[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:45.160]   door at Showstoppers or Pepcom and one of the preshow because journalists are lazy. Not you,
[00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:50.040]   Rich. You covered it all. But most TV guys that come in. I was I was lazy. Absolutely. They go to
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:55.720]   Showstoppers. The first thing they see they do a bit and they go home. We're done. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:46:55.720 --> 00:47:00.280]   Yeah. I told it. So most invariably the story of the show is the first thing in the door at Showstoppers.
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:06.360]   And that's it. Oh it's like it's so it's. But when gaming too to Ashley's point you also you have
[00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:12.200]   competition from like the more enthusiast consumer shows like PAX right so if I was a big game
[00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:15.560]   company like I would and I went on my enthusiast there and you have TwitchCon and you have these
[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:21.400]   other things so like E3 as a concept I think even before Omocron the big companies were going to do
[00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:25.880]   their own events. The smaller companies who want to kind of get the fan feedback have better spaces
[00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:32.200]   for that that aren't encumbered by all the e3ness of e3. The trade and yeah. The trade aspect right.
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:36.440]   They don't even have to have to pretend with that you know because I would much rather go to PAX
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:42.680]   than e3 if I'm being honest and then you know it's kind of like and then you have gaming has
[00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:48.840]   gone into other spaces you have a comic con which is just this massive juggernaut of
[00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:53.240]   of horror at this point but it's you know this massive thing where if you have a big property I
[00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:59.000]   would much rather if I'm going to put my money into a summer thing in southern California I would
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:04.200]   much rather look at doing something right I'm a con what about VidCon is that is that a well VidCon
[00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:09.960]   is all like it's it's tick to creators creators yeah content creators I think the other 16 year olds
[00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:16.760]   love that one so oh yeah I love I love VidCon I want to feel old go to VidCon oh I know you want to feel
[00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:19.960]   really old go to VidCon but also you want to feel like like on your death it is a font of
[00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:27.240]   information it is a font of great information about creating like so good the seminar it just
[00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:31.720]   yeah that's very true these people like to share their you know what they learn with other people
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:36.040]   very generous and I like I love it it's a wonderful it's really a wonderful conference
[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:40.840]   if you can block out the sound of 12 year old screaming um which is like over someone that you've
[00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:46.360]   never seen before in your life like Oscar what's his name yeah I like Oscar Isaac um but I know
[00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:52.360]   he's not in the Star Wars so Christina mentioned like one of the things about she mentioned PAX
[00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:58.920]   and Comic Con and I think one of the things that happened with E3 is there was a time when all of
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:04.200]   the exhibitors because it was industry only and press it was a place where they could show you
[00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:10.040]   behind closed doors games or even on the show floor games that they weren't quite ready to show
[00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:15.320]   right everybody else that they they wanted you to preview them now the show is open to a small
[00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:20.760]   percentage but still a percentage of the public which which now that means all of those games
[00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:24.600]   either get pulled from the pulled for me three because they're not ready to show them yet and
[00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:30.840]   they're not ready to you know be presentable to the public who doesn't really generally understand
[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:37.320]   like you know game development and can't quite you know judge it properly or they may judge it more
[00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:43.080]   harshly based on what's presented to them and then on top of that journalists are now struggling to
[00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:48.840]   get time with games like that and also all of the games on the floor because some of these lines as
[00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:54.040]   I'm sure rich and Christina can attest to I remember when Breath of the Wild was on the show floor it
[00:49:54.040 --> 00:49:58.680]   was a six hour wait and they closed the line off right in the morning I mean it's the whole it would
[00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:02.360]   wrap around the whole entire booth and then it was like sorry the lines closed for the day but
[00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:07.080]   doesn't that mean this is more popular than ever and this is a huge and growing industry and it's
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:13.240]   vital isn't that all good for E3 well the thing is not able to take advantage of it it's good for
[00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:18.440]   video games right it's good for video games it's not good for E3 because because of the advent and
[00:50:18.440 --> 00:50:24.520]   the boom of streaming and streaming games and being you just don't need that conference and this is
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:30.520]   why we've seen all of tech do exactly the same thing we saw Apple pull out of CES we've seen Google
[00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:35.320]   Microsoft like all of these massive companies are like we'll just do it ourselves 2019 when
[00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:41.560]   Kano Reeves came on stage for cyberpunk 2077 and the game still was great a piece of crap and
[00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:48.680]   and I'm sure it's better now it's better it was it was not ready there are new ways that tech
[00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:56.040]   companies can can get the interest of the media and journalists and the public and that's really
[00:50:56.040 --> 00:50:59.640]   I mean you can go viral directly to those people you can well exactly you go to
[00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:04.840]   games and we know this because we try to do a video game show is it's a very fragmented arena I
[00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:10.280]   mean there's console gamers there's PC gamers there's casual game right there there isn't there's no
[00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:15.880]   monolithic video game industry and frankly console gamers couldn't care less about anything else
[00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:21.560]   or PC gamers look down their nose at console game so it's so fragmented I think maybe it is better
[00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:24.760]   just to go direct to those people and those people are sophisticated enough they're gonna
[00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:28.120]   watch your twitch stream or YouTube video and they're gonna seek out they're already reading
[00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:32.280]   about a game they're already seeking it out they're already trying to find it and they yeah they
[00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:39.080]   just don't need it it's it's it is really an inherent thing of the ESA needs these companies the
[00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:43.160]   companies don't need them like they don't need but there is there is one thing as a person though
[00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:47.720]   and I will say the um and this is you know as a journalist yeah I get to go to these things but
[00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:53.080]   I think as a as you know even growing up like there's any there's a shared experience right like a car
[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:58.680]   show uh CES like yes like v3 like there is something as a nerd or someone who is part of a group
[00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:03.800]   exactly like you want to be there you want to be with just people that share your interests no
[00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:08.840]   matter what does that mean the fan conventions like Max East and and and Comic Con those will
[00:52:08.840 --> 00:52:15.320]   become bigger rather than the industry trade shows I mean I think so like Pax West happens at the
[00:52:15.320 --> 00:52:19.160]   Seattle convention center usually um uh Washington State convention center or whatever like it
[00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:24.440]   happens up the street from my house and yeah it does become like kind of that congregation of
[00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:28.600]   of you have you know players and and that's the whole thing with that is that you know they they
[00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:33.640]   put the it's like Comic Con like the the gamers are people like being with these channels they like
[00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:40.280]   to be a fan facing fan facing I love that fans first it's always fan think about it who were the
[00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:47.880]   real fans at e3 it was you 16 year olds lying to get in it was a couple of dummies uh making fake
[00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:52.120]   business cards that's who you make these trade shows for not the industry the industry doesn't
[00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:57.400]   need that you have to be fake to get in you can't anyone real can't get in from now on you have to
[00:52:57.400 --> 00:53:02.680]   have you got press credentials let me see your clippings oh you can't come in no you don't know
[00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:07.560]   don't know if it's gonna lie yeah to truth it's gonna lie before you can get in I love it
[00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:12.360]   uh all right well I'm sad because uh actually uh I remember when e3 was started was a
[00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:17.400]   genus Smith in electronic entertainment magazine that started e3 way back in the day and was very
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:24.120]   exciting and for a while it's definitely served its purpose but uh but yeah with streaming it's just
[00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:29.080]   it's it's a little bit that's why I don't leave that's what I still don't understand why there
[00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:34.760]   any trade shows at all I really thought covid would just kill the trade show I mean cars I understand
[00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:39.720]   because you have to see the car yeah see the car drive the car get a feel for the car also
[00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:43.400]   there's something to be said for like rich said there's a there's a collective experience that's
[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:48.600]   a media I mean there's two different things it's the fan shows so that's fans and then there's
[00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:53.080]   media that goes to trade shows like ces and they like we like hanging out here's what's here's the
[00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:59.000]   dirty secret of all these these uh these trade shows is that the the best journalists are on the
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:03.800]   inside already they've gone hands-on with the stuff right for the trade show learning anything
[00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:07.720]   they don't even go to the booths I mean they they get these things in closed rooms I mean so
[00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:12.520]   it's a whole like it's really fascinating to kind of break it down I do understand what you're saying
[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:16.920]   but there is I think that the main thing is that these trade shows generate a lot of revenue and
[00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:21.400]   that's another part of this and it's also a big group that has a lot of power and so there's a
[00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:26.840]   look at Sheldon Niggles going on he's this is the billionaire that ces built and his or
[00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:30.920]   comdex built in his his smart move was to get out of it before it started declining
[00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:36.200]   um yeah did he sell he sold it to ces right to cta or whatever i can't remember who bought
[00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:41.400]   uh comdex but comdex went away but he spold it for billions before it collapsed became a very
[00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:47.080]   influential uh uh republican donor and billionaire he just died recently and yeah he was Las Vegas
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:55.160]   like he owned Las Vegas yeah oh wow Vegas yeah yeah the shellies uh all right how about let's see
[00:54:55.160 --> 00:54:58.840]   I want to pick something that you guys will get as excited about I don't know what it is though
[00:54:58.840 --> 00:55:04.200]   a lot of this stuff can we talk about iMessage the google iMessage i want to tell you all right okay
[00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:08.920]   cool i just have the 10 hands first of all i knew we would all have opinions how many of
[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:15.400]   you are green bubbles how many of you are blue bubbles i'm a blue ball you're all blue bubbles
[00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:19.960]   obviously just because i'm forced into the ecosystem i can never get out you wrote a book about it
[00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:25.320]   you have to do it okay so honestly i switched to iphone when i wrote the books and i i have not
[00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:30.840]   gone back it's been so you're a big old phony no it's funny my friend was interviewing me
[00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:35.960]   no i i switched when i wrote the book because i was like this is when i get the most questions about
[00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:43.080]   and honestly it was the best thing i ever did and it it like i grew to love the iphone so much in that
[00:55:43.080 --> 00:55:47.160]   time because i was sort of an android person and now i can't go back because there's so many
[00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:51.000]   things that the iphone does especially for production but anyway let's let's besides the point let's
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:57.160]   get the wall straight journal began this uh conversation with with a pure link bait you know
[00:55:57.160 --> 00:56:01.480]   it's one of those stories we don't have anything to write about i know i got it why apple's i
[00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:06.920]   message is winning teens dread the green text bubble and they say the blue bubbles are
[00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:13.480]   pulling the green bubbles of poor people using uh android devices and you know this is a silly
[00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:22.440]   article except then google picks up on it says yeah yeah apple why don't yeah you're pulling us
[00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:28.600]   with your with your technical superiority and your your better sales it that's bad and then uh i
[00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:35.480]   love ronamadio's piece where he says we're let's let's call uh let's call i don't want to say a spade
[00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:42.280]   a spade but i don't know what else to say uh yeah i might let's call it as i see it that the real
[00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:48.520]   problem is that google ruined messaging for android please stop kicking our but so badly he writes
[00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:52.680]   after ruining android messaging google says i messaged is too powerful
[00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:59.080]   boo hoo hey lio scroll down in that article and look for uh there is a link in that article that
[00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:07.000]   made me i i almost scream laughed where it's under the heading reaping what you so yeah 25 000
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:12.440]   word article ron also wrote this full table of contents of all of the messaging programs and
[00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:17.640]   software that i knew has launched and killed and it's like awesome awesome like there's your evidence
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:23.480]   right there yep also if you care so much xmpp was a thing that google like google killed out of its
[00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:29.480]   way to killed yep and we could all be using xmpp right now but we're not so now google's pushing rcs
[00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:35.560]   which ron another say is antiquated because it's tied to your phone bill it's tied to your carrier
[00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:41.400]   nobody wants that every the problem is in the real world outside the us people use what's app
[00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:47.160]   or maybe telegram or facebook messengers signal uh depends what country you're in if you're in
[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:52.520]   brazil ninety percent of everybody uses what's app there's no blue bubbles green bubbles nope right
[00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:57.080]   but here in the united states for some reason we have this fragmented system
[00:57:57.080 --> 00:58:03.560]   uh i mean if you are using apples messages you can text anybody using sms but there
[00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:07.480]   there is a reason for this and let's let's be honest what apple did apple
[00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:13.400]   um hijacked people's phone numbers and put it into i message when you set up your phone and you go
[00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:18.200]   through that um you know that flow of of setting up your phone for the first time what does it say
[00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:21.320]   it says can we use this you know do you want to do you want to i'm i don't know what they say
[00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:25.640]   anymore do you want to ask this from your email or from your phone number and you can choose
[00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:29.720]   and and you can get both it's your account i don't even know if they ask you i know what he does it
[00:58:29.720 --> 00:58:33.640]   from your email they don't nobody uses it right no one does it from their email message no but
[00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:38.440]   they use the phone phone number unless they don't have a phone number which actually is people's phone
[00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:44.520]   numbers they put it they put it into this system and people are now in it and the reality is it works
[00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:49.560]   very well it's amazing well and even worse if you leave the iphone system you have to go through
[00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:55.160]   steps to take your phone number away out from apple or you're gonna have all sorts of trouble
[00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:59.160]   with your messaging now that's gotten a lot easier with that uh d-red i was gonna say the
[00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:04.120]   proof that it used to take days now it takes it's just enough to go to a separate website and
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:08.600]   the end of your number if you forget to turn it off before you turn it off before you have to
[00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:11.960]   do the same thing with what's happy blio you have to do the same thing with signal like any of those
[00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:17.480]   systems i agree no nothing should be tied to your phone number uh i agree i don't i mean i want i
[00:59:17.480 --> 00:59:22.760]   want a one messaging system for everyone because it's just it makes sense in today's day like i
[00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:28.360]   use telegram i love telegram because when i use telegram no matter who i'm talking to i don't think
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:33.480]   or they on an iphone oh can i send them a large picture oh can i send them a video can i do this
[00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:38.360]   can i do a reaction it just all works no matter what phone they're on whether you're using a 10-year-old
[00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:44.120]   phone and i do think there is a point to the whole you know apple does like to play this game of like
[00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:49.720]   we want um you know everyone to have like you know access to this and like we you know and then they
[00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:53.080]   go ahead and they do this thing where they're they're holding back iMessage which is a great
[00:59:53.080 --> 00:59:58.920]   program from other devices except their own and they're fully within their rights to do that but
[00:59:58.920 --> 01:00:05.560]   i do think it's not right you can also with telegram i think there's a short code t.me and your telegram
[01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:11.160]   name it's very easy to give somebody your telegram account i don't care what we use i just wish we
[01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:17.000]   agree on something well and that's the funny thing is most other countries have and it's you know
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:21.480]   the this story with the reason i thought it was kind of flawed is that there are always going to
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:26.360]   be in-group signifiers for teenagers sure when Ashley and i were teenagers did you have no
[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:31.240]   key a phone did you wear Abercrombie you know like did were you on aim like those were kind of the
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:36.840]   things um now for for a lot of teens now it's do you have an iphone like for 20 years i actually
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:41.560]   kind of want to write something about this the most enduring fashion symbol like of the last 20
[01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:45.960]   years i was thinking about this the other day has been white earbuds if you think that's right
[01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:49.960]   white earbuds has been the most enduring fashion like sad symbol of the last
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:54.680]   those things are going to happen but i guess the criticism is that apple has embraced this and
[01:00:54.680 --> 01:01:00.520]   and furthered it but but but i don't think that's a fair criticism to put on apple it's like the
[01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:05.960]   teens are never apple look the iphone is just a cooler product like it just is like according to
[01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:13.560]   this article 87 87 percent of teens surveyed last year by pipe or sandler have iphones 87
[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:19.720]   percent means are mean enough like why does your phone have to define you like yeah it's okay
[01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:24.840]   if they're being mean over the color of your bubble because we're all dumbies because we're all
[01:01:24.840 --> 01:01:28.760]   your teenager or your fozo yeah we're all mean yeah we're all mean yeah you are but why add to it why
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:33.000]   should apple this huge company why should they why should they cap on it they're not adding to it
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:37.320]   people they look right they will literally pick on anything honestly and most teens that i know
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:43.480]   use their their order of messengers goes discord instagram and then i message so i think that the
[01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:48.600]   yeah most teens i know use um discord far more i love discord i messaged discord is
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:51.960]   new i know you love discord they just love you tiktok tiktok
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:59.720]   message on tiktok you can't they just use dms on on tiktok oh okay yeah i get a lot of dms on instagram
[01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:04.440]   i don't even use it i think instagram that's my audience is on tv you know from tv is a little
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:09.000]   bit older and honestly like i get so many message from instagram i think it's almost like the the
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:13.400]   equalizing platform i don't want to give facebook anything though i don't want them i don't want to
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:17.800]   use what's apple or instagram because i don't want to give facebook anything yeah i mean i like so
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:23.480]   for me i feels like okay like i i totally understand what rich is saying about you know yes it is
[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:31.480]   it stinks that this has to be a thing right like this is like but also apple doesn't do this on
[01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:36.920]   purpose so that teenagers will only other kids it's just happened it they they stumbled into an
[01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:43.720]   extremely sticky thing of a feature on the phone they know we know this from the epic versus apple
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:47.880]   trial in the discovery they know a hundred percent of course they know it's lock in and they and they
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:53.880]   say this is good this is lock in but yeah very very big we got the emails are gonna bully other
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:59.640]   kids it's good because people are locked in like it's not right it's not it's good because of the
[01:02:59.640 --> 01:03:04.280]   stuff that you know teens are being mean to each other about right i would argue that apple
[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:08.760]   concealed the deal by just coming out with i message for android and plot and desktop platforms and
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:13.080]   then they just own messaging for an indefinite amount of time here in the u.s yeah but what do you
[01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:17.080]   get out of that i was gonna say i think i was gonna say i think that if they could make the business
[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:20.440]   case that that was where they needed to be they would do it they wouldn't and i don't even think i
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:24.680]   don't even think that they're afraid like i wouldn't switch away from an iphone if i message was available
[01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:29.560]   elsewhere i i i would still be an iphone user and i think most iphone users would be there are just
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:34.040]   those other things you know handoff they're continuity there are these other things yeah there's a lot
[01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:38.920]   with it right so i don't think that i message would be the only thing but i i personally i mean i
[01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:43.800]   don't begrudge them for saying yes we could completely dominate messaging if we went to these other
[01:03:43.800 --> 01:03:47.720]   platforms but but to ask this point what's the business case for that like why do they need to be
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:53.080]   in that like maybe one day they will but what's interesting uh john guber pointed this out and
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:58.040]   his story he um i i think it was nik here who mentioned this in his in his article like his
[01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:03.640]   uh blog about this so the iphone is even more popular in japan than it is in the u.s but the
[01:04:03.640 --> 01:04:10.840]   number one messenger there by far is line and so that just to me shows messaging services people
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:16.120]   are going to use but they're going to use i think it is notable that for more than a decade younger
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:23.400]   people have in the united states have been like hooked on iMessage but i mean if it's like it's like
[01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:27.720]   saying though the reasons to bully other things it's not philip norris's fault that kids smoke
[01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:34.760]   cigarettes here's the smoking gun literally or not literally figuratively from april 2013 this is
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:41.720]   the verge went through a lot of these epic uh discovery emails eddie q wants iMessage on android
[01:04:41.720 --> 01:04:47.560]   just in case google buys what's app phil shiller chief of marketing says and since we make no money
[01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:53.240]   on iMessage what will be the point i'm concerned iMessage on android would simply serve to remove
[01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:59.400]   an obstacle to iphone families giving their kids android phones that's correct federiggy i think
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:06.040]   we need to get android customers using and dependent on apple products they know exactly yeah of course
[01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:11.400]   of course look i'm going to give full credit here i i had i covered that trial and it's like those
[01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:18.440]   emails were incredible yeah i love that they wrote that stuff in here that they put it in writing
[01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:25.000]   crazy yes see the veneer of the dad's executive like clean squate these are ruthless businessmen
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:32.360]   just like every other company and and like the idea that craig federig hair force one wrote that
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:39.000]   email amazing brings me brings me an inordinate amount of joy to know that there is a ruthless
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:45.800]   cutthroat human being behind that friendly face this is another one 2016 all of these apple
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:51.560]   things they they get an email from the beats music co-founder ean rogers about quote how he missed a
[01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:57.240]   ton of messages from friends and family after switching to an android phone phil shiller writes
[01:05:57.240 --> 01:06:02.120]   to tim cook saying jaws and i think moving iMessage to android will hurt us more than help us this
[01:06:02.120 --> 01:06:08.040]   email illustrates why instead of saying oh this is a terrible experience they said see this is
[01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:15.160]   great this is keeping people on iPhones they not only know it they know of course it's they stumbled
[01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:21.240]   into this amazing sticky thing and and and to christina's point like it's not it's not a thing
[01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:26.760]   that is guaranteed in every country it just happened to happen okay people just really glommed on to i
[01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:32.440]   message and thought about the law completely screwed it up as you point out yeah there was no
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:37.480]   good competition google maybe but okay so hold on but would you rather have a world where google
[01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:42.600]   has their their messaging system that just works really well with all the androids and then this other
[01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:48.040]   messaging system iMessage that works with iPhones why like to me as a tech person i want stuff that
[01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:53.720]   works with everything but google that's what google would have done hang out worked everywhere google
[01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:57.640]   it was always in the world that it worked everywhere because they make money on usage
[01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:02.280]   apple makes money on iPhone sales so they're two different business models and that and it was
[01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:08.120]   in google's interest to make it universal obviously the perfect world it would be signal or some
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:12.600]   independent third party everybody in the United States would all of a sudden say let's use that
[01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:18.440]   and yes and that would be perfect right let's all agree on one day to switch and i'm i'm cool with
[01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:24.040]   telegram i mean it's not we did that with my family that's that's so my dad and my brother
[01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:28.840]   exactly pixels they use pixel devices that's that's their preference they love android they're
[01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:33.960]   tinkerers they like to get in there and and have customized everything and uh they were getting
[01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:39.320]   so upset because we would be in a group text and everybody else has an iPhone and they would not
[01:07:39.320 --> 01:07:44.360]   get like they would have like tiny videos and they would have this is all on sms and so i just
[01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:49.960]   said you know what like this is an important thing so we should just all have signal and so we all
[01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:56.360]   have a signal group chat and that's but it's like it's only for our close family and that's fine
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:08:00.280]   like to me that seems like a happy medium where i'm like okay see i feel like discord would have
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:05.240]   been a good choice there as well like because you can't get my whole family and that's tricky to get
[01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:09.560]   harder i was like i was gonna say getting her dad on discord would be difficult right like
[01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:14.840]   i think it was harder to get my mom and actually i argue it would have been harder to get all of the
[01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:18.840]   iPhone users in my family on discord one of the things is they don't want to download an app
[01:08:18.840 --> 01:08:23.320]   that's the other thing you try to get an iPhone user to download a messaging app and they say why
[01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:28.760]   well by message the messaging system in the world you can't make it to the fault apple locks you
[01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:32.920]   in because you can't if you could down if you could say let me help you download signal we'll make
[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:37.720]   that to the fault it would work just like my message you just wouldn't know you're not using it then
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:42.920]   it would be doable but apple won't let you make it the default i think that that will change actually
[01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:49.400]   i hope it does i think that's all of the i think with all of the you know the trial the the epic
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:55.000]   versus apple stuff with fortnight and the lot the ecosystem you don't think apple was emboldened
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:09:00.840]   by that they won that trial and every single point so yes and no yes and no so i i do think they
[01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:06.680]   were emboldened by that and i do think that it was a very like it was a it was a pretty strong message
[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:15.640]   uh that the court sent out but also i do i do argue that we are seeing uh regulation in the EU
[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:22.360]   that is gonna come over here we're gonna because now we're a much more we have a much more
[01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:32.120]   that like anti-monopoly do like regulation strong FTC like we're it's going to be the future is
[01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:38.840]   going to be this sort of dismantling of these siloed monies like however you want to call it
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:45.400]   you think you think you think FTC and congress can actually act in concert and make that happen
[01:09:45.400 --> 01:09:49.560]   and the courts i don't i they won't have to it's just the like you said actually it's the time
[01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:53.800]   is to come yes and i don't think that you could get away with the stuff that you used to be able
[01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:59.000]   to get away with which is something like bullying people into a certain thing like we're seeing
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:02.680]   if you look at almost everything like look at the streaming services you know like if you have
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:09.640]   fire tv or roku or uh apple or any of these you know chrome google tv pretty much you can get
[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:13.400]   all of the major streaming apps on those services now they try to play hardball once in a while
[01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:18.040]   but like could you imagine like the remember the days when like you couldn't get hbo on whatever
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:22.280]   and you'd be like yeah you would just switch and with the iphone it's really tough to switch because
[01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:27.400]   it's a whole world that you're in all because of this blue bubble but i do think there will come a
[01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:35.640]   point where there is some sort of red some sort of regulation that requires all uh phone makers to
[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:42.520]   allow users to choose a different default app to use for specific things so like i i don't see
[01:10:42.520 --> 01:10:46.120]   that happening honestly i think just like you went on an android phone i like i i think there might
[01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:51.640]   like if the case was narrow enough i think it could be argued no i don't see signal this is apples
[01:10:51.640 --> 01:10:55.960]   business apples not a monopoly it's only 50 percent of the market right right this is their
[01:10:55.960 --> 01:11:00.360]   platform it's their business we cannot in good conscience tell them how to run their business i
[01:11:00.360 --> 01:11:05.320]   don't think that works you'd have to have them be predacious you'd have to find something really
[01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:09.320]   evil and i don't think that's going to happen i really don't i mean they wrote all that stuff
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:15.000]   in those emails i know who knows by the way i thought about the way that you can tell people
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:19.160]   that you've moved to a service okay let's say you're on i message okay instead of switching to like
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:24.440]   you know sms you can um i thought about this a lot you can put on the uh automatic because there's
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:28.840]   no automatic reply on iphone you know you can't like on android you can set an automatic message
[01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:34.600]   reply to your sms but on iphone you set up the do not disturb while driving and you can set the
[01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:40.520]   message set it put in there i'm sorry i won't answer i have to be on my telegram now yes and so you
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:45.320]   put your little telegram link as your auto responder and you say hey i've moved to telegram and just
[01:11:45.320 --> 01:11:50.440]   find me there they click the link boom it's it's done i've thought about this a lot because uh it really
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:55.480]   bugs me it's a little workaround i'm sure that's it that's a hot tip i'm sure apple will cut that off
[01:11:55.480 --> 01:12:01.480]   at this point because have you done a great contact okay i have no i have no great tip you should do
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:06.040]   that no you know why you'll never do that you know why people would get exactly they would get
[01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:09.800]   upset why are you trying to get us off of iphone yeah what's wrong with it's the same reason why i
[01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:14.680]   don't really show people how to do ad blockers on them yeah it's yeah it's like that's fair it's
[01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:20.200]   there's certain things whereas a as a person who is doing very mainstream tech um you know it's
[01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:24.120]   i don't know it's just tough to do some of the stuff if someone asks me yes i will respond but
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:28.120]   it's not like i'm doing segments on this kind of stuff on tv you know that is a great tip that is
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:34.200]   a great tip yes wordle yes well god let's take a little break let's take a little break
[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:39.640]   everybody's first wordle what word which one's the one mind was query it was fairly recent because
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:45.400]   mine was apple which is also recent i mine was like two days ago i just started yeah wordles fun i
[01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:50.680]   usually pick uh audio or a rise because then you get a bunch of vowels oh what's your oh i see what
[01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:54.440]   you're saying what's the first word i thought you met the first word you solved you mean the word
[01:12:54.440 --> 01:13:00.760]   you start with yeah i usually have like do you have like one you usually use that's a great question i
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:05.400]   start with grant which is my husband's name but it's also a good start but real you should start with
[01:13:05.400 --> 01:13:10.520]   something with you fortune rstlne baby yes yes but i tried and it didn't work one of the most common
[01:13:10.520 --> 01:13:17.560]   comments be a word the most common letters e t a i o n s h r d l u so you should start with those
[01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:22.840]   something that uses those right no maybe i don't i do audio that's that's usually the one i
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:27.560]   oh that's a good way you do you do you get four vowels right out of the way oh that's great
[01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:33.720]   what's your quickest wordle guest time two two words that's just luck though right the mine was
[01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:40.280]   two yeah no i did i did one i didn't want and i got i think i guessed arise as the first one and then i
[01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:44.520]   ended up getting like i like a rise i got five letters and then i ended up i ended up getting a
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:49.400]   second the only thing i get it in three i don't like about a rise is i've read somewhere i may be
[01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:54.520]   wrong but i've never seen it that they don't do plural words so ask no plurals no plurals so
[01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:59.960]   manes s is maybe not as good a letter as it would one would think because you're not gonna get
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:03.880]   oh right yeah that's a good point that's a good point just thinking
[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:10.120]   we spent way too much time i'm i'm i'm gonna start using audio from now on i'm stealing
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:16.520]   i'm totally i'm totally i'm solving today's hey you i like it ay-u-d-i-o
[01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:22.120]   that's just what is this guy getting out of this by the way nothing i mean i said he i know but
[01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:26.440]   except how long is it charging 30 bucks a month exactly except for i know
[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:32.440]   shouldn't he does like at least run his website through the google ad sense so that it's just like
[01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:36.440]   well there was another person i think who made an app and now they're donating not the guy who
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:41.320]   was charging much no and and he made it at five years ago like don't yeah he made the same he made
[01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:46.440]   an app called wordle like literally it's called wordle and he's donating all of the current like he
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:53.880]   just started spiking and so he reached out to this this guy and was like hey like uh i have this app
[01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:57.480]   like what what can we do can we work on something together and so they ended up donating
[01:14:57.480 --> 01:15:05.480]   all of the proceeds the profits to a literacy nonprofit which is really cool if i go to the
[01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:12.760]   root site power language dot co dot uk is he now it's just some guy josh it just it just rolls off

[01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:05.800]   um what the hell happened the pixel six i i mean great what is wrong with google
[01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:13.480]   i ask myself every day what the hell is wrong with google don't understand when when apple is
[01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:20.680]   absolutely killing it with both the hardware and software and by the way samsung also killing it
[01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:25.960]   with the the software updates on their phones have been like like clockwork and really good
[01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:32.120]   um but if i have google look at that i got a software update to install right now on my uh
[01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:36.920]   my same-selling flip look at that i'm telling you this you've been it i today yes and it probably
[01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:42.600]   was available on the first yeah this is leo doesn't check actually um i was just saying oh look the
[01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:46.520]   google january updates finally here and you said no it came out a couple of days ago but i'm getting
[01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:52.680]   that now too so i i did i waited for my review you know the pixel came out i think october i waited
[01:21:52.680 --> 01:21:58.680]   to do my review until i think december like mid-December in my review i said i love this phone
[01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:04.760]   love the camera things love the form of fact your battery life is great but software is nice but
[01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:09.960]   it had a lot of little bugs and you can't make phone calls um i never i didn't have that problem
[01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:14.680]   i didn't need i don't know but somebody had that issue yeah but i said also the fingerprint
[01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:20.520]   reader worked for me just fine but no that that is that is a very sore spot on this phone for me
[01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:26.760]   it's it's it's and there's no there's no face there's no face unlock no um but i said my review like look
[01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:33.800]   at the end of the day google's gonna fix this any day now so by the way january 14th before it was
[01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:38.440]   still a whole month and a half before this you know software update i ended up sideloading
[01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:43.960]   the software update that they came out with originally and it was quite easy to do but obviously
[01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:48.840]   the average person can't do it well and then they turned it off because people like you uh well
[01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:54.760]   so not a way around it you found a way around it just still wasn't buggy it was still a buggy
[01:22:54.760 --> 01:23:00.440]   so many people had problems with the december update especially with connectivity that they
[01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:06.360]   stopped it yeah they stopped the update yeah i did it right before that okay um and i never got that
[01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:12.760]   and i've never i honestly and this is weird and i'm i'm here channeling all the people i know with
[01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:17.240]   pixel sixes i've had nothing but great experiences of mine but it's weird that some people have
[01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:20.920]   great experiences fingerprint reader works for me the cameras are great i've never had connectivity
[01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:26.920]   issues or phone issues but so many people have and even that speaks to a problem right yeah it's
[01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:32.040]   shouldn't it this should this phone should be amazing it's it's google's baby they're a smart
[01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:36.280]   company with a lot of smart people working there and i just don't think they take their phone
[01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:43.080]   serious enough also can we talk about the fact that the pixel changes every single time every year
[01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:47.480]   it's like an entirely different phone built from the ground up yeah like how annoying is that like
[01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:52.520]   with the iPhone there's like it's it's evolved over 15 years or whatever however many years it's been
[01:23:52.520 --> 01:23:58.120]   around it's it's like pretty much the same exact slab of glass and metal that it started out as
[01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:04.680]   except like if you just put it on a magic or about this i am it really annoys me that like google just
[01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:10.920]   can't get anything right except search they're a one trick pony at this point women no women youtube
[01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:17.720]   youtube gmail and search youtube gmail and search gmail they nailed everything else
[01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:25.160]   it's like attention deficit disorder or you know my gelgan email just i just argue gmail got there
[01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:30.440]   first like i i don't i mean i don't know yeah like outlook is pretty darn good i don't know if you
[01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:35.240]   i use it for work like i use it's pretty amazing email i've ever used in my life but do you spark
[01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:43.320]   with gmail uh i use it with my own with cnet with your own server yeah oh no no cnet's like that's
[01:24:43.320 --> 01:24:47.800]   all lockdown i have to use that throughout look and outlook is actually pretty good i uh but yeah
[01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:52.920]   i use spark with my own my own sparks an app but you know it works with various email
[01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:57.240]   you're self-hosted you're saying yeah self-hosted you're not you don't have like a server in the
[01:24:57.240 --> 01:25:04.840]   basement no nobody i just i don't host it i i don't run i use fast mail for instance could you do
[01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:10.280]   that leo could you host like a pop email server we have a we had a sponsor yeah who makes a um
[01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:16.520]   really cool device that is an email server it works really well uh cool it's a hard
[01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:23.080]   message in that it's a hard technology problem because uh gmail for instance won't accept email
[01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:28.280]   sent from your ip address they go i don't know you're a server oh yeah the spamming would get
[01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:34.760]   this thing suspicious so the way they have to do this they support d mark and um you know uh the
[01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:40.440]   other authentication technologies but the way they do it is you route the email through a server
[01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:45.000]   it doesn't even look at your mail just as routing through ip addresses they preconditioned to work
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:50.280]   with email services so you need to do that it's a good it's a it's a kind of a nerd thing
[01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:53.640]   my domain host mind just through my domain host you don't know which was a
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:58.120]   twit sponsor a long time great fantastic covers on my all my my one other thing that
[01:25:58.120 --> 01:26:03.320]   one other thing that google did do they nailed is google photos but i will say i have a problem
[01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:08.680]   with that too because once they got you in there now they charge yeah well the charging is fine i
[01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:13.240]   don't mind paying because i i love what they do but here's the thing you used to be able to sync your
[01:26:13.240 --> 01:26:18.600]   google drive to an external web you know like a nasa server and you could have your google photos
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:23.400]   inside there and it would also sync now they've shut off that functionality so if you have photos
[01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:28.760]   and google photos the only way to get them out is to do that google takeout there's no way to like
[01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:34.680]   sync that yeah that's like a third party hard drive and sync it to a hard drive that's ridiculous
[01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:39.560]   i'm sorry it's it's absolutely not accepted but i will give i'll give them half a point for photos
[01:26:39.560 --> 01:26:47.400]   so youtube gmail search and half a point i better be careful which finger i used for that half a
[01:26:47.400 --> 01:26:52.760]   half a point for photos i think photos is actually pretty good but you know you could search for
[01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:57.560]   anything in there and find but they did a bad thing they bought pakasa for instance which
[01:26:57.560 --> 01:27:03.480]   everybody loved is a wonderful windows free windows snap seed too yeah and then they yeah
[01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:08.280]   destroyed it snap seeds still around that's okay um so but it's not i mean it's not the same as
[01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:13.080]   so mike algin who's a regular on our shows uh big remember he was a big google plus supporter
[01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:18.440]   he says out and out sunda patchi is a terrible ceo fair
[01:27:18.440 --> 01:27:27.240]   hmm i'll let Ashley touch that one i was gonna say that's a that's a bold claim because i mean i
[01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:32.520]   think that there are just i think that there are just a lot of people making maybe not great
[01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:37.240]   just but that's his company he runs the free company is he a visionary just he ever does
[01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:42.200]   see this is my see this is like my argument right where it's like even even apple i think has this
[01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:47.880]   problem where it's like at the top like it like tim cook is not a visionary he's he's a he's a guy
[01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:53.240]   who came up through smart guy he's a really smart guy but he's not a visionary and like and i don't
[01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:59.080]   i don't argue that company i mean okay maybe he's not inventing the next ipad or i phone like he is
[01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:04.200]   really i think he's done the basic job of that company done an amazing job like no arguments
[01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:08.920]   and maybe the best the smartest thing to do is just to keep the the lights on in the wheels
[01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:13.160]   running because they had a fly role was going great so right why messes you say and i i also
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:19.960]   argue that like you could not have put somebody like a johnny i've ever you know i think apple got
[01:28:19.960 --> 01:28:26.120]   better when johnny left yeah i was a day i i i argue you could not have put somebody yeah you could not
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:31.320]   have put somebody in that role after steve died just by proxy have there would have been too many
[01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:36.840]   comparisons i went by by making it tim cook it was very easy for them to just sort of be like well
[01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:42.680]   i'm nothing like him like and it that just that was the end of that comment he said he said steve
[01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:49.400]   told him on his deathbed you should not be asking what steve would do you need to be your own guy
[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:55.960]   you need to run this company but honestly he's been a caretaker uh yeah i sonar pachai is a
[01:28:55.960 --> 01:29:02.040]   very nice guy uh i really liked him he's smart i don't think he's a leader and i think that's the
[01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:06.680]   problem is that you have a headless operation and everybody's doing their own thing that happened
[01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:11.960]   at microsoft let's let's not forget the days at microsoft when every division was sniping at every
[01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:16.280]   other division and you couldn't make windows good because the office division said that'll be bad
[01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:21.160]   for us and and and who comes along but such in adela and i think everybody would agree he's the
[01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:26.840]   opposite of sundar pachai he took a company transformed it pivoted it and has done a brilliant
[01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:31.640]   brilliant job yeah yeah he's done a good job he's done a good job very done a very good job and i
[01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:37.160]   i just i argue that like i it's like i think that he's sundar is really smart i just don't know that
[01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:43.320]   he's the guy to run google can we also get back to why the pixel is a is a heap of trash this year
[01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:50.120]   i tell you what sundar pachai that's why sundar pachai i would listen i would listen to you rich talk
[01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:55.320]   about this all day by the way have you tried to hold this thing in your hand how big it is big i
[01:29:55.320 --> 01:30:01.480]   like a big phone i get i know this is too big no it's too and they do it so if they if they have
[01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:05.320]   three if they have how tall are you rich it's great how tall are you rich it's six feet i have big
[01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:09.640]   hands i've got big feet and you think i'm a little guy and it fits my hands just fine what are you
[01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:14.680]   talking about oh i got a little bigger than that phone compared to the pro max like how much bigger
[01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:19.400]   is it uh side by side feels better in your hand because it's got two cases where edges and it's
[01:30:19.400 --> 01:30:24.360]   not rounded that's it look yeah google just hire me to make the next picture i will make this phone
[01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:30.760]   the best selling phone i i kind of this is a beautiful phone here it is side by side it's the
[01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:36.360]   same size it's very close you can hold the iphone easier because the edges don't go off to the you
[01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:40.920]   know they don't go the rounded screen people have the rounded around screen it's a it's a nightmare
[01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:44.920]   typing you try to type of two fingers on it you're messing up the entire time you have to go to voice
[01:30:44.920 --> 01:30:49.320]   don't you put a case on it all everybody should just have a case yes but it's still tough to use i'm
[01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:55.480]   telling you i test every single phone out there and the pixel is the phone i lost mark has brownly
[01:30:55.480 --> 01:31:00.440]   who also tests every phone i announced this week he said i'm finally taking the sim out of my pixel
[01:31:00.440 --> 01:31:06.680]   six putting in a samsung s 21 ultra the pixels is just too unreliable and he put it right back in
[01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:11.400]   the pixel as soon as that software update came out so believe me i did he put it in the s 21 ultra
[01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:16.360]   for like two minutes oh you kidding i didn't see the update he went back to the pixel six of course
[01:31:16.360 --> 01:31:23.000]   he's a pixel guy he's a pixel guy he used the s 21 ultra until he needed to you know to just to
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:27.080]   get through to the pixel and then he went back he made this big tweet and then google came out
[01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:32.040]   with the update literally 38 hours after his tweet oh i didn't know that oh that's his story oh yeah
[01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:36.520]   now i i can't confirm that he put his sim back in the pixel but i'm pretty sure he's back to the
[01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:41.800]   pixel because um look the pixel you can't deny the photos that come off the thing are amazing
[01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:45.960]   the software the way it integrates google services whenever i use it i sit there and i
[01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:50.680]   realize all the little things that no i far prefer vanilla android yeah i far prefer it
[01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:58.200]   um gosh you know but i'm with you i'm using the experience with the iphone as much as i want the
[01:31:58.200 --> 01:32:04.680]   i don't like the walled garden is a much more consistent reliable experience it's always a lie
[01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:10.840]   like serie every year is consistently bad stupid yeah yeah no i'm gonna get like no serious
[01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:15.480]   serious like i know it's gonna be a voice attack son iphone is getting to be laughably
[01:32:15.480 --> 01:32:20.520]   horrible because it doesn't like google let me give you one example of google how they do
[01:32:20.520 --> 01:32:25.480]   voice detect so if you're standing in front of a restaurant that has a specific name and you say
[01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:31.080]   hey meet me at uh you know john's restaurant right yeah google knows from your location when you're
[01:32:31.080 --> 01:32:35.400]   using voice that you are in front of that restaurant it says oh they mean john's restaurant right here
[01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:40.200]   right i'm not kidding when i say meet me at whatever it'll be like navigating to Las Vegas or
[01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:44.840]   john's restaurant must make no i'm standing in front of this restaurant because serie doesn't
[01:32:44.840 --> 01:32:49.000]   use those cues that apple that google does serie can't just like that
[01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:54.920]   apples respect in your privacy right doesn't have the information to do that did you see did you
[01:32:54.920 --> 01:33:01.080]   guys see the the thing about um the reason why the iphone keyboard the autocorrect has been so
[01:33:01.080 --> 01:33:07.160]   or the predictive is so bad no have you seen this yes i have but it has been passed christina
[01:33:07.160 --> 01:33:16.520]   please christina please at the size everything why is the iphone keyboard so bad what is happening
[01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:21.880]   here they've they've they've been taking um they've been like crowdsourcing it they've been like
[01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:26.200]   taking everybody else's type yes they've been like what type of what
[01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:33.960]   they've done like a grammarly it's it's terrible so basically all the the terrible ways oh they're
[01:33:33.960 --> 01:33:40.280]   using in other words they're using my corrections and adding it to the database not just locally but
[01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:46.920]   to the everybody else is using yeah um they're crowdsourcing the autocorrect i thought apple doesn't
[01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:55.880]   do stuff like that so okay so this is a tweet that i saw i've been sending this to friends because
[01:33:55.880 --> 01:34:00.520]   they've been complaining about me uh or complaining about the text messages for probably complaining
[01:34:00.520 --> 01:34:08.120]   about me too but um this is from uh steve trotton smith who is expert on this stuff yep yep he says
[01:34:08.120 --> 01:34:13.480]   apple really this was on uh the ninth of december so this is last month okay i missed this apple
[01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:18.600]   apple really needs to throw out its crowdsourced machine learned autocorrect system entirely
[01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:24.440]   autocorrect used to learn from everything i typed now it interjects with typos and weirdisms
[01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:30.440]   from random internet users it's been a complete train wreck since they introduced this stuff yep
[01:34:30.440 --> 01:34:38.280]   that makes sense because people would say why would it replace that word with this word why would i
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:42.920]   ever want to tell every time i say hold on i say let me try that for a sec it always
[01:34:42.920 --> 01:34:46.840]   changes to sex so are people talking about sex on their phones is that what's happening
[01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:51.880]   internet certainly on the internet like absolutely yeah no but this is every time
[01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:56.200]   have you ever tried to send a business text to someone and it like changes the word of the last
[01:34:56.200 --> 01:35:01.320]   second and you're like oh no yeah if it's the last word you're right yeah every like yes
[01:35:01.320 --> 01:35:06.280]   this is the most annoying thing and also it's it and also it just has no context like that that's
[01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:12.120]   what i'm saying that's what i'm saying i'm not kidding why would i write actually
[01:35:12.840 --> 01:35:19.560]   hell why would i write hell go tomorrow no he'll go tomorrow like apple this is not hard
[01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:24.600]   no it's not don't get me started on proper name any proper names anything that is like a
[01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:30.440]   and it's i mean just try the bad little voice to text for literally uh three days
[01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:35.000]   and you will not believe you forget how bad syria is because that's interesting you know most
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:38.360]   people aren't using it's one of the reasons one of the reasons one of the things i thought was
[01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:44.280]   really cool about syria is the automatic captioning of anything you're watching or listening to if
[01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:50.600]   you turn that on and it's i think it's very very good well that's all it is yeah the pixel yeah
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:56.680]   okay sorry yeah you you said syria yeah no the pixel sorry the pixel is really good
[01:35:56.680 --> 01:36:01.240]   yeah i was gonna say i was like google google i'm talking about it you're trying to learn a new
[01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:05.720]   language from syria oh my yeah people watch with closed captions oh no you'll get right accidentally
[01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:10.360]   you so why is tim cook such a crappy ceo no i'm sorry that was the wrong
[01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:14.360]   no no what's what's funny those you mentioned like the voice of text stuff what's this is what i
[01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:18.600]   thought you were talking about leo but it's different so if you use the actual built-in like um
[01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:23.480]   dictation like dictation on the iphone that's fantastic yeah i use that all the time i very rarely
[01:36:23.480 --> 01:36:28.360]   type text messages yeah that one is absolutely amazing because it's completely different
[01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:36.040]   for syria dictionary so syria is the garbage but but the the um dictation stuff is great when um
[01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:42.280]   when i was in the accident a few years ago and i couldn't use my right arm um and and i i was
[01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:48.280]   having a hard time even typing like i was doing a ton of voice to text stuff and it was amazing i
[01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:54.120]   still do it all the time i do it like car okay so using carway is different when i say send a text
[01:36:54.120 --> 01:36:58.920]   and it does that that's different from actually typing on the keyboard oh that makes a lot of sense
[01:36:58.920 --> 01:37:05.880]   then okay well i guess i'm using syria then when when i i take it all back syria when i'm using car
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:12.440]   play in my car i get a text i say i press up or thing and it'll read it to me and then says do you
[01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:18.280]   want to reply i think that syria and then i dictate it and it but it's always very very good oh actually
[01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:23.000]   you'll love this i'm confused so when i when i say call my wife's name is lindsey i say call
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:27.400]   lindsey and i would think my phone my iphone after 10 years of saying lindsey it should know right it
[01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:34.200]   should know my wife it should know after like it calls lindsey turntine oh my god it doesn't even
[01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:41.080]   augerly the choice no it's just like calling lindsey turntine i'm like uh no like i corrected every
[01:37:41.080 --> 01:37:48.840]   time you would think that syria would learn like my my syria this is my favorite syria story whenever
[01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:56.520]   i tell a tell syria to call uh my sister-in-law her last name is dameetio and uh also a lovely
[01:37:56.520 --> 01:37:59.320]   Italian name well now it's my brother's last name because they got married sounds like she's in my
[01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:07.320]   family but um sh every time it's like it it literally writes out calling like her first name
[01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:18.120]   the meat CEO like in what universe would that be a thing did you see well if you were the
[01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:25.160]   ceo of dominoes maybe like you know and i'm meat ceo of meat like in a tangent lam related story

[01:44:31.160 --> 01:44:36.920]   that was one of the early forms of griefing i remember about second life yeah was that they
[01:44:36.920 --> 01:44:42.520]   called it griefing and have those things raining fallacies don't show me you're raining fallice

[01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:41.480]   consulates in second life my aunt who worked at the cdc like they were trying to do something in
[01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:45.400]   second life i remember that because i remember her asking me about it and i was like this is a really
[01:45:45.400 --> 01:45:50.680]   weird thing for like what a virus work in second life well but they would do like well make me
[01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:54.200]   well because i thought that it was going to be the digital meeting space they thought people were
[01:45:54.200 --> 01:45:57.480]   actually going to congregate there to learn about things like they thought it was going to be the
[01:45:57.480 --> 01:46:01.160]   same stuff that people tell us the metaverse is going to be which i i don't believe any of this
[01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:04.760]   is ever going to be a thing to be completely can't what oh my god people congregate it's
[01:46:04.760 --> 01:46:09.720]   there but i'll say it right now people congregate it wasn't to learn about stuff right that's what i
[01:46:09.720 --> 01:46:14.760]   mean like towards the end yeah actually and it's still around so i don't maybe yeah but towards
[01:46:14.760 --> 01:46:18.440]   where's it started at the end of its popularity yeah as it started to generate you could buy
[01:46:19.160 --> 01:46:25.320]   different outfits including nude suits so that he would look like you were naked and then they were
[01:46:25.320 --> 01:46:29.160]   just struggling towards the end yeah and it would be like oh no come on sext is going to take over
[01:46:29.160 --> 01:46:34.120]   from the beginning it would like always these things the part industry always drives technology
[01:46:34.120 --> 01:46:39.880]   we know 100 percent but can you imagine a worse experience than kind of a clunky avatar dressed
[01:46:39.880 --> 01:46:48.360]   in a nude suit and you're not you're just i mean like much fun i mean the sims is probably one the
[01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:52.680]   most enduring franchises again the last one years okay and there's a ton of sims mods and
[01:46:52.680 --> 01:46:57.080]   and the sims is still great sims four hasn't when did that come out actually like seven years ago
[01:46:57.080 --> 01:47:02.280]   i mean it might even be more now time might be more than that i don't have any concept of time
[01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:07.880]   anymore so could be 10 so you know right so the sims is still insanely popular that the modding
[01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:14.440]   community of that is huge uh second life was just like okay so sims is teenage girls and like second
[01:47:14.440 --> 01:47:21.480]   life was men in their 40s do you want to make a metaverse uh the sims all you need to do is just
[01:47:21.480 --> 01:47:27.480]   make the sims like honestly totally totally we didn't double-digit double-digit double-digit
[01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:33.080]   worker they better i think everybody should only speak in simlish if you're in i i i would totally
[01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:40.680]   just speak in simlish 100 only i would never speak in the language and my my hunger gauge my
[01:47:40.680 --> 01:47:46.520]   angry gauge would be mostly full yes and my hunger gauge would be like mostly empty so
[01:47:46.520 --> 01:47:52.440]   so it's interesting because uh rich wants to be in the metaverse he can't wait he's dying to put on
[01:47:52.440 --> 01:47:58.200]   the helmet uh kristina thinks it's never going to even happen and you work for microsoft which has
[01:47:58.200 --> 01:48:03.720]   the closest thing we've got which is the hollow lens and that thing they did the didn't they do
[01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:08.360]   like the meeting rooms or something like what what they called i don't remember but like the the
[01:48:08.360 --> 01:48:15.480]   team's thing yeah i saw it and i just give you my burning man thing and where i think this is where
[01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:20.360]   i see just just one little thing that i think is going to be huge okay so you know how you're
[01:48:20.360 --> 01:48:24.600]   researching like a hotel for like a resort you want to stay at right like somewhere exotic
[01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:29.400]   what do you do you flip through trip advisor you're looking at pictures it's like the worst pictures
[01:48:29.400 --> 01:48:33.880]   you've ever seen of that hotel it's like if you want to see one room like of the hotel they take
[01:48:33.880 --> 01:48:37.320]   a picture from like the worst angle of the room and you're like wait that doesn't show me anything
[01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:43.880]   so my idea just one small part of the metaverse is going to be hilton hotels mariot hotels every
[01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:49.640]   hotel is going to be mapped virtual for vr and you just put on your you know your oculus and you
[01:48:49.640 --> 01:48:55.160]   just walk into the hotel and see what it looks like you see the view you can walk upstairs see what
[01:48:55.160 --> 01:49:00.120]   the room looks like you kind of hear that now i mean there's 3d uh yeah yeah 360 images
[01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:05.240]   no but no but i no but i'm into this i uh i had a when i when we were allowed to travel i had a
[01:49:05.240 --> 01:49:09.800]   fairly popular instagram stories thing that i would do of christina's hotel tours where i would
[01:49:09.800 --> 01:49:14.040]   just tour the hotel rooms i would go into those are more popular i probably one of the things i've
[01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:18.120]   ever done shockingly like i have people who didn't even know me from other ways i was like oh i love
[01:49:18.120 --> 01:49:23.400]   your hotel tours i'm like there every before i was you know you do your own and then you walk around
[01:49:23.400 --> 01:49:27.080]   and show the lobby and all that is that what you would do i know i i would basically just walk into
[01:49:27.080 --> 01:49:31.480]   the room i would do like a tour of what what things were like and kind of show the whole thing and
[01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:36.120]   give my my thoughts on on where it was i don't know why people liked it but they did so it was just
[01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:41.480]   quite like i think right i mean people i would watch that it like before i were booking a place i
[01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:45.240]   would like to know what it actually looks like if i could have if i would strap on a VR helmet to
[01:49:45.240 --> 01:49:50.520]   like find out is the room i'm going to be in actually going to be in i would do that imagine walking
[01:49:50.520 --> 01:49:54.200]   through it though but i'm saying like no but what about walking through you know you want to walk
[01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:59.560]   the cobblestone streets of paris before you visit i mean this and yes there are ways of doing this
[01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:06.440]   but the metabolism and stuff i think it's clear it's just not that when it's all together and it's
[01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:11.960]   like but it won't be whatever has the killer app for walking through cities it won't be fragmented
[01:50:11.960 --> 01:50:15.960]   but it's going to be a thing that you can do right but that's not a matter verse but then it's not a
[01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:20.360]   matter verse that's my art well what do you how do you define what the metaverse is i guess so okay
[01:50:20.360 --> 01:50:25.000]   so facebook facebook's vision of a metaverse since we're so this is the reason we're all talking
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:30.200]   about it now is that you know they're going to provide the sort of framework for everybody
[01:50:30.200 --> 01:50:36.280]   to build their own thing that is all interconnected interop uh and that you're going to be able to
[01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:41.160]   kind of like go seamlessly from one thing to the next like in a in a perfect metaverse but they
[01:50:41.160 --> 01:50:47.160]   provide the framework correct provide the framework and here's the problem that's we're already seeing
[01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:54.920]   that the FTC is already investigating that they we've there there's there have been news stories
[01:50:54.920 --> 01:51:01.320]   about the FTC investigating facebook's acquisitions of all of these little VR companies little AR
[01:51:01.320 --> 01:51:06.760]   companies because they're trying to once again just like they did before you know they started
[01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:10.600]   getting in trouble just like they did with what's happened instagram they're trying to snap up
[01:51:10.600 --> 01:51:17.560]   and kill all the oxygen in the room all competitors so that they can be the monolith and i don't think
[01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:22.360]   the FTC is going to let that happen again like i just don't and i don't i agree i don't i don't
[01:51:22.360 --> 01:51:27.400]   think it's facebook controlling this thing no no but i that's what i'm saying it's like it can't be a
[01:51:27.400 --> 01:51:32.200]   metaverse like in the traditional sense of the way that we're presented with it in books like
[01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:39.640]   snow crash where it originated like we it's a it's a fully operational you know matrix basically it's
[01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:45.320]   the matrix and so i argue that we will never see that because companies are too greedy no one is
[01:51:45.320 --> 01:51:49.800]   going to want to share their experience that they feel it's really amazing they want to own the
[01:51:49.800 --> 01:51:54.520]   platform and so we're just never they're all going to fight with each other this is the fran
[01:51:54.520 --> 01:51:59.640]   these are the real franchise wars in demolition man it's not the fast food ones it's this it's
[01:51:59.640 --> 01:52:04.920]   this right here do you think we would be fighting about it talking about this or at all interest in
[01:52:04.920 --> 01:52:12.280]   this if it weren't for covid and climate change and wildfires and earthquakes and tornadoes and volcanoes
[01:52:12.280 --> 01:52:19.080]   and tsunamis do you think it's it's really we want to retreat from this and we want i think so yeah i
[01:52:19.080 --> 01:52:24.840]   think so i think i think it's an actual evolution yeah didn't we all when we i remember when i was
[01:52:24.840 --> 01:52:30.360]   what 12 years old at the l_a_ county fair paying 20 dollars to strap on a headset and stand at a
[01:52:30.360 --> 01:52:37.560]   little ring and spend 15 minutes walking around in blocks literally just like polygon and the amount
[01:52:37.560 --> 01:52:44.440]   of people that got oculus over the holidays is is unbelievable it was the number one app installed
[01:52:44.440 --> 01:52:50.600]   on iPhones over christmas i don't think sales numbers but they are selling this thing like crazy
[01:52:50.600 --> 01:52:55.240]   and i have people come up to me like rich this is unbelievable and yes vr is very tough to cover
[01:52:55.240 --> 01:53:01.160]   for tv because it's like you just get this thing of like aah but like the reality is every single
[01:53:01.160 --> 01:53:08.280]   story i've done with vr that where i see stuff and i'm in this world and i it is it is so amazing and
[01:53:08.280 --> 01:53:13.240]   we're just at the beginning so like i said that one little app that i had is just one thing but like
[01:53:13.240 --> 01:53:17.480]   imagine on a friday night you can just walk into a bar and sit there with your friends in like
[01:53:17.480 --> 01:53:22.040]   you're in different places and i get it we still want to do this stuff in person but the reality is
[01:53:22.040 --> 01:53:26.680]   not everyone wants to do that in person and not everyone's there's going to be another place to
[01:53:26.680 --> 01:53:31.320]   do that like it's just going to complement our real world not everyone can exactly
[01:53:31.320 --> 01:53:39.640]   yeah oculus was downloaded 1.3 million times globally between december 21st and 27th of 363
[01:53:39.640 --> 01:53:45.880]   percent increase uh clearly the big gift of four people in my family yeah it was a huge gift
[01:53:45.880 --> 01:53:50.520]   this year this holiday it was wild yeah i heard from a ton of people who got it it got it for people
[01:53:50.520 --> 01:53:54.600]   but it was because of covid-19 right it's because we've been in lockdown we're all trapped yeah we're
[01:53:54.600 --> 01:53:58.840]   trapped i think it was also the yeah it was the right time and it's also the right price i think
[01:53:58.840 --> 01:54:03.640]   the price came down to a point where people said okay and it doesn't require like other equipment
[01:54:03.640 --> 01:54:07.800]   but instead they're just like all right but to your point you have to have a facebook account to
[01:54:07.800 --> 01:54:12.920]   use it i mean it really is which is why i don't have one yeah i mean either it's talk about lockin
[01:54:12.920 --> 01:54:18.120]   i i don't have a facebook account and i'm not going to set one up just to use oculus and by the way
[01:54:18.120 --> 01:54:22.840]   if you fake it if you make a fake account and they catch you you're banned from oculus yeah you're
[01:54:22.840 --> 01:54:26.440]   banned from oculus so i just need an apple account to use i message
[01:54:26.440 --> 01:54:33.800]   no i know it's all about platform lockin um and and it's all about dystopia because if it
[01:54:33.800 --> 01:54:38.920]   weren't for dystopia every single i've pointed out of this before it every single example of the
[01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:44.680]   metaverse whether it's snow crash or ready player one or a cyber it's all bad it's a
[01:54:44.680 --> 01:54:49.880]   neuro necromance or it's always a dystopia that people are trying to escape from yeah it's always
[01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:54.680]   a nightmare scenario you don't want to live in that world so you go to this fake world which
[01:54:54.680 --> 01:55:00.920]   i think we're years from it being even close to look every single time they talk about it
[01:55:00.920 --> 01:55:06.120]   you have to have some way of simulating touch and smell and movement look at that crazy
[01:55:06.120 --> 01:55:12.600]   thing they have a ready player one so that he can run that right come on but you think about like um
[01:55:12.600 --> 01:55:17.320]   how it sounds coming out with that i wouldn't be surprised like if you look at something like
[01:55:17.320 --> 01:55:23.400]   gaming like you look at you know it's it's 2022 in 2000 we were you know we're we're
[01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:30.280]   playing dreamcast games and nintendo and we were happy and we were happy but i think about how far
[01:55:30.280 --> 01:55:37.000]   we've come in that time that's a very short amount of time in in the way of innovation and i argue
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:43.080]   that like my kid in 20 years like i can't even interrupt my brain about what he's playing as
[01:55:43.080 --> 01:55:46.920]   games will be much more vivid although yeah you know if you think about it why did you
[01:55:46.920 --> 01:55:51.560]   keep playing animal crossing it's not the most vivid experience not the highest resolution
[01:55:51.560 --> 01:55:56.120]   screen that's in the switch but you but you know because it comes down to the game ultimately it
[01:55:56.120 --> 01:56:00.280]   comes down to the game but just you know when you can when you can i think that the good
[01:56:00.280 --> 01:56:08.120]   guy the mind is a better vr helmet than anything anybody can make your imagination but but doesn't
[01:56:08.120 --> 01:56:14.120]   not what powers vr it's like your it's like your senses are tricked in this system exactly these
[01:56:14.120 --> 01:56:19.080]   i would submit that actually you you would be better off if you gave less signals to your
[01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:23.400]   mind and you'll let your mind do it then if you kind of gave it these concrete crappy signals
[01:56:23.400 --> 01:56:29.320]   from a vr helmet well maybe we just open a book breaking news and just you know imagine
[01:56:29.320 --> 01:56:34.920]   lee ole for endorses microdosing oh hey you know what if you can actually have been looking
[01:56:34.920 --> 01:56:41.080]   for a way to get some is that legal by the way it's not legal i don't i don't know
[01:56:42.520 --> 01:56:51.560]   actually you're an expert on all things drugs is that you clearly as the uh magic mushroom
[01:56:51.560 --> 01:56:57.560]   expert on the panel uh please tell us what are you mixing behind you in that lab i don't i just
[01:56:57.560 --> 01:57:02.760]   feel like i want to i feel like it's time for me to microdose what could possibly go for
[01:57:02.760 --> 01:57:09.080]   me you know what leo i fully i fully support this i need to every level on every level i have to
[01:57:09.080 --> 01:57:13.640]   there are a lot of startups working on this full confession it's a thing full confession and when
[01:57:13.640 --> 01:57:21.000]   i was a young guy breaking into e3 when i was a younger person i took a lot of psychedelics
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:25.160]   enjoyed them quite a lot but of course as a normal adult i immediately cut all that i don't
[01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:29.480]   even i don't want to smoke pot i don't want to lose one brain cell and yet for some reason the
[01:57:29.480 --> 01:57:35.480]   idea of microdosing sounds appealing like i get up in the morning have a cup of coffee and 20 microgams
[01:57:35.480 --> 01:57:40.600]   of lsd i think it would be good huxley was was brilliant i don't know i mean look i can't argue
[01:57:40.600 --> 01:57:45.560]   with this i did i did i did i did i did i did i did all this huxley i know he took acid did he microdose
[01:57:45.560 --> 01:57:50.200]   or did he think that he took the full bloke board thing it didn't tell that stuff you don't want
[01:57:50.200 --> 01:57:55.080]   that yeah i mean i mean he he he experimented with all the different things we're going down a very
[01:57:55.080 --> 01:58:00.440]   bad road here i have to stop right now you but you you i mean i'm i'm i'm i'm with ashley i'm very
[01:58:00.440 --> 01:58:04.520]   here for you doing this and you can get a guide get somebody to like watch oh i don't need a guide
[01:58:04.520 --> 01:58:10.120]   i said one hundred percent yeah leo's been there leo's been all the way i've been there i've been there
[01:58:10.120 --> 01:58:14.200]   i've been your guide that's right i'll be your guide you will be the guide in the metaverse for
[01:58:14.200 --> 01:58:19.240]   microdosing yeah confine oh my god okay so see that would actually take your little mushroom tree
[01:58:19.240 --> 01:58:23.560]   that you live under you'll be like okay see now you made me actually like the micro like the
[01:58:23.560 --> 01:58:29.560]   metaverse because the now the concept of a bunch of people like tripping parts in the microverse
[01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:35.320]   but the microverse but it's the first kind of a i like the microverse can we call it the microverse
[01:58:35.320 --> 01:58:46.600]   i'm gonna go buy microverse calm all right let's take a break you guys is good i'm having way
[01:58:46.600 --> 01:58:52.760]   too much fun who needs who needs microdosing when i've got christina warren rich tomorrow ashley
[01:58:52.760 --> 01:58:59.800]   esketha fabulous panel really really lots of fun our show today brought to you by worldwide

[02:02:05.080 --> 02:02:14.440]   ignore web 3. The problem with this whole thing the idea of rebuilding the web based on nft's
[02:02:14.440 --> 02:02:20.280]   blockchains cryptocurrency etc etc is that it's fundamentally incompatible with human nature.
[02:02:20.280 --> 02:02:26.600]   All about android we really know that sam song has been kind of doing gangbusters in the large
[02:02:26.600 --> 02:02:33.080]   meaningful devices with our foals and our flips well at ces 2022 we've got a they've got a more
[02:02:33.080 --> 02:02:37.960]   form factors for us that are pretty interesting i gotta tell you all of these take foldable to
[02:02:37.960 --> 02:02:46.440]   like the next level and like bravo sam song. Mac break weekly the la police officers when

[02:02:52.040 --> 02:02:57.160]   mall are still fired they were charged with one failing to respond to a robbery in progress
[02:02:57.160 --> 02:03:01.880]   called to making misleading statements to their sergeant pre failing to respond on the radio for

[02:03:25.720 --> 02:03:30.440]   the twit plus feed if you are not a member of club twit i i do want to remind everybody there's a
[02:03:30.440 --> 02:03:34.920]   great way to support what we do seven bucks a month you get ad-free versions of all the shows we figure
[02:03:34.920 --> 02:03:39.240]   you've given us money we don't need to use the ads to monetize so you get ad-free versions of all
[02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:45.320]   of our shows you also get access to our club twit discord which is always a great great time
[02:03:45.320 --> 02:03:50.120]   that has become more than just a place to chat while the shows are going on we've got a whole
[02:03:50.120 --> 02:03:57.400]   community going in every area of of geekitude and then the twit plus feed stacy's book club is in
[02:03:57.400 --> 02:04:01.560]   the discord becomes part of the twit plus feed we have an untitled linux show the gizfiz
[02:04:01.560 --> 02:04:05.880]   and soon watch we will uh we figured that this is the best way to launch new shows
[02:04:05.880 --> 02:04:09.800]   we've got a new show we're working on we're very excited about which we'll premiere first
[02:04:09.800 --> 02:04:14.040]   in the club twit discord and on the twit plus feed so if you're not a member of the club
[02:04:14.040 --> 02:04:20.600]   here's a great way to kind of get inside twit go to twit.tv/club twit seven bucks a month small amount of
[02:04:20.600 --> 02:04:26.360]   money it really helps us really supports what we do and i think there's some really good benefits
[02:04:26.360 --> 02:04:32.840]   that go along with it all right and yes we do have business accounts we a number of companies now
[02:04:32.840 --> 02:04:37.960]   bought business accounts there's that's all that information is on the page back to the show
[02:04:37.960 --> 02:04:47.880]   worldwide pc shipments up big time 27 percent over 2019 last year 15 percent over 2021 i mean over
[02:04:47.880 --> 02:05:01.320]   2020 341 million pc sold in 2021 what wow what uh the big pc makers number one lonovo
[02:05:01.320 --> 02:05:07.960]   hp number two del and then apple apple had the biggest growth year over year apple now has
[02:05:07.960 --> 02:05:12.440]   eight and a half percent market share i have to think the new m1 processors probably helped with
[02:05:12.440 --> 02:05:17.160]   that and i can obviously work from home is is the driver here although it's interesting that
[02:05:17.160 --> 02:05:25.720]   pc sales were up in 2021 2020 yeah well okay so so we think about it you had like the you had the
[02:05:25.720 --> 02:05:32.280]   m1 that really came out like the end of 2020 so that drove into the entire year um and and these
[02:05:32.280 --> 02:05:36.520]   are our big deal because for a lot of us back users you know we haven't had good laptops from
[02:05:36.520 --> 02:05:41.400]   apple in years and and certainly there was probably pent up to man i bet yeah yeah i think so but
[02:05:41.400 --> 02:05:46.040]   then you also had like kind of the coalescence of um you know kind of the the thirst everybody
[02:05:46.040 --> 02:05:51.160]   wanted a graphics card the rise of pc gaming because people couldn't get you know or even if people
[02:05:51.160 --> 02:05:56.680]   could get the newer consoles you know pc gaming has had is really having a moment the the rise in
[02:05:56.680 --> 02:06:01.880]   processors again you know fourth quarter of 2020 probably you know leading into 2021
[02:06:01.880 --> 02:06:08.680]   bigger mobile chip improvement so i think there's probably i think we'll probably be gaming work
[02:06:08.680 --> 02:06:13.720]   from home and and pent up demand but that's my take i i could also just be fomo right like you
[02:06:13.720 --> 02:06:17.400]   can't get a processor you can't get a chips everybody wants it you know what i mean i know
[02:06:17.400 --> 02:06:22.360]   you're talking you are crazy you're talking in the chat room sharing your techniques
[02:06:22.360 --> 02:06:28.440]   for getting an Nvidia graphics card yeah what is the deal there what are you buying them for
[02:06:28.440 --> 02:06:33.480]   friends i have i haven't i haven't in months because it's been very difficult to to be completely
[02:06:33.480 --> 02:06:39.880]   candid like at this point uh to try to get a graphics card is so hard um still yeah it's it's
[02:06:39.880 --> 02:06:45.000]   gotten worse actually there's a line the usual methods that you could do that actually and i
[02:06:45.000 --> 02:06:50.520]   used when we were building our rigs like our our over um and you used to just be able to tell
[02:06:50.520 --> 02:06:56.280]   people follow certain discord's have notifications on on twitter and whatnot yeah that's all gone um
[02:06:56.280 --> 02:07:01.480]   and it's what's the hot card everybody wants these days of 30 90 or 30 80s whatever it wants
[02:07:01.480 --> 02:07:06.600]   yeah the 30 80 is really like that's what i have the way i got it was i bought it from alien
[02:07:06.600 --> 02:07:10.040]   wear and i figured well they're gonna have enough so i was able to get in a couple of months get
[02:07:10.040 --> 02:07:15.800]   a uh 8 AMD right i know a lot of people who have bought pre-builts because it was the only way the
[02:07:15.800 --> 02:07:20.440]   only way i could get me too but the problem is even with pre-built is that the companies have
[02:07:20.440 --> 02:07:24.200]   learned that people are just buying them for the card and so they've either raised the price or
[02:07:24.200 --> 02:07:29.560]   they've changed the config of the package so it's not as good so you have to be careful in terms of
[02:07:29.560 --> 02:07:35.640]   what pre-built you get because it used to be you could say okay well if i spend 1600 on this pre-built
[02:07:35.640 --> 02:07:40.840]   but it has the card i want fine now a you're not going to be spending 1600 to get that card
[02:07:40.840 --> 02:07:47.000]   and be like the the rest of what you get might not be worth it so if somebody wants a 30 90 which is
[02:07:47.000 --> 02:07:51.640]   their most expensive card other well they just count with 30 90 ti but if somebody wants their
[02:07:51.640 --> 02:07:56.360]   most expensive card unfortunately at this point my advice is you're gonna you're gonna pay the
[02:07:56.360 --> 02:08:02.440]   scalper one way or another fine like jeez really are just enter the new egg shuffle literally
[02:08:02.440 --> 02:08:07.320]   every time and cross yours and the problem the shuffle that friends hit the shuffle i have to
[02:08:07.320 --> 02:08:11.640]   but and i i've i've hit the shuffle the problem the shuffle is many times they will make you get a
[02:08:11.640 --> 02:08:17.800]   bundle of stuff that then you don't want so you have to so so either way you're paying right so i mean
[02:08:17.800 --> 02:08:24.280]   yeah what's the new egg shuffle i don't i'm sorry i'm sorry oh sorry is there a little Oscar Isaac is
[02:08:24.280 --> 02:08:29.480]   there is he having no no it's a raffle so every every day or every couple of days new egg has a number
[02:08:29.480 --> 02:08:34.920]   of products that they make available for people to get the opportunity to buy at random so you sign
[02:08:34.920 --> 02:08:39.640]   up you have to beg yeah you you will you just tell them these are the products i would like to buy
[02:08:39.640 --> 02:08:43.160]   then you'll get an email if you get the email it's not guaranteed that you'll get it it just means
[02:08:43.160 --> 02:08:47.800]   you have the opportunity to buy and then you need to like click on you know the the buy button as
[02:08:47.800 --> 02:08:52.440]   fast as possible sometimes they let you just get the product on its own but more often than not they
[02:08:52.440 --> 02:08:57.640]   have it bundled with something else like what like when i got my 30 80 which i got um a year ago i got
[02:08:57.640 --> 02:09:02.760]   it like at the end of january of twenty twenty one i was able to get it basically for a mrs p and
[02:09:02.760 --> 02:09:09.800]   them it came with a uh um power supply that wound up being recalled um so that was fun i didn't use
[02:09:09.800 --> 02:09:13.560]   the power supply fortunately but it was the one that blew up the gigabyte one that was catching on fire
[02:09:13.560 --> 02:09:20.440]   um so um i i paid you know about nine hundred dollars drive out for for the card on the power
[02:09:20.440 --> 02:09:26.840]   supply so which was huge because i couldn't get a 30 80 you know for for that price now you'd be
[02:09:26.840 --> 02:09:33.800]   lucky to get it for double lap rice um but but that was a year ago and now you know the whole thing
[02:09:33.800 --> 02:09:39.720]   is just much more difficult because supply is still constrained and um you know demand is even is
[02:09:39.720 --> 02:09:46.040]   even greater is this harder to get than sneakers now is this your new thing yeah ps5 but you know
[02:09:46.040 --> 02:09:51.240]   it's still harder to get than anything xbox series x or covid test one of the other yeah
[02:09:52.440 --> 02:09:58.920]   very good very good rich no i was gonna say you see that like all all the like warrios 64 and all
[02:09:58.920 --> 02:10:04.920]   the other like um console flangers like you can buy a covid test yes yeah they're all on there like
[02:10:04.920 --> 02:10:11.640]   now in stock wise wise cam was selling covid tests but they sold out yes the funny thing is six
[02:10:11.640 --> 02:10:15.640]   months ago when all these companies pitched me like when wise was like he rich we're selling uh you
[02:10:15.640 --> 02:10:19.640]   know covid tests like do you want to do a story i'm like no and then i health comes to me they're
[02:10:19.640 --> 02:10:24.040]   like we're doing covid test i'm like no you can get there i was making fun of them at the cvs they
[02:10:24.040 --> 02:10:28.680]   have them stacked up you know stacked up and now you can't get them anywhere yeah although i did
[02:10:28.680 --> 02:10:34.120]   get two shipments over the last couple days so i will say they if you order them online they do
[02:10:34.120 --> 02:10:39.560]   ship them out pretty quickly yeah you just order them preemptively like don't order don't need one
[02:10:39.560 --> 02:10:45.000]   you if you if you wait until you need one you've waited two and then you're screwed well so we had i
[02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:51.480]   got um like spoiled so um we have a clinic on campus at work and they would allow us like when you
[02:10:51.480 --> 02:10:56.680]   came in like you could get a free they would like give like the free you know bynax um i have a
[02:10:56.680 --> 02:11:00.760]   labs whatever like a covid test people and so if you went into the clinic if you could go in
[02:11:00.760 --> 02:11:04.200]   multiple times a week and i knew people who did i didn't but i would typically go in once a week
[02:11:04.200 --> 02:11:09.160]   and i would get like a free you know take home test or whatever well they they've run out so they had
[02:11:09.160 --> 02:11:13.800]   to send out a mass email to be like for this foreseeable future we will not have free covid tests
[02:11:13.800 --> 02:11:20.760]   available we were all very sad they weren't given out those bynax tests like candy at ces like i
[02:11:20.760 --> 02:11:24.680]   oh i'm not kidding they're and so my wife is like get as many as you can

[02:13:32.600 --> 02:13:40.200]   uh i you know i just did a video last month about on cnets youtube channel about uh microphones if
[02:13:40.200 --> 02:13:45.720]   you want to upgrade your streaming that's why you have such a nice microphone now i so the nice
[02:13:45.720 --> 02:13:51.880]   people at shore were kind enough to send me the sm7b as a as a test model and i did have to send
[02:13:51.880 --> 02:13:57.560]   it back but i i've never actually felt this way sending back a product like i usually i'm like oh
[02:13:57.560 --> 02:14:03.160]   good riddance like i just want to go back to the thing i'm used to i was so sad about the sm7b going
[02:14:03.160 --> 02:14:08.440]   back to shore that i literally same day that i shipped it back went out and bought one for myself
[02:14:08.440 --> 02:14:17.720]   so um but i i do it's a video where i walk through like air pods pro a 70-dollar microphone a 150
[02:14:17.720 --> 02:14:23.320]   dollar microphone a 170-dollar microphone i'm like here's how you can tell the difference in sound
[02:14:23.320 --> 02:14:26.280]   between all of them what they sound like yeah that's me and i'm in the same sweater i'm in the
[02:14:26.280 --> 02:14:31.800]   exact same sweater look at that we didn't know that we didn't have to know that by the way that is
[02:14:31.800 --> 02:14:38.840]   just today yes right but it's it's a nice video if you're looking if you're looking to like much
[02:14:38.840 --> 02:14:43.640]   like the computer boom of last year if you're realizing that you're at home setup is in need of
[02:14:43.640 --> 02:14:48.680]   an audio upgrade if you need a microphone upgrade um i had a lot of fun testing out microphones at
[02:14:48.680 --> 02:14:52.920]   different price points and it i hope it's helpful for you if that's something you're looking for
[02:14:52.920 --> 02:15:00.920]   uh we use that as it's so funny because that we use that what is it smb7 sm7 we use that in radio
[02:15:00.920 --> 02:15:05.800]   for years that's all i ever worked with it's a work force it's a work force well you just sold
[02:15:05.800 --> 02:15:10.200]   man just added to my amazon car you need it i don't know what what the hell are you wearing rich what
[02:15:10.200 --> 02:15:15.400]   is that is this is my sports caster it's what it looks like yeah i love it this is how i do my
[02:15:15.400 --> 02:15:21.160]   podcast it's so easy it's you know no one sees me and it's just so easy to like have anywhere i am
[02:15:21.160 --> 02:15:28.680]   um i love it anyway i'm not sealed from ashley's thunder no you should get one i i just so i cannot
[02:15:28.680 --> 02:15:33.240]   say enough about how much i love this yeah those are classics when i started using them in radio
[02:15:33.240 --> 02:15:38.840]   at first it hurt my voice i actually got a little horse because i was for the first time hearing
[02:15:38.840 --> 02:15:44.040]   stuff in my voice that i'd never heard before and i was kind of adjusting it to try and
[02:15:44.040 --> 02:15:49.720]   connect it to make it sound better uh so it's yeah it's that good it's really i have also found that
[02:15:49.720 --> 02:15:55.160]   i speak in lower tones with this microphone because i can hear yeah you don't need to project at all
[02:15:55.160 --> 02:16:01.080]   it's a very good like i know this is like a very sexist thing to say about myself but i like i
[02:16:01.080 --> 02:16:08.040]   have been told that i can be very shrill and so some some people on the internet have maybe say
[02:16:08.040 --> 02:16:11.960]   i should cruise them what the hell do they know i mean look i don't i don't really care it's an
[02:16:11.960 --> 02:16:17.800]   either here nor there but like in some situations they have not been wrong and so uh so yeah this has
[02:16:17.800 --> 02:16:22.280]   actually been a very nice upgrade so you should always talk like this i had with people actually
[02:16:22.280 --> 02:16:27.240]   you've made a living you've made a living on the internet trail for years and i made a living
[02:16:27.240 --> 02:16:32.840]   intro so i mean give me a breath so i think i think people don't mind the sound of the voice i hate
[02:16:32.840 --> 02:16:37.400]   fake voices i don't know we started watching the witcher and i don't know why Henry Cavill's dog
[02:16:37.400 --> 02:16:42.200]   he liked this all the time but i really hate it i just it's for the it's for the ladies
[02:16:42.200 --> 02:16:46.200]   it's not honestly honestly it's absolutely not for you it gets you going no it is not
[02:16:46.200 --> 02:16:49.880]   yeah christian everything about him she knows what's up everything about him gets
