[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   It's time for Twit. Great panel for you. We've got Glenn Fleischman back. He's so much fun.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Denise Howell from This Week in Law and a brand new A Newbie.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   But I think she's going to be great. Caitlyn McGarry, she's the news editor at Protocol.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   And she's going to talk about the drop in Bitcoin values. Just did a whole show on that one.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   Elon Musk, is he abandoning his Twitter deal? And what did Google announce at Google I/O?
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   Anything? It's all coming up next. On Twit.

[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   It's time for Twit, this week at Tech. The show where we talk about the latest Tech News
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   which means it's Elon Musk all the time.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   No, it's not. It's not.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Let's introduce our panel before we get too far down that road.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Glenn Fleischman is back. We had such fun with you, Glenn, on this week at Google.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   I said, "I've got to get you on Twig."
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   He is a longtime tech journalist.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Glenn.fun is his new website.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   We talked a lot about type and typography and you taught me the word "flong."
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   I brought some just in case we have a moment to talk about it.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Glenn goes, "Oh, that's a John Glenn." Nice!
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   That's a John Glenn. I've got a teaser if you have time later.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Oh good. Oh, we'll talk about it. That's great. It's great to have you back. Welcome, Glenn.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Thank you.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Also from this week in law, the Internet's lawyer, Denise Howell.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Always a pleasure. Good to see you, Denise.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   It's great to see you all.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   You have some new comfy furniture in there.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Oh, no. Same old comfy furniture that's always been in my office.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Oh, okay. This just looks even more comfy.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Yeah, it's nice.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   When we have to do family zooms with people, we can't even sit behind me.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Oh, that's it. This is your zoom studio. I get it.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   I get it. And somebody new on Twig.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   We're really excited to get the news editor from Protocol Caitlyn McGarry on.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Hi, Caitlyn.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Hi. Thanks for having me.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   You have a beautiful fireplace. Look at that. That is spiffy.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Nice to see you.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Can you put wooden burn things in there?
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   No, that would be bad.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   No.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   It is not functional.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Fireplaces are like an 18th century affectation now, right?
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   I got a fireplace. I just can't use it.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   It's beautiful, though.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Yeah, it's gorgeous. You got a mantle.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Mantle's good for putting all your awards on.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   It's probably a handy thing.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Anyway, welcome all three.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   I guess, okay, let's get out of the way.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   I don't know how about that.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   But I kind of have to report this on Friday.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Elon Musk at 544 AM.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   You don't want me to do this, Glenn?
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   No, no, I think it's important.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   It's just that every, it's funny.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   I don't want to interrupt you.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   It's just every single piece of media is so focused on him.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   He's gotten exactly what he wanted.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   I know. I know.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   I don't want to use his.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   I know.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   I don't want to give him anything.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   But it's important.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   It's important.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   It is important.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   So we're going to do this quick.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   544 AM, he says, forget it.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   I don't want to buy Twitter after all.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   And of course, Twitter stock goes down to 40 bucks.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   He's offering 5420.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   So that tells you the stock market thinks it's over.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   His bid.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   He then says, no, it's not over.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   He then violates his NDA with Twitter, at least according to him, because he tweeted that
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   their bot review process only uses 100 tests or whatever.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   I don't, I didn't even understand what he was talking about.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   But apparently the lawyers then called him and said, you're not allowed.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   You're not allowed to talk about it.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   He tweeted, Twitter legal just called the complaint.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   I violated their NDA by revealing the bot check sample sizes 100.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   This actually happened.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   I am so sick of this story.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   He is a troll.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   Is that what is your position, Glenn?
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   He just wants attention.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   I think he wants control.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   I think he's an abusive boyfriend who is taking over the Internet.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Kind of what he feels like, right?
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   He's like, he's material.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   If he doesn't get what he wants, he starts screaming and shouting.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   He will violate any law.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   It's not restraining orders in this case, but it's being abusive to Twitter key employees.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   He may be responsible for Twitter choosing indirectly because of how the deal is structured,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   indirectly forcing out two long time employees in advance of the deal closing, maybe in a few months.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   It's pretty clear he's actually violated.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   I'm not a lawyer and there is one on this program, so I will not comment in a legal sense.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   But at a cursory reading, it seems like he's violated the deal, so Twitter could get out
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   if it wanted to, but why would it want to get out when it's trading that money?
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   At this point, both of them have billion dollar exit fees, but I don't think that if you get
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   out of your car, it's not going to have to pay the billion dollars.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Two very important employees were fired by Twitter's current CEO, Para Gagrowal,
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   or Agrowal, Kavan Bakepore, who is general manager.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   He came to Twitter from Periscope, was as far as I know well liked at Twitter.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   He was on paternity leave, tweeted, I guess I'm out.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Para G says, we want to take another direction.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   Bruce Falk, the general manager for revenue, also fired.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   You have to wonder, is this Agrowal trying to keep his job with Elon coming in or Agrowal said?
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   He gets a bunch of money if he has to leave.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Agrowal, if I were him, I don't know.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   This is being very pecuniary or something, but if he's forced out or immediately fired by Musk,
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   he gets a huge pile of money for this deal.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   Why stay?
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   It's all very weird.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   It's all very weird.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   I think you hit on just Twitter really won out of this deal, even if it could get out because of a violation of their NDA,
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   which none of us know what the terms of that are, although this seems like something that would pretty clearly violate an NDA.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Is it violating the NDA to say that I just got called by the lawyers to say I violated the NDA?
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   That seems like a doubling violation.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Maybe they can't also each other.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Well, statistical Twitter was saying, and I didn't follow this to be honest because I'm not part of statistical Twitter,
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   that said that he absolutely misunderstood what Twitter is doing, and so he was saying it was 100 and it was nothing like that at all.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   So he tweeted that and there was just, statistical Twitter was just like, "Oh, this shows, you know, why?"
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   It gave them an opportunity to try to explain what the basis is and what sampling is done.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   And that actually might make the lawyers even more upset because Denise, if the information becomes public,
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   then you're not violating an NDA to talk about it.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   Is that sort of?
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   No, I don't know that that would necessarily follow.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   And the other thing, he might be violating his securities laws because he's...
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Well, we know that.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   If any of this is not manipulating the stock price so that Twitter's stock goes down, then...
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   Caitlyn, you said he doesn't care about SEC rules?
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   I mean, obviously not.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   I think the SEC is just a plaything for him at this point.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   It's like he's playing some weird game with them.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   And I think he... I don't know.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   I mean, I think his tweets on Friday were just him having fun.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Like, what does it mean to put a deal on hold?
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   You either do the deal or you don't do the deal.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Like, what does it mean?
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   It's actually not in a position to put it on hold.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   I don't think.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   He's agreed.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   They could force him to give up that money.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   They could do it.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   They could sort.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   They said he could complete the deal.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   So, which would be hilarious.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   You got to admit.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   That would be funny.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   And then he'd have to admit he didn't have the money.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   How to turn off the algorithm?
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   And then he says something which shows his ignorance of open source.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   He says, "I'm going to post the algorithm on GitHub."
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Like, somehow that's magical.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   Like, there is even like a section of code you could just post on GitHub.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   That would be the algorithm.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   For anybody who doesn't know what you're talking about, Leo, you need to explain.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   So, Elon has shown in the past his ignorance about what open source means.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   When Tesla came out, he said, "I'm going to open source how to make these cars."
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   Which wasn't what he meant.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   He meant, "I'll license it.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   You could pay me for it."
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   So, there's a significant difference between open sourcing and you could pay me and I'll tell you how we do it.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   Sure.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   So, he clearly doesn't understand open source.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   But he's saying...
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   What is he talking about the algorithm and posting it?
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   So, when he acquired Twitter, he said there's a few things we're going to do.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   It's very simple.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   It's really easy.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   Why haven't they figured this out in 15 years?
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   I don't know, says Elon.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   But, we're only everything...free speech only if it's illegal, will we ban it?
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   And we're going to get rid of spam.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   Okay, right there, that's contradictory because spam is not illegal.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   Okay.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   And then, we're going to open source the algorithm.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   Which I think is nonsense on the face of it because I don't think it's one like, "Okay, here's the 15 lines of code."
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   What algorithm are you talking about?
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Is he talking about the...I think he's talking about an algorithm which on Twitter isn't even like the Facebook algorithm.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   It's just that if you want, you can go to your top tweets first or you can go to your latest tweets.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   And it's an interesting thing.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   You can go to your latest tweets.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   And it's an easy setting.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   He even describes it.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   That's how I do it.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   Chronological.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   Is that the algorithm?
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   I guess that's the algorithm.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   And is it something that's 20 lines of code?
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   Maybe.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   Maybe it's not that simple.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   I suspect it's not.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   I don't think it's simple enough that you could post it on GitHub.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   And finally, there's the problem.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   GitHub, of course, is a place where you could publish open source code.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   Then there's finally there's a problem that the people who chiefly would benefit from this
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   and people who would like to game the system to get their tweets show up higher.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   And who's that?
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   Oh, spammers.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   So the whole thing, we've had this conversation a million times.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   I got dragged into it.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   He's just a troll.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   I guess the last question that will go on to more important matters.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   Is he going to get Twitter?
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   What do you think, Caitlin?
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   This is tough.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   I...
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   There's no right answer, by the way.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   I know.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   Well, I'm not a quiz show.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   I'm not sure, because there are so many twists and turns.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   One week, I'm like, "Oh, this deal is definitely going through.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   He's going to buy Twitter."
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   And then the next week, he says something.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   I don't think he actually wants to buy Twitter.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   Now the funding is coming from a million sources.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   It's not going to belong solely to him.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   It's not as fun as it seemed originally when he set out to buy it.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   It's getting really complicated.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   And now I think maybe he's looking for an exit strategy.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   So I don't know.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   Every week, my mind just changes.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   Caitlin is maybe being crushed by the margin or not the margin calls.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   But he's got...
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   He's leveraged Tesla.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   I mean, I don't follow Tesla very closely at all, honestly.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   But it seems like my reading of the financial side of that is he has
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   leveraged so much of his holdings in Tesla and options and so forth
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   that with the drop in Tesla's price since the deal was announced
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   and the general market downtrend, he could be...
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   heavily compressed there.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   Like I wondered when he made this call.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   It's like, does this wind up with him losing control of Tesla and losing
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   the Twitter bit at the same time and winding up less wealthy and no longer
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   in that catbird seat?
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   And I don't know.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   Maybe he can just walk away and pay a billion dollars.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   At the beginning of April, Tesla stock was $1,145.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   It is currently $769.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   And that's because it had a dead cat bounce.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   It was down to $7.28.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   That amount, almost half that amount.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   And yes, he borrowed on margin.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   He's the richest man in the world based on Tesla stock value.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   So he's already lost billions and billions of dollars in stock value.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   And he borrowed against the Tesla stock.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   There could be a margin call if the stock price goes down enough.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   That's probably what's one of the things we're propelling the stock price down.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   So this is not...
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   For those...
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   And every time we talk about Elon, I get emails saying, he's a genius.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   How could you...
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   Why don't you have somebody on that says he's a genius?
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   So anybody?
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   He's playing 5D chess or something like that.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   5D chess.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   That's brilliant.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   He's playing us all because we keep talking about him.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   I tweeted something about him and then I thought, "Oh, he got me.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   I tweeted about him again.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   I'm muted.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   What the heck?"
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   Do you think he's going to get it, Glenn?
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   No.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   I mean, I'm saying that definitively is if I know anything.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   But I think that the...
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   I don't think the market's going to respond.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   Again, I'm saying this.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   I try not to be a pundit.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   But based on what's happening in the market and worldwide, everything is going on.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   We have this whole situation.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   A lot of, I think, fairly smart economists are saying the market's not going to rebound quickly
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   because of all these fundamental factors.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   Tesla's down.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   Musk is already finding this a slog.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   He's already done things that have violated public provisions that were in the deal that
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   was filed that you could read and say, "Oh, he's did this and this and this beyond any
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   NDAs."
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   Does he really want to spend another five months going through this?
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   I suspect he is going to...
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   What a percent he already bought of Twitter is down.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   So he's taking a loss on that too.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   So I wonder if he just washes his hand if it walks away, pays a billion dollars and decides
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   it was a fun thing to yank everyone's chain for several months.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   You agree, Denise?
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   I don't know.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   I was just working through, again, that he owns a lot of Twitter stock at this point.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   And so if he's out...
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   Not in a quarter percent, I think at last.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   So if he doesn't buy it, you know, he's just cutting his losses, selling that stock.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   He's tanked the stock.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   I don't know.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   Yeah, he's probably under water.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   It's like we're living in a simulation.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   Which he fully believes.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   By the way.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   He's controlling the dials.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   That's the problem.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   Yeah, I think the deal's gone south.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   I don't know if...
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   I think he wanted Twitter.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   I think he underestimated the complexity of what he was embarking on.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   And I think his shareholders, his boards on the other companies and general sentiment in
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   the public are going to convince him this was a bad idea.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   And he's going to pay a billion and walk away.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   We'll find out.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   I didn't think he was going to buy it, by the way.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   I said this is all a joke.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   He's not going to buy it.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   So I consider my track record.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:32.760]   Meanwhile, State of Texas is not waiting till Elon gets Twitter to regulate with the new
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:37.760]   Texas social media content moderation law.
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:42.040]   We had Mike Masnick on Twig on Friday sent me an email or maybe he tweeted this after
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:45.760]   the show saying I had just read about the decision.
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:52.160]   There was an injunction that kept the law from being enforced that the Fifth District overturned
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.360]   and said, oh no, go ahead.
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.360]   And it had just happened.
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.880]   And Mike Masnick came on Twig when we were talking about it.
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:16:59.200]   He said, I didn't...
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:06.040]   I was not clear how awful, how messed up this law really is.
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:10.880]   He says, I don't think most people actually understand just how truly effed up and obviously
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:15.600]   unconstitutional the law is.
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:20.040]   I'm going to let our official internet lawyer weigh in on this.
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.520]   Although Mike, I think is also a law school graduate.
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.480]   I don't know if he ever practiced.
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:30.960]   The law declares social media platforms common carriers, which they're clearly not.
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.040]   Why is common carriers important?
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:35.520]   What does that even mean?
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:40.880]   It's something like the telephone company would be a common carrier.
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:44.840]   And it's regulated differently by the FCC.
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:50.840]   Well, do the FCC say that internet service providers are not common carriers?
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:52.840]   So net neutrality didn't apply?
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:56.000]   They've gone back and forth.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   Under different administrations.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.840]   Depending on what they wanted to do.
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:00.720]   Yes.
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:06.280]   Our current status is they are not common carriers as far as the FCC is concerned.
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.120]   The reason that's important is you don't tell the phone company, this is what the Fifth
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.120]   Circuit was saying.
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:15.840]   Well, the phone company is not allowed to listen in on your conversations and say, we're going
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.600]   to ban you because you're giving bad COVID information.
[00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:23.360]   And since you're a common carrier Twitter, you shouldn't be able to either.
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:24.360]   Right.
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:26.040]   And it's just nuts.
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.040]   That is nuts.
[00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:32.120]   But that's not what anybody has to decide at this point.
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:39.560]   What was in place was an injunction preventing this law from going into effect until a court
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:44.720]   actually had the opportunity to have briefing and argument and decide those questions.
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:48.800]   And it's the court that's going to make those decisions, the district court that's hearing
[00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:53.440]   this case in Texas, that issued that injunction.
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:58.600]   The attorney general in Texas appealed that injunction to the Fifth Circuit, which is a
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:06.400]   very conservative circuit, a appellate circuit of our federal appellate system.
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:10.280]   And that court undid the injunction.
[00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:17.400]   So the plaintiffs in the case who are challenging the law are actually now going to ask the Supreme
[00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:22.400]   Court to weigh in and say, hey, this injunction was in place and it should remain in place.
[00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:27.640]   This law shouldn't go into effect because there is a reparable harm that will happen
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:34.560]   to, I suppose they'll say a whole segment of the commercial landscape if this law does
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:36.760]   go into effect.
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:43.520]   So we'll have to see if the Supreme Court decides to weigh in and reinstate the injunction, that
[00:19:43.520 --> 00:19:45.240]   is a thing that could happen.
[00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:53.760]   It is an unusual thing for the Supreme Court to do to second guess the decisions of courts
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:59.080]   below it on the question of whether there's been a reparable harm or there's the threat
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:00.280]   of a reparable harm.
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:03.600]   So we'll just have to see that could happen.
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:10.640]   But in the meantime, the appellate court that oversees this trial court has decided, hey,
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:14.000]   let's just go ahead and let this thing be the law.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.960]   Let's see what happens.
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:16.960]   Yes.
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:21.040]   Well, it is being challenged on constitutional grounds.
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:28.320]   And what might wind up happening is all of the arguments for how unwieldy the law is
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:34.800]   and all of its negative impact may wind up playing out while the case is actually pending
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:38.240]   so that the plaintiffs can actually make some concrete arguments.
[00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:42.320]   Hey, we were going to say that this was likely to happen.
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:44.000]   Now you can see that it's happening.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:50.960]   So it might actually wind up helping the plaintiff's case to get the law declared unconstitutional.
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:58.120]   So there's a, and Mike Masnick refers to this, a good thread on Twitter, of course, by Pope
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:21:07.040]   Hat who despite his name is actually a litigator named Ken White, not the Pope.
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:10.640]   And he says, this is why this is an issue.
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:17.760]   The anti-censorship provision of the Texas law says that any site with more than 50 million
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:25.280]   monthly active users can't censor based on the viewpoint of a person or the person's content.
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:30.160]   So you cannot censor somebody on their viewpoint or how they express it.
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.160]   What you can censor?
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:34.160]   Well, you can censor content that's illegal.
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:37.880]   Okay, that's a fairly narrow range.
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:42.520]   Although this is, this sounds a little bit like what Elon Musk was proposing.
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:47.720]   In the site can censor other things, but it doesn't say exactly what those are, which
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:55.960]   means pretty much according to Ken that every single moderation decision will be up for
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:22:00.920]   a lawsuit that just opens it up.
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.240]   Yes.
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:06.960]   So you can imagine that if all that starts to play out while this case is pending and
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:14.480]   the lawyers are drafting arguments about its constitutionality and appropriateness and
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:19.680]   validity that they may wind up with a lot more evidence on their hands for the court
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:20.680]   to consider.
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:27.320]   And remember, this court actually granted an injunction that prevented this law from
[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:28.320]   taking effect.
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:29.960]   But then it raises a question.
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:34.720]   Well, even if this court rules in favor of overturning the law, the Fifth Circuit could
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:39.440]   then take it on appeal and overturn it down the road since they've already indicated
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:41.600]   they're not, they're kind of in favor of it.
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:46.320]   They've already indicated and they didn't publish an opinion, but there is a transcript
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:52.040]   of the argument that undid this injunction and they've indicated they really don't understand
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:59.040]   very much about the internet, how the internet works, what Twitter is, what's a common carrier,
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:02.760]   what's an internet service provider, what is a website.
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:10.280]   So yeah, I don't have a whole lot of faith in the Fifth Circuit even really understanding
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:14.920]   these issues well enough to reach a good decision here.
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:21.120]   Denise, I'm not even a simple country lawyer and I'm reading this, I've got no law background
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:25.680]   of trying to stay up on the issues and I read this and it just feels blatantly unconstitutional
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:29.480]   because it's the first time I read this from Friday, like so many different ways, like
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:33.480]   seems so prima fascia, I look at it, I'm like I have no specialized expertise, but just
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:38.320]   the basic phrases and the law that are used, the kind of imposition that puts on private
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:43.000]   companies, the way in which it imposes a government mandate, I mean it feels like they're trying
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.120]   to take aspects of the sue to prevent abortion law and apply it to content.
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:49.880]   This is the Texas shoe horned as well.
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.920]   This is the new Texas way of doing business isn't it.
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:58.960]   The Texas law lets any aggrieved users sue if they think the site sent you to improperly,
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:05.440]   this is according to Ken White, and get attorney fees and costs if they win, if the Texas law
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:09.920]   stands he says there's no more saying it's Twitter's First Amendment right to moderate.
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:15.520]   This is where it's confusing because on the one hand people say well it's my First Amendment
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:17.960]   right to say anything I want on Twitter.
[00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:19.320]   That is not the case.
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:24.240]   The First Amendment says government shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:25.240]   Congress.
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.120]   And Twitter's not the government.
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:28.120]   Twitter's not the government.
[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:34.360]   So in effect it would be saying you have a First Amendment right with Twitter that they
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:42.120]   can't moderate but no social site, no site, our chatroom, our forums would survive.
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:47.080]   They would all turn into 4chan or 8kun if you couldn't moderate.
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:50.360]   You need to be able to moderate if only to say you can't use the F word.
[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.480]   I mean you need to be able to do that.
[00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:56.600]   And you don't even need section 230 to allow us to do that.
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:03.160]   That's where private business is running our own private social networks.
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:07.520]   Maybe the point is that Twitter has now some, this is Elon's point, some higher standing
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:13.320]   as the public marketplace of ideas or something.
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:17.720]   You'd need something more than the state of Texas proclaiming that.
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:20.080]   You'd need something at the federal level.
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:22.040]   You'd need congressional legislation.
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:26.200]   And by the way I guess this is just a good time to encourage everyone.
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:31.240]   We have primaries coming up and there are congressional seats at stake.
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:37.560]   Please look at your potential representatives and try and research what they know about
[00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:41.080]   the internet, what they know about privacy laws.
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:42.880]   Because here's the big thing.
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:43.880]   Here's the big thing.
[00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:49.040]   I agree 100% and of course Roe v. Wade is also up and there's so many issues that we
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:51.560]   really, you know, it's, but I have to say.
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:55.080]   I also understand how hard it is for voters.
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:57.240]   We're in California, Denise.
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:04.960]   We got a four page ballot for controller and judges and sheriffs.
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:09.400]   A lot of people we've never heard of, the amount of research.
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:12.200]   I don't know how many candidates for governor are there in California.
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:13.720]   It looks like a dozen.
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.120]   It's, yeah, there's your ballot.
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:16.120]   My ballot.
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:17.120]   Yes.
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:18.120]   And so.
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:19.120]   I just started filling out.
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:24.960]   You are going to go by the yard signs or maybe, you know, you're really sophisticated and you're
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:29.520]   going to, well, you get a card from the Democratic or Republican Party telling you how to vote.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.960]   You've got a lot of research ahead.
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:32.960]   You do.
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:38.840]   So prioritize the research about your potential congressional representatives, I guess, is
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:39.840]   what I'm saying because.
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:43.760]   Yeah, but then we got governor, lieutenant governor, controller, secretary of state.
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:46.040]   We got assembly.
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:47.360]   We've got red legislature.
[00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:49.720]   We've got it's just goes on and on and on.
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:53.400]   And I could see how voters are just overwhelmed.
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.480]   Leo, you hate democracy.
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:57.280]   I'm confused here about the.
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:00.400]   I love the democracy.
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.680]   It takes so much effort.
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:04.120]   I realize my wife is an excellent researcher.
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:05.480]   I have to admit, I'm far worse.
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:06.680]   She reads like voter pamphlet.
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:07.760]   She looks stuff up.
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:09.520]   She makes determined decisions.
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:12.760]   And I am, I think, a quicker to, a quicker to the draw, but.
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:14.720]   Do you just ask your, so do you do what I do?
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.040]   You ask your wife who to vote for.
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:19.600]   I often ask my wife because she's in the research on certain school board position.
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.640]   She's better ballot measures.
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:22.640]   I'm better.
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:23.640]   We often have.
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:24.640]   What do you do, Caitlin?
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:29.240]   You're also in California faced with a four page, four pages of unknown names.
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.840]   What are you going to do?
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:32.440]   I'm, I'm the researcher.
[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:33.440]   Oh, good.
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:34.440]   Yeah.
[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:35.440]   Yeah.
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:36.440]   Because by trade you are, right?
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:37.440]   Yes, exactly.
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:44.320]   Um, but yeah, it's really important just to know what's happening in your state, in your
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:51.280]   city, neighborhood, if you really care that much, which you probably should.
[00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:52.360]   But it's not easy.
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:57.960]   They definitely don't make it easy to figure out, you know, like, yes, it's important
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:28:01.920]   that people in Congress understand the internet.
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:02.920]   Like that's key.
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:05.120]   Yeah, that would be a good thing.
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.120]   And judges.
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.120]   Yeah.
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.120]   Judges.
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:09.120]   Yeah.
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:13.240]   So yeah, I mean, that's like the bare minimum these days.
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:15.240]   And we don't see that.
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:20.040]   There's no, I wish there were some quiz that, you know, we gave all the candidates this
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:21.680]   quiz.
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.320]   What is IP?
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:26.320]   And then we could see their answers.
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:30.240]   Doesn't BuzzFeed have one where you can just go through, you fill it all your positions
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.480]   and it tells you which candidates on a grid support?
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:33.480]   That would be great.
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:34.480]   Right.
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:35.480]   I'm sure those do exist.
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.480]   I am kidding.
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:37.480]   I go to, I go to ballot.
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:38.480]   Pedia.
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:39.480]   Yeah.
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:42.680]   Which I think is a fairly good, it's nonpartisan, right?
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:44.160]   And I think it does have information there.
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:45.840]   There's a lot of information.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:52.520]   Then there are local newspaper has a debate and has a forum for candidates and stuff.
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:56.080]   It's, I mean, I'm, I'm going to guess it's probably several days.
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:00.640]   It's probably 30 hours of work for me to figure out who I'm going to vote for.
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:03.640]   That's, I don't blame people for not wanting to do that.
[00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:04.800]   You were a good citizen.
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:07.800]   It's really, I didn't say I was going to do it.
[00:29:07.800 --> 00:29:09.400]   Oh, I told you already.
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:10.960]   I'm asking my wife.
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:11.960]   That's 30.
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:12.960]   That's 30 hours of work.
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:14.960]   I will not be doing it.
[00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:15.960]   Yeah.
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:16.960]   Yeah.
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:20.560]   Well, but, but so I understand why we, you, you nailed it, Glenn.
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:24.120]   I am a fan of democracy and it is hard work.
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:26.160]   And I don't think the bulk of voters do it.
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:29.880]   I think they look at, that's why TV ads work.
[00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:32.760]   That's why opinion pages and editorials work.
[00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:34.920]   People want to be told how to vote.
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:35.920]   Yeah.
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:40.040]   Well, getting back, getting back to Texas for a minute.
[00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:41.040]   Yes.
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:46.680]   I understand how if we're all confused about who to even vote for on these issues, how
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:54.440]   a court like the Fifth Circuit might be confused or swayed or somewhat in the dark as to how
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:58.280]   they should be considering an issue like an injunction like this.
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:04.760]   So it should come as no surprise that another circuit court has already held that a similar
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:07.240]   injunction in Florida should stand.
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:08.240]   Right.
[00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:13.400]   Now we have a conflict and that is the kind of thing that can involve the Supreme Court
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:15.680]   even at this injunctive level.
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:16.680]   Yes.
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:18.840]   But now we don't trust the Supreme Court anymore.
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:20.880]   So it hasn't been screwed.
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:27.840]   I mean, Clarence, Clarence Thomas has definitely indicated that he's on, you know, he's, he
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:31.200]   believes in regulating tech companies as if they were common carriers.
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.200]   Yes.
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:35.160]   And he said a bunch of things about section 230.
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:40.080]   So yeah, I don't, I don't know that taking it to the Supreme Court is really going to
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.600]   result in anything different.
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:47.960]   But yeah, it, I think it is important now that there is not real, for anybody who's not
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:52.160]   real thrilled with the leaked decision that just came out, that was authored by Justice
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:56.400]   Alito and he is the justice in charge of overseeing the Fifth Circuit.
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:02.520]   So it would go to him to determine if this is going to stand or not.
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:07.600]   So if you can decide whether to involve the whole court or he can just unilaterally decide
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:09.080]   yes or no.
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:10.280]   What do they, what do they call that?
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:12.120]   The secret bench docket.
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:13.120]   What do they?
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:14.120]   Yeah.
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:16.760]   The midnight, the secret docket, I think it's called.
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:17.760]   The midnight docket.
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:18.760]   Yeah.
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:21.760]   Shadow, shadow, the shadow docket.
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:27.040]   I will say I, but a quite, Kavanaugh for anything you may think about Kavanaugh, the
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:33.360]   things he writes about commerce and free speech are more interesting than you would suspect.
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:37.720]   And I remember particularly because I try to hammer the drum about monopsony, which is
[00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:41.320]   the ability for a company to control what price it pays suppliers essentially, the ability
[00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:47.080]   to corner a market on purchasing things like Amazon is a monopsony in part and the new
[00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:50.120]   head of the, well, not new now, but the FTC head, I think we're going to talk about that
[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:51.120]   later.
[00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:54.960]   Lena Kahn, she wrote that great paper that was in part about monopsony and the inability
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:32:00.960]   of antitrust laws to affect situations in which the consumer price wasn't the issue.
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:04.960]   And Kavanaugh has written very interestingly about monopsony and other consumer protection
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:05.960]   issues.
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:06.960]   So I don't know.
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:07.960]   It's, it's what's a mixed bag.
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:10.800]   Like uncertain laws, you, you're like, well, there's a six, three majority now and others
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:17.520]   like, well, Roberts is going to shade and maybe Kavanaugh and, and maybe, um, uh, uh,
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:21.280]   non blanket on the fellow whose name who personally should have, of course, of course,
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:25.880]   such thank you, I didn't want to say the wrong name there, but they might, uh, in previous
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:29.280]   decisions, there's been six, three and five, four in which they've been involved.
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:34.400]   You're saying that the conservative, that the conservative block isn't necessarily predictable
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:36.200]   when it comes to first amendment.
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:39.600]   I think at a few things, there's been some surprising stuff for seven, two decisions,
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:43.160]   things like that where you'd be like, you think there would be a more, uh, based on
[00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:46.880]   other decisions on sort of, I mean, there's the social progressive side, the progressive
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:47.880]   and privacy side.
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:51.720]   And then there's issues that are more mundane that affect commerce where I think there's,
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:57.080]   uh, there is still a middle there, uh, led by Roberts who will find some majority.
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:04.320]   There's, uh, uh, the Ken White points out also in the, um, in this thread.
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:08.960]   There's, and I'm going to have to defer to you, uh, to understand this a little bit better
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:14.120]   than these, but there's language in the bill making it deliberately harder for sites to
[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:20.440]   defend claims and it made clear that people can keep suing in different Texas courts
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:26.440]   until a court with authority over all those courts says the law is invalid.
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:31.680]   Non-mutual issue preclusion and non-mutual claim preclusion are not defenses to an action
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:33.200]   brought into this section.
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:34.200]   Yeah.
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:40.520]   And because of all the constitutional challenges to this law in it, they've, they've rapidly
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:46.480]   added language saying, Hey, to the extent any of this law is held unconstitutional.
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:47.480]   It's severable.
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:50.200]   And the rest of the law goes into effect.
[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:51.200]   Wow.
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:55.040]   So any court that, that wants to do away with this law is going to have to do away with
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:56.040]   the whole thing.
[00:33:56.040 --> 00:34:01.080]   The Texas, the Texas legislature going to a written Texas legislature and the AG are
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:07.240]   very good now at coming up with ways to circumvent the court.
[00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:09.400]   Anybody who doesn't agree with them, basically.
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:10.400]   Uh, wow.
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:11.400]   Wow.
[00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:12.400]   Yeah.
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:14.560]   I, I, I do think there's some interesting.
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:17.360]   These are good country lawyers.
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:18.360]   Yeah.
[00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:20.520]   There's, yeah, there's some interesting discussions.
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:23.520]   There's going to be some interesting stuff for the court when it ultimately gets to a
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:26.760]   court to consider the constitutionality of this.
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:32.960]   You know, what exactly does it mean to restrict someone's viewpoint for, for one thing?
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:35.080]   That's a little vague.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:39.360]   And, um, well, also vague is 50 million, uh, monthly users.
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:45.040]   It's not, yeah, it's not clear who would, the law does not say who would do the counting.
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.040]   Right.
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:55.200]   So, uh, and, and it's, so it's, it's, I mean, it would perhaps almost certainly, uh, impact
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:59.400]   Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, Snapchat, Wikipedia and Pinterest.
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:04.240]   Boy, I hate for Wikipedia to be forced to couch out of this.
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:05.240]   Oh God.
[00:35:05.240 --> 00:35:08.120]   Possibly, but not definitely covered Twitter.
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:11.040]   Just in WordPress Reddit, the run in the border here.
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:13.960]   Yelp TripAdvisor, Discord.
[00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:16.920]   Oh boy.
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:20.360]   Discord could be liable to this.
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:24.000]   Um, so, so.
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.520]   Back to showing irreparable harm.
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:32.800]   I mean, if, if that, if that goes into effect in these slew lawsuits starts to fall upon
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:39.040]   the companies you just mentioned, Leo, obviously, that, and debilitating lawsuits, the other
[00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:43.080]   interesting part is there seems to have been some effort, and I don't, I don't know if
[00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:49.760]   this is what the lawmakers intended, uh, maybe, but there seems to have been some effort to
[00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:55.560]   discourage companies from just saying, well, out of Texas, you know, no more Texas.
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:58.320]   Um, and I don't know that that would actually be effective.
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.320]   I, I do think that.
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:01.440]   Well, I think the law prohibits that.
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:08.080]   Well, the law says you can't discriminate against people just cousin from Texas.
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:09.080]   Right.
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:14.800]   But is that, does that mean you can't block us?
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.960]   I'm not sure if that's how the law would be.
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:19.720]   We're getting a little in the weeds here, but I'm not sure if that's how the law would
[00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:20.720]   be interpreted.
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:21.720]   Okay.
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:23.240]   That's certainly what interpretation for sure.
[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:26.720]   That's what they're trying to say is, oh, and by the way, you can't look at my IP address
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:30.520]   and say, well, we're not going to let you post on the site because of the Texas law.
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:39.800]   Or, or maybe what it means is because you're from Texas and you have expressed a viewpoint
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:50.120]   that we do not want to maintain on the site, uh, we will, we will not carry your content.
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:51.120]   I don't, I don't.
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:53.120]   Could you make a Texas section?
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:56.280]   Like this, like the smoke.
[00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:57.280]   You're not.
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:58.280]   You have to check.
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:36:59.920]   You have to check.
[00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:00.920]   That's right.
[00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:06.080]   You're not from Texas if you, uh, well, it's by the way, it's not just Florida and Texas.
[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:13.560]   The EU now is proposing that all your private chats, this would be WhatsApp.
[00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:15.480]   This would be signal.
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:20.920]   This would be Facebook messenger scanned for child abuse.
[00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:25.280]   It would eliminate effectively the, any kind of encryption.
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:32.200]   The European commission a couple of days ago revealed long awaited proposals aimed at CSAM,
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:34.640]   child sexual abuse material.
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:39.200]   The proposed law creates a new EU center to deal with child abuse content, introduces,
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:45.360]   and this is the key obligations for tech companies to detect, report, block, and remove
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:47.440]   CSAM from their platforms.
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:49.360]   And you don't get to say, oh, it's encrypted.
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:50.440]   We can't see into it.
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:52.880]   You're responsible.
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:38:03.960]   Something grooming, which is a very nebulous term, uh, you know, that, that really poses
[00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:04.960]   some real problems.
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:06.880]   I mean, grooming is very subtle, right?
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:08.400]   How do you know it's grooming?
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:16.480]   Yeah, I've got two teenage children who have been relatively savvy online, uh, no major
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:19.280]   conflicts that they've gotten into.
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:23.200]   Um, and, uh, we've always had a policy, we signed a technology contract with them when
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:24.200]   they were much younger.
[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:25.200]   That's wise.
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:27.000]   And said, here's, here's what you can do and can't do.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.640]   And here's, you know, and then of course they violated many provisions of it.
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:30.640]   Did we sue them?
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:34.440]   No, not we think we've been suing over a lack of this.
[00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:35.440]   Thank you.
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:36.440]   Yes.
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:38.720]   We did not, but we, uh, we have always had great negotiating with them.
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:42.840]   So when we discover they've done something they shouldn't, they feel terrible, which
[00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:44.720]   is how, you know, that's good.
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:46.280]   They know they did something they shouldn't have.
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:48.920]   And we talked through like what the risk would have been and what could have happened.
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:52.440]   So, uh, but it was important to set the limits up front.
[00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:56.440]   And I don't think many parents do that unfortunately because the kids are savvier than the parents.
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:39:00.040]   No, if you're in your parents don't have to because that's right.
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:01.600]   The government will just do it for you.
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:02.600]   Government will do it for you.
[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:03.600]   It always works.
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:08.440]   If it's passed and this is always a tricky thing with the EU because they propose, they
[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:12.920]   pass, then the individual countries have to approve and talk about enforcement.
[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:17.240]   So it's always hard to know where in this, it's right now it's a proposed thing.
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:20.320]   But if it's passed, tech companies would have to conduct risk.
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:24.880]   It's basically what Apple said they were going to do that there was a whole furor in the
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.720]   Apple back down.
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:32.560]   Um, they, but install, they said tech companies must start installing and operating technologies
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:35.520]   to detect CSAM.
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:41.680]   Um, and I guess really end, end to end encryption would be dead in this case because they say
[00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:45.280]   specifically it has to be used even when end to end encryption is in place.
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:50.960]   Obviously that means there's no end to end encryption or you couldn't do it.
[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:54.040]   So this is, you know, this is not just Texas or Florida.
[00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:57.520]   This is, this is the world coming for you.
[00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:02.920]   Um, that companies are definitely nervous about what's happening in Europe right now
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:09.200]   because the EU is just like, like every couple of weeks they're coming out with legislation.
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:12.760]   You know, they're going to force all the messaging apps to work together.
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:17.080]   So I message will be forced to open up what's Apple before to open up.
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:23.000]   Like there's, they're just, they're on a tear right now and they are totally like their
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:29.800]   antitrust chief is just, yeah, she just wants to make sure that everything is fair for consumers
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:32.480]   and tech companies are very nervous about what's happening.
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:34.600]   Margarit Vistiger.
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:40.480]   The, um, I asked last week Alex Kentrawitz who's a big technology guy.
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:45.000]   Uh, if he thought on balance, the EU laws like GDPR were good or bad.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.120]   He said they're all, they've all been bad.
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:51.720]   They, they, they haven't affected affected the change we wanted.
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:56.480]   Um, see, cause I thought, well, at least there's some privacy protections, you know,
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:00.800]   that the EU is putting forward, but the cons, the unintended negative consequences have
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:02.360]   been horrific.
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:03.880]   And you know, you get these cookie banners.
[00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:04.880]   Great.
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:05.880]   Thank you very much.
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:06.880]   Right.
[00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:11.360]   Except all, except all cookies and just move on with your life.
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:12.360]   Yeah.
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:13.360]   All right.
[00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:14.360]   Well, all right.
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:20.640]   That was our, does anybody see, does anybody see the irony in, in Elon wanting to do away
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:26.800]   with moderation and the EU going full steam ahead with all forms of moderation it can
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:27.800]   muster?
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:28.800]   Yeah.
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:35.720]   I mean, if I, again, this is another argument that Elon should just drop it like a hot potato.
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:38.200]   Does he really want to get in this battle?
[00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:39.200]   Maybe he does.
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:42.560]   He seems like he kind of likes the fisticuffs.
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:44.920]   All right.
[00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:48.480]   One more Elon story, then we're going to take a break.
[00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:50.480]   It's like candy.
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:51.880]   It's like candy.
[00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:53.240]   I love it.
[00:41:53.240 --> 00:42:02.480]   Um, on Tuesday, Elon praised Chinese workers for burning the three AM oil.
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:08.920]   He said that there's just a lot of super talented, hardworking people in China who strongly
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:10.680]   believe in manufacturing.
[00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:13.480]   They won't just be burning them midnight oil.
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:15.720]   They'll be burning the three AM oil.
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:18.400]   They won't even leave the factory type of thing.
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:21.040]   Whereas in America, people are trying to avoid going to work at all.
[00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:24.160]   Is he having his cars made in a prison?
[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:29.400]   Um, it is effectively, it's the closed loop system.
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:34.800]   You know, that's how they're doing it with COVID where it's a sealed building and you
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:37.560]   sleep that you sleep in the factory.
[00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:39.560]   There are no labor rights, I think.
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:41.440]   And you know, and there's no unions.
[00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:42.440]   That's for sure.
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:43.440]   It's funny.
[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:44.440]   It's a communist state.
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:45.440]   You'd think there'd be unions.
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:48.120]   Uh, Elon loves it.
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:55.400]   Elon loves it because he can make people work 120 hour weeks.
[00:42:55.400 --> 00:43:01.520]   I think that was singularly tone deaf for him to say that, uh, given the life of the Chinese
[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:09.760]   worker in these factories is not as far from wonderful $1500 a month in his giga factory.
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:10.760]   Uh, 50.
[00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:12.880]   He's always so fast about everything though.
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:13.880]   He doesn't do any.
[00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:14.880]   This is my problem.
[00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:15.880]   Jeff Bezos.
[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:16.880]   I don't know if we have that.
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:18.280]   Oh, that's a good one too.
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:19.720]   Has started mouthing off.
[00:43:19.720 --> 00:43:21.200]   Look, I, you know, I think I've said this.
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:22.200]   I know Jeff Bezos.
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:24.160]   He hired me at Amazon in 96.
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:28.120]   I gave him a bunch of advice and no, I did not make a billion dollars from it unfortunately,
[00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:31.240]   uh, but I worked there six months and I had lunch with him all the time, talked him all
[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:32.240]   the time.
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:34.240]   Never knew he was going to become a super villain.
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:37.640]   Um, never thought he had these, this sort of disregard for other people.
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:40.800]   And now he's on Twitter making all these economic pronouncements and things like he
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:41.800]   knows something.
[00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:46.800]   And I'm like running one company, uh, in a voracious manner that disregards workers,
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:52.720]   health and rights that, that runs rough shot across local regulation that is in, you know,
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:57.280]   imported, you know, and regular violations of various laws that it's how to settle,
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:59.200]   settle civil suits, all these things.
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:03.680]   Maybe it's become a better company, uh, now that it used to be by force and offering
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:05.400]   better wages and so forth.
[00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:07.400]   But, uh, it's the same thing.
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:11.320]   Jeff, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, all these people, they want to be able to have dick tots.
[00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:15.560]   They want to be able to say things that are unquestioned that, uh, let them assert a
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:18.000]   version of reality that is poorly researched.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.200]   They don't want to do more things.
[00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:22.640]   Something happens when you become a billionaire, I think.
[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:27.640]   And 96 Bezos was rich, but he wasn't mega rich, right?
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:28.640]   Yeah.
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:32.040]   He drove a civic and he lived in a tiny apartment and, uh, you know, walked to work.
[00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:35.440]   And I thought he was a pretty nice guy at the time, but I thought Amazon, I thought it
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:36.440]   was actually going to collapse.
[00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:37.640]   There were so many problems with it.
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:38.640]   97.
[00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:39.640]   I was like, I'm out of here.
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:40.640]   I don't think to do it.
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:41.640]   Oh, what a fool.
[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:42.640]   I don't regret it.
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:43.640]   I don't regret it at all.
[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:47.800]   No, I've got no, no, but I think so when people say, oh, you really that, you know, dismissing
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:50.160]   Elon's accomplishments, I think it's not unusual.
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:51.200]   Same thing with Bezos.
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:55.000]   These guys absolutely great accomplishments early on.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:00.360]   Something happens when you become that rich and that powerful, you can be detached detached
[00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:04.640]   from the reality of normal folks and you suddenly living in this bubble where no one says no
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:12.920]   to you and you suddenly think, uh, every pronouncement flowing from your lips is manna from the heavens.
[00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:14.280]   Howard Schultz is a great example.
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:15.280]   He ran for president.
[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:16.360]   Why did he run for president?
[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:19.120]   Even he didn't know why he ran for the CEO.
[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:20.120]   Yeah.
[00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:21.120]   I mean, this is right.
[00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:25.200]   We have all of our local homegrown, you know, our CEOs here in Seattle and I mean, Bill Gates
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:27.520]   was smart enough not to run for president.
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:28.520]   And I think that was a good idea.
[00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:31.320]   And how is Schultz put himself out there and he had nothing to say.
[00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:36.240]   If Elon weren't born it was it was born in America, I think he'd be president, but he's
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:37.240]   born in South Africa.
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:38.600]   So he can't.
[00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:42.080]   But on the other hand, I'm not going to put it past him and trying to change the constitution.
[00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:49.560]   So Joe Biden knows who knows if in his game of fifth level three dimensional chess, he's
[00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:52.720]   trying to help the US economy or heard it.
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:58.320]   But by praising Chinese, the Chinese factory system and Chinese working conditions.
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:45:59.480]   Not what we want.
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:02.200]   Yeah, it certainly doesn't help the US at all.
[00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:03.840]   No, not that we want.
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:06.560]   So Biden tweets, you want to bring down inflation.
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:08.320]   And by the way, these are fighting words.
[00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:12.760]   Let's make sure the wealthiest corporations pay their fair share to which.
[00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:13.760]   Oh my God.
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:19.200]   What a what sacrilege here to which Jeff Bezos replies the new by the way, thank you Twitter
[00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:22.080]   for giving us a chance to hear from these people.
[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:24.160]   The new what would they do without Twitter?
[00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:30.760]   The newly created disinformation board at Twitter should review this tweet from Joe Biden
[00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:34.200]   or maybe they need to form a new non sequitur board instead.
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:36.640]   Raising corporate taxes is fine to discuss.
[00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:38.640]   Taming inflation is critical to discuss.
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:41.000]   Mushing them together is just misdirection.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:46.120]   Although I have to say thank you to Twitter because immediately in the replies, a number
[00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:51.280]   of distinguished economists said, no, that's exactly how it works.
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:54.920]   That's exactly how it works.
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:47:01.280]   You want to reduce inflation, tax, the corporations.
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:03.320]   Biden was not wrong.
[00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:04.320]   And so it's good.
[00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:08.000]   You know, that's one of the things that Twitter does give you is a conversation.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:16.080]   And I think at its best, that's what Twitter offers us is if we can get it to be, you know,
[00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:23.240]   reasonable, not crazy and not threatening violence.
[00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:24.240]   We're in a weird position.
[00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:25.240]   Yeah, in conversation.
[00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:26.840]   Because we have, oh, no, you go ahead.
[00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:34.400]   I was just going to say conversation at that, you know, that level of that degree of power
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:35.800]   is something pretty remarkable.
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:41.600]   I remember when Sun Microsystems CEO, was it Jonathan Schwartz was his?
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:42.600]   Yes.
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:43.600]   Had a blog.
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:45.160]   Do you remember he had a blog?
[00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:46.160]   We loved it.
[00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:47.160]   We loved Schwartz.
[00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:48.160]   And that was incredible.
[00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:50.680]   Of all the CEOs, he would actually say something.
[00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:51.680]   Right.
[00:47:51.680 --> 00:47:59.880]   And this is sort of pre Twitter, but it's the same sort of zeitgeist of, you know, you're
[00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:05.400]   actually getting these people's unfiltered thoughts and responses back to them from people
[00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:10.720]   who actually know what they're talking about and can maybe persuade them to think differently.
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:13.280]   It's pretty important.
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:14.280]   Yeah.
[00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:19.440]   I mean, to be fair, Bezos is no longer the CEO of anything.
[00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:20.640]   Well maybe he is a blue origin.
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:24.400]   I don't know, but he's no longer running Amazon.
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:28.920]   But still it's good that he can say what he thinks and the president could say what
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:32.840]   he thinks and then people with knowledge can weigh in.
[00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:35.080]   That was a good conversation.
[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:36.720]   Bezos is wrong.
[00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:39.720]   It was a good conversation.
[00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:40.720]   Yeah.
[00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:41.720]   All right.
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:42.720]   Let's take a break.
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:45.280]   That's our Elon Musk segment for the week.
[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:48.480]   I wish I could say forever.
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:51.920]   But Elon is, if not, you know what?
[00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:53.960]   This is what Trump was very good at, right?
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:49:00.480]   Was keeping the conversation circling in the, you know, where you controlling the overton
[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:04.320]   window, getting the conversation where you wanted to be.
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:06.280]   Elon's the master of that.
[00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:10.600]   And he's, I think he learned from Donald Trump to be honest with you.
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:12.240]   Maybe he didn't have to learn anything.
[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:14.960]   Maybe he knew all along.
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:15.960]   Great panel.
[00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:19.000]   Glad it's great to have you finally on the, on Twitter on Twitter.
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   It's not Twitter.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   God damn it.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.480]   It's Leo launching a bid for Twitter.
[00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:24.480]   Oh God.
[00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:25.480]   No, no.
[00:49:25.480 --> 00:49:26.480]   It's come out.
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:32.080]   I, I think I've had an article that's still online about me quitting Twitter because of
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:35.480]   the confusion between Twitter and Twitter.
[00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:38.400]   Back in 2007, it's still online.
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:42.280]   I quit for about six months and then I realized this is a fool's errand.
[00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:44.840]   So I rejoined it, but I was right, right?
[00:49:44.840 --> 00:49:46.400]   Denise, there was some confusion.
[00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:50.280]   People I still have to explain that we're not, we're not Twitter and that Twitter came
[00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:51.760]   after Twitter and all of that.
[00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:54.360]   But, you know, that's life.
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:57.600]   Denise Hals also here, the internet's lawyer, Denise Hals.info.
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:01.320]   It's great to have you all as always.
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:02.320]   Always good to be here.
[00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:05.600]   And a brand new, wonderful contributor to the show.
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:09.920]   Caitlin McCarry is news editor at Protocol Love.
[00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:10.920]   Love Protocol.
[00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:15.240]   You came from, you said you were a gizmodo and Macworld.
[00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:16.240]   Where else?
[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:17.880]   Tom's Guide.
[00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:19.520]   Oh, wow.
[00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:22.520]   And I actually started in local news.
[00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:25.040]   I was a reporter at the Las Vegas Review Journal.
[00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:26.040]   Oh, nice.
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:27.840]   A real reporter.
[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:28.840]   Wow.
[00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:32.200]   Protocol is a great site still free.
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:34.200]   Thank you protocol.com.
[00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:37.280]   I'm well worth subscribing to the newsletters.
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:39.440]   It's you've got great people working there.
[00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:43.720]   It's really fantastic, including our own Megan Moroni.
[00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:45.680]   It was one of your...
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:46.680]   The icon.
[00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:47.680]   Megan Moroni.
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:48.680]   The icon.
[00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:49.680]   The icon.
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:50.680]   And I do want to talk to you.
[00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:52.680]   You do a podcast called the source code podcast.
[00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:54.200]   And I do want to talk to you.
[00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:58.200]   We got a lot to talk about with Bitcoin and crypto and NFTs and more.
[00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:00.520]   So we'll get to that in just a little bit.
[00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:03.160]   Our show today brought to you by...
[00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:07.160]   The best thing I've bought in a long time.
[00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:13.400]   About six months ago, Kevin Rose had convinced me and then he was on Twitter and Amy Webb
[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:17.200]   was on and she bought it and then she said this is the best thing ever.
[00:51:17.200 --> 00:51:19.160]   Now I've got one about six months ago.
[00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:23.160]   I got my eight sleep pod pro cover.
[00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:24.240]   Put it over my existing mattress.
[00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:27.640]   Eight sleep also sells mattresses if you want to get a whole new mattress.
[00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:30.520]   But they do something remarkable.
[00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:35.080]   It's the most advanced solution on the market for something called thermoregulation.
[00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:39.600]   The pod pro cover can bring your mattress temperature down to 55 degrees or as hot as
[00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:42.280]   a hundred 10 degrees or anywhere in between.
[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:45.360]   And there's reason why you want it to do that.
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:48.000]   And by the way, it's got two sides.
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:51.640]   So each side of the bed can have its own sleep stages.
[00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:52.800]   It measures biometrics.
[00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:54.800]   It measures bedroom temperature.
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:59.800]   It reacts intelligently to all that input to create the optimal sleeping environment by
[00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:02.480]   manipulating the temperature.
[00:52:02.480 --> 00:52:04.840]   You start by putting in the temperatures you think you want.
[00:52:04.840 --> 00:52:07.800]   I like to get into a warm bed so I have it warmed up.
[00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:11.440]   But then as I sleep, as I go into deeper and deeper sleep, it cools down.
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:13.560]   That's actually what your body wants and expects.
[00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:17.040]   And you probably know that if you've ever woken up burning hot in the middle of the night,
[00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:20.440]   that's definitely not conducive to sleep.
[00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:25.240]   And then I have it set so around seven or eight AM when I'm about to get up.
[00:52:25.240 --> 00:52:26.240]   That's the alarm.
[00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:28.840]   My alarm is the bed starts to warm up.
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:30.080]   And I wake up very naturally.
[00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:32.480]   It's amazing.
[00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:38.240]   As a result, eight sleep users fall asleep up to 32% faster, reduce sleep interruptions
[00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:40.840]   by 40% and overall get a more restful sleep.
[00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:43.440]   I don't have to tell you how important sleep is.
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:47.360]   It's nature's gentle nurse, the best medicine.
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:53.440]   It can do so much for your health and just for your state of mind, lower your blood pressure
[00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:57.760]   to decrease the risk of heart disease, even reduce the risk of Alzheimer's.
[00:52:57.760 --> 00:53:03.440]   And yet 30% of Americans struggle with sleep, temperature, one of the main causes.
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:09.320]   I think we're all starting to learn now that sleeping cool is really important.
[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:10.600]   But I like to get in a warm bed.
[00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:11.600]   So I do that.
[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:12.600]   Lisa likes it really warm.
[00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:16.560]   My wife really turns hers up, doesn't affect my side.
[00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:22.880]   She gets her sleep information, her sleep metrics.
[00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:25.720]   The bed's very good at that, by the way, because you're sleeping right on it.
[00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:29.600]   So I have a number of ways to measure sleep effectiveness, but I think my eight sleep
[00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:31.280]   is really the best way to do it.
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:32.280]   What I get here, 80.
[00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:34.280]   Oh, I had a bad night.
[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:38.080]   My heart rate, my sleep fitness was only 78%.
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:41.840]   I have to say though, if I go back in time, it's gotten better and better.
[00:53:41.840 --> 00:53:44.640]   I've gotten up to 99% sleep from this.
[00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:46.240]   Here's the temperature dial.
[00:53:46.240 --> 00:53:50.040]   You could see that at 10 PM, I have plus three, then it goes down a little bit plus
[00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:52.040]   two, wakes me up at plus three.
[00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:57.080]   You control that and the sleep doctor will automatically, the autopilot will automatically
[00:53:57.080 --> 00:54:01.600]   modify that if it notices your restless and so forth.
[00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:03.000]   Here's an insight.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:07.560]   You're something, your resting heart rate stayed high for longer than usual.
[00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:09.080]   I must have been up to something.
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:13.680]   Your sleeping heart rate was a little high last night.
[00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:15.600]   Really great stuff.
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:20.640]   Sleep better, more comfortably, with eight sleep.
[00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:24.840]   It makes me a better person and I think it will make your nights better too.
[00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:27.080]   Go to eightsleep.com/twit.
[00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:29.040]   They've got great Memorial Day savings.

[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:38.200]   You know those hot summer nights.
[00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:42.120]   Imagine having an air conditioner in your bed.
[00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:46.560]   If you're listening after June 6th, still go to eightsleep.com/twit.

[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:14.000]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.240]   Google I/O, I'm not going to say anything.
[00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:19.720]   I'm going to let you guys tell me what you think of it.
[00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:21.440]   Google I/O was this week.
[00:55:21.440 --> 00:55:24.720]   Caitlin, were you excited, impressed?
[00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:27.560]   What did you think?
[00:55:27.560 --> 00:55:29.080]   I was intrigued.
[00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:36.120]   I wouldn't say I was impressed, but there were a lot of forward looking announcements.
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:41.480]   There's a lot of hardware coming down the pike, which I think is really interesting.
[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:48.040]   I'm really curious to see the Pixel watch because Google has just let Wear OS languish
[00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:54.760]   and has not been spurring its partners to really innovate either on the watch side
[00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:56.320]   or on the component side.
[00:55:56.320 --> 00:56:02.240]   So I'm really, really curious to see how the Pixel watch turns out.
[00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:06.840]   And I think trying Android tablets again is a really interesting move.
[00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:12.200]   That is so weird because they basically let tablets languish.
[00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:14.360]   And the real problem has always been with Android tablets.
[00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:20.280]   The developers aren't making appropriate software that sizes itself appropriately.
[00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:22.800]   So it sounded like Google, they don't have a tablet.
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:24.840]   It's maybe next year.
[00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:27.960]   But it sounded like they were trying to encourage developers, but could you please write some
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:30.120]   software for tablets?
[00:56:30.120 --> 00:56:42.440]   I mean, if the iPad has a problem still with adopting Mac apps for tablets, Android has
[00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:44.920]   just like it's a disaster.
[00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:46.400]   Yeah, it could be so good.
[00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:49.200]   I mean, Samsung made some pretty good tablets.
[00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:54.080]   Google themselves had a seven inch tablet that was beloved.
[00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:58.640]   But for some reason, they've just kind of abandoned the marketplace.
[00:56:58.640 --> 00:56:59.480]   Denise, I don't know.
[00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:01.920]   Do you follow these Google announcements?
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:02.920]   Do you care?
[00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:03.920]   You don't have to.
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:05.560]   No, I don't have to.
[00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:07.000]   I think it's interesting.
[00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:10.000]   I think it's good for Apple to have competition.
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   That's true.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:13.080]   Well, absolutely.
[00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:15.720]   And who better than Samsung right now is the only competition?
[00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:17.840]   But I'd like to see Google step up.
[00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:20.160]   The Pixel 6 is an ice phone.
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:21.160]   Yeah.
[00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:22.960]   I mean, doesn't this reflect?
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:23.960]   Oh, sorry.
[00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:24.960]   Go ahead.
[00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:26.600]   No, I was 10.
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:28.400]   Oh, it doesn't this reflect?
[00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:33.040]   It feels like, you know, one of my favorite things that fake Steve Jobs back in the day
[00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:35.920]   wrote was about the open handset alliance.
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:40.000]   And I quote this regularly because it was a great insight from a fake character.
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:43.360]   And it was winners don't join alliances.
[00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:45.280]   And that was sort of the story.
[00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:46.880]   Did the real Steve Jobs say that?
[00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:49.240]   Because that sounds like some Steve would have said.
[00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:51.080]   Only the fake Steve Jobs.
[00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:53.080]   It was a perfect-- yeah, it was a fake Steve Jobs.
[00:57:53.080 --> 00:57:56.000]   And I was like, that is-- it's, you know, Chef's Kiss quote.
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:00.320]   The open handset alliance was a way for Google to dominate a segment of the industry and
[00:58:00.320 --> 00:58:07.240]   to give handset makers and telephone carriers, wireless carriers, a way to have skin in
[00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:12.000]   the game and control the outcome in a way that Apple wasn't allowing, right?
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:13.640]   But in the end, what have we wound up with?
[00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:16.680]   Is you've got really Samsung-- I know there are other-- I mean, there's other companies
[00:58:16.680 --> 00:58:21.360]   in the business, but are any of them making a majority or they're making real profit doing
[00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:26.480]   anything from besides Samsung in the space or doing innovative things at this point?
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:27.840]   They were a few years ago.
[00:58:27.840 --> 00:58:31.640]   So does it wind up being Google and Samsung are really the Android makers?
[00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:34.520]   And Google has to essentially take over that.
[00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:40.200]   By announcing a 2023 tablet, isn't that kind of saying, well, we're getting into the hard--
[00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:44.040]   I mean, not getting into, I realize, but we're going to make this a priority in the way that
[00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:45.040]   Apple has.
[00:58:45.040 --> 00:58:49.400]   It just feels like they've kind of ignored a lot of stuff going by, hoping partnerships
[00:58:49.400 --> 00:58:51.640]   would make it happen when they weren't as interested.
[00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:57.300]   Well, I remember they didn't say anything during I/O about Chrome OS, which is arguably
[00:58:57.300 --> 00:59:03.120]   a very successful-- I mean, second only to Android in terms of success.
[00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:05.920]   They didn't even mention it at I/O, which was weird.
[00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:12.240]   So I looked up the fake Steve Jobs quote, which came from 2007 and is just as applicable
[00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:13.240]   today.
[00:59:13.240 --> 00:59:18.720]   He says, does it not occur to anyone that Google is desperately grasping at straws lately?
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:20.600]   This is 2007.
[00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:24.440]   Nothing they've ever done outside of search has ever worked.
[00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:25.960]   This is 2007.
[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:27.280]   It's still true.
[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:29.280]   15 years later.
[00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:33.240]   OK, here's something that caught my eye from Google I/O.
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:36.400]   Imagine you are on the Italian Riviera.
[00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:45.240]   You are sporting some very, very cool, lightly tinted sunglasses on the beach.
[00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:51.520]   And you are so looking forward to interacting with the Italian local populace.
[00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:53.720]   A la Stanley Tucci on his show.
[00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:54.720]   Yes, yes.
[00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:58.080]   You're going to do some cooking.
[00:59:58.080 --> 01:00:01.720]   You're going to do some dining, but you do not speak Italian.
[01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:04.480]   Didn't they have the glasses that are going to translate for you?
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:05.480]   But here's the problem.
[01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:09.560]   The Italians are going to look at me wearing these spectacles and say, get out of here,
[01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:10.560]   you ugly person.
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:11.560]   You must be a mad at him.
[01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:14.280]   They need a better form factor.
[01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:15.840]   It's early days yet.
[01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:17.680]   They're very nerdy.
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:19.000]   But this is cool.
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000]   But see, this is my problem.
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:23.000]   And it's just what you were saying, Kaitlin, forward looking.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.680]   They always do this at Google I/O.
[01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:26.720]   They talk about stuff.
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:31.240]   The whole big thing with the Google earbuds, and you'd put them in and somebody else put
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:35.360]   them in and you'd be talking each in a different language and you'd hear them and your language
[01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:36.840]   and they'd hear you and you.
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:37.840]   Remember that?
[01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:39.960]   That was five years ago.
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:41.720]   Where are those?
[01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:43.920]   They never came out.
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:47.040]   It's a measure of how Microsoft doesn't promote themselves very well anymore.
[01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:48.760]   I think Microsoft's doing some great work.
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:50.720]   It's been very solid for years.
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:52.280]   And they added a feature in Skype.
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:53.280]   I think it was years ago.
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:56.600]   It's stunningly perfect translation.
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:58.040]   But also transcription.
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:00.320]   So my wife has some vision impairment issues.
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:05.560]   I know a lot of people with low vision and hearing impairment and so forth.
[01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:10.520]   I did an interview once with somebody who had no hearing but was using an AI translator
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:12.840]   to transcribe as I spoke.
[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:14.640]   So these are incredible innovations.
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:18.080]   And so Skype has had this feature built in.
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:19.760]   And nobody knows it exists, I think.
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:20.760]   Yeah, I remember a Microsoft.
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:21.760]   It's very, very good.
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:24.680]   I announced it was a very cool demo.
[01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:25.680]   It works.
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:26.680]   It's here.
[01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:27.680]   And you can use it.
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:28.680]   And everyone's like, oh, all right.
[01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:29.680]   Whatever.
[01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:31.200]   It's one of the most advanced things I've ever been released in this area.
[01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:32.200]   I maybe.
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:34.000]   And that's available instantly.
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.840]   And I was like, oh, no, Google, that feature they had that they never released.
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:38.840]   That's the focus.
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:39.840]   So it's kind of funny.
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:43.360]   Google does have real time captioning, which I love in the Pixel 6.
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:46.280]   And I think they're rolling it out to Android 12 as well.
[01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:50.520]   And they said that they will have translation in that, which again could be very cool.
[01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:53.360]   That might be more closer than these glasses.
[01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:55.040]   Ultimately, these glasses are great.
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:58.960]   I mean, they showed a video of two women.
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:01.000]   The mother only spoke Mandarin.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.040]   The daughter only spoke English.
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:04.360]   They're wearing these glasses.
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:08.480]   As her mother speaks, she's seeing an English translation and the heads up display.
[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:13.080]   So she's looking right at her mother, but she's seeing the text in front of, you know, projected
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:17.160]   in front of her so she can and then she can talk back in English and her mother.
[01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:18.680]   Again, a wonderful demo.
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:21.480]   I thought a great demo.
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:27.480]   But a demo only, and I, you know, it will remain to be seen.
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:31.080]   And of course, they aren't going to be so ugly.
[01:02:31.080 --> 01:02:34.080]   Although, you know, they're not as bad as Google Glass, right?
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:37.040]   I mean, that's pretty cool.
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:43.080]   But they definitely need to follow Meta's lead and partner up with someone like Ray
[01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:44.280]   Banner better.
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:45.280]   Yeah.
[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:46.280]   Yeah.
[01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:48.440]   Well, but there's a problem because you got to get a computer in there.
[01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:51.200]   You know what they didn't show is the battery life is four and a half minutes.
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:55.520]   Probably, you know, I mean, it's got to fit in the temple.
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:59.320]   This is a hard thing to do with the current technology.
[01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:05.400]   So this is, you know, it's very Google where they show stuff, but it might as well be science
[01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:09.400]   fiction even so they did announce the watch.
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:10.400]   Caitlin's all excited.
[01:03:10.400 --> 01:03:13.440]   And I think it's a beautiful, I think it's a nice looking watch and I'd love to see them
[01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:15.120]   do something with Android Wear.
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:19.040]   And I, and as I agree with you, Denise, I think it'd be nice to see some competition
[01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:25.080]   for the Apple Watch, which I'm wearing, but they said, but it's not available this fall
[01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:26.840]   with it with the Pixel 7.
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:29.160]   It's like, okay.
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:35.840]   So oh, they announced the Pixel 6A available in two months, July 21st pre-order, July 28th
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:36.840]   delivery.
[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:40.000]   What's I'm wearing an Apple Watch too?
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.440]   What is the killer app for an Apple Watch?
[01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:45.840]   I think it's different depending on who you are.
[01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:46.840]   Yeah.
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:48.240]   For most people, it's health, right?
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:53.720]   And this is where Google, because they bought Fitbit, could make Android Wear as good as
[01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:55.640]   the Apple Watch in terms of that.
[01:03:55.640 --> 01:04:01.640]   I don't know if they will be because even the Fitbits, I think the heart rate monitor
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:04.440]   on Apple is better than anything, even the Fitbits, right?
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:05.440]   Am I wrong?
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:06.440]   I don't know.
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:07.440]   Does anybody wear a Fitbit?
[01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:09.240]   Yeah, I think it's a good business.
[01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:10.240]   I wear an old-school-style Fitbit.
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:11.240]   Yeah.
[01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:15.040]   Fitbits definitely gotten way better in recent years.
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:22.080]   And I think Fitbit software has always been really good, but Fitbit's hardware team, I
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:23.080]   don't know.
[01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:26.320]   There's some questionable decisions being made over there.
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:30.080]   So the Pixel Watch looks great, and that was like a big concern.
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:35.680]   So if they can figure out how to marry the Fitbit software and fix some of the problems
[01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:41.000]   with Wear OS, then it looks like a really, you know, it looks like it will be a potential
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.640]   Apple Watch travel.
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:48.160]   And I think the timing, I think they announced coming this fall because people are wondering
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:49.520]   what to buy.
[01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:54.400]   They know the Apple Watch comes out every September with the iPhone, so I think setting
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:57.800]   some expectations there is good.
[01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:00.800]   Or maybe they're trying to rush something to beat Samsung.
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:03.520]   Part of this is because it always leaks out, right?
[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:07.240]   As the Pixel Watch did, and the Pixel 7, they even showed pictures of that because it's
[01:05:07.240 --> 01:05:09.520]   going to leak out because they can't control it.
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:13.760]   I mean, they've been talking about, there have been Pixel Watch rumors for years and years
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:14.760]   and years.
[01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:15.760]   Like, yeah.
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:18.920]   I feel like at Google at this point is just saying, "Yeah, yeah, you're right.
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:19.920]   Here's what it looks like."
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:24.280]   But they didn't talk about features at all.
[01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:27.800]   So to answer your question, these, I think health is one thing, but it's got to be as
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:28.720]   good as the Apple Watch.
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:35.440]   The Apple Watch, I think Apple does a huge amount, and I'm, look, I'm not an Apple fanboy,
[01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:40.640]   but I think they do a huge amount of machine learning stuff with people doing a lot of
[01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:44.640]   things to figure out what are the rhythms of those exercises so they can accurately
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:45.720]   measure them.
[01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:48.280]   And I think that they really are the kings of this.
[01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:53.480]   So for that, for a lot of people, there's a great book that just came out, "Trip Meckles
[01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:54.480]   After Steve."
[01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:58.400]   In fact, I'm going to interview Tripp on Thursday.
[01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:00.520]   Really wonderful reading it right now.
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:05.960]   In the Apple Watch, when Johnny, I've designed the Apple Watch, he envisioned it as a fashion
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:06.960]   statement.
[01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:07.960]   Yeah.
[01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:13.400]   He, you know, that's why they did an 89,000 gold one because he, he thought not as, not
[01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:16.320]   as, you know, as technology, he wanted to compete with Rolex.
[01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:18.200]   He saw it as a fashion statement.
[01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:23.120]   And then later, as time went by and Johnny left and Tim Cook kind of gained a sentence.
[01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:25.800]   He became, it was clear that it was about fitness.
[01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:27.600]   But I still do things.
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:32.040]   But, in the sense of, you know, I have a lot of things to do.
[01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:34.040]   I have a lot of things to do.
[01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:36.040]   I have a lot of things to do.
[01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:37.040]   I have a lot of things to do.
[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:38.040]   I have a lot of things to do.
[01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:39.040]   I have a lot of things to do.
[01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:40.040]   I have a lot of things to do.
[01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:41.040]   I have a lot of things to do.
[01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:42.040]   I have a lot of things to do.
[01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:43.040]   I have a lot of things to do.
[01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:44.040]   I have a lot of things to do.
[01:06:44.040 --> 01:06:45.040]   I have a lot of things to do.
[01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:46.040]   I have a lot of things to do.
[01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:47.040]   I have a lot of things to do.
[01:06:47.040 --> 01:06:48.040]   I have a lot of things to do.
[01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:49.040]   I have a lot of things to do.
[01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:50.040]   I have a lot of things to do.
[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:51.040]   I have a lot of things to do.
[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:52.040]   I have a lot of things to do.
[01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:59.040]   I know that I worked out.
[01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:03.040]   I will go to work out with my trainer for an hour and I will curse myself.
[01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:04.720]   Damn it, I forgot my watch.
[01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:05.720]   That did not count.
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:06.720]   That did not count.
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:07.720]   I did not count.
[01:07:07.720 --> 01:07:08.720]   I did not count.
[01:07:08.720 --> 01:07:11.360]   There is something wrong with that.
[01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:20.160]   Really, the only thing, I mean, people in chat in response to my question said the clock.
[01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:21.160]   That is the killer.
[01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:28.520]   I was going to say that and then thought I was being too facetious.
[01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:31.280]   No, no, I think it is actually a valid time.
[01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:35.280]   Timex makes a much better watch for a tenth of price.
[01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:36.280]   True.
[01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:42.240]   But the thing that keeps me wearing this thing is I do not always have my phone with me.
[01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:47.040]   Yet, I always want to be reachable by my family and clients and it tells me.
[01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:49.160]   So for you, notifications are a big deal.
[01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:50.160]   Yes.
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:53.000]   It tells me when I am getting a phone call and lets me decide how to respond.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.320]   Do you answer on the watch ever?
[01:07:55.320 --> 01:07:56.320]   Sometimes, yeah.
[01:07:56.320 --> 01:08:01.720]   It is like when they first put phones on airplanes and you go, "You will not believe
[01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:04.720]   where I am right now."
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:09.640]   Jeff Bezos, by the way, Jeff Bezos, big user of Airphone, he would call into, we are having
[01:08:09.640 --> 01:08:10.880]   a hiring meeting.
[01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:13.920]   I do not think this is still covered by any non-disclosure payments.
[01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:18.920]   We are having a hiring meeting for a administrative assistant for a VP.
[01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:24.440]   He called in from the Airphone to contribute to somebody who was 7-loud.
[01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:30.280]   He used that and he went out loud conversations on airplanes about corporate matters all the
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:31.280]   time.
[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:32.280]   Oh my God.
[01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:33.280]   And he was on commercial?
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:34.280]   He was flying commercial?
[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:35.280]   Yeah, he is on commercial.
[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:36.280]   This is how long ago that was.
[01:08:36.280 --> 01:08:39.560]   Before the IPO, he would fly and talk, he would run up these huge Airphone bills.
[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:40.560]   Sorry.
[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:41.560]   There is a little insight.
[01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:42.560]   His air yacht.
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:46.280]   This is this genius.
[01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:47.800]   And they were so loud.
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:48.960]   So now you do it.
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:53.360]   You won't believe I am talking to you on my watch.
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:55.600]   Nobody is ever impressed by the way when I do that.
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:57.240]   Because actually it sounds just like a phone.
[01:08:57.240 --> 01:08:59.240]   It does not sound any worse.
[01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:00.240]   It is not.
[01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:02.520]   Apple used the watch as a way to iterate on this idea.
[01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:06.200]   There was nobody who they felt was big enough in the wear space.
[01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:09.080]   So they came out with a thing that was engineered around fashion.
[01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:11.680]   They did not know exactly what it would do, what the market was.
[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:12.680]   And they went through a few versions.
[01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:14.000]   They were like, "Oh, it is about fitness."
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.160]   And then they leaned into it.
[01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:16.160]   Exactly.
[01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:17.880]   But I have an underlying heart condition.
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:18.880]   It is fully treatable.
[01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:20.440]   I should live a long and healthy life.
[01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:21.440]   Oh, good.
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:23.040]   And I do not need it monitored constantly.
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:27.000]   But I have to tell you, the EKG feature in an Apple watch, I have not bought one yet.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.160]   I owned one briefly when the 1.0 came out.
[01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:31.560]   I tested it for a while and I sold it to somebody else.
[01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:32.640]   And I have it on one since.
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:35.800]   But you know, I need a little quantification.
[01:09:35.800 --> 01:09:37.520]   I work at a desk all day.
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:41.040]   I need a little quantification to force me to reconcile what I am doing.
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:42.240]   And then these extra features.
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:47.520]   I don't know if any of you know, but no people this has happened to.
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:51.400]   But I know at least I want to say it is three people now who an Apple watch has worn them
[01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:53.920]   about a cardiac event and it may have saved their life.
[01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:56.640]   And a couple of written articles about it.
[01:09:56.640 --> 01:10:01.160]   But that is an incredible benefit.
[01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:05.760]   So they have found use cases that are not fitness is general.
[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:09.760]   But I think there is a lot of people who are generally about health who are happy to get
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:12.720]   one for the fall sensor, the EKG feature.
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:15.960]   I got my mom an Apple watch just for the fall sensor.
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:19.680]   She is 89 and I want her to be able to call for help.
[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:20.680]   It was funny.
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:22.160]   It was kind of hysterical at Google I/O.
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:23.520]   Remember we have all seen the Apple ads.
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:27.240]   It was during the NFL playoffs and the Super Bowl of you know, I help.
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:30.200]   I have crashed and I don't know and I can't.
[01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:32.560]   And they are calling for help and the help comes from the Apple watch.
[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:34.040]   Google showed the same ad.
[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:36.200]   They did the same thing.
[01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:40.880]   It's like did you not see that Apple already kind of did that ad?
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:45.520]   I guess they want to show that they also you can call for help with your Google phone.
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:46.960]   Well, not yet.
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:49.920]   But soon you can call for help with your Google.
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:50.920]   Don't get hurt yet.
[01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:52.800]   Wait for a little bit.
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:57.640]   I feel like Google has lost its mojo to be honest with you.
[01:10:57.640 --> 01:11:00.680]   Just like fake Steve Jobs 15 years ago.
[01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:06.560]   I feel like they're desperately searching for a follow up and search and advertising is
[01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:08.080]   keeping them afloat.
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:12.760]   But they have yet to find anything that is you know, that they're good enough at to be
[01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:13.760]   honest with you.
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:18.440]   I mean, Android successful, but not because of Google because of Samsung and a hundred
[01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:19.680]   other manufacturers.
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:23.640]   Now Leo, they're exceptionally good at getting fined by the EU.
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:26.640]   And that.
[01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:27.640]   That's their secret power.
[01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:32.200]   They just have too much going the Google Fi was interesting idea that they kind of lost
[01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:37.800]   in steam on the I K. What was the thing we saw so many ads for the just go the Google
[01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:45.080]   phone was a good idea that they lost steam on that's every Google wave Google plus Google.
[01:11:45.080 --> 01:11:47.880]   Do you follow killed by Google on on Twitter?
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:48.880]   It's very active.
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:50.800]   Yeah, post all the time.
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:53.880]   The other thing I like to follow is Web three is going just great.
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:56.880]   We're going to talk about crypto Web three.
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:58.680]   Kaitlin's got a lot to say about that.
[01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:00.840]   She does a podcast about it.
[01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:02.360]   That's coming up in just a little bit.
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:04.600]   So stay tuned.
[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:05.800]   Great to have all three of you.
[01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:06.800]   This is fun.
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:10.640]   I told Kaitlin before the show, think of it as a cocktail party.
[01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:13.240]   And we're just all kind of talking about stuff we're interested in.
[01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:15.000]   The only thing missing is an adult beverage.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:20.520]   So please during this break, if you'd like to get a little a sniffer of brandy or something,
[01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:23.280]   go right ahead and be my I have my Twit coffee.
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:24.280]   Yeah, I saw that.
[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:25.280]   Me too.
[01:12:25.280 --> 01:12:26.280]   Yeah, me too.
[01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:28.720]   I have to drink coffee just to keep up with you guys.
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:30.960]   I keep the brain going.
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:35.280]   Let me talk a little bit about since we were talking about crypto and you've probably seen
[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:37.440]   what's happened to crypto over the last week.
[01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:40.760]   Our show today brought to you by Wealthfront.
[01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:45.960]   Every once in a while, I'll see my kids, for instance, my daughter was doing her taxes
[01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:48.880]   and she said, Dad, do I have to report crypto?
[01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:50.280]   I said, well, did you make any money?
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:51.920]   She said, Oh, no, I lost a lot of money.
[01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:53.960]   I said, no, you don't have to report that.
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:54.960]   It's OK.
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:13:01.480]   She said, she was big on Doge coin and perhaps you remember it.
[01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:06.320]   This is what I tell my kids and I tell you and I especially tell young people and I wish
[01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:08.640]   somebody told me this when I was in my twenties.
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:11.160]   Sure, it's fun to play the stock market.
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:12.840]   Timing is so hard.
[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:16.800]   You can't really know when a stock's going to take off or when it's going to go down.
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:21.880]   In fact, maybe you've learned that same thing with Bitcoin, same with any crypto.
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:24.440]   Look, stock trading, crypto, it's fun.
[01:13:24.440 --> 01:13:30.280]   It's a wild ride, but the thrill of risking it all is best enjoyed in moderation.
[01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:35.720]   Like playing roulette or eating tacos from the taco truck down the street.
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:41.000]   If you're playing the market, I hope for your sake, you're stashing some safer money
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.200]   in a place like Wealthfront.
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:46.120]   Day trading stocks is not the secret to investing success.
[01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:48.280]   Wealthfront has a ton of data show.
[01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:49.280]   This is important.
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:56.320]   The time in the market almost always beats timing the market.
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:14:02.240]   Wealthfront has globally diversified, very important words, globally diversified portfolios.
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:06.680]   They do a lot of things you would do if you wanted to pay attention all the time, like
[01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:13.880]   tax loss harvesting, taking advantage of losses to boost your returns with automatic tax breaks,
[01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:18.440]   rebalancing automatically so you don't get too heavy in any one sector.
[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:22.800]   Those are all done automatically, so you don't have to spend a lot of energy thinking about
[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:23.800]   it.
[01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:27.240]   Now, Wealthfront has gotten, it's nice because in the past, you put money in Wealthfront
[01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:29.880]   and you say, "I have a certain amount of risk tolerance.
[01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:30.880]   Here's my time frame.
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:35.640]   I'm saving for a college fund for my kids or to buy my first house or maybe for retirement."
[01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:38.400]   Then they would make the investments based on what you said.
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:40.240]   Now you can do a little more.
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:44.280]   They have a portfolio of funds handpicked by their financial experts.
[01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:50.920]   In categories, you might be interested in social responsibility, clean energy, even crypto,
[01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:51.920]   cannabis.
[01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:55.520]   If you have an interest in a certain sector, you can use Wealthfront to get involved in
[01:14:55.520 --> 01:15:01.280]   those sectors, again, using their tools to build your wealth over time with a globally
[01:15:01.280 --> 01:15:03.440]   diversified portfolio.
[01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:07.480]   When we first started talking about Wealthfront, it was early days.
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:08.960]   They've done, I'm so proud of them.
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:11.360]   They've done so well because they're doing the right thing.

[01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:57.920]   So that's why I always say, you know, I have a Bitcoin wallet with 7.85 Bitcoin in it,
[01:15:57.920 --> 01:16:02.720]   which has gone up and gone down, but I forgot the password.
[01:16:02.720 --> 01:16:03.720]   So I am a...
[01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:05.760]   Oh, no, regardless.
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:07.120]   I'm long-hold, right?
[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:08.120]   I am.
[01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:10.120]   I'm gonna...
[01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:11.120]   I'm gonna...
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:13.640]   You're long-hold until quantum... until quantum computing is the real thing.
[01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:14.880]   I think you're before I'm dead.
[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:18.640]   I'll have a, you know, a hundred cubic computer that can solve it.
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:21.520]   Meanwhile, I'm just gonna hold it, right?
[01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:25.200]   There have been moments when I've wondered, 'cause that's almost eight.
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:27.840]   That would be almost half a million dollars at its...
[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:28.840]   Oh.
[01:16:28.840 --> 01:16:29.840]   Umm.
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:31.280]   Cryptos crashed a little bit.
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:39.120]   Caitlin, you cover crypto and other similar things in your podcast.
[01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:40.880]   Now you're a young person.
[01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:46.320]   Do you look at crypto thinking, "Oh, that's the investment of the future?"
[01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:48.280]   No, absolutely not.
[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:49.280]   It's sad.
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:50.880]   Because you saw the ad, the...
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:57.440]   Was it FTX that had Larry David saying no to everything, and it's like, "Okay, boomer."
[01:16:57.440 --> 01:16:59.480]   You know, you just don't understand.
[01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:01.920]   And every time I say, "It's just a pyramid scheme.
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:04.200]   Don't get involved in NFTs or crypto."
[01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:08.400]   And people say, "Okay, boomer, I'm not taking advice from you."
[01:17:08.400 --> 01:17:15.720]   I mean, it is obviously a wildly speculative asset, and we've seen over the last few months,
[01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:25.080]   but, you know, as the war in Ukraine has been going on, inflation, gas prices, like, there
[01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:27.880]   are just a lot of economic factors happening right now.
[01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:33.880]   And everyone who seemed to have some foresight started getting out of crypto last...
[01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:36.760]   ...toward then of last year.
[01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:43.560]   And now it's hitting retail investors, just like regular people who bought into the hype,
[01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:45.000]   and they're left holding the bag.
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.000]   Like, if you...
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.000]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.000]   Weird.
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:55.680]   How people who had incentive to make a lot of money and got out.
[01:17:55.680 --> 01:18:01.480]   You mean, when Matt Damon told me Fortune favors the brave, he wasn't there.
[01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:06.800]   I need to check on Reese Witherspoon's crypto holding.
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:13.200]   By the way, none of those famous people who pushed crypto are talking right now.
[01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:15.560]   No, of course not.
[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:19.760]   And like, I mean, obviously taking financial advice from celebrities is a horrible idea,
[01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:25.960]   but people are easily influenced and crypto seemed like it was on an upward trajectory
[01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:32.000]   that wasn't going to end until it violently did.
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:37.000]   So yeah, it's been really actually heartbreaking to watch people on Reddit and Twitter talk
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:43.960]   about how they've put their life savings in various currencies and it's horrible.
[01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:50.840]   So on one day, last Thursday, $200 billion erased from the crypto market because people
[01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:51.840]   are getting out.
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:54.440]   Let me just see what Bitcoin is at right now.
[01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:57.680]   I would point out there is an interesting thing, which is that I wonder how much actual
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:18:58.680]   money people lost.
[01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:03.000]   I think there's a lot of stories of individuals investing at the wrong time, but because Bitcoin
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:08.240]   doesn't have market makers, I mean, so $200 billion shaved off is artificial.
[01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:12.520]   It could be that the actual cash loss that was put in was $5 billion.
[01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:17.520]   So there is a sense that with the huge run up and you've seen those numbers about the
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:21.800]   percentage of people who own any Bitcoin who actually own it's a very tiny percentage
[01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:25.920]   owned the majority of Bitcoin and Ethereum, I think, are more than the majority.
[01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:29.560]   And so those people, especially people who've held it for a long period of time, they had
[01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:33.160]   a lot of paper losses, which can feel very painful.
[01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:35.720]   So I'm not disagreeing to know a lot of people did buy in.
[01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:39.880]   My 401k had a very significant paper loss as well.
[01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:40.880]   I mean, all-
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:41.880]   Was it tied to Bitcoin?
[01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:42.880]   No, it was tied to Bitcoin.
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:47.320]   It was tied to the full faith and credit of the fine U.S. economy.
[01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:52.120]   But I've been watching the chart on my too, and it's very painful some days, very, very
[01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:53.120]   painful.
[01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:56.600]   But it's easy to forget the gains we made over the last few years, right?
[01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:59.840]   It's been a bull market for a decade or more.
[01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:06.000]   So we made a lot of gains then, and it's just a shame to see it going all go to hell.
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:09.120]   I just told my children they're going to have to support me when I'm old, and that's
[01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:10.120]   now the responsibility.
[01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:16.400]   So you said an interesting thing, and I'm really curious, why is Bitcoin going down at the
[01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:21.680]   same time as the U.S. stock market and other investments are taking?
[01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:23.840]   It's not tied to those.
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:28.120]   I mean, doesn't gold go up when stocks go down?
[01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:32.440]   Wouldn't crypto be a good investment now?
[01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:43.600]   Well, because no, crypto is just an inherently risky investment, much riskier than traditional
[01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:44.600]   stocks.
[01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:45.600]   Gold is made up too.
[01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:50.760]   I mean, the price of an ounce of gold has nothing to do with its actual intrinsic value.
[01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:51.760]   I mean, right.
[01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:57.960]   We all, like money means anything and it's like anything because we all agree to it, right?
[01:20:57.960 --> 01:20:58.960]   Right.
[01:20:58.960 --> 01:20:59.960]   It's all CI.
[01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:04.920]   Yes, if we all decide money is worth nothing, then yeah.
[01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:11.760]   So I really puzzled because I do think that when the stock market tanks, as it has, people
[01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:17.200]   go to other investments, non-traditional investments, like gold, and I would have thought that
[01:21:17.200 --> 01:21:20.280]   Bitcoin would have benefited from that.
[01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:23.440]   I'm just curious, Denise, any thoughts?
[01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:27.760]   I don't know if you're the crypto pro or crypto con actually.
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:34.080]   I tend to think about how and whether crypto should be regulated.
[01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:40.120]   And of course, there are always calls to regulate it because it's at this point not
[01:21:40.120 --> 01:21:42.560]   regulated.
[01:21:42.560 --> 01:21:47.360]   And the stock market is, and as you point out, people are perfectly capable of losing their
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:49.400]   shirt in the stock market.
[01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:58.120]   So apparently our Treasury Secretary is concerned about stablecoins, Janet Yellen.
[01:21:58.120 --> 01:22:01.440]   Well, that's another interesting story, isn't it?
[01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:02.440]   Yes.
[01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:10.000]   Those would be coins that are somehow supposedly tied to the actual value of the dollar.
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:17.800]   And yet Luna, which is in theory, is stablecoin, has dropped 99 percent in the...
[01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:18.800]   Yeah.
[01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:22.680]   ... currency tied to Terra, which is the stablecoin.
[01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:23.760]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:25.960]   But Terra went down too, right?
[01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:26.960]   Yeah.
[01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:27.960]   I did.
[01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:28.960]   I thought stablecoins...
[01:22:28.960 --> 01:22:29.960]   I did.
[01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:30.960]   I thought stablecoins could not even know this could not go that.
[01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:35.320]   These are algorithmic stablecoins, which I wrote a book about cryptocurrency last year.
[01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:36.320]   I did know that.
[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:37.320]   I didn't know that.
[01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:38.320]   Well, welcome.
[01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:39.320]   Expert?
[01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:40.320]   Well...
[01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:41.320]   Yes.
[01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:42.320]   Can Kaitlin know...
[01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:43.320]   Kaitlin, please explain.
[01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:44.320]   Yes.
[01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:45.320]   I don't know.
[01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:51.360]   It was not super familiar with the concept of an algorithmic stablecoin, which has never
[01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:53.000]   been stress tested before.
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:57.840]   And that's why the Terra-Luna situation has gone so wildly off the rails.
[01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:02.680]   But Glenn, yeah, if you can dive into the technical aspects of the algorithmic part
[01:23:02.680 --> 01:23:03.840]   of the stablecoin.
[01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:05.400]   Well, sure.
[01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:08.960]   And the reason didn't come up last year is I don't think people were as widely invested.
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:11.400]   I think more and more infrastructure got built in.
[01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:15.040]   This book, by the way, it started as a neutral like, "Well, I don't think you should invest
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:17.680]   in it, but here's how the technology works and what you should do."
[01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:20.320]   And it's turning slowly into a stone invested.
[01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:23.960]   It's going to be like a screed by the time I revise it lately.
[01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:28.480]   But a stablecoin is supposed to be backed just like a money market fund.
[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:30.320]   You don't want to break the buck.
[01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:35.760]   That's what happened during the Lehman Brothers meltdown is the buck was almost broken on
[01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:38.160]   funds that are supposed to maintain a dollar, right?
[01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:42.600]   And of real money, and that was going to cause a huge upset in the entire financial
[01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:47.400]   market and required massive worldwide intervention to prevent a complete financial meltdown in
[01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:48.400]   2008, right?
[01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:49.880]   It was 2008.
[01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:55.640]   So the stablecoin idea is very similar is Tether is the organization that has the highest
[01:23:55.640 --> 01:23:56.800]   valued one.
[01:23:56.800 --> 01:24:02.200]   And they said at one point they maintained a dollar in reserves for every dollar they
[01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:03.280]   were issuing.
[01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:08.060]   And that has turned out to be entirely not true through their own reporting and work
[01:24:08.060 --> 01:24:10.040]   by a lot of other people who are trying to figure out.
[01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:11.800]   They own a lot of commercial paper.
[01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:12.800]   They own Bitcoin.
[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:14.720]   They own a lot of stuff that's not dollar.
[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:19.600]   So that's allegedly the best stablecoin and has tens of billions of dollars in it.
[01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:25.800]   The Terra Luna thing is algorithmic stablecoin in which the two, the, boy, this is the complicated
[01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:26.800]   thing.
[01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:29.440]   It's kind of like the two are interlinked so that if one waxes, the other should wane
[01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:31.800]   because there's a fixed exchange rate between the two.
[01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:34.240]   The Terra is a UST.
[01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:36.000]   It's been set up algorithmically.
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:44.720]   So it can be redeemed or minted for exactly one dollar worth of Luna at any time.
[01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:52.560]   That's the problem though because the value of one dollar of Luna is drop 99.7%.
[01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:53.560]   That's exactly.
[01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:55.880]   But neither Luna or Tether anything.
[01:24:55.880 --> 01:24:57.720]   It's like, it's exactly what it's like.
[01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:01.080]   For what you're saying then, this isn't a regulatory problem.
[01:25:01.080 --> 01:25:03.080]   This is a fraud and false advertising problem.
[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:04.080]   Sure sounds like it.
[01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:09.920]   Well, except that people, the Fed and other government banks have all said, we're going
[01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:16.320]   to have to do crypto sometime and it's going to be tied to some sort of stablecoin.
[01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:21.560]   And this is why Janet Yellen has terrified that Terra is falling.
[01:25:21.560 --> 01:25:23.000]   It shouldn't.
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.400]   It ties back to liquidity though and reserves.
[01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:27.720]   And so, you know, what upholds Bitcoin?
[01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:32.680]   Why is Bitcoin worth $65,000 each at one point and 30,000 at another?
[01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:34.280]   The liquidity of the exchanges.
[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:38.640]   So you have a small number of organizations that do not have super deep pockets.
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:43.080]   They're not central banks where a bunch of people rushing and say, I want to sell Bitcoin
[01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:46.000]   and they say, we will, you know, they're making the market.
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:49.000]   So they're going to be marking it up and up and up or, you know, lower and lower and lower
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:52.480]   and lower because they don't want to be held with Bitcoin.
[01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:54.520]   They can't resell to other suckers.
[01:25:54.520 --> 01:26:00.120]   So without a central bank, you have no way to prevent this kind of race to the bottom because
[01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:05.680]   the exchanges only possess a fraction of the reserves necessary to maintain the entire
[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:06.680]   currency.
[01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:11.080]   A stablecoin like Tether is supposed, or USD, let's say Tether's USD dollar denominator
[01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:14.800]   one, is supposed to overcome that by having actual reserves.
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:16.720]   So you can't break their buck.
[01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:17.960]   But in effect, they don't.
[01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:18.960]   They've been sued.
[01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:22.280]   I think the New York State Attorney General's office has a settlement with them.
[01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:24.680]   They're under investigation by all these organizations.
[01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:28.000]   I don't think you can redeem Tether in a lot of countries even.
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:29.000]   It's a mess.
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:35.960]   So yeah, remember in the Great Depression, the run on the banks, banks have never kept
[01:26:35.960 --> 01:26:39.520]   all of the money that in theory they hold in the bank.
[01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:42.640]   You can't go to the bank and say, give me my money.
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:49.640]   But there are regulations about the percentage of money they're supposed to hold, right?
[01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:51.640]   Wow, thank you, Leon.
[01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:54.000]   I'm trying my best to steward.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:27:00.120]   Oh, John, George, they're coming for our money.
[01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:01.120]   Somebody's not here.
[01:27:01.120 --> 01:27:03.120]   It's in Mr. Farani's house.
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:04.120]   Yes.
[01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:06.880]   And you and your money, you built the base bar.
[01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:12.320]   So yeah, so yeah, I don't know where we got a little sidetrack.
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:16.080]   But you're saying that the ostensibly these stablecoins claimed that they were fully
[01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:17.080]   backed.
[01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:19.520]   They were 100% backed by actual.
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:21.320]   Tether was what was backed.
[01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:25.360]   They alleged they were backed by actual cash reserves, like real cash money.
[01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:27.880]   A percentage they're over or the entire amount.
[01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:28.880]   Or 100%.
[01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:33.400]   100% was at any point you could redeem a dollar of Tether for a dollar in real fiat
[01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:35.160]   currency and they were maintaining reserves.
[01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:39.480]   And at one point their site said, we do this and then the site stopped saying that and
[01:27:39.480 --> 01:27:42.520]   then there's been lawsuits and investigation since.
[01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:47.160]   The Algorithic stablecoin says we have two boxes with nothing in them, but we have slips
[01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:48.160]   of paper.
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:50.920]   And if this one starts to get low, we'll give you a certain number of slips of paper for
[01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:51.920]   the other.
[01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:52.920]   And then that box will fill up.
[01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:54.960]   There's no value to any of these slips of paper.
[01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:57.320]   They're just two empty boxes.
[01:27:57.320 --> 01:27:58.320]   It's weird.
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:01.440]   It's a double faith hypnosis thing.
[01:28:01.440 --> 01:28:02.960]   If you believe, you have to believe in both.
[01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:06.280]   If you stop believing in one, I guess you're supposed to believe more in the other and
[01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:12.840]   people lost so much faith that even in this case, the organization that sort of keeps
[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:18.600]   Tara running, they have some Bitcoin reserves in order to help stabilize the price.
[01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:23.160]   And I think that's one of the stories is that where did the Bitcoin go that they claimed
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:28.480]   they had that they could push into this to push the price back up and stabilize the whole
[01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:30.040]   Terra Linux change.
[01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:31.040]   Yeah.
[01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:35.200]   Somebody in our chat room, Denmos, is saying UST was attacked.
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:38.600]   It was intentionally destabilized.
[01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:40.400]   People claim that.
[01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:41.400]   Interesting.
[01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:43.080]   It's going to be it's going to be tricky.
[01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:47.800]   A lot of people are people will cite things like BlackRock and other groups.
[01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:48.800]   That's right.
[01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:49.800]   That's a certain element of conspiracy.
[01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:50.800]   Alligations.
[01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:51.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:52.800]   But someone could have attacked it.
[01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:55.000]   But the question is, this is always the issue.
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:59.520]   If someone wants to attack a cryptocurrency, I mean, people have talked about the 51% attack
[01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:03.960]   you could do against Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies where you control enough mining power, you could
[01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:08.440]   roll back transactions and double spend and do all these terrible things.
[01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:10.800]   But the issue is people have so much money invested.
[01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:16.360]   So someone would have to have no stake in Terra Luna and expend some amount of money or
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:20.640]   other cryptocurrency to destabilize it in the hopes of getting some gain unless they're
[01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:23.480]   simply a troll, in which case they lose all this money.
[01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:27.240]   So there's something weird there because why would you burn your own money?
[01:29:27.240 --> 01:29:28.600]   And I don't think that's been determined.
[01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:31.400]   They're putting a squeeze on something else that they had a hedge against.
[01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:32.400]   I don't know.
[01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:34.320]   I mean, that's the part that I don't think has been answered.
[01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:35.320]   So I'm still.
[01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:36.320]   We're back to Elon again, aren't we?
[01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:37.320]   Oh, no.
[01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:41.040]   I don't think even he would do that.
[01:29:41.040 --> 01:29:46.240]   So there are some, by the way, Glenn's book, Take Control of Cryptocurrency is available
[01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:50.800]   and you update that because it's a Take Control book.
[01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:51.800]   Yeah, it's updated.
[01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:55.760]   I think it's a few months out of date, which means that everything has changed.
[01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:58.480]   I needed other updates from January is last time.
[01:29:58.480 --> 01:30:00.880]   But I have argued with the argue of talk to the editor.
[01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:04.040]   I should say, should we call it Take Control of not investing in cryptocurrency?
[01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:06.600]   Let's be really into it.
[01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:07.600]   I don't want to give it.
[01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:12.000]   Well, there are those who say that, you know, cryptocurrency requires the greater fool,
[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:13.000]   right?
[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:16.480]   The value of it depends on somebody coming along saying, well, I'll give you, I'll give
[01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:19.480]   you $60,000 for that Bitcoin.
[01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:21.320]   Have we run out of greater fools?
[01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:22.440]   Is that what happened?
[01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:25.480]   Did the pyramid collapse?
[01:30:25.480 --> 01:30:32.400]   Or as some say, it's because of interest rates going up, that it's better to put your
[01:30:32.400 --> 01:30:33.600]   money somewhere else.
[01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:37.320]   I don't, you know, I guess these are questions that just can't be answered.
[01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:39.440]   We just don't know.
[01:30:39.440 --> 01:30:42.960]   What do you say on your podcast, Caitlin, when this must come up, right?
[01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:50.240]   Well, our most recent episode was about the crypto crash and our lovely colleague, Owen
[01:30:50.240 --> 01:30:56.480]   Thomas, who is the FinTech editor protocol, came to explain everything to us.
[01:30:56.480 --> 01:31:02.360]   I got to get Alex Wilhelm, Owen Thomas, and maybe Glenn, I don't know.
[01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:05.120]   We're going to get some people come in and explain all of this.
[01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:06.120]   The thing is they can't either.
[01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:07.760]   I asked them and they don't.
[01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:09.600]   No one can explain this.
[01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:10.600]   Right.
[01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:14.480]   It just, yeah, it seems like everything feels really destabilized right now.
[01:31:14.480 --> 01:31:16.200]   Yeah, that might be the real story.
[01:31:16.200 --> 01:31:18.120]   Crypto is the one thing.
[01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:19.120]   Yeah.
[01:31:19.120 --> 01:31:21.240]   Crypto's big crash.
[01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:23.880]   It's the protocol source code podcast.
[01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:29.320]   Oh, I have one quick theory, which is just that we don't understand how leverage people
[01:31:29.320 --> 01:31:30.320]   are who invested.
[01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:35.440]   And because the liquidity is so low at these exchanges, it is possible that a relatively
[01:31:35.440 --> 01:31:40.440]   small number of people, including small investors, found that with the drop in the market, the
[01:31:40.440 --> 01:31:44.040]   rise in interest rates, they're concerned about paying bills, they suddenly realized
[01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:48.720]   that they needed to liquidate their Bitcoin or whatever holdings they had, and they liquidated
[01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:53.640]   and it could require a small number of people moving out because of liquidity that it caused
[01:31:53.640 --> 01:31:56.880]   the price to crash so rapidly that larger players get involved.
[01:31:56.880 --> 01:32:01.600]   And you have algorithmic movements by, there's all these institutional investors now involved
[01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:06.160]   in cryptocurrency who are doing second by second millisecond arbitrage and all the other
[01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:07.160]   nonsense.
[01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:10.840]   So there could have been a essentially an almost an accidental crash as people pulled
[01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:12.440]   money out, which fed on itself.
[01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:13.840]   Almost a flash crash.
[01:32:13.840 --> 01:32:14.840]   Yeah.
[01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:17.840]   And then those, because those people actually need the money, they have to pay their rent
[01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:19.880]   or bills or mortgage or food.
[01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:25.280]   And so they took it out and unless you have big institutional providers, central banks
[01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:31.040]   and so forth, supporting financial instruments at that time, it can collapse.
[01:32:31.040 --> 01:32:34.040]   And you know, yeah, that's very, that's very interesting.
[01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:35.040]   There's also.
[01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:36.840]   And I think you nailed it.
[01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:37.840]   That's it.
[01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:38.840]   Yeah.
[01:32:38.840 --> 01:32:39.840]   I think we solved it.
[01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:40.840]   So liquidity.
[01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:41.840]   All right, we're done.
[01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:45.720]   But I also think that people are starting to realize there's shenanigans going on.
[01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:48.720]   For instance, we're starting to learn a lot of NFT situations.
[01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:53.560]   There's a lot of trading back and forth to get to boost the price up between people,
[01:32:53.560 --> 01:32:56.520]   you know, selling it to themselves and buying it back and selling it to themselves buying
[01:32:56.520 --> 01:33:00.560]   it back to boost up the price, hoping then for a greater fool to come along and say,
[01:33:00.560 --> 01:33:01.800]   oh, I got to get that.
[01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:04.240]   Look at the prices going through the roof.
[01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:07.600]   And those shenanigans, I think, are scaring people.
[01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:15.080]   There's also the story of corn, but Coinbase, which, oh my, now I want to say this, I don't
[01:33:15.080 --> 01:33:16.760]   think Coinbase is going bankrupt.
[01:33:16.760 --> 01:33:17.880]   I don't think that's the issue.
[01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:21.280]   In fact, Brian Armstrong is the CEO.
[01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:28.640]   So there's no risk of bankruptcy, but they were required in their most recent SEC filing
[01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:35.160]   to say, should we go bankrupt?
[01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:43.840]   You as somebody holding cryptocurrency in a custodial wallet at Coinbase would not be
[01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:46.720]   like, if your bank went up belly up, you'd get insurance.
[01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:47.760]   It wouldn't be like that.
[01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:51.280]   If we went belly up, you'd be an unsecured creditor.
[01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:56.440]   In other words, get in line to get your money.
[01:33:56.440 --> 01:34:01.880]   And now Armstrong said, look, this is just legal ease.
[01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:04.000]   We had to say it.
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:05.520]   We're not going bankrupt.
[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:12.280]   But it probably gives people a little cause to pause to think and say, oh, wait a minute,
[01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:13.680]   it's not insured.
[01:34:13.680 --> 01:34:15.640]   It's not a bank.
[01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:22.800]   It's, in fact, I think probably a custodial wallet is a bad idea in general.
[01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:24.040]   You should do like me.
[01:34:24.040 --> 01:34:26.880]   You should have a wallet that you control and lose the password.
[01:34:26.880 --> 01:34:28.680]   I'm telling you, it's less safe.
[01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:30.800]   It's the highest security you can have.
[01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:32.440]   You've talked about the story before.
[01:34:32.440 --> 01:34:37.200]   The guy in England who has the drive that he's put the dump and he's stuck up on it.
[01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:38.800]   I mean, I feel terrible for him.
[01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:41.960]   I met a guy once I was researching a story for the economist back, I don't know, like
[01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:42.960]   eight years ago.
[01:34:42.960 --> 01:34:46.720]   And there was a guy in Seattle I met up with and it turned out, I found out later, he was
[01:34:46.720 --> 01:34:51.040]   personally generating in his apartment a single digit number of Bitcoins, like a high
[01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:55.320]   single digit number at that point because he had happened to get some of the more faster
[01:34:55.320 --> 01:34:57.800]   chips during a brief window.
[01:34:57.800 --> 01:35:00.520]   And he said, oh yeah, I've got a, you know, a dead drive over there.
[01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:01.640]   I've done everything to recover it.
[01:35:01.640 --> 01:35:02.840]   It's my off cold storage.
[01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:07.080]   It has, I think it was like $250,000 and Bitcoin on it, which would be worth, I don't
[01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:09.840]   know, like $50 million, $100 million today.
[01:35:09.840 --> 01:35:11.080]   And it was just dead.
[01:35:11.080 --> 01:35:12.080]   It was dead.
[01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:16.320]   He had the keys and I'm thinking, what percentage, how many, you know, ostensible fake tens of
[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:21.520]   billions of dollars are just permanently in a dump or in Leo's wall and Leo's hard drive.
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:22.520]   Sorry.
[01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:30.320]   Yeah, no, it's Denise's brother James Howell, who, who had a 20-gwig hard drive with thousands
[01:35:30.320 --> 01:35:33.200]   of Bitcoin on it accidentally in the land filled.
[01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:35.840]   It's worth, I think billions, half a billion.
[01:35:35.840 --> 01:35:37.240]   And not your brother in law.
[01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:38.240]   Is it?
[01:35:38.240 --> 01:35:39.240]   No, no, it's just kidding.
[01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:40.240]   No, Leo's joking.
[01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:41.240]   How old is this?
[01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:42.240]   I'm sorry.
[01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:43.240]   World.
[01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:44.240]   It's Jason.
[01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:45.240]   How old is brother?
[01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:46.240]   That's who it is.
[01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:51.240]   Anyway, he's been trying desperately to get people to dig up the landfill because the hard
[01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:52.240]   drives in there.
[01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:53.240]   Oh, yeah.
[01:35:53.240 --> 01:35:55.240]   I think I remember him saying, I just try not to think of it now.
[01:35:55.240 --> 01:35:56.240]   I don't know.
[01:35:56.240 --> 01:35:57.240]   He got divorced over it.
[01:35:57.240 --> 01:35:58.240]   Oh.
[01:35:58.240 --> 01:36:03.000]   Well, our own Steve Gibson, who in the early days of Bitcoin, we did a whole episode on
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:09.480]   and he was entranced by as am I still, the mathematics of it, the cleverness of, you know,
[01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:14.320]   the blockchain and what Satoshi had put together was quite, you know, a lot of forethought.
[01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:15.480]   Brilliant idea.
[01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:19.320]   And so he said, well, let me create a Bitcoin mining rig and just see what happens.
[01:36:19.320 --> 01:36:23.160]   The next morning he gets up 50 Bitcoin fell out of it.
[01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:24.160]   50.
[01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:25.160]   Wow.
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:28.360]   He has since he didn't, you know, because it was worth maybe a hundred bucks or something
[01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:29.360]   at the time.
[01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:30.360]   Yeah.
[01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:31.360]   They put the hard drives.
[01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:35.040]   The hard drives long gone, 50 Bitcoin gone.
[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:40.920]   So I, whenever Steve mentions that, I don't worry so much about my 7.5 Bitcoin.
[01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:44.120]   We're joking about all these lost keys and lost drives and things.
[01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:49.800]   But when you think about other things that people invest in that are not FDIC insured,
[01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:54.680]   they don't have the option of a custodial way of holding those things.
[01:36:54.680 --> 01:36:55.680]   Right.
[01:36:55.680 --> 01:36:56.680]   Right.
[01:36:56.680 --> 01:36:57.680]   Right.
[01:36:57.680 --> 01:37:01.040]   So I mean, at least you could put it in a safe deposit box.
[01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:02.040]   Yeah.
[01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:03.040]   What are you going to do?
[01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:05.600]   Actually hold the share certificates, I guess.
[01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:07.400]   Are you right?
[01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:08.840]   I'm just old enough.
[01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:09.840]   I'm just old enough.
[01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:13.640]   I had some sent to me once because I had some restricted shares, a very small amount in
[01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:14.640]   early startup.
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:18.200]   And I actually had to get the physical shares and do all this weird paperwork.
[01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:20.080]   I was like, oh, this is what they're like.
[01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:23.240]   There is a story about a guy who I've never been able to track down the detail.
[01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:24.240]   Someone told me this.
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:25.400]   So maybe it's apocryphal.
[01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:27.320]   He had worked for a company.
[01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:30.680]   It had the value of the shares are going down so low that he wall-papered his bathroom
[01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:31.680]   with him and he forgot about it.
[01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:35.640]   And one day he's sitting in the bathroom and he realizes the company was sold.
[01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:41.320]   Its fortunes were restored and he steamed them all off his bathroom to exchange them.
[01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:45.400]   If anybody knows the origin of that story, I was told it so many years ago.
[01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:48.760]   It sounds, it could be apocryphal, but I love the notion of sitting there on the John and
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:51.680]   going, oh my God, I'm rich.
[01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:53.120]   I can think of a lot of these.
[01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:57.960]   There's a New York Times article about a German programmer living in San Francisco who put
[01:37:57.960 --> 01:38:02.160]   his wallet on an iron key hard drive that gives you 10 guesses.
[01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:04.040]   The password, he's forgotten it.
[01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:05.440]   He's guessed eight.
[01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:07.080]   He's got two guesses left.
[01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:09.440]   There's about 220 million or was.
[01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:16.960]   Now half the $20 million in currency, he lost the paper where he wrote down the password
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:20.640]   and he only gets two more guesses.
[01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:22.400]   So he's not thinking.
[01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:24.920]   They estimate and I don't know how much we know.
[01:38:24.920 --> 01:38:31.040]   About 20% of all the Bitcoin mind has been somehow lost.
[01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:33.720]   18 and a half million Bitcoin.
[01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:37.840]   It was- Give us a whole new meaning to buried treasure.
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:41.600]   Yeah, stranded wallets, things like that.
[01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:42.600]   Yeah.
[01:38:42.600 --> 01:38:44.560]   Let's take a little break.
[01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:47.840]   Lots more to talk about with our fine panel.
[01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:49.560]   Glenn Fleischman is here.
[01:38:49.560 --> 01:38:56.760]   Glenn.fun with two ends in the Glenn and one end in the fun for all of the stuff he does.
[01:38:56.760 --> 01:39:01.000]   We're going to talk about that thing you just bought, which is very cool.
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:02.000]   It's exciting.
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:03.760]   A little bit later on.
[01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:05.400]   Denise Howell is also here.
[01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:12.680]   The internet's lawyer, Denise Howell.info and brand new to our panel, but very welcome,
[01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:16.240]   Kaitlyn McGarry of News Editor of Protocol.
[01:39:16.240 --> 01:39:23.760]   I want to show you all my blue land because we were talking about plastics and it's, you
[01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:30.760]   know, what- I was talking with Rod Pyle, who does our This Week in Space show, about
[01:39:30.760 --> 01:39:37.600]   Bakelite, which was a plastic embedded in the 1900s that was the precursor to all the
[01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:40.760]   plastics we know today and how it would just crumble.
[01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:46.160]   We've gotten better at making plastics and unfortunately, they get thrown out.
[01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:53.680]   Every year, about five billion plastic, hand-soap and cleaning bottles are thrown away.
[01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:55.400]   That is a lot of plastic.
[01:39:55.400 --> 01:39:59.320]   I am personally in my life trying to get rid of single-use plastics and blue land has
[01:39:59.320 --> 01:40:02.800]   been a really great solution for me.
[01:40:02.800 --> 01:40:06.560]   This is an example of a blue land forever bottle.
[01:40:06.560 --> 01:40:07.560]   It's made of plastic.
[01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:09.080]   Yeah, but the idea is you don't throw it away.
[01:40:09.080 --> 01:40:11.240]   In fact, notice it's empty.
[01:40:11.240 --> 01:40:14.520]   When you get your blue land and they have hand soap, I have the- actually, those are
[01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:16.920]   nice heavy glass so you can pump them.
[01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:20.200]   I have- this is the multi-surface cleaner.
[01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:21.200]   There's window cleaner.
[01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:26.440]   I have blue land tablets for my laundry and my dishwasher.
[01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:31.080]   They even have oxy tablets for like bleach but not bleach.
[01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:34.520]   All of it is environmentally friendly for a couple of reasons.
[01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:38.800]   What I'll do is I'll fill up this multi-surface bottle with warm water up to the line.
[01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:41.400]   I'll put in one of these blue land tablets.
[01:40:41.400 --> 01:40:42.400]   They smell great.
[01:40:42.400 --> 01:40:45.320]   This one is- let me see what the set is on this one.
[01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:51.200]   I think this is a parein lemon, I can't remember, but they smell great.
[01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:53.520]   You fill them up and the tablet dissolves.
[01:40:53.520 --> 01:40:56.400]   Now you've got cleaner, good cleaner in this bottle.
[01:40:56.400 --> 01:40:58.320]   You never throw away the bottle.
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:01.360]   It's built to last but you get more tablets.
[01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:05.840]   By the way, the bottles are about $10 when you buy a kit.
[01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:09.240]   The tablet's about $2 and they even have subscriptions.
[01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:15.080]   You can have a refresh plan which we do so I never run out of tablets.
[01:41:15.080 --> 01:41:19.480]   The only thing you're going to have to get rid of is your preconceived notion that eco-friendly
[01:41:19.480 --> 01:41:21.000]   products don't work.
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:22.000]   These work.
[01:41:22.000 --> 01:41:23.760]   They're fantastic.
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:27.960]   A cleaner planet starts by eliminating plastic waste.
[01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:30.200]   Powerful, effective cleaners for your entire home.
[01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:36.280]   By the way, there's another form of waste that comes with all those cleaning bottles.
[01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:39.160]   The stuff in the bottle is about 90% water.
[01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:41.960]   The active ingredient is 10%.
[01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:48.080]   That means we're spending a lot of money to have trucks bring water around instead of
[01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:52.800]   just delivering the active ingredient in a tablet which you add your own water to.
[01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:53.800]   That's another way.
[01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:57.680]   Blue land is really environmentally friendly.
[01:41:57.680 --> 01:41:59.600]   Beautiful Instagrammable bottles.
[01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:00.920]   Fill them with warm water.
[01:42:00.920 --> 01:42:03.800]   Pop in the hand soap or spray cleaner tablets.
[01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:05.960]   Within minutes you have powerful cleaning products.
[01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:09.960]   In amazing sense, Iris Agave, Perine, Lemon, Lavender, Eucalyptus.
[01:42:09.960 --> 01:42:13.240]   I got the Christmas package last Christmas.
[01:42:13.240 --> 01:42:16.640]   I smelled like a gingerbread house for a whole couple of weeks.
[01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:18.040]   It was wonderful.
[01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:19.240]   Peppermint.
[01:42:19.240 --> 01:42:21.120]   They have new scents all the time.
[01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:22.120]   They're unscented.
[01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:24.320]   In fact, we use their unscented laundry detergent.
[01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:26.120]   It's really great.
[01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:28.720]   Blue land even sells wool balls.
[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:32.680]   We have three wool balls we put in the dryer that reduce static without those wasteful
[01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:34.480]   static sheets.
[01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:36.480]   They work great.
[01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:40.480]   Very popular, the Blue Land Toilet Tablet Cleaner.
[01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:41.840]   You throw in a tablet.
[01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:43.560]   You let it dissolve.
[01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:44.560]   Scrub it with a brush.
[01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:45.840]   You're done.
[01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:48.400]   They sell out like crazy because they're so good.
[01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:52.800]   You can get a kit from the Clean Essentials kit to their hand soap duo, the plastic-free
[01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:54.800]   laundry and dishwasher tablets.
[01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:57.040]   I actually, they make a great housewarming gift.
[01:42:57.040 --> 01:43:00.920]   I gave the complete set to my daughter when she moved into her new apartment.
[01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:02.080]   It's so great.
[01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:03.080]   It's so great.
[01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:05.000]   Bottles started just $10 when you buy a kit.
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.280]   The tablet's just a couple of bucks.
[01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:08.320]   Try Blue Land today.
[01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:09.440]   You will love it.

[01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:13.080]   It's got great ingredients.
[01:43:13.080 --> 01:43:14.080]   It's great all around.
[01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:15.360]   It makes you feel good.

[01:43:24.580 --> 01:43:26.160]   We use the dish soap.
[01:43:26.160 --> 01:43:29.040]   It's a powder and it comes in that middle bottle in there.
[01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:30.040]   It's a little plastic bottle.
[01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:31.040]   You shake it out.
[01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:32.360]   It's great.
[01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:34.080]   And then you just refill the bottle with more dish.
[01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:35.240]   It's so great.
[01:43:35.240 --> 01:43:37.600]   BlueLand.com/twit.
[01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:41.960]   20% off your first order of any Blue Land product.
[01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:43.440]   I couldn't recommend it more highly.
[01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:45.360]   It makes me feel really good.
[01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:47.440]   Refill is the new recycle.

[01:43:49.760 --> 01:43:52.760]   Thank you, BlueLand, for a great product
[01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:54.920]   and for supporting Twit.
[01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:55.760]   Let's see.
[01:43:55.760 --> 01:43:58.000]   What else is going on?
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.560]   The Royal Mail is going to deliver
[01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:06.920]   mail to the Rural Remote Islands via drone.
[01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:10.840]   The first communities to benefit the aisles of silly.
[01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:14.120]   It's a very modern Python name.
[01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:18.080]   The Scottish Islands of Shetland, Orkney and the Hebrides.
[01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:20.440]   50 drone routes.
[01:44:20.440 --> 01:44:22.000]   They're actually pretty big drones.
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:25.000]   They can hold a significant amount of mail.
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.760]   100 kilograms, 220 pounds of mail.
[01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:30.600]   Do two routes a day, two round trips a day.
[01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:33.000]   They don't say in this article, good article from Engadget,
[01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:36.520]   but they don't say in the article how they deliver it.
[01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:38.440]   Do they just drop it out the back?
[01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:40.240]   I feel like they might.
[01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:41.120]   I don't know.
[01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:44.640]   Or put a parachute on it.
[01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:46.320]   All it says is after the drone arrives,
[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:48.480]   its destination a postal worker retrieves the mail.
[01:44:48.480 --> 01:44:50.400]   Maybe they land.
[01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:51.240]   Maybe they land.
[01:44:51.240 --> 01:44:52.960]   It can withstand difficult weather conditions
[01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:54.720]   with its autopilot system.
[01:44:54.720 --> 01:44:57.800]   Wingspan of 10 meters.
[01:44:57.800 --> 01:44:59.760]   Pretty cool.
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:01.120]   Nothing to say about it, but--
[01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:04.880]   Maybe it just prevents them from using trucks and planes
[01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:05.960]   and boats and things to deliver the mail.
[01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:07.000]   They have to use boats.
[01:45:07.000 --> 01:45:08.040]   Yeah, these are all--
[01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:09.760]   We're pretty remote islands.
[01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:12.000]   Yeah, maybe they have a central delivery point
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.320]   and then everybody gets their delivery point.
[01:45:14.320 --> 01:45:16.320]   Oh, yeah, it doesn't go to you individually.
[01:45:16.320 --> 01:45:16.760]   Yeah.
[01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:18.960]   Although apparently that's what Amazon's doing, which
[01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:20.560]   is really weird.
[01:45:20.560 --> 01:45:24.240]   Have you seen their sky hook drones where they lower your package
[01:45:24.240 --> 01:45:26.600]   than you need to release it?
[01:45:26.600 --> 01:45:27.400]   And then it goes on?
[01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:27.960]   It's a gimmick.
[01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:29.920]   And it's got to be a gimmick.
[01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:32.160]   I got a good UK Royal Mail story though, sort of.
[01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:34.600]   It's a UK story that's related, which is a few months
[01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:38.440]   ago I got an email from a guy who sees somebody else I know,
[01:45:38.440 --> 01:45:40.520]   in the Mac world saying, I got this problem.
[01:45:40.520 --> 01:45:41.440]   I live in Wales.
[01:45:41.440 --> 01:45:44.920]   And whenever Apple adds new addresses
[01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:48.160]   get added in the UK, like flats of building anywhere in the UK,
[01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:49.480]   they put them at my address.
[01:45:49.480 --> 01:45:51.040]   Apple Maps does.
[01:45:51.040 --> 01:45:54.080]   So I have people showing up sometimes many times a week
[01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:55.800]   driving down my muddy driveway because he's
[01:45:55.800 --> 01:45:57.200]   in a slightly rural part of Wales.
[01:45:57.200 --> 01:45:58.440]   Is there anything I can do about this?
[01:45:58.440 --> 01:45:59.800]   And we don't know anybody in Apple.
[01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:01.080]   We try to get in touch with people
[01:46:01.080 --> 01:46:02.120]   and pass it along.
[01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:04.760]   Eventually, months later, it apparently resolved itself.
[01:46:04.760 --> 01:46:07.040]   But literally, they would put up a building with the flats.
[01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:09.520]   And the Royal Mail would assign out new zip codes,
[01:46:09.520 --> 01:46:11.160]   new postal codes rather.
[01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:15.360]   And Apple's mapping team, that was the zero point.
[01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:18.960]   Like there was a couple was in Kansas who sued Google
[01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:21.040]   or someone because people kept showing up.
[01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:22.480]   Because they were that kind of thing.
[01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:25.080]   So it was just like that except in rural Wales.
[01:46:25.080 --> 01:46:25.880]   So people would drive.
[01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:28.840]   They'd be going to obviously a building full of flats.
[01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:30.840]   And they would be driving to rural Wales
[01:46:30.840 --> 01:46:32.720]   and show up at this guy's house.
[01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:34.480]   He and his wife were very perturbed about it.
[01:46:34.480 --> 01:46:37.280]   But it was resolved before I could forward him
[01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:39.640]   to a journalist to write a major story.
[01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:41.880]   It's funny because yeah, Kashmir Hill did that story
[01:46:41.880 --> 01:46:43.480]   in the New York Times about that.
[01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:45.240]   Poor Kansas farm.
[01:46:45.240 --> 01:46:46.560]   Oh my gosh.
[01:46:46.560 --> 01:46:55.240]   This is the problem with geo IP location is if your IP address
[01:46:55.240 --> 01:47:00.640]   doesn't show a real location, they just put you in the middle.
[01:47:00.640 --> 01:47:02.800]   It's kind of the random location.
[01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:04.880]   And so Kashmir Hill wrote this story, which
[01:47:04.880 --> 01:47:08.920]   is hysterical, about how an internet mapping glitch turned
[01:47:08.920 --> 01:47:11.600]   a random Kansas farm into a digital hell.
[01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:13.680]   People would drop off.
[01:47:13.680 --> 01:47:15.480]   They'd say, you stole my iPhone.
[01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:17.080]   No, I know.
[01:47:17.080 --> 01:47:18.720]   I know because it's on Find My iPhone.
[01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:19.440]   It's this house.
[01:47:19.440 --> 01:47:22.520]   No, it's just because we're the default.
[01:47:22.520 --> 01:47:24.160]   So this happened years ago.
[01:47:24.160 --> 01:47:26.640]   I guess it's happened again.
[01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:31.240]   This started in 2002 when a Massachusetts based digital mapping
[01:47:31.240 --> 01:47:36.760]   company called Maxmine did geo location via IP address.
[01:47:36.760 --> 01:47:38.360]   And if they couldn't figure out where it was,
[01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:40.520]   they put you in Wichita.
[01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:43.560]   This guy was in Wales was lucky because only new addresses.
[01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:45.480]   So it wasn't a fall.
[01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:48.680]   But it was still they're building stuff in England and Wales.
[01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:50.560]   Yeah, there's a lot of new stuff.
[01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:51.960]   Yeah.
[01:47:51.960 --> 01:47:55.400]   Kashmir says, I do up the best story I've ever written
[01:47:55.400 --> 01:47:57.360]   doesn't go offline with the death of splinter.
[01:47:57.360 --> 01:47:59.280]   She's at the New York Times now.
[01:47:59.280 --> 01:47:59.960]   Oh, yeah.
[01:47:59.960 --> 01:48:02.080]   What is splinter news?
[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:02.760]   Was that was she?
[01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:05.720]   I was that that was Docker media's like,
[01:48:05.720 --> 01:48:11.600]   oh, yeah, look, there's a lot of broken images now.
[01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:13.640]   But the day the articles are still there.
[01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:16.960]   But their images, a lot of the images are broken.
[01:48:16.960 --> 01:48:21.560]   Yeah, you know, I wrote my first article about link rot in 1997.
[01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:23.960]   It's a lot more rotten now.
[01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:25.960]   You knew you knew it was coming.
[01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:27.080]   Oh, wow.
[01:48:27.080 --> 01:48:27.440]   Wow.
[01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:28.080]   It's already happening.
[01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:28.880]   Yeah.
[01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:30.240]   Link rot.
[01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:31.080]   That's a good name for it.
[01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:37.640]   Speaking of rotting corpses and carcasses, the iPod is dead.
[01:48:37.640 --> 01:48:40.720]   That's got a good rim way to put it.
[01:48:40.720 --> 01:48:41.680]   Wow.
[01:48:41.680 --> 01:48:42.240]   Wow.
[01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:43.240]   Have a good run.
[01:48:43.240 --> 01:48:44.200]   They had a good run.
[01:48:44.200 --> 01:48:47.000]   The first iPod came out in October 2001.
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:49.840]   The last iPod, the iPod Touch Apple,
[01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:52.560]   has announced they will make no more.
[01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:57.120]   Actually, what they said is something like,
[01:48:57.120 --> 01:49:00.960]   while supplies last, you can order an iPod Touch,
[01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:04.920]   the implication being, they ain't going to last much longer.
[01:49:04.920 --> 01:49:09.000]   It's all over for the iPod Touch, all over for the iPod,
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:13.280]   which was a revolutionary product
[01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:15.120]   that in many ways saved Apple.
[01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:16.520]   Again, I'm reading this great trip,
[01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:18.600]   Mickle Book after Stephenie.
[01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:20.760]   And he talks about, remember Apple
[01:49:20.760 --> 01:49:25.800]   was 100 days away from bankruptcy under Gil Emelio,
[01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:27.400]   right in the mid 90s.
[01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:29.800]   They were just dead meat.
[01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:35.080]   Because first Scully drives him in one direction,
[01:49:35.080 --> 01:49:37.920]   then Hare Spindler, Michael Spindler comes in,
[01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:39.280]   and he does other things.
[01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:41.960]   And then Gil Emelio is brought in by the board
[01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:42.920]   to save the company.
[01:49:42.920 --> 01:49:44.640]   And he had no idea what he was doing.
[01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:47.080]   And by the end of those three, there
[01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:49.520]   was not much left after they fired Steve Jobs.
[01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:51.280]   But the one thing Emelio did that was smart,
[01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:52.600]   he brought Steve Jobs back.
[01:49:52.600 --> 01:49:54.160]   He bought Next.
[01:49:54.160 --> 01:49:57.720]   And Steve came in, swooped in, saved the company,
[01:49:57.720 --> 01:50:03.080]   first by making the beautiful Bondi Blue iMac, which
[01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:04.560]   didn't sell very well.
[01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:08.720]   But I think it's probably the case that four years later,
[01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:12.560]   when the iPod came out, that was when Apple really
[01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:13.480]   started its climb.
[01:50:13.480 --> 01:50:15.680]   And of course, it was really the precursor
[01:50:15.680 --> 01:50:18.560]   for the iPhone six years later.
[01:50:18.560 --> 01:50:22.640]   So the beginning of creating the most valuable company
[01:50:22.640 --> 01:50:24.720]   in the world, actually, it's no longer
[01:50:24.720 --> 01:50:27.560]   the most valuable company in the world.
[01:50:27.560 --> 01:50:30.000]   I think who's the BP who's somebody is now?
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:32.000]   Saudi Aramco.
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:33.560]   OK.
[01:50:33.560 --> 01:50:34.080]   Sorry.
[01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:36.040]   Yeah, I remember getting the first iPod for review.
[01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:38.520]   I was running freelance for the Seattle Times at the time.
[01:50:38.520 --> 01:50:40.960]   So Apple was like-- and Apple was no big shake.
[01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:42.680]   And they're like, hey, you want to review this thing?
[01:50:42.680 --> 01:50:45.160]   Before it comes out, I said, sure.
[01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:48.480]   And I promptly broke it by sticking in a too long
[01:50:48.480 --> 01:50:49.560]   eighth-inch adapter.
[01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:51.400]   And they were like, OK, we'll send you another one.
[01:50:51.400 --> 01:50:52.160]   We'll send you another one.
[01:50:52.160 --> 01:50:54.920]   You had no idea how valuable those were.
[01:50:54.920 --> 01:50:55.420]   No.
[01:50:55.420 --> 01:50:56.440]   So I sent it back.
[01:50:56.440 --> 01:50:57.360]   They sent me another one.
[01:50:57.360 --> 01:50:59.240]   And I handed it to my niece was--
[01:50:59.240 --> 01:51:01.280]   she 13 or 14 at the time.
[01:51:01.280 --> 01:51:03.080]   I said, here, see what you can do with this.
[01:51:03.080 --> 01:51:04.920]   And she immediately, within five seconds,
[01:51:04.920 --> 01:51:06.000]   had music playing out of it.
[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:07.920]   And I'm like, there it is.
[01:51:07.920 --> 01:51:10.480]   And I think the iPad, one of its unique characteristics,
[01:51:10.480 --> 01:51:13.080]   was that it never stopped being cool for its kind
[01:51:13.080 --> 01:51:15.960]   of primary lifetime before the iPhone took over.
[01:51:15.960 --> 01:51:20.920]   You could be 5 or 10 or 17 or 85.
[01:51:20.920 --> 01:51:24.280]   And it still wasn't not cool because adults were using it.
[01:51:24.280 --> 01:51:26.320]   It was-- I don't know if there's another product that's
[01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:27.400]   quite like that.
[01:51:27.400 --> 01:51:30.960]   Here is from 2001, the very first--
[01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:33.160]   I think I could show this now.
[01:51:33.160 --> 01:51:35.760]   The statute of limitations is inspired.
[01:51:35.760 --> 01:51:36.240]   I don't know.
[01:51:36.240 --> 01:51:37.480]   Is this the panic thing?
[01:51:37.480 --> 01:51:38.560]   This is the very-- no, no, no.
[01:51:38.560 --> 01:51:41.360]   This is the very first I thought commercial.
[01:51:41.360 --> 01:51:41.920]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:48.360]   A guy sitting at his white MacBook Pro.
[01:51:48.360 --> 01:51:50.040]   He's dancing to the music.
[01:51:50.040 --> 01:51:52.040]   And this was, I think, before they used real music.
[01:51:52.040 --> 01:51:53.760]   So I think I can show this.
[01:51:53.760 --> 01:51:56.000]   This is just some random drum track.
[01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:57.480]   There he is with iTunes.
[01:51:57.480 --> 01:52:00.360]   He really loves-- oh, no, it's maybe the Superpellerheads.
[01:52:00.360 --> 01:52:01.680]   He really loves this song.
[01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:03.160]   What is that he's copying?
[01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:04.640]   He's using Firewire.
[01:52:04.640 --> 01:52:07.440]   What?
[01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:09.720]   And now, the same song--
[01:52:09.720 --> 01:52:12.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:14.200]   And he's dancing out the door.
[01:52:14.200 --> 01:52:17.760]   This was the famous "thousand songs" in your pocket.
[01:52:17.760 --> 01:52:21.120]   This predates the really legendary iPod ads,
[01:52:21.120 --> 01:52:24.280]   which were the black silhouettes with the white headphones.
[01:52:24.280 --> 01:52:26.240]   But it did have the dancing in there.
[01:52:26.240 --> 01:52:27.200]   Oh, I love this one.
[01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:30.000]   It's better, even, than the black silhouettes.
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:34.000]   Yeah, going out of his, clearly, a Brooklyn apartment.
[01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:36.440]   And he's got the "thousand songs" in his pocket.
[01:52:36.440 --> 01:52:37.160]   A thousand songs?
[01:52:37.160 --> 01:52:39.200]   OK, he's no AKA twigs, but still.
[01:52:39.200 --> 01:52:39.680]   Yeah.
[01:52:39.680 --> 01:52:42.320]   And they still were using "Think Different" back in the day.
[01:52:42.320 --> 01:52:42.820]   Wow.
[01:52:42.820 --> 01:52:45.240]   The statute of limitations never runs.
[01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:49.000]   And to the extent that copyrighted music triggers--
[01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:49.920]   I'm dead.
[01:52:49.920 --> 01:52:50.920]   They're going to take me down.
[01:52:50.920 --> 01:52:52.320]   Then it'll get taken down.
[01:52:52.320 --> 01:52:54.760]   But this is fair use, because we are doing commentaries--
[01:52:54.760 --> 01:52:56.600]   We're commentaring on top of it.
[01:52:56.600 --> 01:52:58.520]   Deep iPod.
[01:52:58.520 --> 01:53:01.280]   But as you well know, fair use is--
[01:53:01.280 --> 01:53:02.920]   --is it the central two are--
[01:53:02.920 --> 01:53:03.720]   That's right.
[01:53:03.720 --> 01:53:05.880]   That's right.
[01:53:05.880 --> 01:53:07.920]   Remember, there were some moments with the iPod
[01:53:07.920 --> 01:53:10.280]   that we'll never forget like iPod socks.
[01:53:10.280 --> 01:53:14.040]   Right?
[01:53:14.040 --> 01:53:14.480]   Yeah.
[01:53:14.480 --> 01:53:17.640]   I have forgotten until you sent that phrase.
[01:53:17.640 --> 01:53:19.120]   The iPod high-fi.
[01:53:19.120 --> 01:53:22.240]   That's so good that Steve Jobs said he was throwing out
[01:53:22.240 --> 01:53:27.000]   his millions of dollars of iPod equipment--
[01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:28.600]   of stereo equipment.
[01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:31.360]   I don't think Steve did.
[01:53:31.360 --> 01:53:35.120]   But yeah, it's really the end of an era.
[01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:40.160]   The last iPod, the iPod Touch, will no longer be manufactured,
[01:53:40.160 --> 01:53:42.720]   because everybody's got an iPhone or--
[01:53:42.720 --> 01:53:44.000]   And now everybody's streaming.
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:47.600]   It doesn't really-- you don't need to store music anymore.
[01:53:47.600 --> 01:53:48.680]   You have a--
[01:53:48.680 --> 01:53:49.920]   It's really upsetting.
[01:53:49.920 --> 01:53:55.840]   One of our Gen Z co-workers was like--
[01:53:55.840 --> 01:53:58.520]   The iPod Touch was the first device
[01:53:58.520 --> 01:54:01.000]   that I took my first selfie on.
[01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:02.000]   And I was like--
[01:54:02.000 --> 01:54:03.800]   Oh, wow.
[01:54:03.800 --> 01:54:07.040]   I was like, in my day, the iPod did not have a camera.
[01:54:07.040 --> 01:54:11.040]   Do you remember your first iPod, Kaylin?
[01:54:11.040 --> 01:54:13.680]   My first iPod was the blue iPod mini.
[01:54:13.680 --> 01:54:15.400]   Ooh.
[01:54:15.400 --> 01:54:16.680]   It was very stylish.
[01:54:16.680 --> 01:54:19.240]   I got it for Christmas.
[01:54:19.240 --> 01:54:20.960]   I remember-- I was in college.
[01:54:20.960 --> 01:54:23.400]   I took it with me everywhere.
[01:54:23.400 --> 01:54:26.800]   And then eventually I had to upgrade to the iPod Classic,
[01:54:26.800 --> 01:54:29.000]   because I needed more space for all the songs.
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:32.520]   I was definitely downloading legally.
[01:54:32.520 --> 01:54:33.880]   From Napster.
[01:54:33.880 --> 01:54:34.760]   Yeah, I remember that.
[01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:36.600]   Yeah.
[01:54:36.600 --> 01:54:37.240]   These were great.
[01:54:37.240 --> 01:54:39.760]   These iPod minis were really-- they were aluminum,
[01:54:39.760 --> 01:54:41.000]   which was a big--
[01:54:41.000 --> 01:54:44.280]   the original iPods were polycarbonate fronts with steel--
[01:54:44.280 --> 01:54:47.240]   shiny steel backs.
[01:54:47.240 --> 01:54:49.680]   They got rid of the spinning click wheel by this time.
[01:54:49.680 --> 01:54:53.720]   So it was just a little wheel.
[01:54:53.720 --> 01:54:55.040]   This is from PC Magazine.
[01:54:55.040 --> 01:54:59.880]   They have a whole history of the iPod at PCMag.com.
[01:54:59.880 --> 01:55:02.320]   There's the iPod Nano and Steve Jobs.
[01:55:02.320 --> 01:55:03.360]   Your hands.
[01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:06.200]   You'll never be able to play video on an iPod.
[01:55:06.200 --> 01:55:07.040]   He said that.
[01:55:07.040 --> 01:55:08.040]   Yeah.
[01:55:08.040 --> 01:55:08.560]   Ever.
[01:55:08.560 --> 01:55:10.080]   Until you can.
[01:55:10.080 --> 01:55:13.960]   In fact, that's when we learned that Steve will say anything.
[01:55:13.960 --> 01:55:16.680]   You can't do that until you can.
[01:55:16.680 --> 01:55:17.240]   So let's time.
[01:55:17.240 --> 01:55:20.440]   Yeah, remember the iPod Shuffle that had no--
[01:55:20.440 --> 01:55:21.000]   That was great.
[01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:21.680]   Yeah.
[01:55:21.680 --> 01:55:23.360]   Basically no control, no screen.
[01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:25.720]   You just-- you played what you played.
[01:55:25.720 --> 01:55:26.220]   Yeah.
[01:55:26.220 --> 01:55:27.160]   I had a couple of those.
[01:55:27.160 --> 01:55:27.720]   Those were great.
[01:55:27.720 --> 01:55:30.640]   One looked like a sticker gum, right?
[01:55:30.640 --> 01:55:32.920]   And then they got one that was a clip that you clipped on.
[01:55:32.920 --> 01:55:34.920]   Yeah, I thought they were great.
[01:55:34.920 --> 01:55:35.400]   The--
[01:55:35.400 --> 01:55:38.480]   We still have one of the iPhone precursors, the ones
[01:55:38.480 --> 01:55:39.200]   that looked like--
[01:55:39.200 --> 01:55:39.720]   The touch.
[01:55:39.720 --> 01:55:40.360]   --the iPhone.
[01:55:40.360 --> 01:55:40.880]   Yeah.
[01:55:40.880 --> 01:55:45.200]   The iPod touch that was my son's when he was little.
[01:55:45.200 --> 01:55:48.440]   And when we were going through the spring cleaning
[01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:50.240]   the house or whatever, he stumbled across it.
[01:55:50.240 --> 01:55:50.920]   We still have it.
[01:55:50.920 --> 01:55:52.320]   It still works.
[01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:56.120]   But the apps are no longer supported.
[01:55:56.120 --> 01:55:58.560]   So a lot of them don't work.
[01:55:58.560 --> 01:55:59.760]   But a lot of them do.
[01:55:59.760 --> 01:56:02.280]   I mean, like to the extent they're just accessing whatever
[01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:03.680]   is on that device.
[01:56:03.680 --> 01:56:07.000]   And it was so nostalgic for him to go, oh, I remember this
[01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:08.920]   from when I was five.
[01:56:08.920 --> 01:56:11.640]   Yeah, periodically, we'll get out my original iPod, which
[01:56:11.640 --> 01:56:13.640]   I still have in my museum over here.
[01:56:13.640 --> 01:56:17.920]   You have to find a firewire cable to charge it up.
[01:56:17.920 --> 01:56:21.120]   And yes, it's Britney Spears, because I guess I was really
[01:56:21.120 --> 01:56:23.040]   in his--
[01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:25.120]   I think my kids got some music on my iPod.
[01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:26.800]   I think that's my real--
[01:56:26.800 --> 01:56:28.360]   Like a likely story.
[01:56:28.360 --> 01:56:30.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:56:30.440 --> 01:56:32.960]   Exactly.
[01:56:32.960 --> 01:56:36.440]   Ads are coming to Netflix.
[01:56:36.440 --> 01:56:38.400]   And Netflix tells its employees, maybe as soon
[01:56:38.400 --> 01:56:41.000]   as the end of the year.
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:43.880]   Is this the way to save Netflix is starting to show?
[01:56:43.880 --> 01:56:46.120]   I think the reason people subscribe to Netflix
[01:56:46.120 --> 01:56:48.520]   is so they don't have to see ads.
[01:56:48.520 --> 01:56:49.920]   100% agree with you.
[01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:53.520]   And nothing irks us more than turning on Paramount Plus
[01:56:53.520 --> 01:56:57.080]   and being confronted with pre-roll when we're paying
[01:56:57.080 --> 01:56:58.200]   for that service.
[01:56:58.200 --> 01:56:59.960]   Like, no.
[01:56:59.960 --> 01:57:02.240]   That's paying for it means you don't get that.
[01:57:02.240 --> 01:57:05.840]   Well, if you pay more, you could get rid of them.
[01:57:05.840 --> 01:57:07.160]   I don't-- can you?
[01:57:07.160 --> 01:57:07.640]   Yeah.
[01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:09.560]   I think I'm paying everything I can pay.
[01:57:09.560 --> 01:57:10.680]   Oh, really?
[01:57:10.680 --> 01:57:11.360]   I think so.
[01:57:11.360 --> 01:57:13.360]   I think you can pay more.
[01:57:13.360 --> 01:57:13.880]   Hulu.
[01:57:13.880 --> 01:57:15.840]   And I think it's what Netflix will do.
[01:57:15.840 --> 01:57:19.480]   They all have low priced tiers where you watch ads, which
[01:57:19.480 --> 01:57:20.480]   is a horrible experience.
[01:57:20.480 --> 01:57:23.640]   At least it used to be, because they didn't have very many ads.
[01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:26.480]   So you'd see the same ad over and over again.
[01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:28.000]   They're not third party ads.
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:29.960]   They're Paramount Plus ads.
[01:57:29.960 --> 01:57:30.320]   Right.
[01:57:30.320 --> 01:57:31.240]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:57:31.240 --> 01:57:33.160]   So annoying.
[01:57:33.160 --> 01:57:35.840]   So annoying.
[01:57:35.840 --> 01:57:37.480]   So I guess that's what Netflix is going to do,
[01:57:37.480 --> 01:57:39.840]   because it works so well for the other guys.
[01:57:39.840 --> 01:57:43.280]   What has gone wrong with Netflix?
[01:57:43.280 --> 01:57:48.600]   I mean, Netflix just banked on being the only player
[01:57:48.600 --> 01:57:50.080]   for a really long time.
[01:57:50.080 --> 01:57:52.600]   Like, it didn't really have a lot of competition.
[01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:56.000]   And now, every other streaming service
[01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:58.360]   also has really good original content
[01:57:58.360 --> 01:58:02.920]   and pretty good library of older content that they own.
[01:58:02.920 --> 01:58:05.720]   And now it's like, I don't need to pay for Netflix
[01:58:05.720 --> 01:58:06.600]   every single month.
[01:58:06.600 --> 01:58:09.400]   Maybe I just subscribe on a month when everyone's talking
[01:58:09.400 --> 01:58:10.480]   about the show I want to watch.
[01:58:10.480 --> 01:58:14.760]   And you can kind of pick and choose how you subscribe.
[01:58:14.760 --> 01:58:17.640]   And they also keep raising prices, which
[01:58:17.640 --> 01:58:23.120]   is kind of ridiculous when no one else is raising prices.
[01:58:23.120 --> 01:58:25.240]   And then you have Disney Plus, which just
[01:58:25.240 --> 01:58:27.240]   owns children and their parents.
[01:58:27.240 --> 01:58:30.560]   And that's a disastrous combination.
[01:58:30.560 --> 01:58:34.400]   Even Apple TV Plus is getting better and better.
[01:58:34.400 --> 01:58:36.160]   I wasn't impressed in the early days,
[01:58:36.160 --> 01:58:38.240]   but severance is very good.
[01:58:38.240 --> 01:58:38.960]   Slow horses.
[01:58:38.960 --> 01:58:40.800]   Isn't slow horses great?
[01:58:40.800 --> 01:58:41.440]   Really?
[01:58:41.440 --> 01:58:43.400]   They're doing stuff now at a level
[01:58:43.400 --> 01:58:45.880]   to compete very well with Netflix and Amazon Prime.
[01:58:45.880 --> 01:58:49.200]   The other problem Netflix has is unlike Apple and Amazon,
[01:58:49.200 --> 01:58:52.640]   they have to make all their money on subscriptions.
[01:58:52.640 --> 01:58:55.080]   Apple can lose money on Apple TV Plus.
[01:58:55.080 --> 01:58:57.640]   Amazon can lose money on Amazon Prime
[01:58:57.640 --> 01:59:00.120]   because it supports their other service
[01:59:00.120 --> 01:59:02.600]   and their other businesses.
[01:59:02.600 --> 01:59:04.600]   Do you get the sense when you're scrolling through Netflix
[01:59:04.600 --> 01:59:07.320]   that they're actually creating the programs as you go right?
[01:59:07.320 --> 01:59:08.240]   You go right.
[01:59:08.240 --> 01:59:10.280]   And more and more and more and more improbable stuff
[01:59:10.280 --> 01:59:10.960]   starts to appear.
[01:59:10.960 --> 01:59:12.400]   You're like, is that a real show?
[01:59:12.400 --> 01:59:13.840]   Make up some stuff quick, you're scrolling right.
[01:59:13.840 --> 01:59:16.960]   If I click, you're just like, that can't be real is it?
[01:59:16.960 --> 01:59:17.920]   And then you click through and you're
[01:59:17.920 --> 01:59:19.600]   like, there's four seasons of this.
[01:59:19.600 --> 01:59:20.560]   I've never heard about it.
[01:59:20.560 --> 01:59:21.280]   They do a good job.
[01:59:21.280 --> 01:59:22.960]   I mean, they do a good job of, I think,
[01:59:22.960 --> 01:59:25.160]   understanding what people want to watch.
[01:59:25.160 --> 01:59:26.960]   But I think they've leaned into, heavily,
[01:59:26.960 --> 01:59:29.520]   into the algorithm because it starts to get--
[01:59:29.520 --> 01:59:30.840]   the shows they've commissioned start
[01:59:30.840 --> 01:59:32.680]   to get very weird and specific.
[01:59:32.680 --> 01:59:34.440]   Like an AI gone wrong.
[01:59:34.440 --> 01:59:37.080]   So maybe they need more human and all of that.
[01:59:37.080 --> 01:59:40.520]   I mean, I'm sure we've all been sort of doomscroll
[01:59:40.520 --> 01:59:42.360]   to Netflix or Hulu or Amazon Prime.
[01:59:42.360 --> 01:59:44.160]   You're like, where did this come from?
[01:59:44.160 --> 01:59:44.680]   It's cool.
[01:59:44.680 --> 01:59:45.680]   Is this maybe more?
[01:59:45.680 --> 01:59:46.080]   Who is this?
[01:59:46.080 --> 01:59:47.440]   Yeah.
[01:59:47.440 --> 01:59:52.440]   I honestly think Netflix should put their investment
[01:59:52.440 --> 01:59:55.720]   into their software, that their actual apps do
[01:59:55.720 --> 02:00:00.640]   a terrible job of recommending--
[02:00:00.640 --> 02:00:03.880]   if you're watching something, it's often not
[02:00:03.880 --> 02:00:05.920]   the first thing that shows up.
[02:00:05.920 --> 02:00:08.400]   So it's hard even to continue watching something
[02:00:08.400 --> 02:00:10.120]   that you watched.
[02:00:10.120 --> 02:00:14.280]   I just think the app is terrible.
[02:00:14.280 --> 02:00:16.880]   There's too many things.
[02:00:16.880 --> 02:00:18.200]   They need to do something.
[02:00:18.200 --> 02:00:21.120]   And I remember they had a prize for a better recommendation
[02:00:21.120 --> 02:00:24.640]   engine, and nobody came up with a better recommendation
[02:00:24.640 --> 02:00:25.480]   engine.
[02:00:25.480 --> 02:00:27.400]   They couldn't do it.
[02:00:27.400 --> 02:00:27.840]   Really?
[02:00:27.840 --> 02:00:30.800]   These are the top 10 movies in the US today.
[02:00:30.800 --> 02:00:32.880]   Senior year?
[02:00:32.880 --> 02:00:33.360]   Wow.
[02:00:33.360 --> 02:00:34.840]   Our father?
[02:00:34.840 --> 02:00:36.160]   I don't know what these shows are.
[02:00:36.160 --> 02:00:37.160]   This I want to watch.
[02:00:37.160 --> 02:00:38.080]   I want to do at least--
[02:00:38.080 --> 02:00:38.920]   Yeah, I'm going to do it.
[02:00:38.920 --> 02:00:40.440]   --marmin because Pete Davidson doing a voice in it,
[02:00:40.440 --> 02:00:40.960]   I think.
[02:00:40.960 --> 02:00:41.480]   All right.
[02:00:41.480 --> 02:00:42.000]   There you go.
[02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:42.480]   Maybe.
[02:00:42.480 --> 02:00:43.480]   Borego.
[02:00:43.480 --> 02:00:44.160]   Borego.
[02:00:44.160 --> 02:00:46.880]   I think this maybe-- this top 10 list, more than anything,
[02:00:46.880 --> 02:00:50.640]   tells you what's wrong at Netflix right now.
[02:00:50.640 --> 02:00:52.680]   But you've also got cross-subsidization going on,
[02:00:52.680 --> 02:00:55.760]   because I've got T-Mobile subsidizes my Netflix account.
[02:00:55.760 --> 02:00:56.920]   So I pay so little.
[02:00:56.920 --> 02:00:58.160]   I actually don't cancel it.
[02:00:58.160 --> 02:01:00.240]   Disney+ subsidizes Hulu.
[02:01:00.240 --> 02:01:01.040]   Maybe that's a solution.
[02:01:01.040 --> 02:01:01.680]   T-Mobile's now--
[02:01:01.680 --> 02:01:02.160]   Yeah.
[02:01:02.160 --> 02:01:03.400]   --subsidizing Paramount+.
[02:01:03.400 --> 02:01:05.880]   So I only pay a fraction of what--
[02:01:05.880 --> 02:01:07.200]   I mean, I think we have five services.
[02:01:07.200 --> 02:01:09.520]   We have Amazon Prime, because we still
[02:01:09.520 --> 02:01:10.960]   have their delivery deal.
[02:01:10.960 --> 02:01:14.320]   So I don't think I really pay directly 100% for anything
[02:01:14.320 --> 02:01:15.320]   but Disney+.
[02:01:15.320 --> 02:01:17.680]   And we watch the heck out of it, so why not?
[02:01:17.680 --> 02:01:21.840]   There's another problem in the long run for Netflix, which
[02:01:21.840 --> 02:01:25.280]   is for a long time, they spent, I think, $11 billion
[02:01:25.280 --> 02:01:27.280]   last year on original content.
[02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:28.440]   But they owned the market.
[02:01:28.440 --> 02:01:33.280]   Now, here's Apple TV, getting Academy Award for CODA.
[02:01:33.280 --> 02:01:36.480]   It's going to be a lot harder to convince creators,
[02:01:36.480 --> 02:01:40.440]   like Martin Scorsese to go to Netflix.
[02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:43.160]   Yeah, the money's there, but the Irishman
[02:01:43.160 --> 02:01:48.040]   is buried with 1,000 crappy movies.
[02:01:48.040 --> 02:01:49.840]   And that's not what Scorsese wants.
[02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:52.480]   He wants an Academy Award.
[02:01:52.480 --> 02:01:54.240]   He wants to be featured.
[02:01:54.240 --> 02:01:57.720]   So I have a feeling Netflix's problems are multi-layered.
[02:01:57.720 --> 02:02:00.000]   I honestly think, though, they could do so much better job
[02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:01.120]   with the app.
[02:02:01.120 --> 02:02:03.120]   I just don't feel like the apps are very good.
[02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:05.760]   It's hard to find something good.
[02:02:05.760 --> 02:02:08.520]   Or maybe because there is nothing good.
[02:02:08.520 --> 02:02:11.960]   You want to-- they're looking at live streaming, unscripted
[02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:15.280]   series, stand up specials.
[02:02:15.280 --> 02:02:16.920]   Reality shows like live streaming,
[02:02:16.920 --> 02:02:20.680]   because you can vote while it's airing.
[02:02:20.680 --> 02:02:23.240]   I don't know if that's a good solution for them, either,
[02:02:23.240 --> 02:02:24.840]   honestly.
[02:02:24.840 --> 02:02:27.200]   I'm not sure what I would do if I were in charge.
[02:02:27.200 --> 02:02:32.400]   Meanwhile, Disney+ added 8 million new subscribers.
[02:02:32.400 --> 02:02:34.520]   Is that because they own Star Wars and Marvel?
[02:02:34.520 --> 02:02:38.760]   Is that really the secret there?
[02:02:38.760 --> 02:02:41.680]   It's got to be a huge part of it.
[02:02:41.680 --> 02:02:43.880]   I mean, also, they keep putting out
[02:02:43.880 --> 02:02:45.680]   these really incredible animated movies.
[02:02:45.680 --> 02:02:48.840]   Like everyone I know is watching in Kanto over and over
[02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:50.480]   and over.
[02:02:50.480 --> 02:02:54.760]   So yeah, they've really captivated the all-important kid
[02:02:54.760 --> 02:02:55.600]   audience.
[02:02:55.600 --> 02:02:56.640]   I want somebody to write.
[02:02:56.640 --> 02:02:57.840]   The song's back in my head again.
[02:02:57.840 --> 02:02:58.360]   I know.
[02:02:58.360 --> 02:02:59.960]   I want somebody to write a song.
[02:02:59.960 --> 02:03:02.120]   We don't talk about Elon.
[02:03:02.120 --> 02:03:03.200]   I want that song.
[02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:04.960]   Would somebody please write that song?
[02:03:04.960 --> 02:03:06.080]   That's Randy Rainbow.
[02:03:06.080 --> 02:03:07.080]   We'll do it, I'm sure.
[02:03:07.080 --> 02:03:09.360]   I don't know why he hasn't yet.
[02:03:09.360 --> 02:03:10.000]   It's funny, though.
[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:11.920]   I mean, I just saw an ad on YouTube,
[02:03:11.920 --> 02:03:14.080]   just the way all this cross-fertilization goes.
[02:03:14.080 --> 02:03:16.320]   My 15-year-old and I are watching something.
[02:03:16.320 --> 02:03:18.600]   An ad on YouTube comes up for the most
[02:03:18.600 --> 02:03:21.040]   deranged looking ship and dale movie I've ever seen.
[02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:23.160]   It looks like a Roger Rabbit.
[02:03:23.160 --> 02:03:24.840]   It's just bizarre.
[02:03:24.840 --> 02:03:26.440]   Although I think it's John Mullenian's--
[02:03:26.440 --> 02:03:27.400]   I forget the other person.
[02:03:27.400 --> 02:03:29.080]   There's some prominent voices in it.
[02:03:29.080 --> 02:03:31.640]   And then I discovered it's going to be released in a few days
[02:03:31.640 --> 02:03:32.760]   on Disney Plus.
[02:03:32.760 --> 02:03:34.720]   So it will only be on streaming.
[02:03:34.720 --> 02:03:36.640]   And I thought, well, this is kind of a brilliant strategy.
[02:03:36.640 --> 02:03:37.520]   They caught us.
[02:03:37.520 --> 02:03:39.560]   They figured us out from the YouTube algorithm.
[02:03:39.560 --> 02:03:41.320]   They're pushing us to a service we already
[02:03:41.320 --> 02:03:42.400]   subscribed to.
[02:03:42.400 --> 02:03:43.320]   Maybe they don't know that.
[02:03:43.320 --> 02:03:44.360]   I don't know.
[02:03:44.360 --> 02:03:45.400]   We cheer, by the way.
[02:03:45.400 --> 02:03:46.120]   We watch YouTube.
[02:03:46.120 --> 02:03:49.120]   My 15-year-old and I cheer when it gives us
[02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:50.360]   totally inappropriate ads.
[02:03:50.360 --> 02:03:53.000]   We're like, yeah, they don't know who we are.
[02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:53.920]   Thanks for being here.
[02:03:53.920 --> 02:03:55.440]   We fold them again.
[02:03:55.440 --> 02:03:57.560]   Do you do any active fuzzing?
[02:03:57.560 --> 02:03:59.440]   Or is it just stupid?
[02:03:59.440 --> 02:04:01.280]   No, we just watch all kinds of weird stuff.
[02:04:01.280 --> 02:04:04.480]   We're watching engineering shows and new rock stars.
[02:04:04.480 --> 02:04:05.840]   Breakdowns, videos.
[02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:06.360]   Perfect.
[02:04:06.360 --> 02:04:08.040]   I'm watching German education.
[02:04:08.040 --> 02:04:09.200]   It's just reconfused them.
[02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:10.400]   That's the secret, by the way.
[02:04:10.400 --> 02:04:12.320]   Watch German education videos.
[02:04:12.320 --> 02:04:13.480]   There you go.
[02:04:13.480 --> 02:04:14.440]   That'll look.
[02:04:14.440 --> 02:04:17.360]   What do they advertise to you if you watch those?
[02:04:17.360 --> 02:04:17.720]   I don't know.
[02:04:17.720 --> 02:04:19.440]   They're giving us language tapes or something.
[02:04:19.440 --> 02:04:20.600]   Nothing interesting unfortunately.
[02:04:20.600 --> 02:04:21.600]   No, unfortunately.
[02:04:21.600 --> 02:04:23.720]   They want us to buy an F-150 or something.
[02:04:23.720 --> 02:04:25.440]   They want us to buy a lot of cars.
[02:04:25.440 --> 02:04:26.840]   They really want us to sell us cars.
[02:04:26.840 --> 02:04:28.480]   We have all the cars we need.
[02:04:28.480 --> 02:04:29.440]   You live in Seattle.
[02:04:29.440 --> 02:04:32.280]   You need a pickup truck.
[02:04:32.280 --> 02:04:32.880]   Absolutely.
[02:04:32.880 --> 02:04:33.640]   Let's take a little break.
[02:04:33.640 --> 02:04:34.120]   A little break.
[02:04:34.120 --> 02:04:34.600]   Two.
[02:04:34.600 --> 02:04:35.760]   Have two.
[02:04:35.760 --> 02:04:37.760]   Let's take a little break.
[02:04:37.760 --> 02:04:38.720]   I think it's pretty soon.
[02:04:38.720 --> 02:04:39.800]   It's going to be time to wrap it up.
[02:04:39.800 --> 02:04:43.440]   We have a couple of a few extra little stories.
[02:04:43.440 --> 02:04:45.160]   Usually the fun stuffs at the end of the show
[02:04:45.160 --> 02:04:46.520]   will get you some stuff.
[02:04:46.520 --> 02:04:50.880]   But first a word from ZipRecruiter.
[02:04:50.880 --> 02:04:55.680]   ZipRecruiter is the best way to hire.
[02:04:55.680 --> 02:04:58.960]   Certain people make life so much easier.
[02:04:58.960 --> 02:05:00.640]   People, you just don't know what you do without them.
[02:05:00.640 --> 02:05:03.840]   Maybe your partner, your friend, your personal assistant.
[02:05:03.840 --> 02:05:06.000]   It's like if you need to grow your business.
[02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:09.040]   ZipRecruiter makes hiring so much easier.
[02:05:09.040 --> 02:05:10.200]   They're kind of like your partner,
[02:05:10.200 --> 02:05:12.040]   your friend, your personal assistant for hiring.
[02:05:12.040 --> 02:05:15.000]   They do the work for you.
[02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:16.280]   And they really do a good job.
[02:05:16.280 --> 02:05:17.800]   And I can say that from personal experience.
[02:05:17.800 --> 02:05:20.840]   Many of our best employees have come to us from ZipRecruiter.
[02:05:20.840 --> 02:05:25.840]   And now you can try it for free at ziprecruiter.com/twit.
[02:05:25.840 --> 02:05:26.840]   When you post on ZipRecruiter,
[02:05:26.840 --> 02:05:29.480]   you're posting to 100 plus job sites
[02:05:29.480 --> 02:05:30.840]   with one click of the mouse.
[02:05:30.840 --> 02:05:33.480]   That's good because it casts the widest net.
[02:05:33.480 --> 02:05:38.520]   And when those applications come roaring in,
[02:05:38.520 --> 02:05:41.200]   it goes straight to, not to your phone or your mailbox,
[02:05:41.200 --> 02:05:43.400]   but it goes straight to the ZipRecruiter interface,
[02:05:43.400 --> 02:05:47.120]   which makes it easy to rank candidates,
[02:05:47.120 --> 02:05:48.720]   reject the people that don't fit
[02:05:48.720 --> 02:05:50.560]   and select the right person fast.
[02:05:50.560 --> 02:05:52.480]   But there's one more thing ZipRecruiter does
[02:05:52.480 --> 02:05:54.120]   that's really the secret sauce.
[02:05:54.120 --> 02:05:57.600]   ZipRecruiter's technology actually finds
[02:05:57.600 --> 02:06:00.120]   the right candidates for your job.
[02:06:00.120 --> 02:06:01.560]   And then tells you about them.
[02:06:01.560 --> 02:06:04.240]   You can invite your top choices to apply.
[02:06:04.240 --> 02:06:05.360]   It's really clever.
[02:06:05.360 --> 02:06:08.320]   They go out through all the existing resumes they have
[02:06:08.320 --> 02:06:10.320]   and they say, "This person be right for your job.
[02:06:10.320 --> 02:06:11.480]   "This person, this person.
[02:06:11.480 --> 02:06:13.280]   "Now they don't tell that person.
[02:06:13.280 --> 02:06:15.600]   "They tell you and you get to invite them."
[02:06:15.600 --> 02:06:17.240]   Something happens, it's kind of magical.
[02:06:17.240 --> 02:06:19.360]   When you invite people to apply for your job,
[02:06:19.360 --> 02:06:20.920]   they're so flattered.
[02:06:20.920 --> 02:06:22.560]   They respond immediately.
[02:06:22.560 --> 02:06:23.760]   They do the interviews.
[02:06:23.760 --> 02:06:26.600]   It's a really great way to reach out.
[02:06:26.600 --> 02:06:28.800]   No wonder four out of five employers
[02:06:28.800 --> 02:06:30.880]   who post on ZipRecruiter get a quality candidate
[02:06:30.880 --> 02:06:32.520]   within the first day.
[02:06:32.520 --> 02:06:34.040]   That's probably why ZipRecruiter's rated
[02:06:34.040 --> 02:06:35.760]   the number one hiring site
[02:06:35.760 --> 02:06:39.880]   based on G2 ratings as of the beginning of this year.
[02:06:39.880 --> 02:06:41.280]   The hardest thing you have to do,
[02:06:41.280 --> 02:06:42.920]   just remember our special URL
[02:06:42.920 --> 02:06:44.880]   to try ZipRecruiter for free,
[02:06:44.880 --> 02:06:48.680]   ziprecruiter.com/twit.
[02:06:48.680 --> 02:06:53.680]   Again, ziprecruiter.com/twit.
[02:06:53.680 --> 02:06:57.160]   The best way to hire ZipRecruiter.
[02:06:57.160 --> 02:06:59.240]   We had a fun week this week on Twitch.
[02:06:59.240 --> 02:07:01.040]   I think we've made a little mini movie
[02:07:01.040 --> 02:07:02.440]   you can watch right here.
[02:07:02.440 --> 02:07:04.240]   See how it went.
[02:07:04.240 --> 02:07:08.080]   - I will say, if someone asks, what's the weirdest tech?
[02:07:08.080 --> 02:07:08.920]   Okay.
[02:07:08.920 --> 02:07:10.320]   - Yeah, I was gonna ask you that.
[02:07:10.320 --> 02:07:11.440]   What was your weirdest?
[02:07:11.440 --> 02:07:14.080]   But somebody already has it here in our Discord.
[02:07:14.080 --> 02:07:17.360]   - C-E-S this year.
[02:07:18.360 --> 02:07:19.720]   - Chained tech.
[02:07:19.720 --> 02:07:20.560]   - What?
[02:07:20.560 --> 02:07:22.520]   - Chained tech.
[02:07:22.520 --> 02:07:23.720]   I did not mispronounce that.
[02:07:23.720 --> 02:07:24.720]   (laughing)
[02:07:24.720 --> 02:07:25.560]   - Chained tech.
[02:07:25.560 --> 02:07:26.400]   - I don't even want to go to tech.
[02:07:26.400 --> 02:07:27.400]   - I don't want to go to tech.
[02:07:27.400 --> 02:07:28.240]   - I don't want to go.
[02:07:28.240 --> 02:07:30.240]   (laughing)
[02:07:30.240 --> 02:07:32.280]   - Previously on Twitch.
[02:07:32.280 --> 02:07:34.800]   Twitch news.
[02:07:34.800 --> 02:07:35.960]   - So there is a glasses.
[02:07:35.960 --> 02:07:37.680]   - You should be seeing what I'm saying.
[02:07:37.680 --> 02:07:38.520]   - Oh my gosh.
[02:07:38.520 --> 02:07:40.440]   - Just transcribed for you in real time.
[02:07:40.440 --> 02:07:41.280]   - Oh ho ho.
[02:07:41.280 --> 02:07:42.720]   - Kind of like subtitles for the world.
[02:07:42.720 --> 02:07:43.880]   - Heads up display.
[02:07:43.880 --> 02:07:46.360]   - That would be an amazing travel companion, right?
[02:07:46.360 --> 02:07:47.600]   Like any type of ghost of words.
[02:07:47.600 --> 02:07:48.440]   - That's right.
[02:07:48.440 --> 02:07:49.560]   - You could you put these glasses on
[02:07:49.560 --> 02:07:50.760]   'cause I'd like to talk to you.
[02:07:50.760 --> 02:07:51.600]   (laughing)
[02:07:51.600 --> 02:07:52.440]   - All right.
[02:07:52.440 --> 02:07:53.800]   - Floss Weekly.
[02:07:53.800 --> 02:07:55.520]   - So Hector Martinez is the guest
[02:07:55.520 --> 02:07:58.560]   and he is the lead developer behind something called
[02:07:58.560 --> 02:08:01.800]   Asahi Linux, which is porting Linux
[02:08:01.800 --> 02:08:05.400]   to the new Apple M1 chip,
[02:08:05.400 --> 02:08:08.480]   which is just a mind boggling achievement
[02:08:08.480 --> 02:08:10.480]   that they've been able to make so much progress
[02:08:10.480 --> 02:08:12.760]   so quickly this week in Google.
[02:08:12.760 --> 02:08:15.240]   - The Texas Appeals Court Fifth District
[02:08:15.240 --> 02:08:18.240]   has ruled that the Texas social media law
[02:08:18.240 --> 02:08:20.520]   can proceed a lower court had blocked it.
[02:08:20.520 --> 02:08:23.480]   - If I were running a social media company right now,
[02:08:23.480 --> 02:08:26.520]   I would be talking to my lawyers this very second,
[02:08:26.520 --> 02:08:29.000]   trying to figure out if we can still do business in Texas.
[02:08:29.000 --> 02:08:33.000]   - Twit, join the chat room and watch us watching you.
[02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:36.440]   - That, by the way, that interview with Father Robert
[02:08:36.440 --> 02:08:39.800]   was on club twit and it will be on the club twit plus feed.
[02:08:39.800 --> 02:08:41.520]   If you're not a club twit member,
[02:08:41.520 --> 02:08:42.800]   I wanna encourage you to join it.
[02:08:42.800 --> 02:08:44.000]   It's only seven bucks a month.
[02:08:44.000 --> 02:08:46.120]   You get ad-free versions of all the shows.
[02:08:46.120 --> 02:08:48.960]   You won't even see this ad in your feed.
[02:08:48.960 --> 02:08:52.140]   You also get access to the Discord, which is lots of fun.
[02:08:52.140 --> 02:08:55.280]   Not only discussions about the ongoing shows
[02:08:55.280 --> 02:08:56.760]   like right now this week in tech,
[02:08:56.760 --> 02:08:59.800]   but about all kinds of nerdy topics from comic books
[02:08:59.800 --> 02:09:05.040]   to coding, to cooking, to ham radio,
[02:09:05.040 --> 02:09:07.800]   software science space.
[02:09:07.800 --> 02:09:12.000]   And then we also use the Twit Club to launch new shows.
[02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:13.960]   That's where we launch this week in space.
[02:09:13.960 --> 02:09:16.440]   We've got the Untitled Linux Show, the Gizfiz,
[02:09:16.440 --> 02:09:20.760]   Stacey's Book Club and all those show up on the Twit Plus feed,
[02:09:20.760 --> 02:09:23.240]   which also has content that didn't make it to the podcast,
[02:09:23.240 --> 02:09:25.480]   usually stuff before and after shows, things like that.
[02:09:25.480 --> 02:09:26.680]   So there's a lot of good there.
[02:09:26.680 --> 02:09:30.000]   Twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:34.480]   I invite you to join it really helps us do new things,
[02:09:34.480 --> 02:09:38.040]   do exciting things and we love to have US club members.
[02:09:38.040 --> 02:09:41.680]   Twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:44.040]   Let's see.
[02:09:44.040 --> 02:09:50.080]   From new scientist, virtual reality mask adds realism
[02:09:50.080 --> 02:09:52.920]   by making it harder to breeze.
[02:09:52.920 --> 02:09:55.360]   You know, if they wanted to make virtual reality
[02:09:55.360 --> 02:09:56.760]   even less appealing,
[02:09:56.760 --> 02:10:02.800]   it would be to make it harder to breathe.
[02:10:02.800 --> 02:10:04.480]   They're doing it on purpose.
[02:10:04.480 --> 02:10:09.080]   I don't know why.
[02:10:09.080 --> 02:10:11.840]   It just seems like a, it just seems like,
[02:10:11.840 --> 02:10:14.560]   they've broken you Leo, Leo, they broke you.
[02:10:14.560 --> 02:10:15.400]   They broke me.
[02:10:15.400 --> 02:10:18.640]   It's like, what, why would you do that?
[02:10:18.640 --> 02:10:20.720]   A mask that controls how much air you can breathe
[02:10:20.720 --> 02:10:23.840]   could be used to simulate environments
[02:10:23.840 --> 02:10:25.800]   with a restricted air supply.
[02:10:25.800 --> 02:10:28.680]   Don't wanna go there.
[02:10:28.680 --> 02:10:30.440]   Don't wanna, don't wanna experience that.
[02:10:30.440 --> 02:10:31.560]   Thank you very much.
[02:10:31.560 --> 02:10:35.040]   Baffles me.
[02:10:35.040 --> 02:10:37.200]   Is that an escape room without any of this room?
[02:10:37.200 --> 02:10:38.040]   Yeah, you can.
[02:10:38.040 --> 02:10:38.880]   I don't know what that is.
[02:10:38.880 --> 02:10:40.120]   I mean, this sounds horrible.
[02:10:40.120 --> 02:10:42.320]   Yeah, where do you go that it's harder to breathe?
[02:10:42.320 --> 02:10:43.160]   Space.
[02:10:43.160 --> 02:10:44.000]   Like, what are you gonna simulate?
[02:10:44.000 --> 02:10:44.840]   Yeah.
[02:10:44.840 --> 02:10:45.680]   Space.
[02:10:45.680 --> 02:10:47.400]   Like, oh, you fell out of the ship.
[02:10:47.400 --> 02:10:48.480]   Are you okay?
[02:10:48.480 --> 02:10:50.320]   Close room.
[02:10:50.320 --> 02:10:55.920]   Here's a picture of the black hole
[02:10:55.920 --> 02:10:58.320]   at the center of the galaxy.
[02:10:58.320 --> 02:11:00.040]   This is so cool.
[02:11:00.040 --> 02:11:02.240]   This is a lot of computing power,
[02:11:02.240 --> 02:11:05.680]   millions of years of computing power.
[02:11:05.680 --> 02:11:07.440]   Because the way they got this picture,
[02:11:07.440 --> 02:11:10.000]   Rod Pa was talking about this on the tech guy
[02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.520]   today, is they used hundreds of telescopes
[02:11:12.520 --> 02:11:17.000]   all over the globe to do some sort of weird
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:18.800]   triangulation of this thing.
[02:11:18.800 --> 02:11:23.240]   And it took a huge amount of computing power.
[02:11:23.240 --> 02:11:27.360]   300 researchers, 80 institutions turned a network
[02:11:27.360 --> 02:11:30.640]   of telescopes into essentially a planet-sized
[02:11:30.640 --> 02:11:34.720]   observatory called the Event Horizon Telescope.
[02:11:34.720 --> 02:11:38.840]   Like mind-boggling.
[02:11:38.840 --> 02:11:40.840]   This is a great bit of technology.
[02:11:40.840 --> 02:11:43.240]   Back with the Voyager missions,
[02:11:43.240 --> 02:11:46.640]   the Deep Space network used for communications
[02:11:46.640 --> 02:11:49.640]   with probes and blenders and so forth,
[02:11:49.640 --> 02:11:50.800]   through relays.
[02:11:50.800 --> 02:11:55.040]   There's a principle that the area of a transmitter,
[02:11:55.040 --> 02:11:58.160]   and the same thing would be true with a telescope,
[02:11:58.160 --> 02:12:03.040]   if you combine multiple transmitters at the same time,
[02:12:03.040 --> 02:12:05.240]   it's effectively like having a bigger transmitter,
[02:12:05.240 --> 02:12:07.040]   but you need the technology to unify them
[02:12:07.040 --> 02:12:08.440]   and use them simultaneously.
[02:12:08.440 --> 02:12:10.520]   So you could get much pain or signals,
[02:12:10.520 --> 02:12:12.520]   that's why they were able to get pictures back
[02:12:12.520 --> 02:12:15.640]   from Neptune and Uranus with Voyager 2,
[02:12:15.640 --> 02:12:17.320]   I think was the one that swung by there.
[02:12:17.320 --> 02:12:18.960]   This is a similar principle, it's just like,
[02:12:18.960 --> 02:12:21.000]   you know, well, if you have a bunch of telescopes,
[02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:23.440]   you can combine them and have a super telescope,
[02:12:23.440 --> 02:12:25.520]   because if they're all pointing in the right way,
[02:12:25.520 --> 02:12:28.520]   and you have that vast amount of power behind it.
[02:12:28.520 --> 02:12:33.720]   3.5 petabytes of data from the telescopes.
[02:12:33.720 --> 02:12:35.400]   Now, for some reason, the Smithsonian decided
[02:12:35.400 --> 02:12:37.360]   the best way to communicate how much data that is,
[02:12:37.360 --> 02:12:41.000]   is to say that's the equivalent of 100 million TikTok videos,
[02:12:41.000 --> 02:12:41.840]   which doesn't...
[02:12:41.840 --> 02:12:43.280]   (laughing)
[02:12:43.280 --> 02:12:44.640]   You know, I don't even...
[02:12:44.640 --> 02:12:46.080]   - The only way we understand the world,
[02:12:46.080 --> 02:12:46.920]   you say is that...
[02:12:46.920 --> 02:12:49.080]   - How many TikTok videos would that be?
[02:12:49.080 --> 02:12:51.000]   Well, it was about 100 million.
[02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:52.760]   Because there was so much data,
[02:12:52.760 --> 02:12:54.600]   they could not transmit it via the internet,
[02:12:54.600 --> 02:12:55.760]   it just wasn't fast enough,
[02:12:55.760 --> 02:12:57.560]   they shipped hard drives around.
[02:12:57.560 --> 02:13:00.040]   - Sure. - Yeah, sneaker net.
[02:13:00.040 --> 02:13:03.480]   But it worked, it worked, we now have a picture.
[02:13:03.480 --> 02:13:05.880]   - Maybe quantities of TikTok videos
[02:13:05.880 --> 02:13:08.680]   could be the basis for some sort of fiat currency.
[02:13:08.680 --> 02:13:10.000]   (laughing)
[02:13:10.000 --> 02:13:12.760]   - Well, that's 100 million TikTok videos.
[02:13:12.760 --> 02:13:15.280]   - Okay.
[02:13:15.280 --> 02:13:19.080]   Let's see, anything else?
[02:13:19.080 --> 02:13:22.880]   TikTok is now, by the way,
[02:13:22.880 --> 02:13:26.440]   more people watch TikTok than watch YouTube in the US.
[02:13:26.440 --> 02:13:29.240]   Time spent scrolling through TikTok.
[02:13:29.240 --> 02:13:34.600]   38.6 minutes on TikTok,
[02:13:34.600 --> 02:13:37.040]   on average in 2020,
[02:13:37.040 --> 02:13:40.600]   four minutes more than Facebook's 34 minutes of what?
[02:13:40.600 --> 02:13:41.960]   Minutes per day?
[02:13:41.960 --> 02:13:43.680]   I guess it must be minutes per day.
[02:13:43.680 --> 02:13:48.280]   Time spent with Facebook decreasing TikTok
[02:13:48.280 --> 02:13:50.440]   coming close to YouTube.
[02:13:50.440 --> 02:13:53.680]   Of course, YouTube has created their own short videos
[02:13:53.680 --> 02:13:56.200]   trying to compete with TikTok.
[02:13:56.200 --> 02:13:58.760]   40% of Gen Z spends more than,
[02:13:58.760 --> 02:14:00.800]   this is a disappointing stat.
[02:14:00.800 --> 02:14:04.440]   40% of Gen Z spends more than three hours a day.
[02:14:05.160 --> 02:14:08.000]   On TikTok, that's more than 100 million videos a day.
[02:14:08.000 --> 02:14:08.840]   No, it's not.
[02:14:08.840 --> 02:14:12.280]   Three hours on TikTok.
[02:14:12.280 --> 02:14:15.120]   - They don't watch TV, though.
[02:14:15.120 --> 02:14:19.320]   - Right, that's their entire thing.
[02:14:19.320 --> 02:14:20.160]   I shouldn't knock it,
[02:14:20.160 --> 02:14:22.720]   'cause my son is a verifiable TikTok star,
[02:14:22.720 --> 02:14:26.520]   much bigger audience than ever, than ever I had.
[02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:28.120]   - You're making me hungry again.
[02:14:28.120 --> 02:14:30.480]   - I know, you've seen his videos, haven't you?
[02:14:30.480 --> 02:14:31.640]   - Oh, they're so good.
[02:14:31.640 --> 02:14:32.480]   - Yeah.
[02:14:34.400 --> 02:14:38.200]   While TikTok's time spent, according to e-marketer,
[02:14:38.200 --> 02:14:41.040]   will top YouTube's this year, the revenues,
[02:14:41.040 --> 02:14:42.960]   the ad revenues won't yet.
[02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:46.960]   That will happen in 2024 when TikTok nets $11 billion
[02:14:46.960 --> 02:14:51.440]   in US ad revenues topping the $10.7 billion
[02:14:51.440 --> 02:14:52.840]   that YouTube has today.
[02:14:52.840 --> 02:14:58.360]   And actually, according to TikTok
[02:14:58.360 --> 02:15:01.000]   is starting to share revenue with creators.
[02:15:01.000 --> 02:15:03.800]   So, salt and hank will be glad to hear that.
[02:15:04.720 --> 02:15:09.400]   Actually, you can make some good money, I think, on TikTok.
[02:15:09.400 --> 02:15:11.000]   But you have to kind of do it on your own
[02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:13.360]   by selling ads for yourself and stuff.
[02:15:13.360 --> 02:15:16.520]   It's the first time TikTok's actually shared their revenue
[02:15:16.520 --> 02:15:18.280]   with TikTokers.
[02:15:18.280 --> 02:15:21.360]   - I think it's interesting how it's such a,
[02:15:21.360 --> 02:15:24.000]   it's all video, but nobody thinks
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:26.880]   that TikTok videos are like YouTube videos, right?
[02:15:26.880 --> 02:15:28.120]   I mean, even-- - No, it's very different.
[02:15:28.120 --> 02:15:29.320]   - No, yeah. - Yeah.
[02:15:29.320 --> 02:15:33.480]   - In fact, my son is trying to do YouTube, it's different.
[02:15:33.480 --> 02:15:36.240]   So, he's got to do longer form, it's very different.
[02:15:36.240 --> 02:15:39.280]   His style just fits TikTok perfectly,
[02:15:39.280 --> 02:15:41.640]   but not so much on YouTube,
[02:15:41.640 --> 02:15:43.800]   although he's growing fast on YouTube.
[02:15:43.800 --> 02:15:48.180]   Would you like to buy the house where Facebook was born?
[02:15:48.180 --> 02:15:51.560]   This is the house that Mark Zuckerberg
[02:15:51.560 --> 02:15:55.920]   and his cohorts moved into 25 years ago
[02:15:55.920 --> 02:15:58.920]   in Silicon Valley and Los Altos, six bedrooms,
[02:15:58.920 --> 02:16:01.440]   four and a half baths, Mark Zuckerberg,
[02:16:01.440 --> 02:16:06.440]   19 Dustin Moskowitz, 19, Sean Parker, 24, lived there.
[02:16:06.440 --> 02:16:10.160]   The owner is looking to sell her newly refurbished home.
[02:16:10.160 --> 02:16:13.560]   How much would you pay for this beautiful home
[02:16:13.560 --> 02:16:14.720]   in Los Altos?
[02:16:14.720 --> 02:16:17.680]   They're asking $5.3 million.
[02:16:17.680 --> 02:16:20.760]   You should be a little plaque.
[02:16:20.760 --> 02:16:22.440]   - I'd say 100 million TikToks for it, of course.
[02:16:22.440 --> 02:16:23.960]   (laughing)
[02:16:23.960 --> 02:16:26.000]   - There should be a little plaque, Mark Zuckerberg,
[02:16:26.000 --> 02:16:28.200]   slept here or something, that'd be kind of cool.
[02:16:28.200 --> 02:16:30.080]   You could put that on there if you buy it.
[02:16:30.080 --> 02:16:30.920]   - Yeah. - Yep.
[02:16:30.920 --> 02:16:33.240]   - It'd be interesting to look at the Zillow comps
[02:16:33.240 --> 02:16:34.080]   for that house.
[02:16:34.080 --> 02:16:35.800]   I mean, it's expensive anyway.
[02:16:35.800 --> 02:16:37.960]   - That's an expensive neighborhood, absolutely.
[02:16:37.960 --> 02:16:41.320]   Yeah, we should check to see if that's a little more,
[02:16:41.320 --> 02:16:43.560]   if there's a premium because it is the place
[02:16:43.560 --> 02:16:44.680]   Facebook was born.
[02:16:44.680 --> 02:16:50.040]   I think we could just say those were our final stories
[02:16:50.040 --> 02:16:50.880]   for the week.
[02:16:50.880 --> 02:16:53.640]   You guys have been very fun and wonderful.
[02:16:53.640 --> 02:16:57.080]   Caitlin, I hope you enjoyed your first visit
[02:16:57.080 --> 02:16:57.960]   to this week in Tech,
[02:16:57.960 --> 02:16:59.800]   and I hope you'll come back many more times.
[02:16:59.800 --> 02:17:01.280]   Great to have you.
[02:17:01.280 --> 02:17:02.120]   - Thank you for having me.
[02:17:02.120 --> 02:17:02.960]   This was great.
[02:17:02.960 --> 02:17:05.880]   - Caitlin McGarry, News Editor of Protocol,
[02:17:05.880 --> 02:17:08.080]   the source code podcast.
[02:17:08.080 --> 02:17:09.880]   You do that weekly?
[02:17:09.880 --> 02:17:11.320]   - Yes, weekly.
[02:17:11.320 --> 02:17:13.880]   - And is it always about crypto
[02:17:13.880 --> 02:17:15.880]   or is it a variety of topics?
[02:17:15.880 --> 02:17:19.680]   - No, it's about the week's biggest tech news.
[02:17:19.680 --> 02:17:22.520]   We're usually highlighting our really great
[02:17:22.520 --> 02:17:24.320]   original reporting at Protocol,
[02:17:24.320 --> 02:17:27.480]   so we have our excellent colleagues join us,
[02:17:28.440 --> 02:17:31.720]   and hopefully some special guests from outside
[02:17:31.720 --> 02:17:33.320]   of Protocol as well soon.
[02:17:33.320 --> 02:17:35.240]   - Is Elon Musk serious?
[02:17:35.240 --> 02:17:37.480]   (laughing)
[02:17:37.480 --> 02:17:40.160]   Yeah, there you go.
[02:17:40.160 --> 02:17:41.840]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:17:41.840 --> 02:17:45.760]   Good, I'll have to add that to my subscriptions,
[02:17:45.760 --> 02:17:48.640]   source code podcast at protocol.com.
[02:17:48.640 --> 02:17:50.200]   A pleasure meeting you,
[02:17:50.200 --> 02:17:52.400]   and thanks for joining us on the show.
[02:17:52.400 --> 02:17:54.080]   I'm glad you knew Glenn.
[02:17:54.080 --> 02:17:55.320]   I think that's nice.
[02:17:55.320 --> 02:17:56.680]   It's a small world, I guess.
[02:17:56.680 --> 02:17:58.400]   - Yeah, it is a small world, I guess.
[02:17:58.400 --> 02:18:00.320]   - Glenn, it was so good to see you.
[02:18:00.320 --> 02:18:01.160]   (laughing)
[02:18:01.160 --> 02:18:02.200]   - Likewise, this is so exciting.
[02:18:02.200 --> 02:18:03.760]   I was so happy to see your name on the--
[02:18:03.760 --> 02:18:04.960]   - Glenn Fleischman list.
[02:18:04.960 --> 02:18:09.040]   Glenn.fund, show us what you just bought.
[02:18:09.040 --> 02:18:10.040]   - Okay, let's see here.
[02:18:10.040 --> 02:18:13.760]   So this is a flong, FL-O-N-G.
[02:18:13.760 --> 02:18:16.520]   - I learned about flongs a couple of weeks ago.
[02:18:16.520 --> 02:18:18.320]   - Printing history.
[02:18:18.320 --> 02:18:19.160]   - Oh wow.
[02:18:19.160 --> 02:18:21.400]   - So that's made out of like a paper mache-like material
[02:18:21.400 --> 02:18:26.400]   that then put the lead into to make a page.
[02:18:26.400 --> 02:18:27.920]   - Exactly.
[02:18:27.920 --> 02:18:31.640]   - So here's what's called a stereotype.
[02:18:31.640 --> 02:18:32.640]   This is what it looks like.
[02:18:32.640 --> 02:18:33.880]   It says two, oh upside down.
[02:18:33.880 --> 02:18:35.400]   It's great doing great with video.
[02:18:35.400 --> 02:18:37.640]   - That's a comic book.
[02:18:37.640 --> 02:18:38.480]   - Comic page.
[02:18:38.480 --> 02:18:40.320]   - Yeah, so this would have been made from a flong
[02:18:40.320 --> 02:18:43.120]   and then used for later parts of the printing process.
[02:18:43.120 --> 02:18:44.760]   - Oh, John says it's doing-- - It's doing it is.
[02:18:44.760 --> 02:18:47.080]   - Oh, that's a cool thing to have.
[02:18:47.080 --> 02:18:48.360]   - And so somebody saved this
[02:18:48.360 --> 02:18:49.760]   because these were all melted down.
[02:18:49.760 --> 02:18:51.280]   The same thing, the flongs were made of paper,
[02:18:51.280 --> 02:18:53.600]   you know, paper wood pulp, they were burned.
[02:18:53.600 --> 02:18:55.400]   The paper mache, I mean, sorry,
[02:18:55.400 --> 02:18:57.720]   the metal would have been re-melted and used.
[02:18:57.720 --> 02:19:01.000]   Newspapers used thousands of pounds of lead alloy
[02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:03.080]   every night and then melted it down
[02:19:03.080 --> 02:19:04.680]   and used it for the next edition.
[02:19:04.680 --> 02:19:07.920]   And newspapers could go through 10 editions in a day.
[02:19:07.920 --> 02:19:09.520]   You know, they'd revise the news.
[02:19:09.520 --> 02:19:10.800]   It was like the web or something.
[02:19:10.800 --> 02:19:12.000]   They would just keep melting lead,
[02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:14.120]   but it was the web with lead.
[02:19:14.120 --> 02:19:17.040]   - So shows again, this one is John Glenn,
[02:19:17.040 --> 02:19:19.840]   his first-- - Oh, upside down.
[02:19:19.840 --> 02:19:21.480]   - Yeah, yeah, this is-- - Lane goes,
[02:19:21.480 --> 02:19:23.920]   launch is okay, report on an orbit, awaited.
[02:19:23.920 --> 02:19:26.720]   This is a news day front page.
[02:19:26.720 --> 02:19:29.120]   - Oh, I've got a little bit of an action.
[02:19:29.120 --> 02:19:30.040]   - Yeah, you can kind of see--
[02:19:30.040 --> 02:19:32.840]   - How would the Lane do the halftone?
[02:19:32.840 --> 02:19:35.960]   - It's amazing how high resolution this is.
[02:19:35.960 --> 02:19:37.920]   You can feel it, it's in relief.
[02:19:37.920 --> 02:19:40.920]   And so it actually literally, they would cast it,
[02:19:40.920 --> 02:19:43.280]   they would cast a halftone from it that was printed.
[02:19:43.280 --> 02:19:45.640]   This is how essentially all newspapers were printed
[02:19:45.640 --> 02:19:47.960]   was with this, there was a flong before this,
[02:19:47.960 --> 02:19:51.280]   but this hard paper flong was used from about 1900
[02:19:51.280 --> 02:19:52.520]   to the 1980s.
[02:19:52.520 --> 02:19:55.360]   And it's a whole other thing.
[02:19:55.360 --> 02:19:56.360]   I'll show you one more thing
[02:19:56.360 --> 02:19:57.840]   because this is a prized possession.
[02:19:57.840 --> 02:20:00.480]   I've got more coming though, is it's a peanut spong.
[02:20:00.480 --> 02:20:01.320]   - Oh, look at that.
[02:20:01.320 --> 02:20:04.120]   - Four color strip from the 1970s.
[02:20:04.120 --> 02:20:08.120]   And Lucy, Dr. Lucy, and then this is the printed--
[02:20:08.120 --> 02:20:10.320]   - So is that one-- - Is that just the black color?
[02:20:10.320 --> 02:20:11.160]   I mean, you'd have to have one for each color.
[02:20:11.160 --> 02:20:12.360]   - This is just the black.
[02:20:12.360 --> 02:20:14.200]   I have all the colors, and then here's the,
[02:20:14.200 --> 02:20:17.240]   I found the eBay, this is the printed version
[02:20:17.240 --> 02:20:20.760]   from a San Francisco Chronicle in one of them,
[02:20:20.760 --> 02:20:22.040]   it's 1977.
[02:20:22.040 --> 02:20:23.360]   So this is kind of a late example,
[02:20:23.360 --> 02:20:26.680]   but this is how I while away my non-digital time
[02:20:26.680 --> 02:20:28.960]   is looking at analog things like that.
[02:20:28.960 --> 02:20:31.960]   - Wow, very, very cool.
[02:20:31.960 --> 02:20:35.080]   There's a picture on Twitter of it.
[02:20:35.080 --> 02:20:35.920]   That's just neat.
[02:20:35.920 --> 02:20:37.520]   - And I'm guessing that's where we got
[02:20:37.520 --> 02:20:39.640]   the word stereotype, right?
[02:20:39.640 --> 02:20:42.680]   - Exactly, yeah, and funny, so stereotype comes from that
[02:20:42.680 --> 02:20:44.520]   'cause you're making a copy of something,
[02:20:44.520 --> 02:20:47.560]   and cliche is the French word for stereotype,
[02:20:47.560 --> 02:20:50.880]   which is funny, and then typecasting is from casting type.
[02:20:50.880 --> 02:20:53.000]   Somebody was, you know, you're casting type,
[02:20:53.000 --> 02:20:55.040]   and so you got three different words
[02:20:55.040 --> 02:20:57.800]   that all came into English, but cliche is good.
[02:20:57.800 --> 02:21:00.000]   Apparently the sound when the plates were being printed
[02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:01.800]   was cliche, cliche, cliche, cliche.
[02:21:01.800 --> 02:21:04.800]   - No, that's what they claim.
[02:21:04.800 --> 02:21:07.520]   - That's what they claim, I don't know if it's true,
[02:21:07.520 --> 02:21:09.160]   but it's all from that.
[02:21:09.160 --> 02:21:10.520]   - That is a story.
[02:21:10.520 --> 02:21:12.000]   Here's another one you bought.
[02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:16.240]   Reds put radio-filled Sputnik in orbit.
[02:21:16.240 --> 02:21:17.680]   - Yeah, nice.
[02:21:17.680 --> 02:21:19.720]   - This is what I love is, so that was the most important
[02:21:19.720 --> 02:21:21.400]   news of the day, but the big pictures on it
[02:21:21.400 --> 02:21:24.520]   are with some kind of blind date competition.
[02:21:24.520 --> 02:21:25.400]   (laughing)
[02:21:25.400 --> 02:21:27.800]   Honestly, they're set for blind, I'm not even thinking.
[02:21:27.800 --> 02:21:30.480]   So it's the Reds go to, you know,
[02:21:30.480 --> 02:21:33.280]   it's what Sputnik, but here's a couple about today.
[02:21:33.280 --> 02:21:34.960]   - Well, hit moot, tests have failed yet,
[02:21:34.960 --> 02:21:37.000]   and then a couple on the cover of Newsday,
[02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:38.360]   this is the most important news of the day.
[02:21:38.360 --> 02:21:39.200]   - It's Long Island for you.
[02:21:39.200 --> 02:21:40.760]   - It's history, it's how you learn this.
[02:21:40.760 --> 02:21:42.600]   - So is there a long marketplace?
[02:21:42.600 --> 02:21:44.640]   Where do you go to find flong?
[02:21:44.640 --> 02:21:47.880]   - Oh, I buy stuff on eBay because nobody cares about flong,
[02:21:47.880 --> 02:21:49.760]   it makes me in a handful of printing historians,
[02:21:49.760 --> 02:21:51.160]   so we have a fun time of it,
[02:21:51.160 --> 02:21:53.800]   but I just, I have the motherload of flong coming
[02:21:53.800 --> 02:21:56.400]   from a guy in Sweden who bought a huge set,
[02:21:56.400 --> 02:21:59.400]   I have almost 200 peanuts flongs from the US
[02:21:59.400 --> 02:22:01.160]   that made their way to Sweden that are coming,
[02:22:01.160 --> 02:22:02.560]   I think they're running tomorrow.
[02:22:02.560 --> 02:22:05.400]   And I'm not a collector because I do not have enough room
[02:22:05.400 --> 02:22:08.640]   to collect stuff, I'm bringing stuff in, taking photos,
[02:22:08.640 --> 02:22:11.000]   documenting it, and then sort of distributing it.
[02:22:11.000 --> 02:22:12.320]   So I'm donning something to museums.
[02:22:12.320 --> 02:22:13.720]   - Oh, nice.
[02:22:13.720 --> 02:22:16.520]   - But in touch with the Schultz Museum about donating
[02:22:16.520 --> 02:22:18.720]   or selling some of the peanuts collection to them.
[02:22:18.720 --> 02:22:20.400]   - When you come out to deliver that,
[02:22:20.400 --> 02:22:22.320]   we're just down the road, you come visit us.
[02:22:22.320 --> 02:22:23.400]   - You are down the road, right?
[02:22:23.400 --> 02:22:24.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:22:24.240 --> 02:22:25.240]   - Yeah, they're in Santa Rosa,
[02:22:25.240 --> 02:22:27.160]   we're just here in Petaluma, short distance.
[02:22:27.160 --> 02:22:29.280]   - I've offered to go down and lecture about flong,
[02:22:29.280 --> 02:22:30.400]   so we'll see if they take me up.
[02:22:30.400 --> 02:22:35.640]   - Okay, maybe we could split the cost with the Santa Rosa
[02:22:35.640 --> 02:22:36.880]   Peanuts Museum.
[02:22:36.880 --> 02:22:38.360]   (laughing)
[02:22:38.360 --> 02:22:39.880]   Thank you, Glenn, great to have you.
[02:22:39.880 --> 02:22:40.720]   - Thank you so much.
[02:22:40.720 --> 02:22:44.200]   - As always, Denise Howell, you're my internet lawyer,
[02:22:44.200 --> 02:22:45.680]   always a thrill to have you on.
[02:22:45.680 --> 02:22:46.920]   What are you up to these days?
[02:22:46.920 --> 02:22:49.240]   Anything exciting to share with us?
[02:22:49.240 --> 02:22:50.200]   - Yeah, I think you're exciting.
[02:22:50.200 --> 02:22:52.200]   Just plugging along, working away,
[02:22:52.200 --> 02:22:55.000]   trying to toil in the vineyards of justice
[02:22:55.000 --> 02:22:56.200]   as best as possible.
[02:22:56.200 --> 02:22:59.080]   - Well, maybe that's where you'd use the virtual reality mask
[02:22:59.080 --> 02:23:00.080]   where you can't breathe.
[02:23:00.080 --> 02:23:03.200]   That's probably, that's probably simulating
[02:23:03.200 --> 02:23:05.560]   the orchards of justice.
[02:23:05.560 --> 02:23:07.560]   Well, I'm glad you're doing so well.
[02:23:07.560 --> 02:23:08.400]   It's great to see you.
[02:23:08.400 --> 02:23:12.280]   Denisehowl.info is the website.
[02:23:12.280 --> 02:23:13.680]   Thank you all for being here.
[02:23:13.680 --> 02:23:14.920]   You guys are great.
[02:23:14.920 --> 02:23:15.760]   We had a lot of fun.
[02:23:15.760 --> 02:23:17.000]   I'm thank you for joining us.
[02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:19.360]   If you wanna watch Twit Live, you can.
[02:23:19.360 --> 02:23:22.960]   We do the show every Sunday about 2 p.m. Pacific, 5 p.m.
[02:23:22.960 --> 02:23:25.600]   Eastern 2100 UTC.
[02:23:25.600 --> 02:23:30.080]   The live stream, audio or video is at live.twit.tv.
[02:23:30.080 --> 02:23:31.880]   People who are watching live chat live,
[02:23:31.880 --> 02:23:34.840]   you can, everybody's invited to join us in the IRC
[02:23:34.840 --> 02:23:36.760]   and IRC.twit.tv.
[02:23:36.760 --> 02:23:39.880]   Club members can also join us in the Discord.
[02:23:39.880 --> 02:23:41.920]   After the fact on demand versions of the show
[02:23:41.920 --> 02:23:44.720]   available at our website, twit.tv,
[02:23:44.720 --> 02:23:48.880]   there's a dedicated YouTube channel for every show we do.
[02:23:48.880 --> 02:23:51.000]   So there's a twit channel on YouTube.
[02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:52.560]   I think it's this week in tech
[02:23:52.560 --> 02:23:54.440]   and you can watch the videos there.
[02:23:54.440 --> 02:23:55.760]   Probably the best way to do it.
[02:23:55.760 --> 02:23:58.360]   Certainly the recommended way to do it
[02:23:58.360 --> 02:24:00.520]   is to subscribe in your favorite podcast player
[02:24:00.520 --> 02:24:01.800]   that way you get it automatically.
[02:24:01.800 --> 02:24:03.320]   You don't have to think about it
[02:24:03.320 --> 02:24:06.160]   and you can watch or listen at your leisure.
[02:24:06.160 --> 02:24:09.680]   And if your podcast player allows for reviews, please,
[02:24:09.680 --> 02:24:10.880]   leave us a five star review.
[02:24:10.880 --> 02:24:13.440]   Let the world know about,
[02:24:13.440 --> 02:24:17.000]   I think the longest running tech podcast in the world
[02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:20.240]   now in our 18th year.
[02:24:20.240 --> 02:24:21.200]   Amazing.
[02:24:21.200 --> 02:24:22.600]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:24:22.600 --> 02:24:24.560]   Another twit is in the camera.
[02:24:24.560 --> 02:24:25.400]   Bye bye.
[02:24:25.400 --> 02:24:27.980]   (upbeat music)
[02:24:27.980 --> 02:24:30.560]   (upbeat music)
[02:24:30.560 --> 02:24:33.140]   (upbeat music)
[02:24:33.140 --> 02:24:35.140]   Do it a twit, baby.
[02:24:35.140 --> 02:24:37.280]   Do as a Twitter.
