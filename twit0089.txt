[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.840]   Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for Twit number 89.
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.880]   It's somewhat delayed but nevertheless just as tasty as it was the day it was produced.
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.800]   Which was today.
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.680]   Joining me on the panel today, we're very happy to welcome a newbie.
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.360]   The wonderful Veronica Belmont, you remember her from Buzz Out Loud?
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.360]   Hello.
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.520]   And World of Warcraft.
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.640]   You say that from a Yacht Este Besta.
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:31.360]   [ Speaking in German ]
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.520]   So that's our World of Warcraft guild that we have with a bunch of different podcasters.
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.320]   You're invited of course.
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.280]   Really? Could I be in it?
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.080]   Of course.
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.200]   It's a podcaster guild?
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.760]   Yeah.
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.440]   Well, Joey Edo won't let me in his guild.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.600]   So I'm joining the die as cast.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.640]   They won't let you in we know?
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.120]   Yeah. Well, are you in we know?
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.000]   I actually do have a tune on that server but I'm not in we know.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.600]   I got through the preliminary, you know, trying to get in and then I never went further than that.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.840]   Somebody even tell me what you're talking about.
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.480]   Yeah, sorry.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.160]   You're just too old, John.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.680]   It's World of Warcraft.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.000]   What?
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.720]   Orts that, you say?
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.400]   And Joey Edo who is a real mover in Shaker is a venture capitalist but very involved in
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.920]   Web 2.0 stuff and blogging and he says it's the new golf.
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.000]   It's where people meet to make deals.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.680]   Yeah, great.
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.160]   So not only can I be excluded from the golfing world, I'm also excluded from the World of Warcraft
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.480]   world.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.480]   Yeah, I'll give you a grand tour.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.880]   It's fine.
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.240]   I know it's just oh no.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.880]   What's your highest level?
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.720]   What do you call them?
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:35.040]   Tune.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.080]   Yeah, to introduce everyone else.
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.960]   We'll talk to that later.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.160]   I'm sorry. I'm too busy talking to Veronica.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, that voice, that cranky voice in the background, you know them.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.560]   You love them.

[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.200]   I thought you were introducing Patrick.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.560]   You need no introduction, John.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.280]   All right, Patrick Norton is also here from the fabulous dl.tv
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.800]   where he labors with Robert Herron and others to create fine television programming for the
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.000]   internet twice a week.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.680]   Yes, tech content, baby.
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.040]   We're going to talk about making you a second.
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:14.080]   And Merlin Mann of 43folders.com and the new, what is it called?
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.800]   Merle Bamelog. Vermaloomerlog.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.360]   What do you call it?
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.400]   We're talking about ding dong.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.240]   I beg your pardon.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.520]   Are you talking about my tumble mama log?
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.600]   Yeah, what's your tumblemama log?
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.360]   Tumble mama log, tumble mama log.
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.640]   It's yeah, it's the new tumble log.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.600]   You got one too, Leo.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.320]   I do.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.360]   Rat hole.tv.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.800]   Down on that, I'm not gonna be good on this one.
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.880]   On the tumblr, tumblr.com, right?
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:35.680]   Tumbler is pretty cool.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.360]   To UMBLR and the true web 2.0 tradition, drop the last bow.
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.880]   And it's a tumble log that you don't have.
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.520]   Well, you know what? I don't even want to get into explaining what a tumble log is.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.520]   So no, I want to know what a tumble log is.
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.560]   I do too.
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.320]   It's pretty cool. Merlin, you want to do the honors?
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.400]   Merlin's efficient, maybe.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.440]   It's all about efficient.
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.880]   Two minutes in, it's already a rat hole.
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.400]   A tumble log is kind of a very lightweight web log.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.960]   It's a way to post a little kind of a femoral content,
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.960]   where it wouldn't be as much as a full blog post.
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.560]   You're not ditching Twitter, are you?
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.120]   No, no, no.
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.240]   For the love of God now.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.680]   It's kind of like Twitter.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.120]   So addicted to Twitter, and I hate myself.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.400]   We got three Twitters here.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.440]   Mumi and Veronica, all are regular Twitter.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.880]   Mm-hmm, rabid, I would say.
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.240]   In fact, I just tried to use Twitter
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.720]   when we were having technical difficulties to contact you.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.960]   Oh, I can't. We actually...
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.200]   Actually, Veronica gets a lot like Twitter.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.480]   It's very kind of a femoral.
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:25.440]   Here's what I'm up to stuff.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.320]   But you could also throw in stuff like song lyrics and photos.
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.720]   And that's a little bit like a combination between like maybe like
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.920]   delicious flicker and Twitter.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.720]   But it's a lot of fun.
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.680]   You want to see a good example?
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.400]   Merlin.tumblr.com.
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.920]   I don't know if it's a good example.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.560]   It's a great example.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.680]   You can see me with a cartoon penguin.
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:42.960]   That's I believe that's my latest.
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.080]   Who is that, by the way?
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.040]   That's Bad Bats Maru.
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.360]   He's a character of the Sanrio Corporation.
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.080]   Oh, look at that.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.880]   So that's the idea.
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:51.680]   There are no comments.
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.400]   It's very stripped down, very basic.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.960]   Hey, wait, wait.
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.800]   Give me that URL again because I didn't get it.
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.640]   Merlin.merelin.tumblr.
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.360]   Oh, blr.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.120]   Okay. I remember no E because that would...
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.080]   Oh, yeah, heaven forbid.
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.120]   That would be web 1.0.
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.080]   Yeah.
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.840]   You only get vowels after your second round.
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.200]   Or go to rathole.tv.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:10.800]   Mine is not as good an example.
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.200]   It's like a blog to me.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.760]   You know what I want?
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:15.040]   Like a blog with comments off.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.240]   That's right.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.840]   You only get a bag.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.480]   No, it also has it's all centered in the typefaces.
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.040]   Really huge.
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.200]   So it looks more like a blog with the comments off,
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.880]   done by an insane person.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:25.760]   You know the way they get.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.760]   Insane person center everything.
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:28.400]   That's right.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.280]   That's just insane.
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.440]   Cool.
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:29.920]   I'm good.
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.040]   That's pretty good.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.240]   That was pretty good.
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.360]   No, it's a...
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.440]   I don't know if I'm going to pick up on this one.
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.000]   Bad thing.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.160]   But we've been talking about two in one of these for
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.760]   a MacPrick weekly where people can contribute to it.
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:40.800]   I want to do a Twitch one.
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.440]   And I'm going to create...
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.400]   I am...
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.880]   I'm...
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:43.920]   This kind of convinced me.
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.160]   I'm going to actually create a Twitch one for anybody.
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.440]   You, John, Patrick, anybody who's wants Merlin,
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.480]   wants to do that.
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.320]   What you do is you just throw crap up there.
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.760]   I mean, the idea is you don't think about it.
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.880]   You don't write it.
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.480]   And that's different than a regular blog.
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.720]   But do we really need more stuff like this?
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.520]   I mean, seriously.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.960]   How many more mini blogs and blogs and vox accounts and all that jazz we have?
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.280]   I thought the most blog with the venture capital.
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:07.920]   I am...
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.120]   The most blog was the worst.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.880]   I'm having feature fatigue.
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.360]   The reason I'm 2.0 feature fatigue.
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.960]   I think the thing is you don't need all of these.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.360]   But the reason, I think the person that a tumble log for
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.160]   is someone who doesn't want to have to sit around and take a photo of their cat
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.520]   or write some kind of a very long post about how they feel about politics.
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.520]   It's going to have to do that with a regular blog.
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.160]   No, you don't.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:26.880]   You can do the same thing.
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:27.600]   You don't have to...
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.040]   I agree with John.
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.080]   Yeah, you could use WordPress.
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.920]   You could use anything to do a tumble log.
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.360]   I think it's for the guy who already...
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.040]   or gal who already has a blog.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:41.200]   But it has other stuff that they don't want to form into coherent C.
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.320]   So they just put this...
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.520]   Coherency is overrated.
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.720]   Yeah, I was going to say...
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.640]   I see a lot of incoherent.
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.320]   I see what you're saying, Leo.
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.400]   Even though I know, I realize that you're a joiner.
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.000]   So anything that comes up that's new.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.120]   I don't want everything.
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:53.600]   But...
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:54.720]   I do too.
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:56.320]   That's just back off a second.
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:02.640]   What you're saying is that this allows you to have another blog with a different consistency.
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:02.800]   Right.
[00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.400]   So you like the one thing to be...
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.280]   So it has more of a whipped frothy light consistency.
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.960]   Whatever.
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.960]   Yeah, or the centered insane...
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.400]   You know what kind of an insane...
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.040]   Well, how is centering insane?
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:16.720]   Well, take a look at a new here.
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.200]   Here's...
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:17.600]   Find...
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.880]   Go find any...
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:23.440]   Go find one of those guys who think there's a lot of flying saucers or the government's doing weird stuff.
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.280]   And go find their website.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.240]   They're usually not blogs, but they're just these really weird websites.
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.560]   And the mark of insanity is always the same.
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.520]   They used the biggest...
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.640]   No, the mark of insanity is when you align everything centered.
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.280]   No, mark of insanity is comic sans.
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.560]   No, immediately.
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.680]   Band comics sans.
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.280]   Let's get an end.
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.400]   I guess, well, anyway.
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.480]   The idea is everything is aligned centered.
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.600]   That's exactly right.
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:49.040]   It's usually stuff like red type on a black background.
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:52.160]   The biggest type font that they can find.
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:53.520]   And it goes all the way down.
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.600]   It goes for miles down to China someplace before you can even have a pink super pink.
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.360]   Or a tiled image as the background.
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.240]   And there's a lot of moving...
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:03.040]   Jiffs.
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:03.760]   The dog running...
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:04.640]   And blink tags.
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:05.680]   Blink tags.
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.320]   Blink tags.
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.400]   The dogs running back and forth.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:09.200]   The...
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.200]   We have to invent this website now.
[00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.800]   I think it's my homepage, but I'm...
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:13.600]   Yeah, it's not safe.
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.640]   Like geostinies.
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.640]   The mailboxes opening and closing.
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:18.400]   There's always a couple of dancing girls.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.440]   Let's talk about urinal cakes,
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.280]   because I don't think it can go down from here.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:26.000]   Now I'm saving urinal cakes.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.600]   You brought it up with Tumblog.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.240]   I did.
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.800]   I just think it's kind of cool, but you don't have to participate.
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:31.280]   It is cool.
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.360]   And I think it's the best thing ever.
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:37.440]   Okay, show of hands.
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.360]   How many of you have used juiced?
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.080]   Me.
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:40.880]   Me.
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:41.440]   I have.
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.000]   Oh, we have.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:42.640]   I have.
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:43.760]   That was a verbal hand raising.
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:44.160]   That's everywhere.
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:45.040]   I'm on the waiting list.
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:45.440]   I'm on the...
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.440]   No, no, I'm waitlisted, but I'm looking forward to getting it.
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:48.720]   It's hard to get it in the waiting list.
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:49.840]   I only got two invites.
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.520]   I wrote a blog post.
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:52.720]   I think it stinks.
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:53.840]   You don't like it.
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.560]   No, go to devork.org and type in juiced.
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.480]   Let me give you the news story, the big news.
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.800]   But John, it's a shame you don't like it.
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.320]   That's it.
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:02.880]   It's all over.
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.160]   Forget it.
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.680]   What don't you think about it?
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.320]   I think it's dumb in a lot of different ways.
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.680]   I think the content stinks.
[00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:10.880]   Well, they just started with Viacom.
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:11.840]   I think they're full of crap.
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:12.240]   They did.
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.600]   Viacom is a big fuck one.
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:14.080]   Yeah, right.
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.320]   Viacom is going to put the worst stuff on your than I can put.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.600]   This is what's going to be on the Utah.
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.920]   Real world.
[00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:20.960]   Laguna Beach.
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.000]   Beavis and butthead and flavor of love.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.280]   Those will do really well.
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.640]   I think also my sweet 16.
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.080]   If I'm remembering.
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:33.280]   Viacom Bonet heads take off the comedy central stuff and the
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:36.000]   Colbert stuff off at YouTube and all the other stuff,
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.360]   which was nothing for them, but free publicity since YouTube
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.040]   wasn't making any money off that stuff.
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.200]   And it didn't cost them anything to post it.
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:45.040]   So this is like smart.
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:49.200]   So they go to a juice because juice tells everybody the thing is piracy proof.
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.200]   Now that made me laugh out loud.
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.920]   Well, let me give you the chronology here.
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:58.160]   A week ago, Viacom gives 100,000 a takedown,
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:03.440]   DMC a takedown to YouTube for 100,000 videos from VH1 MTV
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.640]   and comedy center, probably mostly from comedy center.
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.320]   They're all gone off of YouTube.
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.040]   There's a big announcement.
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:10.960]   You can't, you know, you can't see this.
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.960]   Sorry, Viacom has pulled this down.
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:17.040]   The following week they announced a deal with juiced.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:18.000]   Juiced is going to carry it.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.160]   Now, juice is a creation of the folks who did Skype, who did Kazah.
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:24.720]   Ironically, Kazah, which was a piracy tool.
[00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.320]   They've decided they've reformed.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:29.440]   Yeah, piracy tool that puts spyware on your system.
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.040]   This is really something to be proud of.
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.600]   They know what they're doing though.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.280]   You can't deny Skype is a great.
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.280]   Yeah, no, they know what they're doing with Skype.
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.400]   This is not Skype.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:40.960]   They do one thing that doesn't mean everything they do is gold.
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.320]   You know, I think it looks really good.
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.520]   I think it works really well.
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:46.480]   I think it's just going to be some time before the content catches up with it.
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:48.960]   This is the IPTV thing that you were talking about, John.
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.000]   It's not an IPTV.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.040]   It doesn't go to the TV.
[00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.800]   Well, John, first of all, Veronica is right.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.560]   Second of all, it's in the early stages.
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:58.400]   They're just developing content relationships.
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:04.640]   Third of all, having had closer conversations with them than John or Leo, I think either of you have had.
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:08.320]   The quality of the content is going to consistently go up.
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:14.320]   In terms of the video delivery, because their minimum specs for submitting video
[00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.480]   is 6 megabit per second at MPEG-2.
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:21.760]   They're basically setting it up to do high-end distribution on the content.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.920]   When it gets there, I'll be praising it to nonstop.
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:29.760]   But I don't get why everybody's praising it now when it's not there yet.
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.680]   But oh, what they're going to do this, they're going to do that.
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:32.320]   Well, fine.
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.920]   I think you can see where they're going.
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.360]   I hate to use the beta excuse.
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:40.240]   Everybody in the Silicon Valley, they always have these huge grandiose schemes.
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.760]   The thing goes bogged down.
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:42.560]   It'll blow up.
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.240]   There's a million things that can go wrong.
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:44.800]   Sure.
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.480]   These roadmaps are fantastic.
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:48.720]   Hey, show me the proof of the pudding.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.680]   I don't fall in line lockstep just because Intel's
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:52.880]   going to do something.
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.000]   And nobody's asking.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.280]   John, nobody's asking you.
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:00.400]   You and everybody else, Patrick, are already singing praises for this thing.
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.160]   Let me ask Patrick a little bit more about this.
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.640]   To get to that 6 megabits, is it going to be a use peer-to-peer?
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:07.600]   I mean, that's their answer.
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.200]   They're not going to know.
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.000]   Hold on.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.040]   Let me actually turn on more of my usual curmudgeonly nature,
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.960]   so John doesn't think I'm a complete stool.
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.560]   I've obviously terribly disappointed John.
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.240]   But I mean, everything.
[00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:24.720]   And you know what?
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.400]   90% of the time he's absolutely right.
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.000]   It's a simple point of view.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:28.640]   It's very straightforward.
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:29.680]   And think about me.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.920]   A lot of 90% of everything is crap, right?
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:33.760]   That's the rule of thumb and product evaluation.
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.640]   Or at least a rule in life, one or the other.
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.280]   I love everything and everybody.
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:42.000]   We'll just full of life.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:42.480]   Blimey.
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:43.200]   Yeah.
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:46.240]   No, but none of us love everyone and everybody.
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:46.480]   All right.
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.280]   Well, it's a couple of more.
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:48.320]   Get to the point.
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.400]   The point being, first of all, they're not going to do
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:51.040]   content.
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:55.280]   They're not going to distribute video at six megabits per second.
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:56.880]   That's what they're accepting submissions
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.800]   from their partners that are posting video.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:12:59.280]   John's right.
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:02.400]   The interesting question is whether it's fairly easy to scale,
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:03.680]   peer-to-peer content sharing.
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:10.160]   And it's fairly easy to scale Skype by comparison to scaling
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:14.640]   juice because you're talking about a 500 KBPS download,
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:17.840]   larger in areas in countries where everybody's got a higher
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.560]   typical bandwidth feed than they do in the United States.
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.200]   There's some interesting stuff going on.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.720]   You're talking about 350 megabytes per hour at a time
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:30.320]   when the rumors are starting up hot and heavy that Comcast
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:33.360]   just starting to hammer people for 200 gigabytes a month of--
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.320]   Yeah, I like that.
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.520]   You're unlimited bandwidth?
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:36.720]   Well, it's 200 gigabytes.
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:37.840]   Yeah.
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:42.560]   Well, let's not get sidetracked and start yelling about that yet.
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:46.320]   I have to say that if you're going to do IPTV,
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:48.400]   you don't worry right now that it's on the computer.
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.400]   Eventually, everything that's on your computer,
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.080]   eventually when my Apple TV arrives,
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.240]   everything that's on your computer is going to be on your screen.
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:57.520]   I don't think that's a red herring, John.
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.840]   I do grant you a couple of things.
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:03.280]   First of all, it's completely stupid and bone-headed
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.360]   via a com-to-pullot stuff off YouTube.
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.280]   That's just a great promotional vehicle.
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:08.720]   I agree with you.
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:11.680]   The notion that somehow juiced is piracy proof
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.080]   where YouTube is not is also bone-headed.
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.920]   Well, I don't see why they shouldn't do both.
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.720]   With all due respect to YouTube and via com,
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.600]   it's not like a via com is really suffering for promotion right now.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:25.760]   They have some of the most essential basic channels on cable.
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.560]   Yeah, but they have huge benefits from YouTube
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:29.680]   with Saturday Night Live.
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:30.320]   Why?
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.800]   What makes via com so much better than NBC?
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:36.320]   I mean, there's a lot of vibacom programming.
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.760]   It's got a lot more relevant than...
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.760]   I mean, think about how many people here have been watching,
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:42.800]   have been watching Saturday Night Live on and off
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:44.480]   for what, three decades now?
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:46.640]   And how many times did you tune out for three or four years?
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:49.200]   Because it sucked and then the cast got better again
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.280]   and you sit there and think like, wow, this...
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:52.400]   Well, you just made the point.
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.160]   It's a valuable promotional vehicle.
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:56.480]   You think via com doesn't need that promotion from time to time?
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.000]   No, maybe they don't think they do.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.240]   I mean, it's one place where the networks
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:03.200]   don't have the same kind of authority that they used to,
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.760]   which is the ability to suddenly call upon a large audience.
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.560]   And what happens with something like a popular YouTube video
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.440]   or as a result of the dig effect is to suddenly see
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:13.920]   this explosion in activity around one piece of media.
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.960]   And I think you get that if you spend a lot of money
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.960]   and if you're somebody like via com.
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.880]   But I mean, for example, something like the Craig Ferguson
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:23.040]   remarks about Britney Spears, something like that.
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:27.120]   That just but this 1230PM show on a lot of people's radars
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.480]   for the first time.
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.640]   So I mean, it's not perfect for everybody in all cases,
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:32.560]   but I agree that it's a little bit boneheaded
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:34.160]   not to see the value of that.
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.920]   Use YouTube doesn't mean you can't do juiced at the same time.
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:38.960]   You know, I hear rumors.
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.720]   I hear rumors and I'm not...
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:41.840]   Don't have to be all scot-borne here,
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:45.680]   but from what I hear, that basically the people who are more
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:48.400]   in the kind of the production end of stuff like The Daily Show,
[00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.080]   they're the ones who are putting this stuff up.
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:52.240]   And it's kind of this running joke that they're the guys
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.160]   who are putting this stuff up minutes after it's gone.
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:56.800]   And then the legal people from a different part
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:57.920]   of the building run and take it down.
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.920]   So, you know, not to make the obvious point here,
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.960]   but saying things like via com, well, I mean,
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.160]   that's not that meaningful.
[00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:05.680]   There's a lot of cells inside of via com.
[00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:06.720]   It's not just via com.
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:11.280]   The deal between Google and CBS has fallen apart as well.
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.760]   But then they're also building a relationship with the BBC.
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:14.800]   That might be happening soon.
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.080]   But I think YouTube is a lot at fault for the whole content
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:21.360]   companies taking their content off of YouTube for a lot of reasons.
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.360]   I think they have to work out their whole piracy.
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:24.240]   Has they been in police?
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.720]   Yeah, they are just not living up to their end of the bargain.
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:29.280]   And I know they have the technology to do so.
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.720]   Well, Google has made big announcements
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:32.400]   about how they're going to do that from now on.
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.520]   Well, they say they're going to do it,
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:35.200]   but they don't give a hard deadline when.
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.840]   He just says soon, you know, and soon is not good enough
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.520]   for via com and CBS.
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:42.320]   I also wonder if part of the reason the CBS deal fell apart
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:45.760]   is because, you know, that YouTube was kind of making it.
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:49.520]   You have to have a district like a licensing agreement with us before.
[00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:54.240]   You have to have a partnership with us before we do any kind of searching for copyright.
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.200]   You're copywriting.
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:57.120]   Well, they don't even have the right to say that.
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.600]   The DMCA gives you the takedown.
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:02.160]   No, the DMCA does not apply here, Leo,
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:05.600]   because the DMCA is because for its copy protected material
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:08.080]   and broadcast television is not copy protected.
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:10.640]   No, they've been giving DMCA notices too.
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:11.280]   What is it?
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.440]   Yeah, they call it the DMCA takedown notice.
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:14.480]   What does that mean?
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:17.600]   Well, okay, first of all, the takedown notice,
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:24.400]   what's interesting about the takedown notice is especially because, oh gosh.
[00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.280]   The DMCA is a copyright act.
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:30.160]   It doesn't, I know you're thinking about the encryption issue,
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.640]   but it also protects copyrighted content.
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:36.640]   Right, but it doesn't, but it doesn't protect copyrighted
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:39.040]   content that is not copy protected.
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:39.760]   Not so at all.
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:40.480]   That's not true.
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.560]   It protects copyright act.
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:44.720]   It protects all copyrighted content.
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.720]   I mean, you could do that for somebody,
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:49.680]   you could notice someone who puts up your book, right?
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.280]   I mean, it doesn't have to be electronic.
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:51.840]   No, no, no, no.
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:53.760]   You have the right to do a DMCA takedown.
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:56.880]   And frankly, it's, I don't understand how Google can say,
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.800]   well, if you're not a partner, we're not going to pay attention.
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:00.160]   I'm sorry.
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.720]   Well, if you're not a partner, they're not going to give you access to their tool.
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:04.880]   Well, yeah, they reneged on that whole partnership thing,
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.240]   and they're going to open it up to everyone.
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.440]   They just don't say when.
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:07.760]   Right.
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:08.960]   All right.
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:09.920]   Well, what do you like that?
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.360]   You know, we're going to wrap this up.
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.840]   You know, I think Google should just cut these guys off
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.200]   since they're in a legal tangle with them.
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.600]   You know, I think it just cut them off from all searches.
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.640]   I think what they should just say, hey, all search,
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:21.920]   you search for anything on Google.
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:24.960]   There's not anything it relates to the CPS or Viacom because of their.
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.080]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:27.520]   There's a way to fight that.
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:27.920]   Cut them off.
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:28.960]   See how they like that one?
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:29.760]   Predatory search.
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.880]   Well, my favorite part of the whole thing was how Viacom asked them to take down
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.440]   videos that weren't even copyrighted material.
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:35.840]   Right.
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:39.680]   From the people that uploaded stuff that had nothing to do with their television.
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:40.960]   Did you ever cover that for Veronica?
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:41.520]   Because I heard that.
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.680]   I mean, like Jonathan Colton mentioned one of his videos that was
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:45.520]   totally Creative Commons got taken down.
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:46.400]   You might as well ask people.
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:46.880]   A lot of people.
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:47.280]   And her.
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:47.840]   Why not?
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:48.240]   You know?
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.440]   Yeah, it happened to.
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.600]   We actually got an email from one guy that happened to.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:55.040]   And people were then saying that he should go and sue them for
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:58.080]   doing stuff with his intellectual property.
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.280]   It's on for what?
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:00.240]   Doing keyword search.
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.160]   I mean, you got to want to do it.
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.440]   Just doing like some kind of keyword search.
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:04.160]   Pull down.
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.480]   Yeah, they pulled down a video that was not there.
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.800]   That was someone else's original content.
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:11.040]   It's not a right to be on YouTube.
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:12.480]   You don't have a right to be there.
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:15.120]   They can pull you down any reason, even though it's a bad reason.
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:15.600]   Oh, right.
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:16.240]   It's a side though.
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.680]   I mean, that's not cool.
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:20.880]   I mean, why would you want to like log into YouTube one day and have all your
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:25.120]   personal videos being taken down because you came up on some search from Viacom?
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:26.160]   I wouldn't want it.
[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:29.920]   No, I mean, it's nothing I'd be glad to see, but it's going to happen.
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:32.080]   And yeah, and it becomes like a fiasco.
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:33.520]   Let me eventually get resolved.
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.600]   I think I'm talking this up with a bow and say,
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:39.520]   what we're seeing here is the dinosaurs of media, the networks who,
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:42.560]   first they said, we're going to do a YouTube competitor, but they can't,
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:45.120]   they hate each other so much, they can't figure out how to do that.
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.880]   They're pulling themselves out of YouTube.
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:48.800]   These dinosaurs, they don't get it.
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:52.480]   It's just another way that they're out.
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:58.720]   I think juiced, if there's any rap against it, it's playing the game the dinosaur way,
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:01.280]   and it may not really be the best way to do it.
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:04.400]   Things like Democracy Player may be a better form of IPTV.
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:06.640]   If it would just consistently work and not crash.
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:07.520]   It just has to work.
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:09.280]   There's a lot of junk out there.
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:13.680]   There's a, you know, I mean, if that would be the rap I'd have against a juice,
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:15.680]   it's the old broadcast model.
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:18.720]   I think it's pretty promising as a IPTV.
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.000]   So what do you like about it?
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.040]   It's the UI that you like.
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:24.240]   Well, I love the UI and the quality is just incredible.
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.120]   It's just really good.
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.080]   See the great quality.
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:26.800]   You didn't think so.
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:31.360]   It looks great on my T42, which is my work laptop.
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.200]   That's a small laptop and a small screen.
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.400]   You're not putting it on a big screen.
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.960]   On 30 inch screen, it looks like what you'd expect,
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:38.960]   a worse than VHS quality.
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:43.920]   Speaking of Google, they made a pretty big play for Microsoft's business
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.400]   by announcing their new enterprise offices.
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:49.040]   Should Microsoft be shaken in their boots?
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.320]   John C. de Worek?
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:51.120]   Well, of course not.
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:53.600]   I mean, this is just their old stuff that they package in the other one.
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:54.640]   Yeah, but it's the enterprise edition.
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:55.680]   Money for it?
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:59.120]   Nothing, and he thinks this is not the greatest office suite in the world.
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:03.520]   And you can go get an office suite for free from any number of open source.
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:03.840]   Yeah.
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:07.520]   If Microsoft has anything to worry about, it's that officelive.com,
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:10.640]   that other people who are suing them for the office live name.
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.120]   Oh, really?
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:12.880]   I didn't know they were going to say the name.
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.000]   Oh, that's not so true.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   Someone already has the patent on that name.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:16.480]   Oops.
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:16.480]   Oops.
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:16.960]   See?
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:17.600]   Office live.
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:18.080]   That's all right.
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:18.880]   They're contesting it.
[00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:21.520]   They could take the $1.5 billion they're giving to Alcatel.
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:23.680]   And to just get out and never.
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:25.120]   That's a big story.
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:27.440]   They're never going to give them any $0.10.
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.280]   I mean, that whole suit is the worst.
[00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:30.640]   Let's talk about that in seven.
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:31.760]   Sorry, go back to Google.
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:38.480]   A lot of big companies are already signing up saying we like the, we want to use Google mail.
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:41.760]   We don't need a heavy duty word processor or a spreadsheet.
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:45.520]   This works for us, but you don't think it's a threat at all to Microsoft.
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.440]   These people wouldn't be using office?
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.600]   I don't see where the threat is.
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.680]   I mean, the people who use, I mean, it's a different market.
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:54.320]   It seems to me these are just tight wads.
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:55.840]   And I don't think anybody who does it.
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:59.120]   By the way, I don't like except the Google Mail is a good product.
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:00.480]   And I use the calendar too, which I think is.
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:01.440]   The spreadsheet's not bad.
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:02.800]   I got to tell you, the spreadsheet's pretty good.
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:02.800]   It works.
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:03.520]   It does the job.
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:08.400]   I mean, why would I be paying 50 bucks a month when I just, I just help people to get individual
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:12.560]   account or a year, get individual accounts, you know, personal accounts and use them.
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:14.320]   Well, the support and storage is good.
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:16.960]   Yeah, you get 10 gigs of storage per $50 user.
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:19.520]   24/7 phone support.
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:21.280]   I don't know.
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:25.680]   I mean, I think it's probably going to do well, but I don't think it's going to
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.920]   affect Microsoft's bottom line yet.
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:30.400]   Well, what they really need is a good presentation app.
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.760]   They don't have anything like PowerPoint.
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:32.160]   And you know what?
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:35.600]   If you're right, people need to buy office if just for PowerPoint.
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:39.280]   I don't see Excel going away anytime soon.
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:43.840]   I mean, you can replace a word processor, but that Excel's not going to go away.
[00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:45.280]   Even I can't sustain this one.
[00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:46.560]   Never mind forget I said anything.
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:52.080]   Well, I mean, well, you know, the big come, the people who did the big corporations that use
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.240]   word or publishing house or anybody else.
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:58.960]   I mean, one of the things they use it for is the feature where you can kind of track all the changes
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:03.440]   in a very elaborate way, which does nothing out there like that.
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:07.200]   I mean, you just have to use word and you have to use a new version of it or a fairly new version
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.520]   for the, for the feature to work correctly.
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:10.800]   And it's an important feature.
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:15.280]   And unless somebody has that available, I don't see that having any impact.
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:18.240]   I've been trying to get into using Google Docs and spreadsheets myself.
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:22.320]   And I just always keep going back to Microsoft Office, especially for the docs.
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.000]   Like it just doesn't do enough for me.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.200]   Maybe I'm not getting into it enough.
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:25.680]   I don't know.
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.840]   No, it's frustrating because it's a web experience.
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.520]   It's a little laggy and.
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:30.160]   It's luggage.
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:30.640]   Yeah.
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:30.800]   Yeah.
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:34.480]   So how now I thought now somebody needs to explain this to me.
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:35.520]   Maybe Patrick can do this.
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:39.520]   It's I thought that Fraunhofer owned the patents for MP3.
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:44.640]   But for some reason, a US court is ordering Microsoft to pay Alcatel, the French telecom.
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:50.160]   $1.5 billion because they violated their patents on MP3.
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:54.480]   Hey, can I, can I, let Patrick fill in the blanks and let me give you a quick run down
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:58.960]   of this, which is the situation that if you really boil it down is the following.
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.800]   Fraunhofer bought loosened.
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:07.040]   Loosen was in, it was in the consortium with Fraunhofer and all their MP3 pounds.
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:12.400]   You can't do these kinds of licenses unless you have a consortium and Fraunhofer owns MP3.
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:15.200]   But they're on behalf of a whole bunch of licensees.
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:22.480]   So Alcatel tell buys, loosen, and then they find a rogue patent that's not in the portfolio.
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.000]   And they say, hey, look at this.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.080]   And instead of putting it in the portfolio like they should, if they were good little boys,
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:30.400]   they decide to start suing everybody over it.
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:34.080]   Saying, well, you know, we didn't throw it in because we didn't know it was there or whatever.
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:37.200]   And they make this crazy story up in the idiots in the court system.
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.960]   We just don't know how to deal with patents at all.
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:44.640]   Throw the book at Microsoft for the biggest judgment in history.
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:45.680]   Give me a break.
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:48.400]   This isn't going to get very far, Patrick.
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:52.160]   That was going to argue with you.
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:58.000]   I'm going to have an interesting moment for anybody who enjoys watching video online.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.800]   Spend some time looking around the sort of MPEGLA group,
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:06.880]   MPEGLA.com, who basically administers, is the consortium that administers all of the rights for
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:10.800]   MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 and a few other things.
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:19.680]   And essentially, they reserve the right to charge anybody who wants to encode in those formats.
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:25.200]   And if you make money off of those formats, any kind of volume, they want their percentage
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.880]   because of the way the licenses are...
[00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:27.920]   And isn't there a time to treat it?
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.440]   And that's how it's doing with MP3, too.
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:32.640]   But they were paying the licensing already to...
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:38.080]   Yeah, well, what I guess what I'm saying is it's as ridiculous as this sounds.
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:42.960]   In a couple of years, if the MPEGLA renegotiates their agreement on MPEG-4,
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:47.760]   and MPEG-2, they could actually try to start collecting money off of every
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:49.360]   free download on the web.
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:52.720]   It's that thin line between the front of mind is the lawyer.
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.400]   It is, I looked at him one day and I'm like,
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:57.440]   "So you're basically telling me the law is about semantic arguments
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:02.320]   and has nothing to do with common sense or anything that actually makes."
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:03.920]   Well, the word is it means...
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:09.840]   Yeah, well, actually, if this 1.5 billion award looks like a lot,
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:14.720]   it could be dwarfed by the AT&T case, which is being argued in front of the Supreme Court.
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:20.400]   AT&T is also suing Microsoft over sound recognition and technology in the windows.
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:26.880]   And in fact, there are some say that a victory for AT&T could hold all US-based technology
[00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:32.560]   defendants internationally liable in future patent suits, vastly inflating any damages and
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:38.080]   awards. This front offer thing could be nothing compared to the AT&T suit.
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:39.040]   I didn't hear about that.
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:40.880]   Yeah, they're arguing it right now.
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:46.560]   Yeah, the other thing is by the way, not the front offer, but loose in Alcatel.
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:53.120]   That's only one of, I think, five or six total suits that are in the pipeline on this one issue.
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:27:02.000]   This doesn't include the Xbox suit that these guys hit Microsoft with over some tweak,
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.160]   which is all I'd call it, a ridiculous little suit.
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:10.240]   And so then Microsoft last Friday filed four suits against Alcatel,
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:15.120]   Lucid for telephone connectivity to the internet or something, some telephony thing,
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:19.120]   which really would go right after the core business of those guys.
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:20.800]   It's kind of like nuclear war. It's like literally a short dis...
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:23.280]   It's just mutually a short destruction.
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:29.360]   Well, at least Bill Gates has time to monitor his 10-year-old daughter's computer usage.
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:30.800]   Vista Pinata.
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:35.280]   That's her favorite game. He says, "Chicken spent two or three hours a day on this
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:38.240]   Viva Pinata because it's kind of engaging and fun."
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:41.520]   Someone was making a Vista Pinata joke earlier today also.
[00:27:41.520 --> 00:27:42.640]   You hit it and it breaks?
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:45.200]   Was this on Buzzat Laughter?
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:48.160]   No, we didn't talk about it. I saw it somewhere else earlier today.
[00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:48.960]   Vista Pinata.
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.000]   That game is awesome.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.200]   You play Viva Pinata.
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:52.560]   Right.
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:53.280]   Full of...
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:54.480]   It's kind of sick, isn't it?
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.080]   I haven't played it.
[00:27:56.080 --> 00:28:01.280]   You break these pinatas and then all the other pinatas come over and eat the insides of their
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:04.000]   friend that they used to hang out with. It's kind of sad.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.680]   It's cannibalistic pinatas.
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:06.400]   Yeah.
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:08.800]   I'm kind of more intrigued by that voice you did, Leo.
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:09.920]   I mean, that doesn't sound anything.
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:11.200]   Bill Gates just kind of...
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:11.840]   I'm thinking...
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:12.720]   That was the one word.
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:13.920]   The one word was Sean voice.
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:16.480]   It's inconceivable.
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:17.280]   You can see it.
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:21.520]   Bill Gates said she became very evident, discovered a lot of computer games,
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:27.120]   including one that runs on the Xbox 360 called Viva Pinata, where you take care of your garden.
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:28.480]   Is there a garden Viva Pinata?
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:28.880]   Yes.
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:29.920]   You have a garden.
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.240]   Would you like me to explain Viva Pinata to you?
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:32.400]   No.
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.320]   Oh, I heard about the Shlomo was talking about this.
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:35.840]   This sounds really fun.
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:37.200]   Oh, Shlomo plays it too.
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.720]   Yeah, you put her around in a garden.
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:40.960]   I got to send pinatas to Shlomo then.
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:42.080]   You can send pinatas?
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.080]   Yeah, you can share pinatas with people.
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:44.880]   So you breed them.
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:45.680]   You have a garden.
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:46.480]   I'm going to tell you anyway.
[00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:48.160]   Is this an Xbox game or what Xbox?
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:48.480]   Yeah.
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:49.600]   I guess I need to get it.
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:50.640]   It's highly addictive.
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:52.240]   Because I know I'm never playing you in Gears of War.
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:52.720]   It's for kids.
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:53.760]   Because you're just going to throw a great game.
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:54.800]   It's one of those things that...
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:55.200]   Yeah.
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:55.760]   Yeah.
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.440]   It's geared towards children.
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:01.200]   It's geared towards children, but it's got that kind of sim-like aspect
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.120]   that's very attractive to people.
[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:06.640]   You can design your own pinatas and send them to people.
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:08.000]   It's really fun.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.360]   Now you sound like Ed Win.
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:12.880]   How do they miss their Ed?
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:18.960]   Anyway, Bill says that his daughter, who's now 10, is the oldest kid,
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:21.920]   he's actually limiting her screen time.
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:23.680]   Very restrictive.
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.600]   Tell me what you think.
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:28.640]   45 minutes a day of total screen time for games.
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:31.920]   An hour a day on weekends plus, if you need to do homework,
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:33.040]   you could add that to the total.
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:34.640]   An hour a day on weekends?
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:36.640]   Oh, what is he?
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:37.600]   A Nazi?
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:39.040]   Does that include rebooting?
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:39.680]   Oh my god.
[00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:43.520]   He's Bill freaking Gates and he's letting his kid be on the computer for an hour.
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:45.920]   Bill Gates is not a big gamer.
[00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:48.880]   Bill Gates is a, you know, he's the best line of all this.
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:50.240]   Does that include rebooting?
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.040]   It's a great line.
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:51.760]   I'm stealing it.
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:54.720]   Does it count, dear?
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:58.560]   Does it count when I have to reboot Vista a few times to install?
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:29:59.280]   Constantly.
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:00.720]   Does that count?
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:01.200]   No, no.
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.800]   We'll play this for a relaxing blue screen.
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:03.120]   Watch.
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:05.040]   The next version, the first service pack of Vista,
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:08.480]   will have a special timer that subtracts reboot time.
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.080]   So it'll be very easy for parents.
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:12.880]   Do you guys, so do you do, do you set limits like that, Leo?
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:14.080]   Oh, do you have you in the past?
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:14.480]   You bet.
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:14.800]   Really?
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:16.960]   And we do, and it's interesting that he uses the word screen time,
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:19.280]   because it really is, it's not, nowadays with kids,
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:23.840]   it's not just the computer, it's TV, it's, my son will go upstairs
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:26.000]   and watch the office on his video iPod.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.160]   So it has to be all screens, you know.
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:30.640]   Man, you become like a lawyer when you're a father.
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:32.320]   Oh, believe me.
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:35.440]   It's not that the father's the lawyer, it's that the kids are the lawyers.
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:36.880]   Like he finds a, he finds a,
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.240]   a little poll here for you.
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:40.160]   Hey, I've always let the kids self-regulate,
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:40.640]   and you know what?
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:42.000]   They get sick of it.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:42.720]   Yeah, I did that.
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:44.480]   I was, I had no kind of regulation.
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:46.960]   And once they get sick of it, then they're totally self-regulate.
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.400]   You don't have to, because if you start saying,
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:50.560]   "You can't do this, you can't do this, you can't do that,"
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:51.600]   and they're going to want to do it.
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:53.680]   But if you just say, "Go do it until you're bored stiff,"
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:55.200]   they get, and guess what?
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:56.640]   They get bored stiff.
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:59.440]   Just next thing is, you're going to read those include phones.
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:02.880]   My kids do spend more time with, do no limitations like that.
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.960]   They spend more time reading than they ever have before.
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.160]   Yeah, I think you're probably right.
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:07.200]   It's too late for us though.
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.160]   We've gone down that road.
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:09.280]   Because if you hold it back from them,
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:10.400]   they're just going to want to do it more.
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:10.560]   Yeah.
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:14.320]   So Veronica, your folks never said to you,
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:16.880]   there's limits on any of this stuff?
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:18.320]   No, not really.
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:20.000]   I mean, there were a couple of shows I couldn't watch,
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.280]   but in terms of, of playing video games or watching TV.
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:24.720]   You found out what John's saying that after a while,
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:25.600]   you just kind of got tired of it.
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:26.560]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:26.720]   Yeah.
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:28.240]   So I should do it.
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:30.080]   I have a very short attention span.
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:34.400]   So say there's no obsessive compulsive disorder type people in their room.
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:37.680]   So I should do an experiment with Henry and just say,
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.920]   "Okay, Henry, do whatever you want."
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:40.480]   No, wait a minute.
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:42.400]   Now does that mean he can do anything he wants?
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:43.760]   Or there are some limits?
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:44.800]   Well, I mean, come on.
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:45.120]   Yeah.
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:47.520]   Like he's not going to go like kill cats or anything.
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:48.640]   I can't afford out of fudge.
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:50.640]   I bought dead rising for him, right?
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:51.920]   And my wife's furious at me.
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:57.440]   She says, "My son is, you made, he's killing zombies in the mall with a tire iron."
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:59.680]   That is a great game.
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:01.520]   I watched my son play it.
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:02.240]   It's a terrific game.
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:02.960]   It's a really good game.
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:07.120]   It's entertaining for the whole family to watch somebody who knows how to play that game play it.
[00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:07.760]   You know what?
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:08.720]   He gets sick of it too.
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:09.280]   He got tired.
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:10.240]   He killed enough zombies.
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:10.960]   That was the end of it.
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:12.640]   They keep coming.
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:14.400]   They don't move fast, but they keep coming.
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.000]   There's many, many of them.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.440]   There's a lot of them.
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:18.800]   No, I enjoy that game, actually.
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:19.280]   Yeah.
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:21.840]   There's the game play and that's quite surprisingly good.
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:23.040]   Yeah, that's a good game.
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:24.400]   It's no viva piñata.
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:25.440]   Oh, no.
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:26.720]   And it teaches them how to be.
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:29.280]   And the great thing about it's educational because it's about a journal.
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.960]   It teaches them how to do journalism.
[00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:33.440]   Yeah, I don't get that part.
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:36.400]   You're taking pictures and you get points for taking good pictures.
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:37.920]   I mean, it's zombies.
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:40.000]   It's not like it's real people or anything.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:40.800]   I mean, that's never going to happen.
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:42.320]   Well, zombies are eating real people.
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:42.640]   Oh, wow.
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:45.120]   Oh, he saw it killing zombies was a good thing.
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:48.080]   Much better than running over the little old ladies in the field.
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:51.200]   Every child needs good zombie killing skills before they get into, you know.
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:52.000]   I'll give you an example.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:52.560]   Elementary school.
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:54.480]   You can get a shower head, right?
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:56.080]   I don't know where it's lying around the mall.
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:01.360]   And the goal is you stick the shower, you jam the shower head into the zombies head
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:03.600]   and blood gushes out of the shower head.
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:05.920]   That's just good clean fun.
[00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:07.360]   Did you see that part?
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:08.400]   That was a good one.
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.080]   No, I didn't see that, but I wish I did.
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:14.400]   That's that's when my wife decides to walk in the room.
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:17.760]   Did you see what the the toothpaste for dinner guy had to say about second life?
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.040]   Did you see his post on that?
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:19.600]   Wait, no.
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:21.680]   First of all, who is the toothpaste for dinner guy?
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:22.560]   Oh, he's this cartoonist.
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:24.560]   Did you go to toothpastefordinner.com?
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:25.600]   He does wonderful cartoons.
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:28.000]   But you saw your Twitter on that yesterday.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.600]   I downloaded something called second life.
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:32.160]   It's like grand theft auto Andreas, except you can't shoot one.
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:32.960]   You can't hit people.
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:33.440]   You just walk around.
[00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:33.920]   I did read that.
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:34.720]   I didn't read that.
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:35.040]   There's no prostitutes.
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:35.840]   Everything costs money.
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:37.120]   You can't rob anyone to get money.
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:40.160]   And they kept asking, how do you kill people or how do you hit people?
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:42.640]   Can't kill them.
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:43.840]   There are prostitutes though.
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:46.000]   Did you see the I'm not going to go too deeply into this,
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.960]   but the post about sex shopping and second life?
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:51.600]   I was kind of amazed what you could buy.
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:52.800]   I absolutely moved.
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:54.000]   Well, what can you buy?
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:54.640]   Well, tell us.
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:56.480]   Some of them are used to you getting into it.
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.760]   No, no, I was reading a post.
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:58.320]   I actually did.
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:59.520]   Or a friend told me.
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:00.880]   A friend told me.
[00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:03.200]   The guy I know he was buying some.
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:04.000]   You could buy.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:04.560]   Stop.
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:06.160]   Pretty appalling stuff.
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:08.000]   So what did it say in the post, Leo?
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:11.040]   I can't say it on the show because we'll lose our coin tag.
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.400]   Well, send us a link.
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:13.360]   So he's standing there.
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:19.120]   He's, first of all, he's looking at, you can buy body parts in various stages.
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:22.560]   In on their own stages and a bag.
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:24.320]   You just get an exercise.
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:28.080]   Let us think of what body parts are in the context of stages.
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:29.360]   Yeah, I think it's stages.
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:31.600]   And you apply it to your body.
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:34.800]   In other words, body parts in second life are just like clothing.
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:35.440]   They're skins.
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:36.480]   They're skins.
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:38.080]   So you apply it by yourself.
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:38.640]   Literally.
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:40.240]   And it becomes a gesture.
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:41.360]   So you can make gestures.
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:44.000]   Why are you so surprised at this?
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.440]   I mean, chat rooms, online games, everything.
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:48.640]   I'm not surprised at it.
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:49.840]   I'm shocked.
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.400]   All right, here's an interesting story.
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:53.840]   And I'd love to get your take on this.
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:58.320]   19 year old kid in Langley, British Columbia, doesn't have a lot to do,
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:59.360]   doesn't have a lot of friends.
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:05.360]   He sits in his basement basically 16 hours a day, monitoring other people.
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:12.400]   See, it seems this kid has made a Trojan horse, which he put on the news groups for child pornography.
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:14.960]   And sliver with a purpose.
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:16.720]   And people, it's sex like sliver.
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:18.320]   And people download this thing now.
[00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:20.560]   They're because it's on a child pornography news group,
[00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:23.440]   apparently one presumes they're all child pornographers.
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:28.240]   He then for three years has been watching these people,
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:31.360]   their email, reading their email, tracking their every step online.
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:31.840]   Oh, God.
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:33.760]   This was his life.
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:34.960]   He had no friends in school.
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:35.920]   He skipped the prom.
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:37.360]   He just stayed home and doing this.
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:39.200]   But it gets more interesting.
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:40.880]   Kind of a meta pornography.
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:42.320]   Yeah, that's weird.
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:49.280]   He got a United States judge arrested and convicted of child pornography.
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:50.640]   Oh my God.
[00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:51.840]   Despite ignoring police.
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:53.040]   There's this story that I don't see it on the list.
[00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:53.840]   Yeah, I don't either.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:54.880]   Secret life of a son.
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:55.920]   They were making that up.
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:57.440]   Secret life of a cyber hero.
[00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:04.400]   I got on this story because I was reading about this judge getting convicted of child porn.
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:06.640]   And then they said it was very interesting how he got caught.
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:10.160]   The kid ignored police threats of arrest because it's vigilante.
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:15.840]   Instead pressed ahead, in the case of Orange County Superior Court Judge Ronald Klein,
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:21.440]   after reading the judge's electronic diary, he concluded it showed an apparent plot to sexually
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.680]   exploit young boys at a private health club.
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:25.520]   He turned him in.
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:31.840]   He was the judge was arrested and convicted and US detectives credit the kid alone
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:33.840]   for breaking the case.
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:35.760]   So he used his creepy powers for good.
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:36.960]   Well, did he?
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:38.880]   Is it a, I mean, is this okay?
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:43.360]   Well, I, I was, I've been doing this the whole time, like secretly, like been going around
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:46.560]   and tipping off the police whenever he found some information that something like that was
[00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:47.280]   going to happen.
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:52.960]   Oh, then that might be kind of good in a boondock sense kind of way, but I don't really know.
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:54.800]   I don't know.
[00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.400]   This is, this vigilante stuff is so hot right now.
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:59.680]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, there's, there's the one show where they do nothing but go out and
[00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:01.600]   like find Hicks trying to have sex with kids.
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:02.080]   Yeah.
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:02.640]   Like a whole show.
[00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:03.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:04.320]   Yeah, that's pretty pathetic.
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:07.200]   But they find that, yeah, that, that, that, that catch up predator.
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:08.800]   And you know the word, we're thinking about it.
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:12.880]   I think there's something really sick about that because the guys, they catch are the
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:18.560]   dumbest guys and you feel so like what this guy is he isn't going to get a date with anybody.
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:20.560]   He's got his cross side.
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:22.560]   He believed whoever it was that was on the thing.
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:26.880]   And you look at the guy and you go, my God, and this is what was this a public service?
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:28.560]   There's probably some really bad guys out there.
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:29.280]   Go catch them.
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:30.480]   It's pretty close to me.
[00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:35.440]   This kid, it is, it seems like it, but this kid seems to me to be, I don't see how he's
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:37.120]   that much different than a private detective.
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:38.880]   They're doing a crap like this all the time.
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:40.720]   But the difference, well, it's vigilante though.
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:41.520]   What's the difference?
[00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:44.720]   Because a private detective is a, is a, is a, is a police officer.
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.560]   I guess you really need to know his motives.
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:48.320]   Like why did he start doing it in the first place?
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:51.360]   That's why, if I were the judge, I would totally go, well, you see, I was working to
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:52.320]   a trap this guy.
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:52.800]   Yeah.
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:53.600]   He's vigilante.
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:57.040]   That's why I had to go out there and put my neck on the line with, you know, doing this stuff.
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:58.400]   Oh, why would a judge do that?
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:59.840]   The judge is now under house arrest.
[00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:00.400]   It's a good lie.
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:04.640]   I think after three years of documentation, the judge is going to have a long, long way
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:05.840]   to go to prove that one.
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:08.240]   I've made this, my life's worked to track down this guy.
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:12.560]   The judge's defense attorney plans a defense that says because the electronic diary, which
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:17.520]   is the cornerstone of the case, was stolen, the federal grand jury charges should be dropped.
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:18.960]   That might be true.
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:20.800]   It was stolen by a hacker illegally.
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:25.360]   It's not like he had a warrant or anything to go into his private data.
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:26.640]   Now the kid says he stopped.
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:29.520]   His name, I can give out his name.
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:30.160]   But maybe I won't.
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:31.120]   He's a minor.
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:32.960]   It's, it's going to be on my blog.
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:33.520]   All right.
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:35.520]   If it's in the media already, it's been pregame.
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:36.080]   It's already in the video.
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:38.160]   The kid, I still, I'm not going to give it his name.
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:42.400]   The kid says I've stopped because my parents asked me to stop.
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:45.200]   They liked what I was doing, but they don't want me to do anything illegal.
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:47.200]   Sometimes he regrets his online life.
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:48.000]   I'm reading this.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.800]   This is the story by Gary Dimick at crime-research.org.
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:55.200]   Sometimes he regrets his online life.
[00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:56.480]   My whole life has been online.
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:58.320]   I've literally spent half my life on the internet.
[00:38:58.320 --> 00:38:59.840]   I'm anti-social in real life.
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:01.600]   I've been on the computer too much to keep friends.
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:02.880]   I'm trying to get out more.
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:04.560]   And don't tell me about meeting girls.
[00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:05.440]   Boy, oh boy.
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:06.960]   That's me.
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:08.400]   That sounds kind of sad.
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:08.960]   That's so bad.
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:10.800]   No, that's, you know, I know where that's coming.
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:11.920]   That's the classic like, you know,
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:14.960]   he should go out and chase girls instead of spending all that much time on the computer.
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:16.160]   That's like, that's like classic.
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:19.680]   It just kind of worries me that he spent like so many years of his life on
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:22.880]   basically pornography, child pornography, news groups.
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:26.560]   Well, yeah, interesting is his, his, I won't give his real name.
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:28.000]   His codename is omnipotent.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:28.960]   Oh.
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:29.840]   I guess in some ways.
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:33.280]   This is probably a better use for a kid's time than some otherwise.
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:34.320]   Ben v. Bipignada.
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:35.520]   I do not encourage this.
[00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:37.120]   No, I'm not saying the image.
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:37.920]   I'm not encouraging you.
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:40.720]   I mean, why don't we just go out and lynch child pornographers?
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:42.880]   There are introverted kids out there.
[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:45.360]   And a lot of them do not do positive things like this.
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:47.840]   And they all, most of them get over it eventually.
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:50.560]   It's nothing that I, I guess it's freak about.
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:54.960]   Well, I mean, look, you've got, you've got like three or four separate things here.
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:56.560]   You've got the child pornography angle.
[00:39:56.560 --> 00:39:59.040]   You've got the kids sitting out and, you know,
[00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:03.200]   essentially cracking into all these people's systems to monitor them.
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:05.600]   And then you've got the fact that it's, you know, the, you know,
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:10.080]   the internet can be a wonderful place for people who are socially awkward to bury themselves.
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:12.640]   But it's like the library used to be when I was in high school.
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:13.920]   Bring back the library.
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:14.400]   Right.
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:18.240]   Well, you know, you can do, you can, you know, okay, it's probably, you know,
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:22.160]   this guy's obviously, you know, stumbled into some incredibly bizarre stuff,
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:24.640]   but it's not like you can't get your head bent out of shape in a library.
[00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:26.240]   Well, he's a hacker, but he's a hacker for good.
[00:40:26.240 --> 00:40:27.440]   Is there such a thing?
[00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:28.160]   Yeah.
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:28.640]   White hat.
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:31.760]   As long as there's white hat hackers, he will tell you what your vulnerabilities are.
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:32.000]   Right.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.200]   You know, well, the, I mean, the other question is, Adrian Lommel
[00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:38.000]   almost went to jail for that kind of white quote white hacking.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.720]   You know, it's, it's, it's a, it's a term of convenience, I think, more than anything else.
[00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:47.520]   You know, it's not going to matter because, you know, in 2036, an asteroid's going to hit the
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:50.320]   earth at 28,000 miles an hour. And it's all over for us.
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:51.760]   Great.
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:52.880]   That's hopeful.
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:55.440]   By the way, I want to, this guy is going to commercialize it.
[00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:58.400]   He said, according to this article, he wrote the Trojan horse program.
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:40:59.120]   Right.
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:00.800]   I wonder if he, because he's going to commercialize it.
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:01.440]   I mean, Trojan horse.
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:02.080]   Not the date line.
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:04.000]   You show out of it.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:05.360]   They could finally move on to the internet.
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:10.560]   You know, one of the things occurred here in my little town in Petaluma, they rented a house
[00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:15.680]   in the neighborhood and they, they had Petaluma police detectives doing this.
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:20.240]   I don't know why in my little town, they've decided that they've got to stop all child
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:21.520]   molesters. But anyway, they, they, they, they,
[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:26.320]   Because there's child molesters everywhere and it's often much more easy to operate
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:27.760]   undetected and small down.
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:28.400]   That's true.
[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:28.960]   And it is too enlarged.
[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:29.840]   So they sit at the house.
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:30.880]   They invited the people over.
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:34.240]   They had date line cameras and, you know, a bus with handcuffs.
[00:41:34.240 --> 00:41:35.760]   And I was one guy.
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:38.080]   It wasn't one guy that was like, what?
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:38.800]   What I do.
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:39.600]   Like completely.
[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:41.440]   It was like, this is fun.
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:42.960]   I don't understand what the problem is here.
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:46.240]   I blocked that show once where they caught that they brought a guy and he says,
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:47.440]   didn't we see you before?
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:49.040]   Yeah, you got me like a month ago.
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:53.280]   And he was just saying another one of those kind of dumb guys with this, you know,
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:56.160]   you know, maybe we should get these guys off the street.
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:57.200]   Let's be honest.
[00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:00.000]   Oh, there's obviously they didn't get them off the street.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:00.480]   That's the idea that.
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:01.600]   You have these back in a month.
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:07.520]   So scientists as suckered again, scientists estimate a one in 45,000 chance that this
[00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:09.680]   asteroid is going to hit the earth.
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:10.880]   We are so screwed.
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:11.440]   Are you worried?
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:14.560]   Well, didn't they come up with that new system where they're going to have the ship
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:17.760]   that flies over it and uses the ship's gravity to pull it off course?
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:18.880]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:21.520]   It's when they send up the rogue oil driller.
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:22.480]   Yeah, right.
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:23.920]   So we can go up into a million pieces.
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:24.560]   Where's Bruce?
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:25.840]   Well, that's what we need him.
[00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:29.760]   Rusty Schweikert, a former astronaut, but I just like saying his name,
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:33.760]   Rushdie Schweikert said it's not just this asteroid.
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:37.520]   Every country is at risk and we need to set up general principles to deal with the issue.
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:41.680]   He's they actually are proposing a 150 million pound space mission
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:45.760]   to to be launched to deflect the asteroid.
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:49.280]   Can I say something here that seems to be overlooked by all the
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:51.920]   by all the journalists or science writers?
[00:42:51.920 --> 00:42:54.080]   They know where this asteroid is.
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:55.680]   They know what its course is.
[00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:57.760]   They they can do the math.
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:43:00.720]   They pretty much know that the earth, you know, spins around the sun
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:05.200]   in a certain pattern and is a certain point on a certain day of the year.
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:06.640]   Why don't they just do the calculation?
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:07.760]   Why do we have odds?
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:09.120]   Is this like Las Vegas?
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:10.880]   It's now the same thing.
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:12.720]   That's just what the dinosaurs said.
[00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:15.120]   And look where they are now.
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:16.160]   They're taking bets.
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:18.240]   Their equation was slightly off.
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:19.200]   They didn't quite.
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:20.720]   Yeah, a little off.
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:26.640]   According to this article, astronomers warn that between now and 2079, Veronica,
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:28.400]   the only one will still be alive at that.
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:30.960]   So you might want to listen particularly.
[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:35.440]   There will be at least 38 potentially hazardous encounters with rogue asteroids.
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:38.320]   Oh, now we have something to do with all those ICBMs.
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:42.160]   Oh, did you guys feel the earthquake a while back a couple of minutes ago?
[00:43:42.160 --> 00:43:44.000]   Did the earth go for you?
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.280]   Oh, yeah, big time here.
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:46.720]   Where are you?
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:48.560]   Downtown San Francisco.
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:51.040]   Oh, I think I'm with the Jureys Bay.
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:52.240]   It was in Berkeley.
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:53.600]   Yeah, I'm in Berkeley.
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:55.920]   I felt it wasn't that big of a deal.
[00:43:55.920 --> 00:43:58.480]   Yeah, I always get excited because I'm not from around here.
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:00.560]   You're not from a top to get a whopper.
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:02.480]   If John, if you had a tumble log, you could put that on your tumble log.
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:03.680]   You could say I just felt an earthquake.
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:04.480]   Well, I twittered it.
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:04.960]   I could.
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:05.680]   You twittered it, see?
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:07.760]   Where are you going to put that, John?
[00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:08.720]   You got no place to put that.
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:09.760]   We're not from around here.
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:09.760]   I just did.
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:10.960]   I put it on the podcast.
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:12.640]   What are you from, Veronica?
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:14.320]   I am originally from Connecticut.
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:16.240]   Oh, yeah, they don't have earthquakes there.
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:17.680]   Actually, they do.
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:18.480]   Not lately.
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:19.760]   No, not so much.
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:23.280]   Oh, you're going to love when they get a big five or six.
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:25.120]   I don't know.
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:26.880]   A 3.4 where you work.
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:28.640]   I can't imagine even feeling it.
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:30.800]   Well, our building is on like rollers.
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:34.160]   So whenever there's an earthquake, it actually does shift pretty significantly.
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:35.440]   It's in a safe building.
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:36.560]   It's a bad feeling.
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:38.480]   No, it does not feel good.
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:38.720]   Yeah.
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:40.160]   It was kind of cool at the same time.
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:41.680]   Yeah, I grew up on the East Coast too.
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:44.080]   Like, you know, hurricanes, fine, whatever, you know,
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:46.000]   tornadoes in the Midwest, I've dealt with them.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.200]   But the whole, you know, when a building the size of a city block
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:52.480]   does this sort of 10 millimeter shift, right, in quivers?
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:54.960]   That's just not in my idea of how--
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:56.800]   What a bunch of East Coast weenies.
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:57.120]   Yeah.
[00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:59.120]   Hey, hey, hey, I don't know about that.
[00:44:59.120 --> 00:44:59.680]   I don't know about that.
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:04.000]   You know, we go take a boat out when the hurricanes are coming in.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.800]   Or why don't you come over when it's like a negative 20 wind chill
[00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:08.080]   and five feet of snow?
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:09.200]   You'll love it.
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:12.160]   So it looks like John, you were writing--
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:12.720]   East things.
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:13.040]   Go ahead.
[00:45:13.040 --> 00:45:13.920]   I'll go ahead.
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:14.080]   I'll go ahead.
[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:16.480]   We'll have a little more earthquake talk than I'm going to move on.
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:18.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:20.320]   You couldn't have felt it up there.
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:21.280]   No, I don't feel anything.
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:21.920]   But I don't feel anything.
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:22.560]   I don't feel anything.
[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:25.120]   Midwest and Midwest owners have tornado talk on their podcast.
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:26.880]   I don't know.
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:28.800]   That's a good name for a podcast, tornado talk.
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:30.240]   Time for tornado talk.
[00:45:30.240 --> 00:45:33.840]   We're sitting in the basement right now waiting for the big one
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:34.640]   to come through.
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:37.840]   So you were right, John, about SED.
[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:44.880]   Cannon now has lost that lawsuit against nano proprietary,
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:49.040]   which means that pretty much SED is dead.
[00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:50.480]   But it's not dead.
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:51.440]   It's just dead.
[00:45:51.440 --> 00:45:54.880]   It's just completely being run by Cannon now.
[00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:55.520]   It's been a game.
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:55.760]   It's been a game.
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:56.160]   It's been a game.
[00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:56.160]   It's been a game.
[00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:56.160]   It's been a game.
[00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:56.160]   It's been a game.
[00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:57.120]   You keep a partnership.
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:59.760]   Yeah, well, Cannon tried to buy the partnership out,
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:03.520]   but the judge said, "Uh, uh, uh," don't think that fools us.
[00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:05.120]   This has been going on for a few years,
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:08.720]   and this just is a way to avoid the issue.
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:09.760]   And that's not going to count.
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:12.160]   So we shall see what happens.
[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:13.760]   But damages need to be determined.
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:17.600]   And Cannon would have to negotiate a new agreement.
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:18.000]   Amages.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.440]   They'd already sold one.
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:19.760]   I know.
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:22.000]   That's actually the funny part is like the technology
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.120]   was already having issues.
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:24.640]   Yeah, what happened to the next big thing?
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:26.560]   Oh, well.
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:27.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:28.800]   How many builds are prototype?
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:29.760]   And there's damages.
[00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:30.640]   Give me a break.
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:31.120]   Okay.
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:32.800]   This is, again, this whole patent thing.
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:33.680]   It's just completely--
[00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:34.480]   Well, they have no--
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:35.280]   Here's the deal.
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:38.400]   They paid a license fee to nano proprietary at $15 million.
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:39.840]   They breached the license deal.
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:41.200]   I mean, it's a pure contract law.
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:42.000]   What's the breach?
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:45.120]   Because they weren't supposed to share the information
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:45.760]   with another company.
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:48.320]   They did a joint venture with Toshiba.
[00:46:48.320 --> 00:46:50.320]   That's where the lawsuit began.
[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:51.600]   They said, "You know, last year--"
[00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:52.480]   Oh, well, never mind.
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:53.520]   Toshiba's not involved anymore.
[00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:54.640]   We bought out their half,
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:46:56.640]   and the judge said, "Hey, that doesn't fool anybody."
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:58.480]   And he furthermore said,
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:00.880]   "And the damages aren't going to be the 15 million
[00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:02.240]   that you paid the license fee."
[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:06.320]   Because frankly, that wouldn't be a disincentive.
[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:07.920]   So there were some serious damages on it.
[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:11.120]   It's also kind of funny, though, that they waited this long.
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:13.600]   They waited, basically, until the technology
[00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:14.800]   was going to fall behind--
[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:15.600]   Yeah, then they said--
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:17.440]   LC, they basically fall behind
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:19.200]   and never become a major player.
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:21.360]   Because the agreement with Toshiba goes back to,
[00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:24.320]   like, I think the nano proprietary did the agreement 99,
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:27.840]   and Toshiba started in how long ago with Canon on this?
[00:47:27.840 --> 00:47:30.240]   I mean, it's 2001, I think.
[00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:30.960]   I'm like, yeah.
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:32.080]   Yeah, so it's not like, you know,
[00:47:32.080 --> 00:47:33.600]   I think nano proprietary realized
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:36.000]   they weren't going to make a lot of money on this.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   So our friend--
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.800]   It's an interesting angle I never thought of.
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:41.760]   That's probably true.
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:43.200]   Yeah, well, it's me think about it.
[00:47:43.200 --> 00:47:45.680]   I mean, you know, leveraging patents and lawsuits
[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:48.000]   is becoming a completely acceptable way to,
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:49.840]   make money these days.
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:53.920]   You know, unfortunately, it seems to be crushing some companies,
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:56.560]   but they're doing it indiscriminately.
[00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:58.880]   Well, we have a lot of scope.
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:02.160]   We've had a number of patent lawsuits in the show alone.
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:04.400]   Another list for you, John.
[00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:07.440]   I know how much you love these lists put together by magazines.
[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:09.200]   That, you know, they're sitting around in a room,
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:10.240]   business 2.0, yeah.
[00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:10.800]   Slowly I turn.
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:13.920]   Yeah, I just love the drive and craze with this.
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:16.160]   25 startups to watch.
[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:17.440]   No.
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:18.960]   Business 2.0 magazine.
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:23.440]   Number nine on the list, which I think is a very prestigious
[00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:24.560]   number, revision three.
[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:28.400]   Our friend Kevin Rose's company that produces
[00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:30.640]   dignity and the number of other TV shows.
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:34.320]   I hate how these websites have this laid out.
[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:36.160]   I have to click each one to go on this one.
[00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:37.360]   It's like the slideshow.
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:38.320]   It's a pain.
[00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:39.120]   Oh, Mibo.
[00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:39.760]   I like Mibo.
[00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:40.240]   Mibo's good.
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:41.200]   Juice is on the list.
[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:43.200]   Wakia.
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:47.440]   Wakia, which is, of course, the for-profit version of Wikipedia
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:49.280]   that Jimmy Wales started.
[00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:49.680]   Dabble.
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:51.200]   I still don't understand what Dabble does.
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:54.240]   It's got a really cool logo.
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:54.880]   Yeah, it does.
[00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:58.800]   Which looks like the loser symbol that people do there.
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:00.240]   Forehead, but okay.
[00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:02.000]   So where is this on the list here?
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:02.880]   Oh, man.
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:04.320]   You just got to read the list, dude.
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:04.960]   It's all there.
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:07.040]   You don't do things in order anymore.
[00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:07.920]   Just bounce around.
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:08.960]   Oh, I never did a video.
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:08.960]   Here it is.
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:09.920]   25 startups to watch.
[00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:12.320]   I don't have any messages because I can probably complain about it.
[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:13.280]   Yeah, let's start with number.
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:14.000]   I'll just read them off.
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.600]   Number one, stumble upon.
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:16.160]   I like that.
[00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:17.680]   I liked that two years ago.
[00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:18.160]   Yeah.
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:20.480]   It's kind of not stumble upon Vex's me.
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:21.840]   Why do that?
[00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:22.720]   Vex's.
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:23.520]   I like that word.
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:26.320]   I enjoy the fact that there are visitors like things on my site,
[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:29.440]   but it Vex's me that I have to be using Firefox
[00:49:29.840 --> 00:49:31.360]   to see what the hell it is that they're saying.
[00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:32.000]   Is it like Alexa?
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:32.880]   I don't like them anymore.
[00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:33.440]   I just stopped.
[00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:34.320]   You kind of stopped using it.
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:37.040]   Is it like Alexa where it's like an add-on or your browser
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:38.080]   you don't really care about?
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:40.000]   Well, it's in some ways it seems pretty cool.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.240]   I haven't spent a lot of time on it because I'm a Safari user
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:44.560]   and this requires that you have, I don't think it works.
[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:46.880]   It's a Firefox extension, right?
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:47.200]   Yeah.
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:50.160]   And so if you can't really see what the conversation is at all,
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:52.400]   to my understanding, unless you're logged in.
[00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:55.360]   But anyway, no, but it seems to be really popular.
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:58.320]   It has a community aspect to it.
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:00.080]   I would say even more said than something like Dick,
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:02.560]   I mean, you've got icons with faces and that you really,
[00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:04.800]   I think do get more of a sense of like following your friends.
[00:50:04.800 --> 00:50:07.680]   I'm not, you know, I'm looking at this and the giveaway
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:10.400]   here on this article is, you know, this again, you know,
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:13.200]   like I'll say it to the public out there listening to this podcast.
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:14.240]   I've been at these meetings.
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:17.920]   You do magazines, look for some top 10, top 20 list to do.
[00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:21.040]   They sit around over donuts and dream this stuff up
[00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:22.800]   just to annoy readers like me.
[00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:23.680]   Anyway, it works.
[00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:26.880]   And throughout and throughout any company that had a seraph in its logo,
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:27.840]   from what I can tell.
[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:30.240]   Tell us all these roundy faces.
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:31.760]   That's because they're from 2001.
[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:33.920]   It's old stuff.
[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:36.160]   But anyway, it says that the bottom of the article.
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:39.680]   Tell us what you think of think about stumble upon model.
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:41.520]   Is it the next my space?
[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:43.200]   No, my space.
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:44.880]   The most close.
[00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:45.920]   What's the business?
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:49.440]   I don't even know what the business model is.
[00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:52.480]   You got to ask almost every one of these, what's the business model?
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:55.520]   I mean, now here's one that's that's pretty successful.
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:59.280]   San Francisco company I had never heard of until it made it to number one
[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:03.120]   in the Google Zeitgeist as the most searched for term in 2006.
[00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:03.920]   It's Bebo.
[00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:05.600]   Yeah, Bebo.
[00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:06.640]   Which number is that?
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:08.320]   Number three, Bebo.
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:10.480]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:11.360]   Number two, slide.
[00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:12.480]   You want to talk about slide?
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:13.120]   Well, I don't know.
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:14.000]   I don't know what it is.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.040]   What is it?
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:17.440]   They make online slides shows that you can embed.
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:18.320]   All right, right, right.
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:19.600]   There's a couple of those out there now.
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:20.720]   Well, there's one less.
[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:22.240]   You heard what happened with the film loop.
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:23.520]   No.
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:24.960]   I can't keep the story of that.
[00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:25.760]   That is.
[00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:31.600]   Their venture capital company basically sold them off to another company in their portfolio.
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:33.840]   No, that's happened before.
[00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:34.480]   For that, what was that?
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:38.320]   That was my exciting and at home.
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:40.800]   Did a crazy deal like that years ago?
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:41.920]   You know, there's a good article.
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:44.160]   Michael Arrington really goes off on them on TechCrunch.
[00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:48.400]   You should read about it because I have to say it's one of those.
[00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:52.000]   It's a good cautionary tale for anybody who's thinking of taking venture funding.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:52.800]   Let's put it that way.
[00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:55.920]   So film loops gone, slides still around.
[00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:56.480]   I don't know.
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:57.760]   Advertising?
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:59.920]   Well, back to Bebo.
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:00.320]   Bebo?
[00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:03.520]   Now they got a picture of the two people there on the Bebo thing.
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:06.400]   And the girls got it like a six o'clock shadow.
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:07.040]   The short term.
[00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:08.400]   Oh, come on, man.
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:09.200]   What?
[00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:09.920]   He doesn't.
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:12.160]   It doesn't lie.
[00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:14.000]   Wait, you're talking about the dude on the left?
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:15.200]   A JPEG artifact.
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:16.560]   Oh, that's the guy.
[00:52:16.560 --> 00:52:17.440]   Oh, okay, I'm sorry.
[00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:18.480]   The woman's on the right.
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:19.760]   Get off my lawn, you kids.
[00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:21.360]   Oh my gosh.
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:23.600]   And what kind of name is Zoshi?
[00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:24.720]   All right, so.
[00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:25.440]   Who cares?
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:28.400]   No, just say it's a lovely name.
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:28.960]   It's a grove.
[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:30.080]   This week in ad hominem.
[00:52:30.080 --> 00:52:31.120]   Exactly.
[00:52:31.120 --> 00:52:31.520]   There you go.
[00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:34.160]   Hey, what else is there to do on this network?
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:36.000]   Yeah, that's all we do is ad hominem.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.640]   So anyway, Molly Wood is saying that Bebo is going to be the next big thing.
[00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:40.640]   That's one of her predictions for this year.
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:44.000]   Like five million members of private cell now.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:49.200]   It is the next now this legitimately is the next Myspace.
[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:51.280]   And by the way, they are profitable right now.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:52.880]   Oh, not bad.
[00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:54.640]   It's I mean, one thing that's funny to watch about this.
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:57.040]   I remember the very first one of these that I remember was Friendster.
[00:52:57.040 --> 00:52:58.800]   And actually I got introduced to it.
[00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:03.440]   I think of the time was Heather Champ invited me and all of a sudden everybody was on Friendster.
[00:53:03.440 --> 00:53:05.120]   And it was Friendster, Friendster, Friendster, Friendster.
[00:53:05.120 --> 00:53:07.360]   And then like all of a sudden now to know that it was like it was a work on.
[00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:08.560]   The great Exodus.
[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:10.560]   The Exodus of like 2000.
[00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:11.760]   Why are you still on Friendster?
[00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:14.560]   You've got to get, I was 2002, three, something like that.
[00:53:14.560 --> 00:53:14.960]   Yeah.
[00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:16.240]   It's really, oh no, you got to get an orcut.
[00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:17.280]   You got to get an orcut.
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:21.120]   And it's just seems like people and now so I was talking to my, my wife's nephew.
[00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:23.360]   I was like, yeah, you know, he's whatever 16.
[00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:24.400]   Yeah, you into the MySpace.
[00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:26.480]   He's like, oh no, they're all leaving my daughter.
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:27.520]   He's a Facebook.
[00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:28.480]   Facebook now.
[00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:32.720]   So I mean, I guess my question to you guys, is this something where people are just,
[00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:35.680]   and you know, then you get into the whole phenomenon of like people changing their screen names
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:36.800]   all the time on all these things.
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:39.440]   Is this something that people are just constantly moving from one to the other?
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:42.320]   I have to buy that before before I comment that I will say,
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:46.720]   having already insulted the owners, that this is actually pretty slick.
[00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:48.160]   Oh, thank you, John.
[00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:50.400]   Welcome to the, welcome to the social.
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:51.440]   You should set them around their job.
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:55.360]   No, it is a very interesting phenomenon how people jump from one social network to another
[00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:57.360]   and all their friends do at the same time too.
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:53:58.800]   I don't know because I did the same thing.
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:54:00.640]   I was on like the features are that different.
[00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:01.760]   You know, you have paced in some,
[00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:03.520]   you have to make your page look good.
[00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:04.080]   You know what?
[00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:08.320]   It's exactly, it's always happened, but it's now doing it online.
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:12.400]   What shoes do you wear, what clothes do you wear, what's the hip, you know, pause.
[00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:13.440]   It's whatever trendy.
[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:14.560]   Yeah, whatever's trendy.
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:18.160]   And the whole idea of social, and this is something very, another good lesson for
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:20.080]   people who create these social networks.
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:22.880]   There's no point in being there if everybody else is in there.
[00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:26.560]   And it's very, I think it's very fickle.
[00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:27.920]   So it is totally fickle.
[00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:29.120]   I think it's an issue with it.
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:29.920]   It has to be addressed.
[00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:34.640]   But what I find weird is that you go to the next startup from Bibo and you get to Mibo.
[00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:35.760]   Mibo is awesome.
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:37.760]   Mibo is a really great startup.
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:40.640]   Mibo, Mibo, Mibo, Mibo, Mibo, Mibo.
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:43.680]   John, we need to do a startup.
[00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:44.880]   We're going to center everything.
[00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:46.240]   We're going to take all the vowels out.
[00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:46.720]   We'll call it.
[00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:47.120]   Now you're talking.
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:47.280]   We'll call it.
[00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:49.200]   No, Mibo is actually really handy.
[00:54:49.200 --> 00:54:50.800]   I've used Mibo quite a bit, actually.
[00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:51.920]   I'm kind of biased.
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:52.880]   It's a chat.
[00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:54.480]   I have a client who put on your website.
[00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:56.800]   It's an Ajax chat platform.
[00:54:56.800 --> 00:55:01.120]   And so basically you can log into any one of your IM names, like AIM or Yahoo or an
[00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:02.720]   ICQ, anything like that.
[00:55:02.720 --> 00:55:04.880]   And it's all in Ajax and your web browser.
[00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:07.200]   And you can move all the windows around wherever you want to.
[00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:11.440]   And you can use it in places that would normally ban any kind of chat client.
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:15.760]   So if you're at a library or if you're at school, you can probably use Mibo.
[00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:18.080]   You can get around the ports and that kind of thing.
[00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:21.200]   That's really interesting because I mean, like for example, my wife can't look at
[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:22.800]   stuff like YouTube at work.
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:26.000]   Like Flash is just shut off across our entire location.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   It's interesting to think about the company that might make its whole
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:31.760]   operation based on routing around things like blocking.
[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:33.200]   Do you use Mibo on your site?
[00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:34.720]   I mean, where do you use Mibo?
[00:55:34.720 --> 00:55:35.760]   Where do I personally use it?
[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:37.840]   I've used it a couple times when I've been out and about and
[00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:41.440]   haven't wanted to install like AIM on the computer that I was using at the time.
[00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:43.360]   It's good if you're actually in an office house.
[00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:47.200]   Because the idea is that I as a blog publisher would put it on my--
[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:50.960]   Well, there is also a widget, I believe, that you can install on your website
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:54.320]   and people can see when you're chatting and chat with users on your website.
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:55.040]   Isn't that their model?
[00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:56.000]   That was the whole idea of it.
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:59.280]   I don't know if that's what their model was initially going to be.
[00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:00.320]   It might have been.
[00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:04.480]   I remember that they changed their model a little bit from when they first started.
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:06.320]   I thought about it and then I thought, "Well, why do I want--?"
[00:56:06.320 --> 00:56:10.160]   Just what I need to have people come to my website and bug me.
[00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:12.640]   I mean, that's why I didn't install it either.
[00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:15.600]   Well, Leo doesn't even answer his email.
[00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:16.880]   So I'm not taking him.
[00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:17.520]   I stopped answering email.
[00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:18.720]   I don't even give you a nice address anymore.
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:20.320]   Yeah, he said he said something possible to get ahold of him.
[00:56:20.320 --> 00:56:22.480]   Now, we go to the next one, which is wikia.com.
[00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:23.280]   Any comments on that?
[00:56:23.280 --> 00:56:24.960]   Just seems like another one of these will happen.
[00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:26.480]   Well, here's the deal.
[00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:28.240]   Jimmy Wales started Wikipedia.
[00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:30.640]   He's always insisted on keeping a commercial free.
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:34.080]   He-- Wikia is basically a way to monetize.
[00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:37.360]   It's a business that he created based on the Wikia platform.
[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:38.640]   And actually, there's some very cool stuff.
[00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:40.640]   We did an interview with him a couple of weeks ago on Net at night.
[00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:41.120]   All right.
[00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:42.640]   Well, we'll give that one an OK.
[00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:43.200]   Let me go--
[00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:43.520]   Interesting.
[00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:44.640]   Well, let me just say one thing.
[00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:45.440]   I mean, the interesting thing--
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:46.000]   I'm going to move through these things.
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:46.400]   I understand.
[00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:49.840]   But that's not our way, John.
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:53.520]   The interesting thing about it is that he has consistently
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:54.120]   refused.
[00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:55.880]   A number of people have said, why don't you
[00:56:55.880 --> 00:56:59.600]   allow advertising on Wikipedia?
[00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:01.920]   Jason Calicanos, the chief among these, said, hey,
[00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:03.280]   you could monetize.
[00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:04.960]   You wouldn't have to beg for money anymore.
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:07.160]   You could make millions on Wikipedia.
[00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:09.440]   Just put some banner ads on there.
[00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:10.240]   How do you feel about that?
[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:11.760]   Should Wikipedia have ads?
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:13.720]   I don't think Wikipedia should have ads.
[00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:14.240]   I agree with you.
[00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:15.240]   I agree.
[00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:15.760]   Yeah.
[00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:17.120]   And Jimmy's very clear about that.
[00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:20.320]   I'm happy that he has stood by that.
[00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:22.040]   But he has to make money like anybody else,
[00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:23.520]   so he's got Wikia.
[00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:24.240]   It's interesting.
[00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:25.560]   It's a very interesting idea.
[00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:28.840]   Well, it kind of reminds me a lot of metro blogging, even.
[00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:32.200]   But more, you can do it yourself if you're not
[00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:33.000]   one of the editors.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.320]   You can just edit your own information
[00:57:34.320 --> 00:57:35.480]   about whatever city that you're in.
[00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:36.520]   Really interesting.
[00:57:36.520 --> 00:57:37.600]   Wikia-- well, it's not just cities.
[00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:38.920]   Do they start the San Francisco one year?
[00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:41.040]   Because the first time I went there, there was nothing on there.
[00:57:41.040 --> 00:57:42.040]   But it's not--
[00:57:42.040 --> 00:57:44.880]   He's asking what his favorite Wikia blog is.
[00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:48.120]   And I think it's one on the Muppets.
[00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:50.640]   It's a Muppet Wiki media.
[00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:52.760]   Everything Muppet.
[00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:53.320]   Really?
[00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:54.400]   Oh, it's amazing.
[00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:56.880]   Yeah, I think it's Muppets.wikia.com.
[00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:57.440]   But I'm not sure.
[00:57:57.440 --> 00:57:58.840]   I'll have to find the link for this.
[00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:01.120]   My best friend called me today and was like, can you tell me,
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:02.560]   can you explain to me what a Wiki is?
[00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:05.120]   My boss just asked me, and I don't know what that is.
[00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:06.240]   And I was like, oh, man.
[00:58:06.240 --> 00:58:07.440]   I think there's still room for companies.
[00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:09.720]   Like, Leo, we were talking about on Macbreak weekly,
[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:13.520]   how we were having trouble getting this Ruby program set up
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:14.120]   to do the--
[00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:15.520]   Oh, there's a lot we wanted to do.
[00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:18.000]   I think there's still room for people to come out there
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:21.520]   and make it easy for people who aren't comfortable going in
[00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:24.000]   and installing whatever Drupal.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:25.040]   I think there's still a lot of room
[00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:28.160]   for people to have things like CMS systems or Wikis.
[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:30.720]   And to make it really easy to go out there and set this stuff up.
[00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:33.400]   And I mean, for small businesses and little groups of people,
[00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:35.560]   people trying to plan a reunion, I think stuff like that is--
[00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:37.560]   I think there's still going to be room for people to go out
[00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:38.720]   and make that stuff easy to set up.
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:40.880]   I want the big E-Vite killer.
[00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:41.480]   Oh, god.
[00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:42.160]   Upcoming.
[00:58:42.160 --> 00:58:42.680]   Upkill E-Vite.
[00:58:42.680 --> 00:58:43.640]   It's not the same.
[00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:44.240]   It's not the same.
[00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:44.800]   Why do you say?
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:46.000]   What is upcoming not--
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:47.880]   Is there-- I do use upcoming.
[00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:50.120]   Is there a function where you can send out an invitation
[00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:51.840]   to a group of people?
[00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:52.760]   Like E-Vite?
[00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:53.760]   Yeah.
[00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:54.480]   Mm-hmm.
[00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:55.560]   What?
[00:58:55.560 --> 00:58:57.200]   You can--
[00:58:57.200 --> 00:59:00.200]   Upcoming allows you to have private.
[00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:01.680]   No, he wants to do a mailing list.
[00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:02.680]   Yeah.
[00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:04.120]   I got an answer for you.
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:06.600]   There's one that Nile Kennedy sent me one time.
[00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:08.200]   Hey, all of these, because you have to--
[00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:12.440]   the fundamental premise of this is you give my email address
[00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:13.560]   to some site.
[00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:16.000]   I don't want you giving out my email address.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:17.000]   You know what difference is it?
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:17.400]   Make the wheel.
[00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:18.760]   You never answer email anyway.
[00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:19.240]   That's why.
[00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:20.440]   You know how much email I get?
[00:59:20.440 --> 00:59:21.080]   I meant to spam.
[00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:21.760]   Am I getting on that?
[00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:24.120]   Get as-- go and go where I go and get those spam.
[00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:25.680]   I know you get no spam.
[00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:26.680]   Here's--
[00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:27.200]   Here's--
[00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:30.000]   Let me just tell you a quick way of getting around the E-Vite
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:30.200]   thing.
[00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:32.240]   If you want to do it, mass invitations,
[00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:33.600]   you go to open table.
[00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:34.600]   I love open table.
[00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:35.240]   And you send--
[00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:36.160]   I don't know that one.
[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:37.600]   Oh, open table reservation.
[00:59:37.600 --> 00:59:39.200]   You make a reservation at a restaurant,
[00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:41.400]   then you write a long message, which is your invitation.
[00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:42.680]   You send it to all these different people,
[00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:44.200]   and then cancel the reservation.
[00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:46.640]   Meanwhile, they send out all these invites.
[00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:48.200]   I got a theory on E-Vite.
[00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:49.200]   I got a theory.
[00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:51.160]   You're so weird.
[00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:52.920]   So no, open table's-- you go in you--
[00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:54.320]   it's a reservation service.
[00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:55.280]   He's hacking into an--
[00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:57.440]   There's something called an email client.
[00:59:57.440 --> 00:59:59.720]   And see what you do is you take all these people's addresses,
[00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:02.560]   you put it in the two field, you type your message,
[01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:03.160]   you press send.
[01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:03.680]   It's amazing.
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:04.800]   It's too shame, Leo.
[01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:05.560]   Too shame.
[01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:07.480]   The 2.0 of that is the BCC field.
[01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:08.600]   I have a theory about E-Vite.
[01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:11.000]   I think it's about friends as trading cards.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.840]   I think people love sending out these invitations
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:13.720]   with a bunch of names.
[01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:15.720]   Because they like everyone to see who their friends are.
[01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:16.880]   It's so-- it's so tacky.
[01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:18.320]   I mean, I think people write back.
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:19.720]   They say, oh, I'll be there.
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:21.680]   I'm looking so forward to it.
[01:00:21.680 --> 01:00:22.640]   Well, that's what I can say.
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:23.760]   I always say, I hate you.
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:24.720]   I hate your party.
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:25.520]   Forget it.
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:27.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:28.600]   And you never get invited.
[01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:30.240]   I don't get many invites now.
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:31.600]   Juices is number six.
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:33.160]   We've already beat that one.
[01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:34.240]   Let's move on.
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:37.320]   Dabbel is the one that nobody understands what it does.
[01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:38.640]   But it's got a great Hank Barry.
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:41.160]   Put some money into it.
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:41.760]   It's a dabble.
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:43.320]   Must be really cool because they only
[01:00:43.320 --> 01:00:45.280]   got like $750,000.
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:45.760]   It's small.
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:48.560]   So it must be the most amazing technology on this list.
[01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:49.560]   Period.
[01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:50.680]   That's my theory now.
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:53.440]   The less money that's invested, the more obviously amazing.
[01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:54.160]   You're probably right.
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:56.000]   One founder, one CEO.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.480]   It's a tool for organizing videos
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:00.760]   into playlists of favorites.
[01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:02.000]   Wow, we need that tool.
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:02.560]   OK.
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:03.520]   Metacafe.
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:04.520]   What do you think of it?
[01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:05.520]   Wait, wait, wait.
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:07.200]   The dabble logo, by the way, is Loser.
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:08.200]   I know.
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:08.720]   John?
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:11.560]   No, the dabble logo is holding up your fingers
[01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:13.760]   as if you're framing a shot like a rocker.
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:14.320]   Oh, I got it.
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:14.640]   OK.
[01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:14.840]   Next.
[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:15.680]   It's also Loser.
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:16.800]   She whiz.
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:17.600]   Double Loser.
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:18.160]   Metacafe.
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:19.840]   Metacafe is pretty cool.
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:21.280]   What is it?
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:23.160]   It's basically a video site, right?
[01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:23.840]   It's like YouTube.
[01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:24.640]   Yeah, OK, next.
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:25.080]   Yeah.
[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:25.800]   It's another YouTube.
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:26.440]   It's a movie.
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:27.520]   We've heard of these guys.
[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:29.040]   You know, I just got to say something.
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:30.720]   Can I just say something?
[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:33.480]   Yeah, just say it's 25 startups to watch, right?
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:36.360]   They have one and a half million monthly viewers.
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:38.720]   We've got four times that number.
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:39.720]   OK, just say that.
[01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:40.280]   You're not a--
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:40.800]   Wait, yo.
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:41.320]   Wait, viewers?
[01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:43.480]   Wait, viewers or downloads?
[01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:44.280]   You're not a startup.
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:45.280]   You're not asking for--
[01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:47.080]   You don't have four and a half million viewers.
[01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:48.280]   All the money for yourself.
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:48.880]   That's a nice thing.
[01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:49.960]   Well, that's a question there.
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:51.920]   Are they talking about unique viewers or downloads?
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:55.040]   I almost guarantee you they're talking about downloads.
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:55.520]   No, yeah.
[01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:59.120]   The last thing I saw in this is one and a half million monthly,
[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:01.000]   one and a half million downloads.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:01.480]   I don't know.
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:02.000]   Yeah.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:02.840]   They say viewers.
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:04.280]   But it couldn't be unique viewers.
[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:06.920]   I think that's a mistake on the part of the magazine,
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:08.680]   because other stuff I've seen for revision three
[01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:09.920]   is one and a half million downloads.
[01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:10.640]   And that's what I'm saying.
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:12.360]   We have four times that number of downloads.
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:15.120]   OK, hey, everybody loves you.
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:16.000]   So let's go to the next--
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.480]   I should be on this list.
[01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:20.600]   And it's not me filing the video.
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:22.680]   Well, you haven't taken any venture capital, Leo.
[01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:22.960]   They're--
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:23.480]   Oh, that's right.
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:24.640]   I'm not a startup.
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:25.720]   Worth paying attention to you.
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:26.440]   He's not a startup.
[01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:27.960]   He's been trying to start for years.
[01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:29.200]   OK, lip TV.
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:30.440]   Let's see if he's great.
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:31.040]   Start down.
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:32.040]   I love lip TV.
[01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:33.040]   I did a nice--
[01:02:33.040 --> 01:02:34.520]   Well, I got to say something.
[01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:35.480]   What does blip TV do?
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:36.760]   Because the only time I've dealt with them
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:38.760]   is when one of their founders tried to shove them--
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:41.560]   I was doing a wrap on a shoot in New York
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:43.760]   with a bunch of people.
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:46.600]   And one of the founders shoved themselves
[01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:49.320]   into the camera shot so they could tell me how cool
[01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:50.440]   their company was.
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:52.560]   I think they're really nice people, so I'm making them bias.
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:53.080]   OK.
[01:02:53.080 --> 01:02:54.120]   Apparently this guy wasn't.
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:55.600]   I think it's a great service.
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:02:57.160]   It's much more flexible than YouTube
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:59.200]   for somebody who actually wants to have a video podcast.
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:00.040]   And they do use it.
[01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:01.960]   They help monetize it, too, don't they?
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:04.160]   Yeah, I have a advertising model.
[01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:06.480]   How's that different than Dave TV?
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:07.560]   I don't know.
[01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:10.560]   But on YouTube, if you just throw it up
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:12.880]   and you get that one in bed, I think what people may not know,
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:14.480]   with lip TV, when you put stuff up,
[01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:17.120]   you can basically put it up in any format you want
[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:19.560]   and then spit out whatever size code you want
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:20.720]   for putting it on your site.
[01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:21.760]   It's much more flexible.
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:22.960]   Yeah.
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:24.040]   Have you used it?
[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:26.040]   I don't use it personally, no, but I know a lot of video
[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:28.600]   podcasters that do and really enjoy the product.
[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:31.920]   Yeah, I think that this is what Calla uses on Geek Brief.
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:32.760]   Not the chicken.
[01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:33.840]   And yeah, and there is a model, though.
[01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:35.240]   I mean, I haven't used it yet.
[01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:36.200]   One thing that does seem kind of cool
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:38.000]   is you get to pick where you want your ad to go.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.800]   Do you want it to go pre-roll or was that what they say?
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:40.360]   Pre-roll.
[01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:40.680]   Oh, phone guys.
[01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:41.680]   Yeah, pre-roll and post-roll.
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:43.680]   I'm watching a phone guy on Blip TV.
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:45.080]   Yeah, phone guys on Blip TV.
[01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:47.040]   Oh, I'm sitting here looking at the Blip TV site
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:48.160]   and there you are, Merlin.
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:49.120]   Oh, really? It's on the thing?
[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:50.200]   Yeah, it's on the front page.
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:51.520]   They're collating you.
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:52.680]   You're a shell.
[01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:54.280]   You're paid to tell us this.
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:55.760]   No, he's an elish blogger.
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:56.760]   As we've been to--
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:03.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:04.320]   Use the code.
[01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:05.200]   You're number three.
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:07.040]   Click number three on the channels.
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:08.400]   The phone guy is number three on there.
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:09.120]   That's interesting.
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:10.080]   Let's go to the next one.
[01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:13.160]   Yeah, it's interesting how many of these on this list
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:15.760]   are basically YouTube-type sites.
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:16.280]   Very interesting.
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:16.960]   It's fun.
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:17.280]   Fun.
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:17.280]   Fun.
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:18.280]   Fun is really cool.
[01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:19.800]   Fun is another cool one.
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:20.360]   It's fun.
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:21.760]   It's Spanish.
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:22.600]   They're a Spanish company.
[01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:24.600]   It's Spanish for La Foneira, which is--
[01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:25.560]   I have questions.
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:29.800]   This is one of those interesting that I'm a little--
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:31.320]   I think it's a little sketch.
[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:34.040]   The idea is they have a wireless router that you buy.
[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:35.760]   Oh, I write, write, write, write, write.
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:36.280]   I know it's--
[01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:37.160]   I don't think it's sketchy at all.
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:38.600]   I think it's a really great idea.
[01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:40.880]   I'm in agreement with Rio on this one.
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:41.880]   I've used it.
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:44.680]   It's a neat idea, but getting the penetration
[01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:45.760]   needed to make it useful.
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:47.200]   Well, you know what they did is they gave away
[01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:49.760]   a bunch of free Fone routers.
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:52.520]   That's because they had $22 million in venture.
[01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:53.760]   Not bad.
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:55.160]   I mean, Google's funding them, wow.
[01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:56.000]   Yeah.
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.080]   Well, I don't know.
[01:04:57.080 --> 01:05:00.880]   I mean, having enjoyed the drop in rent prices
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:02.560]   after the first dot bomb, there's
[01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:03.760]   some of these companies where it's like,
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:05.200]   you look at the amount of money they're getting.
[01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:08.560]   It's a pretty amazing amount of seed capital, especially
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:10.800]   given the kind of turnaround on the investment
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:11.880]   that the VC companies want.
[01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:13.120]   Well, here's-- yeah.
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:14.360]   Sorry, I continue.
[01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:17.880]   Everybody's going toward EVDO and that other crap
[01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:18.680]   that the phone company is--
[01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:20.840]   Well, you know, but here, this is why it's a really good idea.
[01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:22.200]   If you have a Wi-Fi enabled phone,
[01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:23.880]   and you're running Skype on your Wi-Fi phone,
[01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:25.560]   and you're going around into a neighborhood that has
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:28.080]   a bunch of these phone routers set up,
[01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:30.760]   then you're basically getting your calls for free.
[01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.600]   Not much longer, according to this,
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:35.560]   they're in deal talks with US cellular service providers.
[01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:37.400]   So I can guarantee you the first thing
[01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:38.920]   that you're going to stop is that.
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:39.960]   Yeah.
[01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:41.600]   But this is not going to happen.
[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:45.040]   I mean, people have tried this with mesh networking.
[01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:47.160]   People have, you know, open source mesh network.
[01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:48.520]   It's basically-- it's basically--
[01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:49.680]   It's basically-- yeah.
[01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:50.880]   It's a little bit mesh.
[01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:52.520]   It's like, you're going to sign up,
[01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:54.880]   and then you're going to get this $30 router,
[01:05:54.880 --> 01:05:57.480]   and register your node, and share your broad--
[01:05:57.480 --> 01:05:59.320]   It instantly file your terms of service.
[01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:00.440]   I have a-- I have a--
[01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:00.960]   Right.
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:01.480]   A-- right.
[01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:03.760]   --a fun, hot spot right at my house.
[01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:05.040]   I get full service with the hot--
[01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:05.560]   That's why you like it.
[01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:07.200]   No, I've never used it before.
[01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:08.120]   I've never actually used it.
[01:06:08.120 --> 01:06:10.000]   I'm interested in trying it, but--
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.400]   As far as your terms of service, at least with most service
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:13.440]   providers in the US--
[01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:14.480]   Cool.
[01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:16.200]   --now with this good 200 gigabyte cap,
[01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:17.320]   we're seeing a Comcast.
[01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:18.400]   You've got to wonder how many people
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:19.640]   are going to be doing this kind of stuff.
[01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:21.720]   Hey, see, I just, you know, leave my router open
[01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:22.720]   and share it with the world.
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:23.720]   Aren't you nice?
[01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:25.120]   Do you really?
[01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:27.520]   Do you-- do you-- I do share a--
[01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:30.360]   Yeah, actually, I do leave a segment of my router open,
[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:34.320]   because, hey, I use open routers all over the country.
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:35.320]   True.
[01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:38.040]   Do you do like a captive portal, or you just leave it open?
[01:06:38.040 --> 01:06:40.840]   I basically do-- I basically have a segmented section
[01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:45.800]   that's open, because I've used people's open Wi-Fi routers
[01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:47.560]   all over the country, because they're kind enough
[01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:48.320]   to share it with me.
[01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:50.120]   I think that's nice to get back.
[01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:53.560]   That is-- I don't need to buy a $30 router to share my Wi-Fi
[01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:56.840]   with somebody, I guess, is part of what I don't get about phone.
[01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:58.480]   All right, I don't know this next one at all.
[01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:01.240]   Looped, L-O-O-P-T. It's--
[01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:02.080]   Like, sounds like Twitter.
[01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:04.120]   It's around-the-clock friend tracking.
[01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:07.040]   Cell phone customers are using Loop to let their buddies
[01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:07.680]   see the locations.
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:09.120]   Oh, so like, dodgeball, kind of.
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:10.080]   Is it GPS?
[01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:10.440]   What is it?
[01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:12.960]   Or what's the other one that begins with a G, or Geezer,
[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:13.480]   or whatever?
[01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:14.840]   There's a lot of these.
[01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:15.400]   It's pretty big.
[01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:15.840]   People who--
[01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:16.680]   Because stock are--
[01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:18.520]   Boost mobile subscribers.
[01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:19.840]   Mm, OK.
[01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:20.340]   One.
[01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:22.640]   Well, you know, the Helio phones are doing that, too.
[01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:24.360]   A couple of the Helio phones have GPS enabled.
[01:07:24.360 --> 01:07:24.840]   Do you really want--
[01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:25.600]   Which is a little bit different.
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:26.600]   Do you really want a lot of people who
[01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:27.880]   have turned off dodgeball?
[01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:28.380]   Yeah.
[01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:30.000]   I don't use dodgeball at all anymore.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.880]   It's the same thing, places that kind of freaks me.
[01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:33.240]   I don't want people to know where I am.
[01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:34.200]   Well, you know, that's not show.
[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:36.400]   I actually have used it recently.
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:37.560]   Mobio.
[01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:38.120]   But did you just--
[01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:39.800]   Mobile phone mashups and widgets
[01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:41.160]   that figure out where you are.
[01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:42.680]   It sounds like the last one.
[01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:43.760]   Yeah, you know what?
[01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:45.640]   This is for Stalkers, this stuff.
[01:07:45.640 --> 01:07:46.800]   Yeah.
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:47.680]   Well, the Stalkys.
[01:07:47.680 --> 01:07:48.880]   This one's the other way around.
[01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:50.960]   It knows where you are so that you can book a cab
[01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:51.760]   or get a seat at a restaurant.
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:53.120]   It was the first Stalkys.
[01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:54.600]   Well, because you want to be stalked.
[01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:55.680]   Right, you have to enable this.
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:56.600]   And we're going to be stalked.
[01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:57.560]   Stalk me big one.
[01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:58.880]   Yeah.
[01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:00.880]   But I mean, for a lot of people, that's like, you know,
[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:01.600]   where's the party?
[01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:02.360]   Where people are actually--
[01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:03.600]   I may have actually heard everybody's doing.
[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:04.480]   That's much what it's good.
[01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:06.880]   You can tell as much information as you want it to.
[01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:08.120]   Twitter's plenty.
[01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:08.960]   I like Twitter.
[01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:11.080]   You know, I may have had a meeting with these guys.
[01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:12.960]   I was dubious about this.
[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:14.800]   I mean, it's like, you know, well, you can get a cab.
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:15.960]   You can get a reservation.
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:17.360]   We're talking about mobile--
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:19.320]   How about walking in and getting a reservation?
[01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:20.760]   How about, you know, you're tailing a cab?
[01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:21.720]   Open table, John.
[01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:22.520]   Open table.
[01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:23.040]   Oh, I know.
[01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:24.880]   I'm saying, if you're roaming around on the street
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:26.480]   and you want to get something to eat, you know,
[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:27.200]   there's restaurants.
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:28.880]   Go walk into one of the cities of menus.
[01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:29.440]   No, no, no.
[01:08:29.440 --> 01:08:33.000]   I'd much rather be on my phone and push a button.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:35.400]   How about this one that's called "Tiny" in parentheses?
[01:08:35.400 --> 01:08:36.480]   I love the logo.
[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:38.080]   I mean, just a little tiny logo.
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:39.320]   No, that's insulting, it seems.
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:41.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:43.080]   It's not intended for you.
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:43.560]   It's not--
[01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:45.760]   He thinks the pundit dumpt for testing much.
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:47.320]   Not me.
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:50.640]   "Tiny's radar service lets you snap photos with cell phones
[01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:54.320]   and send them to friends again who can both access and comment
[01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:55.680]   on the shots.
[01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:58.160]   It will be a built-in application on the new sidekicks."
[01:08:58.160 --> 01:08:59.720]   Mm.
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:00.560]   I don't know.
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:01.560]   I don't know.
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:02.320]   I don't really care.
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:03.440]   That's got nothing.
[01:09:03.440 --> 01:09:06.560]   No, what you're seeing a lot of these cell phone-based services,
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:08.600]   though, is there's a very clear revenue model.
[01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:11.000]   I mean, that's why you're seeing all these different places.
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.120]   Now, here's one from Oklahoma coming up sooner.
[01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:14.120]   I'm a sonar.
[01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:14.600]   Oh, come on.
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:15.840]   Vowels are your friends.
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:18.800]   Let's stop it with the E dropping here.
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:20.080]   Yes, O and R.
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:21.760]   How they could go with the E without--
[01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:22.920]   You know, they saw what's--
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:25.000]   What's flicker with the guys who started this trend?
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:25.480]   Yeah.
[01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:25.920]   Yeah.
[01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:26.840]   I mean, this is like the trend.
[01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:28.040]   Remember the trend in the late '90s,
[01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:30.840]   where you always have a capital letter right in the middle of a low--
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:33.320]   Intercap Q.
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:38.600]   Merlin, didn't you tell me that Ev was going to make Twitter TWTTR?
[01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:42.000]   I think initially, the first one I saw was this really ghastly-looking--
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.240]   I look like a, I don't know, like a peremecium, a big greasy peremecium.
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:49.240]   But it said Twitter in super, super roundy letters.
[01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:51.120]   And it looked like it was like bleeding--
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:51.960]   You know what's interesting?
[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:53.920]   We talked about Twitter a number of times.
[01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:56.720]   I don't get why Twitter is so popular, but it is.
[01:09:56.720 --> 01:09:57.240]   I love it.
[01:09:57.240 --> 01:09:58.600]   I use it.
[01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:03.920]   In fact, it's so successful, apparently, that Ev is planning to sell obvious,
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:05.120]   obviously, and focus on--
[01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:05.840]   And focus on Twitter.
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:06.240]   --sell audio.
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:06.840]   Cell audio.
[01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:07.240]   I'm sorry.
[01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:07.520]   Yeah, that's the--
[01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:08.400]   --their companies.
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:09.080]   I'm sorry.
[01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:13.360]   Obviously, who wants to sell audio and focus on Twitter, which is bizarre.
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:16.320]   You'd think audio had much better business plan than obvious than--
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:17.320]   Well, but he's--
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:21.400]   --audio's in competition with how many other podcasting operations--
[01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:23.960]   --including I might add your very own--
[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:24.960]   --on audio.
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:26.040]   And I supported audio.
[01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:26.320]   And we--
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:28.760]   Yeah, but they're, like, third competition with PodShow,
[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:31.040]   who's got, like, 20 million, 5 million sitting in the bank,
[01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:33.160]   and how many other systems are feeding podcasts.
[01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:34.360]   They should be named odious.
[01:10:34.360 --> 01:10:36.240]   So we didn't even say what sooner does.
[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:39.000]   What sooner actually-- I just downloaded the install for sooner.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.240]   I'm so curious about it.
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:41.240]   Really?
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:42.680]   Yeah, that was fast.
[01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:43.680]   I was going to--
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:43.680]   I was going to--
[01:10:43.680 --> 01:10:46.320]   --use your phone to pull up and search data on your desktop.
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:48.240]   Everything from Word doc to Photoshop files.
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:49.280]   I don't get it.
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:50.160]   Get a smartphone.
[01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:50.840]   Moving on.
[01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:52.360]   Well, why would I search my desktop?
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:53.080]   Well, no, actually--
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:54.200]   --phone.
[01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:55.320]   Actually, like they do--
[01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:56.560]   I don't-- well, anyhow.
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:58.040]   I like Snap Judgment, so let's keep going.
[01:10:58.040 --> 01:10:58.640]   Try it, John.
[01:10:58.640 --> 01:11:00.280]   Yeah, this is really easier with 25.
[01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:01.200]   We've got to.
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:02.640]   But try it, Patrick, and let us know.
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:03.280]   OK.
[01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:04.320]   Turn.com.
[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:05.880]   You guys don't care if it works.
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:07.840]   You've had your Snap Judgment move on.
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:10.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:11:10.640 --> 01:11:11.000]   Now, this--
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.000]   I don't like that logo.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.440]   I'm never going to make any money.
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:14.840]   Turn has an interesting logo.
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:16.840]   It's a little origami kind of a Escher--
[01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:17.200]   Oh, it's--
[01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:17.200]   --it's--
[01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:18.600]   --it's their blurb is very long.
[01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:19.840]   It looks cheap.
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:20.920]   It does look cheesy.
[01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:21.960]   But it is trademarks.
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:23.600]   One of the few that's trademarked on this list.
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:24.040]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:24.040 --> 01:11:25.080]   Heaven forbid.
[01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:25.920]   Well, that's because it's--
[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:28.480]   You know, it sounds a lot like AdSense without Google's
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:31.600]   gigantic distribution and market data.
[01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:34.320]   Next, Adify.
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:36.200]   Online marketplace for highly targeted ads.
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:38.720]   We have the same kind of blocky thing.
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:39.320]   What's up with that?
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:41.080]   It's the same business model.
[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:44.000]   AdMob offers a place to buy ads for delivery of cell phones.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:44.840]   Wait a minute.
[01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:46.040]   Are we in the ad section?
[01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:47.160]   Spotrunner.
[01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:49.720]   Spotrunner definitely has the best logo.
[01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:50.360]   Oh, doggy.
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:52.200]   A little Dalmatian running.
[01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:53.360]   Wait, which way are you working?
[01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:54.280]   I skipped ahead like three.
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:55.280]   I'm on 19.
[01:11:55.280 --> 01:11:56.480]   What about AdMob?
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:57.400]   You missed another one.
[01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:58.600]   No, I mentioned AdMob.
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:11:59.520]   And then I moved down.
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:00.040]   OK.
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:02.880]   And that spotrunner is 30 second TV ads though.
[01:12:02.880 --> 01:12:03.880]   Yeah.
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:05.240]   Is that what 60 billion Amazon is?
[01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:06.600]   I'm a guy in the right there.
[01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:07.520]   Oh, interesting.
[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:09.960]   Local businesses can browse a library of pre-made spots
[01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:12.360]   and personalize them for airing in their local market.
[01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:14.000]   Yeah, this isn't an internet play at all.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.080]   I don't even know why they're mentioning this in terms of--
[01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:17.760]   I think because they sell them online.
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:18.800]   They sell them online.
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:21.040]   Yeah, but it's for air on TV.
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:21.360]   Wait, wait.
[01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:23.360]   I'm having this great mental image of--
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:26.080]   you can come down to insert name of--
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:27.760]   or insert name of shop.
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:28.840]   And buy insert--
[01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:30.720]   But in a different voice.
[01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:34.440]   Like welcome to Bob's discount furniture.
[01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:36.480]   Bob's discount furniture is the best deals available
[01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:39.680]   in America on furniture because you can buy it today.
[01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:40.560]   Yeah, so far--
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:41.480]   Fitchbark.
[01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:45.360]   In radio for years that we had these pre-made ads
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:46.680]   for a variety of businesses.
[01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:48.520]   And you just take the person's name in it.
[01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:49.560]   But it's got the jingle.
[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:53.000]   You'll find great refrigerators here and stuff like that.
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.320]   Well, Leo, another thing that you radio--
[01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:56.920]   I think there's less of it than there used to be.
[01:12:56.920 --> 01:13:01.560]   They used to send out these disks of a pre-interview.
[01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:03.960]   And you'd have some celebrity answering questions
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:05.680]   that you would read from a sheet of paper.
[01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:06.200]   You bet.
[01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:07.200]   And you run the whole thing.
[01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:09.360]   And then some clowns decided to change
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:11.280]   the format or they started using--
[01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:13.600]   make it up different questions.
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:16.080]   And it was like, that was the end of that.
[01:13:16.080 --> 01:13:17.280]   So sorry.
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:18.160]   I can just imagine.
[01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:18.920]   What fun.
[01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:20.080]   That would be really fun.
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:22.440]   Well, I mean, it's kind of like the TV show that had that
[01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:25.440]   Batman and the white ghost, whatever it was--
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:26.120]   Space ghost.
[01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:26.600]   Space ghost.
[01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:27.440]   Space ghost.
[01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:30.560]   It was basically interviews with the questions
[01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:32.000]   that had nothing to do with the answers.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:32.840]   And it was actually--
[01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:33.720]   Well, it goes back to the '50s.
[01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:34.720]   Remember those mashups?
[01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:35.560]   Lots of non-suckers.
[01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:38.080]   The early mashups where they would take--
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:39.160]   Hey, Mr. Space Mask.
[01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:40.760]   They're not ad libs.
[01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:41.620]   That would be another one.
[01:13:41.620 --> 01:13:43.240]   Now these were records.
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:44.440]   V-True.
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:47.000]   V-True's platform lets corporate customers
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:50.000]   solicit, edit, and upload user-generated videos that
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.280]   promote their products.
[01:13:51.280 --> 01:13:53.200]   Blah.
[01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:55.480]   Well, that's what happened on the Super Bowl.
[01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:57.760]   Was it weren't the best ads on the Super Bowl ones
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:13:58.680]   that were created by--
[01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:00.320]   Remember what happened when GM allowed
[01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:03.160]   people to make user-generated ads for them?
[01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:04.920]   That did not turn out well.
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:05.720]   It didn't-- it's OK.
[01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:08.160]   When you get a chance to dig through the Spot Runner site
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:10.920]   and look at the pre-made ads by industry, it's pretty funny.
[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:11.440]   Oh, really?
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:12.160]   Should we play some?
[01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:12.520]   Let's see.
[01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:13.320]   No, no.
[01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:15.520]   Just on your own free time.
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:15.920]   Oh, no.
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:17.640]   I want to personalize a TV ad.
[01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:18.720]   I want to try it.
[01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:19.320]   Yeah, let me play one.
[01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:21.040]   You want to successfactors.com.
[01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:22.000]   This sounds like--
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.000]   Pizza.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:23.520]   No, wait a minute.
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:24.040]   Worst logo.
[01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:24.520]   I haven't.
[01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:25.040]   I haven't.
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:25.800]   No, no, wait a minute.
[01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:26.320]   I want to--
[01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:26.800]   Which one?
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:27.320]   I want to--
[01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:28.040]   Successfactors.
[01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:29.240]   I'm playing Spot Runner ads.
[01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:30.360]   I think it's kind of old-fashioned.
[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:31.480]   I don't think it's the worst.
[01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:41.000]   The show has left me behind, but I'm going to continue it on.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.000]   Pizza.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.200]   It sounds good.
[01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:44.640]   Pretty much all the time.
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:47.640]   Thankfully, there's a number you can call whenever that urge hits.
[01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:48.800]   Six more, three, four--
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:50.400]   One pizza, seven, go for Spot.
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:51.400]   Spot Runner Pizza.
[01:14:51.400 --> 01:14:52.440]   The best place in town for delicious--
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:53.440]   Upload your first image here.
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:55.440]   --taking that pizza delivered right to you during--
[01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:56.440]   Upload your second image here.
[01:14:56.440 --> 01:14:57.440]   --oppression movies.
[01:14:57.440 --> 01:14:58.440]   Hand-tossed, made from scratch.
[01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:00.440]   There's a reason our pizza tastes so good.
[01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:02.440]   People access.
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:03.720]   Those are the best.
[01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:07.120]   Those local guys can't even figure out how to use this.
[01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:08.960]   Besides that many of these local ones that you say
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:11.240]   it's going to kill off, they like to get on TV.
[01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:12.960]   They think it's going to break.
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:14.160]   But this is terrible.
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:16.440]   You see one of these, especially if you can just put two side
[01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:18.120]   by side for two different products.
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:19.760]   You're going to say this is--
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:21.280]   People aren't going to like it.
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:22.600]   Well, thank goodness there's YouTube.
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:27.800]   You see all the bad cable access ads you ever wanted to see
[01:15:27.800 --> 01:15:28.760]   on YouTube.
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:32.880]   Somebody uploaded-- I saw a link to the worst ad ever.
[01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:36.480]   It was some insurance company with an eagle on the roof
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:39.800]   laying a giant egg.
[01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:41.520]   Have you seen this?
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:42.920]   I don't know what I like it already.
[01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:45.000]   It's an auto insurance ad.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.280]   I'm going to play it because it's just the worst acted ad.
[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:50.880]   Apparently, people who lived in Chicago--
[01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:52.920]   this is a beloved ad because they played it so much.
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:54.000]   And it's so bad.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.800]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:57.800]   What's that?
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:01.640]   Do you have insurance on this car?
[01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:02.640]   No.
[01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:06.000]   It must be Eagle Man.
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:07.720]   There's an eagle sitting on the roof.
[01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:08.200]   It's on the window.
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:10.080]   Give me something the white to window with.
[01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:11.400]   Oh, I mean, this is a mashup.
[01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:14.880]   But basically, the Eagle Man is sitting on their car roof
[01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:17.040]   and lays an egg.
[01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:20.200]   Let's see if I can skip ahead to the actual Eagle Man.
[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:21.200]   Here you go.
[01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:21.920]   Here you go.
[01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:25.560]   It must be Eagle Man.
[01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:26.760]   So what's the--
[01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:34.240]   I've got something for you, the lowest cost SR-22.
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:35.400]   Now he lays a giant--
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:36.400]   Oh!
[01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:37.400]   Oh!
[01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:38.400]   Oh!
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:39.400]   Egg.
[01:16:39.400 --> 01:16:40.400]   Oh, OK.
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:41.400]   That's an--
[01:16:41.400 --> 01:16:42.240]   Brother.
[01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:43.400]   That was pretty bad.
[01:16:43.400 --> 01:16:45.200]   It's the worst ad of all time.
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:46.320]   And it's--
[01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:48.400]   you know, a spot runner could do some--
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:48.920]   Oh, man.
[01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:50.680]   V-true, we did already--
[01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:51.840]   Success factors, we're on.
[01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:53.040]   Success factors.
[01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:53.920]   Oh, we're success factors.
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:55.320]   These guys are doing 100 at number 20.
[01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:57.160]   John and I have already started talking about it.
[01:16:57.160 --> 01:17:00.640]   They're doing 100 million doing some--
[01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:01.440]   I don't know.
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:02.600]   They have 400 employees.
[01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:04.880]   It must be doing a suite of simple web-based tools
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:07.080]   that automate important, but previously paper-driven
[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:09.560]   management chores, performance reviews, session planning,
[01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:10.760]   and compensation.
[01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:12.320]   SAP Online.
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:13.400]   Yeah, SAP.
[01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:15.040]   Jan Rain.
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:16.800]   Hi, my name's Jan.
[01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:18.000]   And I'm going to make it rain.
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.400]   Oh, I kind of like that logo.
[01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:20.640]   It's a single sign on.
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:21.640]   Hmm.
[01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:24.600]   I like how everybody went boring and started snoring
[01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:27.240]   the one thing on this list that's making insane amounts of money.
[01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:28.240]   I know.
[01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:31.240]   No, but isn't it always that way?
[01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:33.240]   That's the boring cement.
[01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:34.560]   That's where you make the money.
[01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:35.880]   Make money and cement.
[01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:37.240]   Logoworks.com.
[01:17:37.240 --> 01:17:38.800]   Barrels.
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:41.120]   We didn't actually talk about what Jan Rain does.
[01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:42.280]   They've developed a single--
[01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:43.040]   Did you say that?
[01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:44.880]   Yeah, but you know how many of these.
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:47.120]   Have you noticed how many open ID--
[01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:48.280]   all of a sudden, open ID is everywhere.
[01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:49.840]   Does that scare you?
[01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:51.920]   Like to give your passwords to a lot of people.
[01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:52.280]   Yes.
[01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:55.200]   I mean, to give your password to one centralized password
[01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:56.200]   scoring site.
[01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:57.520]   Well, the thing about open ID is you can go to--
[01:17:57.520 --> 01:18:00.240]   there's only a few sites now that support open ID.
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:02.000]   Yeah, and it saves one of them.
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.040]   And it saves it.
[01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:03.680]   It loves it.
[01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:06.560]   You go there and you give them your open ID ID.
[01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:08.840]   In my case, I signed up for one with claim ID.
[01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:11.000]   So it's claimid.com/leo.
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.400]   Log in through claim ID.
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:15.160]   And these people accept my credentials.
[01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:17.240]   I don't think it's such a bad thing.
[01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:18.040]   OK.
[01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:18.520]   It's OK.
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:19.640]   Let's go to logoworks.
[01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:21.520]   Does anybody but me think that maybe they
[01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:23.920]   sell more of their product if their logo--
[01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:24.440]   was better.
[01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:26.440]   It took the words right out of my mouth.
[01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:27.040]   Decent.
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:28.280]   You know, they get those little--
[01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:29.240]   We designed logos.
[01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:32.040]   Here's an example.
[01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:32.760]   I don't even get it.
[01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:34.080]   It's like, is that a guitar?
[01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:34.920]   I mean, what is that little--
[01:18:34.920 --> 01:18:35.800]   It's a palette.
[01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:36.600]   I think it's a palette.
[01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:37.520]   You're right.
[01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:37.920]   Oh, yeah.
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:39.080]   Good eye.
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:41.480]   But we really had to think about it, didn't we?
[01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:42.200]   Well, you did, yeah.
[01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:45.480]   Their customers include Toyota and Pfizer.
[01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:45.960]   Who's that?
[01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:47.160]   Somebody bought a copy?
[01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:53.120]   rearedencomers.com, a web-based virtual personal assistant.
[01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:53.960]   Don't change my mind.
[01:18:53.960 --> 01:18:57.080]   This is my least favorite logo compared to the other one.
[01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:57.520]   Wow.
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:18:58.680]   It doesn't even work.
[01:18:58.680 --> 01:18:59.200]   Yeah.
[01:18:59.200 --> 01:19:02.600]   That actually looks like the red line bicycle logo.
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:04.920]   If you look at it from the side, it kind of looks like a horse.
[01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:07.080]   But I would like a personal assistant, web-based virtual--
[01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:08.040]   Talk about what?
[01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:09.720]   --to the virtual personal assistant.
[01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:10.880]   Rear-decent.
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:11.320]   Rear-decent.
[01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:11.880]   Commerce.
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:13.400]   The R thing, if you can look at it.
[01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:14.160]   I would--
[01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:15.920]   I would really like one of those.
[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:16.160]   So--
[01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:16.960]   Yeah, you need one.
[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:17.480]   I do know.
[01:19:17.480 --> 01:19:19.280]   --we're in commerce.com, Leo.
[01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:23.320]   Simul scribe, an effective way to convert voicemail into scannable text.
[01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:24.000]   OK, thank you.
[01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:24.520]   Bye.
[01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:28.040]   That's it for the 25 top startups.
[01:19:28.040 --> 01:19:31.280]   OK.
[01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:32.800]   Did you see that Fuzzy Zeller is mad?
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:36.240]   Because somebody put a defamatory paragraph in his Wikipedia article.
[01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:37.680]   And now--
[01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:39.760]   And now he's suing.
[01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:42.920]   Well, the best part was that he tried to do it as a John Doe.
[01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:45.560]   Like anyone else would care that his Wikipedia entry had been--
[01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:46.600]   Right.
[01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:48.960]   He's got-- well, because he has to go to the ISP
[01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:51.360]   or to Wikipedia.
[01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:52.040]   Who did it?
[01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:52.840]   Who?
[01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:56.640]   It's like-- it was apparently came out of some office, right?
[01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:58.200]   A law firm in like, Florida?
[01:19:58.200 --> 01:19:58.840]   Yeah, Miami.
[01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:01.080]   It's an education consulting firm.
[01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:03.440]   And it's basically the equivalent of going to the office saying,
[01:20:03.440 --> 01:20:07.640]   I am not leaving until you tell me who did it.
[01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:08.440]   That's pretty funny.
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:09.520]   That's a good voice.
[01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:12.400]   Yeah, that's my Fuzzy Zeller imitation.
[01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:13.320]   Very useful.
[01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:15.960]   When you draw attention to yourself as something, that's stupid.
[01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:19.720]   It seems to me that you're going to get some one or two hackers out
[01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:22.480]   there that just look like to make people's lives miserable,
[01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:23.560]   who react like that.
[01:20:23.560 --> 01:20:24.240]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:25.840]   I mean, you can get yourself into a lot of trouble.
[01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:26.600]   I agree.
[01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:28.200]   Somebody defames me in my Wikipedia.
[01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:30.080]   I embrace it.
[01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:36.120]   PureTrack says we're going to do copy protection free MP3s
[01:20:36.120 --> 01:20:38.440]   of any artists that allow us to all the independent artists,
[01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:41.280]   including the Bear Naked Ladies and Ceramoc Loughlin.
[01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:41.800]   It's a PureTrack--
[01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:42.280]   In Canada.
[01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:46.280]   It is a Canadian Napster or Rhapsody.
[01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:47.720]   Yeah, it's not going to be here.
[01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:48.480]   It's only--
[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:48.480]   No.
[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:49.960]   Everything here is still windows.
[01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:51.720]   Yeah, but this is the beginning.
[01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:53.480]   Somebody took Steve up on his--
[01:20:53.480 --> 01:20:55.920]   I know Steve still isn't doing it.
[01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:57.680]   No.
[01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:00.160]   I don't think they're the only people taking him up on it.
[01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:00.760]   I mean--
[01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:01.280]   Yeah, I was talking about it.
[01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:02.400]   Yeah, I was talking about it.
[01:21:02.400 --> 01:21:05.840]   But now if they get bought by Warner, that's all out the window.
[01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:07.160]   But I think it might happen.
[01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:07.960]   I love this idea.
[01:21:07.960 --> 01:21:09.080]   I just wish it would happen here and not in the--
[01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:10.680]   Could it be the crack and the wall,
[01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:13.240]   the beginning of the end of DRM?
[01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:14.320]   I like to think so.
[01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:14.840]   I hope so.
[01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:17.920]   I like to think the fact that Blu-ray and HCDVD
[01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:19.840]   being compromised in less than a year
[01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:23.280]   is going to be the great crack in the wall of DRM.
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:25.880]   Well, except for Ohio University Perdue
[01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:29.120]   and the University of Nebraska.
[01:21:29.120 --> 01:21:31.440]   They were the colleges that had the most piracy.
[01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:32.800]   The most piracy.
[01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:37.200]   According to the RIA, the top 25 music pirating schools
[01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:38.760]   in the country.
[01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:40.640]   Good times.
[01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:41.960]   Is there a list on here somewhere?
[01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:42.480]   Yeah, there is.
[01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:44.360]   Ohio, Purdue, University of Nebraska.
[01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:48.440]   It's all giant Midwestern colleges in universities.
[01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:50.200]   There's nothing really in California.
[01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:52.120]   You know what that list really tells you?
[01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:52.800]   What?
[01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:55.240]   Those guys can't cover their tracks as well as the sport boys.
[01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:55.720]   That's what it is.
[01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:56.080]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:21:56.080 --> 01:21:56.520]   I think it is.
[01:21:56.520 --> 01:21:58.840]   I think it's just way more people at those schools.
[01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:01.440]   Yeah, there's like a quarter of a million students
[01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:02.600]   or something that might look like that.
[01:22:02.600 --> 01:22:03.640]   Yeah, I will be used on there.
[01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:04.480]   Be used on there too.
[01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:05.120]   That's a big school.
[01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:05.840]   Did you go to be you?
[01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:07.280]   No, I went to Emerson.
[01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:08.920]   That's a small school.
[01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:09.960]   Just like Ralph Waldo.
[01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:11.720]   I'm telling you, they just don't know what they're doing.
[01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:12.880]   That's the problem.
[01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:15.520]   These are actually how many--
[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:20.360]   actually, you make it on the list by being the most sued.
[01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:21.640]   Oh, so it's number of suits.
[01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:23.880]   Number of suits that we've sent.
[01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:26.720]   Man, I'm so glad they weren't doing that when I was in college.
[01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:27.400]   So when people--
[01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:28.640]   Did you pirate saw--
[01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:30.240]   I had Napster at the time.
[01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:31.280]   Yeah, I stopped using it though.
[01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:31.840]   Oh, my god, you're--
[01:22:31.840 --> 01:22:33.960]   Oh, you should have gotten into media early and get stuff
[01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:34.680]   for free.
[01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:35.680]   Yeah.
[01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:37.840]   Oh, my god.
[01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:40.480]   So let's wrap this up with talking urinal cakes,
[01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:43.000]   because, well, frankly, we can.
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.120]   Finally.
[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:48.480]   I've been waiting and waiting for the talking urinal cake.
[01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:51.880]   So it turns out, another list, New Mexico is at the top of.
[01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:54.600]   They have more DUIs in any of the other state in the union.
[01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:59.840]   The state recently paid $21 each for $500 talking urinal
[01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:02.320]   deodorizer cakes.
[01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:05.120]   They put in men's room and bars across the--
[01:23:05.120 --> 01:23:07.160]   You know, what's a missing opportunity here?
[01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:09.520]   These guys should be thinking in terms of--
[01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:10.960]   is creating--
[01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:13.480]   monetizing these in such a way that over the internet,
[01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:17.080]   you can put the message on urinal cake for $1 apiece.
[01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:19.480]   And so you can say some of these guys.
[01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:21.320]   Hey, hey, hey, hey, I'm down here.
[01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:22.160]   Help me out here.
[01:23:22.160 --> 01:23:24.440]   Help me out here.
[01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:25.320]   Well, that's like--
[01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:27.040]   remember when the urinals--
[01:23:27.040 --> 01:23:29.640]   they used to say, just say no to drugs?
[01:23:29.640 --> 01:23:31.160]   Yes.
[01:23:31.160 --> 01:23:33.920]   I have very little education on the state of urinal cakes.
[01:23:33.920 --> 01:23:35.000]   No, you wouldn't know much about it.
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:35.960]   Unfortunately.
[01:23:35.960 --> 01:23:37.760]   But it would like you to read the announcement.
[01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:39.520]   They had the little spinners on them.
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:40.160]   What?
[01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:42.240]   You could hit the part.
[01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:42.760]   Oh, yes.
[01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:44.880]   You're going to eat a cake for urinal anyway.
[01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:45.680]   Not eat it.
[01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:46.640]   You know, unfortunately.
[01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:48.800]   You're going to the giant mint in the urinal.
[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:49.880]   I've seen that poster.
[01:23:49.880 --> 01:23:52.280]   Right now, boy hats.
[01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:55.000]   So it was one of my favorite graffiti
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.400]   graffiti grophitos of all time.
[01:23:56.400 --> 01:23:58.880]   So when you step up--
[01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:01.720]   the theory is if you're a drunk, the last thing you do,
[01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:04.280]   before you get in the car, is you visit the men's room.
[01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:06.160]   So you're really drunk, you're peeing outside.
[01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:06.680]   I know.
[01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:07.920]   Yeah, or on yourself.
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:08.360]   I--
[01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:09.560]   Yeah.
[01:24:09.560 --> 01:24:11.880]   That's what the bench seats are for.
[01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:14.040]   So the guy steps up to the urinal.
[01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:15.200]   It's motion sensitive.
[01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:16.520]   And it says--
[01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:17.600]   Of course it is.
[01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:20.000]   First, today, a woman's voice that's flirty.
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:21.240]   All right, all right.
[01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:23.840]   Hey, big guy, having a few drinks.
[01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:25.240]   Think you had one too many?
[01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:27.440]   Now it's time to call a cab or call a sober friend
[01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:28.800]   for a ride home.
[01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:30.080]   And then it ends with--
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:32.120]   remember, your future is in your hand.
[01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:32.760]   That's my favorite.
[01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:33.760]   What?
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:35.080]   All right, I'm the designated driver.
[01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:36.640]   Couldn't I at least have said hands instead of hands?
[01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:37.560]   No, hand right there.
[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:38.680]   Is that-- that's a joke, right?
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:39.680]   That's the joke.
[01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:40.200]   Man.
[01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:42.200]   I just-- I just-- I'm just stumbling back out to the table
[01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:44.200]   and going, dude, my pee just talked to me.
[01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:46.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:47.680]   You got the car.
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:48.680]   Drive home now.
[01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:50.120]   You just made me clapping, glee.
[01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:53.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:54.840]   This is not cool.
[01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:59.640]   So if you're getting all excited about the Oscars tonight
[01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:02.200]   and you want to see the movies before the vote,
[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:04.960]   download them from Pirate Bay, the very special Oscar
[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:07.840]   torrent site they've set up just for you.
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:09.280]   God, these guys.
[01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:12.480]   With some of the most swaggering remarks that you've got ever
[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:13.000]   seen.
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:17.280]   I love how much bravado they have with everything they do.
[01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:19.160]   It's like there's a point in it.
[01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:22.480]   I haven't-- it's just it's so all over the map
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:23.760]   with their little--
[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:25.160]   Let's buy an island.
[01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:27.080]   Yeah, that's over, right?
[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:27.760]   They gave up.
[01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:29.720]   But I mean, reading that last paragraph, Lee, OK,
[01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:31.320]   maybe you should read that in the Bill Gates voice.
[01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:33.080]   I don't know.
[01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:34.400]   OK, you want me to?
[01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:36.040]   You haven't beaten us?
[01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:37.360]   Actually, you know what?
[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:39.240]   The Oscar torrent site totally fits
[01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:42.280]   in the John's definition of an insane versus website.
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:42.640]   It's in--
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:44.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:45.000]   Big red banners.
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000]   All they need is some matching jiffs.
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:48.160]   That's pretty funny.
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:48.960]   That's really funny.
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:49.400]   This is awesome.
[01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:49.760]   It's like--
[01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:49.760]   It's like--
[01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:49.760]   It's like--
[01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:49.760]   It's like--
[01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:50.760]   It's like--
[01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:51.760]   It's like a--
[01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:52.760]   It's like a--
[01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:53.760]   It's like a--
[01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:54.760]   It's not that bad.
[01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:55.760]   It's not that bad.
[01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:56.760]   Oscar torrent site.
[01:25:56.760 --> 01:25:57.760]   It's like-- you know, it's--
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:25:59.120]   It just cracks me up.
[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:00.200]   You haven't beaten us.
[01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:01.560]   So why not join us?
[01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:03.360]   I think actually it should really be a pirate.
[01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:04.760]   Think of a new business model that
[01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:07.280]   doesn't involve overpriced pieces of plastic
[01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:08.960]   and stanky cinemas are.
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:11.280]   Hot, gimme cheap car, but I hate rates
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:13.920]   while relying on a $6 per hour projectionist who
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:15.480]   can't keep a film in focus.
[01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:16.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:19.080]   It sounds really somebody who's really cranked--
[01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:20.280]   Cranky grandpa.
[01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:21.280]   I mentioned--
[01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:24.160]   In something your audience buy to pick a few examples,
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:28.160]   surveilling us with night vision glasses, searching bags,
[01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:30.960]   30 minutes of commercials, and bombarding us
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:34.280]   with ridiculous anti-piracy propaganda.
[01:26:34.280 --> 01:26:35.280]   Wow.
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:36.280]   You should be in LA while you're doing those for us.
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:37.280]   Oh, yeah, I could make--
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:39.040]   He actually does some great voices, I have to say.
[01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:39.540]   Yeah.
[01:26:39.540 --> 01:26:40.540]   One of these days I'll do one.
[01:26:40.540 --> 01:26:43.360]   Nobody appreciates about me.
[01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:44.280]   German guy again.
[01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:45.520]   No, that's okay.
[01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:47.480]   Bill Gates says, "Windows Vista has
[01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:49.880]   had an incredible reception."
[01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:51.080]   German Bill Kane?
[01:26:51.080 --> 01:26:52.280]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:52.800]   I like it.
[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:53.280]   I like it.
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:54.840]   So a little bit of a sit-seizor to it.
[01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:55.840]   Yeah, that's nice.
[01:26:55.840 --> 01:26:57.840]   The funny thing about this incredible reception
[01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:00.120]   is it could be anything.
[01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:00.960]   It could be good.
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:02.480]   They had that big party in New York.
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:03.560]   It could be bad.
[01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:06.080]   It's just incredible.
[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:06.760]   Oh, no.
[01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:09.480]   No, he goes on to say, "People whose cell PCs have seen--"
[01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:11.560]   This is kind of a weasel word, too--
[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:14.040]   a very nice lift in their sales.
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:15.120]   Of course they have.
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:18.360]   People have been waiting to buy a new PC for Vista
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:20.760]   to ship for like nine and a half months.
[01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:23.240]   But didn't Ballmer say the exact opposite, like the week
[01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:23.760]   before?
[01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:24.440]   He was trying to--
[01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:24.940]   Of course.
[01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:26.120]   But did, because Ballmer's always
[01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:27.400]   trying to-- Ballmer's the one who's
[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:30.240]   got his head on the plate with Wall Street.
[01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:31.960]   And he's also trying to terminally
[01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:35.720]   fill every salesperson at Microsoft with fear.
[01:27:35.720 --> 01:27:36.840]   That's his job.
[01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:38.720]   Yeah, it's a different audience.
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:41.160]   Ballmer was trying to lower expectations on Wall Street.
[01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:45.040]   Bill Gates is trying to get Reuters to say,
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:47.640]   Windows is selling great.
[01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:49.360]   Asked by Reuters if there was anything
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:51.400]   that would make Microsoft cautious about the outlook
[01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:55.280]   for Vista, Gates replied, "I don't know what you mean.
[01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:56.720]   If this is hadn't been credible."
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:57.720]   It's inconceivable.
[01:27:57.720 --> 01:27:58.720]   It's inconceivable.
[01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:00.560]   The reviews have been fantastic.
[01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:02.360]   This is a--
[01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:04.720]   I do not think it means what you think it means.
[01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:06.280]   It means what you think it means.
[01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:07.000]   That's my favorite.
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:07.760]   My name is Niko.
[01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:11.560]   And this is the big big advance in the Windows platform.
[01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:13.480]   It's the world's most used piece of software.
[01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:17.320]   Overall, the reliability feedback has been, well, better
[01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:18.240]   than we expected.
[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:21.720]   Oh, a little weasel word there from Bill.
[01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:24.320]   Anybody want to say anything about XM and Sirius
[01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:25.920]   trying to tie the knot?
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:26.920]   I'm psyched.
[01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:30.360]   Actually, I want to know how Kevin Reynolds can pretty much
[01:28:30.360 --> 01:28:33.280]   like Clear Channel own every radio station in North America,
[01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:34.600]   or at least half of them.
[01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:37.840]   But it's upset with the two competing satellite.
[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:40.120]   The two foundering satellite radio.
[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:41.640]   Will they get regulatory approval?
[01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:45.640]   I absolutely think that terrestrial radio and streaming
[01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:48.640]   online and iPods and podcasts and all of that.
[01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:52.320]   I think that's perfectly legitimate going up
[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:53.960]   against satellite radio.
[01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:54.800]   Are you two of them?
[01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:55.920]   Which one do you have?
[01:28:55.920 --> 01:28:56.760]   I don't have either.
[01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:57.280]   That's the thing.
[01:28:57.280 --> 01:28:59.040]   I've never been able to choose because I couldn't tell
[01:28:59.040 --> 01:28:59.560]   the difference.
[01:28:59.560 --> 01:29:00.960]   I didn't know which was better.
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:03.600]   There's another thing that people
[01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:05.600]   seem to overlook about this.
[01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:07.360]   These guys should get together because I don't think they
[01:29:07.360 --> 01:29:07.760]   can barely--
[01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:08.760]   I think they can barely--
[01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:09.280]   They're a dog.
[01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:10.960]   No, they're not profitable right now.
[01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:12.320]   Yeah, it's not like they're a dog.
[01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:13.920]   But what's going to kill them is this--
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:15.000]   the things that are going to-- there's
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.320]   two things that are out there that are going to kill these guys
[01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:17.520]   off.
[01:29:17.520 --> 01:29:19.320]   One is HD radio.
[01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:20.160]   No way.
[01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:21.160]   No way.
[01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:22.160]   No way.
[01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:25.360]   It's just another nail in the coffin because it does give you--
[01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:27.080]   No, it's not, John.
[01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:28.240]   It's not even a good company.
[01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:32.240]   And the real problem is going to be as soon as they start
[01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:35.080]   putting TV like devices in regular cars.
[01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:35.640]   They won't.
[01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:37.080]   The RIA will never let them.
[01:29:37.080 --> 01:29:37.580]   Remember?
[01:29:37.580 --> 01:29:38.600]   You know, I'm telling you.
[01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:39.320]   Remember something about--
[01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:40.400]   I tried this.
[01:29:40.400 --> 01:29:43.280]   They wouldn't even let Sirius and XM have players that could
[01:29:43.280 --> 01:29:44.840]   record and be crazy over the air.
[01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:46.480]   So they're not just not going to have it.
[01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:49.000]   If you remember a few years ago, there
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.680]   was this big deal where you couldn't stream radio over the
[01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:53.920]   internet because of the advertising that was embedded
[01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:54.680]   and all the rest of it.
[01:29:54.680 --> 01:29:55.480]   And that was a big deal.
[01:29:55.480 --> 01:29:57.520]   That was going to kill this kind of thing.
[01:29:57.520 --> 01:29:59.560]   And next thing you know, that change.
[01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:02.040]   I'm telling you, eventually we're going to have T-vos on
[01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:04.040]   radios in cars.
[01:30:04.040 --> 01:30:06.040]   Yeah, and you know what, John, compared to the--
[01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:08.880]   Incredible adoption rate of HD radio.
[01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:10.520]   Yeah, the radio's on cars.
[01:30:10.520 --> 01:30:12.680]   Boy, what's the market penetration?
[01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:13.680]   Not the--
[01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:14.180]   I don't care.
[01:30:14.180 --> 01:30:15.040]   I've been right out right.
[01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:16.240]   It's just a buzz out loud.
[01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:17.080]   Here's the sound.
[01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:19.200]   The whole point of having satellite radio--
[01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:21.320]   So I don't have to listen to the crappy local radio
[01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:21.820]   stations.
[01:30:21.820 --> 01:30:23.640]   There's one radio station that doesn't make me want to
[01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:25.520]   hurl half the time in San Francisco.
[01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:28.840]   Why would I want to spend $200 to $400 to upgrade my car
[01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:32.480]   stereo so I could listen to one station in beautiful
[01:30:32.480 --> 01:30:34.120]   digital FM clarity?
[01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:36.280]   I'm sorry, HD radio's going nowhere.
[01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:37.440]   It's going nowhere fast.
[01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:39.880]   OK, so I've never heard it, so I could be wrong.
[01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:42.400]   It's fabulous if you have a radio station that you like
[01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:43.200]   locally.
[01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:44.200]   I guess.
[01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:46.280]   I could listen to the classical radio station.
[01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:46.840]   That's why I can--
[01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:49.160]   And I could listen to this sort of midnight to 4 AM.
[01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:51.160]   Does it sound that much better?
[01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:52.160]   Yeah, it does.
[01:30:52.160 --> 01:30:52.660]   You know what?
[01:30:52.660 --> 01:30:54.720]   So they're competition, so use both.
[01:30:54.720 --> 01:30:57.920]   Have your trustable radio and then have your ex-em serious
[01:30:57.920 --> 01:30:58.600]   at the same time.
[01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:01.160]   Why you don't have to pick if they allow it to go through.
[01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:04.600]   I'm just glad I don't have to choose between Oprah and Howard
[01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:04.600]   to start--
[01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:05.100]   There you go.
[01:31:05.100 --> 01:31:05.600]   --stirring.
[01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:06.100]   --in the world.
[01:31:06.100 --> 01:31:06.760]   --of my happy world.
[01:31:06.760 --> 01:31:08.280]   --in the country.
[01:31:08.280 --> 01:31:11.040]   I don't want to spend $13 a month to listen to the radio
[01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:12.680]   on a night night car all day.
[01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:13.200]   You know what?
[01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:14.680]   No, that's not a problem.
[01:31:14.680 --> 01:31:16.680]   $10 for a movie--
[01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:19.160]   --for a potentially crappy 90-minute movie is a problem.
[01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:21.840]   $13 a month for like 125 radio stations.
[01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:24.160]   But there's so much good music on your iPod already.
[01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:26.120]   There's so many podcasts you can listen to.
[01:31:26.120 --> 01:31:26.920]   Books on tape.
[01:31:26.920 --> 01:31:27.520]   I don't know about that.
[01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:28.040]   But you know what?
[01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:30.160]   The thing with me is I want to have ex-em serious
[01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:32.280]   because I want to be able to discover new music.
[01:31:32.280 --> 01:31:34.280]   And I know there's podcasts out there that do that.
[01:31:34.280 --> 01:31:37.040]   But that was the main reason I used to listen to radio.
[01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:39.440]   And now I don't really listen to radio anymore.
[01:31:39.440 --> 01:31:41.600]   But I feel like I'm stuck in this trend of listening
[01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:42.800]   to the same podcast all the time.
[01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:43.160]   I used to say that.
[01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:45.600]   I'm just not finding a really good solution
[01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:48.600]   for discovering music that's on the air right now.
[01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:49.920]   Here's the funny thing for me.
[01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:52.400]   It's like every time we run a car and we get whatever
[01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:54.600]   a model that's got, I think it's XM.
[01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:56.240]   I mean, I always really enjoy it.
[01:31:56.240 --> 01:31:57.280]   And I flip around.
[01:31:57.280 --> 01:31:57.760]   Me too.
[01:31:57.760 --> 01:31:59.960]   You get used to the fact that there's that really
[01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:02.520]   janky satellite delay every time you change the station.
[01:32:02.520 --> 01:32:05.840]   But even still, so then when they flash forward,
[01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:09.400]   they added a bunch of ex-em stations to our direct TV.
[01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:12.840]   And the package we have has an embarrassment of ex-em
[01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:13.360]   stations.
[01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:14.400]   And so I think, oh, this is great.
[01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:16.160]   I'm going to be listening to this all the time.
[01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:17.760]   And the fact is, I don't.
[01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:18.880]   I mean, I've got-- it's there.
[01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:20.560]   And I don't know what the difference is.
[01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:22.520]   Maybe it's just that it's not as easy to get to as having
[01:32:22.520 --> 01:32:23.720]   an on in the car.
[01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:26.440]   But it doesn't do it for me in the same way as--
[01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:28.120]   I think it's really best for cars,
[01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:29.920]   because I don't have a car right now.
[01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:33.520]   The Dish Network has had serious on the Dish Forever.
[01:32:33.520 --> 01:32:34.800]   And I rarely listen to it.
[01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:36.520]   You know, we use it for Christmas music.
[01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:37.480]   Cars and portable places.
[01:32:37.480 --> 01:32:38.400]   Every Christmas.
[01:32:38.400 --> 01:32:40.520]   Yeah, every Christmas they put on a bunch of stations
[01:32:40.520 --> 01:32:41.400]   like Christmas.
[01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:43.920]   Or you can go to that one station that always plays the pixies.
[01:32:43.920 --> 01:32:45.920]   You know, there's a few stations that you can dig.
[01:32:45.920 --> 01:32:46.760]   But I don't know.
[01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:49.440]   I just-- I think the other thing that's key is having
[01:32:49.440 --> 01:32:52.600]   some ease of having one of those units that plays in your car.
[01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:54.320]   Like the pie in your in-house.
[01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:56.720]   Like something like that that you can take with you on the go.
[01:32:56.720 --> 01:32:57.720]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:32:57.720 --> 01:32:58.720]   Kind of like an iPod.
[01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:00.920]   But then you can plug it into a car adapter.
[01:33:00.920 --> 01:33:02.920]   And then it's your car player.
[01:33:02.920 --> 01:33:05.120]   Well, I'm going to recuse myself, since I'm the--
[01:33:05.120 --> 01:33:08.920]   actually do a radio show on the rear.
[01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:09.720]   Why?
[01:33:09.720 --> 01:33:12.240]   And I am, in fact, I think going to have a radio show on XM.
[01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:14.560]   But anyway, I'll just say--
[01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:15.680]   I think it's going to trash it.
[01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:17.120]   So you basically sold out.
[01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:17.960]   Yeah.
[01:33:17.960 --> 01:33:19.520]   OK.
[01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:21.400]   So I think the merger's a great thing.
[01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:23.640]   I think it's the only thing that's going to save satellite radio.
[01:33:23.640 --> 01:33:26.000]   Yeah, it's like two poor people moving in together.
[01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:26.000]   Yeah.
[01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:27.800]   How many people in the industry--
[01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:29.640]   Into the same box, into the same car.
[01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:30.920]   We're going to share a cardboard box.
[01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:32.800]   You know, I have to say, it's really interesting,
[01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:35.040]   because so many people I know, and especially on Buzzat Loud,
[01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:38.200]   we're usually very anti-big merger type of situation
[01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:40.200]   and monopoly and that kind of thing.
[01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:43.080]   And this time, everyone's really positive about it.
[01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:45.120]   And all the people that I've talked to a lot in the industry
[01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:46.920]   have been saying that they're pleased
[01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:48.000]   and they hope it goes through.
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:51.320]   I think they realize it's the only thing that can save them.
[01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:52.920]   It has to happen.
[01:33:52.920 --> 01:33:54.640]   And I'm hoping regulators feel the same way.
[01:33:54.640 --> 01:33:55.480]   I think they will.
[01:33:55.480 --> 01:33:56.640]   Congress is going to weigh on it.
[01:33:56.640 --> 01:33:58.520]   50/50 chance, I guess.
[01:33:58.520 --> 01:34:00.400]   Couldn't they just do the whole satellite phone thing,
[01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:02.880]   where they declare chapter 11, absolve themselves
[01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:04.520]   of all their deaths, start over again?
[01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:05.600]   Basically, that's--
[01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:09.720]   No, but it's better for consumers, if they merged.
[01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:10.800]   No, no, I agree.
[01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:12.600]   I'm just being a wise ass.
[01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:18.040]   So you know, I think another big threat is AM stereo.
[01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:19.760]   It's back, baby.
[01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:22.960]   First up, if I'm not the channel, then I'm in the right channel.
[01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:24.280]   Let the channel--
[01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:25.080]   Right channel.
[01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:26.800]   It's amazing.
[01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:29.520]   Ladies and gentlemen, you can catch Buzzat Loud and Glorious
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:34.720]   Monarol Sound at boL.cnet.com.
[01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:36.480]   And that's where Veronica Belmont is.
[01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:38.680]   She actually-- didn't you start on that show
[01:34:38.680 --> 01:34:40.920]   as the engineer, practically?
[01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:45.320]   Yeah, I started at CINA as an audio production producer.
[01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:48.280]   And then so I was doing the producing on Buzzat Loud,
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:51.880]   and then I just started chipping and talking,
[01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:52.760]   opening my big mouth.
[01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:55.400]   You, Tom and Molly, really make a great show every single day.
[01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:55.920]   Thank you.

[01:34:58.880 --> 01:34:59.560]   I hope you'll come back.
[01:34:59.560 --> 01:35:00.280]   It was a lot of fun.
[01:35:00.280 --> 01:35:01.040]   Thank you.
[01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:01.480]   Yeah.
[01:35:01.480 --> 01:35:05.280]   From dl.tv, it's Patrick Norton.
[01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:06.360]   We're so glad to have you.
[01:35:06.360 --> 01:35:07.560]   In fact, we're trying to get you to come up
[01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:09.800]   for a mini reunion on Call for Help
[01:35:09.800 --> 01:35:12.560]   when we start the new version of Call for Help the Lab.
[01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:14.480]   Well, I'll make a deal with you, Leo.
[01:35:14.480 --> 01:35:15.360]   What's that?
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:19.520]   If you honor my request that I've been making for 18 months
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:23.200]   to come to a guest segment on dl.tv, I'll fly up--
[01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:23.760]   Fair trade.
[01:35:23.760 --> 01:35:27.200]   --and Hoover on my own dollar per your request.
[01:35:27.200 --> 01:35:27.720]   Fair trade.
[01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:28.560]   And come to the show.
[01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:30.480]   It is his own dollar because I was informed
[01:35:30.480 --> 01:35:32.400]   we don't have any money.
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:35.800]   But until you come to dl.tv because I'm tired of answering
[01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:38.040]   that email, when's Leo going to be on dl?
[01:35:38.040 --> 01:35:39.160]   That's exactly why I don't do it.
[01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:40.520]   I like to tease.
[01:35:40.520 --> 01:35:41.040]   T-s.
[01:35:41.040 --> 01:35:44.800]   Well, you want me to fly my ass up to Vancouver?
[01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:45.800]   Get your ass down.
[01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:48.400]   Take the 45-minute drive down from Petaloo.
[01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:49.800]   This will warm the cockles of your heart.
[01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:51.440]   Catch Schwartz is coming.
[01:35:51.440 --> 01:35:52.880]   Oh, funny.
[01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:53.320]   Yeah.
[01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:55.000]   And I think Chris Perrillo.
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:56.960]   And I'm hoping we get Becky.
[01:35:56.960 --> 01:35:59.840]   And I'm trying to find Silicon Alley if you're listening.
[01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:04.080]   Give us a holler to my super secret email address.
[01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:06.800]   Because it would be fun to have Kevin and everybody
[01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:07.800]   just kind of have everybody else.
[01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:09.040]   Is all going to be on one show?
[01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:10.520]   On one big show.
[01:36:10.520 --> 01:36:12.440]   I'm fascinated and terrified.
[01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:12.940]   Yeah.
[01:36:12.940 --> 01:36:14.200]   What if someone blows up the building?
[01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:16.400]   Maybe it won't be on one show.
[01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:20.480]   John C. Devorak is at home at devorak.org/blog.
[01:36:20.480 --> 01:36:23.640]   And of course, in PC Magazine, both online and in print.
[01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:24.440]   Glad you could be here.
[01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:26.920]   As always, John, it's your show.
[01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:28.200]   We just live in it.
[01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:29.840]   Yeah.
[01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:32.840]   So by the way, anyone goes to the devorak.org/blog
[01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:34.960]   and types in Twit into the search engine
[01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:37.080]   and some of these websites that we talked about will be on there.
[01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:38.240]   Oh, that's a nice way to do it.
[01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:38.960]   Thank you.
[01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:39.960]   Because it takes us a little while.
[01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:41.880]   It takes me a little while to get the show on something.
[01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:43.560]   It's not just a pod show.
[01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:46.800]   It's an opportunity to drive traffic to the man's blog.
[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:47.760]   Exactly.
[01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:50.640]   I send them to the site that actually put together the list
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:52.360]   and did such a great job documenting them.
[01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:57.520]   When you can get these short, snappy comments from John C. Devorak.org.
[01:36:57.520 --> 01:36:58.920]   He's not slash blog.
[01:36:58.920 --> 01:37:01.920]   Who needs that top 25 web thing?
[01:37:01.920 --> 01:37:02.960]   We could do it ourselves.
[01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:04.320]   Our own commercials.
[01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:08.840]   Merlin Mann is not only a great contributor
[01:37:08.840 --> 01:37:11.560]   to 43 folders and Mac break weekly,
[01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:13.280]   but he's now got the Merlin show.
[01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:14.960]   Yes, ladies and gentlemen, a catcher's
[01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:18.040]   met with a wig and his own online video show,
[01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:21.520]   starting Monday, if all goes well.
[01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:22.600]   Right, Merlin?
[01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:23.480]   Oh, you kidding me?
[01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:24.280]   It's in the can.
[01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:25.600]   It's in the can?
[01:37:25.600 --> 01:37:27.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:37:27.560 --> 01:37:29.920]   No, it's pretty much done.
[01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:31.000]   Yeah, it's in good shape.
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:31.640]   You know what we're doing?
[01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:33.240]   We're standing off the edges.
[01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:34.240]   We haven't started shooting.
[01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:36.240]   He's shot at a lot of stuff.
[01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:37.280]   He's got a ton of stuff.
[01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:38.840]   Yeah, so yeah, it starts on Monday,
[01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:41.240]   and we're hoping to give a few things up next week.
[01:37:41.240 --> 01:37:41.720]   Cool.
[01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:43.640]   If we get one up on Monday, that'll be the first big success.
[01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:45.840]   It's a Merlin show on Merlin show.
[01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:47.360]   And you can go.
[01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:49.120]   I will pin something on your show,
[01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:50.400]   actively, for the first time.
[01:37:50.400 --> 01:37:52.880]   If you want to go, you can subscribe via iTunes
[01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:54.400]   if you go to the Merlin show.com.
[01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:54.880]   Excellent.
[01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:57.440]   We want to get it to be number one on the charts there.
[01:37:57.440 --> 01:38:00.720]   And of course, you could catch Veronica and me and Merlin
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:02.040]   on Twitter.
[01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:04.080]   Yes, all the time.

[01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:06.320]   Yeah.
[01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:07.120]   Thanks, everybody.

[01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:26.480]   I was looking for--
