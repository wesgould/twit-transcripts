[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960]   It's hyper Mac break weekly. Jason Snell, Andy, and I, Alex, Lindsay, and I were all here.
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:10.240]   Of course, we'll be talking about Apple's event a week from Monday. What will the VR headset
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.760]   bring and will it be evolutionary or revolutionary? Jason Zimbargo is lifted. You can talk about his
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:22.800]   one week review of Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro for the iPad. And then Andy brings back a classic
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.640]   Macintosh game. All that and more coming up next on Mac break weekly.
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.960]   Podcasts you love from people you trust. This is great.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:47.760]   This is Mac break weekly episode 871 recorded Tuesday, May 23rd, 2023. Andy's wild thumb.

[00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.000]   Jason Snell in the house six colors.com and he is now unembargoded.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.880]   I am I'm unencumbered by Apple and Burgos. I can tell all about
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:50.080]   headset. Nope. Final cut and logic for the iPad. I'm very very careful.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.560]   Also with this, we'll tell you about what that's all about in a second. Also with
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.600]   his Andy Inako Shaka. No, WGBH at Boston almost said the other thing.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.040]   Hello, Andrew. Hello. You always told, you always told when Jason is up from under in
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.720]   Bargo, his hair is like lighter, more and more bounce, more body.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.360]   That's right. I thought it was that shoulders. What did I know? And Mr. Alex Lindsey from
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:22.960]   office hours dot global hello. Hello, Alex. Apple's worldwide developer conference kicking off
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.000]   less than a week away. No, more than a week away. A week from Monday.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.160]   Scared me. I scared you a week from it's official though. They've put out a press release.
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.880]   So a week from Monday and we'll be here recording our coverage. We did that this morning.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:47.840]   At 9am, I got up to watch such an Adelis say Microsoft's all about AI. I kind of knew that.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.240]   Well, how much is all about the cloud? I'm gonna do it. It's the cloud and AI. It's together.
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.920]   Oh, there we go. Too great. It's about the cloud as a service in one. Yeah. And tomorrow
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.160]   we'll cover it as well from 9am. And then oh, good. I'm glad it's not this Monday,
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:09.200]   a week from Monday, June 5th, 10am Pacific. We will cover the WWDC curina, which for which
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.680]   I'm getting more. I'm excited, especially since Costco is selling Mac minis for 300 bucks.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:23.200]   That's cheaper than a brisket. There. That's clear on the map. That is in in because the
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.720]   the Raspberry Pi is so short stocked because of component shortages that might be actually
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.720]   less than you might pay for like a top of the line Raspberry Pi. Wouldn't that be
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:42.000]   one? With markups. I'm just going to stick that behind a screen and make a picture key thing.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.560]   You can put Velcro on it and just to take it to them. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.120]   I asked John, I said, do we need more Mac minis? He said, well, we have lots of Mac minis,
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.800]   but they're the old Intel ones, but they work fine. So, you know, they're doing a little
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.640]   thing to different. I know such a different but they're not doing anything. They're running,
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.080]   you know, software somewhere. We'll get, we'll get them when we need them. Anyway,
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:06.400]   they're all sold out anyway, but there's still brisket if anybody wants to pick some.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:14.240]   And giant bags of Doritos. Another Tuesday morning, another Apple announcement,
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:20.160]   they have announced a multi-billion dollar deal with Broadcom. You may remember Apple
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:27.840]   made a commitment to the US government 2021 to invest $430 billion in the US economy
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.440]   because all of their money comes from China. So, they're going to put it back into the US economy.
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.360]   So, they've made a big deal with Broadcom to build 5G
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:44.560]   radio frequency components in the US. When they say 5G, they're talking about phones, right?
[00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:51.120]   Yeah. It couldn't be anything else. The only thing and the only question is that,
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:58.320]   does that mean that they're involving themselves in US manufacturing? So, does that mean that they're
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.600]   going to be using Broadcom as their chip manufacturer for their own design of modem chips?
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.760]   Or does that mean that they're committing to sticking with Qualcomm for their modem chips
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.480]   for the next two or three years? Unclear, right? Unclear. The 5G radio, this is from CNBC,
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:18.800]   the 5G radio components developed by Broadcom will include F-Bar Filters and other wireless
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.000]   connectivity components that are going to release. These components are different
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   from the 5G modems made by Qualcomm. It seems, I mean, it doesn't tell us either
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.080]   way. I've seen some people react to the story of saying, "Wow, does this mean Apple's not making
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:38.240]   their own modems?" And I think unless we hear otherwise, no, it doesn't mean that. They are still
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:44.240]   doing that, but they have a deal with Broadcom. This is best read, I think, as a we generate jobs
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.880]   in America, press release. If it's a blue card. And not as anything beyond that, because it is,
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.160]   I mean, it's great. And they may use Broadcom to build the chips. Somebody's going to have to build
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.720]   the chips. Apple doesn't build its own chips. So, when it does make that move away from
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:02.560]   Qualcomm, if it ever does, maybe Broadcom helps with that. I don't know. But I think,
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.560]   yeah, I think you could read too much into this announcement, because this is in the,
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:11.280]   Apple loves to do these PR blitzes where they're like, "Look at how many jobs we create." And this
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:16.400]   is one of those. Yeah. It could be a Foxconn thing to remember how they made big noise. But,
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.760]   "Hey, look, we're building actual manufacturing plants in the United States and in the Midwest.
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:24.640]   We're creating jobs then five years later." "Hey, they're basically creating jobs of security
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:29.280]   guards to mind the empty lot where nothing's being built." Yeah. We're actually in an old
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:34.880]   Broadcom office right now, right here. They moved out and they moved next door, and then they've
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:44.400]   moved out next door. So, they moved down the road a piece. But Broadcom was originally part of HP,
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:52.240]   the semiconductor product division of Hewlett Packard. And then they spun it off to Agilent,
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:07:01.360]   which made Petaluma the telecom valley briefly. We had a lot of telecom going on here.
[00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:07.040]   Anyway, that's, I guess, they said they'd do it, so they've done it. And they're, "Yep, now you
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:13.200]   have it. Now you have it." Do we have them? Do we learn it? We didn't learn it. I should have
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.840]   looked at this worldwide developers conference press release. They didn't tell us anything we
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:23.200]   didn't already know, right? Nope. Nope. It really was. I mean, what happened today is essentially that
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:28.400]   the press got invited. We already knew there were developers who were invited. The press got
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:34.880]   invited today. We did not get an invite here at Macbreak Weekly, but Jason, I imagine you did.
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.400]   Yeah, I'll be there. Yeah.
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:43.040]   Micah went last year, did not get invited this year. We wrote a cart together.
[00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:50.880]   You wrote a cart? Yeah, golf cart. That wasn't that event. That was a different event. But we did go
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:57.920]   and yeah, they were like, "Oh, we'll just drive you over to do this podcast on a golf cart." And
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:03.920]   like, "Well, how do you say no when Apple offers to just shepherd you around their campus?"
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.520]   I think that's fun. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:07.520]   And then you wave at everybody as you go by.
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:11.680]   That was great. Did it have leather seats? Was it like a special golf cart?
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.800]   No, it was not like an Apple golf cart. It was just a golf cart.
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:21.760]   It didn't let you use the bikes. Yeah. No, no, no. I mean, again, a golf cart driven by an
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:25.440]   Apple employee taking us where we were allowed to go. It's supposed to be clear.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.440]   We don't want to be handing you bikes. You might be showing up in the wheel.
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.000]   A bike? It's like free range. You could just go anywhere.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.600]   Yeah. Exactly. Yeah.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:37.760]   What's the gaming term? It was on rails. Not open.
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:41.440]   Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Because if you get on a bike, they got to like take a metal pole and
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.840]   stick it in the spokes and knock you over and get you out of there.
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:48.080]   I think they have those little auto-locking bikes. Like, "Nope, but we can't go there."
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.720]   Not in that zone. It just goes that way.
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.520]   Yeah. There were a couple of people who are posting,
[00:08:53.520 --> 00:09:00.240]   developers who got invites to posting about how the broad sort of welcome party schedule
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:05.840]   includes, of course, the keynote, of course, a lunch. The platform state of the union,
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:11.120]   all that stuff is like traditionally every single year, but followed by a special
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:18.400]   tour of Apple Park and then a quote special evening activity that you won't want to miss
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:26.400]   on the Google and a smaller event at the Apple Developer Center on Tuesday to
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.560]   quote discuss some of the latest announcements.
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:33.200]   Gosh. No. I'm not going to check my Gmail. I'm not.
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:36.480]   I know I didn't invite it. I'm not going to give you the satisfaction, Apple.
[00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:41.360]   That sounds like fun. These will be tested for Pink Eye before the Tuesday event.
[00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.560]   You will be going to that, Jason, I'm sure.
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.800]   Well, that's a developer event.
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.960]   Oh, you don't get to go to the concert.
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:55.280]   It's unclear. Well, it's unclear, right? Maybe not. What is it?
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:59.840]   It's a mystery. Like, they don't specify. I mean, maybe it's been a while, Leo, but like,
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:06.560]   they're not really forthcoming about it. Yeah. Yeah. I wouldn't know on a Monday morning.
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:10.160]   And then what happens after that is the... It's the... But it keeps you on your toes.
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.680]   It's the wonder of the mystery. Is there a little Pandora, a Lockett,
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:20.800]   a golf cart trinket attached to your maybe a little hint? No. This is the invite,
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:26.000]   which I'll have to defer to Matthew Panzerino at TechCrunch for his copy.
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.400]   You're invited, RSVP, to join us in person to watch the keynote address kicking off at
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:36.080]   WWDC at Apple Park June 5th, 10 a.m. Have fun. It's the same art that they use for all of the
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:41.760]   WWDC stuff this year. Oh, is it? Nothing new to be gleaned. Yeah. It's the Apple Park ring and
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:46.800]   its colors. And some people have said that it also suggests that it's the lenses, the different...
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:54.800]   Oh, the periscope lenses. The lenses on the iPhone 15. No, of the lenses in the headset.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.960]   Oh, the headset. What's that?
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:02.080]   It's a product that you're convinced is not going to happen.
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:07.520]   That one. Totally happened. That going to happen. Actually, it's not me. It's Glenn
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:11.280]   Fleishman, who's... Glenn Fleishman was surprised that they're going to release a headset. I wonder
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:20.080]   where he's been. Anyway, anyway. So I can... I haven't checked my junk mail folder yet. So
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:26.240]   maybe it just got kicked into junk mail. I'll wait until I put a focus on the show. So I'll
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:31.280]   pick that up. Yeah. Look afterward. Yeah. We have been introduced to the 2023 finalists
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:35.840]   for the Apple Design Awards, which will be announced also on that Monday, I think, right?
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:45.280]   Do you want to know in the inclusivity category and universe, passenger assistance,
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:53.680]   finding Hannah, ancient board game collection, and stitch. Those seem like delightful and fun
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:12:01.280]   apps, but there is a separate category for those. Duolingo, cream, chantlings, pocket card, jockey,
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:07.840]   ride on, not words, which you recommended, Jason, and I'm still using. Love it. And after place,
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:16.640]   interaction shuffles by Pinterest. Can you win twice? Or so these have to be new, right?
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:22.080]   Or no, I don't know. So I don't recognize a lot of these titles.
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:26.960]   Tile guide, charts and tables, flighty, which I do use as a subscription program.
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:30.560]   Yeah, I think that was a pick at one point. That's a great tool. Yeah.
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:38.640]   Atonmatoys, railbound and kimono cats. One of my favorites. For social impact, Duolingo again,
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:47.520]   Sago mini first words, headspace meditation app, hind sight, endling, extinction is forever,
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:54.640]   and be carbonized visuals and graphics. Any distance, gentler, street health fitness,
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:13:01.440]   reveal Diablo, mortal, the game that costs you forever, resident,
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:08.960]   vehicle village, endling again, innovation, camo, yeah, camo studio, swing vision,
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:15.120]   another pick, rise, energy and sleep tracker. I'm familiar with that resident evil village.
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:22.720]   Play that briefly. Oh, um, stitch or stitch stitch. Yeah, that's an nominated twice. Yeah.
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:27.360]   And Marvel snap. What is, let's look at one of my pitch Marvel snap. Yeah.
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:34.400]   Stitch it to puzzle out. So stitch you have to sew according to the numbers digitally.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:37.360]   And then it's a Chicago puzzle.
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:43.920]   Yeah. Those were, those are always fun because they're not necessarily, they're certainly not
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:48.400]   the most popular. They're maybe not even apps that have gotten a lot of traction. They really
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:52.960]   are the ones that are, they're trying to, they're trying to reward developers who are most creative
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:59.520]   and or support most of what Apple has been promoting as here is what a proper and creative and
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:05.440]   innovative Mac app or iPhone app should look like. So it's not, it's, it's, it's, it's not like the,
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:09.120]   the cable A. So awards or the, the Grammy awards, their paragons of Apple.
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:13.360]   For sure. Yes. Feel tea. They've been the name.
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:16.480]   They've been the me anyway. There's the design and work.
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:20.640]   But they're great stuff. Yeah. They're, they're, they're always, they're always,
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:24.080]   a lot of apps that I've never heard of. And then when I try them out, they're like, Oh my God,
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:28.400]   how come I don't hurt this? This is so cool. Well, this is for a good example. And the first one
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:37.760]   I mentioned, Morse assistant for deaf blind people. So you can communicate through vibrations.
[00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:44.080]   That's interesting. Oh, and is Helen Keller's assistant. That's right. She drew on her, on her
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:51.040]   hand, right? A gate, deaf blind gateway to the outside world powered by Morse code and iPhone
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:57.600]   haptics. What an interesting idea. Yeah. Yeah. And it looks very pretty too. Yeah. Nicely done.
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:03.520]   That's very cool. So that's just a little sampler of what you can expect.
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:12.240]   Oh, Apple is now appealing. Let's see. They've, it's complicated. The EU tax. Remember,
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:21.280]   Apple one. So I saw Ireland is appealing or the EU is appealing. Apple one in this overseas tax in,
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:30.960]   in Ireland. The back taxes of 30 billion Irish dollars, pounds, euros. That's what it is.
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:40.000]   13 billion euros. Apple one in 2020 after insisting in 2020, it would appeal the
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.840]   European Commission has finally petitioned three years later, the Court of Justice of the
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:52.880]   European Union to get that 13 bill. The contention was that Ireland extended preferential treatment
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:59.360]   to Apple that was illegal in the EU. And so Apple should have paid that tax and
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:05.600]   the courts did not say that. They said, no, Apple doesn't know that tax, which does seem kind of
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:15.600]   unfair to Apple. And Ireland said we didn't want it. Yeah. Forgive them. We never asked for it. Yeah.
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:22.160]   In 2020, July 2020, the EU's second highest court ruled in favor of Apple and Ireland,
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:29.120]   saying that it was not an unlawful tax preference, but they're going to appeal it.
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:36.400]   Apple said we paid her taxes. We paid every penny that we were legally required to. We paid
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:45.840]   every penny. All right. I think it's time for hands on. Let's get hands on Jason Snell,
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:52.560]   hands on the hard body. I like to call it easy now. You have you have for a week
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:58.480]   very stealthily been using Final Cut Pro for the iPad and logic for the iPad.
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:06.320]   It's true. It's true. Yeah. Barger just dropped. And what can I say? Logic. So, okay. A lot of
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:10.720]   podcasters out there who are Mac users have been using logic to edit their podcasts. I use
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:15.760]   logic to edit my podcast on the Mac. And they are very curious about what this mean. They could
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:21.520]   edit those podcasts on the iPad or round trip them between the Mac and the iPad. And I'm here to
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:26.400]   tell you two things about that. One is you could always edit a podcast on the iPad. The app's called
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:30.400]   Fairrite Recording Studio. It's excellent. It's made for podcasters and you should use it.
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:36.640]   And two, logic on the Mac is like, and I said this, I said this, I think last week,
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:40.960]   it's like an app that we can use, but it's like we're using it wrong. It's not for us. It's not
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:45.360]   made for us. It's made for music apps. It's a music app. It's not for editing music apps.
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:49.200]   Speech particularly. Exactly. Right. I mean, it's not you have to you can set it up to do it,
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:53.120]   but it's like it really wants to have musical bars and a tempo and you can kind of hide that
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:58.000]   stuff. When Apple built logic for the iPad, what do they do? Well, they emphasize what it's for,
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.280]   which is music. It's got even fewer of the features that podcasters might use. And while you can
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:10.720]   edit spoken word things in logic for the iPad, don't, don't try. It's really unpleasant.
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:16.400]   You can do it, but it's like there are so many better options. Fairrite is a much better option.
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:22.800]   And like even I tried to bring in a project that I brought that a podcast project that I built on
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:28.720]   the Mac to the iPad and it said, sorry, although this is a logic project, it is not saved using
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:34.080]   the music grid. So although they talk about round trip, it actually is for very specific kinds of
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:39.120]   projects, which are music projects. Otherwise, it won't even open a logic project from the Mac.
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:46.080]   So there's a lot right. So anyway, final cut, I think is way more interesting, even though when
[00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:53.040]   the announcements came out, we were all like, Oh, final cut is a dozen round trip and its limited
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:55.680]   feature set and doesn't have all the features of the Mac. It's going to be disappointing and
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:00.080]   logic's going to be exciting. Logic has more limitations compared to the Mac version than you
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:05.360]   might think. If you're a podcaster anyway, final cut is really good. It needs to be better.
[00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:10.160]   There's some things they could do to make it better if you're using it just with touch.
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:15.200]   They are things they could do to make it better if you're using Apple Pencil. But I was able to,
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:19.280]   once I got the hang of it and they've done some very clever things to move some stuff around in
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:23.360]   the interface, I can add it pretty quickly. I think that it's got a huge amount of potential,
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:31.440]   even if there's stuff that apps like Fairwright learned a while ago that it needs to learn like
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:34.720]   little multi touch gestures and things to make it a little faster. Here's a bug you found.
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:40.400]   You dragged a video track and it flipped it upside down. Well, that was right before crash. First,
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:44.960]   it flips it upside down and that's like the sign of a devil. And then if you continue to use it,
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:49.840]   then it just crashes entirely. And I found that a lot. I had trouble dragging things around sometimes.
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:55.040]   Other times it worked fine. I did capture the moment where it inverted the waveform right before
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:20:00.000]   it crashed. Very nicely done. Yeah, you just think that. Yeah, I mean, it's a 1.0. But I feel like
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.960]   they could add some niceties and it would be something. And in terms of the power of the iPad,
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:10.320]   I mean, we're talking about M1 and M2 devices. They are on the Mac. They're just fine. Guess what?
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:15.440]   They're just fine on the iPad too in terms of editing and exporting, encoding video, all of those
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:21.520]   things. It just works. So strangely though, yeah, it's optimized for touch. Doesn't have a lot of
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:28.480]   multi touch niceties and the keyboard shortcuts are actually pretty good and can help speed things
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:32.800]   along because, you know, if you want to split a clip or you want to delete a clip really fast
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:38.800]   or you want to toggle play or pause on the iPad with touch, you've got to like do a tap or two
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:44.000]   in a particular place. And if you've got a keyboard, it's just what you're used to,
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:49.600]   which is press the spacebar or command B to blade the clip or delete key to delete the clip.
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:55.280]   It's very familiar when you're using that. So like, I feel like they're really close and that
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:59.680]   this is only going to get better. And if I honestly, if I were to edit a podcast on the iPad and I
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:05.280]   wasn't allowed to use Fairwright, I'd probably use Final Cut not logic because that's, I'm not
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:09.040]   a musician. And that's not what it's for. It's not, it's not their fault, right? Like that's what
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:13.840]   that app is for it. We were just sneaking in there and trying to use it for things it wasn't intended
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:17.360]   for. But Final Cut, I was really impressed. I think there's a lot of room for it to grow,
[00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:21.920]   but I think it's a good start. And if you're a musician, you might have a different opinion of
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:28.640]   logic for them. Right? Like, I mean, I can't wait to see what musically inclined people say
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:35.440]   about logic on the iPad, because in, I've seen enough of logic to know like, I'm very impressed
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:40.400]   with what they put in there. But also it's literally all the features that I turn off on Mac.
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:45.680]   So I'm not, I'm not going to give the answer there. I look forward to the official musician
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:52.000]   reviews of logic. Yeah, if you're editing audio, they're far better tools. Fairwright's a great one,
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.200]   but they're far better tools, even on the Mac. So it's kind of, but you know what, you have logic.
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:02.560]   The difference is you paid once for logic, probably, if you're like me years ago, a very long time ago.
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:07.520]   Yeah, this would be different. You'd have to pay either $5 a month or $50 a year to use it. So
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:10.960]   it's not right. It's 20 bucks. I've had users.
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:18.240]   And out the door done. Actually, you say 30 in your article, 30 or 20.
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.720]   Is it 30? Oh, yeah. Okay. So it changes. It's free.
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:25.760]   And then there's an app purchase that must be 30. And then what they do is actually you get
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:29.360]   those features forever. And then the next time he does the complicated thing that's actually,
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:34.800]   I think the best way to do software purchases in the app store, but it's complicated, which is,
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:39.840]   you know, the next version will come out and they'll be an in-app purchase for existing users
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:44.560]   that'll be smaller, but new users will have to pay more. And it's like, this is why everybody's
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:49.200]   given up and done subscriptions. But the guy who just fair, right, has not done that. So it's free
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:53.280]   to use. And then if you want to unlock the premium features, it's, yeah, I guess a $30 in
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:57.680]   app purchase, still a bargain, like the best bargain in a non-linear audio editor that you're
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:03.280]   ever going to see on any platform, I think, other than free. Above free, it's pretty, $30 is pretty
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:09.680]   cheap. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's the pricing, $30. You can see it, right? It gets complicated.
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:15.040]   It's like Fairight 2 Pro, Fairight 3 Pro. Like, this is why people don't do this. This is why they
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:20.720]   just do subs instead, because the app store is so unfriendly to developers who want to
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:27.840]   do a traditional kind of upgrade model. Yeah. Well, good. I think, is there a trial period?
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.640]   No. You can't just try before you buy it. Yes, 30-day trial.
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:39.680]   Oh, there is. Oh, good. Yeah. Okay. Fantastic. Alex, did your people have anything to say about?
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:48.000]   Not everyone, all of a sudden, I'm still trying to download it. It came out today.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   One thing that Apple is trying, I think, trying to prove is that they're not giving themselves any
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.080]   special treatment, because you can't even search for it on the store. What? Like, you search for
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:01.120]   Final Cut and like, no. And so I finally found the article about Final Cut and then I said,
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:04.720]   "Oh, no, you have to upgrade." So I've been slowly trying to get my iPad ready to download it.
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:11.040]   So we haven't. I know a couple people have been playing with it. So fully biased,
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:14.480]   who's in our office hours, was doing like a live stream of people who's going to edit a music
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:20.640]   video this morning, but I was prepping for the show. I didn't see it, but he's... So I think a
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:24.400]   bunch of people are jumping into it. I think it's going to be really interesting. There's a lot of
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:31.840]   curiosity as to whether this code eventually becomes Final Cut. Are we going to just see
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:41.520]   this become the desktop version that eventually is just installed once on other apps that are M1,
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:45.840]   that they'll just install onto a Mac Mini or a computer or on your iPad and
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:54.000]   just one code base, two years from now, or something like that, whether they're just going to keep
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:00.800]   evolving the code. But it looks interesting. I think that I'm still trying to figure out where
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:05.360]   I'll use either one of these, because I need all the features that generally are in there
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:13.680]   for both of them. One question for Jason, does it support the plugins? Is it part third party plugins?
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:20.960]   So the story there is varied, right? There are audio plugins that are supported in iPadOS,
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:28.240]   like audio units. In terms of Final Cut, Apple's given a kind of a hazy story about plugins where
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:33.360]   there's like they've got content and they've got that there's something coming. I feel like
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:36.880]   it's very much like there's a little post-it note on that part of the product that's like check
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:42.320]   back later. So I honestly, I think that it's all in the planning stages, but that they launched this
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:46.400]   product. Obviously, it's like they just decided that now was the time to get it out there and now
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:52.640]   they can start that process. But so like on the audio side, if somebody's released audio units for
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:57.600]   iPad and a few people have, you can use those as audio plugins. And then on the... Does the
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:02.320]   Isotrope stuff work? And in Monetope does not believe that the iPad is a platform. So no.
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:08.640]   Like I would love that because that's what I use. I don't think I can do a podcast without
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:14.640]   RX. I know. I agree with you. I have pre-processed and the answer for people who wonder how do I
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:18.400]   edit on iPad. The answer is I pre-process all my audio files on the Mac and then I send them to
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:24.080]   my iPad for editing because Isotope is not on the iPad. And then yeah, so on the Final Cut side,
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:28.480]   like I think they want there to be a lot more content on both of those apps actually in terms of
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:32.800]   available stuff from Apple and from third parties, which would include plugins. But
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:38.240]   you know, it's early days for that. But they did. It was a couple of years ago they put audio units
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:44.080]   three on the platform and I have some that I can use inside Fairight and other places and
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:49.360]   like Fab filters make some pretty good like compressors for the iPad. And they work great,
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:54.640]   right? It's just that you're if you rely on a particular vendor like Isotope and they seem to
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:27:00.480]   be completely clueless about the existence of the iPad, right? And it's not so great, right?
[00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:04.160]   And that's where we are with. I hope this might actually be a spurred Isotope to finally get
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:08.640]   with the program. I was surprised. I thought there was a standard plugin architecture.
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:12.480]   It's audio units three. It is standard, but you have to in order to sell it on the iPad,
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:16.960]   you actually have to make a Lisa Rapper app and put it in the App Store.
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:21.120]   Isotope does sell in the App Store. They only sell it via their own thing. They've got like a
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:26.800]   proprietary subscription management thing on the Mac that you have to run. And it's a whole,
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:30.400]   like I think there's a cultural problem at Isotope, but I hope they change.
[00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:37.600]   Also, there was a there's a Final Cut. A new Final Cut was released for the Mac as well.
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:41.040]   So, you know, there's an update to that. Is that for speech parity or?
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:47.440]   I don't think so. I think it does allow some versions of round tripping, you know, so you import
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:52.080]   a project. You can't send it to the iPad, but you can take it from the iPad. So, you start a project
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:59.280]   on your iPad. I think the iPad has less features always than the desktop version. So, you can bring
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:03.120]   your iPad version in and continue it, which is kind of cool because that means you're going to be on
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:07.280]   the road. You shoot a bunch of stuff, you start working on it, and then you come home and you
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:14.160]   dump it into the full version of Final Cut and go from there. I think it's got also some HDR stuff,
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:20.480]   some new titles and effects and screen removal, a scene removal mask to remove backgrounds,
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:23.680]   which I haven't played, but yeah. So, that it's funny because those features got announced for
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:27.040]   the iPad and people are like, "Oh, those aren't in the Mac. Is there going to be a bifurcation?"
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:30.880]   And the answer is, "No, no. There's an update today on the Mac that adds all those features.
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:34.800]   Those are all there." You mentioned HDR, I will say, one of the really interesting uses
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:43.040]   of this Final Cut on the iPad is I think a lot of people, I mean, if you've got a MacBook Pro,
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:48.560]   then you've got a pretty good HDR screen. But if you don't, or if you're out in the field,
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:56.080]   having an iPad that's got that full-on HDR display and iPad Pro, 12.9, while you're editing HDR video
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:01.680]   or looking at HDR video, that's pretty powerful, right? In your hand, you've got that HDR preview
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:08.000]   monitor that's also an editor that you can then take back home and import into the Mac side.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.480]   That's a pretty good story. Yeah, that's great. I mean, when I'm testing HDR,
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:18.720]   one of the first places I look is an iPad. I just open it up when I'm, you know, we're slowly moving
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:25.360]   office hours to HDR. And so, I'm constantly opening it up and watching the stream to see if it's
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:29.680]   actually turning out. And so, being able to see it when you're, especially in the field, it's kind of
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:34.080]   amazing. Yeah, my iPad Pro is the best screen I've got in the entire house. And whenever I'm editing
[00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:37.840]   something, a photo that's taking me like two or three days to edit, I'm really proud of it.
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:42.800]   The last thing I check is I'm just going to open it up on my iPad because if it looks good there,
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:46.800]   I'm not going to accept anybody's complaints that doesn't look good on their screen because
[00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:53.840]   you need to get a better screen. Kieser nerd in our discord says he did not have trouble finding
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:58.960]   either app. So, I think maybe they've updated the search index now so it's a little easier to find
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:03.360]   it. He also answered a question I had. One of the things I loved about logic on the Mac was it had
[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:11.280]   all sorts of gigabytes of instruments. He says when he installed logic on the iPad, it prompted him
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:16.640]   to install three different musical instrument packages, classical, electronic, and hip hop
[00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:22.640]   about 600 megabytes. That's still far short of the total available instrument packages, but it shows
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:26.560]   you can install them, right? That's part of that post-it note, right? You can choose to install those
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:34.080]   at launch and then you can choose which ones. Apple says more to come, basically, from Apple and
[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:40.560]   also from third parties, but it's day one of these, essentially. So, there will be more.
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:46.080]   And when Alex and I are complaining about Isotope, I really do believe that all our complaints about
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:52.400]   Apple not being present on its own pro iPad platform with its pro apps. Now that it's there,
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:56.560]   I hope one of the side effects is going to be that some developers that kind of poo pooed
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:01.440]   and are like, "Okay, all right. Now that you've got logic and file, all right, we'll get in the
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:07.840]   app store." I hope that happens. I hope so too. It depends on how important Apple decides
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:13.680]   how important they decide that having that feature is because if developers don't move over,
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:17.920]   sometimes Apple just develops it for them. Yeah. Hey, we need this. So is the threat.
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:23.760]   Yeah. Or they promote another, suddenly, something that is your direct competitor is being promoted
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:28.160]   on the part of the platform that you're not supporting. And so, those are the kind of things
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:33.680]   that happen when you don't pay attention. Well, it's available now. You can download a Final Cut Pro
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:42.880]   for the iPad if you have an M1 or M2 iPad Pro or if you have an 11-inch M1 iPad Air, it does require
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:49.520]   the M processor, right? I think that was- Yes. Yeah. So, and somebody in their chat, I'm saying,
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:54.160]   "I have a regular iPad and I don't see it in the search index, so maybe they are filtering it out
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:32:00.080]   unless you're compatible." Let's take a little break more to come with Alex Lindsey and Iainakko.
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:07.040]   Jason Sneller showed today, brought to you by Melissa, the address experts from forms on a web
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:13.600]   page to check out. Customer data comes into your company from many different sources,
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:18.960]   which I'm sad to say whether it's a customer service rep entering it or your customer
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:26.960]   his or herself, that leaves room for errors and for missing information. But Melissa can solve that.
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:34.240]   Here comes the personator. With Melissa's personator consumer tool, you can get a superior snapshot

[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:44.720]   better targeting and marketing campaigns, and maybe even most importantly helps you with fraud
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:51.840]   detection. Personator consumer not only appends data but also verifies name, address, and contact
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:57.280]   information as well as date of birth, social security numbers for a quick identity verification
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:02.880]   check. It also enriches data to add geographic and demographic information for you. So, not only
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:07.920]   are you verifying your customer, you're able to provide them the best possible experience
[00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:12.960]   with your business. When you have highly specific demographics, you can even personalize your
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:18.000]   marketing, finding the best leads and offering the best service or deal for your specific
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:24.720]   customer in their specific situation. With Melissa, you gain access to appendable demographics.
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:30.480]   Listen to the list and this is not even the whole list, but things like deceased information,
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:36.320]   occupation, presence of children, number of adults, marital status. Are they a homeowner?
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:43.920]   Are they a renter? What is the range of household income? The length of the residence in the home,
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:49.280]   all of that is available through personator consumer. Melissa's address verification tools

[00:34:51.760 --> 00:35:02.160]   It was a very big quarter for switchers. This is a report from KUP, C-I-R-P. I don't know how you pronounce
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:08.160]   that. KUP. After a report last week about how long Apple users are keeping their iPhones,
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:14.320]   KUP is out today with another study digging into how many new iPhone buyers in the US are coming
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:20.560]   from Google's platform. This is from 9-5 Mac. The new survey shows Apple is attracting the most
[00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:30.000]   switchers from Android. It's seen in the past five years. So the steep price, not scaring people off,
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.280]   although Apple does now offer a variety of price points. The largest number of
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:45.120]   folks switching to iPhone in the last five years, 15% of new iPhone owners saying my last phone was
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:54.960]   an Android. It's up 4% over last year, 5% higher than 2020 and 2021. 2% of new iPhone buyers say they
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:36:02.640]   came from a basic phone. It's so basic. Or other, or were the first time smartphones.
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:08.320]   It's a kin. Yeah, a kin. That's very basic. Yeah, you know, I would like to have a kin.
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:13.680]   So I don't know what that means. What do you think that tell, what does that say about the market?
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:19.680]   It probably says that Apple's doing a really good job reaching into countries that have been
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:24.240]   primarily Android based. That means that they're selling more phones in India. They're selling more
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:30.560]   phones in southern Asia, South Asia. All these, it's not, I don't think there's so much
[00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:37.440]   all of a sudden convincing a lot of people in the United States of America to dump their Samsung
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:45.280]   phones for iPhones. But it really does show that a market that they were under had had a reduced
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:50.240]   ability to compete in. Now they're figuring out we're building phones that a comply with local laws
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:55.200]   that are that make sense for the consumers in that market. And that's they're seeing the numbers
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:59.840]   to prove that, hey, they're they're they continue to find people who have who do not have iPhones
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:06.800]   yet. And they're going to get them. Yeah, I think it's also, I don't know, is this wrong to say?
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:12.160]   Not on this show, but that the Android phone is the phone you get when either you don't care
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:16.880]   or you don't get to choose. And that if you get to choose, you get the iPhone.
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:23.440]   I actually think that it's if you don't care or you care a lot. So I think that the thing is,
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:28.160]   is that people who buy the low end ones don't care. They just want to phone my mom is like that.
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:33.680]   The then the high end ones are the people who are really particularly, they want they have very
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:38.080]   specific needs. So they want to push, you know, they want to customize it in a way that Apple's
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:42.160]   not going to let you customize it. So I think that Android does have the two ends of that.
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:47.920]   Apple has folks that just wanted to work and they're not as I think a lot of times the high end
[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:54.240]   Android user is much more passionate about what the phone can do than an iPhone user. You know,
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:58.320]   they're they really want to push the outer envelope. They want to do those things with an iPhone
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:03.040]   user. I think a lot of times they just want to be easy. Like it's like, if it's not quite, if the
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:07.120]   camera isn't quite the same as the Android ads, but all the other stuff works really well.
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:10.720]   I don't have to think about it that much. I think that a lot of the a lot an average iPhone user
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:14.720]   just wants it to be in the background and not in the foreground. And I think that that's a
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:18.960]   distinction between, but I think the high end Android user is probably more particular than.
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:22.400]   No, that's that's convincing. In fact, Galia in our chat room, who's Israeli
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:27.200]   says she buys Android phones because she can customize them. She can you can you can fiddle
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:30.080]   with them. You can tweak them. Yeah. Yeah. It also feels like we're in a real,
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:36.000]   you know, there is such a fight for market share and a fight for mind share between
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.400]   iOS and Android. And I feel like we're in a place now where
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:42.640]   iOS and Android are here. They're not going anywhere. And there's kind of an
[00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:46.720]   ebb and flow that's going to happen. We're different markets. Like Andy said,
[00:38:46.720 --> 00:38:49.920]   different markets are going to come in that are not very iPhone and they're going to get a little
[00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:54.080]   more iPhone and that'll be good for Apple and that there are other markets where it's going to be.
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:58.800]   Is there a hot phone, right? Like, is there a hot phone or a hot phone maker that drives sales
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:03.520]   to one way or the other? I think Apple is always talking about, I mean, in the US where Apple's
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:08.000]   maybe over 50% market share, it's a little bit harder for them to pick up users. But like,
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.920]   this is not a scenario where Apple is so dominant in any country that they can't pick up market share.
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:17.920]   So they'll pick it up here and there and then they'll lose it here and there, right? And I think
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:22.880]   that that's that's sort of the steady state of of the smartphone market we seem to be in now where
[00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:26.880]   it's like, you know, you pick your poison. And I think there's truth to it. There are people who,
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:32.320]   there are two reasons, like, I know people who have Android phones and one reason is that they
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:36.400]   hate Apple and the other reason is they looked at the price of the deal on the Android phone and
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:40.240]   the iPhone and they're like, this is way cheaper and I don't care, right? Like, because if it's way
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:46.240]   cheaper and you and you do care, you'll find a way to get to an iPhone, I think. But if you don't care,
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:51.600]   then then obviously you can get a much better deal down at the lower end of the line, not even
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:58.240]   the low low, but just lower end with an Android phone. So I don't know. It feels like, I know they
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:04.160]   compete, but like, it doesn't feel like it's just sort of a different world. Not a war anymore.
[00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:09.680]   No, the one that I think concerns Google the most is the fact that the so many kids under it under
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:16.480]   18 are using iPhones. Like it is, it is a, it's like a crank. I don't know what I saw another
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:20.240]   report this week. It was like 88% or something like that. It's a really high number and I talked to
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:25.280]   my kids about it and it's, you know, it's the bubble.
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:26.160]   One of the reasons-
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:29.440]   It's like what Andy talks about. It's like no one wants to be, no one in high, no one in school
[00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:32.560]   wants to have a green bubble. Like, because everyone's like, oh, don't include them in the
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:34.320]   group. Like, then they have to go to snap.
[00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:40.400]   It's also though that that generation lacks the antipathy to Apple that older people sometimes
[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:47.600]   have my daughter 30 hates Apple. And the reason she has an Android phone is because she refuses
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:49.840]   to buy an Apple device.
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:51.040]   And why does she hate Apple?
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:56.320]   I don't know if there's anything Apple can do about this because some of what people don't like
[00:40:56.320 --> 00:41:03.920]   about Apple is Apple users, not Apple. There's this sense, the guy who has the notch carved into his
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:10.960]   air. There's this sense that Apple, the cult of Mac, is out of weirdos and out of control and
[00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:19.360]   that kind of thing. I think that that doesn't happen under 18 so much. That's a little kind of
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:21.120]   leftover from the old days.
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:26.240]   I mean, that's been there since the 70s. I feel like on one level, and you can point,
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:30.320]   I think some people point to it and some people ignore it. And certainly people talk about the
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:34.880]   cult of Apple and the cult of Mac and they've been doing that forever. And I just kind of roll
[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:39.840]   my eyes at those people like, you know, like what you like and dislike what you don't like. And I
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:45.920]   think kids, even today, I mean, I've got two kids in college now. And, you know, I, there's still
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:52.960]   ways to line it up. I mean, for gamers, you know, if you're a gamer, the Mac is never going to be
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:58.320]   on your agenda. But maybe, but then for your smartphone, maybe you don't care. And so you see a lot of,
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:03.680]   I know a lot of my son's friends are, they got a Windows PC for gaming and they got an iPhone.
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:06.880]   And that's just how they live. And I hate to break it to Mac users. And I know this is Mac
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:13.840]   break weekly. But if you do the math, it's impossible for there to be more iPhone users who are Mac
[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:18.240]   users than there are iPhone users who are Windows users, just like that sink in.
[00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:26.640]   Right. My son has an iPhone and he just finished building his own PC. So he's, you know, and which I
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:33.360]   probably supplied the hardware for him to put it together. And so, you know, I definitely
[00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:36.560]   agree that and he's, and he got it specifically because he wants to do gaming.
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:40.480]   I think Microsoft's aware of the fact that there are a lot of iPhone users because this week
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:45.760]   Windows announced the your phone or phone link, I guess they call it now,
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:51.440]   for that will work for iOS. It's not as complete as the Android version, probably because of
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:56.400]   limitations on iOS. But I tried it on Windows weekly last week and I set up my iPhone to work
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:02.480]   on my Windows PC. And you can see messages. You can get notifications. You can send messages
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:08.080]   you know, effectively you're using Apple's messages on your on your Windows PC.
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:15.280]   You can even make calls. So the only thing you really, it doesn't do is the running applications.
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:19.840]   You can on Android, you can actually run an Android application windowed on your Windows PC
[00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:23.440]   running off your phone. And I can see why that's not possible with an iPhone.
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:27.840]   Well, that just shows how different, what a different business Microsoft is. And they are,
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:33.920]   they are the gears and the grease, the power is business. So it's 100% in their best interest to
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:39.680]   make sure that they can support a bring your own device strategy if a company wants to support that.
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:47.760]   So it's just it's so hard to compare the two directly in any sort of way, shape or form
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:51.600]   these days because it really does depend on what environment are these people in,
[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:56.160]   what country are they in, what kind of money they have to spend. I'm really keen to see this
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:44:03.440]   generation of kids who has, who have iPhones. How, how long are they going to, are they going to
[00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:10.240]   continue to be loyal Apple iPhone users when they get well out of college and now they have to buy
[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:14.960]   their first phone themselves. Are they going to, are they going to settle for something that is
[00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:19.440]   still an iPhone, but not the top of the line or they're, or are they going to say, you know what,
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:24.400]   for the amount of money I'm going to spend on the middle tier iPhone, I could get a central, I could
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:30.160]   get something that is, that is flagship grade in a pixel line or in a Samsung line. So I don't,
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:33.520]   I don't know, but I don't, I don't, I'm not telling them what to do. I'm just, I'm, it's,
[00:44:33.520 --> 00:44:38.240]   it's an interesting piece of sociology to examine. Yeah, it'd be interesting. I think the hard part
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:41.600]   with all of these things is the lock in on either side. So you really have to make a choice. I mean,
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:45.360]   I think that if you grow up on an iPhone, it's really hard to, you got a whole bunch of apps.
[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:49.360]   It's not just the cost of the computer and the cost of them, the phone, but the cost of everything
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:53.360]   else that's related to it and all, you know, comfort and everything else. So I think that it's a,
[00:44:53.360 --> 00:44:56.880]   I mean, that's why everyone's, that's why there's a lot of talking, a lot of articles about
[00:44:56.880 --> 00:45:02.160]   the number of kids that are using one platform is that like it's, it's pretty hard to get people
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:08.240]   to reverse it, reverse trajectory at that point. Yeah, but to, to a great extent, so longs it can
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:15.120]   run TikTok, so longs it can run a bunch of popular apps that are multi platform. A lot of people are
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:21.600]   pretty good. It's, I don't think, I don't think that's as big a deal, even, even on my, even on my
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:28.240]   MacBook, even when I'm not really thinking about being platform agnostic, it's really, really hard
[00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:35.200]   to get me so locked in that that would become a really, really big, really big disincentive to
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:40.720]   switch from under the other. The thing that really is a big disincentive is just that three weeks
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:45.840]   it will take not to relearn something, but just to retrain my thumb that no, that's not how you,
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:50.640]   how you switch from one app to another. I know exactly how you do it, but I'm still, I'm still
[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:55.040]   stuck to doing it, doing it the old way. So as long as people have something that works,
[00:45:55.040 --> 00:45:58.960]   they're kind of apt to stick with it. I understand, Annie, because your thumb is really untrainable.
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:04.560]   You have a very, it's an African, it's unbroken, it's untrained. It's not a yes thumb. You know,
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:09.920]   that's why I have it on staff to challenge me, you know, to be that, be that, that, that, that,
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:14.160]   that flying the ointment that gets us to rethink our own school strategy. Yes, he's a pain of the
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:21.360]   butt, but you know what? We need more thumbs like that. He's a wild thumb. Hey, you know what,
[00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:28.640]   good news, if you are an iPhone user, France is fighting, fighting for you. Yeah. To save your
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:34.720]   iPhone from an early death, that's the kind of cookie wired headline. Actually, this is an
[00:46:34.720 --> 00:46:39.440]   Ars Technica article from Wired. So they're all kind of nasty. It's all the same. French
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:46.000]   prosecutors have launched an investigation into the scourge of planned obsolescence,
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:52.480]   says Morgan Mieker. Actually, I am, I'm with them. What they really want is at least that you
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:57.120]   could change your battery for crying out loud, but it's all right to repair.
[00:46:57.120 --> 00:47:08.240]   This is a article quoting Alexander Alexandra Azeek, CEO of Zirappare Academy,
[00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:13.040]   which is a renowned research and training group according to Wired that runs the Toulouse
[00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:20.560]   technicians workshop. Every time a new iPhone's released, his team funds in the
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:27.440]   other part that has been locked to work only with this specific Apple device. First, it was a
[00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:32.480]   cheap one. The mother bald, then the east of Palsman. This isn't like a government agency,
[00:47:32.480 --> 00:47:36.000]   right? This is just a, I don't know, a press release and ours picked it up. I get it.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:41.600]   That's what it is. This is a, no, this is, it's a little bit, it's a little bit more in depth
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:46.320]   than that. It's, there is a Paris prosecutor who has decided to take action. It's, it's, well,
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:51.840]   it's, it's more along the lines of a senator who has proposed a bill and is, and, and you know,
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:55.120]   it's not going to, it's going to go into committee and that's going to die in committee, but this
[00:47:55.120 --> 00:48:00.080]   senator decided to write this bill so they can, they can get the message out there that they are
[00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:06.320]   very much for this thing. Although the thing is, this is France and it's a very, very socialist
[00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:13.200]   country and they're a lot, and they have done, from our perspective, goofy or things, then order,
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:17.440]   order a phone company to say, hi, you've got to re-engineer your entire platform because
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:22.560]   we feel as though you're abusing the power of the people to do what they need to do in order to,
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:27.440]   in order to tolerate their phones very, very well. So the contention is that Apple essentially
[00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:34.240]   has built into its phones planned obsolescence because you're not using standard parts. It's not
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:44.400]   easy to fix these phones. And so it's a Parisian prosecutor who's investigating. I don't, I don't
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:47.600]   know if that's going to be, he's delegated the investigation to France's department of
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:54.080]   competition consumer affairs and fraud prevention. They could find Apple. And in fact,
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:58.640]   France was the one that introduced that repairability scoring system.
[00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:06.080]   And they're also on the case for locking serial numbers. Basically having to, you can't just simply
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:10.880]   buy a battery or buy a screen or buy a camera sensor and plug it in there. It has to be coded
[00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:16.880]   for that device for security reasons, of course, and not for reasons to prevent you from, from
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:23.120]   getting your device fixed for one fourth or one third of the cost. And as always, I'm not sure
[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:28.240]   what the curve, what the most correct answer is. I, in principle, I think that you should be able
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:33.360]   to fix everything on your own or hire somebody you want to to fix it. I think you should be able to
[00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:38.400]   get any, any component you need to and replace it yourself or hire someone to replace for yourself.
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:43.360]   On the other hand, a phone, boy, you can't, you can't make these things out of Lego and still be
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:49.200]   able to put it in your pocket and take it out again. But if, if by any, by any measure, I'm glad
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:56.160]   that government agencies are, are at least willing to, to challenge Apple and say, hi, you're going
[00:49:56.160 --> 00:50:02.640]   to have to present documentary evidence to, to back up your assertion that the way that you build up
[00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:07.760]   the iPhone is best for everybody, including yourselves, including the consumers. Because we've had
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:13.760]   several years of all every manufacturer saying, Oh, no, no, no, yes. No, we, we, we won't, the thing
[00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:19.200]   is we're, we're, we're concerned about people buying counterfeit printer cartridges and then
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:24.640]   breaking their, their printers that are out of warranty. We're protecting the user by blocking
[00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:29.840]   them into our own super, super overpriced consumables. Like, okay, go ahead and say that, but now
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:35.520]   you're going to have to swear on oath, under penalty of perjury and actually demonstrate that
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:40.720]   you are actually telling the truth. So that's why I'm not against the these kind of investigations
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:45.360]   and these kind of queries. Yeah, I've mixed feelings. I mean, you're right. I don't want any government
[00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:50.960]   regulator to specify how a phone should be built. But I do think right to repair is a reasonable thing
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:56.480]   to demand to ask. So I don't know what the answer is. This story pushes all my buttons. And like,
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:51:01.680]   if I back off of it, I'm like, you know what, right to repair is good. Having, having governments
[00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:06.160]   say, you know, Apple, there is a line you can't cross in terms of what, what was said before,
[00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:11.520]   the idea that, yes, you want to protect the consumer from counterfeit parts. No, you don't want to
[00:51:11.520 --> 00:51:17.040]   erect a barrier that allows you to charge a ridiculous amount of money for the official parts
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:22.800]   so that people don't bother. And they just buy a new phone, right? Like, you want to find a way to
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:28.720]   say yes to the one and no to the other. And, and some regulation can do that. At the same time, I am
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:34.800]   reminded that France is the place where for several years, Apple had to sell the iPhone inside a
[00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:41.600]   larger box that contained a pair of ear pods, because there was a French law that said,
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:47.840]   all phones, I'm not going to do the French accent, must come with a hands-free kit because of,
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:54.160]   you know, woo, woo, scary cell phone radiation. When the world had moved on to all sorts of
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:52:00.160]   other kinds of headphones, in France, you got a phone in a box in a box. And that first box contained
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:05.520]   a phone in a box and a pair of headphones. That's the sort of thing where you look at the regulations
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:09.840]   and you're like, well, that's ridiculous, but they move so slowly and they're, you know, right? So,
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:15.200]   I get, I love what's at the core of this, which is in the end, you should be able to replace the
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:20.240]   battery on your phone. And Apple has been forced by others. Apple has been moving in that direction,
[00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:25.520]   and I think that's good. And we need more of that because the irony here is you talk about
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:33.440]   an early death and yet Apple's support for old hardware in their current OSes is second to none,
[00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:38.240]   right? Apple expects those phones to last. It's part of their business strategy. They want you to
[00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:44.240]   sell back your old phone so they can sell to somebody else, right? So it's a bit much to say
[00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:49.360]   planned obsolescence, but right to repair, yeah, I'm all for it. It's just super obnoxious when
[00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:55.760]   they're coding things like batteries and screens. It's like, okay, at that point, you really are just
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:59.360]   unnecessarily making things more difficult for a third party to repair people.
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:01.200]   Oh, we can all agree that you did.
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:07.280]   HP is requirement that you subscribe to the HP Incra Nules service in order to print with your
[00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:14.400]   printer is anti-competitive. But it feels like there's ways you prosecute that without saying,
[00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:20.320]   you know, I mean, there's, I think you're right, there's a line in the sand and you should make
[00:53:20.320 --> 00:53:26.720]   that a reasonable line. Yeah, I want to drink some delicious AG one, if you don't mind. Let's take a
[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:34.240]   little break for our sponsor. AG one like countless others. I want to support, you know, I don't eat
[00:53:34.240 --> 00:53:40.240]   right all the time. And you know, sometimes I feel like I need to supplement my normal regime
[00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:46.160]   just to make sure I'm getting the right vitamins and supplements and probiotics and prebiotics and
[00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:53.120]   all of that stuff. AG one is my solution founded in 2010, part of millions of routines since
[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:59.120]   it's one simple all in one solution for daily nutrition. Here's my AG one kit. I'm, I would
[00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:05.280]   recommend you get this, you get the special canister, you get the spoon, you get the AG one shaker,
[00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:12.320]   just add AG one to water doesn't even have to be warm water cool water shake it up. And you've got
[00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:17.600]   for less than three bucks a day, everything you need saves you time confusion and money,

[00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:37.280]   because I actually need this because I got up really early so that I can watch a very
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:45.040]   lesson. It's scintillating at Microsoft keynotes. June 5th will be a lot more fun.
[00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:49.680]   You're rehydrate rehydrate. You got to pace yourself. I know it's a long race. It's a marathon.
[00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:55.440]   Not a sprint. You know, Microsoft had one key note that was so long. They had a yoga trainer come
[00:55:55.440 --> 00:56:00.720]   out and help people stretch in the intermission. You didn't have to do that this time. I don't
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:04.880]   think. Yeah, that there should have been some notes during the work that we've done.
[00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:13.440]   Keep it short. Keep it short. All right. Moving moving right along with the program.
[00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:20.880]   Let's talk about June 5th. We're going to see. I think Glenn Fleischman notwithstanding.
[00:56:20.880 --> 00:56:28.080]   We're going to see VR helmet of some kind or as a ski goggles. That's the metaphor.
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:34.080]   I hope that's a helmet with a bit like spirally antenna sticking out from the top.
[00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:39.360]   Joanna Stern has coined the phrase, which I hope becomes standard of nerd helmet.
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:42.320]   I think that's what we should all call it from now on. Go ahead, Alex.
[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:48.000]   I think it should be. It should also filter the air and just be a whole like.
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:53.920]   It's like Dyson does. I think you do a whole daff punk look, you know, and just have it all
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:58.640]   there. I think that would be amazing. Let's do a voice changer in it too. So you can be like
[00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:06.080]   being right. You're better. I want to be on my Apple. I'm a roller wash.
[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:14.480]   Do you have one available for tonight? From nine of five has any meeting for me.
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:19.840]   From nine to five Mac, Apple has now trademarked at least five different names
[00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:27.120]   for whatever this new operating system will be. XROS reality, OS, real OS reality,
[00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:35.600]   ProOS and XROS have all been trademarked. But Mark Gurman says he's pretty sure it's going to be XROS.
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:45.200]   That's going to be the official name. Because it's very unextr
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:46.240]   more sense.
[00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:54.800]   But remember that this is the company that said, okay, so we're creating a brand new music player.
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:58:01.840]   It plays music, lots and lots of music. What are we going to call it? The iPod. That's what we're
[00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:06.560]   going to go with. The thing is, and the thing is, just like the iPad was not, hey, we're not going
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:10.480]   to call it the Apple. We sure are going to call it the iPad. I mobile slave. But we got used to it.
[00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:16.480]   Well, we got used to it. No, but yeah, I mean, Apple Watch is probably the most, the iPhone
[00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:19.680]   or the Apple Watch are probably the two most logical things they've come up with so far. But
[00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:25.280]   when you have a device like a virtual reality headset, that's going to be simply the launching
[00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:30.880]   off point for a whole line of what they hope to be smaller and more practical and reasonable
[00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:35.760]   augmented reality things. You could understand if they wanted to have something that was very,
[00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:41.040]   very malleable so that they could use it to attach the next five or six years were the products to it.
[00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:47.280]   Geezer nurses XROS kind of stumbles off the end of the tongue and then tumbles down the stairway
[00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:53.440]   breaks its neck. Jammer Bee says, if we're going to call it Nerd Helmet Jammer Bee says we should
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:59.440]   call it 10 Ross, which I hope does not become. Go ahead, Alex. I'm sorry.
[00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:03.440]   No, that's it. That's all. I think XR is too hard to say. Like I just think that though.
[00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:09.200]   XR also, you kind of expect the word windows to be in front of those two. Hey,
[00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:12.000]   I'm excited about Windows XR. Yeah.
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:16.240]   It's a version of Windows 10 specifically for risk based. Oh, no.
[00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:20.800]   Well, I'm already did the iPhone 10 R right. So they've already been they broke that one.
[00:59:20.800 --> 00:59:26.000]   I don't know. I mean, I like reality OS. I know that it's a mouthful and I know that it but it
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:31.440]   does what it says on the tin in a way that XR like maybe one day will all be like, oh, yes, XR,
[00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:37.280]   the XR revolution happened in 2023. Right. Right now it's sort of like the what now like VR people
[00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:42.080]   know and AR people know, but XR it's like too clever by half, but we'll get used to it if that's
[00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:42.960]   what it is. I think.
[00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:50.480]   Gurman has in his newsletter pointed out that pretty much every Apple executive has now peed on the
[00:59:50.480 --> 01:00:00.800]   XR headset. You know, that's sort of like rite of passage marking the responsibility for Apple's
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:07.920]   view. I mean, the list of names includes Johnny I've for crying out loud. He's not even there anymore.
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:15.760]   Mike Rockwell, who's been in charge of it since 2016. He helped craft the vision. According to
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:21.440]   Gurman for the headset and the technology development group itself, Apple COO, Jeff Williams, a driving
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:27.680]   force behind the headsets development for the last few years. Dan Riccio, Rockwell's boss,
[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:33.600]   the conduit between the technology development group and the top executives. He has worked
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:38.160]   exclusively on the headset over the last two years. I mean, that's a lot of manpower, a lot of top
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:43.840]   level executives to devote to a product that isn't even out yet. Paul Mead, who's Rockwell's most
[01:00:43.840 --> 01:00:50.400]   senior lieutenant handling hardware engineering for the device, Fletcher Rothkopf and Ray Chang,
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:59.200]   report to Mead. Johnny I've, although no longer at Apple, pushed the company to avoid designs that
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:04.560]   isolated you from the outside world. He lobbied for a more portable design, no external base station.
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:09.120]   He probably didn't like the idea. I think we've heard this is going to be the case that there is
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:15.600]   an external battery attached. Jaws, company's marketing chief, one of the biggest proponents of
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:24.160]   the headset on the executive team, Phil Schiller, Jaws's predecessor, Frank Casanova,
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:27.600]   head of marketing for the headset. We know Casanova has been there forever.
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:34.640]   Let's see. That makes sense. Apple doesn't do skunkworks projects.
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:41.440]   No, this is not, this is, they don't, everything they do, the top level of, the top level of
[01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:46.080]   Apple people are always in on everything. It feels like all hands on deck though.
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:50.240]   Let's put all the wood in these arrows or whatever it is they say.
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:58.640]   Jeff Norris, Johnny Schruggi, Shannon Gans, Jeff Stahl, it's just a who's who of Apple executives.
[01:01:58.640 --> 01:02:01.440]   John Hodgman. John Hodgman.
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:08.480]   It's all about, this thing's been going on for what, seven, eight years now.
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:13.680]   When I read stories about the executives here, I also had that thought of like,
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:17.840]   they say, "Oh, well, Johnny Schruggi was really grumpy about this and called it a science project."
[01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:23.840]   Okay. When? Was that 2015? Was that 2017? Was that last week? We don't know.
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:28.800]   And the story behind that too is that at one point they conceived of this thing having a
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:33.600]   little box, like the PSVR has a PlayStation and the whole box did all the work and then it just
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:41.760]   sent the images wirelessly to the headset, made the headset lighter. And apparently they built
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:47.280]   a processor for that and then they killed it. And they're like, "No, no, we're not going to do it.
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:51.440]   We're going to do it all on device." So like, if I were Johnny Schruggi and that happened,
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:57.680]   I would be grumpy about it, right? So it's very easy. Somebody in the Discord just
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:00.400]   said, "Does anybody in Apple like this thing? Why are they even coming out with it?"
[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:05.920]   And the answer is, I feel like what we're getting is the story of seven years of development of a
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:08.880]   thing that was going to be one thing, then it was going to be a different thing than they
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:11.520]   couldn't do that. So they made it a different thing. But here's the question, Jason. Have they
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:16.480]   now converged? Do they all agree now that this is the right thing at the right time? Tune in
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:22.240]   in two weeks to find out. I will see that if they're releasing it, I think they've probably
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:27.760]   converged on something only because Apple's not afraid of killing things. They'll put a lot of
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:31.840]   money. I've heard stories of them spending hundreds of millions. This is billions, but
[01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:36.640]   they're almost decades into a project type in the car. But I'm thinking, right.
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:44.720]   Yeah, I think that it does really feel like we're getting a gaslit.
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:50.720]   By all that. Like lowering expectations of everyone.
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:56.080]   So they're telling people, "Don't expect much. Yeah, this is just a developer unit.
[01:03:56.080 --> 01:04:01.440]   Don't expect." And then Alex, we will be blown away a week from Monday.
[01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:06.320]   If they release it, I think it's going to be pretty impressive. I don't know who we blown away,
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:12.080]   but I think if they release a product related to this, it's going to be probably the best headset
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:17.440]   that's been released so far. Is it going to make it be enough to turn it? But I don't think Apple
[01:04:17.440 --> 01:04:21.040]   is going to release something that said, "Well, it's almost as good as Oculus. I think that that's
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:26.480]   not going to be the case." So I think that as far as commercially available headsets, this is probably
[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:32.640]   going to be the top of the line. I think that there are certain numbers that they have to hit.
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:40.400]   I think that that's probably 90 frames a second 6K per eye. I think that that's a number that
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:45.200]   they probably have to get to because the other ones are a lot of them are floating in that range.
[01:04:47.840 --> 01:04:55.840]   And I think that really what makes it good enough for what the first release is probably
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:05:05.840]   90, 96 frames 6K per eye. The knock our socks off is 8 or 10K per eye at 120 frames a second.
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:08.640]   That's like everyone, they'll sell as many as they can make.
[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:16.480]   And I think that that's probably not the first version. But I think that if they came out at that
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:21.280]   level, it will be the thing that everybody wants to put on.
[01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:26.400]   It feels like their strategy here is very clearly release the best consumer or commercial
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:31.280]   widely available VR thing that could be made. And it's going to be too expensive and they're
[01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:35.200]   not going to sell that many of them. But clearly they've decided rather than make,
[01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:39.840]   because they could have shifted gears again and made the thing that we hear is coming in a year
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:44.640]   or two, which is the cheaper version. And they're going out with this. And I think the reason is,
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:49.600]   they want to not only claim some territory here, but they also want to set the bar and they want
[01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:57.840]   to say this is what a VR AR experience is. And if they are clearly better with these prices,
[01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:01.040]   I think we're going to that are rumored, I think that's what it's going to be.
[01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:06.160]   If they can clearly say we made the best one, anything less than this is not good enough
[01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:09.840]   until we come out with one at which point we'll change it, that's what their strategy is.
[01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:14.240]   Whether it'll work or not, I think is a real question, but I think that that's what they've
[01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:18.960]   decided to do is say we're going to define this category and try to beat us.
[01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:24.480]   I think that Apple's going to be going the exact opposite in the strategy that they did with the
[01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:30.160]   Apple Watch. I think that maybe even just in retrospect, but with Apple Watch, so long as they
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:35.920]   got the hardware right, so long as they designed a very beautiful elegant watch that did not look
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:40.560]   like a gadget watch was small enough that the first conversation you have with anybody
[01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:45.040]   went into a room is what the hell is that thing on your wrist, the software can come a little bit
[01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:50.720]   later. As long as it tells the time and has a stopwatch, they'll sell enough of them to get to the
[01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:56.000]   next iteration of the software. I think here they're in the opposite sort of boat, so long as they
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:07:00.320]   get the software right or at least show the potential of what they've got going on with,
[01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:04.960]   here is what we think the operating system is going to be for. Here's the sort of experiences and
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:11.280]   features and functions we want to enable through not only the stock apps, but through what developers
[01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:19.120]   can do with it. The first generation of buyers are going to be okay with essentially the Apple
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:25.120]   Lisa version of the headset. I don't think that they're going to be able to stake out the term.
[01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:31.360]   This is the absolutely the best headset that is possible to be made. It's like, well, it's still
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:38.320]   too heavy. It still has this clocky battery thing. It's still, but then someone will say, well,
[01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:42.400]   here's what other makers have been making for enterprise that actually don't have some of these
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:45.920]   problems because they've already been iterating for two or three or four years. That's not saying
[01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:50.160]   them up for failure, but that's just saying that I really think that Apple's story is going to be
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:56.880]   all about the software and all about the operating system. So that because we have no one's, even
[01:07:56.880 --> 01:08:04.480]   if $3,000 is setting us up to be really, really excited about a $2,000 price tag,
[01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:12.320]   a $2,000 price tag is still way too much for anybody, but a real motivated enthusiast or somebody
[01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:17.760]   who is going to write an app and make that money back from this app they're going to make for themselves
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:22.640]   for the feature that they're going to build for this thing. So they really are not in a position
[01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:27.120]   where they have to make something that wins the hearts and minds of everybody. It's not going to
[01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:32.720]   be a practical thing for in any way, shape or form. And once that is sort of the pressure is off,
[01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:38.480]   it comes down to how fun is it? How did you design the theater app so that when I'm watching,
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:44.480]   I'm watching iTunes content, when I'm watching Apple TV content, how fun is it to watch Apple TV
[01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:51.840]   content with it? If you decide if you, the game developers that you've been, that have been,
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:57.520]   sorry, the game developers who have had access to these APIs already probably now for a couple
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:02.640]   of months, when they show up that first game, how cool is that game? And when someone comes up with
[01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:07.280]   something that's actually functional and practical, is that going to say this is not going to change
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:13.360]   my life? This, this productivity thing is not going to justify the two to $3,000, but I can see how
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:17.680]   yeah, the next iteration of this hardware, this a little bit less expensive, a little bit lighter,
[01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:23.760]   a little bit more practical, is definitely going to be something that wants me to put $1,500 under
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:29.120]   my mattress for 2024. Yeah, and I think that they can get away with a lot when they, by calling it
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:33.680]   the developer edition. So if you're going to release it at WWDC, call it the developer edition,
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:39.840]   this is just for developers. And so people might even have to pay $100 to extra to buy it,
[01:09:39.840 --> 01:09:43.040]   you know, like you have to be a developer. I mean, they may just limit it to developers,
[01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:47.120]   which is millions of people. And the most likely wants to pay that kind of money anyway.
[01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:53.600]   But I think that I think I think it's hard to make these. And I think that even at $3,000 or
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:58.160]   $2,000, whatever that number is, they'll sell as many as they can make. You know, like it, you
[01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:04.160]   know, I don't think that I think that it's they don't have the capacity to probably put out a
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:08.640]   huge volume of them as it is just because they're very complicated and they're right on the outer
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:14.400]   edge of what's possible. I do think you're going to probably see a pretty big lineup of partners.
[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:17.760]   So I'm going to guess there's going to be lots of slides with lots of logos on it.
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:23.120]   And they're going to say, we have hundreds of people that have already been working on this.
[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:26.480]   And we've got blah, blah, blah, you know, like that's going to be, you know, like they're going to,
[01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:31.360]   if it's Apple, they're going to show this big, you know, group of people that are that have
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:35.520]   already built building things. I think that we're going to see some things that have been running
[01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:41.600]   for a while that just happened to work on it. Like the Amazon, I don't know if you buy something
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:46.480]   on a phone on your iPhone, it'll it'll ask you, Hey, do you want to see this in your house? You
[01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:50.720]   know, like for a lot of things. And I think that they're going to show they're going to show that
[01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:54.640]   stuff, you know, of being able to throw that on and be able to walk around a house with,
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:11:00.560]   you know, the stuff from a, I wouldn't be really surprised if we don't see a Kia Home Depot,
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:06.960]   Amazon, you know, like those ones showing, you know, you could walk around your house with all the
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:11.520]   new furniture that you just bought and just feel like you're there. And we're going to take the
[01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:15.200]   lighting from the location and we're going to light all the stuff and put it all together. And
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:18.800]   there's a bunch of things that it can do that are pretty that could be that it could do that
[01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:22.000]   would be pretty interesting. So, so I think that those are the kind of things that you're going to
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.160]   see and then you're going to see a lot of games, you're going to see a lot of, you know, some, I
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:31.360]   still think we're going to probably see, you know, the office apps, you know, get activated. And I'd
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:38.640]   be really interested to see if we get, if we see MLS, you know, like you, when there's a score,
[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:42.400]   you can go back, if you throw on your headset right now, this is the big advantage we've talked about
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:47.600]   before, is the integration of it with all the other hardware devices that you may have in your house.
[01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:52.400]   So, it knows where you are in the Apple TV. It knows where you are on your phone and you can put the
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:56.080]   headset on and it will immediately jump into the state that it needs to be in to show you something
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:12:00.480]   that was related to what you were just looking at is really, really important because it's the one
[01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:05.680]   of the hardest things to do on the Oculus headset. You've stimulated a question that I want to ask
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:13.280]   all of you. You know, when the iPod came out, it wasn't, it was evolutionary. It wasn't a
[01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:20.960]   amazing technological advancement on existing MP3 players. It was evolutionary. And the content
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:26.240]   was, you know, not new, it was just playing the stuff that you already used to. When the iPhone
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:31.760]   came out, it was technically revolutionary. It was the first time we'd seen a pinch and zoom interface.
[01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:38.240]   There was a lot of technical innovation and, you know, the software was because of it revolutionary.
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:45.120]   So, I'd be very curious, Alex, two questions, I guess. Is this going to be an evolutionary product
[01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:51.360]   or a revolutionary product? Will there be technologies on here that you go, wow, like this phoviated
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:57.040]   vision you were talking about in the Discord, Jason. And then the kind of follow on,
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:13:00.480]   will the content be evolutionary or revolutionary? What do you think, Alex?
[01:13:00.480 --> 01:13:04.080]   I think it's all going to be evolutionary. And I think the iPhone was evolutionary. I think the
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:09.920]   iPhone did what all other apps had, Matt. I mean, I had a trio that I could check email,
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:15.360]   I could go on the web, I could do the, you know, I could, I had GPS, I had almost everything the
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:20.720]   iPad, iPad did. It's just what the iPhone did. The big difference was the iPhone gave me a new
[01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:23.360]   interface for it. You know, it gave me a much sleeker interface.
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:28.960]   Well, that's a technical rev. I mean, the, the, the, the slab of glass, nobody done that before.
[01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:33.600]   No one had done that before, but I still, I would still say that the functionality of that phone,
[01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:37.200]   other than that piece of glass, that was, but I would still argue that that wasn't
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:42.320]   a huge jump forward. It was just something that, you know, seemed obvious once you saw it.
[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:48.640]   And then the, the, and then, but with the, and I agree that the older ones were, were evolutionary.
[01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:51.120]   I think the iPad, there's already tablets out there.
[01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:54.800]   iPad was just a big iPhone. iPad was definitely evolutionary.
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:58.560]   Yeah. I think that the, I think that the evolutionary piece of this is that, you know,
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:02.480]   Oculus is out there. You know, there's been other things that have been out there that have shown
[01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:06.640]   us a lot of what's possible. But I think that, you know, what Apple's doing.
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:08.000]   So this will just be a polished Oculus.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:12.720]   Well, I think that it'll be more than that. I think that, I think that it'll have, I mean,
[01:14:12.720 --> 01:14:15.840]   I think that it's going to have a much higher, I mean, I think it's going to significantly
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:22.400]   high resolution significantly. So it's a high resolution with higher frame rate, which makes
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:28.640]   a huge difference. Like it's just, it's hard to describe like what it, what it means when you can
[01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:32.320]   see a higher resolution at a higher frame rate. It really feels like you're there, you know,
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:36.160]   and it's hard for people to imagine until you see it, but it's, it's, it makes a massive difference.
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:41.600]   And so, but the other thing that, that I think is, I wouldn't say revolutionary, but
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:48.480]   I do think that Apple is building a pipeline for generating new content that is much more robust
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:53.680]   than what Oculus has ever had. You know, and I think that that is a huge limiter to Oculus.
[01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:57.840]   Oculus is hard to develop for, you know, and it becomes one of those things that's really
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:03.360]   cumbersome to build tools. Apple has been slowly building the tools in the pipeline for this
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:08.480]   for five years, you know, that when we watch USDZ come out, when we watch creator, you know, reality,
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:13.600]   you know, the reality converter and the reality, like all these reality tools and being able to
[01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:17.600]   play with it on the phone and do all the things that they're doing, all of those things become,
[01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:23.120]   those are all services that are designed for this headset. Like they're not for the phone.
[01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:27.040]   You know, the phone was a place for them to play on it. And so they're, they're building this,
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:32.480]   this big apparatus because that has been a huge issue. Like when you want to use an Oculus,
[01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:37.440]   you can't, you know, oh, I have this and now there's something on my keynote that they want to show
[01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:41.680]   me. And if I click on it, I can put this headset on a walk around it and look at it or rotate it
[01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:46.400]   and everything else. That means anybody can create something for, for the headset, you know, anybody
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:50.800]   could create potentially something in, in keynote that they can sit there and just click on these
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:55.200]   things and they're all popping up and it's an adventure that a teacher can create or, or an
[01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:59.840]   individual can create for other people or a salesperson. That's the kind of stuff that I think Apple's
[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:03.920]   going to do that Facebook just doesn't have the tools to do. They don't have the, and so I think
[01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:08.480]   that that's going to be something that's really interesting. And I think Apple is very committed
[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:13.200]   to it. And I think that we're going to see a lot of, a lot of different kinds of content. I think
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:19.440]   that I think Apple is going to fund a lot of things that go into this. This is a, this is an
[01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:26.080]   all or nothing thing. If they actually announce it, you know, in two weeks, I think you're going to
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:31.120]   see or a little less than two weeks, you're going to see an enormous amount of, of investment into
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:36.000]   this, into this channel because they can't afford to lose, like they can't, I mean, they can't afford
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:41.520]   to have this not, not work. So. And Andy, what do you think evolutionary revolutionary?
[01:16:41.520 --> 01:16:46.880]   I, I think that their roadmap is revolutionary. I think that what they're going to show off in
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:51.920]   two weeks is evolutionary. I think that they have, I started to use a buzzword, but it's just
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:58.080]   perfectly descriptive. They have the longest runway of any company that wants to get into VR and AR.
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:04.880]   They can basically have a, they can have a five year plan that is predicated on them, making no
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:10.880]   real progress for the first couple of years, except for getting everybody primed for version
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:18.240]   three of this headset. So if all they do with this first demo is again, show off a really cool
[01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:23.600]   in terms of packed in apps, the things you get for free with the, with the device,
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:27.840]   all of your Apple TV stuff, all your iTunes stuff, we've made this really cool theater sort of
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:31.760]   thing. And also this really cool environment where you can actually be watching them,
[01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:36.000]   watching the movie or watching the TV show with your friends. And it's like there, and your,
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:40.000]   and if your friend is quote sitting on quote to your left, you hear them, they're, they're making
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:45.440]   wise comments from, from, from the, from the correct side of your, of your face. I think that's,
[01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:51.600]   that's going to be enough. Because again, they have enough time to figure out who's going to be,
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:55.440]   how, what kind of, what kind of people are buying this are going to be buying this stuff.
[01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:58.880]   What are they going to be using it for? We know we got games, we know we've got,
[01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:08.480]   we know, we know we have training and, and, and basically collaborative shared experiences.
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:12.960]   Do we have something that, that is an iPhone is sort of a device? Do we have something that's
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:18.080]   even an iPad sort of device where someone changes the way that they work because they have one of
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:23.040]   these things or the ideal is going to be that someone isn't just, Hey, I've got, I'm the sort of
[01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:30.000]   person who can blow $3,000 today and maybe $1,200, five years from now on this gadget that looks like
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:36.560]   a lot of fun. In, at the end of the day, we buy an iPhone because we can see ourselves doing things
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:40.240]   that we couldn't do before. We see this going to save, it's going to solve problems for us
[01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:47.440]   and create opportunities. And that's why we spend $1,000 on a phone. So they have five years to
[01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:52.400]   figure out how to make that argument to us. I don't think they're going to be able to make it in the
[01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:56.160]   first year, but I do think that they have a five year plan that says that here is something that
[01:18:56.160 --> 01:19:00.960]   you haven't thought of. There's the implications of having a collaborative environment in which it
[01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:04.400]   doesn't matter that everybody has the things that strapped to their face because no one's actually
[01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:09.440]   looking directly at anybody's face to begin with in this, in this conversation. So evolutionary,
[01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:14.560]   then revolutionary, I am actually going to come. I'm betting on black and white.
[01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:20.560]   Jason, what do you think? Well, this just be an evolution of existing hardware,
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:26.080]   or is it going to have some technologies in it that change things that are superior?
[01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:32.880]   Like Andy, I'm going to cheat. I think hardware-wise, it's going to be evolutionary, right? I think
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:37.440]   none of this. There have been some great videos and articles that have broken down the rumors
[01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:42.000]   about the hardware. We actually got a bill of lading analysis this week, right, about what the
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:45.840]   parts are. I think everybody knows what the panels are and what are they.
[01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:50.400]   Last I saw there were conflicting reports. The information thought two 8k displays,
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:56.320]   the others said two 4k displays. Yeah, I mean, there's a little lack of clarity,
[01:19:56.320 --> 01:20:02.000]   but it's going to be like $1,600 to $1,600 just in parts, right? So it's going to be very expensive,
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:06.080]   but we know it's going to be pretty good. And none of that, like Apple is not rumored to have
[01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:12.080]   invented a new X for this, right? So it's going to be- Johnny, I've wanted it to have your eyeballs
[01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:16.240]   screen. Yeah, Mark Herman still thinks that that's going to happen.
[01:20:16.240 --> 01:20:19.600]   The third screen that's your face cannot imagine that.
[01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:23.920]   I would say that's revolutionary. As stupid as it is.
[01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:28.800]   As dumb as it is, it's still something nobody ever did or thought of.
[01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:34.480]   It's true. I mean, they could surprise us. We've been talking about this for so long,
[01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:38.240]   and yet they could possibly surprise us, but they're assembling these things in a factory.
[01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:42.320]   So probably not. But what I would say is, while the hardware is going to be like a spare
[01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:50.080]   no expense evolution, it's like really nice VR hardware. The revolutionary part,
[01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:56.000]   if it's possible, it'll be in the software and it may not be there or it may be there or we may get
[01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:01.120]   a glimmer of it. But I do agree with Andy that that is where you get some of that secret Apple
[01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:07.600]   sauce is what if Apple releases the thing and we all look at it and go, "Oh yeah, you know,
[01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:14.880]   I've used a PSVR, I've used a Quest." It's like that. Well, okay, that's not revolutionary,
[01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:20.320]   but I do think that they're behind the scenes for seven years working on this thing. I sure hope
[01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:26.960]   there are stuff, there are things in that demo that we look at that we go, "Oh wow, what an
[01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:32.480]   interesting idea, right?" Like that they have done some stuff that we haven't really seen other
[01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:37.120]   folks. That would be a winner. That would be a winner. Nobody's doing that, right?
[01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:41.760]   I think there's another headset out there that this Fovietta rendering. I don't think they're
[01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:50.240]   unique. Maybe a high end. I think the PyMax, P-I-M-I-X has a, but whoever heard of them.
[01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:57.840]   So I think the hardware is going to be really, really good, but not beyond what we expect
[01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:05.520]   the best to be. I do think the wildcard is software because I don't think that that is a field that
[01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:10.960]   has been completely tilled, right? Like different people are trying different things. And if there's
[01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:19.120]   a through line through a lot of Apple's successes, it's not that it was revolutionary, but they had
[01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:25.920]   a way to apply the existing tech and their software to make something that redefined what that
[01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:29.760]   product category was. And if they can get away with something like that in June,
[01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:34.800]   that or start getting away with it, beginning in June, I think that would be the thing to look
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:40.960]   for is just how different is that or what do they always say, blow away? It's blow away, they say,
[01:22:40.960 --> 01:22:46.240]   losing all sense of grammar. That's what I'm intrigued by because I love the idea that they're
[01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:51.040]   going to come out with some stuff for VR that everybody who's used VR up to now looks at and goes,
[01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:55.440]   "Oh, that's so much better than what I've seen before. I hope to see that."
[01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:59.760]   Well, and I think that the content is going to be important, like what content is available,
[01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:04.080]   what content is coming out. And I think that that's going to be as important as the software is to
[01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:08.320]   plenty of content that a bunch of us have worked on that never saw the light of day,
[01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:11.600]   that we were like, "This would sell a lot of headsets," but it was really hard to make.
[01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:18.000]   We have to remember that Apple bought Next VR, so there could be things where you have stereo
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:23.280]   VR of, again, in locations at a much higher resolution. And again, the frame rate and
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:27.600]   resolution are going to be a big deal. If they turn that corner, there's a lot of things that
[01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:34.240]   become very possible and very interesting that just haven't been there yet in anything that we've
[01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:38.640]   seen so far. And that takes a lot of processing. I think one of the big advantages that Apple has
[01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:43.840]   here is to get back to the software and the hardware is they're making the chips. They're making
[01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:48.960]   the chips and they're writing the software. And they can integrate it with an iOS solutions,
[01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:55.360]   TVOS solutions, Mac OS solutions, and being able to have all of those things integrated into one
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:24:01.840]   unified experience where you put that on as part of a bigger experience that's there is, I think it's
[01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:06.880]   Apple may fumble it. I mean, there was the trashcan Mac Pro.
[01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:14.160]   And when we knew they're like, it's not that they can't do that, but they've been working on it
[01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:19.200]   for so long and they built such a ramp for it. And I think that it'll be really interesting.
[01:24:19.200 --> 01:24:21.120]   I'm obviously very interested to see what happens.
[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:27.440]   Yeah. And one of the biggest assets they have that no other competitor can even approach is that
[01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:33.280]   they've developed a lot of good credit with their developing community. We talk a lot about how
[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:38.880]   sometimes Apple underserved their developers. But one thing they always come through with is that
[01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:45.520]   if they tell you that, hey, we are investing in this direction for here is how we're going to do
[01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:52.960]   cloud sharing. Here's how we're going to do multiple displays. Here's how we're going to do
[01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:59.440]   X, Y, and Z. Here's our plan for whatever. If you are excited as a developer about what you could
[01:24:59.440 --> 01:25:04.080]   do with these new APIs, you know that Apple is not going to pull the rug up from under you after two
[01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:09.920]   or three years. They're not going to switch messaging platforms on you because somebody lost a bet
[01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:15.840]   and someone lost a ran out of time on their career meter. And now they're the messaging app
[01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:21.120]   that they've been they've been champion at the company is dead. And someone else's messaging
[01:25:21.120 --> 01:25:27.760]   app is coming in instead. So if you feel so and because Apple also has some of the most creative
[01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:34.080]   and passionate and artistic developers out there, they're exactly the sort of people to, you know
[01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:38.080]   what, I got $3,000. I'm going to buy one of these things because I'm just curious to see what I could
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:43.600]   build with this. And then after two or three years, they become like the Omni Group, this company that
[01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:50.400]   did that company that does for Apple VR, what the Omni Group did for next and then Apple,
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:54.800]   saying we are not just writing incredibly good and innovative apps. We're writing it incredibly
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:59.120]   good and innovative apps that uniquely take advantage of what this hardware and what this
[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:04.000]   operating system or what these APIs can do. So they're in a really, really good position. I just
[01:26:04.000 --> 01:26:10.320]   don't think it's going to be for another couple of years yet. One of the things just to be quick
[01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:16.320]   about it is that with hardware devices like this, the first thing you have to see is who is
[01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:20.880]   manufacturing the sort of display technology that they're going to need to really pull this off.
[01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:26.720]   You're not seeing it. Who's going to have the sort of camera technology that can make them pull off
[01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:30.880]   what we're hoping that they'll pull off? Nobody's been, no one's been showing that stuff off yet.
[01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:35.440]   So we're still going to be limited to relatively low frame rate, high resolution, but not as high
[01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:41.840]   as what we would like, very limited field of view. So there's not a whole lot you can do when
[01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:47.680]   you can't give people a peripheral vision. So they're going to be stuck with what they can serve
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:52.400]   given the components and given the technology they have available right now. But like I said before,
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:58.080]   so long as they say that we've got our software story on lock, we've basically prepared this
[01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:01.600]   runway. We're not going to get there. We're not going to take off for three or four or five years,
[01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:06.160]   but oh boy, if you've got three grand, you're going to have fun. You're going to have fun on the
[01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:10.080]   roof steering this plane left and right on the ground. And I think that they may not have a
[01:27:10.080 --> 01:27:15.200]   consumer device that's even aimed at the consumer and that even has a production for at least a year
[01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:20.080]   if not two. So the thing is, is that this is going to be the way you get this is your developer and
[01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:25.600]   you buy the developer edition. You know, maybe the only way you buy this for a year or two and
[01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:31.120]   they'll still some nights of those of those developer editions. I don't think that the I don't think
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:36.720]   that Google Glass is the champion that anybody wants to emulate. But some of the smart things they
[01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:41.440]   did do was this is we're calling this the Explorer edition just like you alluded to before it's called
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:46.880]   the developer edition. And we are not basically we're not putting these on pegs at Best Buy.
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:51.920]   If you send us an email and say and make a case for what you would do with this and why you would
[01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:58.320]   be useful for us as we're trying to figure out if this is a thing or not. In bit in dribs and drabs,
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:04.560]   we will allow you to pay $1,500 for this for this thing. That means that the first people they got
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:10.400]   were people who were either a journalists on expense accounts who really wanted to just rip on that
[01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:13.840]   and get lots of copy out of it, which is fair. This is what we do for a living.
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:19.840]   But also people who are invested emotionally and boy, I've always thought this is a technology
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:25.440]   that could happen. And I'm willing to spend a lot of money for a half bake product because this half
[01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:29.600]   bake product is the best that we have half bake though it is. So this is this is why it's going
[01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:37.440]   to be exciting for the next few years. Yeah, I think that the one the one challenges with Google
[01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:42.560]   Glass was that the folks that got into it first were really into it and weren't thinking about all
[01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:47.840]   the impacts that they have people around them. So it really hit the camera, which was the coolest
[01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:52.400]   part of the Google Glass. The fact that you could see the viewfinder right in front of you and have
[01:28:52.400 --> 01:29:00.640]   a camera was amazing. And it's still the best version of that that I've seen so far. But of course,
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:06.320]   people started using them everywhere and it made everybody uncomfortable. And that was that I
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:10.560]   really believe that was the downfall was that camera. But you couldn't take it away because it
[01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:15.440]   was the coolest part of the whole I mean, it's what I use it's one for the for glass primarily what I
[01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:20.000]   used it for was to shoot videos of things right in front of me where I could point to things or
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:25.520]   with my kids or with other things that you know, I you could create things that you just never were
[01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:29.440]   able to create before. And it's not the same as these little Facebook Ray bands because I can't
[01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:34.480]   see what I'm shooting. Like I can I can shoot towards it. But what was great about the glass is that I
[01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:42.480]   could see what I was shooting. And anyway, it's all it is. I won't turn this into a this is starting to
[01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:46.000]   be one of those great conversations we have when you're staying over at my house and suddenly
[01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:51.360]   realize that hey, if you have to leave for your plane in eight hours, that was too late. Let's just
[01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:57.920]   let's just stay up all night. But yeah, I keep I keep thinking that all Google needed to do was
[01:29:57.920 --> 01:30:04.960]   add like a 22 cent piece of plastic, just a permanent cover for that camera that take it. That's orange
[01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:08.240]   that says that Oh, well, I'm sure you've heard that does have a camera built into it. But as you can
[01:30:08.240 --> 01:30:12.560]   see, there's this big block of orange plastic in front of it that's covering the lens. You don't
[01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:16.080]   see anything looks like a lens here do you? And of course, I of course, when I'm taking pictures,
[01:30:16.080 --> 01:30:20.480]   I'm playing with my kids. I want to take pictures of video of me playing with my kids without I flip
[01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:24.240]   it up. And that's what you can see it. But Oh, no, of course, of course, the last thing Google wants
[01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:29.760]   to do is make you worry that when you're talking to me that you're being Oh, dear, 22 cents. I go
[01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:36.400]   3D printer, 22 cents, 18 minutes. Beautiful. Let's not forget that Google Glass is more than 10 years
[01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:43.120]   ago. Yeah, right. It was so great. It was a great piece of hardware. It was it was great. I loved it.
[01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:47.840]   The Google Apple had the Newton message pad before they had the iPhone and the iPad. This I think
[01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:53.920]   that this is there could be an analogy here where Google Glass had a lot of great ideas. It was
[01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:59.520]   before its time and maybe there's going to be maybe part of the problem is going to be we the
[01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:04.880]   generation that's really going to slam dunk this is the generation that grew up with smartphones,
[01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:09.120]   grew up with the expectation that yes, there are always there are always cameras on me. Yes,
[01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:12.640]   I'm always sharing my life with total strangers. And those are going to be the people who are
[01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:18.480]   going to be less worried about themselves going out in public with a device that everyone knows
[01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:22.880]   is partially a camera and they themselves are going to be less concerned in certain social groups
[01:31:22.880 --> 01:31:26.480]   with going out with people who are also wearing cameras on their faces. Who knows? This is a
[01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:30.960]   social experiment. So I love about technology. It is a social experiment, not just a commercial
[01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:36.240]   and a technical one. It is a it is ways that we learn about ourselves and who we are as a species.
[01:31:36.240 --> 01:31:41.760]   I'm not just it's time and time again. We ask questions that we would never have asked before
[01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:47.280]   because we never had a need to ask before. Also, I think Apple might be starting to say, gosh,
[01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:52.320]   we should have, I know, met is saying this. We didn't know that AR was going to be AI was going to
[01:31:52.320 --> 01:32:00.800]   become the next big thing. And we shoot. We miss that one. I find it really hard not to be skeptical
[01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:06.320]   and just think this is a terrible idea and it's not going to go anywhere. The one thing, the one
[01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:14.160]   technological advance that would make make me second guess myself is if it's really small and
[01:32:14.160 --> 01:32:18.480]   uncomfortable, I don't think it's going to be. I think we're pretty sure it's going to be big
[01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:24.480]   and happy. But that would be the one thing. I just am very skeptical. Having bought every
[01:32:24.480 --> 01:32:34.400]   VR helmet, every nerd helmet available, I've seen zero progress. It's just there's no reason to think
[01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:41.760]   that anybody wants this. Anybody would buy it for any price. I don't care what that story is.
[01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:46.000]   I think that's going to be the interesting thing is it's I think it's entirely, I'm more optimistic
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:50.880]   than you are Leo, but I think it's entirely possible that you watch that demo and say,
[01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:57.280]   see, I told you, there's nothing else here. I think it's possible. And I'm curious to see
[01:32:57.280 --> 01:33:02.560]   whether they really advance the ball or not because that's going to be, I think, a huge question here
[01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:07.120]   because if it's more the same and you've just looked at it and say, oh, okay, it's just more of the
[01:33:07.120 --> 01:33:14.080]   same, I think you're on much more solid ground. Well, and there's a risk that I was just watching
[01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:17.920]   the Microsoft Build Conference, of course, their developer conference, but there's a risk that a
[01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:23.040]   lot of the developers who might consider VR content are saying, yeah, I'm going to work on that
[01:33:23.040 --> 01:33:30.160]   AR thing. That's where it's really happening. I don't know. Any what developer would say, oh,
[01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:34.240]   yeah, VR, now it's going to happen. They're going to have to really do some pitching.
[01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:41.200]   Yeah, but if you've spent the last 10 years of your life working in VR, you're not going to
[01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:44.960]   suddenly pivot to artificial intelligence. I mean, you've got the skills you need to build.
[01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:50.720]   And also Apple's got the checkbook open. If you've been working in AI, that's where you're going
[01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:55.600]   as well. You're a graphics person, I guess. I mean, we have a friend Gary who's been
[01:33:55.600 --> 01:34:02.080]   VRing for more than a decade, I think two decades. Certainly that's the first time I saw a VR helmet
[01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:09.840]   was at the SIGGRAPH in 1992. And he's excited about every one of these that comes out. And they never,
[01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:16.320]   he returned to Zoculus Pro. Because it just, I mean, I just can't break through.
[01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:21.680]   But there's a lot of, I mean, I don't know, I feel like there's a lot of technologies that we
[01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:29.520]   talk about that takes some time to get from one side to the other. And I think that it is,
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:33.600]   and a lot of it has to do with just the money that's required. But I think that I wonder if Apple
[01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:40.080]   will also take some guide from Epic. One of the biggest successes to moving things forward
[01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:45.360]   in for Epic has been the mega grants. Those have been like, it's not an investment, it's just money.
[01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:50.160]   And if you're developing something new that's interesting, we're going to give you some money
[01:34:50.160 --> 01:34:55.600]   to do it. And it can be in the thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of dollars. And I think
[01:34:55.600 --> 01:35:00.080]   that Apple should hopefully look at that really closely and go, well, we're going to give a
[01:35:00.080 --> 01:35:02.640]   bunch of developers, like if they announced that they're going to give a bunch of developers
[01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:08.000]   grants, you know, to go out and experiment with it, I think that that gets a lot of developers
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:12.800]   interested pretty quickly. Yeah. But that is, it is a good thing to be concerned about, because
[01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:18.720]   Generative AI is something that is kind of right up Apple Street in terms of what they
[01:35:18.720 --> 01:35:23.360]   feel themselves to be a company, the sort of products that they like to do as a company.
[01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:28.800]   When you talk about, when you talk about Armageddon, we'll put that to a side. We'll focus on the idea
[01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:35.120]   of, you know, here's how easy it is to write software. It's like, we will that if you can just
[01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:41.200]   simply describe it, our generative AI will switch, we have a new version of our developer kit that
[01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:45.280]   can, that can co-pilot, whatever it is you're trying to write. This is not for professionals,
[01:35:45.280 --> 01:35:48.720]   because professionals are going to want to fine tune things better. But this will walk you through
[01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:55.520]   the development of Mac and iOS software. Or if you got, if you need some help on, if you took a bad
[01:35:55.520 --> 01:36:01.920]   picture, we've got onboard secure privacy or privacy oriented software that will do stuff like
[01:36:01.920 --> 01:36:07.920]   what we're seeing in the new Photoshop beta that's basically basically saying, yeah, basically,
[01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:14.640]   my daughter brought a guy that he'd been dating, she's been dating for two weeks to a big family
[01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:20.560]   wedding. And now he's in all the wedding pictures, and now we need him gone. And basically,
[01:36:20.560 --> 01:36:25.360]   not just simply magic eraser, but it looks like nothing was there to begin with. All of this sort
[01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:31.520]   of stuff is empowering people, allowing them to do things they couldn't do before to explore
[01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:36.480]   parts of their creativity that they didn't have the technical skills or the technical training to
[01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:41.200]   be able to explore before. So if so, if Apple products are not the sort of thing that lets you do that,
[01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:46.880]   and for that you have to buy something else and use it with an Apple product, that kind of makes
[01:36:46.880 --> 01:36:52.160]   Apple stuff lesser than particularly compared to what Windows will offer, particularly compared to
[01:36:52.160 --> 01:36:56.320]   what Android is going to offer. I think that what will be interesting again is, I don't know if you
[01:36:56.320 --> 01:36:59.920]   need generative AI as much as you just need to have a really large library of things. So like,
[01:36:59.920 --> 01:37:04.880]   for instance, if someone puts a headset on and goes, give me a chair over here, and I need this
[01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:08.960]   over here, and I need that over there, it doesn't need to build those from generative AI. It could
[01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:14.640]   have huge libraries of stuff, and maybe those are from a Kia, from Home Depot, and I can walk in and
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:20.080]   say, I want this here, this here, this here, and start talking to it. I mean, oh, no one, because
[01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:23.760]   no one, it doesn't happen. But what if you could, how often would you do it? You wouldn't do it every
[01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:29.600]   day, you wouldn't do it every week or months, you might do once in a while. It's not a big market.
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:35.040]   One other thing that's psychologically, and this is really far out there though,
[01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:39.760]   but I noticed that people are watching less TV, they're listening to less podcast,
[01:37:39.760 --> 01:37:46.800]   fewer podcasts. Pandemic is over, and we want to go outside. And it seems to me, this might be the
[01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:53.200]   wrong time to put out a product that fixes you in front of a screen and isolates you from the
[01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:59.200]   outside. It may psychologically be just the absolute wrong time to release this product. I'm just
[01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:04.960]   throwing it out there. I may be, but the problem is that if you look at the success or lack
[01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:10.800]   thereof for events, that's not been the case. No, people don't want to go to an event either.
[01:38:10.800 --> 01:38:16.240]   They want to go for an office. They don't want to go to offices. They don't want to go to events.
[01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:20.800]   They don't want to, so, but I'm just saying that I don't, maybe that's the case, but there's also a
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:26.000]   lot of people that are, and I think that I do think that when you're seeing drops in a lot of
[01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:34.000]   these things, I am looking at my own behavior. There's other things that are coming up.
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:40.160]   So a lot of magazines having lots of audio has filled a lot of my time that used to be podcasts.
[01:38:40.160 --> 01:38:50.240]   I listened to whatever news over audio or whatever all the time, because it's just popcorn of audio
[01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:56.880]   that didn't exist a year ago or two years ago. At least I didn't know about it. And I find myself,
[01:38:56.880 --> 01:39:03.040]   I almost never watch broadcast TV anymore. I watch a little bit of A show that I'm interested in
[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:09.440]   Netflix or A show on Apple TV. And then almost a solid 60, 70% of my viewing is in YouTube.
[01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:12.320]   You know, and so I don't think you're the two.
[01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:14.960]   I don't know. I talk to a lot of people that talk about how much they're watching,
[01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:19.520]   because it's about things that you're interested in. It's not that people are watching goofy things
[01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:25.440]   on YouTube. It is, I need to know how to do this thing. My son built a PC by watching a video on
[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:30.000]   YouTube. My daughter plays three instruments, which he's only learned by watching YouTube.
[01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:35.280]   Literally, she's no less than I just don't take. We're normal people.
[01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:42.160]   I don't. I mean, it just seems like in their world, I will say it is like the culture of
[01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:45.360]   you go to YouTube to learn how to do things. Like, it's just, you know, like, that's how they
[01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:50.720]   absorb it in a way that looks really painful to me, like learning how to play a piece of music
[01:39:50.720 --> 01:39:54.880]   by stopping and rewinding, stopping rewinding, stopping rewinding, stopping rewinding.
[01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:59.200]   To me, it's like a little version of hell, but she figures out how to do it. And she learns
[01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:01.920]   whole songs like once a week. Right. You know, so right.
[01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:06.400]   Well, we'll see. I'm just giving Apple an excuse for when it's a huge flop, which is going to be.
[01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:13.920]   I don't know. I wish I didn't. But, and I wish, and I hope I'm wrong, actually, because I think,
[01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:18.640]   you know, that sci-fi premise of a metaverse is very exciting.
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:23.280]   I know so much of it has to do with hardware. I mean, I walked in, I, you know, 1998, I walked
[01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:28.800]   into a pretty, like a gray room that was probably 20 feet by 20 feet. There was a big
[01:40:28.800 --> 01:40:33.760]   umbilical cord and I put a headset on and I said, give me a cube this big and I put my hand out
[01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:38.560]   and it appeared. And I was able to pull it and turn it and everything else. I only had a couple
[01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:42.640]   minutes in there. And I was like, Oh my gosh, by 2005, I'm not going to have to use an
[01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:46.800]   out to model. I'm going to be able to do all this stuff and everything else. And when you dig into
[01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:53.200]   it, it's just the hardware is so hard to do that well. And again, it comes down to, you know,
[01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:58.960]   frame rate and in resolution are just very unforgiving things. And people don't want to have
[01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:03.120]   something on their head that is low resolution or low frame rate, you know, like that bothers them.
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:08.160]   And they don't know it, but it just becomes tiresome for them. And as that frame rate and
[01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:12.400]   resolution go up, it feels more and more natural for them to be in those areas. And so I think
[01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:18.800]   that that's why I think that the all the work that I've done, I mean, I've done a lot of AR and
[01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:25.440]   VR work for companies. And it really came down when that resolution and frame rate started going
[01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:30.080]   up. You started just wanting, you spent more and more time in the environment.
[01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:36.640]   Yeah, but that's just where but AI comes in that kind of space too. When you think about this
[01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:41.280]   device that has almost really going to have cameras that are taking in the environment around it,
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:44.880]   just by virtue of the fact that you're walking around your office or walking around your house,
[01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:51.520]   it could be using it can be using neural radiance fields to be always building an updating a 3D
[01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:56.080]   model of your environment and inviting and inviting other people to share that environment with you.
[01:41:56.080 --> 01:42:02.320]   And we talked about this briefly last week where Google's Google's super demo super vapor where
[01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:09.920]   super realistic 3D video chat booth technology is about you don't you think that you're looking at
[01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:15.040]   video of somebody, but you're actually looking at a 3D model of them that's being that's being
[01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:20.480]   updated and redrawn from whatever perspective it needs to be at. So this is where we've there
[01:42:20.480 --> 01:42:25.680]   one of the minor news stories this week is about how Apple job listings have a lot of stuff for
[01:42:25.680 --> 01:42:30.160]   artificial intelligence researchers artificial people who are building practical things with AI.
[01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:34.960]   And yeah, that'd be nice if they updated Siri with something more conversational and that's one
[01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:39.840]   way they could leapfrog their competitors for the first time since the product really came out.
[01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:45.120]   But if they have this holistic approach that we can actually create these experiences that aren't
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:53.920]   just this weird, super smooth, super shaven version of Mark Zuckerberg this fixed face and virtual
[01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:59.840]   reality land, it's just that incidentally I didn't have to build this model of my living room it just
[01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:05.360]   simply exists because this is where I've been using this VR headset. I didn't have to create models
[01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:10.080]   of the people that I'm talking to because these things just happen to exist because of the fact
[01:43:10.080 --> 01:43:13.920]   that they've been using these VR headsets for so long. And then all of a sudden you're using
[01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:18.960]   iMessage and you think that hey great I've got this great HD virtual HD screen in front of me so I
[01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:24.480]   can actually be engaged in what I'm doing but I also have this chat but then there's a software
[01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:29.440]   update where there's a third icon where it's like would you like to actually be and have this person
[01:43:29.440 --> 01:43:33.680]   virtually in this shared space with you instead of in a square. That's the sort of stuff that
[01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:37.360]   it's going to have to be a holistic approach of everything and it's not something that we're going
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:43.120]   to see until all of these legos snap into place. I'll be really surprised if Memoji doesn't
[01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:49.280]   show itself in this. You know like I feel like they've been build not Memojis for a long time.
[01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:55.760]   Giant 2-Bemoji right there on top of your desk. But the Memojis, I mean Apple is the only company
[01:43:55.760 --> 01:44:01.200]   so far in my opinion that has figured out a way to build versions of ourselves that look cooler
[01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:05.760]   than ourselves because all the other ones look like kind of a weird dorky version of every
[01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:12.560]   part. I mean every other AR head is like wow that looks stupid. And I'm like I can do a stupid
[01:44:12.560 --> 01:44:17.200]   version of myself and my Memoji I'm like I wouldn't mind if I look like mine. Do you use it? And so
[01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:24.400]   sorry? Do you use it a lot? Yeah I use it a lot. I use it a lot. I use it too much. I use it to my
[01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:29.280]   family and friends and like that's how I do like instead of having a smile a lot times my little head
[01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:34.960]   or whatever and it's the thing that's on all my computers. Actually I use it as an emoji that
[01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:43.680]   looks like an emoji. I don't use it as much with video. To be honest if it was easier to export it
[01:44:43.680 --> 01:44:47.600]   I would probably use it a lot more. Like it's just that it's like this weird thing that's in
[01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:55.600]   clips or in messages. If they put it out, for instance if they had Memojis able to be exported
[01:44:55.600 --> 01:45:00.320]   and opened in motion or in Final Cut people would use it for all kinds of things. Maybe things they
[01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:06.880]   don't want it to be useful but that would be they would definitely be more useful.
[01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:12.160]   But I think that I feel like when I saw Memojis the first time I was like oh they're getting
[01:45:12.160 --> 01:45:16.000]   they're getting that ready for the headset. You know like that was immediately. I saw
[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:20.640]   a moment. I saw Memojis. I was like that's what you replace your head with and you get everybody
[01:45:20.640 --> 01:45:24.720]   working on it for years and you get them comfortable with the version that they have. And then when
[01:45:24.720 --> 01:45:29.280]   they see their friends with that on their head or whatever they're going to be comfortable with it
[01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:34.800]   because they've been seeing it for years. But I mean the moment I saw it I was like a good point
[01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:40.880]   with that. I know what that's for. I guess I'm just a grumpy old man. We'll find out. I mean I'm
[01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:47.920]   very much looking forward to June 5th and to see what it is. And I'm sure that I will be living in
[01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:53.280]   the reality distortion field for at least a little bit. The buzz and all that. Let's take a break
[01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:59.440]   when we come back. Your picks of the week my friends. But first I want to give a little plug
[01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:06.880]   to our great club club. Twit. This is one of the things Lisa came up with a couple of years ago
[01:46:06.880 --> 01:46:13.280]   as advertising started to dwindle during covid. And now of course with the debt ceiling default
[01:46:13.280 --> 01:46:20.080]   imminent advertisers are very very nervous about everything. We decided our unique international
[01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:27.680]   macroeconomic headwind. Yes. We decided maybe we should let our audience help support the network.
[01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:35.280]   And you have come forward with great gusto. And I'm so grateful to our 7000 club twit members.
[01:46:35.280 --> 01:46:40.000]   But I also know that's only about 1% of the total audience which means there's a lot of room
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:44.960]   for growth. So let me give you a pitch because if you're hearing this you're not a club twit member.
[01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:49.520]   I know that because club twit members you're no ads. That's the first thing you get for your
[01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:56.960]   $7 a month. An ad free version of every show we do including this one. You also get shows we don't
[01:46:56.960 --> 01:47:02.800]   put out anywhere else. Our hands on Mac and Tush show with Michael Sergeant or Paul Thorett's hands
[01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:08.320]   on windows of the untitled Linux show or Stacey's book club or brand new. This is another great
[01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:13.600]   thing we're able to bring back shows that in the past have not self supported. But the club can
[01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:18.960]   support like home theater geeks with Scott Wilkinson which is now back in the fold. We're really thrilled
[01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:25.440]   to have that and a whole lot more. We also have special events. We have a great discord which is
[01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:30.960]   full of wonderful people talking about not just the shows that are going on but everything in one's
[01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:36.240]   geek life. I'm sure in fact I'm pretty sure we have a AR VR section. I'm sure that'll be
[01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:43.040]   heating up pretty soon with all sorts of conversations. There's the club there's coding there's fitness
[01:47:43.040 --> 01:47:48.560]   there's music and movies and pets and a whole lot more. If you're not yet a member of club twit
[01:47:48.560 --> 01:47:54.080]   seven bucks a month you get all of that. I think it's a great deal. We have family plans. We have
[01:47:54.080 --> 01:47:59.520]   yearly plans. We have corporate memberships as well. Just go to twit.tv/club. Twit.tv/club
[01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:06.000]   and I would thank you in advance because we know you'll want to be a member and support what we do
[01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:13.680]   here. It really helps. It makes a huge difference. We appreciate it. Jason Snell let's kick things
[01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:19.200]   off with your pick of the week if you don't mind. I don't mind at all. That's why I put a pick in
[01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:25.040]   the document is because I in fact I love it. You have a pick. I do. Just out this week,
[01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:29.680]   Mime Stream version 1.0. I've been using this app. I think it's been a pick before.
[01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:34.000]   For a couple of years in beta they kept adding features. They kept saying we will let you pay
[01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:39.360]   forward at some point. That time is now. There's a special deal. It's a subscription thing and
[01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:44.560]   here's what it is. It's a Gmail client that is written entirely in Swift for macOS. If you use
[01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:50.080]   Gmail and you would like to use an email client that's made for it, not one that uses iMap to map
[01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:55.120]   mailboxes to tags and stuff like that, but something that uses everything that's in the native
[01:48:55.120 --> 01:49:01.040]   Gmail API. You can set filters and vacation messages. You can do very quick searches. My
[01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:05.680]   favorite thing, the reason that I keep using Gmail is of course, that's why Google's good at search.
[01:49:05.680 --> 01:49:11.600]   I can search all my messages from within Mime Stream and it's just as fast as searching within
[01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:16.800]   Gmail except I'm in the context of a Mac app instead of in the context of a web browser window.
[01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:21.920]   So since I switched to this a couple of years ago, I haven't looked back. It's a five person
[01:49:21.920 --> 01:49:26.800]   team led by Neil Zwveri who used to be on the mail team and the notes team at Apple.
[01:49:26.800 --> 01:49:33.360]   He has decided to go out on his own and make a really good standalone Mac app. They say their
[01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:39.200]   next step is going to be an iOS app, but they obviously they've just launched the Mac app at 1.0.
[01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:44.800]   But having used it for almost two years now, I can tell you it's really good. If you love your
[01:49:44.800 --> 01:49:50.960]   Mac and you love Mac native software and you use Gmail, it's got some really nice Mac stuff too.
[01:49:50.960 --> 01:49:55.920]   Like it supports focus filters. So like you can have multiple accounts and you can have them be in
[01:49:55.920 --> 01:50:00.640]   different profiles where your business profile has your three work Gmail accounts and your personal
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:04.960]   profile just has your personal. You can toggle between them. You go into a focus mode. It'll
[01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:10.240]   automatically toggle between them. Just a lot of really nice touches while also being a first
[01:50:10.240 --> 01:50:17.360]   class Gmail citizen which differentiates it from all of those email apps that are based on iMap,
[01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:23.520]   which is like the standard, but is weird with Gmail. And as a Gmail user, I just I love it. I
[01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:28.560]   have not looked back. I'm so glad that it's out and that I have signed up for my subscription to it
[01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:33.040]   because I wouldn't go back to any other client. Makes me jealous because I don't use Gmail and
[01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:39.840]   I would love it. But next on their list after iOS, they said probably support for iMap. But the
[01:50:39.840 --> 01:50:44.080]   problem is it's the exact opposite problem of most male clients in Gmail, which is you're trying
[01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:49.520]   to translate one metaphor into another. And they're not the same iMap and Gmail just aren't the same.
[01:50:49.520 --> 01:50:53.360]   So you have to kind of fake it. So if they do it, they're going to have to do the other thing and
[01:50:53.360 --> 01:50:57.520]   try to fake it the other direction. But iOS first for them. It's been beta for a couple of years.
[01:50:57.520 --> 01:51:05.680]   As Jason said, it is now official version 1.0 of MIME Stream free for 14 days than $30 for your first
[01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:13.840]   year, 50 for the second and subsequent years. MIMEstream.com if you want to look or just look on your Mac App Store
[01:51:13.840 --> 01:51:20.880]   for MIME Stream. But again, Gmail only just to be clear. Just just for Gmail. It is not I got some
[01:51:20.880 --> 01:51:25.040]   fan mail actually yesterday for where somebody wrote to me and said, thank you for calling it a
[01:51:25.040 --> 01:51:31.600]   Gmail client and not an email client. It's very important. It's not an email client. It is a Gmail
[01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:36.480]   client. It only works with Gmail. But if you're a Gmail user, you should check it out and a Mac
[01:51:36.480 --> 01:51:44.480]   user, you should check it out. Nice. Mr. Andy Inako, your pick of the week. My picklebeak is an old Mac game
[01:51:44.480 --> 01:51:50.560]   that has been rewritten to be new and work with Apple Silicon. It's Glypha. It's called Glypha
[01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:57.120]   Vintage. You can go get it at it on the scene gameplay. It's just it's just it's just but it's
[01:51:57.120 --> 01:52:01.600]   been available. It was one of the earliest really, really great games for the Mac. So yeah, it's a
[01:52:01.600 --> 01:52:07.040]   simple left button, right button to go left and right. Press the space to face bar to flap. Other
[01:52:07.040 --> 01:52:12.880]   people are also writing ostriches or whatever it is and with lances. So long as your lance is
[01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:17.520]   higher than the lance of the person you're bumping into, you win and you can scoop up an egg.
[01:52:18.560 --> 01:52:24.000]   Yours if there's as higher than yours, then you die. And you keep repeating that until it's time
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:29.680]   for your zoom meeting. But it's exactly the sort of game that I like. I'm not I don't have enough time
[01:52:29.680 --> 01:52:35.760]   for like weeks and weeks and weeks of these beautiful, wonderful, immersive, cinematic games.
[01:52:35.760 --> 01:52:40.800]   I just want something to have some fun with for about 10 or 15 minutes at a time and then maybe get
[01:52:40.800 --> 01:52:45.840]   sick of like in two months for four bucks. It's a lot of entertainment for those of you who are
[01:52:46.640 --> 01:52:51.360]   of a certain age, you will say, Oh my God, this is right. I'm right back in the computer lab in the
[01:52:51.360 --> 01:52:54.320]   high school and being told, Hey, you're not supposed to be playing games in here. You're supposed to
[01:52:54.320 --> 01:52:59.280]   be working on your turb paper. And I'm saying, go go to heck because I'm the person who keeps
[01:52:59.280 --> 01:53:03.200]   these things maintained. If you want me to get that printer schooler working again, you'll let
[01:53:03.200 --> 01:53:06.800]   me play another round of this. Sorry, sorry, sorry, specific Andy.
[01:53:06.800 --> 01:53:15.360]   I wasn't. I was a lot. You were there. I was like, you were there. Glypha vintage is on steam. So
[01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:20.880]   you can get it on your steam for damn dollars. Definitely worth it. It's really damn dollars.
[01:53:20.880 --> 01:53:26.000]   You know, I first saw just the simple screen. I thought, Oh, this is a dark castle, but it's
[01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:32.240]   it's kind of dark castle meets joust. It's an era. Yeah, it's an era where they had to make knock
[01:53:32.240 --> 01:53:36.240]   off so popular games because those games weren't available on the Mac and they all look kind of
[01:53:36.240 --> 01:53:40.640]   like dark castle, but this is the just one. Yeah, I can play it on windows. Same as if you wish.
[01:53:41.280 --> 01:53:46.480]   Liffa. Good pick. Thank you. Mr. Alex Lindsey. What's your pick this week?
[01:53:46.480 --> 01:53:50.320]   So I wasn't here. We're going to talk about it in the show. So I just waited until I like a
[01:53:50.320 --> 01:53:55.360]   couple things to stick in there. But but chat chat GPT is now available on iOS with its own app.
[01:53:55.360 --> 01:53:59.920]   Open AI has put it out. It's way better than going to the webpage. Like that's all I have to say.
[01:53:59.920 --> 01:54:04.400]   And if you have some other, you know, stupid version of it that all these people were using
[01:54:04.400 --> 01:54:08.560]   the API and trying to put some front end on it and doing every you should just get this one. It
[01:54:08.560 --> 01:54:12.160]   works. It's not there's nothing special about it. It doesn't do anything more than the webpage does.
[01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:17.440]   It's just way easier. Now you can open up and never ask you to log in. You can just, you know,
[01:54:17.440 --> 01:54:21.280]   you know, you know, I think you log in once or whatever, but then you're just using it.
[01:54:21.280 --> 01:54:25.600]   And it's just so much fun. You know, like I I don't I'm not trying to
[01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:32.240]   write a research paper with it. I'm just having it entertain me doing doing crazy things like
[01:54:32.240 --> 01:54:37.600]   making it fortune cookies. And I have my new obsession has been to ask it to do prompts for
[01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:45.680]   me. So I go like I'm looking. I said you are a designer and a prompt expert. I'm looking for a logo
[01:54:45.680 --> 01:54:50.800]   that is this and this that and I give it like a little thing. And then it creates this huge
[01:54:50.800 --> 01:54:55.680]   paragraph that I look at and go, I don't think this is going to work in mid journey. And because
[01:54:55.680 --> 01:54:59.920]   I tell it to do it for mid journey, it writes this thing for mid journey that is really long.
[01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:03.920]   And I put it in a mid journey and it looks great. And I'm just like, okay, the machines don't
[01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:11.040]   have to talk to each other. Exactly what the AI researchers were saying. What happens when we
[01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:16.880]   let these AI's like build their own railroad tracks to follow them. I'm already like waiting
[01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:22.160]   for the pipe that goes from chat to the end of mid journey. So I can say, Hey, chat to be tea,
[01:55:22.160 --> 01:55:27.120]   make me a I need a graphic that looks like this and then have it just iterate and then hand me
[01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:30.960]   back a couple hundred photos to look at like, what do you think of these? And then I select a
[01:55:30.960 --> 01:55:35.200]   couple and then it gives me a bunch more of those. And but so I'm waiting for that all to get tied
[01:55:35.200 --> 01:55:41.200]   in. But in the meantime, it is it's really fun. You know, it is again, I think that chat
[01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:45.920]   GPT is about as smart as a book smart person. And you know, it read a bunch of things and it's
[01:55:45.920 --> 01:55:49.520]   about as accurate as someone who just read a bunch of things and didn't actually ever do it.
[01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:54.640]   So I find it to be you know, I there's a little bit of a pinch of salt that I put on everything
[01:55:54.640 --> 01:56:00.800]   that it gives me. But it's not bad. Like it's and it's it's it's it's it's a lot of fun. And I just
[01:56:00.800 --> 01:56:07.600]   made another a new Osh soup, the generated by the one that's on the app there. So which is
[01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:13.920]   better than the last one. And so they which was good. Do you know, do you have to pay for chat GPT?
[01:56:13.920 --> 01:56:19.360]   Or I think I logged in and I have a user and it'll give you the free version, but it might take
[01:56:19.360 --> 01:56:24.240]   time for it to do it. I pay for it. So I I think that it might when you log in and mine.
[01:56:24.240 --> 01:56:28.960]   And is it using version four or is it using 3.5? You can switch to version four.
[01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:32.480]   So it has a little bit of fiber for. Okay. Yeah. So it's just like using the web
[01:56:32.480 --> 01:56:36.560]   and interface, but it's just like using the web interface except for that it's an app and it
[01:56:36.560 --> 01:56:40.560]   just runs a lot smoother. And you know, it the web interface was hard because occasionally it was
[01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:45.520]   going to ask you to log back in. It's like a weird web page and a little clunky. And this is just
[01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:49.520]   it isn't different, but it doesn't cost anything either. Like it's just a smoother,
[01:56:50.080 --> 01:56:55.280]   better interface for the one that you had before. It is number one in productivity, which cracks me
[01:56:55.280 --> 01:57:04.240]   up. So productive and then not productive at all. You can chat GPT from open AI.
[01:57:04.240 --> 01:57:08.800]   It's the official. Yeah. Yeah. What are you saying? I was just I haven't downloaded yet.
[01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:14.160]   Does it let you subscribe to chat GPT for like through the app? And is that and is that a way
[01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:21.440]   for Apple to benefit from from AI? 30% exactly. Exactly. I don't know. I already had it.
[01:57:21.440 --> 01:57:28.000]   Yeah, I don't I don't know. Just curious. Yeah. Not sure. Very good pick.
[01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:34.800]   Oh, be very aware if it gives you a quote wacky image prompt that looks like it might be a stack
[01:57:34.800 --> 01:57:40.160]   overflow buffer overflow exploit for something. Yeah, exactly. Maybe maybe take it back.
[01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:46.560]   Exactly. So I don't know if I think our title today is going to be Andy's Wild Thumb.
[01:57:46.560 --> 01:57:51.920]   I don't know if that will become a good prompt or not, but I'm going to let you find out.
[01:57:51.920 --> 01:57:57.040]   I'll let you play with that. And if you are watching the podcast at home or listening to
[01:57:57.040 --> 01:58:01.840]   the podcast, I'm looking at the album art. If it's Andy's Wild Thumb, then you know that Alex succeeded.
[01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:09.200]   Thank you, Alex Lindsey, Office Hours. Global is the place to go to see what's going on.
[01:58:10.240 --> 01:58:16.240]   You're doing all sorts of stuff now. This week is completely different than other weeks.
[01:58:16.240 --> 01:58:21.280]   Yeah. I mean, it just it's it's great. I mean, like, what is it? Subdivision surface.
[01:58:21.280 --> 01:58:26.080]   I don't even subdivision surfaces is basically how most things get modeled. So if you see a 3D
[01:58:26.080 --> 01:58:30.560]   model, most most 3D models on the web or anywhere are getting start off with subdivision surfaces.
[01:58:30.560 --> 01:58:36.240]   And so Alan Hawks has been an old friend of mine. I've known him for, you know, 15 years or so.
[01:58:36.240 --> 01:58:41.840]   And he does really high end, you know, surfacing and modeling and so on and so forth. So he came
[01:58:41.840 --> 01:58:46.880]   in and talked about that yesterday. We had Cynthia Drosda on who does she does woodturning.
[01:58:46.880 --> 01:58:51.200]   This looks so cool. Like Lays. She does online woodturning. And you know, Cindy,
[01:58:51.200 --> 01:58:56.400]   she's in our she's in our community and she's just so great. But I hadn't seen her in her
[01:58:56.400 --> 01:59:01.280]   environment. Like, like she, like I never seen and you're just like, she she goes, she's like
[01:59:01.280 --> 01:59:05.040]   talking about a little bit. And then she goes, here, let me show you how I do this. And she's been
[01:59:05.040 --> 01:59:09.440]   doing this for 10 years or maybe eight years or whatever. So suddenly she starts just
[01:59:09.440 --> 01:59:14.320]   seamlessly jumping between camera to camera with her key to over top of it and showing,
[01:59:14.320 --> 01:59:24.000]   you know, and it's a it's a incredible master's course on how to show people what you're teaching,
[01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:28.080]   you know, and for her, it's woodturning, but it could be a lot of other things.
[01:59:28.080 --> 01:59:31.760]   But she's so good at it. And it was really, really interesting to see her whole production.
[01:59:31.760 --> 01:59:36.400]   She's got like five or six cameras. And she's got a close up while she shows you the wide. And she's,
[01:59:36.400 --> 01:59:41.200]   you know, and she's, you know, she's green screen. You can see it here. Like, you can see her working,
[01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:44.320]   but you see the close up that's there. And she's got it. And it's all seamless. Like,
[01:59:44.320 --> 01:59:48.480]   she's got a stream deck and she's got V mix. And you know, it's not, you know, it's, it's a
[01:59:48.480 --> 01:59:52.960]   it's really intense. And so it was really interesting. And then we had last week, we had
[01:59:52.960 --> 01:59:55.840]   folks on from the NBC team talking about HDR.
[01:59:57.040 --> 02:00:02.240]   Talking about like how to think about this and, and, you know, and, and so on and so forth. So that
[02:00:02.240 --> 02:00:07.280]   was, you know, and we've just had it's just, we're starting to get into the zone. We just have one
[02:00:07.280 --> 02:00:11.520]   great, you know, one great second hour after another. So it's a lot of fun.
[02:00:11.520 --> 02:00:18.560]   Office hours. Global to find out more. And of course, if you want to hire Mr. Lindsey 090.
[02:00:18.560 --> 02:00:24.880]   Media 090. Media. Andy and Akko, when are you going to be on GBH next?
[02:00:25.760 --> 02:00:31.120]   I am on Friday at noon at the Boston Public Library. So if you're in Boston area, come on and drop
[02:00:31.120 --> 02:00:35.120]   by and watch the show live. Stick around and get a cup of coffee. You're going to cookie,
[02:00:35.120 --> 02:00:41.040]   which you will have to pay for both of them. Or you can listen to it live or later at wgphnews.org.
[02:00:41.040 --> 02:00:45.200]   Here's a man who knows how to pronounce Carl Jostremsky. That's all I can say. There you go. Yes.
[02:00:45.200 --> 02:00:52.720]   Y A S T R Z E M S K I. He even does that as a spell it. Wow. Jason Snell, he's a giants fan,
[02:00:52.720 --> 02:00:57.760]   but he's also the major domain at six colors.com also know how to spell
[02:00:57.760 --> 02:01:02.800]   just Dremsky, right? Because we got that in common now. Boston and San Francisco.
[02:01:02.800 --> 02:01:07.520]   He's on the team is grandson's on the team. That's right. That's great. I love that.
[02:01:07.520 --> 02:01:11.760]   Yeah, six colors.com. You read my thing about Final Cut and a little bit about logic and why I
[02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:17.040]   think it's not really suitable for podcast editing right now. And there's a I did a live stream earlier
[02:01:17.040 --> 02:01:21.680]   today. So there's like a half hour. You can watch me edit something in Final Cut Pro on the iPad
[02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:24.800]   where you can see the screen and you can also see my hands are on the screen.
[02:01:24.800 --> 02:01:30.960]   So that you do live stream on YouTube or Twitch. Yeah, YouTube. I've got a six colors YouTube
[02:01:30.960 --> 02:01:36.160]   channel. Twitch is a little too. I'm not doing it enough to build up a whole Twitch culture and
[02:01:36.160 --> 02:01:41.440]   you know, you got to have like a community and I'm not I'm not I don't do it enough for that. So
[02:01:41.440 --> 02:01:46.240]   it's just YouTube. It's easier and you got the setup, man. You're doing it. That's all I got a camera
[02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:53.920]   out there, man. I can I can switch. I can switch. Thank you, Jason Snell six colors.com. Thank you,
[02:01:53.920 --> 02:01:59.120]   Andy and not go. Thank you, Alex Lindsay. Thanks, most of all to you for joining us as you do. I

[02:02:52.720 --> 02:02:59.840]   I'm sorry put down that to chat GPT because it's time to get back to work. Break time is over.
