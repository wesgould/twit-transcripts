[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.240]   of imore.com
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.920]   Thank you so much for letting Georgia Dow use your studio on Sunday for Twit
[00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.080]   Oh, thank you. But now I mean, I'm gonna look like a polar alternative a per second place
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.400]   It was disorienting to see her sitting where you're sitting now
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.960]   Oh, I when I tried to do the show to daily
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.720]   Oh, I had to upgrade Skype and then I started asking me all these personal questions before I could use it
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.040]   So apparently now I was born in 1945
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.920]   And I have no idea what my birthday is if I get locked out
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.560]   It's just because I fed them up with the lies you lied to Skype. What's wrong with you?
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.560]   You devil you packalize
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.880]   And the anacos from the Chicago Sun times wearing now. This is a new hat. You'll have to tell us about this here
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.600]   Oh, well, this is this is the my
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.760]   Boston Marathon 2017 had bought in lieu of actually running the marathon
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:39.560]   Boston's strong ish I think is what we call Boston lazy, but supportive
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.360]   Also in studio. It's great to have Alex Lindsey from the pixel core
[00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.460]   You I know like your headphone jack. I'm thinking you did not upgrade to an iPhone 10. I did
[00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.840]   I'm still waiting and I I you did a server issue
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.080]   And on the west coast and I had to VPN into my DC facility to order
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:08.120]   But it took me three to five minutes to do that and to realize that yeah, and now I'm on I'm waiting like November 17
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.120]   No, I I have I
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.520]   Have gotten over it. So I'm gonna you know
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:19.000]   I after this show you may not you may you may be a little bit regret a renew
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.140]   I know I so I only want it for the for the not for the animoji but for the facial animation
[00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.720]   Right, I think that's cool
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:32.240]   I think there's gonna be a lot of opportunity there Renee has one I have one Andy has one and he's gonna have two when he gets his
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.920]   Review unit. I'm an Andy's problem. You have to you. Oh, let me see the space gray
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.720]   So you have this the white and the space gray
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.080]   Which one do you like better?
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.600]   You know, I ordered the space gray because it looks like such an object
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.280]   But then I agree with what Andy's been saying and that is the the silver the shiny shiny
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.920]   Stainless deal and this makes it look almost like an original iPhone from the front angle
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.640]   And I like that so much that I'm a little little bit sad. No, is that stainless?
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.880]   So it's not it looks like chromed. It's chromed, but it's actually stainless steel and the black one is
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.600]   Vapor-coated stainless steel is very similar to what they did with the watches. I
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:10.560]   Okay, so I mocked you last week. Oh, I'm sure yes. I mocked you last week
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.920]   Because you said it's the best damn product Apple's ever made
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.720]   Okay, you were right. I
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.680]   Say it here. I've had it since I
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:27.520]   Would argue that I let the 10.5 inch iPad was better than the iPhone 8 and AirPods might have been just better as a product than iPhone 7
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.080]   But I think of everything Apple's released this year and going back
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.660]   This is just it's it's such a well designed like it just the
[00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.600]   Feeling in your hand. I think pans we noticed that it's like an Apple watch made into a phone
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.840]   Just a critically interesting it is kind of isn't it?
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:46.640]   But I now Alex is looking at now the first time I've touched it. Yeah, the screen is
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.960]   Spectacular and by the way display meals. It just it feels like you spend a lot of money on it
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.680]   That's all I'm saying it's what you did. Yeah, you did and evidently it turns out
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.800]   There's a lot of people that are willing to spend a lot of money on a phone. Yeah, the upward price elasticity is amazing
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:06.600]   Yeah, there was something we talked about this on Sunday on on Twitter. There's something about that one thousand dollar barrier
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.160]   It's not that it is that I mean so a few hundred dollars more expensive than your previous phone
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.760]   It's and that's a few hundred bucks amortized over a couple of years
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.160]   It's not the end of the world but but but something about psychologically about going through that thousand dollar
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.000]   I asked people in line and most of them were like cost how much I don't know
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.360]   I'm getting it for 20 or 30 bucks a month and that was that's the only number they saw that's really what Apple's done
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.400]   That's I think smart there. Yeah. Yeah, and the twenty three bucks a month
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.080]   Is really is that all right?
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:40.960]   Well, sir, I don't know the US price I think it's more than that over for how many years
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.960]   You know that normally to two year. It's you give it back though. So you don't own it
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.960]   That's the whole thing is you're basically a missing model
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:52.560]   I think I did the math and I think it ends up being like thirteen hundred dollars instead of twelve hundred something like that
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.840]   You know the Apple more gram one should the the Apple one should be zero rated
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.480]   So it should be like leasing a car for zero percent interest. Oh
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:03.040]   Over the only negative on that is if you've damaged it your script
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:05.440]   Well, you get Apple care plus
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.600]   Automatically with it so you get to incident. You know, I would probably have to do I should I don't know why didn't do that
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.960]   That actually sounds like a smart way to do it. So you're not paying extra. You're just spreading it out
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:19.320]   Yeah, and you get Apple care plus I'm not good with diamonds. So I just buy everything I do to like I'm just like oh
[00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.160]   I'll miss a payment. Well, I'll be honest most of the time with the phone
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.160]   I use it for a few months than the next phone
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:30.480]   Totally I don't I have to feel like I'll be using this playmate and the display on this one
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:36.560]   I can't get over it. So display mate said it's practically textbook in terms of color accuracy
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.040]   The best screen they've ever looked at
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:44.200]   You know and I trust these guys they scenario does a very good a color accurate monitor
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:50.960]   But then I decided just to get an iPhone one of the things they said is that they have managed to cut to calibrate each device
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:58.400]   accurately, right? Yeah, they're doing individual sub pixel level calibration across every unit would and you need for color management
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.280]   But a lot of pieces just aren't set up to do it. Well, I think we talked about this that the the problem with a pixel
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.480]   2xl is this batch
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:12.000]   color calibrated and so there'll be some significant variation in different units but in this
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:21.280]   Displaymate said close to textbook perfect calibration and performance superbly accurate high performance gorgeous display
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:27.200]   Um, you know now apples quick to say it's still an OLED it's an OLED
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:34.960]   Burnin is always gonna be an issue. We suggest apple says you turn the screen off time to its lowest setting 30 seconds
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:42.480]   We highly recommend you use automatic screen dimming. Oh, Alex is looking in a movie
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.120]   Is it it's uht?
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:51.520]   It's hdr Dolby vision and hdr 10 dead. It's funny. I watched deadpool on my new apple 4k apple tv
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.160]   How do look because it gets you ought to get automatically upgraded?
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.540]   New earthly looks good even hdr and t
[00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:00.160]   Netflix stuff is amazing because the marvel the marvel Netflix stuff is all muddy
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.600]   But you watch it in hdr and suddenly there's color everywhere. It's amazing
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:08.400]   Uh, and the blacks are very nice. I watched a stranger things. There's a scene
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:16.320]   No spoiler at all, but there is a scene and stranger things where uh two people are brightly lit in a black room a dark room
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:19.760]   And in hdr that black is black. There's no
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:26.320]   Interfacting there's no banding it is it is lights out and because of it they pop out of the screen
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:28.720]   So it's 3d without any 3d
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:35.760]   You know i was talking to someone uh while i was actually talking to uh colleen about compression calling kelly. Yeah, yeah, and um
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.480]   And she's the expert now
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.320]   The world expert our chief engineer here
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:46.000]   And then she went to google and then now she's a facebook and she is the world expert in everything having to do with video
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.080]   I think right absolutely. Yeah, it's pretty impressive. She's where I go I go for school
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.320]   You know and that's saying a lot
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.160]   I mean you're my expert. So no no
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.880]   Like I I go over I spent a lot of time with and she
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:01.920]   I can only handle a couple hours at a time before I get a headache, you know just trying to absorb the information
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:04.800]   But is this off youtube where are you watching deadpool? That's off of itunes
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:09.520]   Of your soft my iTunes that you're up. So this is the upgraded 4k hdr
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.640]   And I I really think that yeah, it's great
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:17.040]   But you're saying you know one of the things that that her opinion is is if you're gonna do 4k or hdr
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.160]   You might not just throw a lot of bandwidth at people because the
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:26.160]   The if they have a 4k tv 4k hdr tv they probably have a good internet connection
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.880]   You know, there's like this like yeah, I do buy that if you don't have that
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.360]   Right, so the best thing about the iphone is you don't have to worry about the hdmi
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:37.440]   Because right now hdmi cables are causing the most headaches for everybody just to get 4 4 4 out of from the source to the television
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:40.400]   It's like playing roulette whether your cable will work or not
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:44.160]   But it just works on an iphone because there's no cable involved and a lot of it's the the run by the way
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:49.680]   We've been doing 4k for a long time with monitors and it turns out how long that run is is a big deal
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:52.640]   Interesting, you know, you have to we find it and some of the high ones aren't shielded Alex
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.800]   Which is causing all sorts of problems for people. Yeah. Yeah, the we find that over six feet
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.960]   It's that's when it really becomes an issue
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:04.160]   Of whether it's gonna work or not, but um, but yeah, so I mean like my home connection now
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.360]   I mean tests it like except for yesterday when Comcast went down
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:10.080]   Yeah, well, that was weird. What? Yeah
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:14.400]   Yeah, so let me let me show you this is probably a good shot as any
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:18.880]   For high dynamic range because there's a brightly lit sky in the background
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:23.040]   I don't actually see any detail in the sky, but I do see detail in the white tent
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:28.160]   Behind it. And of course, there's plenty of detail in the black jacket the t-shirt
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:32.800]   This this is a kind of a good example of high dynamic range in video. That'd be interesting to get
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.280]   Wait, I think I can download what where are you?
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:41.280]   It's also depending on the studio because they get to choose which version of 4k they give you and whether it is true hdr
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:44.960]   True 4k or up sampled. Yeah, so there is some variance in the well
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:50.640]   Shot in just it's funny that you picked dead pull because that's what I picked at random to take a look at the 4k
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:53.520]   H uh d hdr
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:55.840]   Yeah, it's a great movie and I happen to own it
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:01.040]   But even just demoing while I'm in the one-on-one and the icons the text
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:07.120]   And of course anybody at home seeing this is not seeing it because we stream 720p if you're watching the video
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:13.040]   And if you're listening the audio you're really not seeing it, but just in the hand it it really does look superb
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:17.520]   The amazing thing is if you put your old iPhone next to it, it looks the same like the icons don't look different colors
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:23.760]   No, and that actually is amazing because typically in fact I compared it on another show to a note eight screen
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:30.960]   I compared the red and the authy red is always a challenging for any video right red in the authy icon to the note eight
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:38.400]   And the note eight had a pink tinge to it. It was a little poppier and brighter. This is very it's a very real natural red
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:45.280]   It's perfect as far as I can tell and that just as you know throughout uh, very well and you don't have to trust our
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:48.160]   Limited eyeballs
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.040]   And there's there's I think there's a couple of differences here
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.160]   One of them is that this is gonna be your if you're not been iPhone user
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.320]   You're probably been one for like five or six years
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:01.680]   This is gonna be your first OLED screen and so you're gonna get a dramatic improvement over what you've seen before
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:06.240]   Uh, if you are going from an android phone like I am
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:11.040]   It's not quite so it wasn't quite so dramatic for me. I thought it was very very nice
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:14.240]   It didn't blow me away, but I could certainly appreciate how good it was
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:18.800]   But just in case you're you're being scared off. I oh well. I don't have hdr content
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:20.400]   I don't care about hdr
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.320]   On the train ride to new york city yesterday
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:27.200]   I was actually watching an episode of colombo that I ripped from dvd over the weekend
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:35.840]   And even that was just a really satisfying amount of detail and color even for a dvd quality rip of a tv show that was
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:40.320]   That was filmed in 1974. So yeah, you're you're going to be really really happy with it
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:44.640]   We're gonna. Alex is trying to pull up the same frame on his uh, iphone
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.800]   Six s
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:52.080]   Just to compare it. That's an lcd screen apple's always done good screens there lcd's nothing is that either
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:58.000]   All led can be challenging because the temptation with all that is to make it brighter and popular and it's an immature technology
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.280]   And it can be the absolute worst panel on earth if you don't do it very carefully. I have the 4k
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:09.920]   You can also it's not necessarily a bad thing to actually see significant differences in the same scene
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:12.800]   It actually looks a little brighter on the success
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.520]   But in terms of detail
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:21.760]   What what's interesting is it's because it's brighter you're seeing more detail on the success above it
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.880]   We should we should turn your screen down or mine up
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:33.120]   Well hdr also kind of can save you energy because you do tend to overdrive the screen because you want to see details that are hidden in shadow
[00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:38.480]   Rusty hdr screen will show you that detail even if you've got the backlight or the lighting of the brightness of the screen turned down
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.880]   So i think even people with a
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.520]   I tend to turn mine up
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:46.960]   To to 11 most 10 to 11
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:52.960]   You can go to 11 and it's interesting is even though I turned up the brightness the blacks are still inky and there's not a lot of detail on it
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.720]   So I don't know I don't know
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:14:01.920]   I I prefer the bottom one, which is the iphone 10, but yeah, I think it looks more at well number one is it looks less blue
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:05.040]   Yeah, it looks more natural and it looks more natural and then home
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:11.280]   You're not seeing the difference at all by the way. Just look at the guy's head the flesh tone in the bald guy's head is so much better
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:13.360]   It's a lot
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:17.440]   Vision are different like go be vision does very careful frame by frame hdr
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:23.120]   Where I think hdr 10 does align through the entire video to calibrate it still be vision or h-10
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:29.520]   I'm not sure. I know that it does he does both, but I don't know. Yeah, so does the iphones. Okay. Yeah, it does both
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:33.520]   Okay, so it depends on who what marvel the studios get to pick
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.360]   Yeah
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:41.440]   And also I also want to make people who bought the iphone 8 and iphone 8 plus not feel quite so bad if they are now
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:49.360]   Think oh god did I screw up? I also find that it's again side by side between like the galc s8 the iphone
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:54.160]   10 and the iphone 8 you can definitely see the difference between screens
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:15:00.320]   I don't think that any one of these on there that any of the other screens on their own look poor
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:06.080]   It's sometimes when you when you're in a when you were a reviewer and you do have access to every phone made
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:10.160]   So don't don't feel like as though the iphone 8 is an inferior screen. It's excellent
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.400]   I've been carrying that one around for two or three weeks now
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:16.560]   And even even after using the iphone 10 as my daily drive versus friday
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:20.000]   I was using the iphone 8 as a video video recorder
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.280]   During my stuff on new york yesterday and it still didn't look terrible even when I was switching between those two
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:29.760]   Alex tell me what we're looking at this is the display mate colored gamut
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.080]   chart
[00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:39.440]   Uh the the blue is sRGB and of course as you'd expect p3 dc i p3 is slightly larger the cinema gamut
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:45.920]   Uh, and then is the white line the iphone because it's bigger than all of them and it certainly matches up here and i
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:50.880]   Is that the human eye? Okay. Yeah, so where's the i guess the iphone is not on this?
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:55.920]   I don't know the iphone isn't the is all those black are these iph3 is red. Yeah, so those dots
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:16:01.280]   So that's outside of what it matches very accurately in fact right to the p3
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.800]   Is what i was that's what they're saying
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.240]   Right
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:11.440]   A close match to the standard gamuts. Oh, all right. Okay, so those dots are measurements
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:16.640]   I would yeah you can vary like the pixel 2 only does I think 95 or 96 of p3 and the pixel 2 excel
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:19.840]   Does 100 of p3 so it can vary depending on the individual phone too
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:26.160]   Anyway, I don't know anything about this stuff. So i'm just and then there's rec 2020 leo and sRGB and his
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.560]   color accuracy
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:30.560]   the uh the uh
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:35.280]   I don't know. I don't know anything about so you guys have to look at it and decide for yourself
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:37.360]   It's graphs and numbers. It looks good
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:42.720]   I got very try angle on the other one. It's not quite so big
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.960]   It's the try angle on the first one
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:48.880]   Yeah, to andy's point they're both iphone 8 and iphone 10 both have incredibly good displays
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:54.880]   The difference with the old ed is it let them go edge to edge because they could literally fold the panel around and put the display controllers underneath it
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:17:02.560]   And it also when you tilt them past 30 degrees led lcd will just get sort of darker where old ed in this case will shift blue
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:06.560]   Right slight blue shift. It's noticeable not on this screen
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:11.920]   But if I put a white screen, let me put the calendar up. You'll see the slight blue shift, but it's not bad
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:16.720]   It's just very you can still read. Yeah, I really think that apple found the right balance here
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:20.080]   If you if you paid extra for the iphone 10 you will appreciate the difference
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:24.960]   If you decided that the iphone 8 was good enough for you, you won't notice any
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:28.320]   You won't you won't be disappointed with that display either. It's not as well
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:32.480]   You're getting a cut rate experience. You're just getting a slightly better one that again
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:38.720]   It might cause some arguments if you are if you and your spouse are in every other year
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:43.760]   We buy the new phone and whoever else gets the old phone that might cause some our arguments there
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:50.160]   But other than that, I think that I think you're still up to do what are the features the iphone 8 and a plus good enough for you
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:55.600]   And do you not want to spend a thousand dollars for the 64 gigabyte version of this?
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:00.480]   I think I think I think it's the camera and the face facial recognition and not not really the facial
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:05.280]   Being able to unlock your phone. I think what we're going to see over the next year is a lot of development
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:10.800]   Of taking having a lot of fun with people's faces. If you think an emoji karaoke is annoying. That's just getting people
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:15.760]   Get ready kids. I think I do think that there is going to be
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:21.280]   A point where you can make actual professional content from your phone
[00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:27.280]   You know one of the big things that's kept that from working really well is facial animation and being able to now
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:30.480]   Just literally grab your phone and animate all your characters is
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:35.200]   Not shouldn't be seen as trivial. I mean that's that's a big that's a huge feature
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.600]   You could make return to the planet of the apes
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:39.200]   Well, you can do anything it's not
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:43.120]   And dirty we're not talking about we're not talking about like like feature films
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:48.960]   You know what I'm talking about is that if you want to do commentary or comic commentary on youtube or you know all kinds of
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:53.840]   No more do we have to use hitler from downfall we can we can make our own hitler videos?
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:19:00.800]   Well, I mean the thing the thing we haven't even you know if you look at the merge of that and the ability to manipulate video using
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:06.160]   You know 3d you literally could get to a point where you could pick up your phone and reanimate someone talking
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:11.360]   I think we've all seen obama say other things than what he said or yeah, you're right. Okay, so you could have a
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.360]   Jfk head model in this phone that would just well you even have a JFK head model
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:20.560]   You just have to have the representation as it applies to that
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:23.200]   You know, so basically you analyze some footage
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.760]   It will build that internally of what needs to happen
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:32.640]   And then you could literally just pick up your your phone and start talking and who someone else on the other video will just be saying what
[00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:36.480]   What you wanted them to say we have us in remotely is an emoji Leo
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:44.320]   And emoji Rene and out and and the on either side did you see the clips thing that apple put up on the website for the new version of clips app that's coming soon
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:45.280]   No
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:49.040]   This is why I always thought that they have digital they have a portrait lighting and portrait mode
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:52.800]   The next thing would be portrait backgrounds and I thought we'd get that with iOS 12 next year
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:55.280]   But they've built it into clips. It's got these scenes
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:59.680]   They showed them at the iPhone demo last month where you can put yourself inside the millennium falcon
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:04.000]   It's a 360 degree millennium falcon that you can turn around in if you go right back up a little bit
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.800]   It's just it's like the hologram on the yeah right there
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:10.640]   You can put yourself in like a blade runner Tokyo the millennium falcon
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:16.400]   Whatever that bridge is and it's a complete world that you turn around in and you're superimposed into wow
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.880]   That's using the true depth camera as well
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:24.160]   Yeah, because it pulls you pulls a depth data then differentiates you from the background and creates virtual background that comes out
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:26.560]   day after tomorrow that's soon
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:30.640]   So 11 9 that will be available. So that's gonna be yeah
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:35.760]   I would I would love to see apples do stuff as a demo anyway showing what that true
[00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:40.080]   Face camera can do and then let love to see third parties
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:45.360]   And I think is there an AR like AR kit like interface for it, uh Renee
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:49.760]   For the for the face ID for the true depth for the depth
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:52.720]   Yeah, so it's just a part of AR kit now so you get the face matching
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:53.520]   Oh, okay
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:57.200]   As part of AR kit because I'm just thinking AR is being looking out
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:01.280]   This is looking in but I guess well it contracts you into AR environment
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.440]   So basically it takes the depth data and tracks your face
[00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:08.240]   But the other thing that's really cool about this is the attention awareness that's built into it because it can tell when you're looking at it
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:12.880]   So it'll do things like your you're you get a private message and it knows you're looking at the phone
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:18.640]   It'll unfurl that message and you can tap and go right to it or the phone rings and you pick it up and it realizes that you're looking at it
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.600]   So it dims the ringer and right now they're very simple examples
[00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:25.200]   But once once the phone knows that you're you're in possession and doing things with it
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:29.920]   It can start doing a bunch of contextualy aware things for you as well. I'm gonna get one step closer to
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:35.200]   Somebody asked me on the radio show how come my phone gets quieter when I pick it up
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:39.680]   And I said, oh, that's that's a new feature. That's in the settings you could turn it off
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:42.160]   But it's part of the attention settings. Yep, and I
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:48.880]   Yeah, this is just a little bit of a taste of what could potentially and again. I think I think that over next year
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:53.840]   Um over the next year. I think we're gonna see an explosion of tools that are used that aren't just
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.240]   animated poop
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:58.960]   You know, I hope so. I think there's gonna be a lot of
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:04.000]   That's a lot of opportunities to use this in a more useful way and I and it's gonna be really interesting
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.720]   And I think that the next version my guess is the next version is gonna take
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:08.400]   the
[00:22:08.400 --> 00:22:14.080]   Information that they're using to get your face and put it on the other camera and go out and then that that gets that kind of backs them into
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:19.360]   A real AR solution, you know that that that is much closer to what tango was doing
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:22.800]   It's pretty I mean, it's just uh, eye tracking is pretty
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:27.040]   It's it's pretty interesting to think about what they could do just with eye tracking
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:31.200]   Just with the user interface if they know where are you looking at at this moment?
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.200]   What has your attention right now?
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:36.160]   And I'm not talking about like I'm I'm using a mouse with my mind
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:40.080]   It's a pointer is moving where my eye is but just it it into it's that wow
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:44.880]   This guy is really confused because his eyes are darting all over the screen right now as if he's looking for something
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:51.760]   Maybe I will use that information to surface a feature that is kind of buried in the interface right now or even if the
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:58.640]   For betas of an app if developer wants to enable a tracking mode and simply say that please keep an eye tell me
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:02.560]   Give me give me a heat map of where people are looking in my interface
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:08.240]   And if you're thinking that wow, I really thought the most important place for to put this feature is going to be the upper right hand corner
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:13.520]   But they're not that's not where people are looking. Okay. I know I know I got to put the most important stuff on the left edge
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:20.240]   Kind of close to the bottom. It's it's it's my it's my favorite kind of feature where it's not the one thing
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:25.440]   It's not like it unlocks your phone and that's what it does. And if you once you're past that it stops being cool
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:27.840]   It's where you just tell a whole
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.800]   Hundreds of thousands or millions of developers
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:36.000]   We have a technology so that it can read a face in 3d and tell you what is happening with that face
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.400]   Do whatever you want with that feature?
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:41.440]   That's when you start the really cool stuff is going to happen in five or six months
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:47.280]   Where we see all these new apps from people who are finally getting their phones and can finally develop things without a simulator
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:49.280]   finally
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.280]   Finding the awesome on their own
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:53.760]   Yeah
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:56.240]   I have to say face ID works quite reliably
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:24:00.240]   Now I turned off actually I just turned off
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:05.760]   The attention feature because the way it works is by default is you have to look at it with your eyes open
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:08.320]   When you turn it off it works even faster
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:13.360]   Is there a band for more angles? Yeah, is there a big security issue with that? I feel like yeah
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:15.360]   So I mean this the the security issue with it is it
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.440]   Let's say like Alex grabs your phone and holds it up to your face
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:21.040]   If he can get it to see your eyes nose and mouth that'll unlock for him big deal
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:27.760]   Or somebody could do it while i'm asleep big deal. Yes. I don't I so if you trust the people around you which I do yes
[00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:31.280]   Uh, it sure makes it faster. I don't have a problem with it
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:34.000]   Anyway, and if you don't you can squeeze it and that'll force pass code
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.320]   If you're like falling asleep on a train and you don't want people around you to get your phone just squeeze it for a second
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:41.360]   Yeah, squeeze both sides. You both buttons on either side
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:43.680]   I
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:48.320]   I didn't like and I think I mentioned this last week the idea that I had to swipe up after face ID worked
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:56.160]   But face ID is so transparent and quick that really it feels like you're unlocking the phone by swiping up because yeah, it's just yeah, that's just instant
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:02.000]   That's something that's something I really noticed I was it was bumming me out for the first couple of days because I was expect I was
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.360]   Instinctively using it where I glance at it. I look at I look at the lock
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:11.040]   I'm making it's unlocking and then I swipe up and thinking that oh gosh
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:15.280]   This is it's actually slower than face ID or I really hate that it's a two-step thing
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:17.840]   It took me a few days to start to trust it enough just
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:21.600]   I was actually just telling myself inside my mind
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:27.040]   Don't wait. Just hold it. Just just use it as you would normally would and just act as though there's no lock in this
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:28.960]   And you just have to swipe up
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:34.560]   And that was uh, I'm slowly starting to trust it and it's it's really starting to pay off very well
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:38.640]   But you can actually swipe that's before that something would lock opens. Yes, exactly
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:43.040]   It's the realization that it unlocks but and then it animates to confirm that it's unlocked
[00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:48.240]   And so it's it's best to use it just like as you would touch ID assume it's going to work
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:52.320]   And be ready for the occasional what the hell is going on. It's not unlocking
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:57.520]   But for for the for the first time just assume it's going to work and then you will not experience a delay
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:00.240]   I'm he asked. I never want to go back to a physical home button
[00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:06.800]   It's actually an improvement. I used I launched one password and it I'm it opened without me even knowing what was going on
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:10.240]   Like why is it? Oh face ID? I love that by the way
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:16.320]   At that moment leo. I mean god helped me a touch ID felt felt cumbersome. It's like i'm too lazy to even touch ID
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:20.800]   Yeah, it's just doing stuff. I wouldn't say I wouldn't I wouldn't agree that strongly
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.800]   I think it works exceptionally well
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:29.040]   I do even and this is this is someone speaking with all the expertise of having had this for five days
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:34.720]   Uh, I kind of like the fact that unlocking the phone via touch ID is an overlapping action
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:38.240]   Where like a particular particularly on my android phone where it's mounted on the back
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:39.840]   So while i'm taking it out of my pocket
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:45.600]   My finger just happens to hit that place and I know that by the time it is anywhere near where I want to use it
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:51.520]   It's unlocked. So essentially the act of taking it out of my pocket is identical to the act of unlocking you so to speak
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:57.200]   It's a little bit different when at some point after you look at it. It's going to unlock
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:02.080]   It's so it's it's it's it's hard. It's hard to really explain. I don't think it's a fault
[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:07.760]   But that's why I would go I would not I think they're two different technologies both of which work exceptionally well
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:11.520]   It's certainly I think if apple I think apple is going to gain the most
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:12.480]   uh
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:17.120]   Saturation from this simply by the point of view that they're releasing it in the first week of november
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:20.240]   The first week that people are now wearing gloves every day
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:22.480]   And that's what's going to get people to say you know what?
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:27.680]   I was on the fence until I remember how many times if to take off my gloves or use a stylus or use the
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:29.680]   Skesky mask now Andy
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:33.360]   Yeah, take article arctic and ski mask article in fast companies design site
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:38.000]   By hesus ds says the iphone 10 is a user experience nightmare
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.240]   How did we go for the most elegant user experience ever created to this mess?
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:44.960]   This is where hesus ds ended up
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:52.160]   Uh, he uh, he shows joanna stirns
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:59.520]   Quick one sheet on how to use it, which is actually very useful to wake up the screen tap anywhere to open the control center
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:04.880]   Swipe down from the right ear notifications left ear how to do a special like a konami code now leo
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:10.800]   But I have to say as confusing as you might I don't feel like this is confusing is but but when you look at it printed like this
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:16.400]   You might say oh, yeah, but yeah, it is so intuitive and natural. I can't agree. I think
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.880]   And by the way, I want to say
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:23.680]   I want to cop to the fact that I wanted to hate this phone. I wanted to be well
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:31.120]   I was very suspicious of all new user id dropping touch id which worked so nicely
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:33.520]   It looks different than it feels like when you have it in your hand
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:35.680]   It's not the same as when you're just looking at it on a screen
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:42.480]   I did not want to come to this I was not prepared psychologically to say this was a good phone and particularly because of the price I
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:44.000]   I felt bad
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.160]   Telling people all you really want to get a phone that starts at a thousand bucks
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:50.640]   It's it
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:54.800]   What can I say it it I don't think there's a single place it didn't check all the
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:56.560]   Mark it's I will great
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:29:03.680]   I will say that I think it's really important when you're reading reviews particularly the negative ones that I think that no phone since the first
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:07.440]   iPhone is so dependent on experience
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:12.000]   I think that in two people who have been using this every day for two or three weeks are going to have a different
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   Different opinion than they did after two or three days
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:20.400]   Not the two or three days is ever enough to do review, but sometimes it's what you have to do
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:26.080]   Um, I'm still kind of on the fence about application switching. I really
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.760]   I
[00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:34.320]   I'm not I have not trained my thumb correctly to reveal the deck of cards and swipe to the map
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:37.440]   I want somebody I've told me a better way to do this watch this
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:43.360]   So this is I was going and holding swiping up and holding you don't have to you just swipe
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:45.840]   No, oh, I'm not having a drag. It said. Yeah
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:50.560]   You just go like that. Yeah, it's a it's a left it's a right and you can go sideways
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:53.360]   You don't have to bring up the multitasking to switch apps. You can just swipe sideways
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:55.280]   And this is phenomenal
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:30:01.920]   This is so it used to be you to force touch the left side and swiped over now you just swipe the bottom
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:06.000]   It is so much of a better experience so much of a natural
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:13.600]   This is a massive improvement. Yeah, and also remember that if you go into the iBook store, you will find a manual
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:18.000]   A really nice extremely well written extremely well illustrated manual
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.200]   I haven't I've downloaded if I haven't read it yet because again for
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:28.480]   My first week and I just want to have the user experience of no external information yet, but it is it's just
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:33.680]   It's not less of a complaint about how it works than an understanding that again
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:37.040]   You had to learn a lot of new stuff when you got the first iphone
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:43.520]   This is the first the lack of the home button the first iphone without a home button means that there's a lot of stuff that you're
[00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:50.720]   Gonna have old behaviors that are no longer useful and new behaviors that are as good and if not better than what you're replacing it with
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:55.840]   You probably don't be thrown. You probably wouldn't want to go back and forth. Although I've been going back for
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:58.400]   iPad to an iphone 10
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:02.400]   I'm going back and forth iphone 8 and I'm pulling up control center all the damn time
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:03.280]   Yeah
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:10.160]   So you really want to pick one UI and it's weird that apple has effectively three ios uis now one for the ipad one for the older
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:15.200]   iPhones one for the iphone 10 so I asked them about that and they said they didn't want to check for people the whole point of iphone 8 was that
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:21.680]   To give a familiar experience to people something that they were used to and they they didn't think the consistency between iphone 10 and iphone 8
[00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:27.440]   Was as important as a consistency between you know iphone 5 all the way up to iphone 8 for people who were just upgrading to that one
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:34.000]   Now you think that they'll have an iphone like do you think that they'll continue the iphone phone 8 line like to iphone 9 or whatever
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.320]   This is really the last one right this is
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.200]   The last one of that of that generation
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:45.440]   My big question is when they come out with two iphone 10s next year is one going to be smaller and then this one or is going to be this one and a bigger one
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:52.480]   I'm i'm interested to see how it will feel to have a larger how would feel to have a larger one of these it's a little bit
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:32:00.800]   As without the without the screen the screen being shoved up a full centimeter inside your hand when you're holding it
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:05.360]   The bottom is a little bit more awkward to get to particularly if you're trying to run hand it
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:09.040]   I'm curious to see what it would be like if they decided to make a larger one
[00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:12.080]   It would be it would be an interesting way to do
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:14.480]   um sort of a
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:22.000]   Sort of a take on the ipad mini if they wanted to do like the ipad nano where we're not talking about crazy stupid big
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:30.560]   Big iphone here, but if you're saying let's take the frame size of the iphone 8 plus and try to go edge to edge oled like this
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:33.760]   That would be super interesting. That's the sort of thing that would make me
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:40.320]   I have a I do have a collection of pocket keyboards and there have been times where I have been forced by circumstance
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:44.880]   To be the guy sitting in a room at the family event writing something
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:50.320]   On 45 minute deadline because the world changed while I was in the car to the function the vfw function hall
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:58.800]   If you make it the put a screen that big inside an iphone 8 frame that now becomes a practical
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:02.800]   Productivity space so I would like to see them try to do that
[00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:05.600]   I'm sure they've already built them but and they're waiting for the right moment or
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:07.120]   They've already laughed it off
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:14.160]   But that's that would be that would be a new thing a really new thing when I find what I find amazing is as how apple can
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:17.320]   Consistently take something that was perfectly fine make it look
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:24.240]   Car companies figured this out. They would that's why we put fins on Cadillac
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:29.600]   I know but but but but it's not it's always like it's like it is like I have the most modern phone
[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:32.080]   This phone is horrible
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:35.200]   This is the biggest leap forward though that it is it is
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:39.040]   What I what I just noticed is how clunky, you know the last factor
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:42.560]   You don't want to use the and what I and I felt like the the smaller
[00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:46.880]   Phone the non plus uh was too small and I felt like this one
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:48.560]   I've always felt like this one was a little too big
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:53.360]   This is the sweet spot and I and I do think that the x is in the in in the sweet spot for me
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:57.600]   It's got the right screen real estate. My hand is much more comfortable over it. I yeah
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:02.480]   It's I hate to put a case on it. However, I know given the cost of
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:05.040]   repairs
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:11.920]   I already ordered the I don't have the phone yet. I have the case I have the little cover which which case though the silicon the leather the folio third
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:18.400]   I I started with the well first of all I don't do apple cases, but I but I started with the spigant just the rubber
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:21.520]   bumper plus back
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:25.600]   But I have to say I'm concerned about the front it's 270 bucks to fix the front
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:28.960]   So I'm actually doing what you're doing Alex interestingly enough. I got a wallet case
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:33.280]   I like the wallet because I if I I don't have to carry a wallet and I lose my phone
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:37.520]   But up they're both in the same place. I never lose and that now so that covers the front and the back
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:40.880]   This is a cheap one 30 dollar one from Davis. I'm pretty
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:45.120]   I've ordered well, you know what I ended up doing I ordered like four of them all different features
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:51.040]   The one thing that this doesn't have that I kind of want is the that you could take the case out that it's magnetically attached
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:55.520]   Oh, yeah, because then for the shows at least I could I don't have to have the wallet with the magnet
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:57.760]   It just makes the magnet doesn't interfere with
[00:34:57.760 --> 00:35:02.960]   Wireless charging if you use wireless. Yes. Well, and I read the reviews of course and they say they don't but so I you're right
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:05.040]   I'll be very interested to see
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:09.280]   Uh, this one is this from Davis people buying them antique leather
[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:14.160]   It's kind of it's very beat up which is kind of nice. It doesn't look like a fancy iPhone 10 in here
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:16.560]   It looks like somebody's dad's wallet
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:22.080]   But uh, and it has a the wrist strap doubles as a rubber band to close it up
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:27.520]   And I you know for 40 bucks. This actually is pretty good. Although I'm going to try some other ones just to see
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:34.000]   The only important thing is you never want the cars to be on the back because then the inductive charging will go through them and might erase the magnet
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:38.960]   That's right. You always want the cars to be on this works fine with wireless charging. Yep. That's interesting
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:40.000]   So
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.400]   I mean I've used wireless charging since it first was available on many and right in phones
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:50.800]   Uh, I that's another thing. I don't want to live without is wireless charging. I just uh, this is a in every way
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:56.240]   This phone kind of sets you up now. Do you saw the samson commercials? So I suppose we should show that
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:36:00.000]   This uh sam song felt like this is an opportunity
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.440]   To to gain some ground. I think this could backfire on them because as it turns out
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:12.400]   Uh, this phone is too freaking good and and when it's very similar to their sheeple commercials from a few years ago
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:16.160]   Yeah, but this this ends up selling the phone to me, but go ahead watch
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:19.440]   This is they're lined up in 2007 for the original iPhone
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:21.840]   I guess i just got
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:23.840]   Now 2010
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:27.280]   Should have been a nice phone for continuity editing this
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:28.480]   Yeah
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:30.480]   Hello again
[00:36:30.480 --> 00:36:34.320]   Oh wait a minute. She's got a samson phone. She's got a stylist. Wait a minute
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:40.160]   When he's sitting above this station, they both fall in the lake
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:43.200]   His phone no longer works. Her samson
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:46.400]   iPhone actually was water resistant. I'm just gonna keep continuity out of me
[00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:53.680]   Well, if there's hey, it's water resistant versus it has certification the dongle again. I agree. Not a great thing
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:57.280]   Wireless charging no dongle on the samson
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:02.160]   He put his in the drawer now. He's purchased a samson device
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:05.520]   And it writes guess what I just got
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.080]   Oh, by the way
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:12.960]   Was that because he's walking by the line for the new phone
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:16.400]   And there's a guy with a notch in his hair
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:23.600]   But you know who got that notch cut as well. Marcus Brownley
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:27.840]   You did he got a notch it looks better on him than this weirdo
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:32.320]   But that's a little dig also at apple
[00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:38.400]   You know what I have a note eight. I thought the note eight screen was gorgeous
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:42.720]   I wasn't crazy about the two to one. It was kind of tall
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:49.200]   This is this is and this fingerprint reader is paying in the butt where it is. This is an improvement in every respect
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:53.200]   I haven't had it my iPhone has not been my daily driver for four years
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:38:00.240]   I've been using pixels and the like this is this is easily the best phone out there right now easily
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:02.560]   It's the only negative is the cost
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:07.760]   Any other negatives you can think of I mean I face ID works fine. The new gestures are very intuitive
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:10.720]   I mean there are so there are like the face ID system still for some people
[00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:13.840]   Especially people in families where they want to have multiple people registered or businesses
[00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:15.760]   People registered
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:19.120]   But you can just give the other person the code the six digit code
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:20.400]   Yeah, yeah, totally
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:21.200]   But I mean like you
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:25.600]   The previously you could have a code and not have to give it to them if you wanted them to have quick biometric access
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:26.720]   Yeah, I do that with Lisa
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:30.080]   She had a I gave her a fingerprint on my iPhone. Yeah, my old iPhone
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:34.320]   I don't think it's a big deal to say well what I did is I made the code be something she knows
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:40.800]   Yeah, uh, you do want the code to be something easy and fast for you to remember an enter because you will be doing a lot at least initially
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:43.200]   Because face ID doesn't work in every environment
[00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:46.480]   But what's really interesting is when it doesn't work
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:50.880]   And you give it the code it has now then learned that environment, right?
[00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:53.360]   So it is there is no question in my mind
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:58.800]   Doing what apple said it would do which is getting better and better and better at recognizing me. It's really impressive
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:02.080]   The craziest thing to me. I think I mentioned this before is when they talk about it
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:05.440]   They don't talk about coding machines. They talk about training something almost like a pet
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:09.360]   And it's got like a little batman neural engine that just stops spouffers
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:11.040]   And it's got like a joker neural engine
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:13.120]   It tries to think of new and creative ways to spoof it
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:17.360]   And I'm not sure they know what these engines are doing anymore. They kind of just build them and they're like go
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:20.000]   It's a I
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.560]   Uh, I use it as you use it on one pass last pass also works with it
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:29.440]   uh banking apps and actually maybe I want last pass to work with face ID
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:35.760]   Because if it doesn't do that then I have to type in and I have a very long last best password as same one would hope
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:39.600]   Uh, so when it doesn't I actually gave up. I just said all I won't use last pass then
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:40.960]   I'll wait till it works
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:45.760]   And you just but you keep training it now works when I wake up and bed my eyes are half shut
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:50.080]   It works in the dark perfectly little darkness total darkness because it's infrared
[00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:54.240]   I use it a concert uh went to bernaud's mars concert on friday night
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:56.480]   That's weird concert lighting and lasers and stuff
[00:39:56.480 --> 00:40:03.120]   Flawless it handles most invoices you would have to beam light like either the sun or a laser directly into the camera to blind it for
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:06.320]   Not to work sunglasses will foil it if it can't see your eyes
[00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:12.080]   If they're infrared so sunglasses by themselves won't foil it like mine don't but if you have inter an infrared filter on it
[00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:14.080]   It will stop the okay. That's interesting
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:18.880]   Uh, but glasses don't although the first time I worked I trained it without glasses first time I wore it
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:20.880]   It was a little confused, but then it learned
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:25.760]   One issue some people have is they put reading glasses across their eyes and then it can't see their attention
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:32.560]   So yeah, so I turned on I just turned off attention and I have to say I think I'm gonna leave it off because now it's just like it always knows
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:35.280]   It's like I'm curious as to whether we'll see this, you know
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:40.320]   Run into the mac line and and into the ipad line where you know biometric becomes the only you know
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:44.720]   It becomes something that's available on every apple product because I think that once you get used to it
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:51.520]   Whether it's apple pay with the thumb or the facial every time you time you I type a code in now or give someone my credit card
[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:53.760]   I think this is a really huge security hole
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:59.120]   Like you get used to like I really this all should be biometric and we shouldn't be having you know, I shouldn't
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:04.560]   Be giving anybody any any of that information and I think that especially as hacking continues
[00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:08.000]   I think there's gonna be more interest in tightening all of those things down
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.160]   Somebody the chat was pointing out if you're the type of person who tapes over the camera
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:14.880]   You can't do that anymore
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:18.720]   Um, that's I've seen it. I've seen people still do it on their phone
[00:41:18.720 --> 00:41:24.800]   But then you but if you're that kind of person you don't want to use biometrics. Anyway, you want to type in your passcode. Yeah
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:28.640]   Well, yeah, I mean passcode is not
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:30.000]   uh
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.200]   Biometrics are not so
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:35.440]   identity and convenience and a long strong password if you're like if you're in the nsa
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:38.960]   You want a pseudo random password to put in can you do that?
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:44.480]   Can I replace my six digit passcode? Yes. Yeah with a past where I have a long password. All right
[00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:50.640]   Last year I stopped using numeric passcodes and started using alphanumeric's that are really really long
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:55.120]   Which which but I will admit that I changed the like three word
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:42:02.560]   Password on my iphone 10 with something that was six letters long at least for the first weekend because I was typing in so much
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:07.600]   It's like, okay. I I'm willing to get hacked by people who can guess
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:13.440]   Two guess two like the three letter words. Let me take a little break. We're getting behind and I don't want to get too far behind in the show
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:15.840]   uh, but there's lots more to talk about including
[00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:20.080]   uh, well no longer do we use the double irish with a
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:23.520]   Dutch sandwich
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:27.120]   We have an hour. We have a new way of doing it. It's the I'm calling it the jersey fudge
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:31.360]   And we'll and we'll talk about we'll talk about that the
[00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:36.240]   And just a little bit we actually have a guy in our chat room who comes from jersey
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:40.560]   uh, the island of jersey just off the uh, uh, uh,
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:46.320]   one spell key urns. Yeah, gurns like gurns jersey and um, yeah channel
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:47.840]   It's the channel islands, right?
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:51.840]   And uh, he always when he visits his visits a couple times brings me fudge from jersey
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:54.240]   Apparently they have really good cows
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:43:00.320]   And the fudge is fantastic. And so and that's his chat handle jersey fudge. So now that's what i'm calling it
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:05.600]   Uh apparently apple has stored 280 billion dollars in his little timey island
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:08.560]   We'll talk about that in a second first though
[00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:12.320]   I want to tell you about the best thing for your new iphone 10 or your ipad
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:17.200]   Or heaven for fender android tablet or device. It's texture
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:18.880]   It is

[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:53.680]   Uh, and I subscribed to the new yorker, but but now with texture. I don't have to i've got it
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:44:00.320]   Oh every month there's something in rolling stone and vanity fair and the atlantic that I want to read they're all on texture
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:08.400]   In fact, the best magazines are all on texture including trade magazines that I would not subscribe to because they're very very expensive
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:14.240]   But I want to read billboard and ad age and ad week. I love those things because that's my trade

[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:17.760]   Tech I talked to the founder the other day
[00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:22.960]   And I said are you noticing an uptick in people reading political stories? They said oh, yeah
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:25.440]   He said that's become the number one category
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:29.040]   Tech is very big too. They've got all the great tech magazines including Wired

[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:07.440]   So this is part of the paradise papers that came out this weekend
[00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:13.600]   This was a kind of a follow-up to a previous massive leak of financial of information
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:19.040]   of of financial records and primarily coming from
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:22.160]   a company called applebee, which is a law firm
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:25.760]   uh in the canary islands, which helps big
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:28.960]   companies and high wealth individuals
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:30.880]   use
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:33.760]   And I will point this out right up front completely legally
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:37.200]   use um
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:42.880]   Tax havens to stash their money and of course apple very famously started a subsidiary in ireland
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:45.520]   Where the corporate tax used to be very very low
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:47.920]   transferred a bunch of
[00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:50.320]   IP of intellectual property assets there
[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:54.160]   Took a lot of the money they made and transferred and you know paid
[00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:59.680]   The irish subsidiary for use of that property and was able to offshore billions of dollars
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:05.520]   Well, remember the EU censured ireland and asked them for hundreds of millions of dollars
[00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:08.880]   Because it was being used billions from apple billions
[00:47:08.880 --> 00:47:11.760]   Be not from apple though ironically from ireland
[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:15.760]   So I told ireland eu told ireland you get it from apple more
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:23.040]   Yeah, and and ireland did change its rules, but the island of jersey apparently has a corporate tax rate of zero
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:26.640]   And so according to the paradise papers apple
[00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:32.320]   Google as well apple's the biggest but many other companies and the queen of england
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:39.120]   And the finance advisor to joustin trudot and a great many high-worth individuals including our commerce secretary
[00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:41.600]   Wilbur ross have been using these
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:44.080]   again legal
[00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:50.880]   Tax dodges to stash money. I think apple has 282 billion in jersey, but apple denies it
[00:47:50.880 --> 00:47:54.080]   Right
[00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:58.400]   They put up a news post loss. I think it was late last night, right where they try to explain their side of the story
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:00.240]   So
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:02.080]   Nobody's ever said apple's doing something illegal
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:06.640]   And they're doing what you would expect what shareholders anyway would expect which is
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:10.400]   I think they're paying as little taxes. They can legally and I think all of us do that
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:14.960]   Like I have an accountant, but you can't do the double Dutch with the
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:17.840]   I don't have enough money. I don't have enough money
[00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:21.600]   You know what would happen if I had enough money? I would use it well, you know like
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:26.480]   So I you can't blame apple for doing this, but you can blame politicians by the way
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:31.520]   Here's a map from wikipedia where you see the red countries these countries have politicians who are
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:34.560]   Exposed in the paradise papers who are using these
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:39.040]   Tax dodges now you know why it's legal in so many countries
[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:43.520]   Because and in fact a new tax law that's being proposed at congress right now
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:48.560]   Makes these loopholes one would hope would make them illegal makes them more makes gives you more loopholes
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:54.560]   More ways to do this the only argument I've seen really against this is the moral one where it says that you know apple is
[00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:59.680]   Apple takes a moral stance on many many issues including accessibility and civil rights and civil liberties
[00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:04.800]   And they should have a moral obligation to pay as much tax as they possibly can
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:12.400]   Sorry, I just observed you know it's absurd and even Tim Cook has said that the laws need to be reformed
[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:15.200]   um nevertheless
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:22.720]   I mean, it's an incredible who does it Nike does it Walmart does it allians does it seaman's doesn't mcdonald's does it yahoo does it
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:25.760]   Allergan the makers of botox do it
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:32.640]   Um, you know billions of dollars and now what's happened though is that puts a tax burden on you and me
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:34.640]   We're not rich enough to do this
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:40.560]   So we pay more tax I pay more to it pays more taxes than apple does by far. No, you don't
[00:49:40.560 --> 00:49:44.960]   I mean, you know they are seven percent of our ireland's economy
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:49.760]   I mean, I like it's that's apples justification and they'd say well we pay more taxes than anybody in the world
[00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:52.720]   I believe they make more money than anybody in the world
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:55.680]   I also think america is unique in that they want you to pay taxes for money
[00:49:55.680 --> 00:50:00.480]   You are so we're an outside america whether you're an individual or a company and it's not all countries understand that yet
[00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:07.360]   apple is transferring intellectual property assets out of the united states to ireland and now to jersey to
[00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:10.560]   To reduce their tax liability. I agree
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:16.960]   As you got to pay more even though you don't have to and and and amazon's looking at moving into a new city
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:20.000]   This happens in the united states too. By the way, it's not you know like cities give
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.240]   cities states
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:25.760]   Provide companies with tax breaks. I mean you want to talk about the film industry
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:30.640]   You know you get a 25 percent tax break to film in louisiana or in new mexico or
[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:33.760]   You know and that's money that it's not it's like a tax credit that comes back to you
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:38.160]   I mean, it's it's an incredible. I mean so it the competition over taxes
[00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:45.280]   Is basically how countries and states and cities market themselves to corporations to that point ireland
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:51.200]   In one year, it's gross domestic product went up 26 when apple transferred everything over there
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:56.320]   So yes, uh, but now jersey gets nothing because they're not charging any tax
[00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:59.840]   Jersey just gets uh some bankers rich, I guess
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:02.000]   Um
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   They get the name of the press leo
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:07.600]   So i'll do about them before that now everybody knows about yeah apple's being sued for 14 and a half
[00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:13.600]   Billion dollars in packs taxes, but but I have to say by the bono also does this
[00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:17.840]   The president of librarian does it essentially that everybody
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:23.120]   Everybody who wants to have some control over how they spend their money whether it's bono wanting to give more money away
[00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:27.760]   Right, they don't want to give it to the government. They don't want to I mean they don't want to uh, they don't they want to
[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:33.760]   Give it to what they think is important queen of england does it and not have it, you know be you know squandered
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:38.720]   buying john katyan whatever they did your former prime minister did it does it
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:45.360]   So shuan against strangler what we need to do frankly is we need to call congress and say, you know, you got to eliminate these loopholes
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:52.080]   It's hard because i think i think we need to get real listen to you know why it's not gonna happen because these people pay congress a lot of money to make sure
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:56.160]   That they don't pay as much tax as the congress. It's the parliaments and other countries
[00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:58.560]   They're all the benefit from this like materially
[00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:04.560]   So it's very hard to get them to move off a dozen members of the trump cabinet are in the documents
[00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:09.680]   Robert mercer and sheldon atlson are in the doc basically any high value individual
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:15.440]   Is a fool if they're paying taxes at this point you pay people just to make that go away and the most i'm probably half of them
[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:17.360]   Don't even know it's happening like they just you know
[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:21.200]   They have an accounting firm that you know they have a hundred million dollars and they hand it off to a manager and the manager
[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:23.040]   Make sure that they pay the minimum amount of taxes
[00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:26.240]   They can do it does it paul allen does it wesley clark does it
[00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:32.480]   It's pretty much i'm feeling like an idiot for paying all these taxes i pay almost half my income in taxes
[00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:34.960]   So do i
[00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:38.480]   I feel like an idiot but but again if i if i somehow if i somehow
[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:43.600]   Sold my company for a hundred million dollars i would hand it off to a managing firm and they would do exactly the same thing
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:46.400]   And i wouldn't know about it or think about it or it wouldn't bother me
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:50.640]   You know it would just go you know i would hand it to them and then they give me a proper return
[00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:58.560]   And that's how that that stuff happens according to the bust and consulting group the amount of money involved here is about 10 trillion dollars apples just a
[00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:02.000]   You know fraction of that i drop in that billion buckets
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   But i do feel like i don't know i don't know what to say it's offensive
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.800]   But it's not apples fault i understand there's so many
[00:53:08.800 --> 00:53:12.240]   I guess that there's so many places that that happens that it's like we
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:16.800]   That that wants an easy one to see but you look at like okay high frequency trading that is the leech
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:21.360]   That sits on top of of wall street just sucks money out for no value at all
[00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:26.000]   I mean, you know and and we know you know people just don't understand it well enough to bar argue about it
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:29.520]   So we can see this one, but i don't think that it's you know i i you know it's
[00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:36.800]   A small number. Yeah, i'm i'm really much more offended by what a lot of large corporations the tech service the tech industry
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:42.800]   The games they play with labor to make sure that they will never convert an hourly
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:47.360]   Hourly temporary worker into a permanent worker who gets benefits this
[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:50.400]   I love amazon. I love them for a great many reasons
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:52.720]   I think they're doing a lot of really great work in tech
[00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:57.280]   But I hate the fact that they really they seem to stack the deck so that
[00:53:57.280 --> 00:54:02.880]   Yeah, we'll make sure that someone gets fired before they get to the next level of employment
[00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:10.000]   Where again, they're going to have to start being paying them for actually listening to my real employees where they're obligated to get them insurance
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   They're really obligated to give them some protection
[00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:14.240]   On the job
[00:54:14.240 --> 00:54:19.200]   I and that's it's not just amazon. There are a lot of companies that are like this that it's not just corporations my my
[00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:23.520]   You know government government agencies do the same thing where they put people on unemployment and take them
[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:26.960]   You know they put them on and take them off just to keep their their budget controlled
[00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:30.800]   And and you know it is uh, you know everybody's trying everybody finds an angle
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:36.480]   You know my my mother my mother was my mother decided to work for head start for a little while because she was really excited about it
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:40.720]   And then when she's watched what they were doing with with the employment she started asking questions and then she was fired
[00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:45.200]   Yeah, you know, it's like she was like, I don't think this is right and then they were like again
[00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:51.840]   It's it's it's okay for it's okay for apple to say that yeah, we have a business in the ganery islands
[00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:57.360]   It's uh, it's a food service company that apple runs that we that makes 128 billion dollars a year
[00:54:57.360 --> 00:54:59.680]   That's why we need to keep moving that money around there
[00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:02.080]   What I don't like is making sure that hey, you know what?
[00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:05.920]   All these employees we've had in this company that we bought we bought last year
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:10.640]   300 employees if we make if we fire them all then rehire them all as consultants
[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:16.160]   Like no, don't fire them all and rehire them as consultants. They're not you're not hiding money here
[00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:22.080]   These are real lives. So that's that's what I wish that that were headline news every single week as opposed to this company's hiding
[00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:28.960]   Uh tax money someplace. Yeah, I I agree with that to add insult to in jr. jersey fuzz says he can't even buy an iphone ten in jersey
[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:32.080]   What did the one they had?
[00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:37.040]   No, no that you can't buy apple you can't buy one in jersey. There's no apple store
[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:41.520]   So he had he said he had a mess with his postal codes to pretend he was in the uk
[00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:45.760]   But wasn't that one of the 55 launch countries and I thought we joked that they would have like one iphone
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:48.480]   Yeah, I don't know at a convenience store or something
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:54.400]   But but still I mean the the community is benefiting. It's just like the sod houses of oklahoma
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:58.640]   When they're settling it would build houses out of sod because that was the most available material
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:03.600]   They're building houses out of bricks of a hundred dollar bills produced by america. Yeah
[00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:05.840]   By the way, schools new hospitals
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:08.480]   Value when you build your buildings out of money
[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:11.840]   The intersection. Oh, yeah. Yeah good for eating and schooling
[00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:15.360]   The key is to crumple it up into little balls because it creates more of an air
[00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:21.360]   Yeah, that's that's why the coins are not and I think that hundred hundred dollar bills actually insulate better than a dollar
[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:26.080]   Yeah, well the best is those bundles, you know, there's ten thousand dollars. It's a cryptocurrency of the best insulator
[00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:29.120]   Thank you jersey fudge. I said canary islands, which is a very nice place
[00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:35.920]   I've never been to came in islands. Not the came in. It's got to holiday in the canary islands. Yeah canaries are nice
[00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:38.640]   Uh, it's it's catering. Isn't it?
[00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:41.520]   It's pronounced canary
[00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:44.160]   Yeah in singapore. You can't read because I
[00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:53.040]   I remember because it was also it's also noticeable for being the site of the worst of passenger air disaster in
[00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:55.840]   And I and I and I remember
[00:56:55.840 --> 00:56:58.800]   at the time as a little kid
[00:56:59.360 --> 00:57:03.760]   News readers or whatever correcting themselves and saying canary islands until oh no canary canary
[00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:07.920]   It's it's named after the bird not after not after the dogs. Oh, well. I'll be there in next year
[00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:10.000]   So I'll I'll be sure to ask a local
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:15.360]   Uh, you know, I I should I should get credit not for not for correcting you
[00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:20.800]   But but for correcting you and not starting it with actually actually Leo
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:26.080]   I'll take if you were just to pay attention. You know, you're right. I'm looking at the uh
[00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:29.680]   the article on wikipedia canary
[00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:32.240]   And fast on a pebble canary
[00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:36.080]   Kind of there's a different one. I will explain to you
[00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:43.600]   It's an archipelago an autonomous community of spain located in the atlantic ocean 100 miles miles west in aracha piligo leo
[00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:45.840]   Oh shut up
[00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:49.280]   I'll check my schedule and get back to you
[00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:52.880]   Hedge you often we get back to me often often
[00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:58.720]   So, uh, why don't we get me deduce about the future of uh, iphone from the ten is this is this now the
[00:57:58.720 --> 00:58:04.400]   It feels to me like they don't want to go back the next design language. Yeah, yeah, definitely
[00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:08.720]   They don't have a they don't have a habit of having of doing a fork of hardware features
[00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:10.640]   Especially something as important as how do you unlock the phone?
[00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:14.160]   So I think it's I think it's clear that they're gonna want to put face-head in everything
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:16.800]   I think it's clear. They're gonna they're gonna want to put olet on everything
[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:21.520]   I don't know how they're gonna do both of them and still have items like the iphone se
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:26.400]   But they they also again, they don't want to have one one laptop that has
[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:27.760]   uh
[00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:30.880]   One technology, you know, the little laptop that doesn't have they like to have a little bit of consistency
[00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:38.720]   Congratulations, uh apple the supreme court has refused to hear the slide to unlock patent case
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:41.200]   So it's over
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:46.560]   It's over uh apple now owns slide to unlock and uh sam's just gonna have this one. They brought it back
[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:51.600]   Yeah, it just brought it back. Yeah, that's right. It is it's on this. That's right
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:56.240]   Somebody tweeted. Oh, yeah, great now apple owns it, but they don't use it but they do now in the iphone 10
[00:58:56.240 --> 00:59:02.960]   So there but seriously all every time there's like a new chapter in this lawsuit and all lawsuits like it
[00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:10.720]   It's like when you read about how a homeowner and the homeowner association are suing over the definition of is a mailbox considered a structure
[00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:15.680]   And dude, I did that person need to have a permit to put up a ticker shaped mailbox
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:24.400]   It's like I don't you are your idiots both of you are idiots for arguing about this for more than it takes to cook one hamburger at a community cookout
[00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:31.920]   I go away. I do have to feed a hungry person. Please. I do have to say apple had a very good quarter
[00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:35.200]   There are quarterly results came out uh between last show and this
[00:59:35.200 --> 00:59:37.920]   And uh iphone net sales
[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:45.040]   55 of the overall revenue which actually would have been bigger except for look at the size of the services chunk
[00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:50.640]   That's the mustard iphone is read on this mustad the mustard color is 16% services
[00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:54.960]   Huge growth and a very large chunk of revenue
[00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:58.320]   Followed by and i'm happy to say max sales
[00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:05.680]   iPad sales and other which I guess is what the watch. I don't know what other I don't know what other they keep the watch in others
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:07.440]   uh, but
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:13.120]   Apples here that's here that naysayers the mac is kicking others ass. It is all the others
[01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:18.240]   Mac sales up ipad sales up they've been going down for a while
[01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:23.680]   Uh, and I mean this was a spectacular quarter as we expected
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:26.560]   But there are some things to be learned for instance the iphone 8 seems to have sold
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:28.800]   Quite well
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:30.800]   Wow different than those reports indicated
[01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:37.280]   Well, they didn't break out the iphone 8 specifically, but they said they sold 46.7 million iphones
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:39.520]   And it looked like the plus mix was high again
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:44.640]   Oh interesting they mentioned that in the analyst call you listen. I'm sure to the analyst call you
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:50.880]   You and serenity. I know serenity. Yes typing is faster. She was honeymooning this year. So mica mica sergeant at the typing
[01:00:50.880 --> 01:00:52.240]   How dare she
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:56.640]   Well, no her honeymoon is going to the world roller derby championships and sept meeting for like three days straight
[01:00:56.640 --> 01:01:05.360]   A comedy a combination competing in a world cup event and shooting shooting same event as part of an iphone 10. Yeah, yes
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:09.200]   Got damn these people who are younger than me and more
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:12.480]   And have more energy and more ambition
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:15.200]   So they had a great
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:17.520]   Q3
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:21.440]   Yeah, i'm sorry q4. This is their there's this is their calendar fourth quarter
[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:25.280]   Um, or fiscal fourth quarter. I should say it's the calendar third quarter
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:30.320]   This means with the iphone 10 coming out obviously demand very high for it
[01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:33.600]   They're going to have two record quarters in a war and the holidays. I mean
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:35.360]   Holy cow
[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:40.800]   With and not don't forget that they have the they have the home pod coming out which is going to was priced for
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:42.080]   uh
[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:47.200]   People who are not who it's priced low enough that people will buy it even if they're not sure about it
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:50.560]   And it's something that everybody can want and and try out
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:52.720]   So that's could be pretty exciting
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:57.200]   If they if they if they managed to ship it before december 24th, let's say
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:02.000]   Yeah, Alex buys all the iMac pros that we expect he will it could be a blowout quarter
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.680]   No, I don't know
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:08.320]   And apple which is which normally gives fairly conservative guidance said their their q1
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:12.640]   2018 is going to be the best single quarter ever by a wide market
[01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:14.720]   Yeah, so
[01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:19.200]   Stand back and get ready. Jersy. Well, you can see what's some packets of money coming
[01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:24.480]   What's interesting is is that if you go back and you look at what Tim that Tim Cook said what a year you're an afago
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:26.320]   He said we're
[01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:31.040]   Very excited about what's coming up. You know like it was like one of those things like you and we're all like what does he mean?
[01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:33.040]   What is he talking about what turns out? This is
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:36.800]   I want to see at what point does the spreadsheet tell them that look apple?
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:41.520]   It's costing us a lot more money to store the money that we're making than the money itself
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:45.920]   It's like the cost of manufacturing a penny is like seven cents. It's like, please let's
[01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:52.320]   It's important. We not making more money. Tim cook and luka mestry the cfo
[01:02:52.320 --> 01:02:55.200]   Taking the analyst call said they instantly the iphone
[01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:59.680]   Instantly became our two most popular iphone models and have been every week since then of course
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:03.200]   They took the call before the 10 came out right because now I guarantee you that's
[01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:05.200]   10 is the most popular
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:11.920]   They don't yeah, I'm supply they don't break it down. But if you look at iphone revenue, this is a four quarter moving average
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:17.600]   Uh, it's solid. It's solid and strong. It's not as big as when the iphone six. That was the big jump, right?
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:22.720]   Right because I love it when Jason Snell gets his graph on he is really just doing it
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:24.720]   This is this is from six colors.com
[01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:27.360]   Those are billions of dollars kids
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:33.040]   Yeah, iphone six famously sucked upgrades forward people who were playing upgrade later saw the bigger phone and they decided screw it
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:36.880]   I'm gonna go now and I think iphone 10 because the supply is so constrained
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:40.000]   But I think people are still looking at iphone 10 and going I was gonna upgrade next year
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:45.120]   But look at that edge-to-edge display or look at those animoji or whatever it is and it makes them upgrade earlier than they would have otherwise
[01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:47.280]   Now let's put this in perspective
[01:03:47.280 --> 01:03:51.760]   46.7 million iphone sold in this just ended quarter. That's a lot
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:56.320]   Uh, the top quarter they've ever had was the last
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:04:02.480]   holiday quarter from 20 in 2017 and that was 78 million phones and apple's guidance is
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:05.600]   This is gonna be the best ever 81 or 82. I think
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:08.560]   81 or 82 billion dollars
[01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:14.240]   To put it in common Neil cyber and and uh ben baharan at a great conversation on launch day
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:18.800]   Where they said apple just sold more iphone 10s then google is likely to sell pixel phones the entire year
[01:04:18.800 --> 01:04:19.440]   Oh
[01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:24.080]   In one day. So it's the scale they operate at even when they're constrained the amount of units
[01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:26.640]   They're pushing it's ridiculous. This is unit sales, Alex
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:29.360]   So remember that this is a more expensive phone
[01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:32.640]   So rev you know revenue and profits will be even higher
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:38.880]   Although we don't know because apple has sometimes taken a hit on margin with like things on the ipad pro when they first bring them to market
[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:42.000]   Because they know they'll make it up in generation two or one later production
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:47.120]   Units and the panel in this thing is super expensive and the two-depth camera and this is super expensive
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:49.760]   So they'll be just gonna see where the margin actually works out
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:55.440]   Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't be surprised at all for apple to say well, we're you know, i'm not gonna lose money on the apple
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:57.920]   No, no, but they might make like
[01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:00.160]   3rd 29 is that a 33 or something?
[01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:00.640]   percent
[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:06.640]   Yeah, but uh, I could see them doing that because it the price is high as it is they would like to keep that price
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:13.760]   At least within the ballpark. I think we need to lay bets on when we think apple crosses just even for an hour crosses
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:19.440]   evaluation of a trillion dollars. Yeah, oh this because they're at 900. They're at 900 billion
[01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:26.000]   That cord will do it. Do you think do you think that there might come ever come a day where they're so valuable that
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:30.960]   Either for regulatory purposes for shareholder purposes for tax purposes
[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:34.960]   They really have to do an alphabet sort of thing where they have to create a new
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:37.600]   independent company
[01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.880]   Just for iTunes or a new independent company just for mobile
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:46.560]   It seems it's it kind of staggers the mind to think of one company that's that has that much
[01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:54.160]   Valuation to it that is still here are the here are the half dozen white people on this one one page that friend the entire thing
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:56.720]   I don't know. I
[01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:58.880]   Do you think that the best thing the best thing?
[01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:02.960]   I mean they won't say this I think but I think one of the best things that were happened to him was android because
[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:05.360]   They'd have all kinds of regulatory problems. Yeah
[01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:09.520]   Exists, you know and so the fact that even though they're making a lot of money with the iphone
[01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:14.240]   The fact that it is the minority of the market leaves them to be able to do pretty much whatever they want
[01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:16.240]   You know and I think that's an interesting interesting
[01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:19.040]   Not only that but they they benefit from competition in the traditional way
[01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:21.200]   They also benefit from competition because
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:27.280]   Imagine a world in which the in which mac OS was the dominant operating system
[01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:30.800]   Let's say they had micro Microsoft Windows market share worldwide
[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:36.800]   They could not have a business model that involves the the lowest price laptop is a thousand dollars
[01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:42.960]   And it doesn't have the features that everybody wants and needs they would have to start find a way to make a 500
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:49.200]   All laptop that has more conventional boring features about it. They couldn't really afford to do
[01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:54.800]   Three models all of them have this high high high high grade of components and stuff like that
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:58.480]   So it really does give them the given that there's there's the there's the
[01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:01.360]   There's the two brothers one brother
[01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:05.920]   Never moved out of his hometown took care of the matri of the mom and dad were taken care of
[01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:09.120]   You know ran for mayor in the community the the george bailey
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:11.760]   Bedford falls that's microsoft
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:12.960]   and the
[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:19.200]   And apple that got to be the brother the younger brother who got to go to world war two and become a rational metal vauder
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:21.680]   winner and be a have those adventures
[01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:24.240]   I would say that's a sad thing for microsoft
[01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:32.400]   But it does it does help to illustrate that we need lots of companies pursuing that that gets excited by by completely different things in order to have
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:37.120]   A complete palette of technology out there. I should point out according to
[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:42.480]   analysis and I know these bill of materials analysis are always a little
[01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:48.400]   Apple can test the matec insights does it every every phone and they say
[01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:55.440]   Coronatec insights the iphone 10 cost apple or 25 more to make than the iphone 8 because it costs 43
[01:07:55.440 --> 01:08:02.880]   More they actually make more money on the iphone 10. I think that the problem they say that cost is 357 dollars and 50 cents
[01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:05.760]   I think the problem with that
[01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:11.520]   Calculation is always that it it calculates on the parts that are there not the return rate
[01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:15.440]   You know, I think that there was yeah, I remember talking to someone about the
[01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:17.920]   The
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:23.280]   There's other costs, you know like the trackpad on when the first when the trackpad first came out that didn't have the button
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:26.160]   I heard that the return rate was like 60
[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:29.760]   So while it but not but not has a certain value to it
[01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:32.640]   But they were throwing away 60 of them because they weren't getting through it right
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:39.840]   Olet Olet is this particular problem the number especially again a brand new manufacturing the number of panels
[01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:42.880]   They have to throw away because of dead pixels or because it didn't come out right
[01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:46.400]   It's not as so they've got it knocked down so that it always works always works
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:49.920]   It doesn't it doesn't get into how much it costs to manufacture
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:51.440]   I'm sorry
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:55.280]   How much cost to assemble these things is so you you take that with a grain of salt
[01:08:55.280 --> 01:09:01.120]   I tend to read them kind of like the way that douglas adam's in the in the hijackers guy to the galaxy
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:07.680]   Describe the hitchhiker's gal guy to the galaxy itself. It said it even when it's wrong at least it's considered to be
[01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:12.320]   And it's it's canonically and and officially wrong
[01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:14.560]   So so it's so even if these numbers are wrong
[01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:18.320]   It's they're always wrong in the same way every single time
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:24.560]   So they're at least a good jumping off point for conversation, but 65 dollars and 50 cents for the olet display
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:28.080]   But remember Samsung makes it so that that number would include the reject
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:33.680]   Right. This is what samsa charges them. Oh, there's so mean well that we've seen much higher rates too like $120
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:37.120]   But there are a couple important things here one is my favorite west wing reference where it says
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:41.200]   Yeah, the the second one costs three dollars the first one cost to a billion
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:42.080]   Right
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:43.120]   Good to get to there
[01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:48.400]   But also a lot of times the components we've seen mistakes with components like when they just assumed that there was an FM radio on the
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:53.920]   iPhone because a broadcom number looked the same and apple actually sources custom parts for all of these and the value
[01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:58.240]   The cost and value of a custom part is much different than just applying off the shelf retail part
[01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:04.320]   So my understanding is that these estimates they are they are consistent unto themselves, but they have no bearing on reality
[01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:08.160]   Well, it's they have to be considered for what they are
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:13.360]   I mean, it's not explosive here's what it's they are they are doing the researchers are doing hard work
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:14.240]   They're doing important work
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:17.200]   I've spoken to a couple of people whose job it is to do stuff like that
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:21.440]   And they don't just simply you know google for google go on ebay.com
[01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:23.760]   So how much is it caused to buy a panel or anything like that?
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:28.480]   It is an incredible amount of work the the same amount of work that a lot of people put into that's like a
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:32.240]   A lot of people put into predicting who's going to win the Oscars or who's going to
[01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:36.560]   Which picture which picture is going to be at the top of the crown at the end of the season
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:39.280]   There's a lot of math a lot of research a lot of work. There's a lot of
[01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:44.640]   Scholarship that goes into it, but at the end of the day, it's just their guess as to what's going to happen
[01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:47.040]   That's a good way to put it
[01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:48.400]   so um
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:50.800]   stainless steel chassis 36 dollars
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:54.400]   I mean there I you know as
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:11:00.080]   I guess the point is these are the same same people who generated the numbers for the eight so yes, okay
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:05.760]   But as you point out uh rene, they're if you're comparing apples to apples
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:12.000]   You know they're doing the same methodology for both phones. It's still more expensive, but better margin, right?
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:18.160]   In the margin I would be less careful about because again, we I don't know how that might be an average over time with that margin becomes
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:22.240]   But certainly up front. I don't think they're making those I mean that it could be it could be that margin
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:27.120]   You know september of next year or or alive next year, but I think that is probably less than this first batch
[01:11:28.720 --> 01:11:32.400]   And these things always get less expensive to manufacturers time goes by
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:37.440]   Uh because the reject rate of manufacture becomes less they also figure out where the ball next are so
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:43.360]   By the by the time they're charging 500 dollars for oh my god
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:51.120]   I you have an iphone x not an iphone x vi. Oh my god. What will they call the next one? Who are you x? I know
[01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:56.640]   I can call anything. I've access iphone bandana. I think the iphone excess is pretty good
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:58.640]   Yes
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:01.920]   Well, they were joking this long. I'd be the iphone s e x
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:09.280]   I wouldn't even be I wouldn't be so sure that there isn't an iphone 10 addition
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:14.480]   Somewhere on the idea that I hope to god there isn't because that'll just cost me a lot
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:20.000]   Yeah, what's actually is when we see the numbers ceramic when we actually see the numbers
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:26.320]   Um because what they're proving with the 10 of course is that there is a definitely a part of their market that is not
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:33.920]   Cost sensitive at all and and they you know there's a I think that there's a possibility that you see this this one become less expensive
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:37.680]   Another one comes out that is let's say 1200 now that they broke in the thousand
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:41.600]   The and this is why the margin thing is important. They clearly did the math
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:45.040]   Well, how much more can we charge right and they said 200 bucks?
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:49.360]   Nobody that's that's gonna be if you charge 500 bucks more uh
[01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:52.560]   Uh, but we could probably push it as far as 200
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:56.240]   Again, it's it's how much are they paying for many people? It's how much are they paying per month?
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:59.840]   You know and I think that that's gonna be an interesting that's just not that's just a few bucks
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:02.800]   Or leo remember your iphone yours for your apple watch edition unboxing
[01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:07.120]   I could imagine where apple takes a small batch and does iphone addition and you get the
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:10.880]   the inductive charger in the box with it and you get all the sort of
[01:13:10.880 --> 01:13:14.800]   Pump and circumstance you get with the apple place to stainless steel with ceramic
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:19.040]   Yeah, I mean there's all sorts of things they could test that's what you do when your product reaches maturity
[01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:24.400]   You only start increasing by you you no longer add carriers or add territories to increase number of people
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:27.840]   You start adding stranger verticals like sizes or materials
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:32.160]   So much that at this point I would consider joining the upgrade program
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:35.360]   I didn't in the past because I wasn't sure I'd always but this one
[01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:37.760]   I definitely want the next one in the one after and the one after right?
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:40.400]   Go ahead, Andy. I'm sorry
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:43.200]   Just to just pointing out that uh remember that no the
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:47.520]   October, November the first the first month of sales of a new iphone particularly
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:49.920]   Remember that those are kind of freak sales
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:55.200]   And that those are the people that are they don't want to wait even a week to get the new phone
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:59.920]   They are they are on tender hooks. Those are the people that you're calling me a 200. Don't
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:03.600]   Excuse me. I miss
[01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:09.360]   Miss a phone that I paid for because I don't know if i'm going to get a review unit
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:13.280]   I can't stand to not at least be testing it out the first week long outside everybody else
[01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:18.400]   I let me let me tell you watching watching uh rene's like instagram stuff
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:22.400]   I felt like a little kid who was like how to stay inside doing his violin
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:25.600]   Lessons while all the kids are playing stick ball outside. It's like oh
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:28.720]   I'd like to play with an emojis too
[01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:32.880]   But it's so it's it becomes the that's an important piece of data
[01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:36.640]   The other important piece of data happens in the coming months when you have the person who
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:40.800]   Drop their phone off the side of a rented kayak and the people who
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:45.680]   Uh have finally had it with a three-year-old phone and they're going out to buy a new one
[01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:51.200]   When they make the choice between the iphone eight and the iphone ten, that's going to be really interesting data
[01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:54.800]   Uh, but I think I really like the direction that apple is taking
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:59.280]   It's uh, I know I've said this before but it's still very much on my mind that
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:05.680]   Uh, they really do want to be a design company that makes technology as opposed to a technology company
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:09.600]   That's the sort of thing you would say to sort of diminish apple five years ago
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:13.440]   But now I think it's really one of their most intriguing aspects
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:16.080]   They really want to make a beautiful object something that you just
[01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:21.840]   Love to pick up every morning and put down as the one the last things you see every single night
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:24.560]   and so that's why as much as I
[01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:29.600]   I I still find it difficult to say thousand dollars minimum iphone
[01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:33.760]   Without saying also really good android phones that cost four or five hundred dollars
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:38.640]   I'm at the same time. I'm intrigued by what apple would do if they said what if we were to
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:43.920]   Not increase the price of the iphone ten, but let's do an iphone ten edition
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:45.600]   Let's say we cost
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:51.520]   fifteen hundred dollars and we put no new technology in this but we really make this the most finally
[01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:55.600]   We'll make it like a like a the way that every single piece has fitted together
[01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:58.480]   We can do a ceramic uh a ceramic enclosure
[01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:03.760]   We can do a manufacturing technique that results in a shockingly beautiful object
[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:09.360]   But it fails every 37 out of 150 times we try to assemble one
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:12.080]   That would really get my attention very quickly
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:16.480]   And you know that i still think you play as a donor of a couple of like objects
[01:16:16.480 --> 01:16:18.480]   I know exactly what you're talking about
[01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:21.760]   There are very expensive android phones. We just don't see them very often there
[01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:22.240]   They're
[01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:22.720]   They're
[01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:28.080]   The essential phone which is titanium and ceramic and really is quite a beautiful object
[01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:31.440]   It's only 500 dollars. I mean there are there are beautiful phones out there
[01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:39.280]   But they're but they're you know, I just this works on so many ways. It's just again. They're tiffany car d'é
[01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:42.160]   All the shriveled cream crump and low
[01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:45.440]   All these you like to see there's a house style for
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:51.360]   $1,000 phone, but there's another house style for another thousand dollar phone just like they're there are Ferrari people
[01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:53.840]   They're a lamborghini people. They're a mclaren people
[01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:56.160]   They are these are each 15
[01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:58.160]   1.5 million dollar cars
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:01.440]   And they're each amazingly beautiful objects
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:06.640]   But there are some people that they would never they wouldn't spend 500,000 dollars on a lamborghini
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:09.760]   But they'll spend two million dollars on a mclaren or a conigzag
[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:13.360]   It's really it's it's a it's an interest
[01:17:13.360 --> 01:17:16.720]   I I would hate it if this were the direction of the entire industry
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:22.080]   But i'm intrigued by the idea of there being a component of the industry for people who again
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:26.960]   They had this relationship with their phone or they have enough money that they just want the most beautiful object
[01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:28.400]   We are getting to
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:31.360]   We as much as we've been talking about the nice features of the iPhone 10
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000]   it's hard for me to get around the
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.880]   observation that
[01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:40.880]   Every every phone that costs more than $300 is about 90
[01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:45.120]   Feature wise ease of use wise construction wise with each other
[01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:49.600]   And the rest of it is a lot of how much is that extra 5% or 10% worth to you
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:55.600]   So this is a great way the apple is uniquely poised to figure out a way to still make a relevant $800
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:57.440]   $900,000 phone
[01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:03.680]   Well, and I think that the other thing is is the features that we're seeing today for $1400 when everything the dust settles with your apple
[01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:05.760]   care and everything else
[01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:07.600]   is
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:12.160]   You know that's going to be in the $900 phone next year and in the $600 phone the
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:14.000]   After that or whatever
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:19.680]   Um, you know and in the fact that there's millions or tens of millions of people who want to buy something that's really expensive
[01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:23.120]   Um will help draw accelerate the the speed at which we
[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:29.360]   Move down that path, you know, I mean and really the the phone I spent far more time on my phone than I spent on my computer
[01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:32.240]   At this at this point. I mean it's it is the next computer
[01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:35.040]   Um, you know where I mean I don't think that
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:37.760]   I don't think it's a lot to disagree with that
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:42.000]   I just want to see uh andy do and emojie Hamilton right now
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:46.880]   See this but I have to I gotta say the idea
[01:18:46.880 --> 01:18:49.440]   I don't I don't want to pile on
[01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:53.920]   I'm just saying that there was a there was a time where the like the the Gundam style video
[01:18:53.920 --> 01:18:58.800]   I got everyone was talking about it was like this big thing and I searched I wonder what that is and I went to this is
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:01.760]   This is this is an insight into my personality for good or bad
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:06.240]   Then I went on youtube I wonder what that's about then I saw that I had 50 million views to it and I thought
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:09.040]   No, I want I'm not going to be smug about this
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:13.280]   But I would like to be the one person who has never seen the Gundam style video
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:18.400]   Barely has any idea what people are talking about if someone starts like doing a giddy up thing
[01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:21.440]   I don't know if that's the part of it if that is
[01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:23.680]   As soon as now
[01:19:23.680 --> 01:19:25.680]   Yeah, and so I so I
[01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:29.600]   I'm tempted I have thought about oh would be fun to do an animoji video
[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:35.280]   I'm like actually wouldn't it be kind of fun to not be the be the only person who has never done that and to look that on hip
[01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:38.240]   It's funny. Wait me. Harry. We're like I was a little confused
[01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:43.680]   We said Gundam style video because that of course is not the same thing as gangnam style video
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:49.600]   I was my mind was really working on that one because Gundam
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:55.680]   That's how much I don't know about
[01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:59.200]   You know, I realize you know
[01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:01.920]   My kids actually know all the words the Hamilton they could probably
[01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:07.280]   We would probably do and that sounds like a a kid project. That'd be awesome. Yeah. Yeah
[01:20:07.280 --> 01:20:13.600]   Just I gotta get some Mac stuff in there because people always say where's your Mac news good news
[01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:18.000]   It was the best fiscal year for the Macintosh product line ever
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:23.840]   By by revenue no all max 25.8 billion powered not by the iMac
[01:20:23.840 --> 01:20:29.520]   But mostly by the Mac book pro interesting which everybody well I hated I hate a lot of people hated
[01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:32.080]   But but people bought in droves
[01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:36.880]   25 increase year over year in Mac revenue
[01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:43.120]   Probably gonna succumb and that's really unit sales not prices went up a little bit, but I think that's mostly unit sales
[01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:46.880]   I'm kind of waiting for one more upgrade for the
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:49.680]   To move like Andy says there's no alternative for people
[01:20:49.680 --> 01:20:51.680]   They have to but if they want to macbook pro they have to buy that one
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:55.760]   But I would be really interested to see what apple could do if they made an iMac pro version of the macbook pro
[01:20:55.760 --> 01:21:00.720]   Where they said okay, we've heard you here's your mac pro with everything else and then let them get in the wild
[01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:02.880]   I I'm not predicting anything, but
[01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:08.080]   I'm pretty ready to see a dramatically redesigned
[01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:12.480]   Macbook pro next year at least with a new keyboard. There's such
[01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:19.360]   Uh, now there's now there's now that they've been in the field for a number of months where there's a lot of blog posts
[01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:24.720]   A lot of users are have been saying that now that there there's some crud underneath some of the keys and now the
[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:28.400]   Some of my favorite letters the alphabet no longer work or they're unreliable
[01:21:28.400 --> 01:21:34.480]   It's it might be more trouble. I don't know what the advantage of from a manufacturing point of view for apple
[01:21:34.480 --> 01:21:36.720]   I would I would have to say that though
[01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:41.440]   I believe that on a list of things that apple would change about an upcoming macbook
[01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:45.360]   And this is not just personal preference. I think the keyboard is kind of on that list right now
[01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:53.200]   But i'm curious it's it's it's hard to it's hard to say when you have a the mac platform where people literally have to wait years for
[01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:58.720]   A new model that looks materially different like a material upgrade from what you've got right now
[01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:01.440]   It's hard to gauge how much is genuine?
[01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:03.440]   anticipation of
[01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:09.120]   Response to the product itself and how much of it is I have been waiting for four years now for a brand new macbook
[01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:11.520]   I've been holding on to my power pc
[01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:14.160]   version of the mac or whatever
[01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:18.720]   So i'm it's it's interesting. I hope I hope that someone forwards that report
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:22.720]   That those numbers to apple because if they see those numbers they might actually show some
[01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:25.600]   Real interest in the mac in the future
[01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:31.600]   It's just in don't trump just got 280 characters on his twitter account stand back
[01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:36.480]   And we all I think we just want to lie for everybody. Do we all get it? I think it just went live for everybody
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:41.520]   Really, let me see. Let me tweet. Let's tweet
[01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:48.480]   We're doing because my tweeting my oh my 140 character tweets are still going to be that much more valuable to people. Yeah
[01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:50.880]   Damn it
[01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:52.960]   Saw business insider saying it just went live for
[01:22:52.960 --> 01:22:55.200]   I think it's gonna have a thousand characters
[01:22:55.200 --> 01:22:56.240]   Huh?
[01:22:56.240 --> 01:23:00.480]   Some some guys they had their they got suspended for I think some German research. Oh, they found a hack
[01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:05.440]   Yeah, well, they just put one long giant url in there and it was it turned out it was an actual act of url
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:10.240]   So they were it was that url was 35,000. Yeah, but the shortener made it t dot c o
[01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:16.000]   Blah, I mean you did something broke a whole bunch of things on it's the first it's the first is the first successful like
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:20.640]   implementation of doom like inside a url just lots of javascript
[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:25.760]   Playable doom game check your twitter's guys. You any of you?
[01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:27.920]   Let me see
[01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:32.080]   I'm hoping that I maybe we should create a new new statistic called the twitter era
[01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:39.120]   So that it's not just the how long how long the tweets are it's like how valuable is each character
[01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:43.120]   Price product earnings
[01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:46.720]   Congratulations leo you've you've you've
[01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:49.360]   There you go
[01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:51.360]   I still have a just for it
[01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:56.320]   I was just I was just gonna say there was taking a long time for twitter to load there must be because you just you've been you've been hyping
[01:23:56.320 --> 01:23:58.320]   I broke twitter you think no
[01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:06.400]   Anyway, let's uh, let's see apple services we get with the last thing we'll cover from this quarterly report
[01:24:06.400 --> 01:24:10.960]   huge growth in services 8.5
[01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:13.760]   billion in revenue up from
[01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:20.720]   7.3 last quarter seven the quarter before I mean this is massive growth year over year
[01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:26.640]   Uh, this is uh, what about 30% maybe a little bit more growth so
[01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:31.760]   Uh, what is that? What is app? What is apple services?
[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:38.480]   And why is it growing so fast apple music apple pay app store? I mean app store revenue still continues to grow
[01:24:38.480 --> 01:24:43.120]   Um apple music still continue to grow you think it's apple music can't be that much
[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:44.400]   I
[01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:49.040]   Probably a huge amount of stores probably a percentage of that and apple pay is doing quite well
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:52.480]   Although somebody I just saw a story that said walmart's doing even better with it's walmart
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:56.240]   I spent my morning on that story. So this is a story. There's a survey that says that
[01:24:56.720 --> 01:24:58.720]   walmart pay is
[01:24:58.720 --> 01:25:04.080]   Is going to crush apple because it is used more because it is used more in stores
[01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:07.600]   That have it than apple is where walmart does not allow apple pay
[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:10.000]   Yep
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:14.960]   And the graphs of all different scales they're like it's it's apple and cider did a really good job breaking down the numbers too
[01:25:14.960 --> 01:25:21.360]   But it was another words don't it felt like walmart p.r. Being pushed through bloomberg. Yeah, thank you bloomberg
[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:23.920]   I want to read those pr state
[01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:26.320]   Press releases a little bit better
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:30.560]   Take a good break coming back with more our show today brought to you by
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:38.160]   The massively phenomenal ring video doorbell. I love my ring. It's a doorbell replaced my regular doorbell
[01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:40.640]   I have a wired doorbell. You can do it with an unwired
[01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:44.960]   Uh door or anywhere really if you want you can put on your bedroom door if you wanted
[01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:47.840]   But uh my outside door wired doorbell
[01:25:47.840 --> 01:25:52.880]   I just by the way, I know that my xbox just came because I saw the video on my ring video doorbell
[01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:55.120]   All right, it's there though. Not here
[01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:57.760]   um
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:05.920]   It's a doorbell that pairs to your you join it joins your wi-fi has a high def camera on it has a microphone a
[01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:09.120]   speaker on it and motion sensing on it
[01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:15.280]   So when anybody walks up your path you see it you get a ping if you want you get a ping on your phone no matter where you are
[01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:17.280]   anywhere in the world
[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:23.600]   You you when somebody rings your doorbell your phone can go ding dong and you can answer it because it's got a speaker
[01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:25.920]   They can talk to you because it's got a microphone
[01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:29.440]   You never miss another package
[01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:34.960]   You can watch those packages make sure they're safe and now there's the ring floodlight cam
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:36.720]   I love this
[01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:39.840]   led first of all this you've probably seen the floodlights
[01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:43.920]   Around your house their motion sensitive, right? They turn on a lot of people have those
[01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:49.280]   These are led lights, but imagine if you took that in fact you can replace it directly with this
[01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:56.080]   This is from ring the ring floodlight cam and added a camera a microphone a speaker and an alarm plus a big light on it
[01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:57.760]   now
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:02.400]   We're talking the ultimate in home security the floodlights are high visibility
[01:27:02.400 --> 01:27:07.520]   Convenient for you when you walk down, you know to get the garbage cans to put outside or whatever

[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:25.120]   Uh, let's see more news in the apple world
[01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:30.880]   I caught an apple music generate more revenue than ipad and apple watch combined
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:37.120]   That's that services story. Is that true? I don't know. I mean it's wild
[01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:41.600]   Do they break do they break down services by component?
[01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:43.760]   They don't
[01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:46.560]   Do they well they break down ipad and mac sales
[01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:50.640]   But I mean sometimes we know app store number separately other would be watch
[01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:55.200]   So basically I don't know if you added other and ipads
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:29:01.280]   I like that I would like them to make the app store into a separate item
[01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:06.720]   Because oh boy does it make a lot of money. Yeah 30% of everything. Yeah
[01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:10.640]   That's all my pokeball's money
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:13.680]   That's right. They get 30% of one of
[01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:17.840]   Renee's and plenty balls. Yeah, and all your simpson stuff. Well, all my simpson's donuts
[01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:21.120]   They got I spent a $300 in simpson's donuts. They got a hundred bucks
[01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:25.280]   And people are saying the double crossing is going to be a super windfall for everybody
[01:29:25.280 --> 01:29:31.040]   That's a big game on nintendo right animal crossing an xbox. So it's coming to the iPhone
[01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:35.840]   Yeah, and apparently their microtransactions are highly addicted. So we'll see how that oh boy
[01:29:36.880 --> 01:29:45.360]   Uh, I wonder if Jason can do the his next bar graph on how much revenue does apple get from rene's watch band purchases versus his pokemon
[01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:49.680]   And game purchases. Okay, I don't want to know any
[01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:52.400]   Ignorous bliss
[01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:59.200]   We had uh brian x chin from the new york times there uh their tech guy uh on the twitch show on sunday
[01:29:59.200 --> 01:30:02.000]   Actually for sunday, we call him brian 10 gen
[01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.640]   Just
[01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:12.320]   Uh, but he said this was happening to him and it did not happen to me if you type the letter i on on some ios 11 devices
[01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:17.520]   It replaces it with an a and a happening to me square with a question mark you're getting it
[01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:23.360]   Amegan said she was originally an a but now it's an exclamation mark and a question mark inside the box like it's mutating leo
[01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:26.240]   What is going on apples fix for it right?
[01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:28.400]   They say they'll fix it in a patch some sometimes soon
[01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:32.560]   But the fix right now is to use set up a autocorrect to replace it
[01:30:33.280 --> 01:30:39.280]   What it what it looks like it's doing is that for some reason the autocorrect dictionary got poisoned and instead of auto correcting a small
[01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:44.320]   A lower case i to an uppercase i it's correcting it to an uppercase i with what i believe is a non
[01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:48.800]   A non-break space for emoji conjoining uh, which can properly be rendered
[01:30:48.800 --> 01:30:54.880]   So then it ends up spitting out this character which is like exclamation mark square blocks with either an a or a question mark
[01:30:54.880 --> 01:31:00.960]   And they've got a push what you can override it because you can set your own text replacement and force lower case
[01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:03.120]   I to be uppercase i with no garbage next to it
[01:31:03.120 --> 01:31:05.520]   But otherwise they're going to push out a replacement that fixes
[01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:11.360]   There's no truth to the rumor that this is a machine learning system gone ry and this is the first step
[01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:17.200]   No truth to that it came up it came up a lot because there was a twitter meme
[01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:23.520]   Where you would type i was born and then let autocorrect fill in your biography
[01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:30.080]   Or i died and let it in a lot of people went a question mark was born
[01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:37.200]   You saw that and went what and so my favorite was uh jeremy bergie's a moji pedia guy i hope i'm pronouncing his name right where he
[01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:39.200]   Greaded the iphone 10 um
[01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:44.320]   Graphic with the a square bracket phone 10 our biggest
[01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:46.960]   chief yet
[01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:53.440]   That was outstanding speaking of apple pay apple pay cash launches for some of you today. I don't know anybody get it here
[01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:57.680]   In beta this lets you send and receive cash from messages
[01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:00.720]   Wow
[01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:03.680]   It's just part of the public beta some developers just saying they see it as well
[01:32:03.680 --> 01:32:08.160]   But apples officially saying the public beta you have to be on the latest version 11.2 beta 2
[01:32:08.160 --> 01:32:15.040]   Yep, and then so you can opt into that in the us only yeah, oh us only so you wouldn't get it. Yeah, okay
[01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:18.000]   So you could opt into that
[01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:24.640]   Uh, and then you might be offered but then you have to find somebody you you want to spend send money to and then you have to have money to send
[01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:30.480]   Well, it'll pull from your from your account whatever account is in there to start sending money when you receive money
[01:32:30.480 --> 01:32:36.640]   It'll start filling up the apple cash card. Oh, so the source of funding any debit or credit card you have in your apple pay
[01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:39.040]   And there are no fees charged at least for now
[01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:42.960]   If it's a debit card and an industry standard fee for credit cards
[01:32:42.960 --> 01:32:47.040]   Which probably is the few percent the credit card company charges apple for that
[01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:54.400]   The first time someone sends you money you'll you will opt in to accept it and be issued a new virtual apple pay cash card
[01:32:55.120 --> 01:32:56.560]   Oh
[01:32:56.560 --> 01:33:01.440]   So this car yeah, I don't want that this car can only be used to send money or pay for things via apple pay
[01:33:01.440 --> 01:33:06.400]   So it's not like it's like a buffer. It's like a buffer for the system. So you can send and receive money in and out cash out
[01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:10.880]   Yeah, it'll go to your bank account. Um, I believe it works fundamentally the way other
[01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:16.560]   Pay system do and Matthew paiderino tweeted that it also has an optical effect on the card based on the accelerometers
[01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:18.560]   So it moves around like a holiday like that
[01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:23.680]   Design details. I kind of like that apple's working with green dot
[01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:29.680]   Uh to do the back end on this. Yeah, I find the cash card interesting
[01:33:29.680 --> 01:33:36.880]   Well, it's it's it's an important thing that makes things work the moving money from one bank to another is really complicated
[01:33:36.880 --> 01:33:40.400]   It can be really expensive that's super smart of apple to do this
[01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:46.480]   Basically giving you an apple bank account where maybe you will let maybe you would prefer to let all these
[01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:48.720]   $3 for cup of coffee
[01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:54.400]   Display the check for $13 here kind of accumulate and only when you notice that you've got $100 in there make the transfer
[01:33:54.400 --> 01:34:00.560]   So now you've taken a dozen two dozen little transactions and turned them into one big transaction
[01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:05.680]   Which it makes it really really simple and and all the cases where I paid
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:09.920]   I have I meet with friends for breakfast every week every couple weeks
[01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:13.200]   So sometimes i'm paying in sometimes i'm paying sometimes
[01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:18.640]   So if you if sometimes it's like the same $11 that just moves between four friends every week
[01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:22.160]   So that $11 maybe will never actually leave
[01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:27.920]   The this apple buffer, uh, which makes it simple apple controls that entire part of the transaction
[01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:32.160]   You never have to contact a bank and negotiate with them for for things to work
[01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:37.520]   Uh, so I don't I don't it's not as though apple is trying to create a brand new kind of currency and create their own banking system
[01:34:37.520 --> 01:34:41.520]   It's just a convenience feature. I think that's just makes things more simpler
[01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:44.800]   It's not like that, but it could be like that. Yeah
[01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:49.040]   I mean you're talking about stepping
[01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:50.720]   It's a very it's a very slow
[01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:52.720]   I said apple was gonna come in a bank
[01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:58.160]   Apple's the only company that is only company in the world is positioned to be able to do that because they they could literally
[01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:04.480]   Their banking and loan could could be only to pay for people who are borrowing money to buy their products
[01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:08.320]   You know and you'd have to have like 200 billion dollars to get it off the ground and
[01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:12.400]   There were some people who were saying they were already trying to use it to go around points of term
[01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:18.240]   Like they were going to stores and you know, I you just just pay apple pay me the cash to get around point of sale system
[01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:21.040]   So that'll be interesting as well. I'm kind of in businesses
[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:23.120]   I'm kind of fascinated with the apple
[01:35:23.120 --> 01:35:25.440]   the zero cost transaction on
[01:35:25.440 --> 01:35:30.960]   In apple pay means theoretically you could give it to somebody in another country like western union
[01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:34.720]   Like I mean, you know, like you could just say I want to give so I want to give my
[01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:38.640]   You know, let's say i'm from Zimbabwe and I live in london and I want to send money back
[01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:43.520]   I could be using apple pay theoretically if there was someone on the other side that would take up pay but um
[01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:47.680]   It's just an interesting from remittance from a remittance perspective from
[01:35:47.680 --> 01:35:50.320]   um, you know people start
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:52.480]   Paying each other in apple pay
[01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:58.640]   It's just it's just an interesting. No, it's just it could act, you know not accidentally, but it could very slowly
[01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:04.960]   Um turn into a really big part of what apple does one's and that's that's a that's a big part of how money works
[01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:06.960]   These days I get I get paid for
[01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:15.040]   A podcast or two in paypal and because the last thing I ever want to do is hook up paypal to any of my bank accounts
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:20.240]   It just sort of stays there for little transactions that are sort of personal one-to-one
[01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:23.440]   Uh, yes, I do buy things from b&h photos stuff like that
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:29.360]   But oftentimes it's that oh, yeah, I would love to take that off your hands if you're kind of just throw away this old computer
[01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:33.120]   I'll pay pal you whatever cost for shipping and the amount of money for a beer or whatever
[01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:38.080]   It's it really is that we don't need to go through a big bank to do the transactions
[01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:45.120]   It's okay to simply say I've got a pot full of money that can be that can be easily represented as electrons and easily
[01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:52.000]   Cut and paste for one place to another. So yeah, it would be intriguing if apple decided to do a
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:55.760]   Decided to make this a little bit more abstract in a year or two
[01:36:55.760 --> 01:37:00.720]   And try to make it as a really easy way to move money from one person to another
[01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:04.960]   Whether it's your whether's the person who the kid who's shuffling the shoveling your snow
[01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:08.240]   During december whether it's someone on edsy
[01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:14.480]   Or whether it is b&h photo. You just want the simplest way on an Amtrak train because I don't know
[01:37:14.480 --> 01:37:19.920]   Let's say you took your your 10 pound tripod on a one-day trip to New York city with you
[01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:25.440]   And then you only then realize that you didn't have the plate that needs to be on the top of the tripod connected to your camera
[01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:28.080]   So you have to spend 30 dollars for another copy of the
[01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:33.280]   That's never happened to me. Oh wait didn't happen to me yesterday. No suri bob
[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:36.480]   A scary thing is it shows up in your quick reply options
[01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:45.520]   So it's even easier to accidentally send somebody money here's matthew panzerino's tweet with the iridescent effect that appears on your
[01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:47.760]   Oh, wow
[01:37:47.760 --> 01:37:48.720]   Ooh
[01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:53.280]   This is liner stuff so much it's like a hologram. So as you tilt or twist the phone the colors
[01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:58.080]   Change on the card as if it were a real card, but you know, it's what's interesting is
[01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:03.280]   Has has the phrase no let's not do that that would be a total waste of time and resources
[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:05.440]   Has that phrase ever been uttered inside?
[01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:07.840]   Can't be delightful. That's the criteria
[01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:12.960]   But at some point somebody saw it that is what do you call those those delightful provenance?
[01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:14.800]   Delights. Yeah. Yeah
[01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:21.040]   It's interesting that the buying the buying that apple has put everybody in and this is what people worry about when we talk about antitrust
[01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:23.520]   I mean apples not anywhere near antitrust with this but but the
[01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:26.080]   um, but like for instance
[01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:30.640]   The banks had a situation where apple when apple pay came out if they didn't support them
[01:38:30.640 --> 01:38:34.240]   most people will put a card into their apple pay and then
[01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:38.960]   90% of them will never put another card in like it's this the one that they pay with on their apple pay
[01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:44.000]   Um, and so so the banks had to jump in because if they didn't jump in they were gonna miss you know
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:47.600]   They may get eliminated, you know from that person's use use case
[01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:51.520]   Um, and then you have retailers who for you know, bocked at it to some degree
[01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:55.840]   But then you have if if you have retailers that are in a highly commoditized market like a drug store
[01:38:56.400 --> 01:39:00.560]   Uh, I know that there were when right aid I think wasn't using it or whatever
[01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:02.160]   I just stopped going because there's a wallmark
[01:39:02.160 --> 01:39:06.400]   There's a wall green is right across the street and I can just go to that one and I don't have to deal with you know
[01:39:06.400 --> 01:39:12.720]   I don't have to deal with it, you know, and so uh, so they pressured a lot of the people and it's got to freak banks out to see apple put
[01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:17.520]   Something anything that looks like a credit card on the car on the thing that is not a credit card has got it
[01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:21.360]   If it doesn't worry master card and visa and american express it should
[01:39:22.320 --> 01:39:26.240]   It was funny because right away george just started texting me five dollars five dollars five dollars
[01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:28.880]   And I can point out that that does not work you have to authorize it
[01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:31.520]   You can't just have an annoying friend try to take money from you
[01:39:31.520 --> 01:39:37.120]   The number one emoji at least among iphone users is
[01:39:37.120 --> 01:39:39.760]   tears of joy
[01:39:39.760 --> 01:39:43.360]   But I think of that more as ruffle rolling on the floor laughing kind of
[01:39:43.360 --> 01:39:48.560]   45 degree one is technically rolling so this is i'm just
[01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:51.520]   Has so happy I could cry what is this right to the next?
[01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:53.680]   I tend to
[01:39:53.680 --> 01:40:00.160]   I tend to read that as 2017 has finally broken my sanity that I just cannot stop historically and
[01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:02.480]   Tragically laughing at everything that I see everything
[01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:05.200]   Holly that's what that is. Oh, holly
[01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:13.040]   Uh, the folks at mac rumors called our friend jeremy bird who's the vice chair unicodes emoji subcommittee
[01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:18.240]   Jeremy's been on our show several times talking about emojis. He says that's pretty he runs
[01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:25.360]   Emoji pedia. He says that pretty much is what's number one on emoji pedia in fact the apple list pretty much
[01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:27.920]   tracks with emoji pedia. It's uh
[01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:30.720]   face with tears then heart then
[01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:36.960]   Face crying then love eyes then blowing a kiss then I don't know looking upwards
[01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:40.000]   I don't know he says the only one that rolling your eyes rolling your eyes
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:44.880]   He says the only one that is very popular with apple users, but not so much on emoji pedia is the skull
[01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:49.600]   It's very metal you're dead to me
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:52.720]   Apparently the apple users like to send skulls
[01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:57.760]   This is using apple's new differential privacy technology by the way
[01:40:57.760 --> 01:41:03.200]   My mom uses that thinking face all the time since it came out. I keep getting text from the one little thinking this one the
[01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:10.640]   Yeah, yeah, you're rubbing your chin. Are you running late? Yes mom. I am. Yes. Yes. I can't wait till those are animated
[01:41:10.640 --> 01:41:14.720]   That's all I'm saying that I can sit there and have a little guy with my mouth in my eyes
[01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:20.000]   Yes, but you can sit there. I'm talking while you're like, I'm just thinking about this for a second and I'm not sure what I'm gonna do with it
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:25.040]   That would can you write that app you could write that app?
[01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:27.200]   I'm not gonna write that. Go to work
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:30.240]   Get well get one of your people to do it. He is to learn when to say no
[01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:32.000]   Justin
[01:41:32.000 --> 01:41:37.040]   Just in time for my birthday pixel mader on November 29th is giving me a gift in all of us
[01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:41.520]   The new pixel mader pro we've seen a lot of teases for that on the pixel mader site
[01:41:42.320 --> 01:41:44.320]   $9,000
[01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:46.240]   This is using core ml
[01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:48.320]   Which is apples machine learning tool set?
[01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:51.360]   Interesting. What do you think?
[01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:54.000]   Is it great work? Are we excited?
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:57.360]   Oh, yeah
[01:41:57.360 --> 01:42:01.040]   Turn that music down. I would okay
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:07.600]   I think that we are definitely getting to a point where adobe starting to see some some serious competition between this
[01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:12.720]   Japanese you know, there's a huge market there that a lot of people are trying to get themselves into and
[01:42:12.720 --> 01:42:16.640]   Uh, I think adobe's having you know, I mean, they're obviously still
[01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:22.720]   The standard with the change in light room, uh, you know now it's a subscription only product
[01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:29.760]   Uh, you know who's really benefiting pixel mader somewhat, but but the companies that make light room clones, right? That's the affinity
[01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:33.920]   Photo which we really like from serif serif says yeah, we're working on
[01:42:34.400 --> 01:42:38.960]   Adding the one thing that's missing from a fitty a photo that light room has which is managing your photos
[01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:44.160]   They call it digital asset management or dam and aperture is still dead how ironic aperture
[01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:50.800]   Yeah, there's a apple apple you missed you missed the boat. Uh, i'm sure I don't know if pixel mader's planning that mac fun
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:53.520]   We've talked about mac fun many times. I like their affinity
[01:42:53.520 --> 01:43:00.720]   Not affinity, um lumenar product. I think it's really nice, but it doesn't have damn they say they're adding that right early next year
[01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:04.400]   And they've made that interestingly windows as well as mac even though their name is mac fun
[01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:13.280]   I think they're changing their name. I think for for most people for most people. I think that they could for all using pixel mader or affinity. Um, I think are
[01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:17.040]   Uh, I think that both of those
[01:43:17.040 --> 01:43:21.280]   If I was getting started, I would get started on those I don't think I mean people talk about photoshop elements
[01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:24.480]   And I would never get photoshop elements because it's it's purposefully kept behind
[01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:29.440]   You know rather than being you know pixel mader and affinity you're getting into an ecosystem where they're gunning for
[01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:33.680]   You know for photoshop people like me. I still use photoshop
[01:43:33.680 --> 01:43:37.280]   Um because I've been using it since 1991 muscle memory
[01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:42.160]   Yeah, I just like I don't I can't I I have the other two and I do do things like affinity
[01:43:42.160 --> 01:43:47.280]   Is the only app that can properly remove tripods from 360 photos if you're using a theta?
[01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:48.480]   um
[01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:53.360]   And uh, you know, I think pixel mader is great and the performance is really great and um and we put it on all of the
[01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:56.400]   Company machines, but I still miss photoshop all our company machines
[01:43:56.400 --> 01:44:02.480]   We don't get photoshop for it. We just get pixel mader because most of what you need to do is fix a little photo or paint something out or whatever
[01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:04.240]   You don't need photoshop to do that
[01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:08.800]   And so all the company machines have pixel mader a handful of us have photoshop because
[01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:12.800]   We know how to use it if you don't like I'm not going to teach anybody in the company how to use photoshop
[01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:15.760]   If they don't come knowing how to use it, they're not going to get photoshop
[01:44:15.760 --> 01:44:19.920]   This might uh kind of win you over. They're also doing vector mader
[01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:23.760]   They're going to go after illustrator with a vector graphics
[01:44:24.320 --> 01:44:31.360]   Program, this is for the mac what a clever name. I have to admit that I still think vote that illustrator six was pretty much the pinnacle of
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:32.880]   of uh
[01:44:32.880 --> 01:44:38.240]   Of illustrator and then after that it just got heavy and difficult and yeah full and um
[01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:42.720]   Well, you might like actually by the way vector mader is in pixel mader. Yep. Oh wow
[01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:44.640]   Okay
[01:44:44.640 --> 01:44:50.080]   Yeah, well, I think pixel mader pro is going to be a must buy another 20 and not to take anything away from these companies because they are brilliant
[01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:54.240]   And they work super hard, but there's so many technologies that they can benefit from from core animation
[01:44:54.480 --> 01:44:59.840]   Yes core ml to metal to all those things that that just give them a head started to being competitive
[01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:04.080]   Yeah, and again, I wonder how I think that those I think photoshop and illustrator have a very
[01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:11.360]   Useful position where there's a lot of high-end designers and and so on so forth that you need every all those crazy tools and all the crazy stuff is
[01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:13.600]   Is a reaction to a request?
[01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:19.120]   But the learning curve now is so high on most of those. I think it's yeah, that's that's why I wonder how
[01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:28.400]   Long it's going to be before these sort of apps seem old hat old hat where there is an explicit toolbox of tools to use to apply to the image
[01:45:28.400 --> 01:45:30.400]   as opposed to
[01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:36.640]   There is enough machine learning going on in the background. There's enough these apps particularly app like photoshop particularly
[01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:45.360]   Instagram particularly apps that see millions and millions of photos routinely to know pretty much what someone wants to do with a photo of someone
[01:45:45.360 --> 01:45:47.280]   holding
[01:45:47.280 --> 01:45:50.320]   Someone hugging their their their spouse in front of the Eiffel Tower
[01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:53.920]   It's like you definitely want the the faces to be brightened up
[01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:58.720]   You definitely want to see those clouds in the background. You definitely want people to see that's the Eiffel Tower
[01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:02.720]   As opposed to okay, we're going to mask this this off
[01:46:02.720 --> 01:46:06.640]   We're going to put the slider so that we're changing the luminance of the blues
[01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:13.120]   And I think that we're we're working towards an era where there will be no sliders whatsoever. It will just be
[01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:16.080]   something like an enhanced version of
[01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:20.240]   The the assistant and google photos where it will just simply you take pictures
[01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:22.960]   And then by the time you get back to your hotel
[01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:25.200]   It gives you a wallet of photos
[01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:29.760]   That says here's some stuff that we did with your photos pick the ones that you like and we'll add them to the library
[01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:35.760]   And if this if it's not and with the also with the added ability of saying I like this, but I have notes
[01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:38.080]   And it asks you okay. What's a tap the
[01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:44.640]   Rub your fingertip on the parts that you wish were different and we'll try to see we know what people don't like about things
[01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:48.480]   They don't like things. It's I think we're moving towards for the most part
[01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:55.360]   Automatic there's enough computing power enough knowledge that it can just sort of generate different versions of a picture
[01:46:55.360 --> 01:47:00.560]   And then leave it to the human to pick the version of the photo they like as opposed to giving them the obligation of figuring out
[01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:03.360]   How to fix the photo to look exactly the way they want to look at yeah
[01:47:03.360 --> 01:47:05.120]   I mean, I think you could you could have it where you say
[01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:10.240]   I want this person and this person standing next to each other and I want this background and it takes
[01:47:10.640 --> 01:47:15.760]   It just comps them in front of the background and it takes the color from the background and recolor relights them
[01:47:15.760 --> 01:47:19.760]   So that it they match each other and they look like they belong to that and I don't think that that's
[01:47:19.760 --> 01:47:25.680]   A far way from me saying actually, you know what that I took that selfie with my sunglasses
[01:47:25.680 --> 01:47:28.960]   The reflection in my sunglasses is actually a much better picture
[01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:32.960]   Could you like correct for the distortion and make that into a picture?
[01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:36.560]   Zoom resolve zoom resolve enhance
[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:40.480]   Gentlemen get your pics ready
[01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:43.360]   I'm gonna wrap things up with your pics of the week in just a second
[01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:48.240]   But first a word from our sponsor video blocks by story blocks. This is something you can all
[01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:54.640]   Use video blocks is great if you need a quick sound bite or video, uh, you need a after effects
[01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:57.440]   uh
[01:47:57.440 --> 01:48:04.160]   A template you need motion backgrounds video and by the way, we've used a lot of these kind of clips
[01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:08.640]   I know you do Alex too and they're expensive these royalty-free clips can add up
[01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:12.160]   To quite a bit or you pay a monthly fee of hundreds of dollars
[01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:14.960]   Probably when we found video blocks went crazy
[01:48:14.960 --> 01:48:17.600]   one year unlimited use
[01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:19.440]   one year
[01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:21.440]   $149 one year

[01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:42.240]   They are always adding new clips. That's not all you also get a fair. I think a very nice
[01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:47.680]   Feature they have a marketplace which I love because the creators get 100% of the sale price
[01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:49.920]   So it's really just a
[01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:52.960]   It's like they they provide a place for creators to put clips
[01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:59.040]   And you'll say 40% as a member and have access to an additional 5 million videos
[01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:03.280]   They are to get the money you get the break everybody's happy
[01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:08.880]   I love video blocks and stop using footage with watermarks. Come on man
[01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:13.680]   Video blocks has been used by over 90,000 customers including big boys like nbc
[01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:18.000]   National Geographic the history channel the travel channel

[01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:42.800]   From video blocks, you know
[01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:43.760]   It's nice

[01:49:55.200 --> 01:49:57.680]   Mac break from story blocks rene richy
[01:49:57.680 --> 01:50:01.760]   Pick of the week by friend snapchat spectacles. No wait. No
[01:50:01.760 --> 01:50:05.680]   There's quite a few available if if you want in the warehouse
[01:50:05.680 --> 01:50:12.960]   Yeah, they're having a bad day. Oh, so my actual pick is card hop now card hop you might be familiar with me. I love these
[01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:14.080]   Is yeah
[01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:19.440]   So I've been hearing about this for a while because I talked to michael semons from flexibits every once in a while
[01:50:19.440 --> 01:50:22.800]   And you know he was just saying we're working on this and I'm like, what could they possibly do?
[01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:26.320]   It's a contact app. It is them. It is more boring than calendar
[01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:28.320]   What could you possibly do with it?
[01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:31.840]   And he's like just you wait and see just you wait and see and then I got in on the beta
[01:50:31.840 --> 01:50:36.720]   And I after using it. I first of all their icon is spectacular. It's david lannam from
[01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:43.200]   The icon factory and it's it's a BLT sandwich with a contact card stabbed on it and I'm biting it out of it
[01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:45.600]   Which is just fan of tabulous
[01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:50.400]   But what they did is they didn't make a contact app they made sort of like a connection launcher
[01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:56.480]   So it sits up in your menu bar and it's got everything that was great about fantastical which is very quick natural language
[01:50:56.480 --> 01:50:59.040]   uh querying and input
[01:50:59.040 --> 01:51:01.440]   But it's applied to people now so you can
[01:51:01.440 --> 01:51:05.600]   Uh, for example, you can see your recents and you can see birthdays if that's what you have set up
[01:51:05.600 --> 01:51:09.120]   So that's fine, but I never use it that way. I just start typing like I can type leo
[01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:15.200]   Email and it'll start an email to leo it can I can type leo call and it'll use either call relay or face time
[01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:20.000]   Calling to to call you and it makes it almost like spotlight or Alfred
[01:51:20.080 --> 01:51:24.400]   Or a quick silver for connecting to people and you can add data too
[01:51:24.400 --> 01:51:26.960]   So if I say like if I find out and he was born on christmas day
[01:51:26.960 --> 01:51:31.440]   I can start typing and you not go December 25th and it'll it'll offer to put that in his birthday
[01:51:31.440 --> 01:51:36.080]   Or if and you know if Alex gets a new, uh, you know an an emoji based email address
[01:51:36.080 --> 01:51:41.680]   I can start typing Alex animoji at Alex.com and it'll just offer to make that I can keep typing work
[01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:45.600]   And it'll make that his work address and your fingers never leave the keyboard
[01:51:45.680 --> 01:51:51.600]   It's immediately you can set a shortcut key. So you just hit that shortcut key start typing hit the button
[01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:54.800]   And you're connecting to anybody you want in any way that you want
[01:51:54.800 --> 01:51:58.160]   And you never see duplicates. You never see just email only contacts
[01:51:58.160 --> 01:52:02.640]   You never see any of that garbage that you have to wait through in traditional contact applications
[01:52:02.640 --> 01:52:06.160]   You just see the sort of information that's immediately actionable
[01:52:06.160 --> 01:52:10.480]   And you don't even have to stop to click on it because you can launch it all right from the app
[01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:14.880]   And I'm refusing about it because it's I hate the people of flux a bit so much
[01:52:15.120 --> 01:52:17.440]   Because I don't have an excuse not to use my calendar anymore
[01:52:17.440 --> 01:52:20.160]   And now I don't have an excuse not to use contacts anymore
[01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:25.200]   And if like forced this productivity on me by making delightful applications leo and frankly i'm sick of it
[01:52:25.200 --> 01:52:31.600]   I'm sick of it. I'm sick of it. I'm sick of it. Yeah, I bought a fantastic cal to and card hop at the same time
[01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:34.480]   Have them both in my menu bar. They they really
[01:52:34.480 --> 01:52:38.560]   Yeah, you would think what do I need it? I'm a get a calendar in contact manager
[01:52:38.560 --> 01:52:42.160]   I don't need another one, but this they really did a great job. I really am impressed
[01:52:42.160 --> 01:52:46.640]   They do and it's beautiful as all their stuff is it looks great and it works so fast
[01:52:46.640 --> 01:52:51.200]   Yeah, very I don't even look for people because upon previously was like I want to contact leo
[01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:54.000]   Which app do I use like I have to think about do I want to email them?
[01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:57.680]   Do I want to message him? Do I want to FaceTime him then I go to the app and then I have to again
[01:52:57.680 --> 01:53:00.160]   Remember who I was and this sounds like it's a super problem
[01:53:00.160 --> 01:53:05.040]   But you have to every time you change context the human brain is not good at that and you might get oh look a tweet happened
[01:53:05.040 --> 01:53:08.160]   Then I'll forget about it and with this I just I know it's leo
[01:53:08.160 --> 01:53:11.520]   And then I just keep typing and I get the method I want to contact him by and it's so fast
[01:53:12.080 --> 01:53:14.080]   Very nice
[01:53:14.080 --> 01:53:19.920]   Alex Lindsey I bet you have something jolly good for us two things two things one one little one little more expensive
[01:53:19.920 --> 01:53:21.440]   um
[01:53:21.440 --> 01:53:24.640]   So I'm really into power cables for my devices
[01:53:24.640 --> 01:53:31.280]   And uh this and this one is the the best one I've gotten so far so you I don't know who you've seen this it's braided
[01:53:31.280 --> 01:53:36.400]   I'm really into braided so I like braided I do too. They don't get tangled. This is the nomad all for rugged
[01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:43.920]   Lightning and it it's all true rugged. Is it my MFI? It's MFI okay and
[01:53:43.920 --> 01:53:51.200]   Charges and data and everything yep it does it all and it's um it's it's how this is it just burly is a good word for it
[01:53:51.200 --> 01:53:53.200]   Yeah, so you always know it's yours
[01:53:53.200 --> 01:53:58.640]   I'd say Apple's cables are not very robust. No, no, I need something better
[01:53:58.640 --> 01:54:02.080]   This is good. How much though? It's like 30 bucks. Yeah, they're pretty a little pricey
[01:54:02.080 --> 01:54:05.200]   But you know what you're getting something nice that won't break. I use it a lot
[01:54:05.200 --> 01:54:08.800]   I like that, you know, I wasn't sure if I'd like this little rubber attachment, but it actually
[01:54:08.800 --> 01:54:12.400]   Oh, no, no, that keeps yeah. Yeah, there's a couple of them I have that are like leather
[01:54:12.400 --> 01:54:15.280]   leather
[01:54:15.280 --> 01:54:17.600]   I don't want leather. I don't want to know
[01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:22.720]   A leather attachment. Have you seen my leather cable? Oh, oh, I love their attachment. This is uh
[01:54:22.720 --> 01:54:27.680]   Nomad and oh ma d can you get them on? I bet you can get them in the Amazon Amazon. Yeah, that's where I got it
[01:54:27.680 --> 01:54:31.120]   And it's um nice. They make they make ones that are like both, uh, you know
[01:54:31.120 --> 01:54:33.600]   They make them a lot of different cables, but that one works really great
[01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:39.200]   Um, and then the other thing that I've been just starting to play with that i'm quite happy with is uh
[01:54:39.200 --> 01:54:41.840]   the new theta
[01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:46.240]   So there's a new one cut staying it. Yeah, I know exactly so I think i'm on my side
[01:54:46.240 --> 01:54:49.600]   I just bought the first two of them now. I get another one. This is another one
[01:54:49.600 --> 01:54:55.840]   So the big advantage here is 4k, so it's 4k video. So the still is the same
[01:54:55.840 --> 01:54:58.000]   Um, it's not going to be
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:01.040]   Still the same resolution as it was before so they haven't changed the chip
[01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:04.400]   What they're doing is I think they've changed the processing so that you can now do
[01:55:04.400 --> 01:55:08.000]   Uh 4k video rather than just 1080p video
[01:55:08.000 --> 01:55:14.000]   Um, and which is really what was missing between uh, the theta and the samseung, you know
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.880]   Because you know as the samseung was always a lot higher resolution on the videos
[01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:19.760]   It can stream. I haven't been able to get that to work yet
[01:55:19.760 --> 01:55:24.320]   So but that's that and then also it has a little surround mic which I just I haven't really used heavily yet
[01:55:24.320 --> 01:55:25.120]   That's neat
[01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:28.800]   So you can have this one thing that a lot of these uh inexpensive 3d cameras
[01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:33.680]   Don't do is surround audio and I really like the I mean I think that's fairly important
[01:55:33.680 --> 01:55:38.720]   The thing to know is that if you're uploading the videos um both facebook and youtube support
[01:55:38.720 --> 01:55:40.640]   You know natively
[01:55:40.640 --> 01:55:43.680]   Yeah, you can you can definitely set puts around you know
[01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:49.280]   Do they do the i surround audio on us also natively? Oh, that's nice. Yeah, so this is uh, so yeah, you can do
[01:55:49.280 --> 01:55:56.640]   So it's less than an osmo. It is it is and I have that too. So anyway, so by the way they they killed that
[01:55:57.200 --> 01:56:04.080]   The osmo. Yeah, they killed it. Oh, you mean the ozo ozo. No, no. Yeah, so they oh, well, that's a long story
[01:56:04.080 --> 01:56:06.080]   But but um I spent
[01:56:06.080 --> 01:56:12.320]   Hundreds of thousands of dollars. I also made hundreds of thousands. Okay. It was like it was like I didn't lose any money
[01:56:12.320 --> 01:56:17.200]   Okay, so um, but uh and I continue to so so the the the issue yeah the ozo
[01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:21.760]   Is not being developed their players still being developed. It's still the only player they can do 4k per i
[01:56:21.760 --> 01:56:23.360]   um
[01:56:23.360 --> 01:56:28.320]   And uh, so so the ozo is still for live production. I'm not going to replace my theta with an ozo
[01:56:28.320 --> 01:56:30.880]   So if I want to do multi-camera live
[01:56:30.880 --> 01:56:36.640]   4k per i kind of work, um, there's still only one camera to use and it's not made anymore. So
[01:56:36.640 --> 01:56:38.320]   um, but uh
[01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:43.520]   Hopefully someone will step into that into that void. Um, but um, yeah, anyway, but the but the
[01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:47.600]   This is what I carry around. I don't what is this was the audio, uh, plug-in cost
[01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:50.160]   I don't remember how you like 450
[01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:54.000]   Update think you know it's gonna take 10 minutes. It's been like 40 minutes. I've been doing high Sierra this whole time
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:56:57.360]   I thought it was gonna take like 10 minutes. It's been like 4 29 95 for the camera
[01:56:57.360 --> 01:57:02.720]   And I think it's like a couple hundred dollars for the surround sound like I think the surround thing really sells it
[01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:06.080]   Yeah, no, it's and it's great because it's just it's built for it. It pops right in it
[01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:10.560]   And we have the senhaiser, which is really great. You know the it's got the four little mics and and um
[01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:12.960]   But uh, you have to mix it again
[01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:17.200]   This is great for me to be able to just throw it in my bag and pull it out nice. So it's good
[01:57:18.160 --> 01:57:24.160]   I hate you. I'm an expensive friend. That's what I said. I bought the mavic pro last time you were here
[01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:30.240]   Which I love I haven't I haven't tested the x7 yet for the for the um for the
[01:57:30.240 --> 01:57:35.680]   Or for the for the uh for the inspire in the osmo. I haven't I'm working on getting that and then man there it is
[01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:43.600]   2 69 95 so that's not an inexpensive package no, but it's pretty great pretty great footage and sound for that price
[01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:48.320]   4k 360 video with surround sound audio
[01:57:48.320 --> 01:57:53.520]   File you can do 4k and it's not it's not that it's new the 4k was
[01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:58.880]   Uh, you know, samsung had 4k before and the garment has 4k
[01:57:58.880 --> 01:58:04.400]   It's it's just the theta form factor is still I think a better form factor to be able to just use it in a lot of different ways
[01:58:04.400 --> 01:58:11.520]   Is it hdr is like 10 bit 4k? No, no, it's not come on. Oh, it's still a room then i'm not by i'm an excuse not to buy it right now
[01:58:11.520 --> 01:58:13.520]   There you go. There you go. I'm waiting for
[01:58:14.320 --> 01:58:17.520]   How do you thank you rene there you go and the anaco pick of the week
[01:58:17.520 --> 01:58:20.640]   I have to guess that the line
[01:58:20.640 --> 01:58:26.800]   Outside the dumpster outside your office is longer than the line to get an iphone 10
[01:58:26.800 --> 01:58:34.800]   I know I know that I would be there like a two in the morning with my the same flash. We are going to do we're
[01:58:34.800 --> 01:58:38.080]   We're we are stacking stuff up
[01:58:38.080 --> 01:58:42.160]   So we're finally by december where we should have all the stuff in the in the in the
[01:58:42.320 --> 01:58:46.320]   Warehouse that we're getting rid of and we haven't figured out what platform we're going to use but it's going to be
[01:58:46.320 --> 01:58:53.760]   Great. That's by the way furball wants. No, is that an Alex that's an Alex. Yes, it is an Alex. That's almost exactly an Alex
[01:58:53.760 --> 01:58:59.280]   All right, Andy. Oh, okay. So, uh, what do you want me to buy now?
[01:58:59.280 --> 01:59:04.560]   Ulysses version 12 already bought it for ios and macos. Yeah, okay
[01:59:04.560 --> 01:59:09.040]   The version 12 came out a couple of weeks ago. I've only gotten around to recommending it this week
[01:59:09.520 --> 01:59:11.520]   It's a really strong update
[01:59:11.520 --> 01:59:14.560]   There are individual features that are nice
[01:59:14.560 --> 01:59:19.440]   But I think the biggest thing is that uh, I love ios apps that
[01:59:19.440 --> 01:59:24.480]   Look like they were written from the ground up for ios 11
[01:59:24.480 --> 01:59:33.440]   As opposed to a mac app that was somehow translated to ios or an ios 6 app that they keep just simply adding compatibility features to
[01:59:33.440 --> 01:59:37.280]   It really is it shows you how beautiful ios 11 can be
[01:59:37.760 --> 01:59:40.640]   Uh, with not just with touch but also with 3d touch
[01:59:40.640 --> 01:59:48.640]   Uh with trying to make use of typography as opposed to like graphical elements that teach you where the things are in this app
[01:59:48.640 --> 01:59:54.000]   Um, it's uh, if you haven't used ulysses before it really is a great text editor
[01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:59.120]   It's not just in not just an open open file edit file closed file
[01:59:59.120 --> 02:00:06.240]   It lets you deal with collections of documents like if you're doing chapters of a book or if you're doing essays for a specific class
[02:00:06.640 --> 02:00:12.640]   And it allows you to really think of what you're writing as libraries of content and organize them quite effectively
[02:00:12.640 --> 02:00:18.640]   Um, it's also extremely clean. It's also one of the best cross platform apps
[02:00:18.640 --> 02:00:25.040]   I've seen ever where if you're deciding if you've decided that you're going to use an ipad as your notebook computer
[02:00:25.040 --> 02:00:29.280]   But you're still going to have a mac at home. It is practically a seamless operation
[02:00:29.280 --> 02:00:35.360]   You'll be putting fingerprint smudges on your mac screen because you expect the screen to interact with your with your touch
[02:00:35.840 --> 02:00:40.640]   Because of how clean a trans a translicion it is between those two platforms
[02:00:40.640 --> 02:00:49.200]   Uh, it's uh, it actually it's it's such a big improvement that it is kind of side by side now with my other favorite word processor
[02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:53.680]   That's called cross platform, which is skrivener. You've heard me, uh, praise this one too
[02:00:53.680 --> 02:00:58.240]   I don't think that it's there's a winner in this race. I think that skrivener is for
[02:00:58.240 --> 02:01:04.240]   Uh, it has has two major advantages one of which is it is a true what you see is what you get text editor
[02:01:04.640 --> 02:01:09.120]   Whereas, uh, you lissey's is all about markdown. So you're not going to necessarily see
[02:01:09.120 --> 02:01:12.480]   Uh formatting changes you're gonna see head headings headers
[02:01:12.480 --> 02:01:15.360]   Heading one heading two heading three
[02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:22.240]   You're it really is a markdown keynotes a lot of people feel that that's actually faster because they're not taking their hands off the keyboard to make
[02:01:22.240 --> 02:01:28.480]   Uh style changes. I mean one of the it's such an aggressive change that one of the big big big changes and
[02:01:29.120 --> 02:01:36.400]   You lissey's 11 is that if you put a picture between two paragraphs now you can see the picture in the document that you're editing
[02:01:36.400 --> 02:01:42.640]   Okay, not in color and black and white, but you can now see the picture and not just a url placeholder for what goes there
[02:01:42.640 --> 02:01:48.800]   Uh, we're ras skrivener is behaves more like what people expect a a word processor to look up look like
[02:01:48.800 --> 02:01:52.560]   The other thing that skrivener does better is that sometimes it's not all about
[02:01:52.560 --> 02:01:55.120]   Documents that you're preparing
[02:01:55.120 --> 02:01:59.120]   For one book that i'm writing i've got pdf's i've got jpegs i've got
[02:01:59.120 --> 02:02:01.920]   Dot mov files i've got urls
[02:02:01.920 --> 02:02:06.480]   So that all the research that i'm doing is right at hand and bundled together with the thing i'm working on
[02:02:06.480 --> 02:02:08.800]   That's not really ulysses strength
[02:02:08.800 --> 02:02:12.640]   But for people who have to write right right right right right and a lot of things that are
[02:02:12.640 --> 02:02:20.080]   Related to each other such as again essays in a school course you're taking or chapters in a book or some or sections of a report
[02:02:20.080 --> 02:02:22.880]   Uh, the ulysses is very very strong
[02:02:23.040 --> 02:02:28.320]   It also makes it very very easy to export it in a format that's going to be useful to you including a word press
[02:02:28.320 --> 02:02:31.040]   uh, word press uh post
[02:02:31.040 --> 02:02:33.760]   It's again very very polished very very nice
[02:02:33.760 --> 02:02:39.360]   Another thing that i like that it was a little bit controversial it seems to be controversial every time a publisher does this
[02:02:39.360 --> 02:02:41.520]   They are moving to a subscription model
[02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:44.640]   So instead of buying it outright as you can do with skrivener
[02:02:44.640 --> 02:02:48.000]   It now costs $40 a year or $5 a month
[02:02:48.720 --> 02:02:53.760]   And a lot of it and some people are complaining that well that means that i'm never not paying for this app
[02:02:53.760 --> 02:02:57.680]   It's going to cost me over the course of a few years. It could cost me as much money as
[02:02:57.680 --> 02:02:59.600]   as as a
[02:02:59.600 --> 02:03:01.600]   As a microsoft word might have or used to
[02:03:01.600 --> 02:03:06.800]   I like that I like to hear when company does that not because I like spending more money for an app
[02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:12.960]   But because I like it when an app I like is going to be on the sort of financial footing where they can continue to
[02:03:12.960 --> 02:03:17.760]   Pay their developers and pay their marketing and continue to put more features and develop into this
[02:03:17.920 --> 02:03:20.160]   Because clearly you compare the ios 11 version
[02:03:20.160 --> 02:03:22.640]   Ulysses 12 of the previous edition
[02:03:22.640 --> 02:03:27.680]   So much work and thought how to go into this to make this happen and i'm glad that someone didn't have to deliver
[02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:30.320]   paper newspapers at 5 a.m
[02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:36.400]   Uh, and didn't do and and and work the fryer of the chicken hut so that they can afford to get home at 11 p.m
[02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:38.400]   And put in five hours of development on this app
[02:03:38.400 --> 02:03:40.640]   So I think it's worth the money they ask for because
[02:03:40.640 --> 02:03:43.280]   Not not to the same extent that
[02:03:43.360 --> 02:03:46.640]   Alex can sometimes buy a hundred thousand dollar thing and make money off of it
[02:03:46.640 --> 02:03:50.960]   It is the sort of thing where if you write for your professional
[02:03:50.960 --> 02:03:53.600]   Professional worker for for pay
[02:03:53.600 --> 02:03:57.760]   It's money that you will make back in the productivity and the inspiration that you get from using it
[02:03:57.760 --> 02:04:03.120]   So Ulysses is definitely my you can get it Ulysses app.com. It's also on the ios app store in the mac app store
[02:04:03.120 --> 02:04:04.800]   mr
[02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:06.640]   Andy and i co mr
