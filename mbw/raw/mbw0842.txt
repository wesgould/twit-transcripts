[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, Andy, Alex, Jason. We're all together today to talk about Apple's
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.320]   incredible quarter and why it might not be such a great quarter last week. I'm just excited that
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:19.200]   Mac sold really well. They won't be selling new Macs this year though. Tim Cook gave us a hint and
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:25.680]   Amazon Prime and its new music. Could it be a threat to Apple music? All that coming up
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:35.680]   just a bit with Mac Break Weekly. Podcasts you love from people you trust. This is great.

[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.200]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover the latest news from Apple. And I came in this
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.880]   morning thinking there was no news, boy, was I wrong because we've got charts Jason Snellis
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.240]   here from six colors.com. I pity that sucker has to bake all those financial shirts about all the
[00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.680]   money Apple made. Oh, it's me. It's you. It's self pity. After all, well, it's good to be here and
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.080]   talk about I made the charts. I might as well talk about do you use all six colors in the charts?
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.120]   I try to. I don't always get to them. I've got like colors mapped to the different categories.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.600]   So like there's a color for services and a color for wearables and Mac. And I guess there's one
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:34.160]   color left for another category. So get on it Apple. Oh, there's a free, free color kids.
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.720]   Apple, you're not you're underachieving. That's that that chuckle is Mr. Andy Inako
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:48.240]   from WGBH in Baston. Hello, Andrew. Hello, Leo. Good to see you. Welcome. Always.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:56.480]   Uh, he is entering the winter months in his fortress of solitude.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:03.360]   Indeed. So this is this is where we kind of stop telling the outsiders this. You're not cold.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.760]   This is just crisp. And we're sorry. Yeah, you know what? Maybe it's maybe it's time to get to get
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:14.800]   out the get that bucket of road salt and have it by the front door. And uh, Mr. Alex Lindsey
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.880]   from Oh, I know dot media and office hours. That global. He's already done more this morning than
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:28.880]   most of us do an entire week. It's up by the way. What's up? Oh, your interview. Oh, I didn't know
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:35.040]   it would be that fast. We're that fast. Should I tweet it or or to? Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Don't tweet
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:41.440]   it. Tweet it. Tweet it. Tweet it. Yeah. Yeah. Where is it up at a gray matter dot?
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.880]   dot show dot show. Great. Great matter dot show.
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.160]   And this is the interview I did last week. Uh, Thursday, Friday. Wow. You almost fast.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:04:01.520]   Season one episode 13. Access the podcast. The shifting says great. It was great. Great.
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:08.640]   interview. I will now copy this and send it over to Elon for approval. Thank you.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:20.160]   Exactly. Thank you for, uh, thank you for your, uh, service. Uh, this is the graph total total
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:27.840]   Apple revenue, 90 revenue governor, 90 billion dollars. It's, uh, what is it? A record quarter
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:36.800]   for the record fiscal fourth calendar, yeah, you for it is once again a record for app. It's, you know,
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:43.600]   it is the most boring and yet impressive run of the company that you think couldn't possibly
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:52.000]   generate more cash continuing to generate more cash every single quarter, even with the, I mean,
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.440]   if you want to talk about foreign exchange headwinds, boy, can I tell you a story about it, but
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.280]   basically even though that a lot of the places where Apple is charging for products, the dollar is
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:08.800]   so strong that it makes their profit from there and their revenue from there, um, diluted because
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:15.040]   the dollar is so strong, they still manage somehow to put up 90 billion in revenue. So it's amazing.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.920]   You know, it's a machine that generates money at this point. That's what it is. 83.4 this year.
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:28.160]   Last time 67 64.7 this year, two years ago, this time two years ago, I mean, it is a record. Also,
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.040]   it's the end of their year, their fiscal year. So we also get, uh, fiscal was it a good year?
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:41.360]   Of course. Yeah. I mean, big surprise. It was a very good year for Max and maybe
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:48.960]   everything else except iPads. The iPad is kind of flat, but yeah, I mean, it is, it is.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:54.080]   I got to put up my charts for the annuals now that the year is closed, but it's the same story,
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:06:01.280]   which is up, up, up. Apple is so much more, you know, a cash generating company that it was.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:07.360]   The rise in the in the 2010s really is the breathtaking thing and they continue doing that.
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:14.320]   And that's the, that's the most impressive thing is 20, 20.7 billion profit in the last three months.
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:19.040]   Yeah. And it's funny because their CFO keeps talking about how they want to go cash neutral.
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.000]   Cause remember, there was a point where they had more than a hundred billion in cash,
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.160]   like stuffed in mattresses somewhere, a hundred billion, billion with a B.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:32.400]   And it's like, it's like almost Sisyphian or like, remember Brewster's millions that,
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:37.920]   that movie where a guy had to try to give away a million dollars. And he couldn't.
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.760]   It's a little light. Look, this is my street, my street's billions.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.560]   He should have bought Twitter. They should have bought Twitter. They could have got it cheap.
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:52.480]   A hundred billion in profit this year. Why five years they've been trying at least five years
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:57.520]   to reduce their cash position. And they still have almost 50 billion dollars in cash. So like,
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.160]   they can't give it away. Well, they do buy back stock. They do.
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:05.600]   Yeah. Yeah. And they acquire apparently a company a month. They're acquiring and still,
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.920]   they just can't get rid of all this cash. You're over your total revenue change 8%.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:15.920]   And I think that the thing that's interesting is a lot of people say, well, the shareholders
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.960]   are getting all this money back, but those, those shareholders, a lot of them are employees.
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:25.520]   So that's true. So we have to remember that a lot of the employees are almost all the employees,
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.040]   or all the employees, I think, if they're, if they're actually an employee of Apple,
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:32.720]   are getting some version of stocks. And so these are by pushing that,
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:39.360]   by providing dividends as well as buybacks, those are all increasing value for their employees
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:44.000]   in addition to the shareholders. Would you rather, as a shareholder have dividends,
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.320]   a buyback increases the value of your stock because they're fewer shares.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:55.360]   Right. Would you rather have dividends or buybacks? It's good for the company to have buybacks.
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:00.880]   I think they do both specifically because some people would like to get money back.
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:06.400]   Like, is that funny? You literally get cash in your pocket exactly, whereas the buybacks are just
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:11.120]   driving the stock upward theoretically. And it's also a taxable event, I believe dividends are.
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.240]   Ah, that's the other side of that. Yeah. So that's, so that's money.
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.920]   Money's always a taxable event when you get it. The profits, you don't get it.
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:24.240]   Money's always a stock, a dividend you get. Yeah. Yeah. Right. 11.5 billion
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:29.040]   Mac revenue. It looks like in all the quarters you've gotten this graph, it's the best Mac
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:34.080]   quarter ever. It is. It's the best Mac quarter ever and three out of the last four,
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:39.040]   four out of the last five. Depending on how you want to count it, you could actually say that
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:44.000]   seven out of the last nine quarters are the best nine or best seven Mac quarters ever.
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:50.160]   I actually think maybe it's even true that like the last nine quarters are the nine best Mac
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:54.960]   quarters ever. It is, the Mac has never generated as much revenue as it is now. I'm glad to hear that.
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:59.120]   That's a Mac. I'm glad to hear that. I'm glad to hear that. Yeah. And it's weird because sequentially
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:04.560]   it's way up from last quarter, but the reason that Apple went into, if you remember back to this
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.880]   like late spring early summer where we were all trying to buy Macs, like Mac studios and
[00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:13.440]   they were three months delay. Basically, they're all their factories that assemble Macs are in
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:20.080]   Shanghai and they shut down and they spent most of last quarter behind. And so they didn't sell very
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:25.360]   many Macs last quarter because they couldn't get them. In fact, revenue last quarter was down 10%
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:30.480]   year over now, but it was up to this quarter. This year, they fulfilled all those orders,
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:35.840]   fulfilled the quarter's worth of orders and filled the channel with Macs to go on store shelves or
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:40.800]   be it Amazon or wherever. And that's part of the reason it was up so much this time is that they
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:47.520]   were really kind of fulfilling last, all the demand that they weren't being able to meet last quarter.
[00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:53.680]   But it does. I mean, if you just look at this graph where this is the dividing point,
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:10:04.160]   it's obvious that the silicon has been a huge, huge boon for Apple. And in the PC side, Intel
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:10.240]   and Qualcomm are still struggling to do anything like the efficiency of this Apple silicon.
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:16.880]   It really is a success. And the problem is it's really hard to do if you're not Apple. So Apple
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:22.640]   has now really forced people to play a game that only it can really play, which is that they own
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:31.120]   the IDE, they own the operating system, they own the hardware. And by doing that, it allows you to
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:36.560]   integrate a bunch of pieces that everybody else has to find their way to a consortium.
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:40.320]   They have to all agree on it. So you have all these different companies with all these different
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:45.200]   ideas of how they want to run it. And they have to all agree to build something that looks like an
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:50.080]   M1 or an M2. And that is incredibly difficult. Or, you know, and as I would put it, it's a
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:56.240]   walled garden all the way down. Yeah. All right. Yeah. I mean, it's, it's, you know,
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:11:00.720]   it's everywhere. Because they bought the plants that made the chips, you know, like, that's the
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:07.840]   one thing they don't. But, you know, in a way, they kind of own TSMZ. I mean, they, they certainly,
[00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:12.640]   they're tightly bound at the hip. iPad revenue kind of flat. Not so good.
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:16.560]   I think it's hard to prove that you need a new one. I mean, like, I,
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:21.360]   good, that's an example of something that's too good. Well, it's, it's that I don't think that
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:26.320]   that we're seeing very many apps. And this is the problem that PCs have is that Excel runs as
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:31.120]   fast as it's ever going to run, you know? And so the, and there's just a lot of people that only use
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:35.200]   a basic version that there's a lot of PCs out there, but they're not, they're not all being used
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:39.360]   in a creative area that really pushes the envelope. And so there's not many times when you feel like
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:43.200]   you hit the top end of your iPad with the apps that are out there. And I think that that's,
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:48.400]   that's a real challenge is to encourage and even, I mean, I think that, I mean, this would be hard
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:53.680]   for Apple to do, but I, I do think that like what Epic has done with the mega grants is genius,
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:58.720]   you know, which is that we have, we want to see people push the envelope out. And, and so we're
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:03.760]   going to, you know, we have a fund to give you money to develop certain kinds of things. So if
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:07.760]   Apple was pushing to, you know, look for, you know, we're looking for things that are really going
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:12.880]   to push the performance of the iPad, any, any dollar they put into that would probably push,
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:17.600]   would make $10 on the other end because it would drive people to buy new iPads because there's a
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:22.160]   really cool app that really uses it, but we don't see much of that at all. Apple is,
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:25.920]   historically doesn't do stuff like that. But boy, if you're trying to get rid of some of that cash
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:34.320]   Luca, hand it off, you know, you see every, every creator space like YouTube and TikTok and Facebook
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:38.800]   all have creator funds where they give money. Epic, that's interesting that Epic does that for
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:43.920]   developers to use the mega grant is really probably one of the best ones out there because if there's
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:48.160]   no strings attached, if they give you the money, if they, the funny thing is, if it's, it's basically
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.920]   talking to people about it that have gotten some of them, if it's under $25,000, you know,
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:54.720]   really need to see anything like they just, they just need to think it's a good idea.
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:58.080]   Just have like, they're not, yeah, they said if it's over $25,000, yeah, you probably need to
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:02.080]   give us a business plan. Yeah, like what you might do with this, but if it's under $25,000,
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:08.400]   you know, like this looks like it. And what they're doing is they really are engaging in it at
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:12.720]   before the troubles with Apple, all of us, you know, we're just paying it. We were like, oh,
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:17.520]   it's might be unity or, or, or unreal. And then as soon as the Epic,
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:22.160]   grants came in, everyone went unreal. And then, and then when, when Epic got into the fight with
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:26.640]   Apple, everyone was like, we don't know yet. And so they really, that's why I always feel like
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:32.240]   that was such an unforced error. So you think Apple should do the same with pro pro apps on the,
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:36.880]   on the tablet on iOS, high performance apps, I would say, you know, proposed in different ways.
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:45.040]   I mean, for in science, in media, yeah, you could drive iPad sales by having those apps available
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:50.800]   that are only that are really taking full advantage of the, of the hardware, which I just don't see
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:54.640]   anything, almost anything out there pushing. I mean, LumaFusion pushes it pretty hard, you know,
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:14:00.800]   is a good example of something that is using up that iPad for all its worth. But, but there's
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:05.600]   not that many apps out there that do that. Well, the other, the other, I think the other consideration
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:09.680]   here is that a lot of the, a lot of the background information that was given in the, in the actual
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:16.240]   wearing's call had to do with not necessarily, oh, well, we're getting a lot of people switching from
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:21.600]   unprecedented year for people switching from iPhone, excuse me, Android iPhone unprecedented
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:26.560]   number of new Mac users unprecedented new sales, blah, blah, blah, less because of
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:31.120]   our products are wonderful or superior. People are getting onto it. People are really excited
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:35.200]   about it. And a lot of the stuff that's in the call actually explains that there is,
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:38.480]   there are extenuating circumstances. For instance, what Jason was saying earlier that
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:45.840]   one of the reasons for such a stellar year for Macs and iPhones is the pent up demand. There was
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:50.560]   a lot of opportunities that they missed this quarter last year because of supply constraints
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:54.080]   and not simply being able to manufacture enough them. So a lot of the people who
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:58.400]   didn't buy last year were had that money still under the mattress and were ready to buy next year.
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:04.560]   And also there's the, these, the, I think two or three times, they mentioned how well they're doing in
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:11.680]   Mexico, India, Vietnam, and a couple other countries that they typically don't really talk about.
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:16.480]   So we have a lot of people who are essentially new money coming into the iPhone market,
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.520]   not that they've never sold there before, but but now that they're really, really being,
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:24.160]   now that they're, their Apple is being more aggressive towards making sure that they're
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:28.400]   selling to everybody who wants an iPhone in the world, no matter where they are,
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:32.400]   you get a lot more people switching from Android because those are going to be certainly Android
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:37.600]   strongholds. So there's a lot of subtext here that comes, that comes down to not just
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:43.120]   the iPad needs to have more professional apps or the strategy is this or people aren't really
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:48.000]   responding to that, but a lot has to do with simply that this is the cadence of how people buy things
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.600]   and why certain, certain valves are open and certain other valves are kind of more loose and
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:16:00.000]   tight. Do we know how well the iPad does internationally? Is it a US phenomenon?
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.400]   They have said that it has done that they've seen a lot of growth with the iPad outside of the US.
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:10.080]   I think what happened is that in the US and maybe Europe, the iPad had that huge spike 2012-2013
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:14.400]   where they made a huge amount of money and everybody thought, oh, well, here we go rocket ship going
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:21.600]   up. And then it didn't. And it's only been since sort of 2019 where the sales have gone back up.
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:27.280]   And I just to put the iPad number in context, they did sell $29 billion worth of iPads in
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:36.160]   in in fiscal 22. It is essentially at the height it was in 2012-2013. It's down a couple billion
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:42.960]   from last year, which I think you could really see people buying iPads in pandemic lockdowns and
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:50.560]   things like that. But like a I know that everybody's focused on growth. I get it. But if the iPad's
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:56.320]   disappointment is that it's settled in as a $30 billion dollar Asia year business, the iPad's doing
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:00.080]   okay. It's not taken over the world. There's no doubt about it. It's not reaching the heights that
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:05.840]   the Mac has been reaching lately. And yet it has it has come from those years in the doldrums where
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:12.400]   it was down in the teens back up to around 30 billion a year. It's pretty just by Apple standards.
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:17.040]   It's kind of an okay business. But I think by most standards, it's doing pretty well.
[00:17:17.040 --> 00:17:22.880]   Yeah. Also, you really have to compare that the tone of this of this call with all the other
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:27.200]   calls that a lot of us have been reading for the past week, we can have where like you have
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:34.000]   Facebook's which is like, yeah, we lost half our value over the past year. And we're and our we're
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.920]   and basically Captain Quig is going to be chasing that white whale all the way down to the bottom
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:42.800]   of the ocean. Google saying we did well. We didn't grow as much as we wanted to. But here are reasons
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:46.000]   why the investments that we're making in the future are positive investments. We are very
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.280]   aware of the challenges that face us. And we're addressing them. Whereas Apple is we made a fortune.
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:54.560]   We would have made a little bit more of a fortune had it not been for A, B and C.
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:18:00.880]   And by the way, please, we're not going to be doing the vix this successful every quarter. I mean,
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:05.520]   that was almost a direct quote. Like, we are not going to have a record quarter every quarter.
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:12.160]   Come on. I mean, there, you know, even Lewis Hamilton sometimes doesn't win the F one. Come on.
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:16.640]   So yeah, that's so I mean, the whole upbeat tone of this thing, especially when you have
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:21.200]   lots of things to be upbeat about it really is interesting compared to every other call that
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:25.200]   we've been reading and listened to for the past week or two. Captain, by the way, it was Ahab who
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:30.480]   chased the white whale. Captain Quig was walking from the strawberry ice cream and a freezer. It
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:35.600]   was gone. It was just a peer. But it might be one of them would be a better CEO. Yes.
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:43.920]   Facebook then. I know I do charts, but I don't normally watch financial television. But right
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:47.840]   before the Apple results come out, I like to turn on CNBC and see what they're saying.
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:52.720]   And they were pulling their hair out. I mean, they're like, Oh, God, tech industry, it's destroyed.
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:56.560]   Apple's going to destroy it further. Or and what then there's the one guy who's like,
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:19:01.920]   No, I'm bullish on Apple. Apple will save us. And that guy always does that. And he's always
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:09.760]   right, at least so far. But the doom and gloom. I hadn't really realized how much financial people
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:13.680]   were like looking at the tech industry as a crater. A scooter. A smoking crater. Right.
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:18.160]   And then you come in and Apple strolls in the door. And it is not as if Apple is without blemish.
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:24.960]   They have lots of things that you can look at and be skeptical about in the like, if you analyze it,
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:29.280]   but compared to the rest of the tech industry. Oh, my goodness. Yeah.
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:35.600]   Well, yeah, Philip Elmer Dewitt was on the tweet on Sunday. And he pointed out the graph that he
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:43.120]   had borrowed from the Wall Street Journal that shows how the tech industry has done in the last
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:49.040]   month. And the meta is at the bottom there. Look at that. Look at that drop right there.
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:55.680]   Amazon next step. Look at that drop right there. Alphabet. And I look at Apple. Hey, wait a minute.
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:20:00.480]   But and I pointed out, and you know, it's funny. The market has some investors have so little
[00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:06.720]   memory. A lot of this drop was because of a big spike in COVID. And we went back and looked at
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:12.080]   share prices pre COVID. And today, in almost every respect, all the tech companies are up
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:19.600]   versus January 2020. So it really was that they just had an onion and you brought this up earlier,
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:26.000]   Jason, they had a big bump in during COVID. And now they're coming off of that a little bit.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.880]   And there's some shrinkage. And if you're focused on growth, it's hard, right? Like they, okay,
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:35.120]   they have a term and the boy, all this jargon that I've gotten to learn covering this. It's
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:39.200]   called the tough compare, tough compare. But what does it mean? What it means is if you're focused
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:43.120]   on growth and you're looking at year over year, what did they do in the year ago, go quarter versus
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:47.200]   now? And then you have a big COVID bump where people are like buying laptops because they have
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:51.840]   to work at home and they're buying iPads and for their kid for school and all that stuff. Well,
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:56.320]   that's great, right? The sales go way up. But in the back of your mind, if you're a leuke
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:00.720]   Meister and Tim Cook, you're thinking, how are we going to beat this next year?
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:05.120]   Exactly. When I sold all these this year. And that's, I think maybe the real levitation that
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:10.480]   Apple's done is they managed to sort of maintain up there because yeah, it's just the year over
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:15.280]   year compare, if you have a big spike, you're going to take it in the chin the next year because
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:19.440]   you can't remember hard to match. This is the mismatch between investors, priorities,
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:22.400]   and what should be a company's priorities. Investors only care about how they're
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:28.960]   stocked it over the last quarter. Companies raked in trillions of dollars in windfall profits
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:34.160]   over the last two years, all of them. And I think to some degree companies would like to pretend
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:38.160]   that didn't happen because they don't really want people to think about how much money they
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:42.560]   made while the rest of us were suffering. Alex? Well, I think that the other thing is, is that
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:48.640]   Apple, what Apple's done is almost impossible. Like, and being able to build a vertical market
[00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:54.080]   at this level of your phone and your wearables and everything all integrated together,
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:22:00.320]   POS and the hardware and all those other bits and pieces. It's an almost impossible thing to do,
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:04.400]   but once you get to the other side, it's almost impossible to compete with because you have,
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:13.040]   we're looking at good Mac numbers, but they're still 10% of the market. They have 90% in front of
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:16.880]   them to take. Well, that was another question I was asking on Sunday was,
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:22.560]   has Apple saturated the market? And everybody said, no, God, no, not only.
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:26.880]   Not only. But maybe in the US, but internationally, there's a lot of growth potentially.
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:31.520]   Well, but also, but also, they haven't even saturated in the accessories.
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:35.680]   You know, like, you know, home, home kit is a good example. Home kit is a disaster. If Apple
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:40.080]   decided that they just gave up on this home kit program and said, we're just going to make
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:46.640]   a thermostat a lock of a outlet of, they would, they would double that little, they would have a
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:50.720]   little sliver in there that's 10% of the revenue. That's all those things. And at some point,
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:54.640]   I think you're just going to give up because the, what happened, the industry, the home
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:59.680]   automation industry just won't commit to Apple. And so at some point, Apple has to just say, well,
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:03.520]   you know, we're just going to have to do it ourselves. And if they do that and they do those
[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:05.760]   five things, those five things are like 90% of the market, right?
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:10.080]   I understand that statement. What do you mean they won't commit to Apple?
[00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:15.040]   So they're doing home kit, but they're not doing exclusively home kit. They want to,
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:18.720]   they want to be in Zigmi or something else. And so they have all the stuff and they have all the
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:22.880]   stuff. You know what, the home, home automation is a mess. It's still on it.
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:26.480]   But it's a mess. And there's a whole bunch of us like me that are just sitting on the outside
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:29.680]   waiting for Apple to start releasing products. Because the thing is, is that it's like, it's
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:34.160]   never really going to, you just open up the stuff that's all I buy home kit stuff as a test and it
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:39.280]   never really works. And it just, and it's supposed to just work and it never does. And Apple, you know,
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:43.840]   you know, was heavy handed at the very beginning. People didn't commit to it. Apple then loosened
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:47.280]   it up and now now there's more things, but none of them work. Apple made it very expensive.
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:51.760]   Whatever first this is, theoretically, I think basically day one of matter.
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:56.560]   And I think I think with the next OS updates, you're going to see a lot of this and a lot of
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:59.920]   this home stuff is going to resolve because they all put down there. I mean, it was years
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:03.360]   ago. It was like three years ago, they put down their swords and said, we're going to stop fighting.
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:06.640]   We're going to make one standard. Now they have to roll it out and that's going to be a little
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:12.080]   painful. But I feel like that war is already over and starting. Well, I will say, we're not going
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:17.920]   to have to deal with it. And then that absolutely would have been death if if if everybody started
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:21.440]   saying we're going to make this light bulb that works great with Google. And then we have another
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:25.600]   light bubble works great with Apple that how about people who don't necessarily are not willing to
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:30.320]   go all in on one platform, you should be able to buy one light bulb. And actually, I will I will
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:35.440]   lay most of the blame at Apple's feet on this one because I have a I have a mixed hardware here in
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:39.680]   the house. I do have some home kits. Some I do have apples that work with home kit. I have other
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:44.720]   I've Google stuff. I've got Nest stuff. Excuse me, I've got Phillips Hugh stuff and hubs.
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:49.200]   The only one that gets screwed up is home kit. And that's not everyone else's responsibility.
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:54.160]   That's Apple's responsibility. Well, again, again, there's a I would argue that there's an awful lot
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:59.600]   of billions worth of cash of people who would just buy from Apple if Apple delivered it. Like,
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:02.480]   you know, like they would just be like, I don't care if it works with everything else. All I
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:06.400]   wanted to do was work with my Mac. Don't you have a problem because there are a lot of people who
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:12.160]   tried over the last decade home automation and it ended up being janky didn't work so well. It was
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:17.200]   it was an interoperable. And so I think there's a huge I think the mass of people who've tried
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:21.600]   it or just said, I'm not going to do that again. Do you think they'll come back if somebody came
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:26.000]   along and made it easy and if Apple did it, Apple did it? Yeah, like like it's like, I don't
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.720]   think we'll see. We'll see you matter of work. I'm so beaten up by it. Yeah, I get what Alex is
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:34.160]   saying about like our one Apple do Apple's not going to make every home product you want. They
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:37.600]   they seem to just have decided they're not going to but what you're going to get is
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:42.480]   under the auspices of Apple and Google and Microsoft, you're going to get this matter stuff
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:47.760]   where Apple and it's going to be in the Apple store and Apple's going to say, this is our blessed
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:54.000]   way. We do this now, but it's not if you're looking for Apple to make a router and a lock and
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.200]   they're not going to do it. Amazon's going to affect ring just announced they're doing car alarms now.
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:06.560]   This is Amazon is exactly the kind of company that's willing to make a lot of cheap and consumer
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:12.400]   products. And if it's a matter of device, it won't be walled off from people who are using the Google
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:18.720]   Assistant or using HomeKit. And I just think if it doesn't work, I think Apple will have to do it.
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:24.800]   I've been trying to automate. I've been playing with automation in my house for 20 years.
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:31.760]   It's been a disaster for two decades. Like it is just unmitigated disaster.
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:34.640]   I'm going to push back a little bit because you're looking for Apple to save you and the
[00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:40.160]   home app has been terrible for years and it's only now slightly less terrible. Although automation
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:44.720]   in the home app is still kind of a disaster. So I don't I mean Apple needs to get its own house
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:50.480]   in order first, right? Like I need to properly automate things in the home app and they just
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:55.680]   haven't done like there's a weird implementation of shortcuts in there except only it's very limited
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:27:00.400]   and it doesn't work right. And I don't know. Apple has a lot of work to do with what they've got to
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:04.320]   make it better. They only get away with that because everybody else is awful as well.
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:12.560]   It helps. I would say I would say less awful, but yeah. I have some questions about this market.
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:18.480]   And you know, they're just channeling Steve Jobs who said you got to say no to almost everything.
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.440]   Right? Apple's gotten a little looser on that. Look at all the different iPads,
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:27.840]   excuse. But I think there's 48 somebody counted 48 excuse now. Yeah. I want to take a little
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:31.520]   break. We'll come back. I want to talk about the future too because Apple was not quite so
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:42.400]   sanguine about the next quarter also services. But first, a word from our sponsor. Are you hiring?

[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:09.680]   this was one of the shining stars in apples quarterly results. I mean, it's not like
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:15.040]   they're down a lot, but is there something you worry about down down sequentially still up year
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:22.240]   over year. This is the one case where I think apples excuse that they are getting hammered by
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:28.880]   foreign exchange is actually actually accurate. If you do the math, like just having a strong dollar,
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:34.240]   you know, maybe you used to take in 650 a month from Apple TV subscriptions in the UK.
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:38.640]   And without changing the price, and they did change the price, they just raised the price.
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:43.840]   Yeah, I just got my email there bumping me up three bucks for my one. Yeah. Well, without changing
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:51.680]   the price that 650 or whatever in the UK when you launched. Now you're bringing in like 550 or 560.
[00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:55.360]   And that that is happening all over the world everywhere. But the US is that the
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:31:01.200]   just the movement of the dollar against all the other currencies means that all that services
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:07.600]   revenue is devalued. They said that if you calculate their services revenue in local currency,
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:11.920]   rather than taking the hit and converting it back to the dollar, they were up double digits.
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:15.520]   Oh, that's interesting. So I think that this is one of those cases, but
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:20.720]   and they can't raise prices, you know, too fast or they're going to scare people off.
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:25.440]   Right, but they did raise prices on TV and they raised it in music, but they blame the record
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:31.680]   companies for that. But they did raise it in TV. I think it's interesting also that what we've seen
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:35.840]   outside of the US and for everybody who watches and listens to this show outside of the US, I know
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:40.640]   we're very US-centric because we're here, but Apple's been re-pricing their products
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:48.560]   and new products that come out get priced way higher everywhere but the US. So we see these new
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:53.120]   products come out from Apple and we're like, oh, that new iPad, it's the same price as the,
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:56.880]   you know, as the time before, that new iPhone is the same price as the time before,
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:01.280]   not overseas, it's not like in other countries, they are ratcheting up the price of cars.
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:04.800]   I've actually heard people complaining about that a lot. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:10.080]   How expensive an iPhone has gotten. So maybe that is going to, that might hurt them.
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:15.280]   It might have yet they claim that they get so many people as any mentioned in so many people who
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:19.920]   are new to iPhone or new to iPad. So I think that they're still, you know, they're walking a line
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:24.480]   there where they want to have people buy their products and come to the product line, but at the
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:30.800]   same time, the strong dollar does hurt them. You know, to the tune of, they keep saying, you know,
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:36.080]   four or five billion dollars a quarter that is just revenue that they would not, you know,
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:40.720]   that they can't really account for in US dollars because the dollar is so strong.
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:48.480]   Yeah. Yeah. Let's continue on looking at the colorful charts.
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:56.640]   The lovely colorful charts, wearables. Pretty good. Yeah. Now that's the home.
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:02.240]   New AirPods and a new Apple watch. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that was up a little bit.
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:07.680]   You're over your revenue up 10% after a bad quarter, a last quarter.
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:14.000]   Percentage revenue by product line, the iPhone is. Remember, the iPhone is important.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:19.440]   It's really important. In fact, it's more. It's actually, it's less important than it has
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:25.280]   been, right? It's that. Well, it's like smaller. Yeah. Yeah. But that is a very
[00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:31.040]   seasonal thing. If you look at the spike there where the iPhone is like next quarter, the holiday
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:35.600]   quarter, which is also the first full quarter that the new iPhone says, it will be more like
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:40.640]   six quarters. Yeah. It'll be more like 55 or 60% of Apple's revenue, whereas this time it was down
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:46.560]   in the 47, 48% range. But it is interesting. Yeah. It is interesting that services have become the
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:52.240]   second most second biggest revenue producer. Yeah. That's true. It is almost free money
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:55.600]   compared to hardware. Right. Oh, the mark that and the thing that it doesn't,
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:34:02.480]   this is an amazing thing about it. We're looking at revenue, right? We're looking at pure revenue.
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:08.960]   One of the things they mention is they mention the margin, the profit margin on this, and the
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:15.120]   profit margin on that services revenue is enormous. They make so much profit on every dollar that
[00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:20.880]   comes in through services versus with hardware where they have to build the hardware and ship
[00:34:20.880 --> 00:34:25.360]   the hardware and deliver the hardware and maybe repair the hardware. The services, it's just sort
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:31.760]   of like free money. It's not quite free money, but it's real. It's rent seeking as many have
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:36.960]   pointed out. Well, they're, you know, they do have to actually like pay the musical artists or they
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:41.840]   have to make those most of us from the app stores and all that. Most of us from the app store.
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:45.760]   But on the app store, yeah, that is just cash to the bottom line.
[00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:51.120]   Pure money. They were also quick to point out how their growth in not just having people
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:55.360]   who are having services account accounts, but number of paid accounts. They're saying there
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:35:01.040]   was another record year for like actual paid numbers, more than 900 million paid subscriptions
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:05.760]   across the services on our platform up more than 155 million during the last 12 months alone
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:08.880]   and double what we had just three years ago. Though I don't know that that was another one
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:14.320]   where I kind of had a question mark on where does that include people who accepted your offer of
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:22.000]   a paid bundle so that now instead of paying like 10 bucks for 20 bucks, I was spending like 30 bucks
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.560]   for two subscriptions. Now they're spending 30 bucks for four subscriptions and that accounts
[00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:29.520]   for two more paid subscriptions per user. I don't know.
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:39.520]   So basically a record quarter, we knew it would be, but they said the future is not so bright.
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:47.600]   Well, and I think they will sandbag apples. They always sandbag.
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:51.760]   They have sandbag as much as they used to. They don't. They used to.
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:56.400]   They were told not to. They were told not to. Like they were sandbagging and I think it was the SEC.
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:00.720]   You can't say that much. Because their estimates were
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:05.280]   painfully low. Yeah. So.
[00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:12.640]   Yeah. So they warned that there were still going to be issues from foreign exchange that are going
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:18.480]   to hit them and that they expected to decelerate another great financial quarter,
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:21.840]   financial word that they like to throw out there decelerate their growth.
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:27.760]   So that means grow, but not buy as much. And we don't know what that means, but what that
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:33.440]   means is that it will be less than whatever 8% growth next quarter. Now again,
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:37.440]   holiday quarter is traditionally apples biggest. And yes, that means last year's
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:41.120]   holiday quarter was the biggest apple quarter ever by far.
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:46.640]   What is unclear is do they think they're going to beat it? Do they think they're going to come
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:51.760]   in under it? That they didn't say all they said because everybody and especially Apple has used
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:55.600]   COVID as an excuse now where they're like, well, we live in times of uncertainty. So we're not going
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:59.360]   to give a forecast. They used to, they used to sandbag their forecast and then they were told
[00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:03.200]   they needed to be more realistic with their forecast and they got more realistic. But the moment
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:08.720]   that they could just not do a forecast, they stopped. So they, they, so all we know is they
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:15.040]   think that they will grow less than 8% next quarter year over year. And that could be 7% or
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:18.000]   2% or minus 10% who knows.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:24.880]   Elon has now announced its $8 a month to keep your blue check, by the way. That, that just
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:27.840]   just worth it. That just out. And I have canceled my
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:31.120]   is it a official subscription? Yeah, it's officially just tweeted it.
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:39.760]   Twitter's current lords in peasants system for who has and doesn't have a blue check mark is BS.
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:44.240]   Actually, there was a reason for it. But okay, power to the people.
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:50.400]   The reason was Tony LaRusa was so mad that he sued Twitter because there was a guy impersonating
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:54.320]   him. And Twitter's response says, well, we'll give people who really are who they say they are,
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:59.680]   a blue check mark. So it wasn't about lords and peasants. And now it is about lords and peasants,
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:04.160]   by the way, because it's about people who could spend $96 a year for a blue check mark. So
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:07.040]   Elon, it's actually the opposite what you just did. But okay.
[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:14.640]   I know this is going to be a side thing, but this is just like keep it being reminded of that scene
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:20.160]   in in the comedy bananas where the revolutionary finally, like is the president that makes his
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:26.960]   first proclamations and they're all just insane. Like underwear will be changed six times a day.
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:30.560]   All underwear must be worn on the outside so that we can check.
[00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:37.280]   Anyone who's 28 years old is now 20 years old. And also says you'll get priority and replies.
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:42.160]   I don't know what that means. Mention and search, which is essential to defeat spam and scam.
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:48.320]   Oh, I guess maybe you won't be downgraded because you might be spammer scam ability to post long
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:55.840]   video and audio half as many ads and paywall bypass for publishers willing to work with this,
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:59.760]   which is interesting because publishers have just mentioned, including nine to five,
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:04.240]   that they are no longer going to be paid and there will no longer be free access.
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:10.080]   So anyway, I just thought it update you and just let me tell you how easy it is.
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:14.880]   Turn off your Twitter blue subscription. I had the I was grandfather in it to 99.
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:18.400]   I just went in my Apple subscriptions. Thank you, Apple and turned it off.
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:28.560]   Back to next quarter. Are they sandbagging? No.
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:33.600]   No, I think that they it's reasonable for them to say.
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:37.520]   They don't want to tell us. They don't want to tell us. And I think, you know, here's,
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:41.600]   here's what I think who nobody knows. But my guess is they're going to be like, well,
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:47.600]   deceleration, blah, blah, blah. And then when they post a 2% gain, which means that it'll be
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:54.320]   their record quarter of all time, they'll be able to say, well, say, look, look, I know it's only 2%,
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:40:00.960]   but we told you and record and they'll just kind of skate. That's my guess. Maybe I'll be proven
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:05.760]   wrong. One of these days, they're not going to levitate for a quarter, but I don't know. I,
[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:11.120]   they have done it in so many successive quarters that I got to think that it's going to happen
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:14.560]   again. And they're going to post another record quarter, but maybe only buy a little bit and not
[00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:21.760]   buy a lot. Well, of course, we'll find out in three months. Yeah, check back in. I have more
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:27.360]   charts. I am very happy that the Mac does well. I understand why the iPads, you know, just
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:30.960]   basically flat line humming along. We should probably say it's a flat line. That sounds like
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:40.640]   it's dead. I think Apple could change that next year. Important note, Mark Gurman and Tim Cook at
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:46.560]   the analyst call said, what did Tim say? He said, we've got all the products we're going to have.
[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:50.720]   He said, we love our retail people and we are totally set with what we're going to have in
[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:55.680]   stores for the holiday season, like totally set. Totally set. And then also they said,
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:41:00.640]   next quarter, you know, remember, we had the MacBook Pro launch last year. And so it's going
[00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:05.600]   to be a tough compare. And the implication there is, well, we're not doing a MacBook Pro launch this
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:09.360]   year. So tough compare time. So man, then Mark Gurman came out and said, yeah, it's going to be
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:14.080]   next year before we get that Mac mini and MacBook Pro update that we thought might happen this month.
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:18.240]   That also may mean that they think that they're going to do okay without those products,
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:25.200]   this quarter. So why not put them in the next quarter? That means that they're fairly confident
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:29.680]   that this is going to be a good quarter for them from what they already have in the pipe.
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:36.080]   They also say right at the top that they don't expect supply constraints to affect their future
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:39.920]   business that they are able to whatever the problems were last year, they're kind of
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:44.880]   going to top them. So they removed that as an excuse for bad performance for the next quarter.
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:49.440]   The old legacy nodes, another one of those things that the term that I didn't know before,
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:54.640]   the idea that basically there was these chip shortages all over the world with like Bluetooth
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:42:00.480]   chips and other stuff that was like old tech, but hard to come by. And they said, it's not a
[00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:04.960]   problem anymore. Now they did say some of that stuff is more expensive than it used to be.
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:10.640]   But so it may not clear for everybody, but it's clear like for Apple for Apple's purposes,
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:14.880]   they can get everything they want, even if they have to pay a little more for it. But that will
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:20.640]   allow them to fill all orders that come in. And that's a big step for them because I think
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:24.720]   you know Tim Cook has hated that, right? You know Tim Cook hates it. When somebody says,
[00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:29.120]   I want to give you my money and Apple's like, oh, we can't give you a product for six weeks. He
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:34.160]   wants to hand them that product right then. That's his whole thing. So they seem to be back and
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:39.360]   balanced there. And by all accounts, it looks like they're going to become more and more vertically
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:43.040]   integrated that way. I mean, they're, you know, the M1 is the beginning, but they've made mention
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:47.600]   of it before, like what's slowing us down is all these external chips. So they, you know,
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:51.680]   I think that they're going to continue to fuse more of those things, maybe not on the chip,
[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:54.640]   but it sounds like they're going to keep on customizing those until they're the only
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:59.280]   customer for the chips that they use. Yeah, iPhone on a chip.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:06.960]   Yeah. So TSMC, you know, we talk a lot about how Apple locked in their five nanometer process and
[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:12.160]   actually TSMC wants more for three nanometer. They already announced that. But those legacy
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:16.880]   notes, some of them are 16 nanometer there. And TSMC doesn't make all of them. So a lot of this
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:23.680]   comes about, about by paying companies to big build plants to make this, you know, accelerometer chip
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:29.040]   or whatever. Yeah, or Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. I mean, this is why there are lots of cars that are not
[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:34.080]   available or weren't available or other like gadgets where you're like, why is this even a thing?
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:37.760]   And the answer is there's a chip in there. Try to get a Raspberry Pi.
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:42.880]   Well, yeah, try to get a Raspberry Pi is a good example. Panic has their little play date game
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:48.240]   thing, which is really great. But they had to like slipstream in a different processor because
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:53.280]   the pro the low, you know, not particularly cutting edge processor that they were using
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:44:00.000]   just basically went out of availability for a year. And they're like, well, what do we do? And it's
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.040]   not cutting edge at all. But it's one of these legacy nodes that's being used for other stuff.
[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:08.000]   So that seems to be clearing up now, which is good news for all of us who are like, I want to buy
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.960]   a Raspberry Pi or like that thing that I talked about last week, some embedded system that's got a
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:18.160]   little Raspberry Pi drop, you know, driving it. And you for the last year, you go on these websites
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:22.640]   like here's an incredibly cool thing you can build with a Raspberry Pi. Step one, do you already have
[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:28.080]   a Raspberry Pi? Otherwise come back in a year or two because we haven't been able to buy them.
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:36.800]   I really enjoyed on the, you probably saw this on the Twitter forums at Twitter. Community,
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:42.000]   somebody said, what the hell was that thing Jason talked about? And then what was the thing
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:50.640]   that Alex, they didn't understand. But Chul, Petules fans, as I know, I'm about the opposite
[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:55.600]   of a tech nerd. But is it bad that I have no idea what Jason's pick of the week was or what it does?
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:45:01.920]   Yeah, well, let me give you the elevator pitch. It's a little computer and a screen that is
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:06.000]   so little power you could run on a battery and you can program it to show whatever you want.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.320]   Yeah, kind of a number of us jumped in to try to explain. I don't know if Julie
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:16.560]   Ben was satisfied. And then she said, because then along came Alex's picks, which mystified me
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:23.680]   even further. Andy, you're letting us down. Oh, you're
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:27.840]   I don't remember what I was talking about. Your pick was the thing that lets you see what the shots
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:34.320]   going to look like through your eye. Yeah, which is what you can only somebody who's making a movie
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:40.560]   like a film. I feel like that's my role here is to provide. I am not complaining on either
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:47.120]   account. I thought it was hysterical, but that's a fact I celebrate it. That's right. Look at the
[00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:53.200]   weather. You see, it's raining. And we know it's preview lens preview is all it is. Yeah,
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:58.800]   lens preview for. And I know I never want you guys to be less than the ultimate geeks that you
[00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:05.120]   are going to be nerdy. That's the future. This show. I love that one of the nerdiest people I know,
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:08.640]   Andy and I co was not the one called out there. That is amazing. Good job.
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:15.440]   Well, I'm the one you all would like to have a tight Dr. Pepper with. I, you know, I'm
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:19.360]   just sit around the old cracker bowel and talk about property tax. And I hope I can have your
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:24.560]   support in November. I think actually one one year is a pick of the week was in fact,
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:32.160]   Mexican Coca Cola. Love it. So there you go. Didn't didn't result in the sponsorship. But
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:38.320]   okay, no, we tried. You know, it is hard to make 50% of the shots. It's gonna be it's actually
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:42.640]   gonna get harder and harder, I think for us to make money as a as podcasters. This is one of the
[00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:47.840]   things that we talked about on the gray matter podcast with Michael Krasney. The future is not
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:52.720]   right for podcasting. Now Amazon has announced. And actually this hurts Apple too. I think a
[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:58.240]   little bit. If you are an Amazon Prime subscriber, you will have the full music catalog of 100 million
[00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:06.160]   songs available to you plus add free podcasts. Now this is kind of like Apple's five buck
[00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:14.160]   iTunes thing, right? Because you can't say play a particular song. You're gonna get shuffles and
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:20.320]   stuff. But I bet they know that most people that's that's fine. Right? I don't that often ask for
[00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:23.680]   a particular is it? Well, maybe it isn't for you. I thought,
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:30.880]   the thing the thing the thing is the compelling power of I want exactly what I want. And I wanted
[00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:36.000]   for free as an entitlement never underestimate the power of that there are people who are saying,
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:42.720]   well, how about if we charge you less for Netflix, but you get ads? No, no, I should be able to share.
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:46.400]   My class reading should be all people who share the same network,
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:51.600]   network passwords, those passwords, you bastards trying to. Yeah. So I think that people will
[00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:57.680]   gravitate towards free. They might gravitate towards piracy as well. For people, it's not the
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:03.040]   the ease at which it is possible to find that thing that you want to find for free without DRM
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:07.360]   is the bar is becoming lower and lower and lower. And I think that a lot of these services are
[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:12.320]   going to have to respond to that. But yeah, it's this but free content is becoming table stakes. Now,
[00:48:12.320 --> 00:48:15.760]   if you want to if you want people to get on board, you're going to have to give them stuff for free.
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:20.000]   And then you're kind of have to have to cout out of them and give it to them in a way in which
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.840]   they are demanding it because it may be right, maybe wrong, but that's the that's the market that's
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:29.840]   okay. So you can ask for an artist, but it'll shuffle play the artist or an album, but it'll
[00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:35.360]   shuffle play it. You can't listen to the album. Artists must hate this in order. You can have a
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:41.120]   playlist you can ask for. You can have personalized playlists. It's actually pretty much everything
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:47.280]   except for I want this particular song. I think it probably depends how you're listening. But
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:53.520]   remember, if you're you're using an Amazon Echo to ask for this stuff. Yeah. Yeah. But a lot of the
[00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:59.440]   market has changed not to I mean, obviously, people aren't buying tracks anymore. But a lot of the
[00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:04.800]   marketing has changed to people don't listen to certain albums. They listen to playlists. And they
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:09.280]   often listen to them through smart assistance. So that they're saying, give me the the the the
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:13.840]   flash funky 80s playlist and the songs that are in there are going to get the aren't get the play.
[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:19.040]   So it's not so much here is an individual track that got got a lot of attention is and become the
[00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:25.120]   hot track of the summer is that these thanks to marketing, thanks to ad dollars, these tracks that
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:29.520]   they want to promote got into popular playlists that are being promoted that are at the very,
[00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:33.680]   very top of the service for people who are getting this thing for free and people who are just asking
[00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:37.920]   for I don't care what you play me just play me songs that are like this through their smart
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:43.680]   speakers. It's another step into turning music into wallpaper. And I suspect people like you Alex who
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:50.640]   are more discriminating you'll buy Apple music and continue to have I have I have Apple and Spotify.
[00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:57.120]   Yeah, so so and I'm and and I yeah, I can't imagine really spending a lot of time listening music that
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:50:01.120]   I didn't choose. Well, you choose it. I'm sure there's people out there. Just say I want to hear the
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:05.920]   play the latest Taylor Swift album and it will play it out of order, you know, in shuffle. So it's not
[00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:11.120]   like you're not choosing it would be like hell for me. Yeah, so that's what I thought. Yeah, it's not
[00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:15.440]   only that I want to listen to the music I want to listen to this song exactly after this song after
[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:20.640]   this song. Yeah, you know, I have I have that way. I have like 80 playlist. Thanks music director.
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:25.840]   But you can make a playlist and you can say I want to play my playlist. Look at this is basically
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:31.280]   the music catalog of Apple music or Spotify without any fee. You're already paying the Amazon Prime
[00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:37.440]   fee that sure. I just want to use it doesn't appeal doesn't play anything to me. I think I'm
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:42.000]   a happy Amazon Prime. I get I take advantage of Amazon Prime return my order something which is
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:49.120]   almost daily. So I'm fine with. Yeah, this is another big step killing RSS podcasts the stuff we do
[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:52.960]   independent podcast networks because they're going to offer ad free versions from CNN and
[00:50:52.960 --> 00:51:00.080]   NPR, the New York Times ESPN and they own wonder. So all the wonder podcasts and and basically those
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:07.600]   podcasts are pull off RSS and they're ad free. And I just I know this is kind of inside baseball.
[00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:12.480]   But Jason, you do a lot of ad supported podcasts. I feel like sure this is tough for us because now
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:17.520]   they're getting us on both sides. They're making a hardest for harder for us to sell ads because
[00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:21.520]   they're pulling these all in house and they're selling the ads with lots more demographic
[00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:28.800]   information, lots more, you know, tracking or hey, don't have any ads at all. And it's hard to
[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:35.040]   compete against. I mean, you can't listen to Twit without ads on Amazon, but maybe it's it's
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:40.640]   it's tricky too because you're talking about it's similar to that that Elon Musk statement about
[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:44.960]   we're gonna we're gonna give this money back to the creators and like, no, you're not you're
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:48.560]   gonna keep it for yourself, right? That's the question is what's the strategy? And if it's a
[00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:53.920]   I think the dream of everybody with these podcast things is that they eventually want to be like
[00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:59.280]   YouTube or TikTok where they have a bunch of creators and the money goes to them and then they
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:05.120]   are kind enough to give some of the money to the creators. And anybody who's worked under that
[00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:10.640]   regime will tell you is it's not so great. That's why YouTube creators have patreons because
[00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:15.200]   the YouTube money is not good enough. And it doesn't work that well. And the nice thing about
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:20.720]   podcasts up to now has been we get to have some control and can set it up and say no, no, no, no,
[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:25.840]   we'll take care of this. And big companies like no, we want to be the middleman for you. And it's
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:30.240]   like we don't want you. We go away. We don't want you. But if that's where the listeners are,
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:34.800]   you can't tell them to go away. So it's a we'll see how they do. I mean, people say a lot. Big
[00:52:34.800 --> 00:52:39.840]   companies do a lot of declarations about how they're gonna change podcasting and they haven't done
[00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:43.680]   it yet. But Spotify is the one that's had the most, I think success. A lot of people are listening
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:49.360]   on Spotify. Yeah. Well, if you want to hear Rogan, you got to and yeah, and there's people are in
[00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:54.160]   that app, right? And I think that that there's some some sort of I don't want to say laziness,
[00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:58.960]   but let's say inertia, where it's like we are already in Spotify. And now you and there's a
[00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:02.800]   podcast and you listen to it and suddenly, I mean, you surely have seen it and we've seen it. The
[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:08.080]   number of the percentage of our listeners across various podcasts listing in Spotify,
[00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:14.000]   it's not huge for our nerdy tech podcasts. But even there, it keeps going up like it keeps going
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:18.800]   up. It works. Yeah. This is the principle of good enough. It's like there, there's so little
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:22.320]   difference between streaming music services at this point. You can and you can say that way,
[00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:26.960]   this one is spatial audio. This one has high resolution music, but for the core feature that
[00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:32.880]   people want, like launch app here music, there's so little difference between the three that whatever,
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:37.840]   which everyone got their loyalty earlier enough, there is, yet, as Jason says, the inertia,
[00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:42.160]   there's not enough going on in a competing service from Spotify that would make you switch from
[00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:47.360]   Spotify to something else. And even though I do pretend I do prefer Spotify's overall interface
[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:52.400]   to Apple music and pretty much everything else. But again, a lot of it is just that it's good
[00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:56.800]   enough. It gives you there's there's such a little differentiation between them. That's hard to
[00:53:56.800 --> 00:54:02.080]   really get people to say, you know what, I'm ditching this, I'm going for that. It's going to be a
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:07.200]   it's an interesting world where you these silos are just it's such a strong economic driver. Look at
[00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:12.720]   Apple. It's just there's so much incentive for a company to do this. And that's just the way it's
[00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:19.520]   way it's headed. It's a little scary. And I I feel bad screw podcasts, who cares? But I feel bad for
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:25.520]   musicians, because I really feel like what music is being turned into wallpaper for a whole generation
[00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:28.800]   is just, it doesn't matter what you're listening to. It's just music. It's in the
[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:32.160]   background. It's like being in a Vegas casino. It's just a bunch of songs.
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:38.240]   But I will say one thing it's nice that it's nice that there are so many different ways to
[00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:42.320]   discover music right now. There's so many different ways for for music to come to people's attention
[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:49.760]   and as soon as like as soon as you hear that, wow, there is this artist named Lizo. I don't
[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:53.760]   know. Some people are kind of upset because she was playing a flute. Wow, there's a hip and I wonder
[00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:58.560]   what this I wonder what this Lizo person is like. And then seconds later, you can you can be listening
[00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:03.200]   to her entire catalog and suddenly become a big fan of hers without to rest before it would have
[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:06.640]   been. I don't know if I want to go to a record store. I don't know if I want to spend 10 bucks
[00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:13.760]   taking a flutter on a CD. I may or may not like it. It's maybe I hope it balances out in terms of
[00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:18.880]   in terms of bringing in new fans and new. I'll tell you one thing. I have of course purchased the
[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:27.200]   entire Lizo catalog, but I bought it again so I could play it in Beat Saber. And that is a lot
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:36.800]   of fun in Beat Saber to play Lizo. I mean, you know, I look at the just the sheer volume or
[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:42.800]   breadth of understanding my kids have of music because they don't have to buy it. So, you know,
[00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:47.760]   the thing is, is that my daughter, she can play you for hours. She can play you big bands. She loves
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:52.880]   big bands. So she's 13 years old. Awesome. And she and she lists, but what she does is she listens
[00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:56.800]   to a song that she knows. And then she says, and then she just lets it keep playing. And then she
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:56:01.760]   starts favoriting the ones that she likes. And she's got to weigh away about her. And she knows all
[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:06.160]   of these songs that I don't know anything about. And because my wife and I are pretty
[00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:11.200]   eclectic. And when it comes to music, they just have gone everywhere. And they have, you know,
[00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:17.520]   these obscure 70s and 60s and, you know, 30s is a big improvement. And it's all over the place.
[00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:21.520]   I couldn't, you know, your friends, you know, like I grew up listening to what my cousins were.
[00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:25.680]   Was on the radio. Right. No, it was on the radio. And and and she has this incredibly,
[00:56:25.680 --> 00:56:32.400]   and my son as well, but both of them have an incredibly wide range and deep range of knowledge
[00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:37.120]   because they didn't have to go out and buy something every single time. And because they didn't have
[00:56:37.120 --> 00:56:41.360]   to wait for the radio, I think there's a lot of artists that would have been more successful had
[00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:45.680]   the had we not been in such a vertical radio market. And I used to work in that market. There were
[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:50.240]   tons. I have this maybe playlist called Lost Alt, which is Lost Alternative that I have in my
[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:55.280]   thing, which is bands that never made it. And I was a music director and I saw the songs come through,
[00:56:55.280 --> 00:57:00.320]   you know, and and they just didn't, you know, they they opened, they released on the same week as
[00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:04.640]   Oxfung Baby, or they released on the hand and just they just they never made it, you know,
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:07.520]   I think there was there was no reason for that other than just luck.
[00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:11.200]   I think there's a myth in the back of people's heads that, oh, the recorded music,
[00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:16.000]   the musicians who have labels are the best musicians. And it isn't that at all.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:20.160]   It's whatever the record label thought they could successfully package that, you know, air
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:25.120]   supply of all things air supplies come into the casino up here. I said, big billboards say,
[00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:31.360]   you know, tickets on sale. Now for their April appearance. And I thought air supply, really? And
[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:35.920]   then so I said, well, let me listen to an air supply song. I remember these songs. And it's just
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:41.760]   completely pabble them. It's terrible. So some record executive somewhere, it's not that they were,
[00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:46.480]   oh, they're so great. I can't wait to sign them. They're going to be huge. Some record executive,
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:51.120]   somewhere packaged it. That's all. Well, some in some cases, I mean, many cases,
[00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:56.080]   A&R when I was in Sony, A&R was a big deal. And they were pretty, you basically, someone took on
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:58:00.080]   an artist and, you know, there were definitely people who are packaging them, but there was a
[00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:03.760]   lot of them. That's what music was better in the 70s. It's not that way anymore. I wasn't a
[00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:12.160]   music director in the 70s. Oh, yeah. So the 90s, 90s. But the, but they would grab onto an artist,
[00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:17.680]   and then they were kind of championing that artist within the label of, of, I think this is, I,
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:21.440]   you know, I think, I remember for me when I was there, it was like Pearl Jam, like someone found,
[00:58:21.440 --> 00:58:26.240]   you know, like we're going to, that someone had to get Pearl Jam signed, you know, like from,
[00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:28.400]   from where they were. Well, how do you explain air supply?
[00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:32.880]   No, no, no. I think that the 70s were a weird time. I mean, it was like,
[00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:40.320]   it was the carpenters and the carpenters in air supply. I feel like even, like even today,
[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:45.920]   record labels look, well, what's their, you know, how good looking are they? Are they sexy?
[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:49.200]   You think we'd get teenage girls coming out to see the concerts?
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:54.000]   Okay. Now let's send it to a studio in Norway and turn that music into gold.
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.160]   And I feel like there's a lot of sweet, sweet and sorry.
[00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:57.760]   Norway. Nothing.
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:58:58.640]   Weird.
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:03.120]   Nothing good ever came out of Norway. No, there's a whole, that's what, there's a whole thing,
[00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:06.880]   a Swedish like factory. It's off. It all, it all came from ABBA.
[00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:08.160]   From ABBA. Yeah.
[00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:11.680]   And, and so they produced it and there's this cottage industry there where they
[00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:15.280]   know Britney Spears happened. Britney Spears.
[00:59:15.280 --> 00:59:15.760]   Martin's fault.
[00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:19.280]   Britney Spears. Somebody said, Oh, she's young. She's sexy.
[00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:23.760]   Centered a sweet and they recorded, you know, hit me baby one more time and the rest is
[00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:25.920]   something.
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:28.560]   See, sure. Yeah.
[00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:32.320]   By the way, I love my friends in Norway and I'm sorry.
[00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:32.880]   I said, yes.
[00:59:32.880 --> 00:59:33.360]   Exactly.
[00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:37.120]   A lot of, a lot of people get found by going viral now though. That's the other thing that
[00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:40.480]   happens, whether it's SoundCloud or TikTok or something like that. There are lots of artists
[00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:42.160]   who that is. That is a great break.
[00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:43.920]   Made his success on TikTok, right?
[00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:45.760]   And then they go into the machine.
[00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:47.440]   And then they go into the machine. Yeah.
[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:49.040]   Some, sometimes they're already in the machine.
[00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:51.680]   So you think now it's created?
[00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:58.000]   No, a little as an ex-person. That was a $30 beat he bought for Old Town Road.
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.440]   You think they think they like, come here kid.
[01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:01.760]   Yeah.
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:08.800]   So, so, so, so, no, it's, it's just that they use that, that platform a lot now, you know,
[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:09.280]   like so.
[01:00:09.280 --> 01:00:10.720]   And now they know.
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:14.800]   And there was a, you wanted to feel like it's coming up from nowhere.
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:15.280]   Yes.
[01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:18.480]   Because, because, you know, when we were in Alternative Rock, there was this thing,
[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:21.280]   even though there were bands coming through that like Pearl Jam, we knew that Pearl Jam was
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:25.840]   going to be big AOR. So, but, but as Pearl Jam came through, you had, they had to do the
[01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:30.560]   stop through Alternative Rock or the Alternative Rock folks would never listen to them again.
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:35.120]   You know, like if they went straight to AOR or pop, they wouldn't, they'd just be ignored by this
[01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:39.760]   holes. You know, they had to kind of go through that, that process, same thing with Live and other
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:44.320]   ones like that. And so, so that you, there was a process of getting certain kinds of guitar
[01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:50.560]   bass bands through. In the same way now, you want people to be, you want to feel like it's coming
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:55.840]   up like Billy Eilish or, or a little Nas X or whatever. And you want to feel that way,
[01:00:55.840 --> 01:00:57.600]   whether it actually is or not.
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:02.160]   Now, remember Halsey had this rebellion where she, she was really pissed off because the labels
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:06.080]   are pushing her, pushing her to TikTok or songs because it was the best way to,
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:09.360]   you know what, they've lost radio. That's part of the problem. They used to have a vehicle to
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:12.800]   promote songs. Well, I don't, this gets back into not wanting to listen to something I don't
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:17.840]   want to listen to. I mean, I have, I never listened to, I mean, I, I, you know, I was a music director
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:22.240]   for a radio station and I haven't heard more than, you know, 10 minutes of radio and probably a
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:28.080]   doubt, you know, like it's, it's very unusual. Yeah. So, I just, I love the fact that people can
[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:32.640]   kind of come from unexpected places. And there's an artist that I really like named Maggie Rogers who,
[01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:37.360]   you know, she had tried, she was in bands and she tried to break and it never worked.
[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:46.960]   And she went to a, like a masterclass at what NYU, I think. And, and she played one of her songs
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:55.120]   for Pharrell Williams. And he starts to cry during it. And that goes viral. And Maggie Rogers
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:02:00.960]   immediately has a record deal. And she finally, she makes it. But what, what it took was Pharrell
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:07.280]   to hear her song and, and cry a little and have that go viral. And I love it because she's a great
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:13.920]   artist. And again, I think there is some argument to be made that being through the viral filter
[01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:18.800]   of TikTok or, you know, or, or any, any other place or sound cloud back in the day, where
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:23.200]   something can go truly go viral. I think it says something about you as an artist. It may not say
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:28.320]   that your stuff is the greatest, but it means that it had a resonance somehow. And, and that's good.
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:33.360]   I mean, we would never have heard of Maggie Rogers had Pharrell not wept at her song Alaska. So it's
[01:02:33.360 --> 01:02:37.520]   pretty awesome. And, and then the question is, can you maintain it, you know, like in this week in
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:41.920]   music, but the, but can you maintain it, you know, like you look at trendsetter as a good example,
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:47.680]   trendsetter was really popular in TikTok back in the early days of TikTok. And you know, the,
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:51.840]   the original song was not listenable, in my opinion, but then it got remixed and it's gotten,
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:58.640]   you know, 250 million listens or something like that on YouTube. And, but both are both a remix
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:02.880]   artist and the artist that sang are gone. Like, you know, like they're there somewhere, but they're
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:07.440]   not, you know, and it just, it was a, you know, and I get you have one hit wonders all the time,
[01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:13.440]   but, but it is, it's really hard on your own to, to leverage that without the infrastructure of the,
[01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:17.840]   of the industry. So we say that it's good that we're going to get rid of the industry, but,
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:22.320]   you know, there's still, there's still a lot of reasons to have some management that's helping you
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:26.800]   do it. And the question is, are they going to, are they helping you or are they enabling all your
[01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:30.560]   bad habits so they can make more money? So that's the, that's always the challenge.
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:38.560]   It's well, you know, this is a perfect example of how the internet has completely flipped everything
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:43.360]   around and changed it. And everybody's trying to figure out how to survive. And
[01:03:43.360 --> 01:03:48.400]   Apple's decided that putting more gambling ads in the app store is really the way to make.
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:56.320]   That went really bad really fast. Like, like it was like, wow, that, that, that, when you don't see
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:04:01.520]   Apple wipe out very often, but a lot of us have been, you know, like, like that was just a complete
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:07.200]   wipeout. And, and it's, uh, yeah, because I watched it, I watched everyone getting really upset. I don't,
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:11.120]   you know, I just didn't, I didn't seem very many of them, but I would just like, uh, um, but I was like,
[01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:16.160]   how people are really upset about this. And I think overall, Apple's just be out of ads. Like,
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:20.560]   I know that it's a growing market for them. They should not. Yes. Apple was, uh, yeah,
[01:04:20.560 --> 01:04:25.040]   Mark, I think I don't know why Apple changed their tune. By the way, they've now said we're
[01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:29.600]   going to put a pause on gambling ads, but I think pause on ads. Yeah. Well, they should,
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:35.920]   but they're not. Uh, Mark Armand's tweet. I think I'm guessing Marco has some pull over there.
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:40.960]   Now my app's product page shows gambling ads, which are really not okay with Apple shouldn't
[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:47.440]   be okay with it either. The app store has corrupted such a great company so deeply.
[01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:52.880]   They make so much from gambling and the manipulative in app purchases. They don't even see the problem
[01:04:52.880 --> 01:04:58.560]   anymore. So here's his screenshot of being featured as the app of the day overcast. You might also
[01:04:58.560 --> 01:05:03.440]   like William Hill's sports betting that on football, of course, everybody listens to overcast
[01:05:03.440 --> 01:05:09.200]   wants to bet on football and horse racing. Uh, Apple realizing this was a black mark on their
[01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:13.760]   escutcheon. Yeah, but you, you would, you would think that they would say,
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:19.040]   this, this, this, this was not, they, this, it wasn't that they had this file of a thousand
[01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:24.240]   categories that they just dumped bed dumped into the ad system. It's like this was a, this was a,
[01:05:24.240 --> 01:05:29.200]   a considered act. And maybe at some point someone might have thought perhaps we should make sure
[01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:34.640]   that people can't, that people who are looking for, uh, mental health apps and apps that help
[01:05:34.640 --> 01:05:39.360]   you to quit addiction to gambling do not see ads for gambling apps. No, comparatively not. It's,
[01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:45.280]   this was a good point too. Yeah. It's rare that, I mean, Alex has spot on this is, it's rare that
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:50.320]   you see a cell phone like this from, from Apple, a story that begins with, in retrospect, this was
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:55.440]   an obvious mistake. Yeah. I mean, one of the questions, what is their, they're trying to,
[01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:59.440]   they're a product company, right? They're a product company. And so the idea here is that they want
[01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:05.600]   people to be loyal customers. And yet these ads are not, not only cynical because you have to go
[01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:10.720]   to the app store, there's no alternative. And they've already had, you know, they're taking money,
[01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:15.440]   they're extracting more money out of app developers by having them say, you know, they take their,
[01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:19.680]   their 30 or 15 in some cases, percent. And then they say, but you know, if anyone wants to find
[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:24.400]   your app, you got to take some of that 70 or 85% we gave you and you got to give it back to us so
[01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:28.880]   that we can make your thing visible, right? Like it's already kind of a racket and it wouldn't be so
[01:06:28.880 --> 01:06:32.960]   bad if they were alternatives, but it, because it's exclusive, it's the only place you can go.
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:37.520]   And with app tracking transparency, a lot of other app marketing has disappeared now.
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:42.000]   And so it's really the only place you can go. So it's already kind of gross. This is just like a
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:46.640]   layer, the fact that it's so lazy that it's not really categorized and it's just like selling to
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:51.840]   everywhere you're budding into someplace that you're not even relevant there, but we're going to put
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:57.200]   you there anyway, just, you know, just to get your nose in the door here. And there's nobody, and I
[01:06:57.200 --> 01:07:01.360]   admit to having strong feelings about this, because I spent the last like five years of my old corporate
[01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:08.320]   job as arguing with salespeople who kept one to incrementally increase revenue by making the product
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:13.760]   worse. And I, and depending on who my boss was at the time, I was sometimes the only voice in the
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:19.760]   room saying, you're going to drive away our customers and our audience, and our customers are our
[01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:24.720]   audience, our customers are not our advertisers. They are our audience and without them were nothing.
[01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:30.640]   And I wonder sometimes looking at Apple and the App Store in the modern day, if there's anybody
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:37.360]   there with a voice who can be heard to say, no to incremental revenue because it hurts the product.
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:43.680]   And this action is a sign that there isn't. Yeah, I have always thought the worst thing about the
[01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:49.360]   App Store and approaching being disgusted by this is that as a consumer, I don't get to simply say,
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:54.480]   well, show me every text editor that you have. Well, no, we'll, we'll show you the top X of them,
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:57.440]   we'll show you once they're being promoted, we'll show you once they're being advertised.
[01:07:57.440 --> 01:08:00.560]   We don't care if you're willing to sit there and just scroll, scroll, scroll for two hours.
[01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:06.160]   It's if it's not something that Apple has in some way selected to be presented in front of you,
[01:08:06.160 --> 01:08:10.160]   you're just not going to find it unless you unless you hit upon the magic keyword that will surface
[01:08:10.160 --> 01:08:14.320]   this thing that that that you didn't know you're looking for, but you're glad that you found,
[01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:18.800]   you're kind of out of it. It's a terrible way to treat app developers as a terrible way to treat
[01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:25.920]   customers. And it's so corrosive because it gives Apple know Apple doesn't have any reason to make
[01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:30.880]   App Store search or other App Store algorithms better, right? Because Apple could theoretically
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:35.760]   make it so good that it's like, oh, you're, we know about you because of course they can track
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:40.320]   you because it's all first party and therefore it's not gross or creepy. And we know about you,
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:43.760]   when we built an algorithm, so we know what apps you're going to like. But if they do that,
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:48.480]   they kind of undercut their search business. So they just don't and the search and the algorithms
[01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:54.240]   in the App Store aren't very good. So it's corrosive on that way. And then John Gruber made a good point
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:09:00.560]   on daring fireball this week, where he pointed out how the perception among members of the public
[01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:05.360]   is that all of those App Store editorial stories where there's actually an editorial team at Apple
[01:09:05.360 --> 01:09:10.960]   who writes stories about apps that they think are cool and has nothing to do with paid placement.
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:15.120]   It's entirely editorial. I mean, it's marketing, right? Because it's the App Store and it's Apple,
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:20.320]   but it's entirely the decision of the people in App Store editorial about what they want to feature.
[01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:24.720]   And everybody thinks those are ads. And that is another one of these side effects. But once you open
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:30.800]   the door to content in the App Store being for pay, even when you create not for pay content,
[01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:35.520]   people just assume that somebody paid somebody to write this nice feature about them, even though
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:40.000]   that's not true. So there's so many knock on effects of Apple getting into the ad business,
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:45.680]   especially in the App Store. I think they're all bad. And I think the question is, is it worth it?
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:50.480]   Is the extra incremental worth it? I just don't see how it is that there's nobody to tell them no.
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:55.120]   It's just such a small amount of revenue and maybe they'll grow it into something. But the more it
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:10:01.600]   grows, the worse it will feel. So the more successful they are, the more weird it's going to be. And
[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:05.920]   especially when they're blocking other tracking and everything else, I completely agree that that
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:11.040]   is just like they it's so easy right now because they are a product company, they are not dependent
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:16.400]   on advertising for them to be above it. You know, to just say, hey, our environments are not that,
[01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:22.240]   our environments don't do that. And it's a nice, clean, quiet place when we recommend something to
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:25.680]   you, it has nothing to do with money, it has to do with this is the most likely thing that you'd
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:31.920]   like. You know, they this is I just feel like that's the Apple that that should be the Apple
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:38.240]   approach to this not money grubbing. Well, the Apple approach to it is just to keep it covert.
[01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:49.840]   As out of sync says in our IRC, loot boxes are basically gambling. And that's how most apps make
[01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:56.000]   money and Apple makes 30% on those loot boxes. It's just more covert, right? It's not as obvious
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:04.720]   as an actual ad for gambling at the NFL, advertises and now is shares in gambling revenue from fan
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:10.800]   dual and draft Kings. And I think that's really tarnished their reputation. But get ready, you
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:16.240]   know, the station radio station I worked at in San Francisco just closed down its news talk in
[01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:22.080]   favor of a sports gambling format. This is the way the world is going. It's kind of a
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:26.400]   crappification of everything. I think the reason the app developers get so mad about this is that
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:32.080]   because the app store is their only home that they're allowed on the platform. And there that
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:36.400]   means that basically like if your Marco Arment, your entire overcast business is really built
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:41.680]   around the overcast product page. And it's not as if Apple comes to Marco and says, Hey, Marco,
[01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:46.320]   can we put some ads on your page and we'll we'll cut you in for a rev share? No, no, Apple says,
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:51.600]   we're going to just put anything we want, including stuff that you hate on your page. And there's
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:56.160]   nothing you can do about it. And we get all the money. And you have no recourse because you're
[01:11:56.160 --> 01:12:02.000]   trapped in our platform and there's no alternative to the app store. And it's like, again, is each
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:06.800]   one of those is it in itself like a little micro offense, but you put it all together and it's
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:12.480]   super offensive. Back in August, Mark Gurman said this is because Apple advertising VP Todd
[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:18.960]   Tiresi began reporting directly to Eddie Q. And that Teresa told Q, I'm going to increase our
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:25.200]   advertising revenue from four billion annually to billions in the double digits. I'm going to
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:31.120]   more than double it. And apparently, Teresa has had free reign ever since.
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:36.480]   Yeah, somebody was in the this was in the the german newsletter, which that said, and it hasn't,
[01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:40.480]   I don't know if it's happened yet. They were going to looking at ads in the maps app as well.
[01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:42.720]   First Google already does that.
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:48.240]   So who who's who's able to say no to that guy? And right now I feel like nobody's saying no to
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:54.160]   that guy. Although this week or last week, maybe somebody realized you cannot give that guy free
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:59.200]   reign because I hate to I hate to make a villain of any person because I don't know what's going on
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:03.040]   on the inside. But I'm just going to come out and say it. I think this guy's a villain. I think
[01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:10.000]   this guy has been his job is to do things that I think are fundamentally corrosive to Apple's products.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.240]   And the question is not this guy. I mean, I can say he's a villain. He's doing his job.
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:20.480]   The problem is who's his boss? Is it Eddie Q? Is Eddie Q OK with the junkifying of all of Apple's
[01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:26.160]   services is Tim Cook? Who is there to weigh what this guy wants to do in terms of bringing in
[01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:33.440]   incremental small amounts in most cases of revenue and weigh it against how much worse the product
[01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:38.080]   is and if it gets to 10 billion a year, it's not that incremental. It's not. Well, I mean, all right,
[01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:42.880]   let's let's see it though, but it's incremental compared to the iPhone, right? Like this is the
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:47.280]   Apple doesn't need to do it is your point. Whether it's incremental or not. They don't need to do it.
[01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:52.960]   But also what I find a little bit suspicious is that obviously Apple didn't talk about the ad
[01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:58.320]   revenue business ad part of their business during the act. The majority of the call, Tim was asked
[01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:03.200]   specifically about it during the Q and A by an analyst and he parried the hell out of it. He
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:07.840]   said, well, privacy is a fundamental right. We're not doing anything that steps away from the
[01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:15.600]   in our specific advertising business is not large in relative to others and so forth. I'm not that
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:21.760]   not me that is actually is not not large. We're not Facebook. We're not Google, but we but we don't
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:26.800]   release the exact numbers on it. But it's clearly not large. Well, if it's a multi billion dollar
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:32.080]   part of your business, maybe you should and someone asks you specifically, like asking, are there any
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:36.960]   metrics any vectors you can talk about to give us a sense of how big those businesses are? Yeah,
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:41.280]   that's suspicious that he parried the hell out of that one. The only other one that he parried off,
[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:47.040]   interestingly enough, were questions about Apple's labor relations. So make of that also not the
[01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:54.080]   best record in the world. Yeah, interesting. Well, you know, Apple's a look at this. I've said this
[01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:57.760]   for a long time. Apple's a corporation and they're not your buddies. Of course,
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:02.880]   and they're not your friends. They're they have a fiduciary responsibility to stakeholders to profit
[01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:06.800]   to make profit. And I think to some degree, we've really set it up in this country that
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:15.680]   there is actually a bit of discord between companies whose incentives are to make money
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:20.880]   and customers who say, well, what about us? And a lot of times, companies do to make money
[01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:24.480]   does not serve the customer. But I think that's not their incentive.
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:29.120]   I think the argument is that they could prop their they may whatever they make with the
[01:15:29.120 --> 01:15:33.280]   advertising, it may cost them more money in the long run. So even from a stockholder position,
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:38.240]   I would hope they would think that but they don't think long term of the shininess of the platform.
[01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:43.120]   Yes. Just by having a shinier platform and a quieter platform will probably make them more
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:46.560]   than the advertising will. It's just an unforced error.
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:51.840]   It's they need somebody like Jason Snell did at his magazine to step forward and say, no, no,
[01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:57.680]   that's look, it's so hard to turn down extra money. And I get it. And so, and especially,
[01:15:57.680 --> 01:16:05.280]   I will say, when you're at a tech magazine company in the 2010s, you're in way more dire
[01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:12.720]   financial rates than Apple is. But even there, like even there, you it's so hard to turn down
[01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:18.480]   more money, right? Because the answer is what what they'll say to you is the ad salespeople like
[01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:23.520]   this guy will say, but it's just more money. There's no downside. There's more money. And the answer is
[01:16:23.520 --> 01:16:29.280]   there is no such thing as a free lunch. There is always a downside. But the downside is the bigger
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:35.040]   picture. And you need someone who sees the bigger picture. And that's, and that's why, again, I can't
[01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:39.760]   really demonize this guy who I already called a villain because he's doing his job. The problem is
[01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:47.360]   who gave him his job? Who gave him his incentives to do his job? And who is looking at what he does
[01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:53.040]   and evaluating whether it makes sense for Apple's business as a whole? And I get the feeling that
[01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:59.200]   up to now they basically let him do whatever he wants. And and somebody needs to say, Todd,
[01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:04.720]   that's off limits. And I don't think anybody has yet. That's that's leadership. Where you're
[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:10.960]   taking the whole list of you of the company, not just this bottom line revenue. We deal with the
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:16.640]   same thing. You know, most every time I've worked in radio, you take every advertiser walks in the
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:23.280]   door. It doesn't matter how horrible they are. And when I started to it, I said, no, I really
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:26.720]   would like to make sure that I would like to say no to advertisers. I want to make sure that we
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:32.400]   only have ads that I can legitimately endorse. And that's a hard, especially when companies are
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:39.120]   troubled. That's a hard line to hold. It is it is brutal to be the person who says, let's not take
[01:17:39.120 --> 01:17:44.160]   this check that this guy is handing us. But that's why you have to be adult enough to have the big
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:49.200]   picture thing, which is like, what does this do to my business if I take this check? Does it make
[01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:55.040]   my product worse and my customers who are my listeners or readers or viewers or whatever,
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:18:01.120]   or iPhone users less happy? And does that have a knock on effect that I need to worry about big
[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:05.920]   pictures? Because the salesperson is in their incentive is to sell because they get a probably
[01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:09.440]   a commission, right? They're probably even a percentage attached to their job is not to think.
[01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:13.280]   It's like they're like a shark. Well, not only that, somebody's cracking a whip saying sell more,
[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:18.720]   sell more, sell more. So they're not incentivized. No, no. And it's the job of management to say,
[01:18:18.720 --> 01:18:23.920]   okay, not that one. And thank God I have Lisa who understands when and she and I have approval on
[01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:27.520]   every advertiser, she understands, you know, sometimes we're going to say no to advertisers.
[01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:33.680]   Sometimes we we go, there was a company about eight, nine, 10 months ago that wanted to do,
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:41.680]   they wanted to sell Bitcoin in your 401k. And I said, I don't think we want to do that one.
[01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:48.640]   Thank God. All right, I have to take a little break. We've come back much more to talk about.
[01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:55.440]   But we do have to do an ad and if a nice company that we like and approve and think very highly of
[01:18:55.440 --> 01:19:00.800]   actually company, anybody who runs a shop with a lot of Apple devices will want to know about.
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:08.000]   Maybe you already know about Adegee, Adegee, A D D I G Y helps you do more than just manage
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:15.200]   your Apple devices. It's the only fully cloud based, multi tenant Apple MDM platform designed
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:20.000]   for scalability. Adegee gives you the features, the functionality, the flexibility you need to
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:26.800]   customize and manage your Apple devices, how you want. I think probably every shop now is to
[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:32.480]   some degree an Apple shop, thanks to BYOD. But you can ensure your Apple infrastructure is
[01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:37.680]   optimized to best support your environment and help your team be as productive as possible.

[01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:09.280]   And Adegee is different because they support some features that I know you want, like Zero
[01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:14.000]   Touch Deployment, you don't want to have to get on every system. You can get new members on board
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:19.760]   securely in under five minutes, hands off secure authentication with trusted providers eliminates

[01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:47.360]   you get self service capabilities, which means your IT team doesn't have to handle endless reset
[01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:54.560]   requests with 24/7 access to resources and applications for your users. They like that too.

[01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:36.080]   know you saw it here. Adegee.com/twit. Some executive movement. I don't know if it means a lot,
[01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:44.800]   but Apple's online store. Chief Anna Matthiasen is leaving, and their CIO,
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:56.720]   Mary Dembe, is leaving. That's three vice presidents in recent weeks. If you include
[01:22:56.720 --> 01:23:01.680]   Evan's hanky, who is the design officer, is also leaving the company.
[01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:07.920]   I wonder how much of that movement that Apple historically gets is based on the fact that
[01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:12.000]   there is a definite ceiling that you are not going to breach, that either you're part of the club,
[01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:18.560]   that is going to be one of the elite six, or you are basically going to have a really good
[01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:24.320]   career as the vice president of retail, and that's as far as you want to go at. But if you want to
[01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:28.080]   run an entire company, if you want to have more responsibility than just running retail part of
[01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:33.680]   a large corporation, you're going to have to go someplace else. It is a lot of people leaving in
[01:23:33.680 --> 01:23:38.800]   short span of time, which isn't suspicious, but it's interesting, isn't it?
[01:23:38.800 --> 01:23:42.720]   I think it also has something to do with a high stock valuation.
[01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:48.560]   The many, many splits, and I think some of these people are going, "Hey, you know what?
[01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:53.280]   I'm just looking at my portfolio here, and I don't have to work ever again."
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:58.000]   Dembe has been there for three decades. She's retiring as the CIO.
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:03.280]   Losing Evan's hanky, I think we talked about this last week, I think that's a bigger deal.
[01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:10.720]   She was Johnny Ives handpicked successor in charge of industrial design. I think that's a big deal.
[01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:17.120]   Chief privacy officer Jane Horvath has also left. She took a job at a law firm, interestingly.
[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:23.760]   Yeah, I don't think it doesn't mean anything. It's normal transitions.
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:30.800]   I do think there's very little churn at Apple. I agree that once you get to a certain level,
[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:34.880]   you're probably going to have to go somewhere else to go any further.
[01:24:34.880 --> 01:24:38.000]   No, it's a good job. It's got to be a great job.
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:43.040]   It's like wanting to be the captain, the Enterprise D. The captain is really there.
[01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:47.440]   His first in command is turning down transfers to captain other ships.
[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:49.600]   Yeah, you're going to be on the third seat for quite a while.
[01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:58.000]   The one more revolving door is the retail job. There've been quite a few people running
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:05.520]   Apple's online, not retail online store. I have that online store to me still feels
[01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:14.240]   very janky. The backend, it's not using web objects. I don't think it's there anymore,
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:22.400]   but it feels like it. They did that whole thing where it was like the online equivalent of how
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:27.600]   there's no line at the Apple store in person where they said, "No, there is no Apple store on apple.com."
[01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:31.280]   You just buy things wherever you are. Then a couple of years ago, they're like,
[01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:36.960]   "Oh, yeah, we need a store." They put the store back. I feel like they're still getting over that.
[01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:40.960]   I think the experience in the Apple store having bought a bunch of stuff there is it's not
[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:44.720]   gotten better online. Occasionally, I just went there. This is what I got.
[01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:52.880]   This is the page I got when I just loaded the Apple store. This is the John. I think John's 404.
[01:25:53.440 --> 01:26:00.640]   John, there you go. Store. This is the entire page. The best way to buy the products you love.
[01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:05.200]   Store. Oh, wait a minute. There it is down here. There's a whole bunch of white space there.
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:09.520]   No products. I see stuff there. I know. I just didn't finish loading.
[01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:17.360]   I'm telling you that some portion of people are going to see that. I personally see that all
[01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:20.960]   the time. I guess I'm used to that. Maybe you don't see it if you're in Safari on a Mac.
[01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:24.240]   Maybe that's really the problem because I'm not always, in fact, I'm rarely on.
[01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:31.680]   See, I just refreshed it the same thing. Store. Let me say Apple store. Show it again. Store.
[01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:39.680]   It's just a store. Let me refresh it again. Yeah, no, no.
[01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:47.280]   So there's something wrong. That's a hard refresh. Something wrong with their web objects.
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:52.960]   I'm telling you, they need to, you know what you should do? Go to Tesla. Get 50 Tesla
[01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:56.960]   engineers. Those great people have written the full self-driving software. Bring them in to
[01:26:56.960 --> 01:27:04.160]   review the code. Have your software engineers printed out for them. And I think I love that.
[01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:06.480]   I love that. I really don't already know. By the way,
[01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:13.680]   talking about being a crap boss, you saw the way Elon decided to add the,
[01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:19.040]   what was it? Some feature blue check, I guess, is to say, you have one week to do it. If you
[01:27:19.040 --> 01:27:28.560]   don't do it, you're fine. Yeah, that's very apprentice. That's like, okay. Yeah, glad I'm working
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:32.560]   for it. To get it all working great. Oh, yeah. Oh, that's the way to get, you know,
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:39.760]   nothing like the new guy coming in to say, Hey, I created a company for tunneling Teslas between
[01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:44.960]   two cities. That kind of genius is applicable to everything. We went, we were staying at the
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:48.400]   resort worlds where in Las Vegas, Las Vegas, we got to kick myself because it was the only place
[01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:55.120]   there's a boring tunnel from that hotel to the convention center. That's it back and forth in a
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:28:03.920]   Tesla. That's the tunnel. And I wish I'd gone in it. It was, it's only 350 for a day pass. You
[01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:09.440]   ride all day. All you want back and forth back and forth in a tunnel. It's only about two blocks
[01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:15.280]   or three blocks. It's not very far, but it'll totally scale up. No problem. Absolutely no problem.
[01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:21.920]   That's genius. Genius. Has anybody tried free form yet? It's the public bait is out. Have you
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:27.120]   tried it, Jason? You seem like a public beta kind of guy. Yeah, it's, I need to spend more time
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:32.400]   with it. But it's, I feel like we haven't had an app like this in a little while where
[01:28:32.400 --> 01:28:39.440]   maybe clips where Apple actually is making essentially what would be like a first,
[01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:43.520]   it's like a third party app from a first party developer where they're actually trying to say
[01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:49.760]   we're going to build something using our term, our technology and have it be like using all our
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:54.640]   latest stuff and be something you can use. I like the idea. It's almost like an iWork app
[01:28:55.520 --> 01:29:05.440]   that is like, remember iWork, but numbers and keynotes and pages. Freeform is trying to be
[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:10.320]   one of those where it's collaborative if you want it to be and you can drop things in and sketch
[01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:16.560]   stuff out. I love that they're trying it. I don't know what I think of it based on the first beta,
[01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:22.080]   whether it's something that appeals to me or not. But I really like that they're giving it a shot.
[01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:28.800]   And it does show off some of their technologies too. Apple used to be a company where all of the
[01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:33.760]   Apple apps were like the models that all the third party app developers would look to and say,
[01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:39.360]   this is what I want to be like. I want to be like these Apple apps. And that Apple kind of has lost
[01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:46.800]   their way on that, on that front. So this feels like, you know, an app from an earlier era in that
[01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:53.760]   regard. It's going to be part of iOS 16.2, which will be out next month, apparently. But you can get
[01:29:53.760 --> 01:30:00.560]   it now if you're doing the public beta of iOS or iPad OS. So it looks like a whiteboard.
[01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:07.040]   But can you embed stuff from other works apps and stuff like that or iWork apps?
[01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:12.080]   It's you can drag stuff in and it uses sort of like the natural drag and drop stuff. So if you
[01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:16.560]   drag in a web page, it'll give you like a web page preview. And it's it is a hyperlink, but it's
[01:30:16.560 --> 01:30:20.480]   also got the big web page preview. And you can put video in there that plays or no?
[01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:24.720]   I don't know if I've tried that one. The one that I thought was very cool is it actually gives you
[01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:30.560]   a reason to use that feature where you can lift and a subject out of a photo. Love that. It's
[01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:33.680]   actually a good use of that. I do that all the time. You can lift a subject out of a photo and drop
[01:30:33.680 --> 01:30:40.240]   it on the on the pace board there on the canvas. And then you've got it cut out and then you can
[01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:45.120]   draw you know straw mustache on them or whatever you want to do. And yeah, I mean,
[01:30:45.120 --> 01:30:51.040]   I don't know. One of the challenges is it is literally a free form tool, right? It is what
[01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:56.560]   you want to do with it. But I think that's the idea is a shared whiteboard that can be an
[01:30:56.560 --> 01:31:01.360]   accompaniment to using you know, FaceTime or using other iWork apps. I think that's what
[01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:09.440]   they're going for there. Yeah, it is a little bit weird though to me that does this merit
[01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:15.200]   inclusion into the main release of iOS. Does this merit something that is part of a feature set of
[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:24.720]   every single iPad that Apple ships and how you can get pages and numbers and yeah, but those
[01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:29.200]   things are now misfree. It's free for something you have to download from the app store. Is it
[01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:35.040]   is unclear, right? It's in the OS and the data's but it might be an app store download in the long
[01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:40.160]   run. I don't know that because I know there's a free form switch in iCloud settings in regular
[01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:45.360]   system settings. So I would think it would be if as part of iWorks, it would be it would make sense.
[01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:53.280]   It would be I don't know. It really guarantees that okay, we are definitely in all Apple shop
[01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:57.600]   now because if we are doing all of our project, so much of our brainstorming and project management
[01:31:57.600 --> 01:32:02.400]   on an app that it does not exist on any other platform, whereas every other platform that has
[01:32:02.400 --> 01:32:06.320]   whiteboard and brainstorming software makes sure that it's available everywhere including the web.
[01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:14.880]   That's quite a big ask, but it's it's it's it's it's it's a great show offer Apple technologies. I just
[01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:22.320]   wonder why Apple is not happy. It wouldn't be happier. I wonder why they wouldn't just simply
[01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:28.240]   say we're gonna make sure that we feel as though collaborative whiteboard software is a really,
[01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:34.240]   really important sector for all of our products. We are going to be extra extra extra indulgent
[01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:38.720]   to developers of those apps and extra hands-on and giving them access to stuff that other people
[01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:42.720]   don't have access to to make sure that they can make the most beautiful and competitive
[01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:49.360]   apps of this kind. I don't know why if they decide to make it as as part of the actual operating system,
[01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:53.440]   I don't know why they would do that. I'm not questioning it. I'm saying that it doesn't
[01:32:53.440 --> 01:33:01.040]   make instinctive sense to me. Yeah, my question is, is it clips, as you said, Jason, where it's just
[01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:06.480]   right some guy wrote it and throw that in or is there something deeper there? Like, is it going
[01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:12.000]   to be an augmented reality thing? Is it some sort of I think it is. I think it's more strategic and I
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:16.640]   think it's it spins out of these collaboration features that they added. Although to Andy's point,
[01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:23.120]   I feel like there is a group. It's like a consensual hallucination with an Apple, which is let's
[01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:28.880]   pretend, and it is true to a certain extent, but let's pretend that there are work groups out there
[01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:36.000]   in education and in the regular working world that only use Apple devices and they use Apple's
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:40.320]   apps to collaborate and they use our new because they added these new collaboration features that
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:44.560]   basically they're very clever. What they're using is they're like using iCloud and messages and
[01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:49.360]   they're tying documents together and letting you share them and you can collaborate in a document
[01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:53.920]   and comment on it in messages and all that. So there's this premise that's like they're using
[01:33:53.920 --> 01:34:01.920]   only our tools and like, oh, those people who we've created theoretically, need a whiteboard. So let's
[01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:06.960]   make a whiteboard for them. I think I think that's going on and I think also the reason that it's
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:13.040]   tied to the operating system release is probably in part that they're tying it to those collaboration
[01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:19.040]   features and that's probably where it came from is we want to create a way a shared some space
[01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:26.080]   between messages and pages or numbers or whatever that is and there is an API for third party apps.
[01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:30.160]   Like we want to create a whiteboard space and we don't want to build it inside of messages.
[01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:35.440]   So we're going to create a whiteboard space that's tied to those messages features and I suspect
[01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:42.080]   that's why we ended up with this. Yeah, that was a big takeaway from from WWDC where they introduced
[01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:48.240]   freeform that it occurred to me that Apple wants to sort of leverage messages into something
[01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:55.920]   not like Slack but maybe more like a Slack like central meeting plays for people who are working
[01:34:55.920 --> 01:35:00.960]   together and people who are in a certain group so that conversations will start in will start in
[01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:07.440]   messages and then branch out into into a freeform and then branch out into actual like video chats
[01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:11.680]   and then document sharing all through links that are being mentioned and then actioned upon within
[01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:17.680]   messages. So as an extension of this, basically, we want we want messages to be sort of the central
[01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:23.840]   central hub of allotted for our collaboration features. It makes sense to extend out that hub
[01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:28.720]   more with a with a with an app like this. But again, I'm not going to really understand it until I see
[01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:34.320]   them demonstrate the real thing and see how it actually deploys. Yeah. Well, we'll see. You know,
[01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:40.000]   I'm not a huge fan of collaboration, but I'm kind of a loner. I don't really understand collaboration.
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:46.720]   There you go. Yeah. So there's a lot of places where it makes sense when you're sitting there
[01:35:46.720 --> 01:35:51.360]   and you want to talk about something you want to, you know, share those ideas. We're in planning
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:35:56.960]   sessions a lot. Never want to do that. Yeah. Sometimes I'm there. Sometimes I'm doing that for
[01:35:56.960 --> 01:36:01.280]   hours with with. Yeah, no, that makes sense. Yeah. And you're remote. Everybody's remote.
[01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:07.200]   Yeah. I went to I did when I did the Krasney show. I said, we're Shannon, the producer. You
[01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:15.200]   said, Oh, she's in Florida. Oh, you can't tell you can't tell with what you do. Everybody's. It's
[01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:20.160]   weird. Well, and I've been doing that for 20 years. And so you get you get used to it. And it's just
[01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:23.840]   a matter of figuring out what the tools are. I think it's really is the future. So maybe that's
[01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:28.560]   what Apple's saying is, well, you you know, you're going to need a collaborative whiteboard. So
[01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:35.440]   let's make it. I just want to see something more like Google wave or Open Doc where it has
[01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:40.480]   components. Microsoft's doing something like that called loop. That's the seller.
[01:36:41.040 --> 01:36:45.440]   It has a handful of components. Then it has so many components. And then they close it.
[01:36:45.440 --> 01:36:52.480]   Yeah. That's why everybody used. This is incredible. But the problem with Google is is that they'd
[01:36:52.480 --> 01:36:55.520]   always start really simple. Like someone go, okay, we're going to start simple and we're just going
[01:36:55.520 --> 01:36:59.360]   to do an MVP and it's going to come out the door. And then they just put the kitchen sink in like
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:02.000]   like it. And then everyone's overwhelmed. And then they're like, Oh, this doesn't work. And then
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:05.840]   they just quit. Like so that's that's that's that's to be the important thing that Japan
[01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:13.920]   will roll a whole book about it. Yes, it's sad. Good. All right, P hangouts, which I officially
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:18.960]   died today, I think. Oh, today's the last day for Hangouts. Yep. Yep. Another another cool thing
[01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:26.960]   in Jordan. The only cool thing in G plus. Yes. When G plus opened up, I remember going, this is
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:32.320]   such a fresh air. There's just there's nothing, you know, it's clean. And you just have conversations.
[01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:36.800]   And then I really liked the idea of circles where you could have intentional communities. And there
[01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:40.000]   was all that. And then they just went and then we'll add all the stuff that Facebook has that we
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:43.920]   don't have. And they screwed that up, didn't they? It was like, okay, whatever. But you hang
[01:37:43.920 --> 01:37:48.560]   out. It's was cool. But I bet they wonder though, gee, now that Twitter is self-immulating, I wonder
[01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:54.480]   if it let's bring Google plus back. I think that I think someone probably wish they hadn't
[01:37:55.280 --> 01:38:01.600]   I think they burned the code. Yeah. That was the only way to get the smell out.
[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:12.640]   And you may have seen stories about Disney World in Shanghai closing suddenly because of COVID
[01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:16.800]   this weekend. And people were inside still and they couldn't get out.
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:21.040]   Well, you had to be tested to get out and you had to test negative. I don't know where
[01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:26.800]   maybe they had somewhere to put some cuts out on the. I don't know. Can't leave the small front
[01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:35.120]   until you're clear. Apparently same things happening at Foxconn. So in fact, there's some
[01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:40.720]   thought that it might affect iPhone production. iPhone workers are reportedly been walking out
[01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:46.160]   in significant numbers. This is from nine to five Mac after an outbreak of COVID-19 at their biggest
[01:38:46.160 --> 01:38:55.360]   plant in Zhengzhou. So Foxconn's offering big bonuses, which is probably like a buck 50, but
[01:38:55.360 --> 01:39:00.400]   whatever. Two hundred bucks. That's a lot of money. 20% of their monthly income.
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:09.360]   Yeah. To stick around. Yeah. Two hundred bucks. 1500 you won. For anybody who works all their
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:15.520]   shifts from October 26th through November 11th. So it's like double pay for that, you know,
[01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:20.000]   that two week period or something. That's good. Time and a half.
[01:39:20.000 --> 01:39:27.680]   Also burnout. Good union jobs. Yeah. Apple has pulled Kanye. I'm sorry. Yay.
[01:39:27.680 --> 01:39:35.360]   The artist formerly known as Kanye West. There was a Kanye West essentials playlist.
[01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:42.160]   The music is there. There's discographies there. But the playlist, which was the essentials from
[01:39:42.160 --> 01:39:47.440]   his career, for some reason is gone. Yeah. That's a weird thing. They were in the
[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:52.640]   fleet. Well, they were also one of the first music catalogs to just say, yeah, we don't want,
[01:39:52.640 --> 01:39:55.600]   we're not going to promote it. We're going to have it if you want us, but we're not going to promote it.
[01:39:55.600 --> 01:40:02.560]   Yeah. Yeah. deleting his music seems like that would be that that would be excessive. But
[01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:06.400]   like I said, you would only have half the catalog by the time you got through
[01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:11.200]   our Kelly and Michael Jackson. Pretty soon you got nobody. There's nobody left.
[01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:18.320]   Like Eric Clappin said, what? Yeah, I know in the 70s. I know. We have to. We have to give
[01:40:18.320 --> 01:40:25.520]   these guys, you know, let the music speaks for itself. Yes. As long as he doesn't speak for himself.
[01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:38.080]   Daniel Eck decided to Spotify not to take the music out. He says the music doesn't violate our
[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:44.480]   policy. Maybe his label will take action, but we're not going to as as reprehensible as the
[01:40:44.480 --> 01:40:48.880]   things he's saying are. I think I think that's correct because it is, as you say, they're
[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:55.280]   especially as you you talk about people who are people like you who are saying such terrible,
[01:40:55.280 --> 01:41:00.640]   terrible things in modern times. Well, again, go back to 1900, go to what does what does what
[01:41:00.640 --> 01:41:06.000]   does vodka what did Wagner think about certain people? Oh, God. Yes. And yeah, so congratulations.
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:11.120]   One third of all the opera opera. Opera titles are gone. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. So,
[01:41:11.120 --> 01:41:17.840]   and as long as the ideology doesn't creep into the music, which are may, who knows, and then at
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:26.560]   that point, you have to make some decisions as well. Is there anything else Apple patented?
[01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:32.880]   I don't know why patented the glowing apple and that they no longer have. They haven't had since
[01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:38.560]   2015 on the back of the MacBook. So maybe they're bringing it back. Or maybe they just
[01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:41.600]   realized they hadn't patented it and they should better do that quick. Yeah.
[01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:47.200]   I don't know what I think about that. I miss it because I was really cool. It was a really cool
[01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:52.240]   little flourish. But on the other hand, I guess I just wanted to I guess I just want the lid of
[01:41:52.240 --> 01:41:56.400]   my MacBook to be more interesting than Oh, well, there is on the lid of my gray MacBook, there is
[01:41:56.400 --> 01:42:01.600]   a slightly darker gray apple logo on it. Although I appreciate the argument that, hey, if you want
[01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:06.640]   to be flashy, put stickers on it or put a shuttle on it. The thing is people who don't want to be
[01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:11.360]   glowing and have a glowing apple logo at a car around a conference table, they don't have the
[01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:16.480]   option of not having that. But at least of the at least with the MacBook errors, I think that
[01:42:16.480 --> 01:42:21.040]   one of the great opportunities for the air, not in a particularly an error in which it's hard to
[01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:25.840]   tell the difference between an air and a MacBook Pro these days to basically make that the the
[01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:30.720]   the the lint filter of all the fun in the Mac line. Give us the crazy colors. Give us not only a
[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:35.200]   glowing apple logo, but make it make it make it make us give us a system extension so that we can
[01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:38.960]   actually change the color of it. That would be cool. That's a little too gamey.
[01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:45.200]   You'd only have a choice of six colors. No, no, where see, it's restraint on on windows gaming
[01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:51.520]   system. They have RGB. Give us R or G or B. That's one choice. That's fine. I do love that idea.
[01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:57.440]   The idea of like, what if we brought it back and we made it more customizable or modern or cool in
[01:42:57.440 --> 01:43:03.280]   some way? Like, wouldn't that be great? Because, you know, if there's anything that they've killed
[01:43:03.280 --> 01:43:08.480]   that that was fun, it was the people really liked that. And they're like, I know like there were
[01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:13.040]   reasons why and it was almost accidental, right? That was like, well, if we make a cut out there,
[01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:19.040]   then it glows. But then it was really good and it was good branding and it really made you know
[01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:23.200]   that you had an apple laptop and other people around you to know. And for whatever reason,
[01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:27.520]   some killjoy in manufacturing was like, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, let's not do that.
[01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:32.000]   And, you know, now they've got their little polished apple logo there and it's fine,
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:36.640]   but I would love for the glowing logo to come back. So I bought the Midnight.
[01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:42.960]   I couldn't resist. I bought the Midnight Blue M2 MacBook Air knowing that it was fingerprint
[01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:49.600]   city, but I just put a clear case. It's ugly. Beautiful, but I put a clear case on it. So it's
[01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:56.320]   like the museum quality. And then, you know, whenever I put a case on an apple or any laptop,
[01:43:56.320 --> 01:43:59.840]   I'm really tempted to put stickers. So it'll probably end up having a bunch of stickers obscuring
[01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:05.680]   the Midnight Blue. But I do, I have to say, and I'm glad I bought that. Remember, I was
[01:44:05.680 --> 01:44:09.440]   agonizing like, what am I going to do when the new Mac books come out? Well, they ain't going to
[01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:12.240]   come out. What time when will they come out? Do you think March?
[01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:17.520]   Gurman says March. I think it could be earlier than that, but sometime in the first three months
[01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:22.080]   of next year. Yeah, not not June. We don't have to wait till the BWD. I don't think so. And why are
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:29.440]   they waiting? Nobody, nobody knows, right? Like, I mean, there's speculation that they just don't
[01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:33.920]   need to do it, that it complicates the channel. My feeling is that that it's the M2 chip, right?
[01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:38.000]   Because this is going to be a new level of M2 chip and getting a little more time to get that
[01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:41.600]   right and to get their supplies. So it's going to be a better M2 chip than
[01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:48.240]   because when the M1 came out, they did MacBook Air, they did Mac Mini, they did the MacBook Pro 13
[01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:54.320]   inch pause. And then how long? Six months later? Not much longer. They put it out in the spring and
[01:44:54.320 --> 01:44:59.760]   then in the fall, they put out the improved M1 MacBook Pro 1416.
[01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:08.000]   It was in the fall that they did the M1. Oh, then they did the spring for the MacBook Pro.
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:11.200]   It was in the spring and for the Pro and the Mac. So that's the idea is like you're taking that
[01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:14.560]   next step with that new level of-- Do they want to do that every spring then?
[01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:21.200]   So maybe they prematurely released the M2 MacBook Air? I don't think so. I think they're off sync a
[01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:26.000]   little bit. And that they're just, this is the next chip generation for that and maybe they didn't
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:32.960]   have enough of them or, honestly, I think Apple could look at its product line and say, we're good.
[01:45:32.960 --> 01:45:38.400]   Let's not push this right now. And nobody is going to kill us. I mean, I've heard from people
[01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:43.280]   who are like, I've been waiting for that new MacBook Pro. Don't make me buy the old one. But I think
[01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:48.960]   as a whole, as a Gestalt Apple could be like, they're not going to kill us if we move from November to
[01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:55.120]   February. Are you just going to-- Alex, because you wanted the M2 Mac Mini, right? I do. I do.
[01:45:55.120 --> 01:46:00.160]   And I think that they think that they're-- This gets back into that managing expectations that
[01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:06.480]   they think they're going to hit a 1% or 2% growth for the quarter. They may not want to goose it with
[01:46:06.480 --> 01:46:10.000]   anything else and give themselves a little bit more time to work on it, make sure they have a
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:15.120]   little bit more in the pipeline. It doesn't seem like there's any rush on their end. I definitely
[01:46:15.120 --> 01:46:20.560]   really want to buy more Mac Mini's. And so I really want the M2 to come out. So I'm not investing in
[01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:27.760]   them ones, but the M1s are still a pretty good deal. Yeah. I'm disappointed too. But you know what,
[01:46:27.760 --> 01:46:34.000]   if it does-- I'm in a position where I don't have to own one in November. And if it means that waiting
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:39.760]   till March gives me one that has about four or five months of extra sophistication, or it got held
[01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:45.280]   up so that I'm essentially getting the one that I would have cursed myself for not being able to buy
[01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:49.600]   in June because, oh my god, they said it's a simple upgrade. They made it so much better.
[01:46:49.600 --> 01:46:54.320]   OK, I got to be OK with it. Yeah. And I guess having a couple extra months might justify me
[01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:58.800]   buying it when it comes out as well. This M2 is old now.
[01:46:58.800 --> 01:47:06.240]   I have to say, at least when it comes to running common Lisp.
[01:47:06.240 --> 01:47:12.400]   And I know this is important to you all. The M2. forever, man.
[01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:21.120]   That the M2 is about 20 to 30% faster. I re-ran benchmarks and all my software. And it is actually
[01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:27.200]   faster. How does it do on Cobol? I haven't tried the Cobol Fortran benchmarks yet, but I did do the
[01:47:27.200 --> 01:47:32.560]   racket scheme. And it's also about 20% faster. So I'm thinking that there's a--
[01:47:32.560 --> 01:47:37.200]   Nice. Yeah. These are not multi-threaded. I think it's single threaded. So I don't--
[01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:41.840]   Just letting you know. I'm taking the week or the incentive replacement,
[01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:46.560]   keep caps to so you can get APL keyboards. So it's on any S and S and S and S and S layout.
[01:47:46.560 --> 01:47:52.880]   Well, I figure if my common list is running faster than my E-LIS based E-Max is probably also
[01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:59.040]   faster. And since I spent-- Oh my god. I was forced to learn so many terrible languages
[01:47:59.040 --> 01:48:03.280]   in computer science. It was like APL? I don't know. I've never--
[01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:07.600]   It is a pain. OK. That is a pain. I think they were just very-- I just want to make sure you're
[01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:11.120]   serious about wanting to get this degree in computer science. If you make it through this
[01:48:11.120 --> 01:48:17.280]   first year and you learn snowball, OK, you are malleable enough that you will sit patiently
[01:48:17.280 --> 01:48:21.840]   while we teach you about anything. I have a firm rule. I'm not going to learn a new language.
[01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:28.400]   It requires a new keyboard. That's just not going to happen. All right. Let's take a little break.
[01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:34.560]   When we come back, if you would prepare, gentlemen, your picks of the week our show today brought to
[01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:41.280]   you by CashFly. I mean, literally brought to you by-- when you go to the website, when you download
[01:48:41.280 --> 01:48:47.120]   our podcasts, when you subscribe and iTunes or Google, in every case, you're getting it directly
[01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:54.320]   from a server near you via CashFly. It's our content delivery network and it's the best.
[01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:59.600]   Actually, I was just talking to Alex and he says, "I'm kind of interested in this new
[01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:06.240]   WebSocket Live video workflow. CashFly is offering the ultra low latency video streaming.
[01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:09.280]   Are you using WebRTC right now, Alex? Is that what you're--?"
[01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:14.160]   Well, we stream in a lot of different ways. We're using HLS, but definitely not sub one second.
[01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:17.680]   So we're using a variety of versions of HLS, WebRTC.
[01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:21.200]   So you're interested in RTP, but I'm really, really interested in it.
[01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:26.400]   Yes, sub one second latency. Holy cow. That's just kind of mind-boggling.
[01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:32.720]   And of course, because they have total global reach, your content is closer to your users
[01:49:32.720 --> 01:49:37.680]   and can be almost infinitely scaled. CashFly's ultra low latency video streaming
[01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:46.160]   via 50 plus locations around the globe really makes a big difference. And it can ingest multiple
[01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:50.160]   streams in real time. And I mean, there's all sorts of-- it's worth checking this out.
[01:49:50.160 --> 01:49:54.800]   It's really worth checking this out. You might also be interested in something we've
[01:49:54.800 --> 01:49:58.160]   been using for some time kind of unofficially. Now it's official.

[01:52:01.120 --> 01:52:03.840]   Alex, why don't we start with you and your pick of the week this week?
[01:52:04.720 --> 01:52:15.440]   So my pick of the week is an app called Moises. I believe that that's how you say it. Moises.ai.
[01:52:15.440 --> 01:52:22.240]   And what it does is you have to buy the track, but you take a video track or an audio track,
[01:52:22.240 --> 01:52:29.760]   an audio track, you upload it, and it sends you back stems. So if you take like, let's see,
[01:52:29.760 --> 01:52:35.600]   I mean, it is... What's a stem for non-musicians? I'll just play you something here. You can hear
[01:52:35.600 --> 01:52:40.720]   this. Yeah, that's a song. You can hear that. Yeah. Okay. So here, he's about to start singing.
[01:52:40.720 --> 01:52:50.240]   Okay, now I might want to hear just the voice. What? It can unmix the music? Yeah.
[01:52:50.240 --> 01:52:55.360]   And this is just from the raw song, and then if I want to bring the drums up,
[01:52:57.840 --> 01:53:00.080]   that's just him with the drums. Oh, wow. That's amazing.
[01:53:00.080 --> 01:53:06.400]   There's the bass. This goes a long way from taking the arm of the turntable and reversing the
[01:53:06.400 --> 01:53:12.560]   polarity. Well, and then if I want to take the voice out to sing with it, oh my gosh.
[01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:17.040]   Yeah. Or the reason I got it was because my daughter plays the bass,
[01:53:17.040 --> 01:53:23.600]   and so I wanted to get her something that... Without a bass. Yeah. Yeah. So she could play,
[01:53:23.600 --> 01:53:29.040]   you know, she could play in the band. Yeah. So she can either listen to the bass
[01:53:29.040 --> 01:53:33.200]   and play along with it, or immediately reverse that and take the bass out and then play along
[01:53:33.200 --> 01:53:38.640]   with the song. And so for learning how to do it, it's not perfect, and it's not something that,
[01:53:38.640 --> 01:53:41.840]   you know, you're going to steal anybody's music or anything else, because you have to... You do
[01:53:41.840 --> 01:53:46.000]   have to... You can't take it from one of the services. I mean, I just buy the songs off of my songs.
[01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:51.040]   Okay. And but you can... You have to buy it off of the iTunes, or you can... You could
[01:53:51.040 --> 01:53:55.120]   theoretically use, you know, downy, pull it down, rip off the thing, put it in there. So you can,
[01:53:55.120 --> 01:53:59.840]   you know, it's not like it's checking on you or something, but you have to put up an actual
[01:53:59.840 --> 01:54:05.120]   video audio file. And what I've been doing is just throwing it up into my files, my iCloud files,
[01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:09.280]   and then it just sees the... Oh, this is so cool. Now it's free to download.
[01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:15.120]   And it's free for four tracks, up to four tracks. So you get the voice, the drums, the bass,
[01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:20.320]   and everything. Oh, four tracks for unlimited songs. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So you get those four. If you
[01:54:20.320 --> 01:54:24.480]   want the... If you want to separate out the guitar, you got to pay, like, I don't know,
[01:54:24.480 --> 01:54:28.720]   four dollars a month or something like that to separate the guitar out, or strings out, or piano
[01:54:28.720 --> 01:54:33.520]   out. So if you want a little bit more detail out there, you have to pay a little bit more.
[01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:39.040]   And so... But in general, the free version for many people are going to give them what they want.
[01:54:39.040 --> 01:54:41.520]   Well, for many of us, it's just removing the vocals, right? So...
[01:54:41.520 --> 01:54:43.120]   Yeah, exactly. It's single-line. Yeah.
[01:54:43.120 --> 01:54:45.600]   Because it's the old polarity truck. It's way better.
[01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:47.040]   Way better. Very faster. Yeah.
[01:54:47.040 --> 01:54:51.600]   And you can just download it. And then, of course, you can remix it too. So you can kind of push
[01:54:51.600 --> 01:54:56.000]   some stuff back. So you can still... Like, if you want to sing with it, but you want to
[01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:59.360]   still hear some of it so you can keep track of what's going on or what... Or you might want to
[01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:04.000]   listen to the voice just a little bit and have everything up there. All of those things are
[01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:08.880]   available to it. Just a cool little app. I did a search for it because I was trying to figure
[01:55:08.880 --> 01:55:15.120]   out how to separate something out and download a couple of them. And this one was the coolest one
[01:55:15.120 --> 01:55:18.640]   that I... Separate vocals and instruments for any song. AI core detection,
[01:55:18.640 --> 01:55:24.800]   AI-generated metronome, click track, pitch changer. It's really designed for artists
[01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:29.920]   to learn how to play with a song. Like, this is it. I mean, that's what this is about. It's not...
[01:55:29.920 --> 01:55:36.080]   It's really designed and has the tools that are there so that if you wanted to learn how to play
[01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:41.840]   a song with the song, you'd have the tools that you'd do. Great. I wish more songs they would release
[01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:47.680]   the... You call them stems not tracks. We're talking about that. Yeah, I'm talking to a band that,
[01:55:47.680 --> 01:55:54.400]   you know, from the 90s. And we're talking about the idea of recording something like
[01:55:54.400 --> 01:56:01.200]   re-recording songs and releasing them, you know, the new records as... As individual
[01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:04.560]   trams. Or really, what I want to do is release them as logic files.
[01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:11.520]   And so that you can... But the idea for us is to be able to, you know, we'll of course, you know,
[01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:17.360]   stream us. What a great way to practice being a producer, practice mixing, to use
[01:56:17.360 --> 01:56:23.920]   them in sampling, to use it for your music. Maybe that's why they don't do it. Well, again,
[01:56:23.920 --> 01:56:29.520]   it's some artists are very tied tightly to it. And other artists who have... Who are still
[01:56:29.520 --> 01:56:34.480]   sometimes touring, so and so forth, but you know, it's not their... I bet Eris and Blake could do this
[01:56:34.480 --> 01:56:41.040]   safely. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, so I think that, you know, and I think that it's a great way to learn.
[01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:46.800]   It's a great way to have people re-imagine your music. You know, again, some of the stuff in the
[01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:52.400]   past when people put out those samples, I always look back on a band called The Shame and The Put
[01:56:52.400 --> 01:56:57.280]   Out Progen. And Progen was basically all the tracks for the song called Move Any Mountain.
[01:56:57.280 --> 01:57:02.400]   And all of us that were doing raves at the time, you know, we just sampled all of those into our
[01:57:02.400 --> 01:57:06.400]   E-Mewee Max. And that was just part of what we did, you know, like it was just like, and then you
[01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:10.320]   then you played that song because it had all those things that we could that we could, you know,
[01:57:10.320 --> 01:57:17.120]   precursor. There's another app called Serato Pro that does this for DJs. So that separation,
[01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:22.960]   it'll separate all those things out automatically inside the app so that you can do all those remix,
[01:57:22.960 --> 01:57:26.720]   while you're while you're in a show and you can remix songs together. There's a bunch of examples
[01:57:26.720 --> 01:57:33.760]   of people doing it. So this idea of pulling stems is not new. It's interesting though, the AI has
[01:57:33.760 --> 01:57:39.040]   really supercharged it all of a sudden. This is the timely aspect is just a few days ago that
[01:57:39.040 --> 01:57:43.120]   came out with the remix version of Revolver by the Beatles. Oh, I know. I've listened to it.
[01:57:43.120 --> 01:57:49.360]   It is amazing because the stereo version back then was an afterthought and it was a novelty.
[01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:53.360]   And it's a new stereo mix. But the way it worked is because this was not a multi-track recorder,
[01:57:53.360 --> 01:57:59.920]   it was a four-track recording. And so they used the AI tools that Peter Jackson's team built
[01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:05.760]   to isolate all the voices and get back. They use those same tools to isolate all the tracks from
[01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:11.520]   the four-track in Revolver. And then they were able to reproduce the album where they put the bass
[01:58:11.520 --> 01:58:15.280]   because it used to be like all the instruments were on the left and the vocals were on the right.
[01:58:15.280 --> 01:58:20.400]   And they got to move the so the bass is on the left in Taxman, but the guitar is on the right
[01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:26.720]   and the drums are in the center. And because they didn't have all of those instruments on their own
[01:58:26.720 --> 01:58:32.880]   tracks, they couldn't do it without the presumably the like probably among the best AI software to
[01:58:32.880 --> 01:58:38.960]   do this around that they built Forget Back. It is it's a game changer and it's going to change
[01:58:38.960 --> 01:58:44.800]   the remixing of all sorts of old music, right? Because we've gotten to the point where it was
[01:58:44.800 --> 01:58:48.080]   good enough. I mean, I don't want to say it this way, but like it was good enough for the Beatles
[01:58:48.080 --> 01:58:53.520]   essentially that a classic album that everybody's going to know if you've screwed it up. And the
[01:58:53.520 --> 01:58:59.440]   software is now good enough that it doesn't it sounds perfect. Well, and well, it's funny because
[01:58:59.440 --> 01:59:02.720]   I didn't know this and I was listening to Tomorrow Never Knows and they have the
[01:59:02.720 --> 01:59:08.720]   a variety of versions without the vocals. But I thought I kept hearing like is that
[01:59:08.720 --> 01:59:14.880]   is there is there something like cross fade from a headspace of me? And now I understand. Of course,
[01:59:14.880 --> 01:59:19.920]   it was a little bit leaked through because they might have 30 tracks in these things,
[01:59:19.920 --> 01:59:23.600]   but they mix them down because they don't have they have to mix them down mix them down mix them
[01:59:23.600 --> 01:59:28.240]   down. Right. So the best separation you get is four tracks, even though they had many, many,
[01:59:28.240 --> 01:59:33.680]   many more tracks. So that's really interesting. I'm not listening to that with new ears now.
[01:59:33.680 --> 01:59:40.560]   And I think that Apple is doing a lot of spatializing of songs. So there's songs that are remixed from
[01:59:40.560 --> 01:59:44.080]   the tracks, you know, especially in the modern tracks, the last 20 years, people have the tracks
[01:59:44.080 --> 01:59:48.960]   or a lot of them have the tracks. So those are getting remixed and there,
[01:59:48.960 --> 01:59:53.600]   I mean, you talk to people in LA and New York and there's just all these houses have lit up to
[01:59:53.600 --> 01:59:58.480]   try to take advantage of Apple spatializing stuff. And everyone wants to be part of that
[01:59:58.480 --> 02:00:05.600]   kind of wave. And so everything's getting remixed right now. But I think that what Apple's also
[02:00:05.600 --> 02:00:13.040]   doing is using a lot of whatever they're using there, they're spatializing the tunes. So they're
[02:00:13.040 --> 02:00:18.560]   not just stereo. When you listen to Apple music, it gets confusing about whether this was
[02:00:18.560 --> 02:00:24.000]   mixed for Atmos or whether Apple spatialized it, you know, and they're not calling it Atmos
[02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:28.160]   when they do that, but they're, but it does feel like they've taken the instruments and moved them
[02:00:28.160 --> 02:00:33.520]   around. And they're doing that by process reprocessing. They're not talking a lot about how they're
[02:00:33.520 --> 02:00:40.000]   doing that, but they are reprocessing huge amounts of libraries. You can spatialize on AirPods,
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:46.320]   you can spatialize stereo. And that's exactly what they're doing is a processing of the stereo
[02:00:46.320 --> 02:00:52.640]   image to try and create a wider image. It's wild stuff. But this is, you know, so the, we used to
[02:00:52.640 --> 02:00:58.160]   think that the bounced track was the atom of music. And if you didn't have it, if it was just
[02:00:58.160 --> 02:01:03.120]   bounced into like five things mixed together, that was, it could never be separated. It's not true
[02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:07.440]   anymore. And especially if they stay together, like you can do a lot of things about moving them
[02:01:07.440 --> 02:01:12.240]   around as long as you don't change the time. Because that's the, and the tricky part of spatialization
[02:01:12.240 --> 02:01:18.560]   is, is that that's exactly what we do is our, our, this one ear, you know, gets the audio just
[02:01:18.560 --> 02:01:24.080]   slightly at a different time than the other ear. And as a result, that's how we figure out where it
[02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:28.960]   is. We're something, it's not, it's not based on loudness. It's based on timing. And so they can,
[02:01:28.960 --> 02:01:33.600]   they have to re time things in micro, you know, things to move the move things around in time,
[02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:39.920]   in space for us. This is a big category. So we were talking about Moises, M-O-I-S-E-S.A-I.
[02:01:39.920 --> 02:01:44.240]   But the chat rooms come up with a bunch of other tools. Yeah, there's lots of them. Like
[02:01:44.240 --> 02:01:50.480]   Neural Mix Pro, which is available in the Mac App Store. There's an open source product called
[02:01:50.480 --> 02:02:01.440]   Deezer's Bleeder. Works with Deezer. So there's a lot of these, but Moises, I'm going to have to try.
[02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:08.880]   This looks really cool. The Musicians app, iPad and iPhone. Very interesting. Andy, pick of the week.
[02:02:08.880 --> 02:02:14.160]   Mine is something I'm actually hinted at last week. It is the Panic Playdate.
[02:02:14.160 --> 02:02:23.200]   So jelly. I'm so jelly. Yeah, it's, it's, I pre-ordered it like last year in July when,
[02:02:23.200 --> 02:02:28.080]   when on the day the pre-orders first went up and it took until like last month for it to actually
[02:02:28.080 --> 02:02:33.920]   ship. I was in group number three. And I really, really, really like it. It's, if you haven't,
[02:02:33.920 --> 02:02:37.840]   you might have heard of it. If you have an tiny, tiny, tiny little game, oh, it's huge.
[02:02:37.840 --> 02:02:45.040]   It is again, it is very, very cute. It's, it's fun to watch like conventional game reviewers
[02:02:45.040 --> 02:02:49.680]   review it and say, oh, it's stupid. It is, has a black and white display, it's not even black
[02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:55.520]   backlit and like, and it has, oh, has a crank and maybe that's going to be just like a gimmick.
[02:02:55.520 --> 02:03:02.000]   And that would be very, very smart things to say for a lot of different systems. But this was like
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:06.960]   the people at Panic were there. They were not designed, they were not trying to create something
[02:03:06.960 --> 02:03:11.040]   that would compete with Nintendo or anything else you'd seen. They really wanted to create
[02:03:11.040 --> 02:03:15.920]   something that was, that was as unique as this. And it's not often that I would like,
[02:03:15.920 --> 02:03:20.080]   invest that I will pre-order on hardware, not know on a company that's never shipped hardware
[02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:24.720]   before. But I've loved their software and their, and also their Mac, their Mac software and their
[02:03:24.720 --> 02:03:29.680]   games so much that, that I knew that they would do something really, really interesting with this.
[02:03:29.680 --> 02:03:36.080]   And also, I like the idea behind it. It's also my idea of gaming. I really don't want a Nintendo
[02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:40.400]   Switch. I don't want this handheld that gives me $60 games that will spend me weeks and weeks and
[02:03:40.400 --> 02:03:44.480]   weeks to get through. I kind of want something that's trivially small that will be in my pocket
[02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:50.320]   that will give me diversion on little pocket games. And one of the things I liked about it was that,
[02:03:50.320 --> 02:03:54.160]   of course, the big question is, oh, it's a brand new game platform, but where are you going to get
[02:03:54.160 --> 02:03:59.760]   the games from? Well, they said that you buy this and you will get it. Basically, there will be a
[02:03:59.760 --> 02:04:05.840]   season, like a TV season of games that will automatically be sent to the device to every week.
[02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:10.640]   And as you can see, if it's a new week, and maybe you can see on the startup screen, it says,
[02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:17.360]   hey, there are new games available. So if I just, if so, if I wake her up and then just tap a button,
[02:04:17.360 --> 02:04:25.600]   see, there's a little gift box and I tap on that. Anyway, and so basically, the two new games this
[02:04:25.600 --> 02:04:30.560]   week will just simply download to my device and their and their and their rep. You don't know.
[02:04:30.560 --> 02:04:37.600]   Yeah. And Wi-Fi has Bluetooth. It's not a backlit screen, but it's a super, super, super high contrast,
[02:04:37.600 --> 02:04:41.920]   high definition black and white screen. So yeah, we won't, we won't work in the dark, but as long as
[02:04:41.920 --> 02:04:47.840]   there is some source of light in the room, I find that it's that's good. The games themselves,
[02:04:47.840 --> 02:04:52.640]   there, most of them have been very, very interesting and quirky. They're not designed to be
[02:04:52.640 --> 02:04:58.720]   part of a monologue joke the next day because on late night TV, because they're so popular,
[02:04:58.720 --> 02:05:04.720]   they're designed to give you amusement for hours or days. And they have been very, very unique in
[02:05:04.720 --> 02:05:09.520]   how well, how well they work. The only thing I will, the only complaint that I will make about it is
[02:05:09.520 --> 02:05:15.040]   that I dearly, dearly wish that as part of the developer docs that their developer docs are
[02:05:15.040 --> 02:05:20.640]   available on the play date site, I wish they said, please, please, please make your opening screens
[02:05:20.640 --> 02:05:25.600]   have documentation and explain how your game works. Because the only times that I've had the,
[02:05:25.600 --> 02:05:30.240]   I've had now six games, the only times I've had bad times with them is where there is just,
[02:05:30.240 --> 02:05:34.720]   they just drop you in. They are not going to tell you what the mechanic is. It's not the sort of game
[02:05:34.720 --> 02:05:39.440]   where part of the fun is figuring out what the mechanic is. It's where it knows what the rules
[02:05:39.440 --> 02:05:43.760]   are. It's not going to tell you what the rules are. And then it's going to humiliate you for making
[02:05:43.760 --> 02:05:49.440]   mistakes because you don't know what the rules are. And so at the very least, I wish that the
[02:05:49.440 --> 02:05:53.600]   developers of these games, which oh, by the way, here is, go to our website and we will explain,
[02:05:53.600 --> 02:05:58.560]   here's how you score points. Here's what we're expecting you to do with this game. That's the only,
[02:05:58.560 --> 02:06:04.720]   that's the only negative experience I've had with it. But as I have, as I had hoped and as I expected,
[02:06:04.720 --> 02:06:08.560]   it attracted a lot of very interesting and creative people to create games for this.
[02:06:08.560 --> 02:06:13.040]   You can also create your own games for it either through developing and sideloading your own games
[02:06:13.040 --> 02:06:18.160]   for the development kit that they provide, or there's a simple game creator that you can create
[02:06:18.160 --> 02:06:22.800]   through the web. I see, create your own games. There's already about 200, I think, third party
[02:06:22.800 --> 02:06:28.240]   games have been released for this. They can either buy through a game store or download for free and
[02:06:28.240 --> 02:06:32.080]   sideload. And apparently it's going to be a second season of games coming. I don't know if that's
[02:06:32.080 --> 02:06:38.400]   going to cost me any money or not. But as I said, I bought this. It's not super
[02:06:38.400 --> 02:06:46.640]   cheap. It's $179. But I figured that at a price per game of having an interesting piece of hardware
[02:06:46.640 --> 02:06:52.800]   and something that would get me something fun to play with when I'm waiting for a train or a bus,
[02:06:52.800 --> 02:06:58.480]   and another cute little adorable gadget to have. For me, that was a good price. If you're looking
[02:06:58.480 --> 02:07:06.720]   to spend $200 on interesting quirky gaming and you don't instinctively love this idea, there are
[02:07:06.720 --> 02:07:13.360]   other options out there. Evercade costs $150. It's a kind of like a Nintendo Switch that uses cartridges
[02:07:13.360 --> 02:07:20.560]   that are based on truly 1980s, 1990s, vintage games, whether Commerce 64 or Arcade. So that's
[02:07:20.560 --> 02:07:24.480]   not going to be for you. But if you really are the sort of person, wow, that really looks very,
[02:07:24.480 --> 02:07:28.960]   very interesting. And I'm looking for something that's kind of different and unique than I think
[02:07:28.960 --> 02:07:32.640]   you might be very, very happy with this. You're going to have to wait for it because they are,
[02:07:32.640 --> 02:07:38.240]   they are to their credit, panic is under promising and over delivering. They are being very,
[02:07:38.240 --> 02:07:43.440]   very upfront about the fact that we are making these in like 10,000 bad 10 units of 10,000 at a
[02:07:43.440 --> 02:07:47.920]   time. Here is this get here is when we believe we will be able to start shipping things and I'll
[02:07:47.920 --> 02:07:52.240]   be darned as soon as they said, whether they predicted when they would be start shipping wave
[02:07:52.240 --> 02:07:57.280]   three, my wave hardware. And that's exactly when they started ship. And they actually delivered more
[02:07:57.280 --> 02:08:02.640]   games with a subscription than they actually promised. So sit tight, it's going to take you
[02:08:02.640 --> 02:08:08.080]   food must to get it. But it's going to be it's a good fun. So you have one Jason has one. I'd ask
[02:08:08.080 --> 02:08:12.080]   you guys, you get tired of it after a while, you think it's kind of thing you play with for a
[02:08:12.080 --> 02:08:18.160]   little bit and then it gets in ends up in a drawer or no. I would I would say no, but then again,
[02:08:18.160 --> 02:08:23.120]   I've only had mine for like three weeks. I think that what it what it comes to ask me again,
[02:08:23.120 --> 02:08:27.680]   after I've had all 24 games and it's about a month later, these are games that are designed to
[02:08:27.680 --> 02:08:33.760]   give you side quests and downloadable extra content. That's that's that's Nintendo switch stuff.
[02:08:33.760 --> 02:08:38.560]   This is the sort of stuff where either it's it's a very it's a big variety. Either it's a very
[02:08:38.560 --> 02:08:42.960]   simple sort of like mobile style arcade game where you're going to have a lot of fun with it with a
[02:08:42.960 --> 02:08:46.960]   few days, then you'll feel as though you've done whatever you can with it to little adventure games
[02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:51.600]   that might take you like a week or two to get to the very, very end of it. But I do think it's this
[02:08:51.600 --> 02:08:56.240]   there are the sort of games you'll play for about a week, maybe two weeks, and then you're done with
[02:08:56.240 --> 02:09:02.080]   it, you put it away, but they're usually more games coming. And if that's why I did the financials
[02:09:02.080 --> 02:09:08.400]   on this based on if I were to be buy if I were buying games for my phone at a rate of like three
[02:09:08.400 --> 02:09:14.720]   dollars to four dollars each, would I buy these like 24 25 games? Actually a little more expensive
[02:09:14.720 --> 02:09:18.720]   than that, but that's on that basis and also because of a panics reputation for doing really
[02:09:18.720 --> 02:09:23.920]   cool things. I decided going on it. How about you, Jason? Where's your play date? Yeah, I
[02:09:23.920 --> 02:09:30.240]   so I got it in the first wave. So I've had it for a while. I think 24 games, there are just
[02:09:30.240 --> 02:09:34.400]   games in there. I have not even begun to scratch the surface. I'm not playing it as much as I used
[02:09:34.400 --> 02:09:40.880]   to, but I think that a lot of it is the fact that screen, I love that screen and I know why they
[02:09:40.880 --> 02:09:46.880]   made it the way they did. But the fact that it isn't backlit means you have to be in a context
[02:09:46.880 --> 02:09:51.680]   where you've got the play date, got time to play a game and are in a well lit location.
[02:09:51.680 --> 02:09:58.640]   And I don't find myself in that situation as much as I'd like. So when I do, there are some
[02:09:58.640 --> 02:10:04.640]   games that are very replayable on there. There's a sort of Asteroids S game that I absolutely love.
[02:10:04.640 --> 02:10:08.480]   There is a pattern matching game that is brilliant. I think what you end up after,
[02:10:08.480 --> 02:10:12.400]   you get your 24 games as you'll find like there are five that you're obsessed with.
[02:10:12.400 --> 02:10:17.840]   That's good. There are five that are five or 10 that are okay and five and 10 that didn't click
[02:10:17.840 --> 02:10:22.320]   for you. But in the end, I think it's supremely playable. Plus there are a bunch of third party
[02:10:22.320 --> 02:10:28.880]   games now. I just think that it's not a fatal flaw, but the biggest flaw about it is that
[02:10:28.880 --> 02:10:32.880]   because they went with a non-backlit screen, there are lots of contexts where I would play
[02:10:32.880 --> 02:10:38.400]   more games. And literally it's not bright enough. Under the covers at night.
[02:10:38.400 --> 02:10:44.080]   Well, even like in a room that you wouldn't say is poorly lit unless you were trying to read a book,
[02:10:44.080 --> 02:10:48.320]   it's the same kind of thing where you're like, wait a second, I got to turn on a light and I
[02:10:48.320 --> 02:10:53.600]   got to shine it at the right angle. So in a book, you can kind of angle and just hold the book,
[02:10:53.600 --> 02:10:58.640]   but this is a little gaming device. So you have to angle it and hold on to it and play the game.
[02:10:58.640 --> 02:11:06.480]   And it's just a little awkward. I hope they do another play in the future with a screen that does
[02:11:06.480 --> 02:11:09.280]   light up at some point because it would make it a lot more portable that way.
[02:11:09.280 --> 02:11:14.160]   Yeah. On the plus side, that makes the battery laps a lot longer.
[02:11:14.160 --> 02:11:15.600]   I agree. What's the battery like?
[02:11:15.600 --> 02:11:23.600]   By the way, 14 days standby, 8 hours active. I find that the way I play it, it lasts about a
[02:11:23.600 --> 02:11:28.400]   week for me because again, these are not, it's not like red dead redemption where it's like I'm
[02:11:28.400 --> 02:11:34.000]   going to be in story mode for four hours. That was another advantage to me for that. I don't like
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:38.880]   devices where I have to remember to keep charging it. I want it to be able to be, I can pick it up
[02:11:38.880 --> 02:11:44.080]   and take it and use it whenever I want to. The same reason why I like having my Walkman digital
[02:11:44.080 --> 02:11:50.560]   music player that it's not a complicated one. It's a very simple one, but the battery lasts like
[02:11:50.560 --> 02:11:55.520]   two or three or four weeks. And for that, it does what it does what it's meant to do as a,
[02:11:55.520 --> 02:12:01.600]   it is a device that will only play games for me. I pick it up for exactly that purpose and it does
[02:12:01.600 --> 02:12:06.880]   get to that purpose when I pick it up. I should say, very, very well made too. If you think about,
[02:12:06.880 --> 02:12:12.880]   that's from teenage engineering. Those guys are incredible. And they know that a game crank is
[02:12:12.880 --> 02:12:17.600]   probably going to get a lot of abuse. It's very, very solid metal. There are some games where you
[02:12:17.600 --> 02:12:22.000]   really have to crank it very, very fast and I'm no longer afraid of breaking the thing off.
[02:12:22.000 --> 02:12:30.480]   When it arrives, you will feel as though, okay, I get why this costs $179 and it's not like a $49
[02:12:30.480 --> 02:12:37.120]   thing at Bed Bath and Beyond. No, the panic, which is a great software company,
[02:12:37.120 --> 02:12:40.640]   outsourced the hardware to a company that really knows hardware. Yeah,
[02:12:40.640 --> 02:12:41.600]   image engineering. Yeah.
[02:12:41.600 --> 02:12:49.200]   A Jason's now pick of the week. I've got an IndyMac app for you. It is called RetroBatch. It's from
[02:12:49.200 --> 02:12:57.360]   flying meat software. Gus Muller over there, maker of Acorn. I love flying meat. RetroBatch
[02:12:57.360 --> 02:13:03.280]   is a $30. There's a $50 pro version. It's a $30 app and basically it's automation workflow for
[02:13:03.280 --> 02:13:10.720]   images. So if you're somebody who has to process lots of images, you can build fairly complicated.
[02:13:10.720 --> 02:13:16.640]   I'm actually, it's a nightledity. Yeah. So for my book about photos that I'm writing for the
[02:13:16.640 --> 02:13:22.800]   take control, they actually have a workflow for this that like, it's got like a bunch of rules.
[02:13:22.800 --> 02:13:27.440]   And then depending on the image, it drops a drop shadow and it changes the margins and then it
[02:13:27.440 --> 02:13:33.040]   writes the images out. And you can have very sophisticated workflows that you build and you can set up
[02:13:33.040 --> 02:13:38.720]   droplets. So you drag some an image in and it processes and takes it to its destination. It's
[02:13:38.720 --> 02:13:43.680]   one of those things that again, it's it's Nishi. You got to be somebody who is batch processing
[02:13:43.680 --> 02:13:48.960]   images. But if you work on the web, if you work in software development, they're, you know, or
[02:13:48.960 --> 02:13:56.240]   writing books, whatever it is, I find myself pulling out retro batch, you know, it's only
[02:13:56.240 --> 02:14:00.800]   a handful of times a year. But what ends up happening is I look at something and I go,
[02:14:00.800 --> 02:14:05.920]   Oh, no, this is going to take me forever. And then I think it won't because I'm going to set up a
[02:14:05.920 --> 02:14:13.760]   quick retro batch and drag my hundred files in. And in 30 seconds, it's done. So it's a really
[02:14:13.760 --> 02:14:18.960]   great app. You know, if you need it, right, if you need to, if I said, Bass process images and
[02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:24.560]   you're like, well, that's me. Why have you not gotten retro batch already? Check it out. So there's a
[02:14:24.560 --> 02:14:30.160]   regular version for 30 bucks and a pro version for 50. Yeah, that adds a bunch of scripting stuff
[02:14:30.160 --> 02:14:35.200]   and really super nerdy stuff if you if you need that level of control over it. But it's just, I mean,
[02:14:35.200 --> 02:14:39.200]   if you think about it, it's just it's a really quick automation for images. If you're somebody who
[02:14:39.200 --> 02:14:44.160]   has got a bunch of images that you want to save out in order to put somewhere and it needs to be a
[02:14:44.160 --> 02:14:48.880]   certain size that it needs to be in a certain JPEG format or whatever, like you add in a couple
[02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:54.800]   of nodes really fast and then drag your files and then press go. And it like instantly spits out
[02:14:54.800 --> 02:14:59.440]   all of the results. It's and you can set how it's how they're named and where they go. And like,
[02:14:59.440 --> 02:15:05.520]   it's it really is quite remarkable. It's a great app. A lot of the backend stuff of Acorn is
[02:15:06.240 --> 02:15:10.080]   built into their I imagine. Yeah, this is basically Acorn automation happening here.
[02:15:10.080 --> 02:15:16.880]   Yeah, really cool. Wow. And of course, we've been recommending Acorn for years, maybe decades.
[02:15:16.880 --> 02:15:24.720]   Flying meat dot com. Well, that's it for this episode of Mac break weekly. If I might,
[02:15:24.720 --> 02:15:32.400]   I'd like to entice you into joining our club increasingly looks like the best way to do an
[02:15:32.400 --> 02:15:37.600]   independent podcast network is to have the listeners support it and your support is very
[02:15:37.600 --> 02:15:42.640]   much appreciated. What do you get? It's not much seven bucks a month, actually less than Twitter
[02:15:42.640 --> 02:15:48.720]   blue and you get a whole lot more all the shows that we do add free. And by the way,
[02:15:48.720 --> 02:15:52.800]   shows you don't hear anywhere else are on the Twi plus feed like our hands on Mac. My
[02:15:52.800 --> 02:15:57.920]   cusargent does that every week. Hands on windows with Paul Therat, the untitled Linux show Stacey's
[02:15:57.920 --> 02:16:02.880]   book club, the Gizfiz and more we launch shows from the club like this week in space,
[02:16:02.880 --> 02:16:10.640]   supported by our club members. But I think for many of us, the best part of club to it is the
[02:16:10.640 --> 02:16:18.160]   exclusive private club in our discord. I love hanging in the discord. It's the really the best
[02:16:18.160 --> 02:16:25.600]   social network you'd ever see. And that's part of your membership. So please, if you haven't
[02:16:25.600 --> 02:16:30.880]   considered this yet, I think it'd be a great thing to do as a holiday gift for the nerd in your life.
[02:16:30.880 --> 02:16:38.960]   Twit.tv/club. Twit.tv/club. There are annual memberships, monthly memberships,
[02:16:38.960 --> 02:16:43.920]   and corporate memberships. Plus, all the shows that we do support by ads are available ad-free
[02:16:43.920 --> 02:16:48.160]   individually for $2.99 a month. All of that is at the website.
[02:16:49.040 --> 02:16:57.120]   Twit.tv/club or club twit or club twit.tv or any permutation thereof.
[02:16:57.120 --> 02:17:04.720]   Thank you so much, Andy Ennaco. When are you going to be on GBH next Thursday at 1230,
[02:17:04.720 --> 02:17:12.000]   go to wgphnews.org, stream it live or later or go to the WGBH channel on YouTube, also to stream
[02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:18.720]   it live or later. Thank you, Andy. See you next week. Alex Lindsey is at officehours.global.
[02:17:19.440 --> 02:17:22.960]   That is the place to go. If you want to know about pretty much anything,
[02:17:22.960 --> 02:17:28.480]   you can participate in their morning Zoom calls. You can see all their stuff after the fact that
[02:17:28.480 --> 02:17:32.880]   officehours.global.com. I want to do this. You were doing the stream deck.
[02:17:32.880 --> 02:17:37.120]   Stream deck. Whole hour on stream deck. We're just starting to scratch the surface.
[02:17:37.120 --> 02:17:40.000]   I didn't realize we could switch the tri-caster with the screen.
[02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:44.240]   Stream deck. As you can see, you can just stack them up. You can just keep on adding more
[02:17:44.240 --> 02:17:51.680]   stream decks. We were some power users talking about stream deck and companion and central control
[02:17:51.680 --> 02:17:56.400]   and how they all integrate and how to make them work. Yesterday, we were talking about
[02:17:56.400 --> 02:18:03.360]   Zoom Iso. We're talking about a lot of power users. We're talking about that too.
[02:18:03.360 --> 02:18:08.400]   And then tomorrow, we have a Foley artist.
[02:18:09.200 --> 02:18:14.240]   Focus on Foley. I'm talking about Foley. It's going to be great. He's like, "Greg is amazing."
[02:18:14.240 --> 02:18:19.360]   He worked on a lot of feature films. He's going to talk about that. It's just every day.
[02:18:19.360 --> 02:18:23.680]   On Thursday, focus on masterful interviewing. That sounds like...
[02:18:23.680 --> 02:18:27.520]   Yeah. I'll be interested to see what you think. You're pretty good at it.
[02:18:27.520 --> 02:18:33.920]   Well, I have a lot to learn. It's hard to... That's a skill that you get better at as you do it.
[02:18:33.920 --> 02:18:38.800]   Thank you, Alex. And of course, if you want to hire Alex and his team for your next
[02:18:39.440 --> 02:18:45.360]   video stream or production or conference, 090.media is the place to go.
[02:18:45.360 --> 02:18:52.320]   Jason Snell is the man in charge of six colors. Get his color graphs and a whole lot more great
[02:18:52.320 --> 02:18:59.280]   apple coverage, six colors.com. He's also a masterful. Dare I say, incomparable podcaster.
[02:18:59.280 --> 02:19:07.840]   Vincompable.com, a whole network of shows that spun out of the pop culture podcast I do every
[02:19:07.840 --> 02:19:14.880]   week and some more over at really.fm too for tech podcast-y sort of stuff. But six colors,
[02:19:14.880 --> 02:19:18.720]   it's all linked to from six colors.com. It's easy to remember. Just go there.
[02:19:18.720 --> 02:19:21.600]   Yeah. I made him make a podcast page.
[02:19:21.600 --> 02:19:23.440]   Yeah. You did it.
[02:19:23.440 --> 02:19:28.640]   Sixcolors.com/podcasts because he has so dang many of them.
[02:19:28.640 --> 02:19:34.720]   Yeah. Check out Robot or Not this week. John Syracuse and I talked about zombie robot spiders.
[02:19:35.440 --> 02:19:41.520]   That was fun. What is a robot or not? It's not a robot. So, spoiler alert for robot or not.
[02:19:41.520 --> 02:19:46.800]   It's not an undead zombie spider robot is not a robot. It's just a dead spider being controlled
[02:19:46.800 --> 02:19:52.720]   by people. Well, that's what you say. And we did a werewolves episode where somebody prompted us,
[02:19:52.720 --> 02:19:58.480]   who's like an expert on werewolves apparently self-appointed. And the good news is they approved
[02:19:58.480 --> 02:20:02.080]   of our episode because that's the scary thing, right? Is there like, I would like you to rule
[02:20:02.080 --> 02:20:07.440]   one whether this is whether werewolves or I think that question was, are you a werewolf all the time
[02:20:07.440 --> 02:20:14.560]   or are you only a werewolf when you're a wolf? And I forget what we ruled, but we were told we
[02:20:14.560 --> 02:20:19.040]   were told we were correctly. So that was a good question. Not a long show. Five minutes, but...
[02:20:19.040 --> 02:20:22.560]   Oh no. It's an anti-podcast. Everything. It's like two, three, four, five minutes.
[02:20:22.560 --> 02:20:28.720]   Sometimes the theme song is the longest part. It's great fun. It's me and John Syracuse deciding.
[02:20:29.520 --> 02:20:33.760]   John, I ask him and he rules on whether something is something or not.
[02:20:33.760 --> 02:20:38.640]   It's the hors d'oeuvre of podcasts, the amoose bush to listen to before you begin your
[02:20:38.640 --> 02:20:43.680]   big meal, which is... That's right. That's right. I do a lot of 90 minute long podcasts and I do one
[02:20:43.680 --> 02:20:50.960]   that's four minutes long. It's great. You should name it a moose bush, frankly. Thank you, Jason.
[02:20:50.960 --> 02:20:55.280]   Thank you, Andy. Thank you, Alex. Thank you all for listening to Do Macbree quickly.
[02:20:55.280 --> 02:21:00.640]   Tuesdays 11 a.m. Pacific 2 p.m. Eastern. We are going back to standard time on Sunday.
[02:21:00.640 --> 02:21:08.240]   So the next time you hear us, we will be at 1900 UTC. You can figure out what that means in your
[02:21:08.240 --> 02:21:14.400]   local jurisdiction. I say that so you can watch live or listen live at live.twit.tv.
[02:21:14.400 --> 02:21:20.080]   Chat live at IRC.twit.tv. We're in the club Twit Discord. You could download shows at your own
[02:21:20.080 --> 02:21:28.800]   convenience any old time UTC from the website Twit.tv/mbw or YouTube, where we have all the shows in
[02:21:28.800 --> 02:21:34.640]   video, format, and of course, probably the easiest thing to do is to get pocket casts or
[02:21:34.640 --> 02:21:40.080]   overcast or Apple podcasts or Google or whatever your favorite podcast client is and subscribe.
[02:21:40.080 --> 02:21:44.560]   That way you'll get it automatically. The minute it's available on a Tuesday evening.
[02:21:44.560 --> 02:21:50.000]   Thank you all for being here. Now get back to work because break time is over. Bye bye.
[02:21:50.880 --> 02:21:56.960]   Hey there, I'm Mike Asargent from Twit and you may be asking a question. What in the world do you
[02:21:56.960 --> 02:22:04.160]   do if you want to think that hard working team of yours? Well, why not give them a club Twit
[02:22:04.160 --> 02:22:09.200]   corporate subscription? Oh, and here's a secret. You'll be benefiting yourself too because you
[02:22:09.200 --> 02:22:14.160]   will be able to keep your team informed and entertained with podcasts covering the latest in tech.
[02:22:14.160 --> 02:22:18.400]   So, we'll always stay up to date. With a club Twit subscription, they're going to get access to
[02:22:18.400 --> 02:22:23.600]   all of our podcasts ad-free. Look at access to the members only Discord server where they can chat
[02:22:23.600 --> 02:22:28.880]   with fellow club Twit members and all of us here at Twit and exclusive shows like Hands on Mac,
[02:22:28.880 --> 02:22:36.560]   Hands on Windows, and the Untitled Linux Show. Go to twit.tv/clubtwit and look for corporate plans
[02:22:36.560 --> 02:22:48.240]   for complete details.
