[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.880]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show where
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.320]   we talk about Macintosh stuff.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.680]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.480]   And with me in studio today, the lovely and talented Alex
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.160]   Lindsey from the pixelcore.com.
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.160]   Hello, Alex.
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.960]   Good to see you.
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.160]   And also via Skype from his home in Boston, Mass.
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.720]   Thereabouts the environs Andy and Notco from the Chicago
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.480]   Sun Times.
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.560]   Hey, Andy.
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.720]   Hello, video listeners at home.
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.200]   Video listeners at home.
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.080]   I don't even know what that means.
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.160]   Well, because we want to ostracize the people
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.560]   who are goofing off at work, listening
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.120]   to them watching this podcast when they should be producing
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.880]   money and currency and value for our entire economy.
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:55.880]   We need you.
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.320]   You are.
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.960]   That's right.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.120]   Don't be a lazy bones.
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.560]   Get to work.
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.560]   And then spend it.
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.480]   And then spend it as quickly as you can on Apple Goods.
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.120]   So the aftermath of Macworld Expo, how do you all feel?
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.080]   Little hungover, a little tired, a little disappointed.
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.120]   I'm still alive.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.360]   I was near death after the last Macworld.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.040]   You remember we really killed ourselves last time.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.800]   Yeah, that was a little too much.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.680]   But I think it seemed like a little bit of a lighter
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.840]   show, a lot lighter to me.
[00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.160]   Smaller audience, right?
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.320]   It seemed like-- I don't think we've seen numbers yet.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.000]   So I don't know what the numbers were,
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.720]   but it did feel like it was less crowded.
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.280]   But I wasn't there the first couple of days.
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.680]   I mean, we were recording and doing a lot of other things.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.080]   Yeah.
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.680]   How about you, Andy?
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.400]   What was your feeling about it?
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.320]   Well, it shouldn't be that surprising that turnout was lower.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.200]   I understand that numbers from CES were lower as well.
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.840]   So there's certainly a certain out of a bad economy
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:52.720]   effect going on.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.200]   Yeah.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.160]   Plus, I'm sure there's a lot of people who want to just rest
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.680]   up for the big Obama, inaugural or whatever.
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.880]   It was a good-- it was a solid show,
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.080]   but it does sort of remind you of what
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.560]   a big effect a huge stirring Apple announcement has
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.520]   on the rest of the week when every--
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.160]   the first topic of conversation is always,
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:14.800]   did you see the new iPhone yet?
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.520]   Or have you gotten that special multi-chip tattoo that
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.280]   lets the new iMac sense your movements throughout the world?
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.680]   I want the big click wheel back.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.040]   That onion thing was so funny.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.960]   Oh, man, was that good.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.520]   So you're right.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.520]   And I was kind of of the opinion, Andy,
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.520]   that at first that, oh, no big deal,
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.120]   Apple could pull out of this without any harm to Apple.
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.480]   Apple made the case that, well, we don't need to be there.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.760]   It's a bad time for us to announce new products.
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.640]   Trade shows aren't what they used to be.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.400]   But after this, I kind of feel like Apple might suffer
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.680]   a little bit from it.
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.160]   Well, one of the things that I brought up,
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.040]   I think, in the town hall meeting that Mackerel had
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.600]   was that I really think that this is the nucleus
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.200]   of the Apple community.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.640]   It's not the entire--
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.640]   It's still there.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.360]   Well, the thing is is that these are the bloggers,
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.760]   the press, the participants who really are the ones who are--
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.080]   they're the ones telling their friends.
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.440]   They're the ones that are online.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.880]   And being able to have a unified exposure to them,
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.080]   not only for Apple, but for the Apple--
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.960]   for the Apple software developers and everything else,
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.480]   having that unified way to get ahold of everybody,
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:27.760]   I think makes a big difference.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.880]   And I don't think you can do it just in Apple stores.
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.080]   I agree.
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.320]   And I think that there's something
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.840]   about having this big event that galvanizes the community
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.080]   and stirs up interest.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.440]   And even if it's not a good time to make an announcement,
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.840]   you need to throw a little bone out there.
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.360]   And I think it's--
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.280]   I'll give you an example.
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.640]   I think these-- what is it?
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:52.480]   What do you think it is?
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.920]   10,000, 20,000, 30,000 people come to Macworld?
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:57.120]   Oh, well, it's typically between 40, 50,000.
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.680]   I think it was probably 35 to 40,000.
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.080]   Those are the nucleus of Apple's cult of Mac
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.280]   all over the world.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.680]   I think so.
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.480]   You need to keep them--
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.880]   I think getting them together once a year
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:06.920]   ain't a bad idea at all.
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.760]   Andy, what do you think?
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.400]   Well, I think this is a good chance
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.800]   to demonstrate whether the community is Apple
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:13.800]   and whatever they tell us to do,
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.640]   or whether the community can stand on its own.
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.560]   And if Macworld continues to go on without Apple,
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.160]   that's a good statement that we're not just mindless sheep who
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.640]   need the bright, shiny objects with the Apple logos on them.
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.400]   But I think the key to continuing the show
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.640]   and making it a winner is emphasizing the community aspect,
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.960]   that it is a case of people with like-minded goals
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.480]   and the same sort of thinking about what they expect out
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:39.120]   of their technology, finding one big room that
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.520]   has all the stuff that they're liable to be interested in all
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.080]   in one place.
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.000]   They said at the town--
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.760]   I wasn't at the town hall.
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:47.720]   I missed it, unfortunately.
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.680]   But didn't they say, Alex, that David Pogue was going
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.720]   to do the keynote next year?
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:51.920]   Yeah.
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:52.640]   The on keynote.
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.800]   He did the on keynote at the last Mac world Boston, right?
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.000]   I think so.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.400]   So this is a tradition.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:00.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:01.880]   It didn't turn out so well there.
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.640]   So hopefully it'll--
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.720]   I think the tradition is that he does the first keynote.
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.560]   I do the second one.
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.440]   And then after that, the third year,
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.600]   they decide not to do it anymore.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.040]   Oh, you did the keynote on the last Mac world Boston?
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.640]   I delivered the keynote of death at two shows that year
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.280]   in both years.
[00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.640]   It was the exact same keynote and the last year
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.280]   for that respective 10, 20 year long.
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.520]   Don't blame yourself, Andy.
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.800]   Really, don't blame yourself.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.240]   It's not your fault.
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.560]   So many other people will.
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.160]   You don't have to blame yourself.
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.760]   They will for you.
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:30.760]   Yeah, I mean, I just--
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.520]   I don't know if we can have a community event that really
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.840]   galvanizes people without the involvement of Apple.
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:37.320]   Sure we can.
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.080]   There was a really-- you think we can?
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.760]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.120]   OK.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.160]   Like I said, we're a community of users.
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:45.720]   Mac world was a big event before Apple really got involved.
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.560]   People tend to forget that.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.360]   And the key is going to be trying to figure out
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.120]   whether or not we are an event of that kind of importance.
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.160]   If we're just a good place for Apple to make a huge announcement
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.760]   and then three days of reactions to that announcement,
[00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.160]   or if once again, we are a community that
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:06.360]   can really amuse ourselves without mom and dad's involvement.
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.880]   What do they do wrong after Mac world Boston and Mac
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:09.880]   world New York?
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.560]   What should IDG, which runs this conference,
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.200]   do differently this time, to keep this going?
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:15.960]   Really?
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.120]   I think they should treat this like the Great London Fire.
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:22.760]   I mean, it's not the result that one would have wanted,
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.840]   but when you wipe the slate clean,
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.680]   you get to rebuild this city in the world that
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.880]   exists in today, as opposed to dealing with all the flossman
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.880]   jetsum of what it used to be 20 years ago.
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.880]   If you were to build a really big conference today,
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.880]   you wouldn't do it like a 1985 trade show.
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.760]   You would simply say, we want to put in a environment where
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:45.560]   people want to get together and talk about the stuff
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:46.600]   they'd seen.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.200]   Do an unconference.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.640]   Well, it would be very, very familiar,
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:53.240]   but you'd have things like, one of the things I think
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:57.680]   I'm disappointed with the way that some of the best panels
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.480]   and the best talks are set up is that they're set up in.
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.000]   There's a separate area of the event
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.200]   where you have to go in order to see a panel or to see a talk.
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:10.200]   I would have an open floor plan where you're just walking around
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:12.720]   and you just happen to over hear a really great discussion
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.120]   happening on the state.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.960]   And not only that, but there's also tables and open areas
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.920]   where people who have just heard David Poe talk about whatever
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.800]   can talk about what they've just heard and think about,
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:23.800]   oh, jade, did you hear that?
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.600]   There's going to be another session on Final Cut.
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:28.400]   I've always wondered what the difference was between the two.
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.560]   Let's go to that session next.
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.360]   I think that there was a conference
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.920]   that I rarely used to do, the Mac Dev Conference,
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:38.280]   that had a lot of really great ideas.
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:41.920]   And it mostly being that the full Chrome of the event
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.320]   wasn't those conference rooms.
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.160]   It was the common areas in the hotel
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.920]   where you would meet and mingle between those panels.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.920]   And I think that that's going to have to be the nucleus
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:51.120]   of the new Mac world expo.
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.560]   That could be a really exciting event to go to.
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:57.240]   Craig Severson does a conference in Hawaii called LobbyCon.
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.440]   It's based on that idea that's a lobby,
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.280]   the most important part of it.
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.200]   And the Marad didn't even know they were hosting a conference
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.040]   that weekend.
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.040]   That's a surprise.
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.240]   All they know is that it's selling a lot of beer,
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.280]   so they're happy.
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.520]   Well, I think we all talk to Paul Kent,
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.640]   the guy who has been for what, 20 years now,
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:16.440]   organizing a Mac world expo for IDG.
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.640]   And he's really anxious to keep it going.
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.200]   It must have been a kick in the stomach
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.400]   when the rumor circulated,
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.760]   I don't know if true or false that Apple
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.440]   might be at CES next year.
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.960]   Do you think that's Alex, is that possible?
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.680]   It is possible.
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:35.000]   I mean, if Apple is really looking at its own,
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.840]   we want to move to being a consumer company.
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.560]   We want to be a consumer product company.
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:43.560]   And CES is trying to build an Apple-centric area
[00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:45.320]   within CES next year.
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:47.240]   Obviously, they're going straight at Apple.
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:51.720]   They have a lot of Mac world vendors.
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:54.480]   Which, and I think that in the short term,
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.720]   in the short term for the vendors,
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.200]   it might make sense in the long term.
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.320]   I think they'll just get swallowed up by CES.
[00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:00.160]   It won't make any--
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.000]   It's too big of a show.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.560]   And the thing is, is that it just,
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.280]   they'll lose out by letting a conference
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:06.960]   that was really dedicated to them.
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.280]   You lose a sense of community.
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.400]   I think it would be a big mistake for vendors
[00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:13.200]   to go down that path.
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.160]   Ryan Block, we talked to him on Twitter on Sunday,
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.280]   said, "Absolutely not."
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:17.360]   He said, "That's a bogus rumor."
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.520]   There's no either, formerly even--
[00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:20.840]   I think Apple's just moving away from trade shows.
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.280]   They don't really want to do trade shows.
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.560]   I think that they don't feel like they need
[00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:24.640]   to do the trade shows anymore.
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.240]   And I know that they pulled out of NAB,
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.440]   which is another big show.
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.720]   And they, I don't think they--
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:31.720]   They only have any research.
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.200]   No, WWDC, right?
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.200]   And that's their own show.
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.200]   Right.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.200]   Do you-- any credence to that rumor
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.680]   that they might go to CES, Andy?
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.280]   I don't believe that.
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.640]   I think that they presented a really good case
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:45.240]   for why they didn't want to be involved in Macworld Expo.
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.640]   And the same reasons why, from their perspective,
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.440]   there's no upside to being at Macworld
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.960]   also would apply to CES.
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.280]   So unless there's a lot of stuff that we absolutely
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:58.600]   don't know about, or Apple's just big fat stinking liars
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.880]   whose lying mouths are full of lies,
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.880]   but that only tell lies.
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:05.360]   Which they have been in the past sometimes, yes?
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.080]   I think they're lying--
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.160]   they can be lying liars whose mouths are full of lies,
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.320]   but they're not lying liars whose lying mouths are full of lies
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.240]   that only tell lies.
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.800]   Is that one?
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.960]   It's a subtle distinction, but important.
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.200]   In the end, Apple will do stuff that's really
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.520]   in Apple's best interests.
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.680]   I don't see that exhibiting--
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.040]   I don't see how trading Macworld Expo, an event
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.440]   where they have everybody's attention, not just
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.840]   the 50,000 people in the room, but the--
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.200]   the entire world's attention, and being yet another press
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.200]   release from-- of the thousands of press releases coming off
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:40.600]   of CES, and I absolutely don't see how Apple would volunteer
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.840]   to have to be the opening act or the closing act
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.600]   to a Steve Ballmer keynote.
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.600]   I absolutely don't see--
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:46.240]   That won't happen.
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.480]   But that might be the kind of deal,
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:49.680]   but the brilliant negotiator Steve Jobs
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.040]   might make with CES, right?
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.160]   I mean, Steve--
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.640]   You can't-- Microsoft can't show,
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:54.320]   and you can't even talk about--
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.360]   Well, maybe--
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:55.960]   Well, we start.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.520]   Maybe Steve Jobs has keynote.
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:58.240]   Maybe a keynote.
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:58.720]   Maybe a keynote.
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:11:59.720]   Maybe a star's the show.
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:02.000]   Maybe-- and the thing is, is Apple's booth
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.200]   would dominate CES from a perception error?
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.880]   They're more of a very super electronic company
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.560]   than-- well, maybe not, but they're--
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:12.200]   I think they would attract a lot of people to their booth
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.760]   that haven't been there before.
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.600]   I think-- and in that case, it would be good,
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.480]   but I think that Apple was moving away from--
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.480]   They would piss off trade change.
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:18.720]   Trade change.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.240]   They'd be so thoroughly if they did that.
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.680]   I think it would just be such a risky thing.
[00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.120]   And I do think that there's an opportunity--
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.640]   I really think there's an opportunity for Macworld to--
[00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:28.520]   or IDG-- to not only rethink what
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.520]   Macworld looks like, but rethink how conferences work,
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:34.600]   completely, and look at what's working across all of these things.
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.080]   Conferences are kind of history.
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:36.600]   I think--
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.040]   See you got it.
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:39.040]   Go ahead.
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.440]   I'm just saying, again, the Great London Fire,
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:42.480]   it killed a lot of people.
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.720]   It destroyed a lot of-- a huge amount of the city.
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:47.080]   But it had two really great unintentional side effects,
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.280]   which is that it stopped the Black Death.
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.760]   And London was the first city to actually not
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.000]   have that problem solved.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.520]   Also, it allowed them to relay out the entire city
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:56.680]   and design all the streets.
[00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:59.280]   So it could still contain commercial traffic.
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:00.800]   Whereas every other city in Europe
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.960]   was still designed for horses pulling carts.
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.440]   That's one of the reasons why London became an international
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.000]   city really quickly after that.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.160]   Apple pulling out is the great London fire of Macworld Expo
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:12.720]   trade shows.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.200]   It leaves the ground empty and level
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:17.160]   and allows us to build something brand new to be ready
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.480]   for the 21st century.
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:19.520]   Big opportunity.
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:21.280]   Yeah.
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:21.680]   All right.
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.040]   So in retrospect, the announcement's
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.920]   Apple made at CES.
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.080]   I'm going to throw something out.
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.760]   I think you might have said this Andy actually
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.880]   at Macbroke Weekly last week, our live show.
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.800]   The more I think about it, the more iTunes Plus
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.880]   is the big announcement of the show.
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.520]   It was the one they kind of left for last.
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.520]   But holy cow, I mean, that really--
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:42.520]   throw it for one thing.
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.520]   It gets rid of a lot of ammunition people
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:46.960]   have against Apple for being a monopoly,
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.840]   because that iPod monopoly is broken.
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.680]   Honestly, I was very surprised that the record companies would
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:54.160]   allow that deal to happen.
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.720]   They-- it really shows you how desperate they were
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.840]   to get that variable pricing structure, how much they
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:03.760]   wanted that extra $0.29 per track at the very, very top end
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:08.560]   for them to give back the one big stick they had against Apple,
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.600]   which is, look, we are going to basically, emphatically,
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.760]   state that there's a reason for the Amazon MP3 store to exist.
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.440]   And that is that this will be the one place
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:19.600]   that we will allow people to buy nothing but un-glocked--
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:20.680]   un-protected songs.
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:21.680]   I like that.
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:24.480]   DRM, the glocking of your songs.
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.400]   I haven't read to which Corey Doctor I absolutely think
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.600]   glocked.
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.200]   I have to say that I was reading on Friend Feed.
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:35.200]   Somebody was saying, yeah, I'm not going to pay the Apple tax.
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.920]   I hate Apple, because they're lying liars in their marketing
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:38.600]   and stuff.
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.840]   And somebody said, yeah, but you've got to remember,
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:45.440]   Amazon Store wouldn't even exist had Apple not dug the groundwork
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.160]   with the iTunes store.
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.920]   Well, and I still think-- I think that the issue is that Amazon
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:54.080]   has had the advantage of being DRM-free, 256-bit.
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:55.080]   They do not have--
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.000]   And they still have number one.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.040]   They're number four or five.
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:57.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.640]   Apple still has 70% of the market.
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:00.720]   So they had this advantage.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:04.080]   But for people like me, I still believe that the iTunes
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:08.760]   interface is by-- the iTunes buying experience is still two
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.560]   or three times as good as the Amazon buying experience.
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:12.320]   I'm with you in the sense that I'm going back.
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.000]   Yeah, that's it.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.760]   I mean, I was buying everything on Amazon.
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:16.920]   I moved over to Amazon and just--
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:18.280]   I always go there first.
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:20.800]   I even fell for the sucker shill game
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:24.640]   that I'm a little pissed off at Apple for, of doing the upgrade.
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:26.240]   Because it's an all or nothing upgrade, you know?
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.280]   It's 30 cents per song.
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.120]   And it's everything you've ever bought.
[00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.400]   It's not even what's in your library.
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:33.720]   Because I bought-- yeah.
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:34.560]   Do you--
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:36.080]   You're a little surprised, are you?
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.160]   Do you?
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.840]   Because I bought-- well, let's give you an example.
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:40.400]   I did Regis and Kelly two years ago,
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:44.240]   and I bought Regis Philbin's album to demonstrate an iPod.
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.120]   Yeah, in order to upgrade everything else,
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:50.640]   I have to upgrade the Regis Philbin album for 30 cents a cut.
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:53.200]   And there's no option to opt out.
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.200]   It's all or nothing.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.120]   Right.
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.520]   That's a little-- maybe that.
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:59.520]   And he was what they said to the record companies,
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:01.280]   think of all the revenue.
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.240]   Think of all the money you'll make.
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:05.080]   Well, and I think that it had to happen.
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.520]   And I think that-- I don't think Apple--
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:09.280]   this was always-- people talk about Apple giving up DRM.
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.000]   I don't think Apple ever wanted the DRM there.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:11.520]   It wasn't--
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:12.800]   No, I think that's pretty clear.
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.400]   You know, I think that the ever--
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.960]   Well, no, OK.
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.000]   I might demure on that, because think about it.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.880]   Apple, the DRM-- what the DRM did is lock people into iPods.
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:23.480]   You could say--
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:24.640]   Yeah, people wanted the iPods anyway.
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.680]   Yeah, but the iPod iTunes connection--
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.280]   I mean, this is what the European Union said--
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.040]   is very monopolistic.
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.880]   You've got to have one to have the other.
[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.080]   People want either one.
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:34.520]   They're going to participate in the other one.
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:35.760]   It's very monopolistic.
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:37.720]   I think part of the reason Apple wanted this to happen
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.800]   is because sooner or later, they were going to--
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:41.680]   they're already in France and some other countries
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:42.920]   that are getting in trouble for this.
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:45.400]   But I think that the people-- if you have an iPod
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:50.280]   and you get iTunes installed, what other software
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:52.760]   would you use for your iPod?
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.680]   And if you had iTunes-- I mean, I have a hard time.
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.680]   I mean, I see people with other--
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:58.440]   I have treatment.
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.680]   I see people with other iPods.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:03.000]   I mean, other than iPods and other MB3 players.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:03.520]   Shit.
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:04.440]   It's like your head.
[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.240]   It's just like-- I don't see it very often.
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:06.920]   That's the whole thing.
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.320]   At least in California, you see somebody
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:12.360]   with something other than an iPod about once a month.
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:13.600]   I know.
[00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:14.760]   I don't think you're--
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:17.480]   I think your love for Apple products
[00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:20.040]   blinds you to the fact that this was pretty monopolistic.
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.840]   Well, I didn't want to buy an iPod when it first came out.
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:23.120]   And I did lots and lots of research.
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:24.160]   And it doesn't matter that it's better.
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:26.040]   It's anti-competitive whether it's better or not.
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.480]   I mean, it succeeds because it's very good.
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.400]   But I think this--
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.360]   But I think without the DRM, it'll continue to succeed.
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:32.040]   Well, it will now because they got to momentum.
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:32.320]   Right.
[00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:33.560]   They got what they wanted.
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:34.800]   How do you feel about that?
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:35.320]   Yeah, no.
[00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:37.640]   I mean, I think one of the big game changers here
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:40.680]   is the popularity of the Blackberry.
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.040]   On the one hand, I'm prepared to say,
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.080]   well, I don't really care that much about DRM
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:46.800]   because all the products that I choose to use for a media
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:49.040]   are Apologos or doesn't affect me that much.
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:51.760]   But if I were one of those people who prefers the Blackberry,
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.120]   I would be pretty cheesed off.
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:57.440]   That would send me screaming to the Amazon MP3 store.
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:58.640]   And this is a very big deal.
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:03.320]   In general, DRM was very, very important in that online music
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.320]   sales would not have happened without DRM.
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.440]   You'd have nothing but--
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:07.680]   There are labels with a gun there.
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:08.680]   Yeah.
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:10.280]   You'd have nothing but independent artists.
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:10.880]   And they're great.
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.880]   But there's very weird--
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:16.320]   You won't be able to find the album you want in the format
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.680]   that you want in an open format.
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:21.240]   But obviously, this is the situation we're in right now
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:22.600]   that we don't need it anymore.
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:24.400]   I think there's enough metrics and enough numbers
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.680]   demonstrating that DRM is a hindrance to consumer sales
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.360]   and not a help to consumer sales.
[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.720]   That piracy is going to happen whether things are unlocked
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:32.240]   or not.
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.880]   And you may as well, if you're a music seller,
[00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.040]   take the money from anybody who's willing to give it to you.
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:39.280]   And they want to give it to you if you sell unlocked
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:40.080]   unprotected tracks.
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:44.160]   Guess whose music store the new Palm Pre uses?
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.600]   It's Amazon.
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.560]   Built into the Palm Pre, it comes with the Palm Pre.
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:52.440]   How old do we think the Palm Pre is really going to do?
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:55.600]   The jury's going to be out until we see it.
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.560]   I think you felt the same way, Andy, about the Blackberry
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:57.920]   Storm.
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:59.320]   It looked really great on paper.
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:00.480]   We were very excited about it.
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:03.680]   Then it came out and was like, oh.
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.440]   And so the same thing could happen with the Pre.
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:09.480]   But remember, that's John Rubenstein, the guy who
[00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:11.320]   created the iPod, essentially.
[00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:13.640]   It's many of the iPhone designers.
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:17.760]   These guys, they rated Apple for these guys.
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:21.960]   In some ways, you could say this might be iPhone 2.0.
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:24.120]   I think it's going to be very interesting to see.
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:26.440]   I'll be the first in line to get one.
[00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:27.520]   It could be an iPhone killer.
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.880]   It's got a real keyboard.
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:33.440]   Like the iPhone, you can't upgrade the memory, which is odd
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:33.920]   nowadays.
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.640]   And most phones, you can put a memory card.
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:37.000]   In fact, they've announced they're
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.960]   going to get up to two terabytes on these little chips
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:40.280]   that go in phones.
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:42.040]   Oh my gosh.
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:42.920]   You can't do that.
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:45.480]   It's an 8 gigabyte phone, at least the first Pre.
[00:19:45.480 --> 00:19:47.960]   And they say they're going to make many of them.
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:51.000]   But unlike the iPhone, it does have a removable battery.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:51.920]   It has cut and paste.
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.080]   It has MMS.
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:55.320]   It doesn't have voice dialing.
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:56.840]   I mean, I think that there's going
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:59.360]   to be a lot of people who are sprint customers for first
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:01.840]   or foremost, because you have to go sprint.
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.840]   But also, a lot of people who didn't get the iPhone
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:05.640]   who might be looking more closely at the Palm.
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:06.920]   Well, I think one of the things that's growing
[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.200]   is one of the requirements is now going
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.320]   to be also a really good developer market.
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.000]   Because I know that--
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   Well, and this is easy to develop for.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   Really easy.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.320]   Now, ironically, they're doing the same thing
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:17.720]   Apple did when they first said, oh yeah,
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.080]   you can develop for the iPhone.
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:23.040]   It's just JavaScript CS as an HTML.
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.720]   It's that same kind of development.
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:25.760]   It's not real development.
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:26.200]   But we'll see.
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.520]   I mean, the applications they've got look pretty good.
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:30.680]   Because I know the thing that my wife is still on the fence
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:31.400]   on the iPhone.
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:31.880]   Right.
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:32.760]   I think she might be--
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:35.240]   What's pulling her towards the iPhone is the--
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:37.360]   As I show her all this little Apple does this thing.
[00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.840]   And then I have to stuff together.
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:40.920]   And this might be a case where Apple has such a head start
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:44.160]   that it's hard for somebody to come along.
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:47.000]   Nobody is trying to beat the iPod anymore.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.680]   It's just a done deal.
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:52.480]   Other people make MP3 players, but nobody has the--
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.000]   In fact, Steve Ballmer was talking about the Zoom.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.880]   It sure sounds like they're going to give up on the Zoom.
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.800]   And they said, no way we're doing a Zoom phone.
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:00.960]   Microsoft's giving signals.
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.360]   They're going to pull out of the Zoom.
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:03.280]   How often do you steal?
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:04.360]   How often do you steal?
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:05.200]   It's a done deal.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.280]   If Microsoft can't beat the iPod, nobody can.
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.320]   But the iPhone may still be seen as vulnerable.
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:14.160]   Andy, what's your reaction to the I, the a pre, the palm
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:14.880]   pre?
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.680]   Well, it's great to see--
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:19.200]   It's great to see that Palm is getting up off the canvas.
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.480]   Because they used to be one of the--
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.760]   They used to be the great definitive tech company.
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:25.680]   And they just were just laying down and ready for the ghost
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:28.120]   to take them back to Jerusalem, really.
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.000]   Because they just couldn't get anything going.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.640]   There were a lot like Apple was before Steve Jobs came back.
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:37.520]   So I'm glad to see that they're making a big splash again.
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:40.040]   I'm glad to see that they're developing a piece of technology
[00:21:40.040 --> 00:21:41.360]   that actually sounds very interesting.
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.720]   It sounds like they have a really interesting take
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:47.720]   on phones and internet operating systems.
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:50.840]   But Apple will never have a monopoly on phones,
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:53.120]   because a phone is such an idiosyncratic device.
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:55.520]   Everybody wants a different thing out of them.
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:57.480]   You start off with just the simple fact
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:59.840]   that there's a great percentage of the populace that
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:02.920]   can't use an iPhone because they need a tactile interface
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.240]   or they need a voice command interface.
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:07.200]   I mean, people who can't see very well,
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:10.200]   I mean, it's great that the iPhone is doing so well.
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.680]   It's great that there's so much software.
[00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:13.240]   But it is absolutely useless to people
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.360]   who have different needs like that.
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:19.080]   And even outside of those really obvious things,
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:21.360]   the reason why the BlackBerry still does so very, very well
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:24.560]   is because they have kick ass email.
[00:22:24.560 --> 00:22:26.760]   When it comes time to buy 300 of these
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:30.240]   and deploy them to 300 idiots who work for your company,
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:33.640]   the BlackBerry's administration tools kick ass
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:35.320]   over the iPhones.
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:38.000]   There will never be anyone company that dominates
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.040]   the smartphone market the way that the iPod
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.160]   dominates the music player market.
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.240]   So there's a chance for Paul.
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.280]   Big chance for Paul.
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.000]   Paul, I haven't seen it yet.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.720]   Obviously, I haven't even tried it out yet.
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:50.240]   I'm looking forward to getting some playtime in,
[00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:55.240]   because again, sometimes the company that's best in,
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:57.840]   has the best opportunity to change the world
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.160]   is a company that has very little left to lose.
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:02.080]   That was true of Apple in the 90s,
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:04.240]   and that is certainly true of Palm today.
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:07.000]   - Well, I also think that it's such a big market
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.560]   that no one needs to dominate the market to do well.
[00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.400]   10% of the market or 5% of the market
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:15.920]   is enough to keep a company like Palm going
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:17.400]   for a very, very long time.
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:18.240]   You know what I mean?
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.280]   - I also have to point out that they have Sprint,
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.920]   which is a lot better high speed internet than,
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:26.640]   I mean, I would say arguably maybe number two to Verizon,
[00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:27.800]   but they're certainly in the pack.
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:30.120]   They have very fast high speed internet
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:31.360]   that's a very well distributed.
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.480]   I mean, their customer service is probably
[00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:34.480]   the worst of the pack.
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.200]   - I mean, that's the unfortunate thing about the iPhone,
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.200]   of course, is that the AT&T service
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:41.160]   is probably the worst of the customer service.
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:42.960]   - No, no, the customer service actually
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.040]   has gotten much better.
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:46.160]   I think Apple's trained them, but it's better.
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.160]   - The speed and the availability.
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:50.440]   - Even their 3G speed is not about the--
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:51.680]   - Some of it is the United States.
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:54.120]   I mean, I was using my iPhone in Japan,
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:55.760]   and it would be fun.
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:56.840]   It's quite snappy.
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:59.440]   HSDPA isn't inherently bad, it's just the implementation.
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:00.760]   - Right.
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:03.440]   Well, we're all looking with great interest.
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:04.440]   We don't know when it's gonna come out.
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:05.520]   We don't know how much it's gonna be.
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:07.080]   We only know it's gonna be Sprint.
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:09.760]   - Well, and I love having some good close competitors.
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:13.520]   If we can see someone actually push Apple
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:16.360]   in certain directions, I think that that's very good
[00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:17.600]   for people who own iPhones.
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:20.840]   - Thank you Amazon for pushing Apple into non DRM.
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:22.680]   This is, that's a perfect example.
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:23.520]   - Right.
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:26.800]   - Without the competition, Apple can sometimes--
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:28.040]   - Sit on its butt.
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:30.960]   - As all of us probably do.
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:34.360]   Coming up, we're gonna talk about a presidential candidate
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:35.920]   who is a switcher.
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:38.440]   Former PC user announces he's going Mac.
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:39.280]   Who do you think it is?
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:40.320]   We'll talk about it in just a second,
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:43.080]   but first I wanna tell you about our good friends
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.080]   at audible.com.
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:48.920]   You know, I was a little late getting the show started today.
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.680]   'Cause I'm walking to work listening to Neil Gaiman's
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.480]   and Nancy Boys, and I'm like three minutes
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:54.840]   from the end of the night.
[00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:57.760]   I just, I hung out outside.
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:59.080]   It's such a good book.
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:01.880]   This is what Audible, you know that feeling, don't you, Andy?
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:03.160]   It's just what Audible does to you.
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:04.160]   You can't help it.
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:05.000]   - Yeah.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.280]   - Especially, like, see, realize that you live
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:09.440]   in really beautiful weather.
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:12.080]   Imagine me like in 10 degrees in my car,
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:13.440]   on the, in the driveway.
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.400]   I can go inside be more, a lot more comfortable
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:18.040]   than a lot warmer, but I just wanna see what happens
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:20.160]   to this little upstart known as John Adams.
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:22.280]   - Yeah, oh, that's a great book, by the way.
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:23.320]   Oh.
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:24.760]   That is such a, you know,
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:25.840]   that was such a good book.
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:27.920]   This sometimes happens to me with Audible.
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.440]   I don't think this is a negative in the least,
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:31.520]   but if a book's really good as that was,
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:34.640]   I went out and bought the hardcover as well, just to have it.
[00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:36.840]   - As a matter of, in that even works in reverse,
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.240]   I read the hardcover and liked it so much
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:40.920]   that I wanted to hear the Audible story, so.
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:43.680]   - Well, and the abridged one is read by,
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:45.640]   what's his name?
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:46.480]   - David McCullough.
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:47.320]   - David McCullough.
[00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:48.600]   And he just, you know, he's a narrator.
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:50.120]   He does, anyway, he does, you know,
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:53.280]   he's a very famous narrator, and he does such a good job with it.
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:55.000]   It's almost worth getting the abridged version,
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:55.920]   which is always available.
[00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:57.400]   It's now they haven't on abridged now,
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.360]   but the abridged version and then getting the book,
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:01.680]   and you get the best of both worlds, so wonderful.
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:03.960]   - See, I, when I see the movie,
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:05.440]   sometimes I want to listen to the book.
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.280]   - There's an example.
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:09.760]   If you saw the HBO John Adams, in fact,
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:12.320]   on the Golden Globes Awards, that's what Paul Giamatti said.
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:13.720]   He said, "Read the book."
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.000]   It's brilliant.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.920]   It is a book that will turn you on to American history,
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:21.320]   and what's interesting, completely revitalizes Adams
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:22.880]   in history because for a long time,
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:24.520]   he wasn't really very well regarded.
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:25.360]   - Or just a book note.
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:27.920]   - I mean, it wasn't until he was badly regarded,
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:29.520]   just not very regarded at all.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:30.360]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:33.320]   He was just not, yeah, and boy, what a fascinating film.
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:34.240]   - Andy, is that your picker?
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:35.240]   Do you have something that I have for us?
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:37.640]   - No, no, no, I think I must have picked that a long time ago.
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:39.440]   - Oh, yeah, we've picked it many times, yeah.
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.320]   - It's one that we figure out, out of the books.
[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:43.760]   This is now, during Mac World Expo,
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:48.760]   I had the monthly gold membership, audible credits rollover,
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:50.720]   and of course I found myself with a brand new book
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:52.240]   that I could download.
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:55.680]   And about a month ago, I came across one of those authors
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.800]   where you just, you get three chapters
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:59.560]   into your first book by this person, and you think,
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:01.640]   "Oh God, I'm such an idiot for not reading this,
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:05.840]   "not having known about this guy earlier."
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:08.080]   Really great speculative fiction author
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:09.600]   by the name of Jonathan Carroll.
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:12.120]   - I don't even know him.
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:16.000]   - He writes these, it's a unique voice.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.400]   You wanna compare them to Douglas Adams.
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:20.840]   You want to compare him to Kurt Vonnegut
[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:22.480]   in the way that he will,
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:25.520]   you wanna compare him a little bit to Neil Gaiman,
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:28.520]   in the way that he can do these fantasy novels
[00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:31.040]   and these really wildly imaginative novels
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:34.320]   that are nonetheless set largely within the sort of world
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:36.040]   that we know about.
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:39.280]   It's funny, it's sharp, it's really compelling.
[00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:41.200]   I've started getting into him, like I said,
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:45.760]   about a month ago, reading, which I'm sorry,
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:49.360]   I've actually read two of his books since last month.
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:50.920]   So it's hard to remember which ones.
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:53.040]   I think I started out with White Apples,
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:57.000]   and then I bought Glass Soup.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.080]   The one that I'm recommending for Audible
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:03.040]   is a book called The Ghost in Love, which I have not read yet.
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:05.240]   I'm trying to decide whether I wanna read the book first
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:06.560]   or listen to the Audible first,
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:08.680]   but I did actually use my credits to buy it.
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:12.480]   The basic synopsis, and this is all I know about it so far,
[00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:17.280]   is that a guy falls on the street,
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:20.600]   hits his head on a sidewalk curb, and should die.
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:21.440]   He really should.
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.000]   Ghost comes to pick him up and say,
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.720]   okay, time to go the afterlife, but he doesn't actually die.
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:29.280]   And this really confuses a lot of people on the other side
[00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:31.520]   because the rule has always been humans die
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:33.440]   and their ghosts go elsewhere.
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:35.640]   And so essentially, the entire book,
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:38.120]   I've only, it was such a great synopsis
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:40.360]   that I sort of stopped reading after the second paragraph
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:42.440]   because now I wanna go as absolutely clean
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:43.680]   as I can into this book.
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:47.440]   The basic premise is that, well, this rule seems to be broken
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:50.480]   and how does that affect the balance of power?
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.360]   How does that affect the hedge money
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:54.440]   that we've been doing for the past three, 4,000 years?
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:56.760]   It's exactly the sort of book that just,
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:00.280]   you wanna read the little blurb on the back and say,
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:01.600]   I'm not even gonna bother opening this.
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:03.800]   This is going right to the checkout stand right now.
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:07.240]   So having read two of his other books,
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:10.120]   I've given him the Andy Anatko Platinum,
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:12.920]   Double Diamond Gold Card of credit, meaning that he,
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:17.120]   he can, my afternoon, my two or three days of reading
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:19.480]   is are in his hands because I can start off in Carol.
[00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:21.200]   - Oh, it does sound like something I'd love
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:23.320]   'cause I do love Neil Gaiman, I love that kind of stuff.
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:25.080]   I love ghost books.
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:27.480]   Now you see here, I'm looking at my audible account
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:30.600]   and my credits are zero because of course,
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:32.880]   I have a platinum, so I get two books a month,
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:36.360]   but it doesn't take me long when that rollover date comes
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.040]   to pick books, so here's what I'm gonna do
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:39.280]   and this is a nice feature of Audible.
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:41.200]   I'm gonna add this to my wish list,
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.120]   you see that button right there?
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:45.800]   I click that wish list and I've added it to my wish list
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.120]   and you can see what other titles,
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:49.760]   so that you keep track of 'cause what happens with Audible?
[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:51.640]   - This is how you end up using a boy or a credits
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:52.560]   in the first day, right?
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:54.400]   - Oh yeah, what happens with Audible is that you hear
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:57.240]   people like Andy say, oh, you gotta listen to this and this.
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:59.960]   So you see, I have actually a fairly long wish list
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:01.200]   of books and now it's on the bottom
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.080]   and I'm gonna move it up.
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:04.200]   This is just like your kind of your Netflix queue.
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:05.800]   The only difference is it's not automatic,
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:07.400]   you have to choose the book,
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:09.880]   but I'm gonna tell you what, you can choose this book
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:14.720]   or any of the other 51,000 titles on Audible.com
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:17.680]   by just going to Audible.com/Macbreak,
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:19.120]   sign up for the gold account,
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:20.960]   that'll give you one book a month, a good way to start
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:24.120]   and it gives you a credit towards that first book,
[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:26.880]   which sounds like should be "The Ghost in Love".
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:29.520]   I can't wait to listen to this, Jonathan Carroll.
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:31.240]   Thank you Andy once again for introducing us
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:34.320]   to somebody new and exciting.
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:39.320]   Audible.com/Macbreak, I'm telling you,
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:41.960]   if you don't listen to Audible books yet,
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:44.440]   you're missing out on one of the great pleasures in life.
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:47.280]   Audible.com/Macbreak, we thank you so much
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:49.760]   for their support of Macbreak Weekly.
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:52.360]   All right, so which, do you got any guesses
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:54.560]   as to which presidential candidate
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:59.000]   is switching to a Mac, former presidential candidate?
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   Bob Dole.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.920]   That'd be a good guess.
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:05.600]   I think our viewers had figured it out.
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:08.160]   They already said in the chatroom, Mike Huckabee.
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:11.320]   I think it's gonna be big for Mac sales actually.
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:13.840]   I don't know, the Reverend Huckabee
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:17.040]   is switching to a Macintosh,
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:19.680]   according to the unofficial,
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:23.000]   I always have to get this right, it's unofficial, right?
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.760]   Not Apple Weblog.
[00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:26.280]   Yeah, T-U-A-W.
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:30.520]   M-B-W-I-D is.com, I'm gonna go there.
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:33.880]   We have links to all of our stories on there,
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:36.040]   and this is a story from T-U-A-W.
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:39.040]   They may be, let me see if they're linking to somebody else.
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:43.000]   Huckabee dumps PC for Mac, former presidential candidate,
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.240]   and Arkansas ex-governor Mike Huckabee is traded in his PC
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.920]   for Mac book, he talked about it on his Sunday Fox News Channel
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:53.080]   show, he praises the staff at the New York Apple Store.
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:54.240]   See, I think he's fine.
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:56.480]   (laughing)
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:57.640]   What are you doing?
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:00.080]   You can't be like a former presidential candidate
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:02.400]   and not just have everything you say filtered that way.
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:03.720]   Exactly.
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:05.320]   At a big red podium, say,
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:07.960]   "First of all, I'd like to thank the staff and personnel
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:10.000]   "at the Apple Store at the network,
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.960]   "the hard-working people represented
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:13.640]   "by the retail establishment,
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:16.360]   "so underserved by our current."
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:19.680]   Well, and the other thing is he,
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:21.880]   I think Rush Limbaugh is a Big Mac fan,
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:25.240]   so it's possible that we're going to see a swing to the right.
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:26.880]   (applause)
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:31.240]   Mike Huckabee from his TV show on Fox News.
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:35.200]   Fox, don't sue me, this is just a news story, right?
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.440]   So it's okay.
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:37.440]   (applause)
[00:32:37.440 --> 00:32:38.800]   Well, this week...
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.960]   Oh, it's also stalling out.
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:44.840]   Has YouTube been doing that a lot lately?
[00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:46.680]   Maybe a lot of people are watching this, Mike Huckabee.
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:48.480]   Everyone's excited about Mike Huckabee.
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:51.080]   They've come to realize that some companies are...
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:53.360]   I probably would've given him the edge in a couple of states
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:54.920]   if he knew that he was a Mac user
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:56.960]   and had a big Mac logo up there.
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:58.680]   No, Obama hasn't been inaugurated yet.
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:00.600]   How come you might still be in there with a chance?
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:01.840]   You might have a chance.
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:02.960]   There's only a week left.
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.320]   Apparently, the Obama team favors Max as well,
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:07.800]   and there may be some way for him to keep his blackberry, too.
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:09.320]   We'll keep you posted on that breaking news.
[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:12.160]   Trouble, because they forgot a simple principle
[00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:13.920]   that made many enterprise...
[00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:15.800]   Oh, I want to play this cut.
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:17.360]   All right, we'll get back to that.
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:21.080]   We'll let YouTube do its little buffer thing.
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:22.040]   Boy, that's kind of strange.
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:23.520]   I'm not even, oh, I'm watching in high quality.
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:25.880]   Maybe I should watch in low quality.
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:27.080]   That's a successful...
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:30.320]   And that is that the customer is always right.
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:32.960]   Now, I've been dealing with customer service people
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:37.240]   who apparently thought the customer was always wrong.
[00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:39.160]   I pray you don't have to deal with the wireless service.
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.920]   He really is a preacher, isn't he?
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:42.080]   He has not changed.
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:42.920]   He's got that.
[00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.920]   You could see him in the pulpit.
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:47.320]   If so, be prepared for hours on the phone
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:48.600]   and in person at the office
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:52.360]   trying to get them to make a previously working device work again
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:54.800]   because you upgraded your service
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:58.280]   and it caused them instead to cut off your service.
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.400]   And to that experience, the frustration,
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:01.880]   to the point of insanity,
[00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:05.080]   dealing with an airline who cancels your flight
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:06.760]   and then wants to charge you extra money
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:08.840]   for having inconvenienced you.
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:09.680]   Now, I'm not kidding.
[00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:12.120]   I spent a frustrating evening trying to figure
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:13.840]   somehow how to get on a plane and...
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:15.280]   All right, I think it's the Apple stuff.
[00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:17.720]   They probably won't be that big.
[00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:18.840]   Probably gonna have to...
[00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:20.200]   (mumbles)
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:21.360]   It's not all bad.
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:23.720]   Just last week I switched after 22 years
[00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:26.400]   from a PC to an Apple MacBook
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:28.640]   with serious fear and trepidation on this.
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:29.480]   Oh, the audience likes it.
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:31.080]   I would cook it in traumatic.
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:34.560]   But thanks to an amazing group of young, bright, patient
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:37.320]   and personable staff at the Apple Store in New York,
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:39.160]   it's actually been a breeze.
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:42.000]   So he's liking his customer experience.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.400]   That's the kind of thing that's the kind of plug
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:45.960]   you really want, isn't it?
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:47.080]   Well, I think that's one of the things
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:50.320]   that the Apple Store in general is good for,
[00:34:50.320 --> 00:34:52.640]   especially for PC users doing the switch,
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:53.760]   is going into the Apple Store
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.840]   and letting them actually help you get that stuff moved
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:56.680]   from one place to another.
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:34:57.520]   Rather than trying to do it.
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:58.640]   I think a lot of people that you talk to
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:00.400]   that have a really bad experience with it,
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:01.760]   just try to, they just buy one.
[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:04.720]   And it is a different language in some ways.
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:10.360]   Our friend Alcor has a new, I think it's from Alcor.
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:11.840]   Google has a new Apple search.
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:12.680]   Have you seen this?
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:15.000]   The Google Quick Search for Apple?
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.360]   It's just basically spotlight.
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:17.880]   It's a little disappointing.
[00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:19.560]   They're calling it quick silver like,
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:23.280]   Life Hacker says it's like quick silver from Google.
[00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:24.920]   And I suspect Alcor is working on this
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:26.120]   because he's at Google.
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:27.840]   And he's kind of stopped.
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:28.680]   Yeah, it is.
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:29.880]   It's Nicholas Jikkoff has developed it.
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:32.440]   So he's kind of stopped development of quick silver.
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:33.960]   Those who I've talked to say,
[00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:35.680]   it's not, it ain't no quick silver.
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:37.360]   But what it does is it searches
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:44.040]   your computer at the same time as it's searching the internet.
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:46.640]   So it has that kind of, you type in, you know,
[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:47.480]   control space.
[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:48.440]   So somehow crossing that line,
[00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:49.280]   I'm not so excited about it.
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:51.240]   Yeah, maybe not.
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:54.440]   I don't like my internal computer being the expert.
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:55.280]   Yeah, I don't.
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:58.480]   I got, I got a freaked out family member who came to me
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:00.800]   and said, I did a search on Google
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:05.000]   and it found all of these emails that I had sent out.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:07.160]   Are they online?
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:09.680]   And he was all freaked out.
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:11.760]   And he actually had called his work and said,
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:12.640]   "Look, I'm really sorry.
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:14.480]   I don't know how this got out."
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:16.400]   And I said, "No, no, that's the Google desktop search.
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.400]   It's finding stuff on the internet."
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.320]   And stuff on your computer.
[00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:21.960]   And that really confuses people.
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:22.800]   Right.
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:23.640]   Scares them.
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:25.480]   We won't.
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:26.320]   I'll mention it.
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:27.680]   It's not our pick of the week or anything like that,
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:30.000]   but it's in the Google Labs.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.480]   It's one of their new Google features.
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:35.960]   And it's apparently quite like the Google iPhone app.
[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:36.800]   Right.
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:38.560]   And you can't talk to it though.
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:40.560]   How would that make you feel if Quicksilver
[00:36:40.560 --> 00:36:42.120]   became a Google product?
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:43.800]   Not happy.
[00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:44.640]   Not happy.
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:47.400]   It looks like Quicksilver's kind of gone on a prosource, right?
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:48.600]   They've got other people working on it.
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:49.440]   Yeah.
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:50.280]   It's such a...
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:51.320]   I know neither of you guys use it.
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:52.160]   Are you to use it?
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:53.000]   I don't use it.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   Neither of you guys use it.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.360]   Nobody else on the show uses it.
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:56.640]   I generally like...
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:58.440]   We have so many computers at the office
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:37:01.120]   and we try to keep them configured kind of in the same way
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:02.120]   and what we don't.
[00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:04.280]   So I tend not to want to have special things
[00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:05.800]   where I'm hitting keys and expecting something
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:07.080]   and having to not pop up.
[00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:08.640]   Right.
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:09.640]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:12.400]   Because of your special needs, your special needs.
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:13.240]   Otherwise, I think I'd use it.
[00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:14.440]   I love the efficiency of it.
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:17.880]   I just... There's some more stringent requirements
[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:19.440]   for what we're doing.
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:23.800]   Hackintosh now can be installed directly
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:28.800]   from the Leopard OS disk according to manube.com.
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:32.760]   You can take...
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:35.200]   You have to do a little bit of preparation.
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:37.280]   You need a PC with Intel Core processors
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:39.480]   and an Intel chipset.
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:41.960]   You have to put boot 132 on a blank CD,
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:45.280]   but you can use the retail OS X installer,
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.520]   the Leopard installer.
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:51.480]   And once you install it according to this article,
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:52.720]   you can do Apple updates.
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:57.000]   You now have what is essentially a Macintosh on a PC
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.600]   until Snow Leopard comes out.
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:02.760]   Well, Leopard is Leopard as long as you saw them.
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:03.640]   So you got it working.
[00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:06.200]   Yeah, and you can update it and everything.
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:07.560]   I think that's very interesting.
[00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:09.760]   This is a huge leap forward.
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:11.680]   A lot of people now are buying PCs.
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:14.320]   A lot of the more sophisticated users are buying PCs
[00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:16.320]   and putting Mac software on it.
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:17.480]   Well, the cool thing is,
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:20.920]   last week at the speakers,
[00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:22.200]   I saw a couple of different people
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:27.200]   who didn't just have these big expensive Intel Core Duo,
[00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:29.920]   MacBook, Grade, Windows machines.
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:32.840]   They had like $300, $350 netbooks.
[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:33.680]   Running.
[00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:34.520]   Yeah.
[00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:36.080]   They were running the OS.
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:39.120]   And it wasn't slow, it wasn't choppy.
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:40.360]   It looked like a low...
[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:43.560]   It was essentially a $400 MacBook Air, only smaller.
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:44.480]   Yeah.
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:47.800]   And the installer was...
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:52.080]   If you go out with the intention of building yourself
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.640]   a $400 MacBook Air like this,
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:57.000]   it can be very, very tricky to get these installers working
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.560]   with multiple steps and shagging down
[00:38:58.560 --> 00:38:59.520]   different kinds of drivers.
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:01.280]   But there are specific models
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:03.480]   that where the instructions are so well-honed
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:05.160]   that it is barely more...
[00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:07.760]   It's actually, it's somewhere between these
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:10.760]   installing Mac OS X and installing Windows.
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:12.280]   Meaning that it's something that a consumer
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:13.120]   couldn't definitely do.
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:14.640]   You just go to this website, realize that,
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:16.600]   okay, these three models of netbooks
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:19.720]   that cost $350 are very, very easily adapted
[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:20.560]   using this software.
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:24.800]   So I'll go out and buy this model of Asus or Acer PC.
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:26.560]   Do you know which models?
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:27.560]   I don't have a listen to front of me.
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:29.120]   I'm looking from Googling for it right now.
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:31.320]   I saw the guy, the guy, it was a Derek story.
[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:34.800]   Somebody at the speaker room had an Asus EPC running.
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.000]   Running, running, oh, it's 10.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.080]   Running, oh, it's 10.
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:38.360]   And it was, you're right, Andy.
[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:40.520]   It was a thing of beauty.
[00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:43.240]   Yeah, I mean, it looked like a...
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:46.240]   I have screen savers on a lot of my PCs
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:48.720]   that are just, you know, screen grabs from Macs,
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:49.720]   just to freak people out.
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:52.200]   Those before it became this easy to adapt
[00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:54.560]   Windows machines to run the OS.
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:56.760]   I tried it, I mean, the only thing I didn't like about it
[00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:59.000]   was the tiny keyboard that you would have gotten anyway
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.160]   with a tiny PC.
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:03.280]   So I haven't actually, I'm still digging out
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:06.600]   from the usual after effects of closing my office for a week.
[00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:11.120]   But I actually have a net book sitting around the office
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:12.480]   that has them doing much of anything.
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:14.040]   And sometime this week or next week,
[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:16.480]   I'm actually gonna set it up for use as a Mac.
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:17.560]   What do you know what you do?
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:20.040]   Do you have to, you probably have to make a disk image
[00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:20.960]   or something?
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:22.640]   Yeah, it's pretty simple.
[00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:24.440]   You can download, unfortunately,
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:26.000]   I don't have my nose in front of me,
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.200]   but it is a very simple installer.
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:31.120]   You do have to prepare the installer,
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:34.480]   the OS installer to run properly.
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:37.760]   The third problem is that some of your device drivers
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:39.720]   are not gonna work properly because, of course,
[00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:42.240]   they're not designed to work with Alien Hardware.
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:45.400]   But if you choose the net book correctly,
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:48.840]   there are other companies that have found some website
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:51.480]   somewhere on the net book maker's website,
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:53.560]   where you can download the right Bitcom driver
[00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:55.640]   or the right driver for the webcam
[00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:57.320]   and the right driver for the wireless
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:58.680]   that will actually make it work.
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:01.480]   Then stops becoming a problem of guesswork
[00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:03.960]   and starts becoming a simple problem of just go here,
[00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:06.120]   download this link, follow these directions.
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:08.240]   I mean, I've done enough Linux installs
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:11.560]   to know that this is not unexpected.
[00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:12.800]   We're trying to figure out how come
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:14.800]   this is a standard HP notebook,
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:16.000]   cannot access the Wi-Fi,
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.280]   well, it's because there is not an open source driver
[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:20.240]   for the Wi-Fi, you have to go elsewhere to find it.
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:22.920]   It's a big problem if you try to just grab any notebook
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:25.720]   and try to make it work, but it's trivially easy almost.
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:27.880]   If you buy a net book with the intention
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:30.320]   of installing Mac OS on it and you buy the right one.
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:33.600]   - Boim Boim gadgets has a table
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:37.520]   and essentially it's the Dell Mini 9 or the MSI Wind.
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:39.280]   Those are the two that you kind of want to get.
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:42.040]   They give you everything, Wi-Fi, USB, ethernet works,
[00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:44.000]   audio works, Bluetooth even works.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.120]   I think we need to do one of these.
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:46.960]   - Yeah.
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:47.800]   (laughs)
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:48.640]   - Yeah.
[00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:49.560]   - How much are they?
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:51.800]   - They're under $500.
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:55.680]   Both the Wind and the Mini 9 run an Atom processor
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.240]   so probably only have a gigabyte of memory.
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:41:59.040]   So, you know, how well does it--
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:01.040]   - You're not gonna be cutting on Final Cut Pro any soon.
[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:03.160]   - No, but I mean for email and surfing,
[00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:04.000]   I'm getting one.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.160]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:06.960]   If you want a net book type experience,
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:08.080]   that's more than enough.
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:10.240]   And again, I've used a couple of different attempts
[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:13.720]   at doing these and I did not notice that I was using,
[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:16.440]   outside of the ugly box, I did not notice
[00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:19.040]   that I was using anything other than an Apple product.
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:21.200]   - Wow, that is kind of stunning.
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:25.240]   And it also makes you wonder if Apple missed a bet
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:26.600]   by not putting out one of these.
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:29.800]   I mean, I wonder how many people will do this.
[00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:32.160]   If it's a thousand, Apple doesn't care.
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:33.560]   If it's a hundred thousand.
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:36.960]   - It's an interesting idea.
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:40.160]   The reason why Apple came out with the iPod Shuffle
[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:42.480]   was because there was money on the table
[00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:44.240]   that other people were taking off the table.
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:47.600]   And that's the idea of a really ultra cheap music player.
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:49.160]   That was the one vulnerability.
[00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:51.680]   And they never insisted that the Shuffle was
[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:52.840]   a really great iPod.
[00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:55.600]   They just insisted that it was a really cheap iPod.
[00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:58.080]   I wonder if Apple would ever just make that sort of decision
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:01.320]   saying that we're gonna be very, very upfront about this.
[00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:04.320]   We just want more people to be able to afford Macs.
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:06.720]   So we basically, the only design feature
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:08.120]   that was important in this model was
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:10.140]   we wanna sell it for $399.
[00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:11.640]   I'm not a penny more.
[00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:14.240]   - We've brought the, I'm going to the MSI Wind website
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:17.000]   and it's down, we brought the MSI Wind website down.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.640]   So there's at least a few people
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:23.800]   who are immediately saying, wow, that's a good idea.
[00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:25.440]   I'd like to try that.
[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:27.040]   - Yeah, MSI that almost seems like a reason
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:29.040]   for you to like mail us three of them.
[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:29.960]   - So that we can say.
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:31.400]   - Yeah, we need to do a comparison.
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:33.440]   We need one from Dell, one from Wind.
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:35.000]   - One from Dell.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.520]   - I mean, how did Boylan do this?
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:37.840]   They probably had some.
[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:39.320]   - Lots of neat snacks.
[00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:41.960]   Look at this, this site, it's sitting on the site.
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:43.800]   I can't get it to come up.
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:45.200]   That's not good.
[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:48.960]   All right, we're gonna get to our picks in just a bit.
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:51.520]   Andy, Alex and I have some great picks for you,
[00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:53.520]   but I gotta give you a pick right now.
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:57.920]   Then an easy pick when we all love, it's Drobo.
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:00.080]   This show brought to you by the good folks at Drobo.
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:03.440]   DROBO.com.
[00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:06.560]   Right now, get $50 off a brand new Drobo
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:08.280]   at Drobo.com/Macbreak.
[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:11.120]   Good through the end of the month, January 31st.
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:14.400]   $50 off instantly, you don't even have to send in a coupon.
[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:18.720]   The new Drobo with Firewire 800 and USB 2.0 is fast.
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:20.960]   I mean really fast.
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:23.280]   Four hard drives combined to give you speed
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:26.080]   and redundancy, you'll never lose a bit of data.
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:28.200]   And if you wanna get bigger, you just pop out one drive
[00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:30.040]   and put in a bigger drive.
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:31.640]   The drive rebuilds, you never lose a bite,
[00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:33.840]   you never offline, you can even do it
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:35.000]   while the Drobo's on.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.560]   Drobo's fantastic.
[00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:41.240]   The award-winning large, redundant hard drive
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:44.320]   that protects you from a hard drive crash,
[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:45.960]   you can get as big as, once the drives come out,
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:48.000]   they'll be as big as 16 terabytes.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.760]   I think the biggest now is six,
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:52.120]   'cause you can get four, one and a half terabyte drives.
[00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:53.280]   But that's anything about the Drobo.
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:55.680]   You can combine drives of different sizes.
[00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:58.840]   And unlike RAID, Drobo lets you combine the drives
[00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:01.160]   and adds up all the drives.
[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:03.000]   RAID will just take the size of the smallest drive
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.360]   and make them all the same.
[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:05.720]   That's no good.
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:06.840]   That doesn't work.
[00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:07.920]   Try it right now.
[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:10.960]   Twice as fast as the first generation Drobo quieter
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:15.280]   and cooler, expandable, safe, redundant, easy to use,
[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:18.800]   Firewire and USB visit Drobo.com/Macbreak
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:23.240]   to learn more about Drobo and get $50 off your very own.
[00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:24.840]   Offer good through the end of the month,
[00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:27.360]   January 31st, 2009.
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:29.160]   Drobo, you.
[00:45:29.160 --> 00:45:31.160]   All right, let's get our picks of the week
[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:32.400]   and then we'll wrap this thing up.
[00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:35.000]   I think my new pick is an MSI win-running OS X.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:37.240]   - I can't do it first. - Oh yeah, okay.
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:38.720]   Oh.
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:39.760]   Oh, all right.
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:43.080]   We got a bunch of fun stuff in the speakers bag.
[00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:44.360]   Oh man, you guys.
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:46.920]   Macworld is the best speaker bag.
[00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:51.920]   I did, I asked, I went through it before Twit this Sunday
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:54.960]   on camera and I asked people to follow along and add it up
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:57.800]   and they added up, it was $1,800 worth of software
[00:45:57.800 --> 00:45:58.640]   and hardware.
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:00.200]   You know, those headphones were not cheap.
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:02.480]   Yeah, they gave us the top of the line though.
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:03.920]   They were not the top of the line shores,
[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:04.760]   but they were very good ones.
[00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:07.520]   $350 or $300 headphones, the little shores.
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:09.200]   I think Lisa took mine.
[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:10.040]   She wanted mine.
[00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:11.080]   I didn't swear to God.
[00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:12.920]   Where'd they go?
[00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:14.560]   You know, I know she was, she was iron mine.
[00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:15.720]   I gave her my ex-stand.
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:17.520]   I was having lunch with Lisa and Justine
[00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:19.680]   and we were going through this, or Lisa and Kirsten.
[00:46:19.680 --> 00:46:20.600]   And we were going through it and Kirsten
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:22.960]   ended up with something, but I don't remember what it was.
[00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:24.480]   - I'm gonna start with, this is something actually
[00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:28.640]   that Daniel Bruszilowski brought by.
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:30.800]   And you've heard about the Mophie cases.
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:35.000]   They're extra battery cases that fit slip onto an iPhone.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.480]   I really haven't had a need for one
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:39.920]   because of the new iPhone battery life
[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:41.680]   has been so spectacular.
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:43.360]   - I use my Mophie three times a week.
[00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:44.200]   - You do.
[00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:45.040]   We might wanna look at this.
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:48.360]   This is from Fast Mac, it's called True Power 4.
[00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:50.040]   It is an iPhone, it's just like the Mophie,
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:52.800]   you slip the iPhone into it.
[00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:55.000]   - This just came out, I think.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.440]   - Yeah, just came out. - Just seeing that one.
[00:46:56.440 --> 00:46:58.920]   - So here's the deal, it has a couple of extra features.
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:00.800]   First of all, it's got a flashlight.
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:02.920]   I mean, yeah, I guess that's a flashlight.
[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:05.000]   - Or for when you're shooting video, you can have a light.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.600]   - Or you could use it, oh.
[00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:12.480]   I'm a little slow, 'cause it's right next to the camera.
[00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:14.560]   - Oh my goodness.
[00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:15.880]   - I just thought it was a flashlight.
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:17.080]   - Oh no, no, no, no.
[00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:22.120]   On all those low light issues that you might have with it.
[00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:23.160]   - Well, and see, look at that.
[00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:25.400]   - Yeah, something happened to me that really,
[00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:30.400]   I've been using the pre-release of quick for the iPhone.
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:32.120]   - Oh, and it just burned that battery.
[00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:33.560]   - Burn that battery right down.
[00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:35.280]   And so that's when I, so normally I don't,
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:37.120]   with normal use, I really don't need this.
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:39.080]   But boy, when you're doing something like shooting video.
[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:41.200]   - Yes, if you're driving a lot in somewhere,
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:42.520]   you don't know, you burn right through it.
[00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:45.120]   So that's what I do, I keep this in the car on the charger.
[00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:48.400]   And then if I run out because I've been using something,
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:51.360]   I can always get, and it's quite a bit of extra life.
[00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:53.880]   I mean, you can charge up, it has a connector,
[00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:57.520]   so you can charge it and the iPhone at the same time,
[00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:58.520]   or sync.
[00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:00.680]   So if you wanted to keep the iPhone in it all the time,
[00:48:00.680 --> 00:48:01.680]   you could.
[00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:03.560]   It also has an on/off switch,
[00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:04.800]   which I think is a really good idea.
[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:05.800]   Does Mofy do that?
[00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:07.360]   - Oh yeah, it leaves some.
[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:09.080]   - Well, no, I don't think it has an on/off.
[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:10.880]   So you see, do you hear that charging sound?
[00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:12.680]   Because when I turn it off, it's not charging the iPhone.
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:14.000]   - 'Cause what it's doing is the iPhone
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.120]   just thinks it's being plugged in.
[00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:15.960]   - Right.
[00:48:15.960 --> 00:48:16.800]   - When you pop this in. - Exactly.
[00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:18.760]   So I can keep it off, keep it in the iPhone.
[00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:21.880]   When the iPhone chart uses itself up, and I turn it on,
[00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:24.400]   and the iPhone thinks it's being charged.
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:27.040]   It also has a button to see how much charge you've got
[00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:29.160]   with the four lights, and I think that's very handy.
[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:30.640]   So this is a very nice.
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:32.360]   - I think it has a, I think the features are great.
[00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:34.080]   It's a little bit more bulky than the--
[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:35.080]   - It is more bulky, yeah.
[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:36.400]   - And so I think what I like about the Mofy
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:39.200]   is that it's just a little bit bigger than my iPhone.
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:40.040]   - Right.
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:42.760]   - I think that the features on this one are fantastic.
[00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:44.400]   - Nice case. - Yeah.
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:48.280]   - You can also, it's got a two and one charger,
[00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:50.280]   so it's got a USB port on the bottom.
[00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:52.240]   So if you want to, if you have something like a Bluetooth
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:54.720]   headset that charges via the USB port,
[00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:57.320]   you can have it all be charging at once off of it.
[00:48:57.320 --> 00:49:01.120]   It says you get up to 24 hours of talktime,
[00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:04.760]   750 hours of standby time, 18 hours of internet use,
[00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:07.360]   21 hours, you know, I don't know if we believe these.
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:09.080]   But I was very impressed with this.
[00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:13.440]   This is the TruePower 4 from Fast Mac.
[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:18.200]   And I think it runs, let me get a price before I quote you.
[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:19.280]   - I think it's not that expensive.
[00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:21.480]   - Yeah, I don't think it's like $79.
[00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:22.560]   How much is the Mofy?
[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:23.400]   - A $99.
[00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:25.800]   - I wanted the Mofy for a long time.
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:28.360]   And it took them a while to come out with the Mofy
[00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:30.360]   for the iPhone 3.
[00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:31.200]   - I pre-ordered it.
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:32.720]   I had it the day it showed up.
[00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:33.760]   - You do use this.
[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:36.880]   - I use the Mofy all the, so I leave my Mofy plugged in
[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:38.120]   all the time.
[00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:39.800]   Anytime, you know, I always have it charged
[00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:41.080]   and it's always sitting in my bag
[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:42.440]   or almost always sitting in my bag.
[00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:44.240]   And I, you know, it's just that backup,
[00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:46.200]   especially when I'm busy or I'm on a set
[00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:48.760]   or I just forgot to plug it in the night before.
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:52.040]   - Anyway, I'm really, I left the light on.
[00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:53.800]   - That's fine, for quick, you know, this,
[00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:54.800]   now that I know this is a--
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:55.640]   - For interviews.
[00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:56.600]   - For video, like-- - For quick interviews.
[00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:59.400]   - Well, I was at the, I was at the tweet up
[00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:01.120]   at the beginning of Mac world.
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:03.600]   And I had just been hacked, my Twitter account,
[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:04.520]   I'd just been hacked and it turned out.
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:07.240]   So was Barack Obama's, so was Kevin Rose's,
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:10.200]   a lot of the 33 of the top Twitterers, including Fox News
[00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:13.160]   and Rick Sanchez of CNN had been hacked.
[00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:14.840]   And who sits down across from me,
[00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:17.560]   but NetTick, who is the security,
[00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:19.640]   one of the security guys at Twitter.
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:22.320]   So I whip out my iPhone, I start the video,
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:23.160]   I say, "What happened?"
[00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:25.520]   And he gave me a whole interview, quick.
[00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:26.360]   - Right.
[00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:27.280]   - And actually it did fairly well given
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:28.640]   that it was in a bar in fairly low light.
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:30.040]   In fact, I put it on my website
[00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:31.120]   'cause I thought it was kind of a scoop
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:34.560]   to get the, you know, the actual story.
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:35.680]   But boy, I wish I'd had this
[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:37.080]   and the light would have made a huge difference.
[00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:37.920]   - Yeah.
[00:50:37.920 --> 00:50:39.800]   Now I carry it with me in my car,
[00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:42.040]   as I said, I keep it charged up just in case.
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:43.360]   And if I have to jump out
[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:46.080]   and cover a fire flood or earthquake,
[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:49.320]   I am ready, I report, I am there.
[00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:54.280]   Andy Inaco is here, what's your pick of the week, Mr. I?
[00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:56.720]   - Well, there's a device that I've been actually playing with
[00:50:56.720 --> 00:51:00.000]   on the Windows side for three or four months.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:03.000]   And it became, I've been playing with it on Windows
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.920]   because I knew that new Mac software for this
[00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:07.760]   would be coming out at Mac world Expo.
[00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:12.200]   And for the purposes of our video audience,
[00:51:12.200 --> 00:51:15.840]   I can actually show that this is the neat receipts,
[00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:18.360]   documents, portable document scanning system.
[00:51:18.360 --> 00:51:21.120]   - I use the big one.
[00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:22.400]   In fact, we use it in the office,
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:23.560]   and it is the best thing ever.
[00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:25.560]   I just give Frederik all my receipts
[00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:29.120]   and just goes, "Yeah." - For those software.
[00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:30.840]   - Yeah, I mean, for those of you not seeing it,
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:34.000]   essentially this is a ultra-ultra compact
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:38.120]   full with document scanner that's completely powered by USB.
[00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:41.520]   And it's matched with really, really, really wonderful
[00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:44.480]   desktop document and receipt organization software.
[00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:46.640]   So when you come home, I was using it all last week
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:47.800]   at Mac world Expo.
[00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:51.200]   Every night I would empty my pockets of receipts,
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:54.920]   business cards, product information, press releases.
[00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:57.080]   You just feed them into this thing, one page
[00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:59.240]   and one item at a time, just like that.
[00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:02.560]   Zip, zip, zip, zip, zip, zip, the software, OCR is everything.
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:05.440]   It knows what a receipt is and it gets all the numbers,
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:06.520]   all the-- - That's the amazing thing.
[00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:09.480]   - It knows what a business card is
[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:11.240]   and automatically adds stuff to your address book
[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:13.320]   or just holds it in an area so you can process it.
[00:52:13.320 --> 00:52:15.800]   Images, OCR's press releases.
[00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:19.120]   So essentially within about 15 or 20 minutes,
[00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:21.200]   I can essentially set fire to every piece of paper
[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:23.000]   that I acquired over the course of the day,
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.440]   knowing that it's safe on my MacBook.
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:27.840]   It can be backed up to the network.
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:31.760]   And four months later, when I'm doing my quarterlies
[00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:34.160]   or whatever, it's not just a simple case of looking
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:35.640]   in a spreadsheet where I happen to type in
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:37.240]   that I had dinner with this person
[00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:39.280]   and I spent this much on it and this is what we discussed.
[00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:41.720]   I actually have the physical receipt at hand,
[00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:43.680]   which has always been in my office.
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:46.680]   I just, for five years, I have to keep,
[00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:49.920]   it is literally just shopping bags full of paper receipts
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:51.800]   and what lately photocopy receipts to make sure
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:54.000]   that the ink on the receipt stays good.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:57.800]   This way, any kind of information I need to get my hands on,
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:52:59.560]   I get my hands on it instantly.
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:01.280]   I could not be happier with it.
[00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:03.680]   As a matter of fact, the new version of the Mac software
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:08.520]   is actually exceeds the feature set of the PC software
[00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:11.080]   in that you can just drag any image, any document,
[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:12.200]   anything into it.
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:14.120]   It's fully drag and drop aware.
[00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:16.800]   It is very, very easy to fix the rare mistakes
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:18.680]   that happen when it does OCR.
[00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:21.520]   The only troubles that I had with it last week
[00:53:21.520 --> 00:53:24.720]   where sometimes people get overly artistic
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:27.320]   and overly creative with their business cards
[00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:29.360]   and they're great when you're holding it in your hand,
[00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:31.120]   but a computer just basically says,
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:34.160]   "Oh, I will not allow you access to this porn site
[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:37.080]   "until you can reproduce these eight wobbly letters
[00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:38.480]   "on the business card."
[00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:40.160]   Other than that, it works great.
[00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:43.120]   The only thing that I wish it did
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:46.080]   and is that unfortunately, image capture
[00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:49.560]   is not really aware of its existence.
[00:53:49.560 --> 00:53:52.000]   So you can't simply use it with a Photoshop plugin
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:53.440]   or any of these other plugins.
[00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:56.840]   It's not the fault of neat receipts of the neat company.
[00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:59.120]   It's because it's a sheet fed scanner
[00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:03.560]   and the OS isn't really set up for machines
[00:54:03.560 --> 00:54:05.360]   that don't become a scanner
[00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:08.040]   until you actually physically load a piece of paper in.
[00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:10.680]   So you can't do a document preview, for instance,
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:12.040]   with the OS architecture.
[00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:13.240]   So that's the big hang up.
[00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:15.400]   But you can always just simply scan whatever it is
[00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:18.840]   using the Neats desktop scanner software
[00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:21.440]   and then just use that to export it into whatever you want.
[00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:23.920]   The last really good thing is that
[00:54:23.920 --> 00:54:26.080]   the only qualm that I had about this
[00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:28.880]   was the idea of trusting all of this data
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:31.680]   that I know is gonna be really, really important later on
[00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:34.120]   to some sort of proprietary library format
[00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:36.000]   and what happens if the software stops working,
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:37.640]   what happens if the company goes out of business
[00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:40.440]   and I need to pull something from a backup five years later.
[00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:42.440]   It does use a really cool,
[00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:45.000]   iPhoto-type library architecture,
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.960]   but the awesome thing is that your library
[00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:48.600]   is actually just a bundle.
[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:51.640]   So if you open the bundle inside the Finder,
[00:54:51.640 --> 00:54:54.400]   you will see just a huge pile of PDF files
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:56.720]   that you can then drag out and drag into any,
[00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:59.200]   use with any application anywhere.
[00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:01.040]   So it's just awesome.
[00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:02.560]   And it even comes with a little slip case,
[00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:05.600]   you can travel with it and it's so simple, so compact
[00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:08.160]   and it reduces your load packing for the trip home
[00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:10.240]   so greatly that you will wanna take it with you
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:11.080]   when you travel.
[00:55:11.080 --> 00:55:12.360]   - Yeah, I just got it to use with,
[00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:15.920]   I have a Fujitsu scan snap 300,
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:17.200]   which is a little bit bigger.
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:18.800]   It's probably like twice the size.
[00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:20.280]   - You don't have to use a neat receipt scanner.
[00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:21.120]   - No, you don't have to use,
[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:22.800]   you can actually buy the software separately
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:24.880]   and that it's far superior,
[00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:26.640]   the software is far superior to what comes
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:28.320]   with the Fujitsu scanner.
[00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:30.880]   And I just bought it and talked to them about it
[00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:33.280]   and actually the folks from Fujitsu at Macworld,
[00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:34.800]   we're sending people over to neat receipts going,
[00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:37.520]   we'll just get that software to go with this scanner.
[00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:38.360]   - Really?
[00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:40.400]   - And it is, the nice thing about the Fujitsu
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:42.440]   is you can do multi sheets.
[00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:44.880]   So you can throw like 10 sheets in and just hit go
[00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:46.320]   and it just starts pulling them through.
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:48.840]   It'll scan both sides at the same time,
[00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:49.880]   it'll move through it.
[00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:51.640]   It's a bit more expensive
[00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:54.680]   and it's definitely not as small and compact
[00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:56.080]   as the one that comes with neat receipts.
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:58.600]   But if you want a little bit more of a scanner,
[00:55:58.600 --> 00:56:00.440]   that's the scanner itself, that's what I'm using,
[00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:02.640]   but the neat receipts, I've just got it
[00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:04.880]   and just installed it and it's just,
[00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:05.880]   it seems awesome.
[00:56:05.880 --> 00:56:07.480]   The first couple tests were just amazing.
[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:09.560]   - We spent a lot of money with the desktop version,
[00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:10.720]   it's 450 bucks.
[00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:13.920]   How much is the Mac version?
[00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:17.360]   - The, I don't know what the retail price.
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:18.680]   - Andy, how much was it?
[00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:20.160]   - I think I paid 79 at the show.
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:21.640]   - 79, wow.
[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:23.080]   - That's just for the software.
[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:24.120]   - That's just for the software.
[00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:24.960]   That's just for the software.
[00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:26.440]   For the hardware and the software
[00:56:26.440 --> 00:56:28.080]   and I was looking something up
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:30.600]   and so I was navigated away from the page.
[00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:32.240]   - I think that on crisis today, I take a while.
[00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:34.120]   - I wanna say it's like $200.
[00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:35.520]   - I'm gonna say that the fast Mac is--
[00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:37.440]   - It's that bucks, just while you're looking.
[00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:41.520]   - Do not give me cool flash animation,
[00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:43.000]   give me text and a list of all.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.040]   - Because Mac version is 199 on the website.
[00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:46.560]   - 199 for the software only.
[00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:48.560]   - No, I think that that's the software and the hardware
[00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:50.320]   for the little scanner.
[00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:52.440]   - Right, if you already have a compatible scanner.
[00:56:52.440 --> 00:56:54.280]   - Oh, and the software is 80 bucks, okay.
[00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:56.000]   - If you already have a scanner, period,
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:57.720]   and you don't mind not having this really cool,
[00:56:57.720 --> 00:57:01.560]   tiny little like ruler sized USB scanner,
[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:02.560]   then that works just fine.
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:05.280]   There's apparently, there's--
[00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:07.040]   - Do you recommend getting the hardware, Andy?
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:09.880]   - I recommend getting the hardware.
[00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:12.960]   It's like I said, there's no external power supply
[00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:17.960]   there's, it works in a quick one step, one button operation.
[00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:21.400]   And this is one of those types of ideas
[00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:24.640]   where the fact that you have a device as compact,
[00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:27.320]   that you will want to take it everywhere,
[00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:29.640]   means that you will want to use it everywhere.
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:32.480]   This is not much used to you if everything,
[00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:34.440]   all your pieces of paper pile up into a box
[00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:36.040]   waiting for that time when you decide
[00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:39.160]   that you want to start to get to the iMac
[00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:41.200]   with a scanner attached to it and scan them all in a pile.
[00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:43.640]   It works best when you just simply have this thing
[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:45.960]   just even Velcro to the top of your iMac.
[00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:48.600]   I mean, it doesn't work with a new really cool
[00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:52.040]   like beveled top iMacs, but you can simply just
[00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:53.920]   Velcro it anywhere to the edge of your desk
[00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:55.480]   and just have it there always.
[00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:56.960]   And you just get in the habit of,
[00:57:56.960 --> 00:57:59.360]   okay, I'm home, my car keys go here,
[00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:01.000]   my iPod goes in the charger,
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:02.600]   and this back pocket full of paper receipts
[00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:04.200]   goes into the neat scanner.
[00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:06.200]   - Right, we use it like I'm telling you in the office,
[00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:07.200]   we live it.
[00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:09.440]   - I do want to make run recommendation
[00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:10.320]   to the neat company.
[00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:13.720]   What they need to do is produce like another device
[00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:15.600]   exactly the same shape and size that clicks
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:18.640]   onto the back of it so it shreds as it scans.
[00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:19.760]   (laughing)
[00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:21.320]   Yeah, that would be great.
[00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:22.880]   - Wouldn't that be funny?
[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:27.440]   You don't need it, so it shreds it, but it's got it.
[00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:28.680]   - Wow, that's kind of amazing.
[00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:30.880]   - Actually, believe it or not, I actually have been
[00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:32.400]   looking online to see if there's such a thing
[00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:36.000]   as a portable travel shredder because the whole idea
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:37.920]   of this is that I don't want to come back
[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:40.200]   from a trade show or a trip with any paper in my pocket.
[00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:43.480]   I don't have to worry about whether I scan this or not.
[00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:45.640]   And of course with receipts, I just want to leave nothing
[00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:49.120]   but the great taste of fresh lemon behind.
[00:58:49.120 --> 00:58:49.960]   (laughing)
[00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:51.960]   If there was like a little tiny little scanner,
[00:58:51.960 --> 00:58:54.720]   cross cut scanner, excuse me, cross cut shredder.
[00:58:54.720 --> 00:58:55.920]   - Shredder, shredder scanner.
[00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:57.520]   - I would try exactly.
[00:58:57.520 --> 00:58:59.320]   - No, it would be great to have one that just scans it.
[00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:00.840]   As long as we got to make sure the scan goes
[00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:02.560]   all the way through though, because it really--
[00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:05.400]   - Otherwise it's like, you only get one shot at this.
[00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:06.800]   - Well, the nice thing about this software,
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:08.400]   and you guys know this, but I'm just gonna tell people
[00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:10.200]   at home is that it does save the image
[00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:12.480]   and you can compare the OCR with the image.
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:14.800]   So sometimes it'll get numbers wrong or whatever.
[00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:16.160]   You can easily correct them.
[00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:17.720]   So Frederick scans it all and looks at it,
[00:59:17.720 --> 00:59:19.920]   makes sure everything is categorized.
[00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:22.120]   It goes to QuickBooks, and if there's any
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:23.520]   care cushions, she can easily do those.
[00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:24.360]   And that's really nice.
[00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:26.840]   - And it's only $249 for the scanner and the software.
[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:27.680]   And $199 for the--
[00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:29.800]   - You know, I have the Windows version
[00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:30.960]   that I bought a couple of years ago.
[00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:34.000]   I wonder if I can get the Mac software and use it.
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:36.200]   - Especially, it's the same package.
[00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:39.280]   When I first got in touch with them a few months ago,
[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:41.960]   they told me, "Oh wow, don't review the Mac software yet,
[00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:43.480]   "'cause we're doing great things from Mac world expo.
[00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:45.720]   "We'll send you the Windows package,
[00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:48.080]   "and then you can use the same software when you move up."
[00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:51.280]   So I'm willing to bet that if you have a compatible,
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:53.960]   Windows compatible scanner, it will work with the Mac version.
[00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:56.160]   - I should call them, 'cause it's really an upgrade.
[00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:57.160]   I wonder if they do a cross-grade,
[00:59:57.160 --> 00:59:58.560]   'cause the cross-grades are 30 bucks,
[00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:00.040]   or upgrades are 30 bucks.
[01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:01.920]   - And one that I bought was Neat Works,
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:02.760]   which is--
[01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:03.600]   - Right.
[01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:05.400]   - That's what I got for $79.
[01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:07.560]   - Neat Works for Mac, software kit,
[01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:10.040]   and they're still selling it for $79 online as well.
[01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:11.880]   So that's a great deal.
[01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:13.640]   Good recommendation, thank you, Andy.
[01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:16.720]   And last, but not least, Mr. Alex Lindsey.
[01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:19.000]   - So I travel a lot.
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.720]   - Oh really?
[01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:23.640]   I know you never think that I travel a lot.
[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:24.480]   - Really?
[01:00:24.480 --> 01:00:26.880]   - So I go a lot of places,
[01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:29.480]   and I need to take a lot more data
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:31.960]   than what I have on my computer.
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:34.360]   And oftentimes I just want to keep it separate,
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:39.120]   because it's just lots and lots of my presentation files,
[01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:41.960]   movie files, test files, class files, so on and so forth.
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:45.040]   Also, when we're, a lot of times when we're shooting on set,
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:47.160]   you know, when we're shooting from an XDCam,
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:48.480]   or whatever we're downloading,
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:49.960]   we want to download the external drives.
[01:00:49.960 --> 01:00:52.480]   And so we go through a lot of external drives.
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:53.680]   We deal with a lot of these.
[01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:55.480]   And the one that we,
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:59.560]   that we are buying, sometimes it feels like by the bushel,
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:04.040]   are these Lacy Rugged Mobile Drives.
[01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:05.080]   - Have you seen these?
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:06.880]   - Yes, they have rubber on them.
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:07.880]   - They're rubber on them.
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:09.880]   I don't know how much difference the rubber makes,
[01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:10.720]   but it bounces.
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:12.120]   - But one of the things that's really great
[01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:16.240]   about these Lacys is that they have,
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:17.880]   the interface really, really works.
[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:20.320]   So you have, I have a USB interface,
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:22.920]   I have Firewire 400, and I have Firewire 800.
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:23.760]   - Oh, I like that.
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:25.000]   - And I have external power.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.160]   So if for some reason I have a USB connection
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:30.320]   that doesn't have, I can actually power this,
[01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:32.200]   you know, with the external power that's there.
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:33.400]   - I love that.
[01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:37.680]   - It is a, you know, we just, we buy a lot of these.
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:41.000]   They've come to a really low price on Amazon.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:45.920]   I think they're $200 for a 500 gig portable drive
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:46.760]   that you can throw in.
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:49.040]   So it's very, and we've gone, you know,
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:52.480]   we have probably, I don't know, at least,
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:53.960]   in the office right now, we have five or six,
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:55.040]   but we mail them around.
[01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:56.200]   These are our transport drives.
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:59.360]   So a lot of times when we're mailing big files to clients,
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:00.200]   literally we'll just--
[01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:01.040]   - You just send them a file.
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:03.160]   - We just drove them all on the Lacy
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:04.840]   and we mail it to them.
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:06.880]   And you just throw it in a FedEx pack,
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:08.720]   I mean, wrap it sometimes a little bit of bubble wrap.
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:11.640]   But outside of that, we just send them out and--
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:13.240]   - What's the biggest size they have?
[01:02:13.240 --> 01:02:14.080]   500 is the biggest.
[01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:16.920]   - 500 gigs is right now, the largest that they have available.
[01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:18.680]   - I love it, they have 800 and 400 in the USB.
[01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:19.520]   - Well, that's the big thing.
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:21.120]   It's not just the fact that it's rugged.
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:23.720]   I don't know how rugged it is compared to the other ones,
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:26.400]   but it is awesome to know that when you're,
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:28.080]   when I'm going around no matter what computer
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:30.440]   is sitting in front of me, I can take it full advantage
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:31.960]   of the speed if I need it,
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:34.360]   or I can take advantage of the compatibility
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:35.440]   if I wanna use USB.
[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:38.280]   I mean, 'cause USB, we've gotten some USB drives only
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:42.840]   and it's just horrid because they take more CPU power.
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:43.680]   - It's really slow.
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:46.080]   - They're slower, so the thing is you want 800
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:50.680]   when you have 800, but if I'm giving you something
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:53.360]   on you of a Mac book, I need to be able to make sure
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:54.760]   that I throw it on this, but now you can,
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:56.080]   I know that I can just hand you this drive,
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:57.560]   not worrying about it, so I get the speed
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:02:58.720]   and you get the compatibility.
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:00.720]   - Well, and with the Mac Pro, it drives me crazy
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:02.200]   because it only has an 800 port,
[01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:04.600]   so I always have to find 800 to 400 cables,
[01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:07.040]   and so it's nice if it has 800 as a choice.
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:07.880]   I think that's just great.
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:10.040]   - So anyway, these are great, great drives,
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:12.040]   and as I said, we just bought a bunch more.
[01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:14.840]   - Lost seat, 200 bucks for 500 terabytes.
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:15.680]   - That's correct.
[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:16.520]   - I'm sorry, gigabytes.
[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:17.360]   - I think the list price is like--
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:17.620]   - I don't think they have a 500-
[01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:17.620]   - Yeah, 500-
[01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:18.460]   - Yeah, 500-
[01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:20.480]   - Yeah, not yet, but it's soon.
[01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:21.400]   - How long can it be?
[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:22.240]   I mean, you know--
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:25.240]   - Well, when you're making XD cards
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:26.400]   that are gonna have two terabytes.
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:28.600]   - Two terabytes.
[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:31.240]   - It's the size of your pinky nail.
[01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:32.240]   I mean, when you think about that,
[01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:33.960]   that means I can throw, I can throw,
[01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:35.080]   I'll be able to throw a memory card
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:38.240]   in the side of my camera and shoot the rest of the year.
[01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:39.160]   - Yeah, if I wanted to.
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:40.000]   - I'm totally cool.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.040]   - It's gonna be amazing, so anyway.
[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:43.200]   So the name is, I know it's LaCie, L-A-C-I-E.
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:44.160]   - It's the rugged drive.
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:45.200]   - Rugged drive, okay.
[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:47.160]   - And they are rugged.
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:49.800]   We've had one where the,
[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:51.680]   we haven't had anywhere the disk actually failed.
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:54.040]   We've had one where the port burned out,
[01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:56.040]   but 800s are kind of prone to that.
[01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:57.920]   800 connections.
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:58.920]   We found burnout.
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:03:59.760]   - Oh, really?
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:02.320]   - Yeah, we found that they fail more than any other connection.
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:03.280]   - Oh, that's depressing.
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:05.280]   - They're really fast while they last.
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:06.280]   But we use our hardware.
[01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:08.400]   - That's bad because both my,
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:10.240]   but I guess my backup pro only has an 800,
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:11.560]   so if it burns out, I'm gonna be in.
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:16.560]   - Well, we haven't, we've had all of our G5 front 800 ports.
[01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:17.840]   So, are we on?
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:18.680]   - Wow, wow.
[01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:19.520]   - Well, you guys use them like that.
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:20.360]   - But we use them very hard.
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:21.520]   They have a polygamous relationship
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:24.320]   with lots of users and drives and everything else.
[01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:26.240]   And so, that tends to,
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:28.400]   computers tend to like to have an agamous relationship.
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:29.720]   She started having lots of people using them,
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:31.720]   and they start to fall apart.
[01:04:31.720 --> 01:04:33.120]   That's been our experience.
[01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:36.160]   - Safe firewire, I'm big on that.
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:37.880]   - Well, thank you all for being here,
[01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:40.680]   and thank you, Andy, Andy and Akos at the Chicago Sun Times,
[01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:42.800]   and also his website.
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:45.080]   There he is waving, little Andy's waving.
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:47.640]   At cwob.com, we have a picture,
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:49.520]   we have one shot that we use on the video,
[01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:51.040]   and for those listening to how I apologize
[01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:51.880]   for mentioning the video,
[01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:54.440]   but it's where the guy is kind of a little,
[01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:55.560]   tiny guy right in front of me,
[01:04:55.560 --> 01:04:57.200]   and I just love that shot.
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:58.040]   (laughing)
[01:04:58.040 --> 01:04:59.680]   - Little Andy, he's on my desk.
[01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:02.960]   cwob.com, thanks for joining us again, Andy.
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:04.720]   What is the weather like right now in Boston?
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:05.560]   Is it really awful?
[01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:06.400]   - Pretty cool.
[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:08.320]   - Yeah, Arctic, they said.
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:09.640]   - Yeah, I was trying to trick you to think
[01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:11.320]   the video had frozen by not moving my phone.
[01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:12.160]   - That was really good.
[01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:13.000]   You did fool me, actually.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:13.840]   You scared me.
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:15.320]   (laughing)
[01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:17.240]   - If only I could pixelate the hell of a sun
[01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:19.000]   where part of the image is pixelated.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:19.840]   - Yeah.
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:23.280]   - Yeah, it's gonna be, well, I guess the good news
[01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:24.720]   about the cold weather up here is that,
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:26.600]   obviously I didn't shovel the snow for a whole week
[01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:28.320]   while I was way at Mac world Expo,
[01:05:28.320 --> 01:05:30.520]   and by the time I got back, things had frozen so well
[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:32.960]   that my car has not parked very neatly on top
[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:34.720]   of about six inches of snow in my driveway.
[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:36.600]   So no need to do any shuffling.
[01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:37.920]   That was something I was worried about.
[01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:40.280]   - So Andy, I have one more question for you.
[01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:42.720]   Where did you get that sweatshirt?
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:43.800]   - What does it say?
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:44.640]   - Oh, it's a sky.
[01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:45.840]   - I recognize the sweatshirt.
[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:49.320]   - Yes, my Skywalker ranch, fire and EME EMS t-shirt.
[01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:50.160]   - Wow.
[01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:52.320]   - That would be from my tour of Industrial Light and Magic
[01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:55.480]   and Lucasfilm, which I did last week at Mac world Expo.
[01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:58.960]   Of course, you can't just show up and get a tour.
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:00.880]   You have to be somewhat incredibly powerful
[01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:02.040]   and special like my show.
[01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:03.880]   (laughing)
[01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:05.320]   - I used to give those tours.
[01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:09.520]   - They have an employee store,
[01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:13.240]   and fortunately there's an ATM outside the store.
[01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:14.080]   - They're smart.
[01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:14.920]   - I said fools.
[01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:16.800]   - When I was interviewed by Lucasfilm,
[01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:18.800]   I was pretty sure that there was an absolutely no chance
[01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:19.800]   they were gonna hire me.
[01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:23.680]   And so I went to the, I actually went to,
[01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:27.000]   when I got to the general store at the ranch,
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.040]   I think I spent like $300.
[01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:30.880]   - You know, just buying shirts and sweatshirts,
[01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:32.400]   I was like, I'm gonna give it to my friends,
[01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:33.400]   at least I got this.
[01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:34.240]   And it was really good.
[01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:35.720]   - I was like, on my iPhone's sake,
[01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:38.520]   is this available for sale anywhere else in the store?
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:39.680]   No, yes, okay.
[01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:41.160]   - Yes, unique.
[01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:42.680]   Well, I have to say, I like it that you got
[01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:44.920]   the fire department, the fire department shirt.
[01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:45.760]   That, I mean, that's--
[01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:46.920]   - That's my first press thing, my old this.
[01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:48.880]   Oh, well, I got it during my tour of Industrial Light,
[01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:50.760]   Magic and Lucasfilm, but you can't get it,
[01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:52.120]   as a civilian.
[01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:53.720]   - That's my important.
[01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:54.560]   - Well, it worked,
[01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:57.800]   'cause you got the attention of Mr. Lindsey here.
[01:06:57.800 --> 01:06:59.720]   - Well, the great thing about it is that on day like this,
[01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:00.640]   it's warm.
[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:02.560]   - Yeah, it's high quality stuff.
[01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:04.440]   Well, stay warm, we're actually sweating bullets here.
[01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:06.640]   It was 81 degrees yesterday in Petaloma.
[01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:07.480]   - Master it's not.
[01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:09.320]   - I know, I don't understand what's going on.
[01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:11.800]   This is very unseasonable weather for us.
[01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:13.000]   But Alex and I are enjoying it.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:14.480]   Alex Lindsey is in studio with us.
[01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:16.360]   He's moved up our way, and it's so nice to have you.
[01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:17.840]   In fact, you can start using the offices.
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:18.680]   - Yep.
[01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:20.440]   - Very pleased about that.
[01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:21.800]   Alex is at Pixel Core.
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:23.000]   That's the great place to go.
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.560]   If you wanna be a multimedia artist,
[01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:28.080]   you get the training and the work.
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:29.440]   Kind of a nice combination.
[01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:31.400]   PixelCore.com, find out more about it there.
[01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:32.600]   And of course, the podcasts,
[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:34.320]   including this week in photography,
[01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:38.240]   Tope Photo, are available for pixelcore.tv.
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:40.680]   - And we're going to have mackerel coverage
[01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:41.920]   for the next three weeks.
[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:43.760]   - You've got how many segments did you shoot?
[01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:47.480]   - We shot a total of, including the green screen stuff,
[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:49.400]   we shot about 52 episodes.
[01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:51.920]   (laughing)
[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:52.760]   - You're insane!
[01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:54.640]   - So we shot 30 on the floor,
[01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:56.280]   and then we shot 22 in the studio.
[01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:58.280]   We shot 16 Macbrake studios,
[01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:00.800]   and they are the best Macbrake studios ever.
[01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:01.680]   The guys have taken it over.
[01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:03.920]   They're like literally, I'm not even on the show anymore.
[01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:07.240]   - And who are the guys who's on these Macbrake studios?
[01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:12.240]   - Oh, Brian Gary, Steve Martin, and Mark Spencer,
[01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:13.800]   and then they're bringing on guests.
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:15.640]   They were the guests before I was the host.
[01:08:15.640 --> 01:08:16.480]   They were the guests.
[01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:17.320]   - Right.
[01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:18.280]   - And now they're the hosts,
[01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:20.360]   and they're bringing on incredible people
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:21.360]   to talk about that stuff.
[01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:22.200]   - We also need it.
[01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:24.880]   - We also recorded our first Macbrake work,
[01:08:24.880 --> 01:08:27.520]   which is going to be all based on stuff you need at work
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:28.440]   if you're using your Mac.
[01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:33.360]   And then we're recording Macbrake Dev this week with Sal.
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:34.880]   Some more cool Macbrake Devs.
[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:37.480]   - And you use Justine, I know, for the Macbrakes.
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:40.360]   Justine, we had-- - Lisa Bettany.
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:42.760]   - Lisa Bettany, Kirsten Sanford.
[01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:44.120]   We also had--
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:45.640]   - Merlin, did "Cyber Johnson."
[01:08:45.640 --> 01:08:46.480]   - Fred. - Merlin, Fred.
[01:08:46.480 --> 01:08:47.920]   - Merlin was on, we had something that already came out
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:48.840]   with Merlin last week.
[01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:49.680]   - Right.
[01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:51.880]   - And so those are going to be all coming out this month,
[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:55.240]   and then in February, the new shows that are really going
[01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:57.120]   after specific areas.
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:08:58.800]   Justine's going to be doing an iPhone show with us.
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:08:59.960]   - Is she perfect?
[01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:00.880]   - Yeah, so-- - Perfect.
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:02.880]   I've never seen anybody more attached
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:04.560]   to a device in my life.
[01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:05.520]   (laughing)
[01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:07.480]   So that's all at pixelcore.tv.
[01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:08.520]   We thank you for being here.
[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:09.600]   Don't forget you can listen to this show
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:10.440]   and all our shows.
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:13.280]   And of course, you can listen on the website, twit.tv,
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:15.040]   but we encourage you to go to iTunes
[01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:16.960]   and subscribe, that way you'll get every show.
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:20.240]   The minute it comes out, if you go to the iTunes Music Store,
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:21.840]   click the podcast link, and on the left
[01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:24.560]   you'll see twit.tv as one of the providers,
[01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:25.920]   featured providers, click that link,
[01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:29.080]   'cause that's a whole, that's all the shows that we have.
[01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:31.560]   We also want to thank those of you who contribute.
[01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:32.840]   You know, somebody gave me a good idea.
[01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:35.400]   It's apparently Todd Rungren calls the people
[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:39.760]   who will donate to his cause patrons,
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:41.480]   like a patron of the art.
[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:43.000]   You no longer have to be a Medici.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.200]   You no longer have to be a millionaire
[01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:45.920]   to be a patron of the arts.
[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:47.280]   If you want to be one of our patrons,
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:50.760]   all we ask $2 a month, it really helps us out paying the rent,
[01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:52.760]   paying the staff, getting the bandwidth.
[01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:54.800]   Yes, we have advertisers, but they come and go.
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:56.480]   It's the donations, the patrons,
[01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:58.280]   that make such a difference to a twit,
[01:09:58.280 --> 01:09:59.960]   and you can donate to our cause.
[01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:01.680]   By going to twit.tv, you'll see buttons
[01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:02.760]   over there on the left.
[01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:04.400]   Yes, there's five and $10 buttons,
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:05.760]   but really $2 is all I ask,
[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:08.400]   just a cup of coffee a day, oh, a month.
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:09.240]   That's all I ask.
[01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:10.080]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:11.200]   We really appreciate it.
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:13.200]   Another Mac break is broke.
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:15.780]   (upbeat music)
[01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:20.780]   (upbeat music)
[01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:23.360]   (upbeat music)
