[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.640]   Very important zero day flaw.
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.640]   There's a fix for Mac OS and iOS.

[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.680]   We'll talk a little bit about that.
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.800]   And Apple TV plus finally has a big hit plus all the rumors.
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.560]   It's all coming up next on Mac break.

[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.760]   The show we cover the latest news from Apple with Mr.
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.360]   Alex Lindsey of office hours, fame, oh, nine, oh, dot media office hours dot global.
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.080]   Hello. Hello.
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.680]   You were it was funny because I was before the show recording a Q and A.
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.320]   We're doing for a new tech for their for a piece they're putting out and we'll let you know when they put that out.
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:36.240]   And they asked about video and why do you put why do you put all this energy in the lighting and set and Alex is like making faces and sending me thumbs out.
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.800]   Thank you for the moral support.
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.560]   I appreciate it.
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.960]   You do a little bit more than than we do.
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.280]   I must say, but I prefer just a laptop and the computer.
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.720]   Sure.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.360]   You got a little ring like you bought for eBay for 20.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.480]   I didn't get a blank ring light.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.080]   I just point.
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.960]   I just try to get to the nearest window that makes sense.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.920]   Yeah, that's actually you know, in some ways, a single point light from a window.
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.760]   Good lights are probably good enough for a while.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.400]   If we had windows in the studio, it might be not predictable.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.560]   Yeah.
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.960]   Right.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:05.280]   Yeah.
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.240]   So the sun goes down.
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.720]   Interface.
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.560]   I thought when in the old studio in the break house, we built the, you know, it was a storefront.
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.360]   So we had these big pains, big like last windows.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.480]   I thought, I'll be so great.
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.280]   Well, and the sun was so bright, come and slanting in because it faced West all afternoon that we actually had a
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.760]   cover them up basically because we could.
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.040]   We always, we always, the people saying, well, let's shoot at sunset and we're always
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.080]   like, ah, do you really want to do that?
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.920]   Like, I got a light I can make yellow.
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:31.680]   Let's just do that.
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.200]   What do you say?
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.520]   Also with us, Mr. Andy and I go from WG B H in Boston.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.280]   Hello Andrew.
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.760]   Hello.
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.400]   Yeah.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.760]   It's no natural sunlight from window works great.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.560]   So long as you can afford one of those fancy office chair that swivels.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.880]   You just got to like, follow the sun.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.280]   So once you put your entire desk on a turntable so that like over the course of the show, the house is actually on a
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:57.120]   servo mechanism that keeps it pointing West.
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.960]   All to avoid having to afford a $40 LED light.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:10.040]   And Renee Ritchie, who does care about quality because he's a YouTuber, YouTube.com/Renee Ritchie.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.840]   Look at that set.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.040]   It's getting fancier by the minute.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.440]   I got sharks, sharks, sharks, like as black as klags in the back.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.360]   What I do is I set my webcam.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.040]   It's already bad.
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.640]   It's already potato.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.240]   I set it to 480p and then I use the Safari interface to light me.
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.960]   And then if I forget and I change windows, it just goes down to nothing and you have to you have to cope with that line.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:34.680]   Actually, I wouldn't recommend the Safari interface for lighting.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.640]   Although I have.
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.080]   Better.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.640]   I have.
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:38.880]   Let me let me.
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.760]   That's kind of what Steve Gibson used.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.880]   He's got a big bright monitor in front of him and I can tell when he's gone dark mode.
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.000]   Because suddenly you can't see him very well.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.600]   Actually, an interesting article about Safari, Perry sun.com for developers.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:57.120]   Apple Safari is crap and outdated.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:09.280]   He says his complaints are several first apples poor, supportive, progressive web apps, which he says is to protect their app store revenue.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.760]   I do wish they they do support it, but they don't support it that well.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.680]   They're not alone. Firefox dumped its support for progressive web apps recently as well, which is too bad.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:20.120]   I think I think the reason that they don't support it is not many people use it.
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.600]   I think nobody I think if a lot of people used it, they would support it.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.560]   But it's a cash 22 until Apple's.
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.840]   You know, it's the same thing with spatial audio.
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.240]   Nobody used it until Apple says, Oh, spatial.
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.400]   I don't think it's that though.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.600]   I think it's I think it's profound.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.080]   It's a profound profound a profound difference in the way that people see the web.
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.080]   And it's not that they that a lot of people don't use it.
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.800]   It is huge.
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.640]   If you look at using electron app, you're essentially using a packaged web app.
[00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.240]   Everything from Slack to Discord.
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.840]   All of those are web apps that are instantiated through Electron.
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.280]   It's why Microsoft ended up dumping their own rendering engine and going with Chromium
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.840]   because they got all of that for free and they they just didn't have a healthy native.
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.160]   App ecosystem anymore.
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.320]   And they had to go in with web apps.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.920]   I think that's the huge difference is that Apple has a vibrant native app ecosystem.
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.080]   And they don't they believe that that's a better fundamentally better, more power
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.520]   efficient, more secure, more private infrastructure for handling web apps and Google
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.280]   doesn't Google.
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.760]   They have Android because they had to, but it never felt very googly.
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.560]   WebOS was felt more googly and this definitely progressive web apps feel super googly,
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.120]   but it's a dis it's a disagreement about the future of the web that they haven't
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.800]   they haven't solved yet.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.880]   And I also unfortunately, while Chrome has like something like 90% market share.
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:39.240]   And if you could chromium engines, a huge market share, but I don't think we want
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.480]   a monoculture either.
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:45.440]   I think what we'd like is a very vibrant competitive Safari web kit and a very
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:49.120]   vibrant and competitive Firefox uses that much battery because in part of a
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:50.680]   little bit of service that maybe that's it.
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.240]   Maybe that's it.
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.000]   Because that's heavy, heavy stuff.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.800]   Well, service workers, things like that.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.680]   Apple does does did kind of dragging its feet, did support.
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.760]   Support partially, but you can't do notifications.
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:01.960]   Quite a few things you can't do.
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:05.960]   He also complains that it's support for web RTC is lagging,
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.520]   which is probably true.
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.880]   That's a that is a technology that is not explicitly Google, but came from Google
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.160]   and is kind of seen as a Google technology.
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:20.440]   And it's not as stable as we'd like it.
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.000]   Yeah, you know about web RTC.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.240]   Yeah.
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:25.240]   I mean, we do a lot of stuff with web RTC and zoom itself.
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:31.160]   What we're coming in on is is a flavor of web RTC with a lot of extra special
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:31.720]   sauce on it.
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.280]   And the issue is web RTC in itself is pretty powerful.
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.640]   The real problem you get into is it doesn't transverse
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:38.880]   complex networks very well.
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.120]   And so it just becomes a lot of work.
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.360]   And so why we don't tend to use it.
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.360]   So why we stopped using OBS Ninja, which is a great tool, but our complex network
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:51.000]   and some of our contributors complex network made it not such a great choice.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.360]   It just means that you can't turn it on and have it just work.
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.240]   Like, you know, and a lot of times, which was the promise of web RTC.
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.040]   I might add.
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.840]   It was a browser.
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:00.600]   You don't need an app.
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:05.280]   Apparently Apple's support for WebRTC is there, but it's buggy.
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.200]   And developers find it.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.880]   What the new FaceTime users, I think, so they're going to have to rapidly
[00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.880]   improve that if they're interesting experience on Android and Windows.
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.040]   But the bigger one, and I think one we would care more about is bugs and infrequent
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:23.000]   updates, unlike Chrome or Firefox Safari updates are not automatic on a regular basis.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.360]   Although Apple has a lot of late been pushing out more updates.
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.440]   It's interesting.
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.960]   There's going to be a real battle over the next Safari.
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:34.160]   Some people really hate what they're doing in the next Safari.
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:35.160]   They've walked it back.
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.360]   So even today, they walked it back again.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:37.880]   Yeah.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:38.520]   Yeah.
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:44.520]   I use Safari on my Mac book because of the battery life, but also it does.
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.120]   I mean, it's natively integrated into keychain.
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.440]   And it's all right.
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.680]   Also, if you want to watch anything that I deal with HDR, if you want to
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:56.280]   watch anything with HDR space and you know, you can't really do it on the other
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.760]   browsers very well.
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:58.080]   Yeah.
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:02.440]   Anyway, I bring that up not for any reason, but just because you mentioned Safari.
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.040]   So I thought, well, we'll mention this.
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.960]   Actually, probably the most important story of the week is that there is a update
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:14.560]   today to the update from last week, 14.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:19.480]   You've always said this, Alex, never download the first update, 14.7.
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:23.160]   You also say, don't download the second update, download the third update,
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.080]   which will fix the blocks they're introducing with the blue up.
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.760]   It's like it's like a little stutter step that you got to do right behind the line
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:30.640]   before you go through the whole.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.080]   It's kind of just like wait for all the blockers to do their thing.
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:33.880]   And then you move through.
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:39.600]   In this case, I might not think it's a good idea to wait because iOS 14.7.1,
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.200]   which came out today and Mac OS 11.5.
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:46.520]   Point one, fix a zero day.
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.280]   So it might be kind of important.
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.560]   This is it a Pegasus zero day?
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.360]   We're not sure, but we think it might be.
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.600]   Yeah, that seems to be the consensus.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:59.200]   No one knows exactly, but that seems to be the consensus.
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:02.160]   It's a zero day that will allow.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:08.120]   This is this is for iOS, iPad, OS and Mac OS from Apple support hub.
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.120]   I owe mobile frame buffer available for iPhone 6s.
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:16.680]   And later iPad Pro iPad air to iPad 5th gen mini iPod touch.
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:22.400]   An application may be able to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:28.560]   Apple is aware of a report that this issue that this for you, Apple.
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.560]   Yes, we are aware of a report that this issue.
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.160]   May have been actively exploited.
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:36.840]   It's a memory corruption.
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:38.120]   When they're there,
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.840]   continuous support for devices going back five years hurts them as much as it helps us.
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:42.240]   Yeah.
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.280]   Yeah, we want them to do that.
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.320]   Yeah, we want them to do that.
[00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:50.200]   But so it's still whenever you see an update that comes right on the heels or
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:54.280]   freeze update, you know that something's just bad has happened and that you really,
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.800]   really should have to download this.
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:56.120]   Yeah.
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:00.440]   It's either a bad bug or in this case, it's a security issue.
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:05.080]   And that's probably probably not one to to wait for.
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:10.880]   That's their 13th zero day fix by the way this year, just which I don't think is an apple thing.
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.160]   I think everybody's doing it.
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:12.440]   Right.
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:15.800]   I think the bad guys are very aggressive out there.
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:22.280]   Still, but it makes it nostalgic for the days when Apple used to crow about how, oh boy,
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:25.240]   what are you glad you're using an Apple product?
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:30.000]   Not one of those insecure, terrible, terrible week security devices
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.880]   from Google or somebody else or Windows.
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:37.560]   And you're right, it's not a reflection on Apple dropping the ball.
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:43.040]   It's a reflection on exactly how complicated these things have gotten, partly because of the
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:46.600]   exploding marketplace from malware at this point.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:49.920]   It really is a turnkey operation for so many things at this point.
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:54.520]   And this from the record, you might another reason why you want to patch it quickly.
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:11:01.360]   Shortly after the patch of security researcher published proof of concept code
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:06.280]   for the vulnerability on his Twitter timeline and a second security researcher
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:09.880]   who says, I found this independently published a detailed write up of the issue,
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:15.440]   which he said he was preparing to report to Apple before he was surprised to find out
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.880]   that the US maker had patched it.
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:20.760]   So in other words, if there's proof of concept code out there,
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.720]   it's only a matter of time before people start writing their own.
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:29.080]   So no longer is it merely the domain of Pegasus?
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:31.760]   All of you now can do the same thing.
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:35.640]   And I think also we just probably want to consider the scale of things.
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:39.240]   I mean, you know, Apple's posting a lot of patches doesn't mean how many of them have
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.640]   actually been exploited or at any kind of scale.
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.000]   I mean, we have entire cities getting shut down on.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.280]   I understand those aren't those aren't.
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:49.280]   But these 13 patches are zero days, which means they're in the wild.
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:52.000]   They're in the wild, but we don't know what the numbers are.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:52.440]   Yeah. Yeah.
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:58.960]   You know, well, in the case of the the Pegasus, it was a small number of targeted individuals.
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:05.160]   But once it's once the codes published, that suddenly can go to a large number of people.
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.880]   You don't particularly care that this is this is only affected 2,000 people.
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:12.080]   If you're one of the people gets it gets affected.
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:12.440]   That's true.
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:16.320]   So especially if you're a journalist or a dissident in the country where they absolutely
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:16.800]   have a fix it.
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.720]   I'm just saying when people worry about it, I know.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.880]   Yeah, you know, especially.
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.840]   And I probably don't have to worry about it. Actually, you do.
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.560]   You do. You do work for big, big, big people.
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.760]   You probably should pay more attention.
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.400]   What do you do? Do you Alex, given, you know,
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:35.160]   I think you've mentioned that you've spent some time in the White House, not, I don't
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.960]   know, lately, but in the past White House, she's white.
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:38.800]   I love to say.
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.240]   Somebody's a house that is white.
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:43.880]   But do you what do you do for security?
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:47.960]   You obviously have a higher duty on a day to day basis.
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.200]   Right now, I'm not doing any of those kinds of things.
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:55.960]   So when we locked down for events, last fall, we spent a lot of time that we were most likely
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.880]   a target of state actors.
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:01.160]   And so, or at least a potential target for state actors.
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.640]   And so, due to the nature of our work.
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:07.560]   And so we, you know, we have a lot of security.
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:10.560]   My phone for, you know, my phone was something that I didn't.
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:13.960]   The phone that I used for that number one, we didn't discuss anything on it.
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:16.160]   We kept everything on phone calls.
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:21.920]   But also, you don't let it, you don't use messages like you use signal, you know, for that.
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:24.720]   And even then you worry about everything that you're typing.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.440]   Signal is set to usually a 24 hour deletion.
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.640]   So it just keeps on wiping, you know, as you're working.
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:35.920]   And then, you know, a lot of extra security, the computers don't touch other computers.
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.920]   You know, like they, they kind of do what they need to do.
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.280]   And the only ones that need to touch the internet, touch the internet.
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:45.280]   You get really paranoid about everybody who sends you anything.
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:50.200]   So every link, every email, every, when someone sends you a, they don't use blind
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:53.920]   CC when my, when my kids, teachers send, don't send me things that don't.
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:54.720]   It tries me nuts.
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:55.480]   Include blind CC.
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:56.400]   They get a quick email from me.
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.440]   That's as nice as I can make it.
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.160]   But like, Hey, you're putting this all at risk, you know, like that is the.
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:04.360]   Um, you know, that is, uh, you know, it tries to be a piece of that.
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.120]   Lot of people.
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:09.280]   So, so we were kind of frankly, Alex, every time an app asks you to share your
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:13.840]   contact list, the, the whoever shares their contact list is sharing your every.
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:14.600]   All that a clubhouse.
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:15.280]   Did you see that?
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:18.320]   How many phone numbers got compromised on Clubhouse over the weekend?
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:19.040]   There you go.
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:21.320]   I rest in my case.
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:23.760]   It was millions, millions of phone numbers, including people from
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:26.320]   like celebrities government.
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:26.680]   Yeah.
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:31.400]   And of course, clubhouse, like all these apps say, well, uh, if you want to know when
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:35.480]   your friend joins, just to share your house list with this.
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.280]   I did it.
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.280]   I have to admit on my, on my personal phone.
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:44.480]   Um, but the more I, it was the number one thing to turn me off.
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:45.840]   Like I just was like, I'm not going to do this.
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.400]   I don't want to even encourage people to use it.
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.000]   Do you bring in a consultant?
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:49.520]   Do you have?
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:50.640]   Uh, yeah.
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:54.280]   No, our consultant, well, we had a really good consultant for last fall.
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:55.320]   So that's okay.
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:55.920]   So there you go.
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:56.720]   Yeah.
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.160]   I mean, because it was hard.
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:03.880]   And even though you're a very sophisticated user, uh, you really want to bring in
[00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:05.480]   somebody who really, this is their job.
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:06.680]   This is what they do all the time.
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:10.080]   I mean, fundamentally, the other thing you have to understand is that you can be
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:10.600]   leveraged.
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:14.440]   And so the main thing is, is that, um, you just get really careful about what you
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:16.720]   put in email, what you put in texts.
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:19.720]   Um, you know, even what you say over the phone, you just worry about it.
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:20.480]   You think about it.
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:24.080]   Um, you just know that everything, everything like that can be used against you.
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.800]   And one of the things is that you just don't do anything interesting.
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:31.200]   Like I don't do anything interesting on the web, you know, like that, that would
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.120]   get that I couldn't explain.
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:36.560]   I don't, at this point, I don't do anything on the web that I can't explain to my
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.840]   wife, to the government, to the press, to the public, to the, like, there's no,
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:44.160]   if I can't explain, I won't do it because it's just assumed that everything you
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:46.280]   do on the internet is public, basically.
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:46.480]   Yeah.
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:47.160]   Yeah.
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:51.000]   Uh, cause it could be at some point, including joining clubhouse and your phone number.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.880]   Um, but that doesn't, that's a, that's a part of it, but it's, but there's also
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:16:00.000]   the issue of being hacked as a gate, like, as a gateway.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.800]   If your laptop got hacked and then you bring it inside the white house and now
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:06.040]   you're joining a white house network, you could be bringing in stuff.
[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:07.040]   Yeah.
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.040]   So there's all sorts of other issues as well.
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:14.520]   You're, you know, yeah, I mean, it's, there's a lot of, there's a lot of security there.
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:18.680]   So related to that, the biggest problem you have when you plug into something like
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:22.720]   the white, we'll just say something like the white house is, is that, that you know,
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.480]   that you're basically plugging into the NSA.
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:28.120]   So as soon as you plug your computer, so it goes both ways, is what you're saying.
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:28.360]   Yeah.
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:28.400]   Yeah.
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:32.480]   Like as soon as you plug that ethernet in, you're saying hello, you can see it scanning.
[00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:36.720]   And it just like, it just scans, it scans everything all the way down to the, to the
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:39.720]   firmware. So it's, it's, yeah.
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:45.000]   So you're the most, like you think Pegasus, just think of that times 10, you're plugging
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:45.760]   your computer into it.
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:51.160]   So we did not plug our personal computers into, into, into ethernet there.
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:52.560]   So yeah.
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:57.000]   And that's primarily, yeah, we had fiber, video fiber, like there's video fiber that goes
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.200]   out of the white house that goes into another building.
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:00.720]   That's where our master control was.
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:02.440]   So we didn't really need to stream from it.
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:06.400]   You just get, you just hook literally a SDI cable up and it just shows up.
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.600]   Somewhere else that goes through.
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:09.960]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:10.920]   It's not the public internet.
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:13.080]   It's a, it's a, it's just a, it's just fine.
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:13.960]   It's a big pipe.
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:14.440]   It's the pipe.
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:20.800]   We should mention that clubhouse leak, which was claimed to be 1.3 million scraped
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:24.480]   user records from a SQL database.
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:26.840]   Now clubhouse is denying that.
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:32.280]   And others are saying it's probably not a breach.
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:40.480]   So, you know, that's a, that's a, in, in progress clubhouse says, I'll, I'll read
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:45.080]   their statement that actually the chatroom posted here.
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:45.960]   Thank you, chatroom.
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:49.000]   They're very quick on the draw that they're in the event.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:49.440]   Let's see.
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:52.080]   Uh, there are a series of bots.
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:57.480]   The folks, the spokesperson said that generates billions of random phone numbers
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:01.440]   in the event that one of these random phone numbers happens to exist in our
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.400]   platform due to mathematical coincidence.
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:09.000]   Clubhouse API returns no user identifiable information.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:15.840]   Um, so there seems to be a, a disagreement over what happened.
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:19.360]   It's still good to reexamine your, your practices.
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:23.320]   Like I ordered, I ordered the new 50 millimeter RF lens for the Canon system.
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:24.680]   I just had to, it looks so good.
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:28.480]   And then the camera company texted me saying, please give us a review with an
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:31.480]   obscure short form link and I like, you know, you don't text people who have
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:32.480]   scared links anymore.
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:36.720]   I just wrote back when this is not a very good idea.
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:37.840]   Please Google Pegasus.
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:38.560]   Yeah.
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:41.400]   Uh, yeah.
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.560]   And the thing, the point I'm making, I guess with the, with a sharing your
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.960]   contact list, cause every app asks for it.
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:51.280]   And it is a convenience is that it's not merely that you're giving up your
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:51.960]   information.
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:56.080]   You're giving up everything you know about every one of your friends.
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:59.920]   So I'm giving people Alex Lindsey's private phone number.
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:02.360]   If I do that and the problem is, is that it's the,
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:03.920]   the pros and you probably know, yeah.
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:06.560]   And the problem is, it's probably a treasure trove.
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:06.960]   Right.
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:11.160]   I have a story about that someday, but I won't say it on the show.
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:17.360]   Anyway, so the, um, uh, the, the thing that also happens is, is when you're
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:21.280]   doing social engineering, having more people that are connected to each other,
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:26.080]   you can, you can sow things in, you know, to the process where it feels
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:29.520]   familiar, you know, that, oh, here's something and you can research a lot more.
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:33.520]   So that's the real problem is, especially when we've seen these, um, these exploits
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:37.400]   of the exchange servers that are people, when people weren't using the cloud,
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:41.280]   which is nuts, by the way, I mean, people think that I want to control my own email.
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:44.520]   That is a, you know, there's, you want to have a billion dollar company that
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:47.920]   pays that, that's the only job that they have is that, that's what you want.
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.520]   Um, not, not for you to do that.
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:52.640]   Anyway, so the exchange servers got leveraged and nothing, well, they said,
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:53.640]   wait, we don't know what happened.
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:57.440]   Well, what happened is now you have tons and tons of information that you can use
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.560]   to familiarize yourself.
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:02.960]   So if you want to send someone a personal attack, that fishing becomes way,
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:08.480]   way more powerful than sending you a randomly poorly poor English with a
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:12.440]   ugly length that isn't formatted well to something that looks exactly like it's
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:15.280]   coming from your bank or from Facebook or, or something.
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:19.040]   And it's set in a way, it's contextual to something that you may think is okay.
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:19.840]   And you click on it.
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:24.720]   And that's the stuff that you have to be, you know, super careful about, you know,
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:28.400]   and, and generally just links in general, it's just, it's just hard.
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:28.840]   It's hard.
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:33.160]   I mean, and, um, you know, that's why also with passwords, it should be just hashes.
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:36.280]   You can't, you can't make something up because if someone gets two or three of
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:39.360]   your passwords and you make them up yourself, you can start to see patterns.
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:41.880]   It's not that they'll know what pattern, they'll just know how you do your
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:42.440]   passwords.
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:45.280]   And that shortens their bliss by a lot.
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:50.200]   You know, so, you know, for me, I have a handful of very long strings that
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.760]   get me into my password manager.
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:56.920]   And then I have like 25 character hashes for everything, you know, and it just
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:57.560]   makes it simpler.
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:01.360]   Um, I got this.
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:05.640]   How is it cool?
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:11.920]   This being the little magical puck that goes right on the back of your, well,
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:15.600]   I said goes right on the back of your Mac safe puck.
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:21.240]   And this one is on a max 12 iPhone 12 pro max, which means it doesn't go to
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:22.120]   the edges on a mini.
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:23.200]   It will go all the way to the edges.
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.480]   This is the new Apple, um, MagSafe battery.
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.480]   Um, I'll shake it really hard.
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.200]   See what happens.
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.560]   I'm scared.
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.000]   This holds on pretty well.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:32.840]   Right.
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:36.200]   If you twist it, like, so I was shaking it like a headbanger and it was fine.
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:37.720]   George started shaking it sideways.
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:38.840]   It almost took off my head.
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:39.560]   Really?
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.520]   The other thing, twist, it'll come off.
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:42.520]   You know, it's 99 bucks.
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:46.040]   The other thing I like about it, unfortunately, it has a lightning connector,
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.040]   which I guess makes sense.
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:49.840]   You know, it would have been really cool as if Apple had kind of eased its way
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:54.200]   into type C by putting a type C connector on that because it's also a MagSafe
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:54.720]   charger.
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:59.120]   So if you plug it in and, uh, and use it, if you were going to get the puck,
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:03.000]   you could use it as a MagSafe charger that also is charging.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.480]   Unfortunately, not as much battery juices.
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:08.200]   The iPhone is, and it does have the nice graphics.
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.080]   It will charge your AirPods, but you can't charge it over.
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:13.280]   It's such a weird engineering thing.
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:16.000]   And I'm sure there's reasons for it, but it'll charge that you can,
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.440]   use your iPhone to charge the MagSafe battery, but you can't use a MagSafe
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:23.360]   power cable to charge the MagSafe battery.
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.520]   It's there's it's strange.
[00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:31.440]   I hate to say, I mean, but this is a kind of a classic Apple product,
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:35.320]   which is nicely designed.
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:41.160]   Not really anything anybody needs, I guess, and a little overpriced.
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:41.880]   It's a nice.
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:43.680]   If you have the mini, it's really nice.
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:46.200]   It turns the mini from a daily to an all daily, maybe.
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:46.800]   That's the problem.
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:48.360]   Cause the mini batteries crappy, right?
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:49.200]   Or not as much.
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:51.520]   So I never have problems with my phone.
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:54.520]   So it's yeah, with my max it, I don't have any problem with it.
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:55.880]   I never have a phone.
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:56.480]   Me too.
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:58.800]   But, uh, so I guess you don't really need it.
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:02.360]   But if you had a mini and if it's nice on the mini, yeah, and I don't know,
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:06.040]   it's not as ugly as the, as the snake, the data mouse case.
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:09.120]   The thing to remember about it is like it'll only charge 15 watts.
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.880]   If it's plugged in, it'll charge five watts.
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:11.800]   If it's not plugged in.
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:16.160]   So if I'm playing like Pokemon, go, I'm still, I'm still using battery faster than it can recharge it.
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:18.240]   But the whole idea is that it's not a charger.
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:19.200]   It's an extender.
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:23.560]   So if you, you have a mini and you are going out and you need extra battery, or if you, you have your max,
[00:23:23.560 --> 00:23:25.360]   Leo, but you're going camping for the weekend, right?
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:28.160]   And you just want it like, I'm going to keep three of them in my gear bag.
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:31.120]   So that if I'm at an event and I'm just running low, I can slap them on.
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.760]   They were like cannon batteries to me.
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:33.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:36.000]   I mean, I, and they're cheaper than camera batteries.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:36.640]   That's a good point.
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:37.160]   Yeah.
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:38.880]   And I'll just slap it on, take it off.
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:39.880]   So they're not heavy all the time.
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:41.520]   So that's actually a good use case.
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:45.960]   So you play Pokemon Go and I know you in the past, this has been an issue because you're out there all day.
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:48.960]   So, you know, it's grueling work hunting little Pokemon.
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:54.360]   So this is a good choice for a Pokemon Go player, you think?
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:56.560]   Yeah, I mean, it's not a case.
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:59.200]   Some people really want a case because just the way they hold it, they keep like
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:01.200]   unintentionally pulling it off, right?
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:03.240]   Or they're doing a lot of things that might result in the coming off.
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:04.360]   So there are some advantages.
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:07.760]   This is almost like the platakian ideal of what Apple's always wanted to do.
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:12.400]   Like the original MagSafe, the smart battery case, it's looked so goofy because Apple
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:16.280]   didn't want any material over the antennas because a lot of battery cases, you put them
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:18.080]   into charge, but they blocked the radio.
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:21.600]   So the radio amps up so it's consuming more power as you're charging them.
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:23.080]   And then it puts it into plug-in mode.
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:26.800]   So all the network coalescence acts up and it starts downloading things and sinking
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:28.240]   things and using even more power.
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:31.640]   So this is designed to use almost no power and to extend your battery.
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:33.760]   So if that's what you want, then get this.
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:34.480]   So that's not what you want.
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:35.160]   Just get a brick.
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.400]   Much cheaper, much more power.
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:36.840]   Yeah.
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:39.040]   And an anchor sells a similar device.
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:41.120]   It's also magnetic for about half as much.
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.560]   But I haven't tried it.
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:44.880]   I hear there are some downsides to that.
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:49.480]   It's a bit bulkier and it doesn't have the magic Apple integration, which I'm sure
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:50.840]   conscious is something that immediately.
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:54.760]   So I can't say whether to recommend it or not recommend it.
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:56.760]   You have to know what your use case is.
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:03.800]   Obviously, Renee needs three, but for most of us, you know, I bought it just because, well,
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:04.920]   you know, I should try it.
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:07.800]   I don't, it's not a terribly compelling product.
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:11.800]   I guess the biggest disappointment for me is it doesn't, it does not fully charge a
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:12.240]   max.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:14.520]   It only about half charges.
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:17.240]   I have, I have to admit that I have like lots of different size ones.
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:20.640]   I have big ones that I have in my bag, usually traveling and then I have
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:23.800]   little ones that I can throw my back pocket like, Oh, I'm running a little low.
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:24.640]   I'm going to lunch.
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:25.480]   I just want to make sure I don't.
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:26.000]   Right.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.680]   I can't, I can't run out of connection.
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:30.760]   It makes me miss the days and I really wish we bring them back over
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:31.880]   placeable batteries.
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:35.920]   Apple never did that, but, but, but Android phones have done that for years.
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:39.160]   We prior off the back, you could buy three batteries, perhaps the back, put it
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:41.440]   into one and it makes it easier to recycle.
[00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:43.200]   It adds life to the phone.
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:45.840]   But it also makes it harder to have a problem.
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:48.760]   You look at you, whether proof it, I have a problem or a solution.
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:49.200]   I'm not sure.
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.600]   Well, there are, I think you can still weather proof that there are, there.
[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:54.400]   I remember rubber grommets around it.
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:55.880]   I mean, there are ways to make it.
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.040]   Yeah.
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:25:57.480]   I do.
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:02.360]   I, I agree that I think I, I, I do miss some of the modularity, but the
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:06.440]   availability of external chargers, even like the little pencil type ones, I
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:09.560]   will just give you that one, one boost you need to get you over the cliff for
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:12.640]   the rest of the day has kind of almost made them obsolete.
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:13.480]   But you're right.
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:18.680]   I wish that there were that choice in, in, in, in Android space, but I guess
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:23.640]   that I have to get the, yeah, we carry, I, I, I have many, many of these
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:29.080]   anchor 10,000 milliamp hour battery packs, which are about, you know, they're
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:32.280]   similar to, you can show this, John, the similar to the thickness and sizes.
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:32.800]   Yeah.
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:33.400]   I have that one too.
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:33.560]   Yeah.
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:35.800]   We have four or five of them.
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.280]   And Lisa will just put it in her purse or whatever if she needs.
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:42.440]   And there's 21 bucks, you know, I mean, that's a, you know, particularly
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:46.640]   nowadays when all I used to have this one thing just to take me through like
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:47.880]   a day in New York or whatever.
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.400]   Now it's like, oh, they'll also top off my iPad.
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:50.960]   Oh, it'll also.
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:52.040]   Yeah, it does more book.
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:52.360]   Yeah.
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:54.280]   It's like, yeah, it does more.
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:55.520]   So it's my camera.
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:58.800]   That was, that was the, that was the big, that was the big score when finally,
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:02.240]   I don't necessarily have to bring extra batteries for my camera on a
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:05.440]   course of the day, because I can just charge it from a, from a brick, from a,
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:06.440]   from a battery pack.
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:10.840]   You could buy five of these Renee for the cost of one of the magnetic.
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:11.600]   Nice.
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:13.880]   What I find kind of, what I have that I have those.
[00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:14.840]   Yeah.
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:15.920]   It's not quite the same.
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:16.520]   Yeah.
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:20.120]   What I find kind of interesting about it is that this, it's rare that you, that
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:25.400]   Apple makes something under its own brand that is nice to have as opposed to
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:25.960]   essential.
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:29.560]   Like when they, when they come up with cases, you kind of have to have a case
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:31.840]   for your, for your phone headphones.
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:33.280]   You kind of have to have headphones.
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:38.200]   They, it's not since like the Apple sock, the iPod sock, that we get something
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:39.480]   that these are nice to have.
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:44.920]   It's an alternative to the regular USB C type charger, but it's not going to be
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:47.880]   right for most, I'm sorry, most is probably the wrong word.
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:52.440]   It's not going to be right for, for all people and there are better alternatives
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:52.880]   out there.
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:57.600]   It sounds like the sort of thing that they would typically encourage a hardware
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:00.920]   partner in the third party to make with their, with their own guns.
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:02.480]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:03.120]   Yeah.
[00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:04.360]   They have a big problem.
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:05.800]   I don't think it's a big problem, but they have a problem.
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:08.880]   They need to overcome because they're, they're inexorably moving towards
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:12.200]   portless iPhones, but wireless is just not efficient.
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.240]   Like it's not efficient for anything.
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:15.280]   It's not as good at travel, at transferring files.
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:16.560]   It's not as good at charging.
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:20.440]   It wastes a lot more energy than the power that you get, but it's so convenient
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.920]   that people like it and it's become a popular feature.
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:26.120]   And we see this even with like Android devices are putting like four batteries
[00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:29.640]   in parallel now and warp charging them in a way that will probably melt them
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:30.600]   in three and a half days.
[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:31.640]   But people love that.
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.560]   Like the, it's like the megapixel word, the faster you can charge a phone, the better.
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:37.720]   But it goes against a lot of what they're saying about their environmental
[00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:38.320]   concerns.
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:41.360]   And I think these are the sort of the aspirational products they want to make
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:45.280]   to show the value of the MagSafe ecosystem as they move us towards that
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:46.280]   portless iPhone.
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:49.880]   But I still, I still have massive reservations about the, just the, the,
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:52.640]   I don't know the wisdom of that sort of transition.
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:53.400]   Yeah.
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:53.640]   No.
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:58.800]   And I, I, I'm going to be, if I, I will be really shocked if Apple can do a
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:04.120]   portless iPhone in such a way that it isn't a real middle finger to the consumer.
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:08.200]   I can't, I can't imagine what they will, they're going to have to make the case
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:13.040]   of here is, here is why you want this to be a portless phone and you don't want
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:14.640]   to have a USB-C port on there.
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:18.480]   And you're going to have to talk to a bunch of skeptical people who are saying
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:25.000]   that, so you want me to never ever be able to use wire headphones, even with a dongle.
[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:30.080]   You're saying that you never ever are going to see me having a need to attach
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:32.600]   some sort of an external storage like a card reader.
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:37.640]   You're saying that all of these things that he's saying that will never ever be
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:43.880]   necessary for me to dock this to my desktop for, to get this out of lock, to get
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:45.080]   anything done with it.
[00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:48.960]   You're saying that I will never, ever, ever be cursing the day that you and
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:53.000]   everybody else who has ever worn an Apple badge was born.
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:58.960]   And I can't, I can't imagine the case that they can make to say that, that ends
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:29:59.800]   with your welcome.
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:01.200]   We finally deleted you.
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:02.600]   I think it's going to be a tie-off.
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:03.240]   The tyranny.
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.680]   I think they're going to cut that knot by making it the top of the, there'll be a
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:10.480]   special flagship iPhone again, like the iPhone 10 was, and it's not going to
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:10.960]   have a port.
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:16.320]   All of the pleep models, the low end, the muggle iPhones will have ports, but it
[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:18.880]   will be seen as like, Oh, oh, that one is so good.
[00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:20.280]   You don't need the next year.
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:21.520]   It'll be like, Oh, now everybody can.
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:23.720]   Finally, everybody cannot have a port.
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:24.040]   I know.
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:26.520]   That's what happened with the headphone jack.
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:29.960]   I do think that halfway, I think halfway in between though is some kind of
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:33.920]   connector like this that you have a, you know, a series of connectors on the back
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:35.840]   that just started contact that.
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:37.760]   That's what they're, I'm sure going to do, right?
[00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:40.120]   Have the, I don't think it's going to be like wireless wireless.
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:40.840]   I think it's going to be.
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:40.840]   Right.
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:42.200]   Very docs are awesome.
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:45.720]   I think that every feels device I own should have its own dog.
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:48.160]   I'm just saying that is completely incompatible to everything else.
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:49.520]   That is the best solution.
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:52.200]   That's the most Apple solution that I've ever come up with.
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:55.320]   Every vendor has their own proprietary wireless charger that only,
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:57.720]   that only gives you the speeds that they tell you are normal.
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:00.600]   If you have that charger, otherwise you get 15 Watts like a, like a plea again.
[00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:03.000]   Actually, we're just, that raises the question.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.520]   Is this a Qi charger?
[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:06.480]   This makes a battery pack.
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:06.920]   It is cheeky.
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:08.760]   So it would work with your Apple watch.
[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:11.320]   Oh, yeah, because that's not a Qi device.
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:14.760]   No, but if you had a Qi device, it would, but it would only charge a five Watts.
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:17.720]   You're saying it wouldn't be 15 Watts when plugged in, five Watts.
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:19.880]   Oh, so even on Qi, it'll do 15 Watts.
[00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:20.960]   Yeah.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.440]   If it's plugged in, that's good.
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:22.760]   Thanks.
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:26.760]   You just, you just for imagine me that I just, I was going to, I was going to install the,
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:30.800]   the update, the security update this morning on my iPad, but I didn't have enough battery.
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:35.600]   And I, so I brought this to my table to be charged by never actually plugged it in.
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:36.360]   Use a Qi charge.
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:39.600]   Oh, I should, I should have meant that Leo 12 Watts on an iPhone mini,
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:41.560]   because the mini small does take the heat as well.
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:41.960]   Got it.
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:43.720]   So 12 Watts on the mini 15 Watts, everything else.
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:49.240]   Hey, just parenthetically, those of us on the public beta of iOS 15,
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:52.000]   you know, my kids, iPad, iOS 15 aren't getting a bug fix.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.240]   Uh, is that because we don't need a bug fix?
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:32:00.680]   Or because it's usually rolled into the beta, it'll come into, but or may, or maybe it'll come
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:01.240]   with the next one.
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:01.640]   Well, I don't know.
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:03.520]   This was such urgent recent one.
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:04.360]   I don't know if it's in it.
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:08.800]   I don't think they've ever done a point beta, like a, I don't think they've ever done a point beta.
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:08.960]   Really.
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:12.320]   I figure they figure like if you're, if you're on the beta, is it not your primary device and that you?
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:16.760]   You've got another argument for not using the public beta, because you're not necessarily going to get
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:18.760]   on your main device on your, or, yeah.
[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:22.000]   But unless you're not going to ever use the public beta on your main.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.440]   Well, that's obvious.
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:23.720]   Yeah.
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:24.360]   That's crazy.
[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:24.880]   I say that.
[00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:26.240]   Well, I use a beta on my public.
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:28.560]   The 15 beta for your man's coming.
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:31.880]   It did come out today, but that's, I don't think that's, I think it's the developer beta, right?
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:34.840]   I mean, it's really beta until the next version comes out.
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:37.800]   Like it's like it's mature.
[00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:40.680]   Like I, I'm, I'm looking for the machine that I'm on right now.
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:44.560]   I'm looking forward to updating the big sir in October and then, yeah.
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:45.560]   Yeah.
[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:47.680]   And it was a big change in the.
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:49.320]   Sorry.
[00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:50.440]   Go ahead.
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:54.960]   I was going to say the most exciting thing for me was the Mac OS beta today brings live
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.000]   text to Intel Macs.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:56.520]   Yay.
[00:32:56.520 --> 00:33:00.160]   They didn't do before because they just ported the iOS version over and the iOS version
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:03.040]   leans completely on the neural engines, which the Mac doesn't have.
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:03.360]   Right.
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:08.000]   Because the T2 chip in there is an A10, which was before neural engines were invented,
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   basically for Apple.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.640]   And now what they're doing is because they don't, well, a lot of people demanded it.
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:15.240]   So they moved around the schedule to get people to actually make it.
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.840]   But because there's no cameras, they don't need to do it in real time.
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:21.120]   It's all done out like completely in real time on iOS.
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:24.160]   So now they're just going to do it opportunistically whenever they need the cycles
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:26.000]   for it on, on Intel Macs.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.960]   What is the typical time between the release of the developer beta and an update to the
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:31.680]   public beta?
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:33.160]   Two, three days.
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:33.640]   OK.
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:39.160]   So those of us on the public beta could expect perhaps an update the next few days.
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:39.520]   Yeah.
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:41.080]   Have you tried live text yet, Leo?
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:43.840]   Because I was using it like a couple of times this week, it really surprised me.
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:47.800]   Like a family member was trying to get a wire transfer and they needed an
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:51.000]   address and I had it in my wire transfer, but it was a photograph.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   But I just opened it up.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.680]   So they put it in.
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:34:00.000]   And what I saw that was amazing was people were looking at the Apple slides and just
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.320]   taking screenshots of all the Apple slides, cutting and pasting the code,
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:07.480]   telling the whole code example out and pasting it into their projects.
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:08.320]   That is.
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:10.040]   So is that only in Monterey?
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:12.640]   Can I do that on a iPad, OS 15?
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:13.800]   No, it's an iPad.
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:14.640]   Yeah, it's in everything now.
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:16.240]   That's one of the nice things that Apple's doing.
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:17.200]   I will try it.
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:18.080]   Yeah, I haven't tried it.
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:19.000]   I forgot to try that.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.080]   I forget what's so far.
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:23.480]   Like I'm in screenshots in my in my camera and I'm cutting and pasting text.
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:27.760]   And then I try to hit the link, the link's open, like your the links for like
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:31.840]   addresses for phones for delivery dates open and you forget you're not in a browser.
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:33.480]   Sometimes it's really nice.
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:39.560]   These these are the kind of features that every single major tech company needs to focus on.
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:43.080]   It's it's nice that they've moved that Apple's moved to Apple Silicon.
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:47.200]   There are other features that are subtle that are kind of nice.
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:54.480]   I feel as though we rarely get that kind of feature that, wow, you have solved a problem that I didn't even know was solvable.
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:35:01.000]   I thought it was part of Life's burden that that tech always appear in places where I have to retype it myself.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:11.360]   The fact that now I just simply if it exists on my screen, I can get it as not only get it as text, but also use it the way that the the way that this text has been formatted.
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:17.480]   That's the sort of feature that I think that is missing from a lot of the major OS updates on phones and on desktops.
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:27.560]   I will say that I think that some of that is it has to do with fragmentation because I know for us when we develop products that were cross platform, just surviving the other platforms.
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:33.280]   So, you know, like on a Mac, there was like a small number of things that I have to do, especially if you're the one controlling the OS and the hardware.
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:41.520]   When you're on a PC, there was 27 options when, you know, like there was all these different things and you spend so much time just surviving the experience.
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:49.800]   That you don't innovate in a way that you can because you have too many. There's too many variables and it is a big problem with development and it slows everything down.
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:56.440]   It is, but who two trillion dollar company working on being a two three-trill drunk and there are multiple companies that fit that description.
[00:35:56.440 --> 00:36:05.800]   And I'm not saying that, oh, got, you know, to hell with everybody that decides to just make internet speed better and make things more secure.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:18.440]   But I'm saying that that's the you need to have that you need to provoke that delight when you first update your operating system that says, oh, my God, when how long has this been happening and why am I so stupid as to not have been using it all along?
[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:35.960]   I think short shortcuts is a lot is a lot like that that the moment that I get the same sort of joy from shortcuts that I used to get off of Apple script and the same sort of flex when I show somebody when I do something that I've been doing, like on my phone or on my iPad for like a long, long time.
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:44.120]   And so wait, what did you just do? Oh, well, I have a shortcut that just takes it takes whatever URLs in front there and automatically puts it where I've, oh, how did you do that?
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:52.040]   Let me well put on putting on the straw boater and my monorail, my monorail Sam song.
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:52.680]   Yes.
[00:36:52.680 --> 00:37:01.160]   When you see apps that really have really committed to shortcuts, like Adam Toa was showing in Mix Effect Pro, he's the developer Mix Effect Pro.
[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:14.520]   He's got all these shortcuts that are all built into the whole thing and you just, you can do so much suddenly it just takes the app and turns it into an entirely different thing, which already turns like the Black Magic Switcher into a whole nother thing.
[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:22.440]   And so, but it's when the developer really understands the culture and understands the process and starts adding all the hooks in that you need.
[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:25.200]   Yeah, shortcuts just become just insanely powerful.
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:40.920]   I think shortcuts are in the developer community. It's one of the most infectious viral type of memes because all you have to do is to get one developer on their own relying on shortcuts for their own work.
[00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:48.720]   And suddenly they want every single tool that they build to support it because they're going to be using this outliner themselves. They're going to be using this time manager themselves.
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:59.400]   And they're not going to shortchange themselves in terms of features and it really is a replay of what we used to see with AppleScript themselves, where people, I want to be able to script this myself.
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:02.720]   Therefore, I'm going to incorporate scripting into this tool that I'm building.
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:03.480]   Yeah.
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:12.600]   It's, you know, for a long time, the idea of putting Lua or some sort of scripting language in a program in gaming has been around for an awful long time.
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:14.920]   It's a really nice feature.
[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:17.280]   It really puts more hand in the power of users.
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:17.720]   It's a really iOS games.
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:18.240]   Yeah.
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:19.200]   Yeah, it's really cool.
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:20.440]   They've been sneaking it in for years.
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:20.800]   Yeah.
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:28.000]   Well, it's nice to when you, when you can, you can build something that's really easy for someone and then just leaving them a window of, hey, you can customize it in Conduit.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.400]   When we had Conduit, we would have all the Conduit, all the stuff that you could build a notal composite.
[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:36.720]   You can do all the stuff and we had all these tools, but Paulie added, oh, you just put JavaScript in here.
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:48.280]   Like just, you know, just, there's, there's, you take the input and just write what you want it to do and have it come out so that you could, and he did it because again, he, he wanted to be able to go off the rails.
[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:51.640]   You know, and into the grass when he needed to, and then come back on.
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:59.280]   And then eventually he would turn that node, if he used it a lot into a, into an actual node, but he, he was able to experiment quickly and anybody could, he just made it available.
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:04.160]   To some degree, I feel like it's a mistake that Apple is historically made with Apple, Script and Shortcuts.
[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:10.200]   They're trying to make it easy for everybody to use, but as a result, it's not, they're not real programming languages.
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:14.520]   And actually, I think they're harder to use than if you just had a language in there.
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:25.840]   I guess I feel like, man, I think that's where they're trying to go with Swift, right? And so, but the, but I still feel like there's this, there's this gap between, we've talked about this before, there's a gap between shortcuts and Swift.
[00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:33.400]   And I really think that gap is notal is, you know, a nodal programming language, you know, that, that basically lets you just draw out.
[00:39:33.400 --> 00:39:40.960]   And if you look at how complicated that can get, if you open up something like Unreal Engine, like all that stuff is built with all these nodes and all the behaviors and everything else.
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:47.960]   And yeah, you need to add some custom code. And every time you talk to someone that does development, they go, well, you can't do everything you can do in Swift or Objective-C.
[00:39:47.960 --> 00:40:07.900]   You're like, maybe you don't need to. Maybe you just need to do more than what you can do with the
[00:40:07.900 --> 00:40:21.900]   other thing that makes a lot of this possible. But the main thing is that if you did a nodal coding, which could be compiled into a product and sold on the App Store, it means that lots of people are given away in the App Store.
[00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:27.900]   Just like, I just want to use it on my phone. I want to build something that does the thing, the thing, the thing. And I don't want to learn how to write code.
[00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:33.900]   And then what would happen is it creates its own marketplace because developers could just create nodes. Like, this is the node that does the thing.
[00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:43.900]   And you could just buy nodes for a buck here and two bucks there and incorporate them into your product. I just feel like it would be, that's the bridge.
[00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:47.900]   And then, yes, you get to a point where the nodes aren't enough and then you move to Swift or Swift UI.
[00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:56.900]   Or you could put, well, again, I think being able to put, because so when you develop an Xcode, you might still use an interface designer.
[00:40:56.900 --> 00:41:01.900]   It's not node, but you might still use an interface designer. But then you can put code in those widgets.
[00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:07.900]   So I don't think they're incompatible. I think that's the first step into that.
[00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:14.900]   What are they doing with Swift UI kit now in Swift Playgrounds? Is it just an interface that I can design?
[00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:20.900]   Or I got the feeling with the new one that they're going to have more coding capabilities. I haven't played with it.
[00:41:20.900 --> 00:41:23.900]   Swift Playgrounds, you can code. I mean, you can write code in it and watch it.
[00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:32.900]   Because they said you could actually be able to upload your Swift UI apps to the App Store. So it must have more capabilities.
[00:41:32.900 --> 00:41:37.900]   It just has a lot of capabilities. I mean, you see some posts for folks that say I'm no longer a Swift developer.
[00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:42.900]   Swift UI developer. So they're definitely making it easier for folks because I don't have hands on.
[00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:50.900]   But this was an announcement that they made, though, with iPad OS 15, iOS 15 and a lot of Ray.
[00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:53.900]   A step beyond what you could do last year.
[00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:56.900]   I think we're going to keep on seeing those steps.
[00:41:56.900 --> 00:42:00.900]   They have to make coding more accessible because there's more demand for coding.
[00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:04.900]   There's more demand for customization than there are people available to do it.
[00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:11.900]   You're going to continue to see both education, Apple coding in schools is a big deal for Apple.
[00:42:11.900 --> 00:42:19.900]   Grow with Google is a big deal for Google. Everyone's pushing down that path because they have a huge massive shortage
[00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:23.900]   of capacity. All of them are short thousands of people.
[00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:27.900]   Renee, have you played with it? I'm trying to understand what's new.
[00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:30.900]   I know they made this announcement. I apologize for not spending more time with it.
[00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:36.900]   What is new in the new Swift UI and Playgrounds that wasn't there last year?
[00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:39.900]   I think it's more robust with UI support.
[00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:44.900]   But the big deal is that you can deploy to the App Store directly now so you can finally make apps for iOS on iOS,
[00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:47.900]   which has been on everybody's frustration going on.
[00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:51.900]   How capable is it? Can you write Swift code? I guess you can.
[00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:53.900]   It just puts Swift code in it.
[00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:56.900]   It's nowhere nearly as capable as Xcode.
[00:42:56.900 --> 00:43:02.900]   You might find yourself at a dead end and say, "Okay, now I've got to move to Xcode."
[00:43:02.900 --> 00:43:09.900]   You're not going to build Xcode in Xcode, but you'll be able to build basic applications.
[00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:14.900]   The stuff that I think they want, I think the whole goal of it was so that people wouldn't have to learn.
[00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:16.900]   People wouldn't have to make their first app on a Mac anymore.
[00:43:16.900 --> 00:43:18.900]   They could make their first app. They could learn how to make apps.
[00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:20.900]   They could learn all of that on an iPad now.
[00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:23.900]   I've been spending some time trying to learn Flutter and Dart,
[00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:29.900]   which is also a cross-platform designer for this from Google.
[00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:32.900]   It's Android first, but it supports iOS.
[00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:36.900]   You can make it pretty native. They have native widgets for it.
[00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:41.900]   I'm curious which will be the better way to develop for the iOS platform.
[00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:47.900]   But shortcuts are really golden because there are people as soon as you tell them,
[00:43:47.900 --> 00:43:52.900]   "Hey, but there's a really good programming development language and environment that's available now on the iPad."
[00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:59.900]   They totally turn off. All they really want to do is, "Damn, why is it so hard for me to create a bookmark in Safari?"
[00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:03.900]   That will also be bookmark in Chrome or someplace else.
[00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:05.900]   You say, "Well, it will take you maybe 10 minutes."
[00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:09.900]   If you haven't done a shortcut before, it might take you 20 minutes to learn it,
[00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:14.900]   but then you'll learn skills that will make you late on all of your work
[00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:19.900]   because you'll be trying to -- it's the chainsaw principle where you buy a chainsaw
[00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:24.900]   because there was a downed limb in front of your lawn.
[00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:27.900]   It takes you maybe 10 minutes to cut apart that limb.
[00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:31.900]   Then you spend the whole rest of the day saying, "Playing the game called, what else will it cut?"
[00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:33.900]   And that shortcuts in a nutshell.
[00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:36.900]   In AppleScript, you could embed any arbitrary program code.
[00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:38.900]   I presume that's the same in checkups.
[00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:41.900]   You could get so far with shortcuts and say, "I need code."
[00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:45.900]   And then you could say, "Oh, good. I just write some code in checkups."
[00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:48.900]   Usually what you do is you'll find on the App Store someone has written an app
[00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:54.900]   that is there almost solely to support shortcuts so that if you want a graph
[00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:58.900]   that's to spit out based on health results or on financial results or whatever,
[00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:03.900]   there's a really great app you can buy that will just do nothing but take parameters
[00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:07.900]   and spit out a beautiful, beautiful graph of any kind that you want.
[00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:12.900]   I had this problem with AppleScript too, and I did quite a bit of AppleScript coding.
[00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:17.900]   And even before that with HyperCard's programming language is that
[00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:23.900]   they're not traditional programming languages, so they're very difficult for people who are programmers
[00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:27.900]   to wrap your head around because it's like, "Wait a minute. It's too English-like."
[00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:30.900]   And I feel like that's a disadvantage.
[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:35.900]   But I know with AppleScript you can absolutely write code in some other language
[00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:38.900]   and then call it. I presume you can do that in shortcuts.
[00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:41.900]   You can call something in shortcuts, right?
[00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:43.900]   I should probably check.
[00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:46.900]   I've never even tried that because it's never even occurred to me to do that.
[00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:47.900]   Yeah, I'm pretty sure you can.
[00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:50.900]   Because I feel as though shortcuts are in a certain box mentally
[00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:55.900]   and that by the time I want to run external code, that's a good time to start thinking about other tools.
[00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:56.900]   Maybe, yeah.
[00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:58.900]   Where's Matthew Casanelli when you need him?
[00:45:58.900 --> 00:45:59.900]   Yeah.
[00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:01.900]   Well, yeah. Let's see.
[00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:05.900]   I don't know. I think you can JavaScript in this.
[00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:06.900]   I bet you can.
[00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:07.900]   Yeah.
[00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:09.900]   I mean, it'd be crazy. You could an AppleScript.
[00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:11.900]   And I'm sure you could.
[00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:12.900]   You can't.
[00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:15.900]   OSAScript-E, Telap system events.
[00:46:15.900 --> 00:46:20.900]   Yeah, no, but I want to put in...
[00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:22.900]   You know, I want to put some Python code.
[00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:23.900]   That's what I want to know.
[00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:24.900]   That's what I want to know.
[00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:26.900]   Can I put some Python code in my shortcut?
[00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:28.900]   I'd be surprised if there weren't a helper app for Python.
[00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:29.900]   That's got to be what we do.
[00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:34.900]   I just pass it some variables and then have this container that has your Python script.
[00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:35.900]   Yeah.
[00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:36.900]   Yeah.
[00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:37.900]   Yeah.
[00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:39.900]   Certainly was with OSA script.
[00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:40.900]   Yeah.
[00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:41.900]   Apple, my God.
[00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:53.900]   It was so hard to abandon AppleScript because by the time I was having so much fun with it from my first days and my 20s to the days where I finally had to get rid of it because kind of like my last car was just...
[00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:57.900]   It was rusted out and I realized that I was just using AppleScript because I liked it so much.
[00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:07.900]   It was at the point where if you could call up any user interface element within AppleScript as well, you could use interface builder from Xcode to build whatever you wanted.
[00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:12.900]   I mean, the sophistication of the apps that I was building is one of the reasons why I didn't have it.
[00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:13.900]   I just...
[00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:16.900]   It was if you're doing anything in any other language, it's like...
[00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:18.900]   I can't go back and forth.
[00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:19.900]   I just can't.
[00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:20.900]   Oh, yeah.
[00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:22.900]   I'll say it had its problems.
[00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:41.900]   The worst debugging problem I ever... I think most frustrating one I've ever had to solve was there was an update to AppleScript during the time in which I had sent my manuscript for a long, long AppleScript example to, I think, Macworld.
[00:47:41.900 --> 00:47:54.900]   There was a... I had this really incredibly cool AppleScript that would automatically... it would basically take a look at the live stream from a video capture card that had closed captioning.
[00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:57.900]   So it would keep an eye on the closed captioning stream.
[00:47:57.900 --> 00:48:06.900]   And so whenever a keyword would pop up, it would start recording and save it to a file so that if you wanted to monitor CNN at any time that this topic comes up, please save that file.
[00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:09.900]   And it worked great, was perfect, was wonderful.
[00:48:09.900 --> 00:48:14.900]   And the time that was in editing, an AppleScript update came out and it stopped working.
[00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:31.900]   And it took a team of Jason Stell, myself, and someone else days and days and days to figure out that the one of the... as a result of this change, the fact that I refer to an object as like the window instead of window, that was causing it to die.
[00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:35.900]   And at that point, some of my love for AppleScript died as well a little bit.
[00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:37.900]   The tooling isn't great.
[00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:45.900]   Though I have found in shortcuts, there is a shortcut command that will probably solve all any issues I might have run script over SSH.
[00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:50.900]   So I get SSH to another computer and run a script.
[00:48:50.900 --> 00:48:52.900]   Hey, that's good enough for me.
[00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:55.900]   So I'm funny that way.
[00:48:55.900 --> 00:48:56.900]   You know, my head gets into space.
[00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:58.900]   I've been doing so much functional programming lately.
[00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:04.900]   And then when I sit down a Python and change the value of a variable, it makes me shake.
[00:49:04.900 --> 00:49:06.900]   Because no, you shouldn't be able to do that.
[00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:07.900]   That's insane.
[00:49:07.900 --> 00:49:09.900]   Whoever thought that was a good idea.
[00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:11.900]   I go, calm down, Leo. It's okay. It's okay.
[00:49:11.900 --> 00:49:12.900]   Let's take a little break.
[00:49:12.900 --> 00:49:18.900]   Andy Anaka, Renee, Richie, Alex, Lindsey, the A team is in the house.
[00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:26.900]   We're talking about everything Apple showed today brought to you by literally, quite literally, cash fly.
[00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:31.900]   Cash fly is our CDN, our content delivery network.
[00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:33.900]   It has been for more than 10 years.
[00:49:33.900 --> 00:49:37.900]   In fact, it was so hard in the early days of the podcast to get the podcast to people.
[00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:40.900]   I was going through all sorts of crazy.
[00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:45.900]   You know, at one point I was using BitTorrent and begging listeners, please, when you get the podcast,
[00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:48.900]   seed it so others can download it.
[00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:49.900]   Matt Levine called me from cash fly.
[00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:52.900]   I said, Leo, Leo, please, we can solve this.
[00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:56.900]   And we've been a happy cash fly customer ever since.
[00:49:56.900 --> 00:50:02.900]   Now, cash fly, they've been doing this since 1999, has added something that I think is very
[00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:04.900]   cool for you streamers.
[00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:06.900]   Ultra low latency streaming.
[00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:09.900]   We're not talking the web, but RTC thing we were talking about earlier.
[00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:16.900]   No, this is really low latency delays as little as, well, as low as under a second.
[00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:20.900]   But you also get all sorts of other beneficial things.
[00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:26.900]   You see that great HTML5 player they have, which means with that SDK, you can do support
[00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:29.900]   everywhere, websites, applications, even mobile devices.
[00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:36.900]   Global delivery, because cash fly is the fastest CDN for throughput globally with over 50
[00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:39.900]   points of presence all over the world.
[00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:42.900]   On their low latency network, your video streams will be streaming quickly.
[00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:46.900]   Anywhere you have viewers, doesn't matter what continent they're on, they get it right from a server near them.
[00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:53.900]   And it can really scale up to a million, actually more than, not up to, more than a million concurrent
[00:50:53.900 --> 00:51:02.900]   users, as well as ingesting thousands of synchronous streams, and they can ingest RTMP, RTMP S, SRT,
[00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:07.900]   and more deliver ultra low latency SLDP and HLS streams at the same time.
[00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:10.900]   You'll get a solution just right for whatever you need.
[00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:12.900]   That's one of the things cash fly really offers.
[00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:16.900]   Great customer support, 24/7, 365 days a year.
[00:51:16.900 --> 00:51:21.900]   And they can help you design this so that it works perfectly.
[00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:29.900]   More than a million concurrent streams, up to five times faster than other CDNs, backed by a 100% SLA.
[00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:36.900]   I mean, honestly, cash fly is the one they pioneered, the first AnyCAS CDN infrastructure in 2002.
[00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:43.900]   Their best top technology automatically finds the fastest route to and from customer origin across that big global network of POPS.
[00:51:43.900 --> 00:51:46.900]   We're very happy to be coming to you on cash fly.
[00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:49.900]   It's one of the reasons it's so easy to download our shows.
[00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:55.900]   Cash fly is giving away a complimentary detailed analysis of your current CDN bill and usage trends.
[00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:58.900]   See if they can save you 20% or more.
[00:51:58.900 --> 00:52:02.900]   Just go to twit.cash fly.com.
[00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:07.900]   No pressure, no sales, just information to help you make the race choice.
[00:52:07.900 --> 00:52:10.900]   Twit.cash fly.com.
[00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:12.900]   We're big fans.
[00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:14.900]   Thank you, cash fly.
[00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:20.900]   Big Samsung event coming up August 11th, two weeks from tomorrow.
[00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:26.900]   We'll be covering it, of course, live to making Jason Sele get up at 7 a.m. Pacific Times.
[00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:28.900]   Jason Howell, not Snell.
[00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:30.900]   Snell would be wrong.
[00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:31.900]   Yeah.
[00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:36.900]   But this is going to be their Galaxy Fold 3, we think, and their new Galaxy Flip.
[00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:41.900]   When is Apple or is Apple ever going to do a foldable phone?
[00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:42.900]   I don't know.
[00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:48.900]   The pressure is definitely going to be coming up there because Samsung has gotten so good
[00:52:48.900 --> 00:52:53.900]   at developing these panels that a lot more manufacturers are getting on board.
[00:52:53.900 --> 00:53:00.900]   The third generation of Samsung's foldables are probably going to be the first generation
[00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:05.900]   where if you got the scratch, it will actually be a practical and functional and useful phone.
[00:53:05.900 --> 00:53:09.900]   Whereas the first one was clearly for the press.
[00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:12.900]   The third generation was for early believers.
[00:53:12.900 --> 00:53:16.900]   I think this third generation is going to be the first one where if you have been enamored
[00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:22.900]   of this sort of thing and you've got $1,500 to spend at least, it will be an actual functional,
[00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:23.900]   useful phone.
[00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:29.900]   There's a stronger rumor that Google is coming out with a foldable phone is also gaining
[00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:30.900]   speed and traction.
[00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:34.900]   Don't know if it's going to be this year, but there's going to be a time where they might
[00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:39.900]   find themselves in a Samsung Galaxy Note situation where someone is foolish enough to actually
[00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:40.900]   put these out there.
[00:53:40.900 --> 00:53:45.900]   They're smart enough to figure out how to make them work and then suddenly everybody wants
[00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:46.900]   them.
[00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:49.900]   That's I think when Apple will very, very seriously want to come up with a foldable, they're not
[00:53:49.900 --> 00:53:54.900]   going to come up with a foldable just to flex their technology.
[00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:57.900]   They have enough great stuff as it is.
[00:53:57.900 --> 00:54:03.900]   But man, if a folding iPad mini that would get my attention quickly, if I get a little
[00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:08.140]   quick, if I can't think of anything else that would almost immediately get me to switch my
[00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:11.900]   phone from an Android phone to iOS as a folding iPad mini.
[00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:16.900]   Do you think Apple might look at what Microsoft has done with the Surface Duo instead of a
[00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:17.900]   folding thing?
[00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:19.900]   Oh, you're into the screens with a hinge?
[00:54:19.900 --> 00:54:24.900]   Yeah, those are the current prototypes were like the previous prototypes were all hingeable.
[00:54:24.900 --> 00:54:27.900]   So going back to the iPhone 4, that's just because that was a limited technology.
[00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:28.900]   Yeah, that's all you could do.
[00:54:28.900 --> 00:54:32.900]   And they just didn't believe that the current panels are mature enough.
[00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:34.900]   But it's going to be similar to the big phones.
[00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:37.900]   Like there were Galaxy notes for years, like famously for years.
[00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:38.900]   Yeah, it took them a while.
[00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:39.900]   Yeah.
[00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:40.900]   Yeah.
[00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:43.100]   Because they don't really care about like sometimes they're first, but they don't really care
[00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:44.100]   about first.
[00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:46.820]   And now it's hard to imagine Apple not having a big phone, honestly.
[00:54:46.820 --> 00:54:48.300]   And I think it'll be the same thing.
[00:54:48.300 --> 00:54:50.900]   People like people like us will do them say saying they're late, they're late to the
[00:54:50.900 --> 00:54:51.900]   market.
[00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:54.500]   They don't have any and Apple's going to look at the size of the market and say that we
[00:54:54.500 --> 00:54:57.620]   don't have any presence in premium foldables, but it's not a big market yet.
[00:54:57.620 --> 00:55:02.540]   And then as it approaches the move from early adoption to mainstream acceptance, Apple
[00:55:02.540 --> 00:55:05.780]   will come out with a foldable and then three years from now, like it will just all think
[00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:07.180]   that those are normal phones again.
[00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:12.460]   Are you all excited about the new iPad mini rumors, the iPad mini six?
[00:55:12.460 --> 00:55:13.460]   Does it fold?
[00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:14.460]   It doesn't fold.
[00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:16.460]   It doesn't need to fold because-
[00:55:16.460 --> 00:55:18.620]   Well, it'll only fold it once.
[00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:22.220]   I was going to say, I was going to say everything.
[00:55:22.220 --> 00:55:23.220]   Everything will fold.
[00:55:23.220 --> 00:55:26.580]   It just will unfold and continue to work as the question.
[00:55:26.580 --> 00:55:27.580]   I love it because-
[00:55:27.580 --> 00:55:28.580]   And you and I want to foldable.
[00:55:28.580 --> 00:55:33.380]   Using the bezels and getting rid of the home button, they can get the same form factor.
[00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:37.260]   They can get a little more screen in there, which is nice.
[00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:39.420]   It's a mini air basically.
[00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:45.380]   It's super exciting because the smaller- There's a sweet spot for the size of an iPad that
[00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:51.980]   you've- It's got to be- Once you make it larger than a phone can reasonably be, but still so
[00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:57.660]   portable that you could stick it in your back pocket, that becomes a thing of wonder, I
[00:55:57.660 --> 00:56:05.140]   think, because iOS conflicts on its App Store quality, on its content quality, all that
[00:56:05.140 --> 00:56:07.420]   sort of stuff like no other device can.
[00:56:07.420 --> 00:56:12.580]   There are a lot of pocketable tablets out there that run Android, but none of them are,
[00:56:12.580 --> 00:56:13.820]   I think, are compelling.
[00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:17.980]   They're usually just sort of like the OS that runs underneath any book reader.
[00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:22.620]   You can buy a- I think Barnes & Noble still sells a nook that's made by Samsung.
[00:56:22.620 --> 00:56:25.420]   That is kind of like that sort of thing.
[00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:31.560]   But it's still apps that are basically phone apps that are run on a big screen, not iPad
[00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:32.560]   apps.
[00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:39.140]   So that puts me in a pickle because I already spent my iPad money this year.
[00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:40.620]   Yeah, so did I.
[00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:45.220]   I spent my iPad money for the last four years.
[00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:50.540]   And I did cheap out on buying a replacement phone last year.
[00:56:50.540 --> 00:56:53.820]   I bought the really, really super cheap Google Pixel.
[00:56:53.820 --> 00:56:57.860]   And it looks like the Pixel 6 might be the one that I was waiting for.
[00:56:57.860 --> 00:57:03.180]   And I can't, I absolutely cannot justify buying two iPads in the same year, the same
[00:57:03.180 --> 00:57:05.180]   year I might be spending $1,000 on a phone.
[00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:10.700]   But oh my God, if anything could make me want to eat ramen noodles and dry toast for two
[00:57:10.700 --> 00:57:14.180]   whole months to afford this, that could be it.
[00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:15.740]   Yeah.
[00:57:15.740 --> 00:57:20.460]   There was unclear at first whether to have a home button, the latest rumors are it will
[00:57:20.460 --> 00:57:25.980]   either have a Face ID or a fingerprint ID on the on it off switch.
[00:57:25.980 --> 00:57:28.980]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:57:28.980 --> 00:57:32.340]   I think you do want to maximize screen real estate if you're going to make a device that
[00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:34.180]   will fit in your pocket.
[00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:41.020]   Also also for this device, you really the the mental, the mental interface of having
[00:57:41.020 --> 00:57:43.940]   a screen that is just a screen without anything else on it.
[00:57:43.940 --> 00:57:47.540]   That is such a valuable thing when you're dealing with something that is about the size
[00:57:47.540 --> 00:57:51.420]   of a paperback book, something that you would hold in your hand all the time.
[00:57:51.420 --> 00:57:53.820]   I don't think the bezels are a huge distraction.
[00:57:53.820 --> 00:57:57.620]   I think that I think that there's way too much to be made of, oh my God, that bezel
[00:57:57.620 --> 00:57:59.100]   it must be five millimeters.
[00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:01.660]   The these direns must be ashamed of themselves.
[00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:05.620]   But this is a device that so long as I could still hold it without hold it accidentally without
[00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:07.780]   accidentally like doing button presses.
[00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:08.780]   That'd be great.
[00:58:08.780 --> 00:58:09.780]   Yeah.
[00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:10.620]   I might, yeah, I'm excited.
[00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:15.500]   I think I could actually see adding this to my iPad stable.
[00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:18.460]   I'm using the new iPad Pro a lot more than I thought.
[00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:19.460]   iPad Junior.
[00:58:19.460 --> 00:58:20.460]   Yeah, the Junior.
[00:58:20.460 --> 00:58:22.140]   I really like the iPad Pro.
[00:58:22.140 --> 00:58:26.580]   Will there be mini LED displays on other iPads going forward?
[00:58:26.580 --> 00:58:28.180]   Will this mini for instance?
[00:58:28.180 --> 00:58:29.180]   Not yet.
[00:58:29.180 --> 00:58:30.180]   They're still not there yet.
[00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:31.180]   No, well, it's a bomb.
[00:58:31.180 --> 00:58:32.180]   It's a bill of materials.
[00:58:32.180 --> 00:58:33.660]   They want it to fit a certain price point.
[00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:38.100]   Mini LED is expensive and it'll be a mini if you did that, it'd be a mini pro and it's
[00:58:38.100 --> 00:58:40.100]   not positioned to be a mini pro.
[00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:41.100]   Got it.
[00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:42.460]   And probably we're talking October, right?
[00:58:42.460 --> 00:58:47.460]   I mean, I'm just guessing September iPhone 13, October iPads.
[00:58:47.460 --> 00:58:52.940]   Additionally, September is iPhones and Apple watches and the lowest end iPad, at least
[00:58:52.940 --> 00:58:53.940]   for the last two years.
[00:58:53.940 --> 00:58:54.940]   Oh, okay.
[00:58:54.940 --> 00:58:55.940]   Oh, okay.
[00:58:55.940 --> 00:58:57.900]   And then October is max and the higher end iPads.
[00:58:57.900 --> 00:58:58.900]   So they might show up in the knee.
[00:58:58.900 --> 00:59:01.060]   We've seen that all change over the last year or so.
[00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:02.060]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:03.620]   But they could conceivably show that mini in September.
[00:59:03.620 --> 00:59:04.620]   Yeah.
[00:59:04.620 --> 00:59:05.620]   Reason I'm interested.
[00:59:05.620 --> 00:59:08.940]   It's not that far off, you know, for a while, the fall, sound like a long way off.
[00:59:08.940 --> 00:59:12.380]   We're almost in 2021.
[00:59:12.380 --> 00:59:13.380]   It's going fast.
[00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:14.380]   It was just as a tutus.
[00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:18.580]   Well, we were used to the sluggish pace of 2020 and now 2020 junior.
[00:59:18.580 --> 00:59:22.020]   Yeah, it would be really fast.
[00:59:22.020 --> 00:59:23.100]   So yeah, that's exciting.
[00:59:23.100 --> 00:59:26.820]   Actually speaking of iPhone, I guess they're if they're going to announce a new iPhone in
[00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:29.580]   September, they're probably starting to make them now.
[00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:30.580]   Would that make sense?
[00:59:30.580 --> 00:59:31.580]   Yeah.
[00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:33.180]   You're starting to see supply chain.
[00:59:33.180 --> 00:59:36.140]   August would be the August is usually the ramp up month.
[00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:37.140]   Yeah.
[00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:40.740]   So among other YouTuber published their dummy model hands on this week.
[00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:42.700]   So that's one of the signs that you follow lips.
[00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:45.820]   The dummy model hands on how accurate do you think those are?
[00:59:45.820 --> 00:59:48.900]   That's usually pretty accurate because they're what a lot of manufacturers use to base their
[00:59:48.900 --> 00:59:49.900]   cases off of.
[00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:51.900]   And that's so much money if they get it wrong.
[00:59:51.900 --> 00:59:52.900]   Yeah.
[00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:53.900]   Where do they get those from?
[00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:58.100]   Is there one person who's blessed as the person who is going to be making the most accurate
[00:59:58.100 --> 01:00:01.700]   one and then they sell them out or is it usually just here some files go to?
[01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:03.540]   I mean, between us friends, they bribe.
[01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:04.540]   It's such a big business.
[01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:06.140]   They bribe people on the supply chain to get them.
[01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:11.020]   If you're working at Foxconn for a bucket day, somebody offers you a thousand dollars.
[01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:14.020]   You might want to slip it into your pocket.
[01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:21.500]   These are the dummies that according to this Chinese social media site, Weibo, we're seeing.
[01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:24.060]   I don't know what that tells you.
[01:00:24.060 --> 01:00:27.060]   Marques has some very pretty robot footage of it up as well.
[01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:28.060]   Oh, really?
[01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:29.060]   Robots, of course he does.
[01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:30.060]   Wow.
[01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:32.060]   Well, he's the robot to move around it and get different angles.
[01:00:32.060 --> 01:00:33.060]   Oh, OK.
[01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:34.060]   Right.
[01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:35.060]   Motorized precision.
[01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:36.060]   What does he use?
[01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:37.060]   The Xbox controller.
[01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:38.060]   It's a motorized.
[01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:43.580]   I believe he has a motorized precision arm.
[01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:44.580]   I don't know which one he has.
[01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:48.900]   They think they start at 75,000 and they go up to about a quarter million dollars apiece.
[01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:49.900]   And they fully programmable.
[01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:51.460]   He has eight monstrous, though.
[01:00:51.460 --> 01:00:55.140]   So I mean, what's mostly just because you don't want to hand hold it as you shoot it?
[01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:56.220]   No, you can just do.
[01:00:56.220 --> 01:01:00.220]   You can do really precision moves because it's an arm that you can program and it's
[01:01:00.220 --> 01:01:03.700]   just will, you know, you say, I want to do this camera move and then look at it a couple
[01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:05.980]   of times and then do it exactly the way you want to do it.
[01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:09.740]   And when you do product shots for commercials, I mean, you know, when you're not doing
[01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:10.740]   a CD.
[01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:11.740]   He has a dope tech.
[01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:12.740]   Yeah, that's the--
[01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:14.700]   He has a dope tech to do up on the arm as well if you want to see the exact one he's
[01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:15.700]   used.
[01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:19.980]   Yeah, but that's the-- so it lets you do exactly the move that you want.
[01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:21.900]   And it will-- it has tracks as well.
[01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:24.820]   So you can have it travel and turn and move.
[01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:27.780]   And these are used a lot for things like you're dropping something.
[01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:31.380]   The ceiling, are you doing super slow-mo and you want to adjust the right product?
[01:01:31.380 --> 01:01:35.620]   Or effect shots because it will do the same shot over and over again so you can do passes.
[01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:36.620]   Yeah.
[01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:38.260]   You know, but you know, there's some kind of crazy--
[01:01:38.260 --> 01:01:41.380]   Kind of crazy for a YouTuber to have one, but hey.
[01:01:41.380 --> 01:01:47.380]   Well when you got-- when your Mark has Brownlee, you can-- you can spring for it.
[01:01:47.380 --> 01:01:48.380]   You know, it's--
[01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:49.380]   I'm going to guess.
[01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:51.860]   I'm going to bet you anything that he didn't spring for it.
[01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:52.860]   No, they gave it.
[01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:53.860]   They gave it to him.
[01:01:53.860 --> 01:01:54.860]   I think they gave it to him.
[01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:55.860]   Do you have seen Steve Gerald's stuff?
[01:01:55.860 --> 01:01:57.340]   They've got us talking about it.
[01:01:57.340 --> 01:01:58.820]   That's all they want, right?
[01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:00.220]   Who's Steve Gerald?
[01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:01.220]   What are you doing?
[01:02:01.220 --> 01:02:04.780]   All those commercials where you have like the really slow motion motion capture of like
[01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:05.780]   oranges smashing you?
[01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:06.780]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:07.780]   I've seen a TikTok.
[01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:08.780]   You've been falling into the glass.
[01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:09.780]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:10.780]   He does a lot of TikToks on Instagrams.
[01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:12.260]   Yeah, I love those.
[01:02:12.260 --> 01:02:13.260]   Actually that's the TikToks.
[01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:17.020]   I had to delete TikTok because I spent too much time on it.
[01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:21.060]   That was the TikToks I used to watch is all the filmmaking, the movie making.
[01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:22.060]   TikToks are cool.
[01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:24.780]   I think my favorite one recently was Smarter Every Day.
[01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:31.140]   I did one on a fuel air fuel mix in slow motion and they just showed how the clock
[01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:36.380]   carburetor worked and it was just like watching all the stuff in slow motion at 240 frames
[01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:38.260]   or more than that, it's like a thousand frames a second or something.
[01:02:38.260 --> 01:02:39.260]   There's no excuses.
[01:02:39.260 --> 01:02:40.020]   It's mesmerizing.
[01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:44.300]   If you're a kid, there's no excuse not to know everything now.
[01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:45.300]   Yes.
[01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:46.540]   I mean, why not?
[01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:49.300]   Why not just know everything there is to know?
[01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:52.260]   There's no excuse for ignorance anymore.
[01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:55.020]   My daughter learns new songs all the time and you're like, "Where did you learn them?"
[01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:56.020]   You know, YouTube.
[01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:59.420]   She just downloads them and just and they just go through it and just plays.
[01:02:59.420 --> 01:03:01.420]   She just learns to do something on the bass or on the keyboard.
[01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:05.100]   If you're begrudging the amount of time your children are spending watching YouTube videos.
[01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:06.100]   Yes, exactly.
[01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:07.100]   Maybe you shouldn't.
[01:03:07.100 --> 01:03:13.980]   We're at the point now where whenever there's a skill or there's a solution I need to make,
[01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:18.820]   like again, something is broken and I need to be able to, "Oh God, how do I fix it?
[01:03:18.820 --> 01:03:21.100]   How do I replace this compressor on my fridge?"
[01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:25.420]   I don't even just say maybe there'll be a YouTube video about it.
[01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:26.420]   I expect it.
[01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:27.660]   There better damn well be.
[01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:28.660]   I feel entitled.
[01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:29.660]   I can choose between.
[01:03:29.660 --> 01:03:30.660]   I can't even choose between.
[01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:31.660]   I can't even choose between.
[01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:32.660]   I can't choose between.
[01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:33.660]   If you're not, you tubers.
[01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:34.660]   You're exactly right.
[01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:38.100]   He shot this at 28,546 frames per second.
[01:03:38.100 --> 01:03:40.260]   When you watch it, it's just unbelievable.
[01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:41.260]   It's like mesmerizing.
[01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:43.380]   Now you know how a carburetor works.
[01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:45.420]   Yes, there's just no...
[01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:49.500]   I mean, I remember the teacher drawing this up on the chalkboard.
[01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:51.660]   There's no excuse for not knowing everything now.
[01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:52.660]   Geez, Louise.
[01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:54.540]   Good board.
[01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:56.580]   The problem is there's too much.
[01:03:56.580 --> 01:03:58.380]   There's too much stuff.
[01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:00.140]   A total of human knowledge.
[01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:02.420]   Yeah, it's all out there.
[01:04:02.420 --> 01:04:07.940]   And you know, in a way, by the way, this came out June 30, less than a month ago, 5.4
[01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:10.460]   million views.
[01:04:10.460 --> 01:04:12.100]   Somebody's watching.
[01:04:12.100 --> 01:04:17.700]   I think in a way this is the good news is thanks to YouTube, there is support, financial
[01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:22.780]   support for this kind of crazy stuff.
[01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:26.780]   Or Mark has Brownlee having a motorized arm.
[01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:28.780]   Time and time again.
[01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:33.540]   But when I'm watching some of my favorite stuff on television, sometimes I take that
[01:04:33.540 --> 01:04:41.740]   moment to sit back and think, Amazon is budgeting half a billion dollars to do a version of
[01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:44.340]   The Lord of the Rings as a streaming show.
[01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:51.460]   And they're trying to compete with Fran Blanche showing me how a 1962 display technology
[01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:52.460]   worked.
[01:04:52.460 --> 01:04:54.060]   And they're probably not going to do as good a job.
[01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:57.500]   Like, I'm like, oh my God, there's a new Fran Lab video.
[01:04:57.500 --> 01:04:58.500]   I'm going to cancel.
[01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:01.660]   I'm not going to do what I'm canceling my plans because I can't wait to see it.
[01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:02.660]   I can't do it.
[01:05:02.660 --> 01:05:04.260]   And I've got videos.
[01:05:04.260 --> 01:05:07.980]   And the thing is, is that what's really exciting about it is like I've had the opportunity
[01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:09.620]   to work with Dustin.
[01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:17.060]   And just like Renee, like Justin Nasric, like Dustin, you have people who are passionate.
[01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:18.860]   They're passionate about this thing.
[01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:19.900]   They love doing it.
[01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:20.900]   Yeah.
[01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:22.060]   And it wouldn't work in TV.
[01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:25.060]   You know, like, you, you, because the market would have to be so broad.
[01:05:25.060 --> 01:05:27.100]   So when you look at Smarter Every Day, he puts up all this.
[01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:30.220]   I, is one of my favorite YouTube channels.
[01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:33.500]   Second only to Renee's channel channel.
[01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:39.540]   And, and, but, but one of my, one of my favorite channels just because it's just, he's just
[01:05:39.540 --> 01:05:42.780]   an unabashed geek about all kinds of different things.
[01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:45.940]   Like, you should never know what's going to, like, this was just one of many weird things
[01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:48.340]   that he shows that you just can't stop watching.
[01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:52.500]   You know, and, and I think that it's, it's, it's, it's, it's a really great.
[01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:54.420]   I mean, there's, there's a bunch of sites like this.
[01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:55.420]   Yeah.
[01:05:55.420 --> 01:05:59.580]   I'll, I'll say this to anybody who's considering starting a YouTube channel, starting a TikTok,
[01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:03.540]   starting anything, the most valuable thing it has nothing to do with the cameras, has
[01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:06.300]   nothing to do with having a good focus.
[01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:08.220]   It really is all about your point of view.
[01:06:08.220 --> 01:06:12.540]   You have a unique perspective on the world on what fascinates you and what you think
[01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:14.500]   is interesting enough to share.
[01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:18.540]   And time and time again, the, the number of channels that I subscribe to that are on topics
[01:06:18.540 --> 01:06:25.340]   that I don't have any practical interest in, but I'm really interested in how this creator
[01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:33.220]   shares their, their, his or her understanding of the universe through how they build cosplay,
[01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:37.380]   through how they take apart old electronics and put them back together again.
[01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:38.660]   This is what gets me going.
[01:06:38.660 --> 01:06:39.660]   Yeah.
[01:06:39.660 --> 01:06:40.660]   Yeah.
[01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:41.660]   Me too.
[01:06:41.660 --> 01:06:42.660]   Music theory.
[01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:43.660]   I know nothing about music.
[01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:47.260]   It's, it's because it's so fascinating to hear them talk about it so passionately.
[01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:48.260]   Yeah.
[01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:52.540]   In a way, it's depressing to me because I just, it's not enough time left.
[01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:53.540]   Yeah.
[01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:58.380]   I don't think if you, if you're born today, there would not be enough time left to, to
[01:06:58.380 --> 01:07:01.740]   do everything and learn everything you want to learn and have the choice of algorithms.
[01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:03.740]   We'll tell you the algorithms will tell you what to learn.
[01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:04.740]   Yeah.
[01:07:04.740 --> 01:07:05.740]   It's fine.
[01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:08.220]   Well, the funny thing is you can scan through so many things that what it used to take while
[01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:11.380]   there's so much to learn, you can learn it so much faster.
[01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:12.380]   Much better.
[01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:14.460]   I have this thing about trying to get to single ingredients.
[01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:18.020]   I look at anything that my family's getting and I go, well, how do I make that of single
[01:07:18.020 --> 01:07:21.020]   ingredients so that we don't have to buy it in a box?
[01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:24.900]   And so I looked at this big section of spaghetti and decided I was going to learn how to make
[01:07:24.900 --> 01:07:29.900]   pasta and, you know, ordered some pasta, you know, a little thing to flatten the pasta
[01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:32.620]   out in 20 minutes.
[01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:35.700]   It's not hard to become a pasta expert, I confess.
[01:07:35.700 --> 01:07:39.700]   It isn't, but, but the point is, is I realized it was a mystery to me until about, it wasn't
[01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:40.700]   half a go.
[01:07:40.700 --> 01:07:41.700]   Yeah.
[01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:44.500]   And I watch the video, but not only that, you watch some videos that are kind of hacking
[01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:49.700]   through it and then there's this Ukrainian Russian that she's like, this is the way to
[01:07:49.700 --> 01:07:50.700]   do it.
[01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:51.700]   Like, like, this is the measurement.
[01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:54.380]   You know, they're going to tell you a bunch of things, but this is the measurement.
[01:07:54.380 --> 01:07:56.980]   If you just do this thing, it'll turn out every single time.
[01:07:56.980 --> 01:07:59.500]   You know, and, and I just love the fact that you do it.
[01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:01.460]   It suits a certain type of personality.
[01:08:01.460 --> 01:08:04.300]   And Alex, you're that type of personality.
[01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:10.140]   You're an enthusiast and your enthusiasm's move rapidly from thing to thing.
[01:08:10.140 --> 01:08:14.300]   So it's perfect for you because you get an enthusiasm, you want to know how to make perfect
[01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:15.980]   popcorn and you can do it.
[01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:16.980]   Right.
[01:08:16.980 --> 01:08:18.140]   You know, there's a way to do it and you're done.
[01:08:18.140 --> 01:08:19.420]   And now you move to the next thing.
[01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:22.780]   Well, not something that we like that, but, but if you're like that, you're in a, this
[01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:24.140]   is a, you're in a hog heaven.
[01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:28.140]   Well, and that's the thing like, like with office hours, I mean, all what we realized
[01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:31.180]   was that the only thing that we're, that makes us all the same because everyone's different,
[01:08:31.180 --> 01:08:32.940]   they're all over the world is that we're curious.
[01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:34.380]   Like we're curious and we want to figure something out.
[01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:36.660]   And so you just have a bunch of people that are like talking about it.
[01:08:36.660 --> 01:08:38.900]   We cook, we're cooking on Saturdays again soon.
[01:08:38.900 --> 01:08:40.660]   And people like to do that too.
[01:08:40.660 --> 01:08:45.540]   Yeah, but you, so there's a curious person who spends an entire lifetime mastering a
[01:08:45.540 --> 01:08:47.820]   single skill.
[01:08:47.820 --> 01:08:50.980]   That's one kind of curiosity.
[01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:51.980]   And we need those people.
[01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:55.580]   I've been thinking actually a lot about that because I'm like you.
[01:08:55.580 --> 01:08:58.780]   I'm the broad, but shallow guy.
[01:08:58.780 --> 01:09:00.060]   And I couldn't do it.
[01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:04.100]   But the people who are real expertise are the it's like promen's of the world who spent
[01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:11.340]   100,000 hours just banging on that violin, just keep just, you know, arpeggios and scales.
[01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:14.300]   Yeah, your yo, yo, ma or whoever the ma.
[01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:15.300]   Yeah.
[01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:20.780]   And or, you know, the rock climber there's boy, the New York Times had an amazing online
[01:09:20.780 --> 01:09:22.340]   piece about rock.
[01:09:22.340 --> 01:09:23.660]   That was Spiderman.
[01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:24.660]   Yeah.
[01:09:24.660 --> 01:09:27.100]   And so this guy obviously is a checklist of hockey and rock climber.
[01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:28.820]   I'll be in the Olympics.
[01:09:28.820 --> 01:09:32.580]   This guy or Simone Biles who unfortunately has decided to drop out.
[01:09:32.580 --> 01:09:40.340]   But those people are willing to spend their entire life pursuing a singular passion, often
[01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:46.820]   to the detriment of everything else, including family life, financial success, everything.
[01:09:46.820 --> 01:09:51.180]   That's not you and me, Alex, or I would guess most we want to learn everything there is
[01:09:51.180 --> 01:09:53.380]   to know about everything there is.
[01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:54.380]   Right.
[01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:58.660]   I do wish that I had a couple of like, I think of the dream is like, well, I have a whole
[01:09:58.660 --> 01:09:59.900]   lifetime to do this one thing.
[01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:00.900]   Yeah.
[01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:06.780]   The the the maestro of any, although you're pretty much a maestro of video production and
[01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:10.860]   stuff, I guess you have one thing that you're very I mean, it's the, I mean, I've been doing
[01:10:10.860 --> 01:10:11.860]   that for 40 years.
[01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:16.020]   So you have to, by the way, that's what it takes.
[01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:20.740]   You have to, you know, you can't be a great violinist in a year.
[01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:21.740]   You just can't.
[01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:22.740]   Yeah.
[01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:26.820]   You know, we had a we had a, um, our, you know, I think I said, mentioned that after
[01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:31.540]   hours now goes 22 hours or 21 hours goes bit by bit.
[01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:35.940]   No, well, we, well, office hours is three hours and after hours is 21 hours.
[01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:38.260]   And so we, we felt you have it all there.
[01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:39.260]   Yeah.
[01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:44.820]   At the end of after hours today, Todd Reynolds, who is a filler monarch, a violinist, but
[01:10:44.820 --> 01:10:48.780]   he also does loops and electronic and everything else and mixes it all together.
[01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:52.220]   He, he came up, he came on and he said, Hey, I'm rehearsing something for Saturday.
[01:10:52.220 --> 01:10:53.220]   Do you guys want to hear it?
[01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:54.220]   Oh, yeah.
[01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:55.220]   That's awesome.
[01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:56.220]   Five minutes, five minutes.
[01:10:56.220 --> 01:11:01.300]   We just sat there and watched this incredible artist just kind of practice and his practice,
[01:11:01.300 --> 01:11:04.420]   of course, is better than anything I could even imagine doing myself.
[01:11:04.420 --> 01:11:08.060]   And, um, there was just, you know, but there's a way for what he and I are.
[01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:11.380]   And I don't don't don't be insulted, but dilettance.
[01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:12.860]   Uh, oh yeah.
[01:11:12.860 --> 01:11:13.860]   We love everything.
[01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:15.020]   We want to know everything.
[01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:19.100]   And then there are people who are willing to just put blinders on and I couldn't do this.
[01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:20.900]   But I will say that I go deep.
[01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:23.500]   I am very focused in the sense that like I don't read fiction because I think it's a
[01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:24.500]   waste of time.
[01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:25.500]   I'm going for me.
[01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:26.500]   There's not enough action.
[01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:27.500]   You do have to pick and choose because there's so much.
[01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:28.500]   Oh, you make it.
[01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:29.500]   See, I disagree.
[01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:33.260]   I think fiction is incredible, but I don't, I don't, I don't, I'll, to each other.
[01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:34.420]   But, but again, like I'm stingy.
[01:11:34.420 --> 01:11:35.780]   I'm very stingy about time.
[01:11:35.780 --> 01:11:39.140]   So I'm, I'm really interested in what I'm interested in, but you know, my, my, I think
[01:11:39.140 --> 01:11:42.260]   I've said this before, my, my wife can tell you where all the cheapest gases in Nevada
[01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:45.260]   and I can tell you every gas station with the right turn in the right turnout.
[01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:46.260]   Yeah.
[01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:47.420]   You know, like perfect example.
[01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:53.180]   Steve Jobs, very famously when the family was going to buy a new washing machine spent
[01:11:53.180 --> 01:12:00.020]   days, this is in the, in the Walter Isaacson biography researching washing machines and
[01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:01.020]   then every piece of furniture.
[01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:02.020]   Yeah.
[01:12:02.020 --> 01:12:05.060]   They had an empty house for like months because you made them do that with every piece of
[01:12:05.060 --> 01:12:06.060]   furniture.
[01:12:06.060 --> 01:12:09.860]   I admire people like that, but, but that's, but that's, but that is a problem.
[01:12:09.860 --> 01:12:14.060]   Sometimes the, I love the fact that if you say, Hey, I think I'll, I think I'll pick
[01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:19.100]   a birthday cake for my, for my spouse, the next week and I'll go on YouTube and find
[01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:21.260]   the best birthday cake recipe out there.
[01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:24.300]   And then you wind up going to the bakery because you spent too much time trying to find the
[01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:26.540]   perfect one when you should have just said, I know it.
[01:12:26.540 --> 01:12:28.140]   Here's this, there's supposed to be is good enough.
[01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:30.420]   I'm going to just muck in, do one practice cake.
[01:12:30.420 --> 01:12:31.420]   Learn from that.
[01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:32.420]   Yeah.
[01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:34.540]   The aphorism is the perfect is the enemy of the good.
[01:12:34.540 --> 01:12:35.540]   Exactly.
[01:12:35.540 --> 01:12:36.540]   Holds here.
[01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:40.700]   I think that was, but I guess my, my reverse is that as good enough as the enemy of great.
[01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:41.700]   Yeah.
[01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:43.900]   And I just, it's not enough time.
[01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:44.900]   I want to do it all.
[01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:45.900]   Yeah.
[01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:46.900]   I want to do it all.
[01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:47.900]   So let's talk a little bit about this briefly.
[01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:53.540]   This is an example. So for years, NFL films and the Olympics and wide world of sports
[01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:59.980]   understood that the way to make sports interesting is to talk to the human about the humans and
[01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:02.700]   give you the, the background about the humans and stuff.
[01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:08.220]   And I think, you know, NFL films kind of mastered the story telling about around sports.
[01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:11.460]   But I think there's something the internet can do that television never could do. And
[01:13:11.460 --> 01:13:16.820]   this is a really beautiful example from the New York Times about Adam Andra, the climber
[01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:23.540]   who's the best rock climber in the world, but who will not probably win gold, even though
[01:13:23.540 --> 01:13:28.980]   this is for the first time in the Olympics, because, well, it explains it. But what they've
[01:13:28.980 --> 01:13:35.260]   also done with this besides these great interviews and so forth, something TV can't do is show
[01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:42.740]   you, explain the different sports and the strategies and so forth. This is, I, this made
[01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:44.540]   me a fan of rock climbing.
[01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:45.540]   Yeah.
[01:13:45.540 --> 01:13:46.540]   It's non-linear.
[01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:52.140]   It's non-linear. And it shows you, you know, the strategies he's using. And I just thought
[01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:53.140]   this was brilliant.
[01:13:53.140 --> 01:13:54.540]   I have to admit, I do well.
[01:13:54.540 --> 01:13:58.180]   Better than the newspaper too, by the way, New York Times is learning that if you're going
[01:13:58.180 --> 01:14:01.340]   to succeed, you need to use the medium appropriately.
[01:14:01.340 --> 01:14:05.780]   Did you see Chuck Todd was on Neelay's new, Neelay Patel from The Verge has a new podcast
[01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:10.380]   called Decoder. He started it when the Caris Wisher left for the New York Times. And he
[01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:13.540]   said some really interesting guests. And this week it was Chuck Todd talking about how
[01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:17.340]   to meet the press, the oldest show on television can't survive on television anymore. So they're
[01:14:17.340 --> 01:14:21.300]   turning it into a brand. They'll be a Meet the Press show and we meet the press daily
[01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:25.780]   and to meet the press podcast and to meet the press like segment ties thing on the internet.
[01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:30.220]   It's going to be an entire empire. Meet the press because the TV alone isn't enough anymore.
[01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:34.700]   Well, and what they're looking at is stuff like the New York Times, which is, was a heritage
[01:14:34.700 --> 01:14:38.860]   technology that was dying. And the New York Times, unlike most newspapers, found a way
[01:14:38.860 --> 01:14:40.260]   to survive, right?
[01:14:40.260 --> 01:14:45.020]   Yeah, and it's not just about, well, we'll need to pivot to where the audience is. It
[01:14:45.020 --> 01:14:49.700]   really is seeing it as an opportunity, not as a desperation move. I mean, this was one
[01:14:49.700 --> 01:14:56.340]   of the reasons why I stopped writing for The Sun Times. It was mutual. But this is one
[01:14:56.340 --> 01:15:00.700]   of the reasons why I was trying to say, well, look, we don't have to just do like one or
[01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:05.340]   two columns a week that go into this editorial pipeline. I could do like a regular blog in
[01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:10.140]   which things that happen like at 1 p.m. I can at least talk about it at 1.30 p.m. and publish
[01:15:10.140 --> 01:15:16.500]   it immediately. And fortunately, at that time, at least The Sun Times was just so stodgy.
[01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:20.460]   And this workflow that it couldn't understand that just having something published on the
[01:15:20.460 --> 01:15:23.900]   web is not taking advantage of what the internet is.
[01:15:23.900 --> 01:15:28.100]   Oh, there's so much more to it. Yeah. And the main thing is, is that is that a lot of
[01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:34.020]   things you start realizing that a lot of constructs are created because of a limitation. And then
[01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:39.540]   we just live inside of that limitation all the time. So you look at like we, because like
[01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:46.420]   this morning we had a Jotto tool, who's the founder CEO of sound devices on talking about
[01:15:46.420 --> 01:15:50.060]   their new transmitter, which is really cool. But we did that for an hour and we all asked
[01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:54.700]   a bunch of questions and we'll do that again tomorrow with someone else. And the big thing
[01:15:54.700 --> 01:15:57.860]   is that we used to go to, we had to go to conventions. And the reason you did that is
[01:15:57.860 --> 01:15:59.820]   because it was hard to get everybody together.
[01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:04.740]   We had to, we had to show this off. And this, I was thinking about it when I got out of
[01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:09.020]   that. It was like, and it was better than going to a booth because it wasn't what my
[01:16:09.020 --> 01:16:13.540]   questions were. It was what everybody's questions were. And we were all able to kind of build
[01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:18.780]   off of each other's questions to understand a new product. And the main thing is when
[01:16:18.780 --> 01:16:23.940]   you think about that with conventions, conventions, or even like I looked at a Sony was doing
[01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:27.100]   some kind of webinar this morning. And I was just kind of like, okay, we're trying to do
[01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:30.260]   this thing that feels like an event. And I was like, you know, if you just did something
[01:16:30.260 --> 01:16:33.260]   every day where you're talking about your products, I probably just go up and go up
[01:16:33.260 --> 01:16:37.380]   better product that I'm interested in. It would cost the same amount of money. Then doing
[01:16:37.380 --> 01:16:41.020]   something, trying to do something shiny for once. You know, it would, you know, just daily
[01:16:41.020 --> 01:16:45.500]   interaction with your audience is going to, but we can, the key is here is that we're
[01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:50.700]   just no longer limited by time and space, you know, and we keep on living inside of that
[01:16:50.700 --> 01:16:55.260]   for Andy. It was, or for the Chicago Chicago, sometimes it was their print schedule. Like
[01:16:55.260 --> 01:16:58.900]   this is how we do this thing. That was the limitation that they had. And they just didn't
[01:16:58.900 --> 01:17:03.260]   have a way out of it. The key that New York Times did that I think was they got ahead
[01:17:03.260 --> 01:17:08.020]   of it while they still had a good business. They built the new business. The problem you
[01:17:08.020 --> 01:17:16.060]   get into with print, you know, in music and coming soon TV is that they're not, they just
[01:17:16.060 --> 01:17:19.460]   keep on living off of what they have. And they're not taking advantage and extending
[01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:26.820]   out into a new platform and using their current viewership to move into the new thing. Because
[01:17:26.820 --> 01:17:30.820]   if they don't do that, they won't have a thing to move into it because then they lose
[01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:33.780]   that audience. So now they can build it up from scratch.
[01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:37.380]   It's spectacularly hard to do. The New York Times success really is more the exception
[01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:42.460]   that proves the rule that the innovators dilemma really just stops incumbents from going to
[01:17:42.460 --> 01:17:45.860]   the next thing. It always takes a startup or a new company to do it. You know, when the
[01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:50.300]   internet first started, it was obvious that people were just going to treat it as something
[01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:54.180]   they already knew if we were magazine to be a magazine, if you're a newspaper, be a newspaper
[01:17:54.180 --> 01:17:59.700]   of TV, it'd be a TV. But also was obvious, at least to me, that that isn't what the internet
[01:17:59.700 --> 01:18:04.940]   is. And it's going to take a new generation of people who are internet natives. And it's
[01:18:04.940 --> 01:18:08.820]   going to take decades before they really start using the internet to its potential. I think
[01:18:08.820 --> 01:18:14.660]   we're just, I mean, this is a good example. We're just starting on tick talk. Like people
[01:18:14.660 --> 01:18:18.940]   are short form video native now and using, like just pressing the button, letting go,
[01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:21.300]   pressing the button, turning their head, letting go. Isn't that amazing?
[01:18:21.300 --> 01:18:29.500]   Ways that are inventing those cameras that that arm could do. It's pretty amazing. And
[01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:32.460]   some people are doing VFX that were as good as television like four or five years ago,
[01:18:32.460 --> 01:18:34.780]   which was not taken away from them, but it's unbelievable. They're doing that on their
[01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:39.940]   phone in their bedrooms like flash moves and superhero moves. It's normal. I mean,
[01:18:39.940 --> 01:18:46.340]   I look at myself, you know, I'm, I did, I turned podcasting into radio. That's not necessarily
[01:18:46.340 --> 01:18:52.260]   what podcasting is, but that's what I knew. I guess for the little TV thrown in. And that's
[01:18:52.260 --> 01:18:56.220]   what I knew. And I know, you know, I don't know if I can innovate at this point. I'm
[01:18:56.220 --> 01:19:01.460]   really glad to see somebody like you, Alex, innovating in that space. Office hours.global,
[01:19:01.460 --> 01:19:05.540]   if you want to know more about, we've been talking a lot about office hours. Let's change
[01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:12.220]   the subject. We'll do that in a sec. I'm wonderful to have our panel here, Alex Lindsey, office
[01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:20.580]   hours.global. And, and I don't want to give short shift to your day job. Zero.media. What
[01:19:20.580 --> 01:19:28.220]   do you do at 090 media? I mostly work on my title as head of operations, but really I,
[01:19:28.220 --> 01:19:33.540]   what I do is I work on complex audio and video pipelines. So mostly as they relate to high
[01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:40.140]   dynamic range and, and yes, huge expertise in this. And people hire him. And oh, and I
[01:19:40.140 --> 01:19:45.620]   know media to get that done. This is office hours.global. I'm showing right here. So yes,
[01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:52.100]   if you need that expertise, you know where to go. Andy Inaco, whose regular appearances
[01:19:52.100 --> 01:19:57.220]   WGBH in Boston every week. Are you, I think you're going to be in the Boston Public Library
[01:19:57.220 --> 01:20:01.540]   soon? Yes. Yes. It was supposed to be this week. It had to be postponed one week, but
[01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:08.060]   next, next Thursday, I will be back in the studios at the Boston Public Library. I'll
[01:20:08.060 --> 01:20:11.540]   remind people next week because it'd be great if people come by and say hello and I'll hang
[01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:14.980]   out and we can talk about all of the things I was wrong about. I keep worrying that, you
[01:20:14.980 --> 01:20:21.540]   know, this Delta variant and the surges that we emerged, we stuck our heads out and like
[01:20:21.540 --> 01:20:26.460]   a Max and Tony. You know what? We saw shadows and went right back. No, no, you're absolutely
[01:20:26.460 --> 01:20:32.300]   right. The, the, the Boston Comic Con was supposed to be next week, but they decided
[01:20:32.300 --> 01:20:39.020]   to delay it one month. And I'm so glad for it because we're asked I was such a, like,
[01:20:39.020 --> 01:20:43.380]   such a week maybe on, even though I bought my tickets like months ago. So I'm like,
[01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:48.300]   $900 bucks in. It's like, I don't sure if I'm ready to be in a big and close space.
[01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:51.900]   Next month, I'm still a maybe, but at least I get a month to waffle about it. I could
[01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:57.660]   tell you it was a little scary being in Hawaii with a lot of people cheeked by Jell. It was,
[01:20:57.660 --> 01:21:02.700]   I'm going to a baseball game Thursday, a Giants game with my son. I'm a little nervous. It's
[01:21:02.700 --> 01:21:06.340]   like, I think I'm going to wear a mask. I was going to visit, I was going to visit family
[01:21:06.340 --> 01:21:11.860]   in, in Provincetown last week, but they recently had such a spike that they reinstated their,
[01:21:11.860 --> 01:21:15.500]   their mask mandate because the Delta variant. So while you're there, pick up some herbs
[01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:24.900]   of Provincetown for, for, oh, time to province down. Yeah, what's going on in Montreal? I
[01:21:24.900 --> 01:21:30.140]   asked Georgia on Sunday because she's there to, she says, get better. We never stopped
[01:21:30.140 --> 01:21:34.260]   our mask, man. I'm so grateful because the CDC waffle, I think they waffled big and they
[01:21:34.260 --> 01:21:37.580]   waffled early because they were wanting to appease people. And it was the exact wrong
[01:21:37.580 --> 01:21:41.940]   thing to do. And if you, and I get it, I totally get people are so frustrated because we feel
[01:21:41.940 --> 01:21:46.220]   like we stayed indoors. We wore masks, we socially distance. We did everything to protect people
[01:21:46.220 --> 01:21:49.380]   who were in serious need. And now a bunch of you are just flouting the regulations and
[01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:52.980]   you're flaring up Delta and making us do all the precautions again. And just, but I mean,
[01:21:52.980 --> 01:21:56.380]   like, these aren't, these aren't, these are people who don't have the best information.
[01:21:56.380 --> 01:21:59.200]   We got to be compassionate. I don't blame them. No, I agree. I don't
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:05.060]   like them. They're being lied to. Yeah. Yes. Essentially. And then there are some people
[01:22:05.060 --> 01:22:08.900]   with vaccine hesitancy for good reason. If I were an African American, I would think
[01:22:08.900 --> 01:22:15.140]   back to the Tuskegee studies. Native cultures too. I mean, for sure. But yeah, there's just
[01:22:15.140 --> 01:22:18.580]   so there's such an advantage to like, we for the first time we have the capabilities,
[01:22:18.580 --> 01:22:21.900]   the technology, the medicine to push back the literal play. It's a miracle. And we're
[01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:27.100]   just choosing a freaking miracle. And we're turning our back on it. You know, they say
[01:22:27.100 --> 01:22:33.060]   a lot of countries would say God will provide God provided an mRNA vaccine. I sent you a
[01:22:33.060 --> 01:22:40.820]   helicopter. What are you doing? Some countries are so desperate for vaccines. That's another
[01:22:40.820 --> 01:22:45.860]   big problem because even if we were 100% vaccinated in the US, we're a rich nation.
[01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:49.980]   There are plenty of nations. At least we have the option of being silly and saying no.
[01:22:49.980 --> 01:22:53.740]   There are other countries that were like, for God's sake, everybody who's saying that
[01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:57.580]   you're not, you don't trust this, great, send me your dose. They'll be. And I say this with
[01:22:57.580 --> 01:23:00.660]   like a huge amount of compassion. But if you think it's a political issue, please delete
[01:23:00.660 --> 01:23:05.900]   Facebook, please uninstall cable news, go spend some quality time in the library and

[01:23:12.500 --> 01:23:19.740]   Richie Rene is also pushing the bleeding edge of what can be done. You went from writing
[01:23:19.740 --> 01:23:27.020]   to video has that was that a hard transition? It was hard only in that I started writing
[01:23:27.020 --> 01:23:31.940]   video, which is not the best, most natural, authentic, deliver, same thing, right? You
[01:23:31.940 --> 01:23:34.940]   take what you know and you apply it to the new medium and it's not necessarily the best
[01:23:34.940 --> 01:23:38.860]   thing for the new medium. Yeah, but I got yelled at by a bunch of really smart people.
[01:23:38.860 --> 01:23:44.900]   And now I'm working, I'm working my way towards fully. What's the right word when you speak
[01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:47.460]   off the cuff video? So that'll be a big transition.
[01:23:47.460 --> 01:23:52.180]   Extemporaneously. Extemporaneous. Yes, perfect. I'm a fan of off the cuff just because I'm
[01:23:52.180 --> 01:23:58.620]   lazy. Lazy this is a pure mental thing. Like I can sit here and talk to you and Andy and
[01:23:58.620 --> 01:24:02.380]   Alex also talk my head like continuously, but if it's just me staring at that camera,
[01:24:02.380 --> 01:24:06.900]   I know suddenly I'm falling all over my side. You know, I was I was at first a little upset
[01:24:06.900 --> 01:24:13.420]   about the news that Spotify bought a podcast, a single show for $20 million a year for three
[01:24:13.420 --> 01:24:19.860]   years, $60 million to the call her daddy podcast. And then I listened to it. And I realized,
[01:24:19.860 --> 01:24:24.260]   you know what Alex Cooper is actually really talented because she does one of the hardest
[01:24:24.260 --> 01:24:29.900]   things there is to do in broadcasting was to sit down all alone in her bedroom with a
[01:24:29.900 --> 01:24:36.060]   microphone and connect. And I don't know if she's worth $20 million a year. That's a
[01:24:36.060 --> 01:24:40.300]   lot of money. I don't know if anybody any of us are worth that much, but I'm glad she
[01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:43.300]   got it because and she is a real talent. It's really interesting.
[01:24:43.300 --> 01:24:46.980]   She got her primal branding down. Like I first found out who she was when they had that
[01:24:46.980 --> 01:24:51.020]   huge controversy about her and her partner splitting up and trying to get a deal off
[01:24:51.020 --> 01:24:55.540]   of bar stool and the bar stool CEO got involved. It was just so much popcorn drama. But then
[01:24:55.540 --> 01:25:00.380]   you like she went on by the way, they say is good for ratings. I hear. Yes. It was huge
[01:25:00.380 --> 01:25:06.300]   for ratings. There were so much more afterwards. But the primal branding of like everything
[01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:09.900]   like they have like daddy gang and they make people feel included and they have their value
[01:25:09.900 --> 01:25:14.500]   propositions, insiders and outsiders. And you can go straight down the primal branding
[01:25:14.500 --> 01:25:19.140]   book and everything. And a lot of really successful media personalities do that. They have their
[01:25:19.140 --> 01:25:22.540]   little pet like we have that here at Twit to it's phenomenal. It works really, really
[01:25:22.540 --> 01:25:27.100]   well. Yeah. And I don't know about her. We did it kind of unconsciously. I bet she did
[01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:33.580]   too. She's only 26, but she had a gut instinct that was, you know, really worked out. You
[01:25:33.580 --> 01:25:40.540]   know, for years I worked in radio where they would fake these feuds. I remember WNBC Don
[01:25:40.540 --> 01:25:44.660]   Imus and the sports guy down there who I worked with. Don Imus and everybody though,
[01:25:44.660 --> 01:25:49.180]   right? Yeah. Don was famous for this. He knew how to do it. I mean, he was a he whether
[01:25:49.180 --> 01:25:54.500]   it was his natural point of view, a gut instinct where he was very calculated. He knew exactly
[01:25:54.500 --> 01:26:00.740]   how to do it. He was in a feud with Franklin. I can't remember his name. I used to work
[01:26:00.740 --> 01:26:04.740]   with him and he told me this whole time. But the Imus would like Franklin would go and
[01:26:04.740 --> 01:26:10.620]   literally take the microphones out of Imus's studio. So Imus would come into the morning
[01:26:10.620 --> 01:26:15.940]   show and he'd have to do it by phone. I mean, they it was, but the thing is both of them
[01:26:15.940 --> 01:26:20.100]   pretended the feud, but they knew this is good for ratings. This is a this is a winner
[01:26:20.100 --> 01:26:23.700]   in ratings. And call call her daddy is also a millennial section, which has a much bigger
[01:26:23.700 --> 01:26:27.580]   potential audience than we have for Spotify Leo. Well, I understand that topic matters
[01:26:27.580 --> 01:26:33.380]   to if I could have done a millennial section. Believe me, I will. I'll never I mean, that's
[01:26:33.380 --> 01:26:37.860]   you know, it'd be very different. That always works. I remember when we got a big shot producer
[01:26:37.860 --> 01:26:42.060]   to come in on the screen savers at tech TV. First thing he says, you need more cleavage.
[01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:47.740]   It's like, yeah, no, and Leo's like, I'm wearing a V. Now, how much cleavage can that guy give
[01:26:47.740 --> 01:26:49.900]   you here? Anyway,
[01:26:49.900 --> 01:26:50.900]   whatever.
[01:26:50.900 --> 01:27:00.580]   Should be I'm sorry, but we're right now, more cleavage and we need more cleavage. Ted
[01:27:00.580 --> 01:27:11.900]   Lasso is back, baby. And it's season debut, very, very successful. Big hit for Apple TV.
[01:27:11.900 --> 01:27:18.340]   I think this is the was the number two. Let me see here. Demand share is increased by
[01:27:18.340 --> 01:27:24.980]   54% second most in demand digital original in the US right behind Loki. And I would argue
[01:27:24.980 --> 01:27:27.100]   a little bit more satisfying than Loki.
[01:27:27.100 --> 01:27:34.860]   Well, there's no alligator Ted Lasso. So it's hard to compare most in demand a show overall.
[01:27:34.860 --> 01:27:40.940]   Forty times the audience demand in the average show. So and successful globally to 18th and
[01:27:40.940 --> 01:27:46.860]   most in demand to show in the world. So very good news for Apple, which needed to hit really
[01:27:46.860 --> 01:27:52.020]   new. It's it's it's good by any standard. No matter what channel it might be, it might
[01:27:52.020 --> 01:27:56.780]   have been on whatever production company and whatever distributor was able to produce that
[01:27:56.780 --> 01:28:02.020]   show was going to have a big hit. I think that was it's a good show. I have I still made
[01:28:02.020 --> 01:28:08.380]   it to the end of the first season, only because it seems to be my my iPad show because because
[01:28:08.380 --> 01:28:12.020]   at the Apple TV app is on it, but I don't necessarily have the Apple TV app on all my
[01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:17.220]   other streamers. But my God, the level of quality every time that every time that they
[01:28:17.220 --> 01:28:20.780]   you see that they're you think that they're setting up something that you've seen before
[01:28:20.780 --> 01:28:24.340]   in terms, okay, well, this character is going to be this kind of person. Okay, well, obviously
[01:28:24.340 --> 01:28:27.980]   they're going to go down this road. Nope, they're they're bored by that they don't take the
[01:28:27.980 --> 01:28:31.460]   first bus. They find something that's more interesting. So yeah, it's great stuff.
[01:28:31.460 --> 01:28:37.060]   It is the biggest show and the biggest premier Apple TV plus has ever had. And right in the
[01:28:37.060 --> 01:28:42.020]   nick of time because they're starting to charge. You need a TV show that makes you feel like
[01:28:42.020 --> 01:28:46.060]   you were struck by lightning Leo. That's what you do. You you were I think the first person
[01:28:46.060 --> 01:28:51.140]   to tell us about it, Renee, you you were early. I got surrounded called world very early.
[01:28:51.140 --> 01:28:54.660]   She watched it and said you have to you are the tech Ted Lasso and you have to watch this.
[01:28:54.660 --> 01:29:00.900]   Oh, you are the tech Ted Lasso. Oh my God. Believe Leo, believe you are you need a big
[01:29:00.900 --> 01:29:05.580]   paper sign above your head. I need a mustache. No, you don't need a must. How's your how's
[01:29:05.580 --> 01:29:10.340]   your shortbread? I am working on it. The YouTube video I've been watching is from
[01:29:10.340 --> 01:29:16.380]   Ken's Candy Alt Lopez. It's very good. Oh, I bet Kenji has the best. You know, we interviewed
[01:29:16.380 --> 01:29:20.980]   him for the new screensavers a few years ago. We went to went down to his house and he
[01:29:20.980 --> 01:29:27.700]   cooked for us. And little did I know what a special thing that was. He's got a GoPro
[01:29:27.700 --> 01:29:32.540]   on his head. That's his whole YouTube channel. He's amazing. I know he's amazing. So Elon
[01:29:32.540 --> 01:29:39.500]   Musk, you know, again, the the magnet for controversy. The side of the lawns got Elon
[01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:51.060]   got a on Sunday. Slag Apple just a little bit. He said he said our batteries use a minimal
[01:29:51.060 --> 01:29:58.220]   amount of cobalt unlike that fruit company. Apple he says uses I think almost 100% cobalt
[01:29:58.220 --> 01:30:03.460]   in their batteries, cell phones and laptops. Tesla uses no cobalt in the iron phosphate
[01:30:03.460 --> 01:30:08.500]   packs and almost none in the nickel based chemistries on a weighted weighted average basis. We might
[01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:14.860]   use 2% of the cobalt compared to apples 100% cobalt. So this is a gun. This is in response
[01:30:14.860 --> 01:30:21.780]   to the fact that cobalt is oftentimes mined by children in countries that aren't very
[01:30:21.780 --> 01:30:25.020]   democratic. Don't believe Apple makes it on batteries. I think they use Samsung and other
[01:30:25.020 --> 01:30:29.940]   vendor batteries. And Apple in its defense said we are we really work hard with our suppliers
[01:30:29.940 --> 01:30:35.220]   and we have a suppliers code and we make sure that they live up to that code. So yeah,
[01:30:35.220 --> 01:30:39.980]   we may use cobalt, but it's not mined by children. Yeah. So and it also needs to be said that
[01:30:39.980 --> 01:30:45.580]   although almost every single tech company has something like that. Oh, we have we have
[01:30:45.580 --> 01:30:49.700]   we keep an eye on our suppliers. We have contractual obligations for them not to use
[01:30:49.700 --> 01:30:53.900]   certain label. That's but oftentimes that's just there to insulate themselves for when
[01:30:53.900 --> 01:30:59.060]   the scandal hits. Apple really, really does go above and beyond to make sure that they
[01:30:59.060 --> 01:31:03.220]   just they make it very, very clear in their deeds, not just their statements that they
[01:31:03.220 --> 01:31:09.180]   don't want to be using any materials that's being used by bad labor. They audited all
[01:31:09.180 --> 01:31:14.340]   the cobalt suppliers last year and they continue to do that. And I think that that's that's
[01:31:14.340 --> 01:31:19.620]   Apple's very committed to that. So I'll defend Apple in this in this case. He also this is
[01:31:19.620 --> 01:31:24.100]   by the way during the Tesla earnings call. He also said, I think we want to emphasize
[01:31:24.100 --> 01:31:29.300]   our goals to support the advent of sustainable energy. It's not to create a walled garden
[01:31:29.300 --> 01:31:33.380]   and you use that to bludgeon our competitors, which is used by some companies, then he
[01:31:33.380 --> 01:31:41.220]   coughed and went, Apple, Apple. He's such a child. I mean, that's why we have to play
[01:31:41.220 --> 01:31:46.020]   on Teslas. I mean, it's it's it's really a wonderful. Yeah. Yeah. That's all I've any.
[01:31:46.020 --> 01:31:49.420]   Yeah, that's by the way, that was the number one of the number one reasons I didn't buy
[01:31:49.420 --> 01:31:54.740]   another Tesla is I wanted car play. And I don't like the Tesla media player. But but
[01:31:54.740 --> 01:31:58.620]   also it's it's a starkly funny. He's talking. Yeah, exactly. It's a starkly funny that he's
[01:31:58.620 --> 01:32:05.340]   talking about walled gardens, given that like chargers are Tesla only. Well, but but also
[01:32:05.340 --> 01:32:11.820]   but also that like if if if a single like $30 part on a on a Tesla fails, you have to send
[01:32:11.820 --> 01:32:15.820]   it back to Tesla. They decide that, Oh, well, we don't want to sell you just one part off
[01:32:15.820 --> 01:32:20.780]   of a battery pack. We want to sell you an $18,000 battery pack. And no, we won't help independent
[01:32:20.780 --> 01:32:27.060]   shops figure out how to fix our own stuff. It's like, okay. Elon's got to Elon. Yeah.
[01:32:27.060 --> 01:32:31.380]   But if there was a if there was an apple coin, he would have totally pumped and dumped it.
[01:32:31.380 --> 01:32:39.460]   So it's big, a really nice online production NPR is doing some great stuff. This is an NPR
[01:32:39.460 --> 01:32:46.180]   story who will pay to protect tech giants from rising seas. It's got a lot of video and
[01:32:46.180 --> 01:32:51.620]   illustrations and a map that points out kind of where they'll be fine. It's us that are in
[01:32:51.620 --> 01:32:56.340]   trouble. Well, you have to say that I find the scrolling this new scrolling thing that both
[01:32:56.340 --> 01:33:03.460]   NPR and white. It's very stressful. Yeah. Like it. Clearly there's it's a some CSS technique.
[01:33:03.460 --> 01:33:08.420]   So but but is I mean, yeah, I agree with you. So it takes too long to acquire the
[01:33:08.420 --> 01:33:14.820]   like you have to scroll through it. Yeah. But but I can read that. The point is well taken. Google
[01:33:14.820 --> 01:33:21.860]   is right there on the San Francisco Bay as is Facebook. This is I think I don't know. I think
[01:33:21.860 --> 01:33:27.620]   if the Cupertino campus for Apple is a little bit farther, but not so much farther. This
[01:33:27.620 --> 01:33:31.940]   spaceship floats though, right? That's all reason it is like that. It can take off lies. It covers.
[01:33:31.940 --> 01:33:39.780]   Yeah. It's moving. It becomes a part of there. So it is it. It does speak to a larger issue that
[01:33:39.780 --> 01:33:46.900]   given that so much the supply chain is isolated depending on not only manufacturing is as isolated
[01:33:46.900 --> 01:33:51.060]   in certain locations for certain product lines, but also the raw materials that you're getting to
[01:33:51.060 --> 01:33:55.940]   make batteries to make certain products is isolated in certain places. A flood that takes out that
[01:33:55.940 --> 01:34:02.420]   that was seen that. I'm not trying to exactly that that causes a huge ripple effect. So and
[01:34:02.420 --> 01:34:08.500]   there's a the human the human impact is a lot worse, of course. But later on, you start thinking
[01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:15.060]   that well, this is why we can't manufacture phones in time to for a fall release. This is why we
[01:34:15.060 --> 01:34:20.180]   can't rely on batteries being replaced on the regular timetable they're supposed to because
[01:34:20.180 --> 01:34:25.540]   there was a because of global warming. We had this title change that was not anticipated when
[01:34:25.540 --> 01:34:30.580]   this factory was cited 30 years ago. And as a result, the entire industry is very, very vulnerable.
[01:34:30.580 --> 01:34:34.340]   I forget who it was. It was a paper I was reading that said, you think that movie,
[01:34:34.340 --> 01:34:38.980]   the Kingsman where Samuel Jackson is a billionaire who pretends not to care about climate change,
[01:34:38.980 --> 01:34:43.060]   because it's going to just destroy the 50% of the poorest people on earth, which is an advantage
[01:34:43.060 --> 01:34:46.820]   to him as a joke. But that's actually how a lot of the big companies are looking at it. They're
[01:34:46.820 --> 01:34:50.740]   financially solvent enough to survive any of these changes. And it's just it's going to
[01:34:50.740 --> 01:34:54.980]   result in less competition and less reasons for them. I'm not sure the resource competition for
[01:34:54.980 --> 01:35:00.420]   them. I don't know if Facebook owns the old the the buildings that are the old Facebook,
[01:35:00.420 --> 01:35:04.420]   not the new Facebook building. They own that. I'm not sure if they I think they lease those
[01:35:04.420 --> 01:35:08.580]   buildings. Yeah, that's a long term. They're building. I'm just saying I'm just saying that
[01:35:08.580 --> 01:35:11.940]   they I don't know when the leases and I don't know how it goes. The I thought it was interesting
[01:35:11.940 --> 01:35:16.500]   in the article that I didn't know is that that the new Facebook building is actually I think,
[01:35:16.500 --> 01:35:20.180]   you know, what is it? A certain number of feet off the ground like there's no offices.
[01:35:20.180 --> 01:35:23.540]   It's all parking below. Yeah. So if there was a if there was a huge wave,
[01:35:23.540 --> 01:35:26.580]   it would literally go under the office. You got to think they've been thinking about it.
[01:35:26.580 --> 01:35:31.860]   So many foot raise in the sea level. And it'll just be no parking, but we probably won't wet
[01:35:31.860 --> 01:35:35.620]   cars by then anyway. So what is what is Phil Schiller and his Lamborghini going to think about
[01:35:35.620 --> 01:35:42.340]   it? It's true. It's true. Did you see that video Leo? No, Phil Schiller is on Lamborghini.com. He's
[01:35:42.340 --> 01:35:49.460]   got to he's got a Q&A and a reminiscence about the importance of passion in design on Lamborghini.com.
[01:35:49.460 --> 01:35:53.300]   He's on the board. He's more pertinent. Is he on the board? Oh, and he cues on the Ferrari board.
[01:35:53.300 --> 01:35:58.740]   Phil Schiller is just an enthusiast of all of these Volkswagen auto group. Yeah, Porsche and.
[01:35:58.740 --> 01:36:03.620]   There is that his Lambo? It's the second one. That's the second one that's more apt for us.
[01:36:03.620 --> 01:36:07.460]   Oh, okay. Let's move down a little bit here. Apple fellow Phil Schiller.
[01:36:09.060 --> 01:36:14.260]   Oh, he has a what is that called a count? Cuntak. Cuntak? I don't know if he has one. He has the
[01:36:14.260 --> 01:36:19.060]   918 though, which is a very and he has a singer. You can't drive this on the road. Right above this.
[01:36:19.060 --> 01:36:24.420]   Can you drive this? Sure. You can. You're allowed to. Yeah, the country.
[01:36:24.420 --> 01:36:28.660]   Should you? It's the question. Yeah, you can't take it anywhere. You're going to park it. I think
[01:36:28.660 --> 01:36:33.140]   that's usually or you have to park it. It's actually on to the apples unless and in your
[01:36:33.140 --> 01:36:37.140]   underground player, unless you want influencers to line up, get their selfies in front of it.
[01:36:37.140 --> 01:36:42.260]   Yeah, with the hashtag living best life. He's most proud. He asked him, what's your favorite
[01:36:42.260 --> 01:36:46.740]   Lamborghini? He said the next one. My favorite. Well, so excited about it.
[01:36:46.740 --> 01:36:50.900]   The three. He's most proud of the iPod. That was his favorite. He's my wife. Product that he's.
[01:36:50.900 --> 01:36:58.100]   You better say that. I would always say combustion, but I'm getting ready for electric. I think
[01:36:58.100 --> 01:37:03.060]   the world. And when you get electric Lambo, you will love it. But companies like Lamborghini can
[01:37:03.060 --> 01:37:08.180]   do to bring efficiency. You'll have range of 20 miles. But boy, will you have great torque.
[01:37:08.180 --> 01:37:13.220]   All right. Anyway, that's a range of 20 miles already. I know it's not that much different.
[01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:18.980]   You used to it. Hey, I thought I would get Alex to comment on this Lucas film has hired a
[01:37:18.980 --> 01:37:27.460]   YouTube deep faker who did a better job than Lucas film did of the Luke Leia and Tarkin cameos.
[01:37:27.460 --> 01:37:33.220]   Here's a deep. Actually, you know what? This guy got away with it and didn't get sued by Lucas
[01:37:33.220 --> 01:37:36.340]   film for doing this, but I'm not going to play it because Lucas film is good. Lucas film is
[01:37:36.340 --> 01:37:44.820]   generally very tolerant. Okay, good. So apparently, this guy is good at his his name is Shumoke.
[01:37:44.820 --> 01:37:49.140]   Warner Brothers who are jerks. Yeah. Isn't he usually my. I still I'm not going to take the chance.
[01:37:49.140 --> 01:37:56.900]   And he's got a job at ILM now. Yeah, I think that it's a different approach.
[01:37:56.900 --> 01:38:01.460]   You know, so using deep fakes as an approach to do that is different than what ILM has done,
[01:38:01.460 --> 01:38:06.260]   which has generally been explicit control over the character. At least my knowledge of it is
[01:38:06.260 --> 01:38:10.980]   really they're building a which is incredibly difficult is to build a photo real version
[01:38:10.980 --> 01:38:17.540]   of that person. And it just never has completely got over the edge. Now, I'll argue that he's not
[01:38:17.540 --> 01:38:21.620]   necessarily doing better. He's doing different. There's definitely things inside of that solution
[01:38:21.620 --> 01:38:27.540]   that don't work all the time. So neither of them are 100%. Some people will say one's better than
[01:38:27.540 --> 01:38:33.220]   the other, but it's obvious that there's a lot of possibility. And if you took someone like that
[01:38:33.220 --> 01:38:39.300]   that really knows it and then hand hands them to the to the scientists and computational engineers
[01:38:39.300 --> 01:38:46.180]   at at ILM, the mixture of this will be a lot more powerful than than him working by himself or
[01:38:46.180 --> 01:38:50.660]   ILM trying to reproduce what he's already thought through. So it's probably a relatively inexpensive
[01:38:50.660 --> 01:38:56.740]   purchase, not purchased, but but higher for ILM. Yeah, is it's easier. It's easier. He's
[01:38:56.740 --> 01:39:02.980]   still to save them by their resume. Yeah. Shamuk's new title is senior facial capture artist.
[01:39:02.980 --> 01:39:11.460]   He's gonna he's gonna know every pimple and mole on every actor everywhere inside the
[01:39:11.460 --> 01:39:16.660]   Lucas film. Did he do deep play Tonkros? Was he deep? Was somebody else? I don't know. I don't
[01:39:16.660 --> 01:39:21.620]   I'm not familiar with with their work, but still that's cool. The deep fake Tonkros is great because
[01:39:21.620 --> 01:39:26.740]   they took they took a look alike of Tonkros and deep faked him. So yeah, so they had a lot of the
[01:39:26.740 --> 01:39:31.060]   manner of the manner of the house. It was a little easier to do. I don't know how your Italian is,
[01:39:31.060 --> 01:39:36.620]   but if you listen to this broadcast of the Olympics from the Italian broadcaster Euro
[01:39:36.620 --> 01:39:46.020]   Sport, he's talking about the women's volleyball, but then he thinks turns off his microphone and
[01:39:46.020 --> 01:39:58.260]   asks the technician for the password to the computer. And announces it on the air. So good.
[01:39:58.260 --> 01:40:05.300]   Someone needs to watch that training video again. I think he's making fun of the password, by the way.
[01:40:05.300 --> 01:40:08.500]   Porca mizeria.
[01:40:09.860 --> 01:40:15.940]   Aren't in bikinis. This is so unfair. Oh, I know. Did you love it? The pink is paying the fine.
[01:40:15.940 --> 01:40:22.900]   For the Norwegian women's volleyballers who don't want to wear bikinis and
[01:40:22.900 --> 01:40:29.540]   considering shirts. That was just whatever I whatever these athletes feel as though the right
[01:40:29.540 --> 01:40:33.140]   is the most comfortable and appropriate thing to wear, they should be able to wear it. I always
[01:40:33.140 --> 01:40:39.300]   the moment I saw that it was the years ago, it's like they can't possibly want that can't possibly
[01:40:39.300 --> 01:40:42.660]   be the most comfortable thing to play beach volleyball. And it's just disgusting.
[01:40:42.660 --> 01:40:47.220]   Actually, correct myself. It was the handball team, which is even more ridiculous.
[01:40:47.220 --> 01:40:48.820]   Come on.
[01:40:48.820 --> 01:40:58.260]   Beach handball. This might be a mistranslation. There's beach handball.
[01:40:58.260 --> 01:41:04.660]   It's like volleyball, but you're doing with your hands. I don't know.
[01:41:05.700 --> 01:41:10.420]   I got this good for you, pink. I don't know if they. Yeah, there's there they are, and they're
[01:41:10.420 --> 01:41:14.900]   wearing still pretty sexy shorts. They're not just didn't want to wear bikini bottoms, and I don't
[01:41:14.900 --> 01:41:20.820]   blame them. Where would you want? Was it one of the German gymnastics team that's like,
[01:41:20.820 --> 01:41:23.940]   guess what? We're going to be wearing leggings from now on. We're not.
[01:41:23.940 --> 01:41:30.100]   I like that. Yeah, let's stop sexualizing. It's come back ever separates and we get to go to the
[01:41:30.100 --> 01:41:33.860]   Olympics. We will wear speedos and we should have the right to do that. And if you want to wear a
[01:41:33.860 --> 01:41:37.460]   speedo, you go right ahead. I just don't have to. That's what we were in Florida. That's what
[01:41:37.460 --> 01:41:43.860]   we're going to wear to the Olympics. Work the other way around, too. There was a, I think it was
[01:41:43.860 --> 01:41:49.860]   not the Olympics, but international track competition where one runner, one female runner was chastised
[01:41:49.860 --> 01:41:54.660]   by a judge saying, Oh, you're, you're short or two revealing and too sexy. And she said,
[01:41:54.660 --> 01:41:59.300]   these are the same shorts that everybody wears for for lightness and freedom of movement.
[01:41:59.300 --> 01:42:04.260]   Go to hell. It's like, you know, good for her. If you think these are, if you think these are two,
[01:42:04.260 --> 01:42:09.460]   if you as a guy male think these are too sexy, then that's about you and your reaction and your
[01:42:09.460 --> 01:42:14.100]   feelings. Don't make me, you know, change what I'm doing. That's again, it's just disgusting.
[01:42:14.100 --> 01:42:19.380]   Every time this isn't about the sports and about, you know, this, this, anyway, it's
[01:42:19.380 --> 01:42:22.740]   well, I think that the same thing with creators talk about their work. Don't talk about their
[01:42:22.740 --> 01:42:27.700]   appearance. Like just don't go on the video and be that person. I did however. Why do I have to shave?
[01:42:27.700 --> 01:42:30.500]   That's why I'm asking. No, that's my life.
[01:42:30.500 --> 01:42:33.220]   In men's beach volleyball.
[01:42:33.220 --> 01:42:40.260]   I'm going to Poland. There's a new museum opening in Poland later this year dedicated to
[01:42:40.260 --> 01:42:45.700]   Apple and its products. This should be really you got Renee, you got to do a show about this.
[01:42:45.700 --> 01:42:48.500]   They're in Poland. I don't know why in Poland. Why not?
[01:42:48.500 --> 01:42:54.260]   No, we're in Poland. I understand why because it needs to be done, but but where?
[01:42:54.260 --> 01:43:01.060]   Yes, we're at 5,000 square feet. I don't know. They just say, well, let me see. Can you read
[01:43:01.060 --> 01:43:04.980]   Polish? How's your Polish? Stephen Hackett. Stephen Hackett has built this.
[01:43:04.980 --> 01:43:08.100]   Yeah, the Apple Museum at the Norblin factory.
[01:43:08.100 --> 01:43:15.620]   Norblin. It's the Norblin factory complex in Warsaw.
[01:43:15.620 --> 01:43:22.820]   P.S. Shencoah. They say Warsaw. Okay, good enough. So they're going to have 3500 Apple.
[01:43:22.820 --> 01:43:27.700]   I'm sorry, 1500 Apple exhibits dedicated to developing an evolution of Apple products.
[01:43:27.700 --> 01:43:35.380]   I think Field Trip. Yeah. That's what I think. We'll do a special live show from there.
[01:43:35.380 --> 01:43:41.620]   It sounds really interesting because it's not just, hey, we went on eBay and we managed to find
[01:43:41.620 --> 01:43:46.420]   like an Apple 2GS that was clear. According to the release, they have a lot of prototypes.
[01:43:46.420 --> 01:43:49.460]   A lot of they're really getting into here is with the real history of the company,
[01:43:49.460 --> 01:43:56.660]   not just the mythology. I know that Apple famously, Steve Jobs famously doesn't care about Apple
[01:43:56.660 --> 01:44:04.660]   history to the extent of putting what is now like what a million dollar Apple 1 board in the trash
[01:44:04.660 --> 01:44:09.700]   outside of his office to clean things out. But this is this, when you have a company that has the
[01:44:09.700 --> 01:44:15.860]   sort of impact and reach as Apple, it's really, really valuable when those stories get told to
[01:44:15.860 --> 01:44:21.220]   the future engineers, future designers, and future cultural historians. So I'm glad that there's
[01:44:21.220 --> 01:44:26.820]   some interest in acquiring the stuff and making it available to not just tourists,
[01:44:26.820 --> 01:44:32.020]   but also researchers in the future. They will have not a real Apple 1, but a faithful replica of
[01:44:32.020 --> 01:44:38.820]   the first Apple 1. And it works and it's signed by Steve Wozniak, the motherboard in the manual.
[01:44:38.820 --> 01:44:43.860]   Oh, bless him. Yeah, that's cool. Models known for their interesting role in the technological
[01:44:43.860 --> 01:44:48.660]   race and development visitors gets known to devices notorious for failures. I guess they'll have the
[01:44:48.660 --> 01:44:55.060]   iPod high-fi there and prototypes that have not been put into mass protection. So the vast
[01:44:55.060 --> 01:45:00.500]   majority of them operational or are being restored visitors will be able to touch, test, and experience
[01:45:00.500 --> 01:45:08.340]   them under the watchful eye of a curator named Olga. Don't we? So don't mess with her. No, I know
[01:45:08.340 --> 01:45:12.740]   that round mouse is frustrating as hell, but it's an exhibit. Don't throw it against the wall, please.
[01:45:13.380 --> 01:45:19.780]   It's actually Red Guardian after the job and that was available. Yeah, it'll be watching you.
[01:45:19.780 --> 01:45:27.940]   I let me see. Is there anything else I wanted to get in here today? There are more
[01:45:27.940 --> 01:45:34.900]   rumors, of course, titanium will be the material I think for the iPhone 14. That's more than a year
[01:45:34.900 --> 01:45:42.660]   off. Yeah, who cares? Maybe we'll talk about that when it happens. I think that's pretty
[01:45:42.660 --> 01:45:49.220]   much everything. Have you been watching the Olympics? I'm not even aware of the way how to do that.
[01:45:49.220 --> 01:45:59.380]   Yeah, so there's two ways to watch it in 4K. If you are a Comcast subscriber and you have an
[01:45:59.380 --> 01:46:04.740]   Xfinity X1 box, which I used to have and they're terrible, I got rid of them, replaced them with
[01:46:04.740 --> 01:46:10.340]   Tivos, which leaves me out for that. But I did four years ago watch them on the next one and
[01:46:10.340 --> 01:46:14.740]   at the time it was over the top and it was very stuttery. It was not an even though I had a good
[01:46:14.740 --> 01:46:20.900]   bandwidth. It was not a good experience. Now, if you don't mind paying an additional $20 a month
[01:46:20.900 --> 01:46:26.740]   for your already expensive YouTube TV subscription, which is $65 a month, you can get YouTube TV in
[01:46:26.740 --> 01:46:33.540]   4K. And I have been watching the Olympics in 4K HDR and it looks pretty good, although I was a
[01:46:33.540 --> 01:46:39.140]   little disappointed to find out that in many cases they're upscale 1080p cameras. But when it
[01:46:39.140 --> 01:46:43.940]   is good, it looks really good. They're also downscaling the backhaul. So it's going down to 1080p and
[01:46:43.940 --> 01:46:49.460]   then back up to 4K. Oh, is that what it is? Oh, that's crazy. That's crazy. Some of it is an 8K.
[01:46:49.460 --> 01:46:54.900]   If you live in Japan, you can go and watch it with 22 speakers surround sound and 8K video.
[01:46:54.900 --> 01:46:59.060]   Yeah, it's supposed to be pretty slick. It's an interesting subject because a lot of the
[01:46:59.060 --> 01:47:02.660]   cameras, a lot of the movies that we're watching in 4K aren't shot in 4K. They were all shot on
[01:47:02.660 --> 01:47:08.980]   aerial exa cameras that were 2K. They're all up. Some of them are all depends. Yeah, some are
[01:47:08.980 --> 01:47:13.940]   4K. I mean, some of the the areas can can do that. So it just depends on what they were shot on.
[01:47:13.940 --> 01:47:21.540]   Apple's quarterly results coming out. Is it later today? They're coming out soon. I think it's
[01:47:21.540 --> 01:47:27.540]   29th. Okay. I think it's two days for tomorrow. It's on Thursday. So we will be talking about that
[01:47:27.540 --> 01:47:31.700]   on next week. What do you think? You think they're gonna make money this year? I think they made
[01:47:31.700 --> 01:47:35.140]   some money. I think they didn't. I don't think they're gonna have to close. I don't think they're
[01:47:35.140 --> 01:47:40.580]   gonna say like August to the end. Okay. Yeah. This is today. I should go to Tech meme. They have
[01:47:40.580 --> 01:47:44.900]   the list of all the I want to see if Tim Clark swings back at Elon Musk. Is he gonna
[01:47:44.900 --> 01:47:49.780]   is he gonna? Oh, this is gonna be a big day. Today we get Apple, Google, Microsoft and AMD.
[01:47:49.780 --> 01:47:53.620]   All of them announcing their quarterly results.
[01:47:55.140 --> 01:47:59.460]   And of course, stock price is down on all four because you want to
[01:47:59.460 --> 01:48:04.900]   what is it? You sell you buy on the rumor cell in the news. So they should be. I don't know what's
[01:48:04.900 --> 01:48:11.780]   going on. Wait and find out Apple and Microsoft sell off right now before their earnings come out.
[01:48:11.780 --> 01:48:19.620]   Google too. Pretty big sell off. Not that I pay any attention to that. It just gives me FOMO.
[01:48:21.460 --> 01:48:26.180]   All right. Let's get our picks of the week in the next on the show.
[01:48:26.180 --> 01:48:32.260]   Start the picks of the week this week. I'll go this week. I'll go from left to right. Start with
[01:48:32.260 --> 01:48:40.180]   Renee Richie. So my pick is Mark has Brownlee who we were talking about earlier has started a new
[01:48:40.180 --> 01:48:44.260]   YouTube channel. You know, some people have many, many YouTube channels. Mark has metoriously has
[01:48:44.260 --> 01:48:50.500]   had just one for a very long time. And it's called the studio and it's for all the sort of behind the
[01:48:50.500 --> 01:48:56.100]   scenes and gear and everything else he's using. He started off with a 30 minute video that just
[01:48:56.100 --> 01:49:01.140]   is the studio tour, including the robot arms, including the top down. There's more red
[01:49:01.140 --> 01:49:05.220]   monstro sensors in this and I think in the red cupboards back at the factory. But it's just,
[01:49:05.220 --> 01:49:10.180]   it's really cool to watch. And he's really grown the team. Like he got David,
[01:49:10.180 --> 01:49:16.740]   say his last name wrong from Android authority police. Really amazing. You too,
[01:49:16.740 --> 01:49:21.940]   Brigot Hayado Huffman from Android Central, another really, really great YouTube person.
[01:49:21.940 --> 01:49:26.260]   They're working on production. He's got a podcast team. He's got researchers now. He's got
[01:49:26.260 --> 01:49:33.140]   motion graphics people. There's all of them with 168. He's got one of the new Mac Pro cubes back
[01:49:33.140 --> 01:49:38.980]   cheese graders back there. I see. They've got so many like half his desks have the Mac pros on
[01:49:38.980 --> 01:49:44.500]   them with like 368 gigabytes of RAM. The other half have iMac pros. It's just the amount of
[01:49:44.500 --> 01:49:48.500]   technology in that place. He's got all the power coming down from the lights
[01:49:48.500 --> 01:49:52.180]   into the middle of the rooms. There's no cords on the floors. It's got carpeting. He's got
[01:49:52.180 --> 01:49:57.140]   ceiling, but just looking at how they've got everything set up and they have a dedicated room
[01:49:57.140 --> 01:50:02.260]   for top downs, a dedicated two dedicated rooms for sets, one with white walls, one with gray walls,
[01:50:02.260 --> 01:50:05.860]   because as Alex Lindsay will tell you, you got to have that interface gray room for a lot of
[01:50:05.860 --> 01:50:12.260]   your productions, a whole robot room room just for the robot. And it's really fascinating to watch.
[01:50:12.260 --> 01:50:18.020]   And he's promising a lot more sort of behind the scenes, how they do that sort of videos to come,
[01:50:18.020 --> 01:50:21.380]   which I'm really interested because he's got some really talented people. He's always had
[01:50:21.380 --> 01:50:24.900]   talent to be working with them, but he's really expanded that team lately. Just a word to the
[01:50:24.900 --> 01:50:32.500]   wise, Marques, don't spend all your profits on your studio. I spent all of our profits on this
[01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:40.500]   table that can go up and down. And now I wish I had that money back. So just it's a really nice
[01:50:40.500 --> 01:50:44.020]   table, though, Leo. It's a good table, but I'm just saying, you know,
[01:50:44.020 --> 01:50:51.060]   Oh, talk about FOMO. Wow. Look at that. That's beautiful. I will not be watching the rest of
[01:50:51.060 --> 01:50:58.420]   this video. I can promise you that. Nothing like launching launching your first video in 19 hours
[01:50:58.420 --> 01:51:04.100]   and having 183,000 followers. No kidding. No kidding. People love my question.
[01:51:04.100 --> 01:51:08.980]   I also joke that like, I got to joke that he was, I think using the Mac Pro to use Google Docs.
[01:51:08.980 --> 01:51:14.180]   And it was the only way to get it not to spin up the fans. I want to see the robots. Does he
[01:51:14.180 --> 01:51:18.100]   does he? Yeah, I think the robot somewhere in the middle. That's another one of the rooms.
[01:51:18.100 --> 01:51:22.900]   Look at the Lord. The robot. He copied that from Apple Park. He said Apple Park has a few rooms
[01:51:22.900 --> 01:51:26.740]   that have map boxes on the ceiling. So that is just soft light everywhere. And he tried to copy
[01:51:26.740 --> 01:51:32.500]   that with D 300. Yeah, I don't know. I think about that. I wonder, I wonder what his long-term
[01:51:32.500 --> 01:51:38.260]   goal is. Does he want to take over from NBC or what? I mean, good Lord. I don't know. I wonder if
[01:51:38.260 --> 01:51:42.980]   maybe Netflix, who knows? Yeah, there's the robot. There's a robot. Oh, yeah. Look at that.
[01:51:42.980 --> 01:51:52.180]   Very cool. And apparently a lot of pets in there. Just one Mac. Yeah. You just train them. That's all.
[01:51:52.180 --> 01:51:56.980]   That's the iPhone prototype or the iPhone dummy. Right. We're filming for the video. Wow. Look at that.
[01:51:56.980 --> 01:52:01.220]   And of course, on a green screen because why not?
[01:52:04.340 --> 01:52:12.020]   That is if you want to do that, that is YouTube.com/... Well, I don't know. It's called the studio.
[01:52:12.020 --> 01:52:19.380]   Search for the studio on YouTube studio. The team at MKBHD. Andy and I go pick of the week.
[01:52:19.380 --> 01:52:26.340]   I have two picks. Both of them are things that you can buy sight unseen. But if you're
[01:52:26.340 --> 01:52:30.020]   interested in them, you might like to have this opportunity to buy them sight and seen before
[01:52:30.020 --> 01:52:37.700]   you can't buy them. First of all, Best Buy is having a deal on the iPad Pro 12.9 inch
[01:52:37.700 --> 01:52:44.580]   magic keyboard. Not the current version that costs $350, but the version that's for last year's
[01:52:44.580 --> 01:52:48.660]   model. Oh, but it fits perfectly. I've been using my last-time model on the 2021.
[01:52:48.660 --> 01:52:55.860]   Yeah. The only difference is that the 2021 iPad Pro like mine is half a millimeter thicker
[01:52:55.860 --> 01:53:01.300]   and it's a little bit heavier. But the difference here is that they're selling these for $199.
[01:53:01.300 --> 01:53:08.740]   Oh, wow. $150. Nice. So I went and ordered one yesterday for sure because to me, that was the
[01:53:08.740 --> 01:53:14.420]   right price for any type of a keyboard add-on for it. I was not going to spend $350 for no
[01:53:14.420 --> 01:53:20.420]   matter how well Apple engineered it was. So I came across this yesterday. It's still active today
[01:53:20.420 --> 01:53:24.660]   on Tuesday. So hopefully by the time people listen to this, this might still be going on.
[01:53:24.660 --> 01:53:30.900]   I also heard people saying that they even found some at Walmart at $150. So
[01:53:30.900 --> 01:53:36.660]   wow. Keep your eyes open. But $200 was enough for me. You can return it within two weeks. So if
[01:53:36.660 --> 01:53:40.420]   you find out that it doesn't work the way that you were hoping it to, you're not out that much
[01:53:40.420 --> 01:53:44.900]   money. But the other piece of news is that we've been talking about the Playdate,
[01:53:44.900 --> 01:53:52.980]   handheld game console, a handheld game system for a while now. And they finally announced a,
[01:53:52.980 --> 01:53:59.220]   they finally announced the pre-order date. It goes on pre-order on this Thursday,
[01:53:59.220 --> 01:54:05.940]   on the 29th, I believe this is the actual date for at 1 p.m. Eastern Time, $189. I think it's
[01:54:05.940 --> 01:54:12.020]   another $30 if you want this, the cool snap-on cover. And this is another one where it's like,
[01:54:12.020 --> 01:54:18.900]   oh, I was kind of sorry that I bought the $200 iPad keyboard, despite the great deal. I'm like,
[01:54:18.900 --> 01:54:22.980]   I was kind of hoping I could buy this anyway, because it looks like the sort of game console
[01:54:22.980 --> 01:54:28.340]   that I'm kind of interested in doesn't ship until the end of the year. Also, they've said,
[01:54:28.340 --> 01:54:35.700]   panic, they've said that they anticipate being able to fill all orders. It just depends on
[01:54:35.700 --> 01:54:40.100]   how long it's going to go. I've also read that it's not going to be the sort of thing where,
[01:54:40.100 --> 01:54:46.180]   oh, if you're not there by 101 minute past one, you won't be able to place an order, you'll be able
[01:54:46.180 --> 01:54:50.980]   to place an order, you'll just have a position in line for the thing. So don't feel as though
[01:54:50.980 --> 01:54:57.380]   you got this one chance and then if you're out, you're out. But yeah, it seems like the sort of
[01:54:57.380 --> 01:55:03.300]   stuff that I want to take a gamble on, because it was a great idea two years ago, and the more
[01:55:03.300 --> 01:55:07.380]   information they come out with, particularly last month just got me more excited about just this
[01:55:07.380 --> 01:55:12.420]   little cute little handheld, quirky little handheld that has a subscription service for games where
[01:55:12.420 --> 01:55:17.060]   you just, games just magically appear on it. You don't know what's coming, but you have an idea
[01:55:17.060 --> 01:55:22.500]   that because it's a, it was designed for this weird device, it will have attracted weird enough
[01:55:22.500 --> 01:55:27.540]   developers that they're going to be interesting. Yeah, I like seeing this that you'll be able to
[01:55:27.540 --> 01:55:33.300]   develop for it. They're going to offer a free SDK and you can sideload games onto the playdate.
[01:55:33.300 --> 01:55:39.140]   And it basically it's a web, their web browser games. So that's pretty interesting. I think that's
[01:55:39.140 --> 01:55:42.980]   pretty exciting. Yeah, they've also, if you're, and if you're curious, they did put some hardware
[01:55:42.980 --> 01:55:48.260]   in the hands of a few select people. I saw some reviews. Yeah. Yeah. I think that they were barred
[01:55:48.260 --> 01:55:53.780]   from reviewing like the games that they, that the sample devices had, and there was, it was the
[01:55:53.780 --> 01:55:59.060]   intention was to take a look at the hardware. And a lot of the initial worries like, Oh, well,
[01:55:59.060 --> 01:56:03.140]   Jesus, not a backlit display and almost everyone's saying, no, that's not an issue. As long as there's
[01:56:03.140 --> 01:56:08.980]   any light whatsoever, it's good that it feels good in the hand. It's a very good experience.
[01:56:08.980 --> 01:56:15.300]   So I'm, I want this stereo dock that looks really cool. Then it's a little robot on your desk.
[01:56:15.300 --> 01:56:17.540]   So cute. That's so cute. And it comes with a pen.
[01:56:17.540 --> 01:56:28.580]   It's right out of Bloom County. That is, you're right. That is cute. Yeah. That is really cute.
[01:56:28.580 --> 01:56:34.020]   All right. So playdate is at play.date. And it's from our good friends at Panic Software who do
[01:56:34.020 --> 01:56:39.860]   so much great Mac software. So I like to support them as well. Alex Lindsey, your pick of the week.
[01:56:39.860 --> 01:56:47.540]   My mom got me a birthday present and I had put this off forever. And I actually really like it.
[01:56:47.540 --> 01:56:51.620]   This is, I knew I would. This is the Ember. I think this is the 14 ounce Ember.
[01:56:51.620 --> 01:56:57.460]   And what this does, of course, is it's got a little, it's got a little platform. When you put
[01:56:57.460 --> 01:57:04.740]   it on there, it charges a little USB mug. And your phone can talk to it and set the temperature.
[01:57:04.740 --> 01:57:10.260]   So I have it set at the maximum, which is like 145 or whatever. But I can put coffee in here and
[01:57:10.260 --> 01:57:15.380]   just let it sit. And I can work my way through it and warm the whole time.
[01:57:15.380 --> 01:57:21.060]   I have mine right here. I think I have the same one as you do. This is the little charger plate
[01:57:21.060 --> 01:57:27.060]   and it plugs in and it works very stuffy kind of. And I'm always surprised because I'll be sitting
[01:57:27.060 --> 01:57:30.420]   because on office hours, you know, I'm there for hours and I'm always surprised that I'll be like
[01:57:30.420 --> 01:57:33.540]   halfway through an hour and I look down and I pick it up and I'm like, oh, it's still warm.
[01:57:33.540 --> 01:57:38.500]   Oh, it's still warm. Well, that's the other thing. It has a battery. So it has a battery. So you
[01:57:38.500 --> 01:57:43.700]   don't have to have it. I have the pliers in my desk so that it'll just last all day. But you can
[01:57:43.700 --> 01:57:48.580]   totally walk around for, you know, I don't know how many hours, but you can keep it there. I've even
[01:57:48.580 --> 01:57:56.820]   my wife has got one and sometimes I take hers. And so if I'm on a really long show, I can,
[01:57:56.820 --> 01:58:01.060]   I can go for it. I can finish one and just pick up the other one. Another cup, please. Yeah,
[01:58:01.060 --> 01:58:05.460]   exactly. So I don't think you can put the cup in the dishwasher though, right? You probably have
[01:58:05.460 --> 01:58:10.660]   to hand wash that I would guess. I have a little funny about that. I don't, I wash my
[01:58:10.660 --> 01:58:16.980]   stuff. I drink out of my hands. I'm really touched. Anyway, you don't want to dish wash my cups.
[01:58:16.980 --> 01:58:22.580]   No, but it's really good. Also, just a quick reminder, it's not really a pick, but it potentially
[01:58:22.580 --> 01:58:30.580]   is a pick next week or some week in the future is Blackmagic has a special 10 o'clock on Thursday.
[01:58:30.580 --> 01:58:35.860]   And we'll probably do some have a sure option. Sarah's will stream along. Yeah.
[01:58:35.860 --> 01:58:38.980]   Yeah. And what do you think? What will they announce cameras?
[01:58:38.980 --> 01:58:46.580]   We, a lot of us think it'll be an 8K camera because they already did the 12K camera. So they
[01:58:46.580 --> 01:58:50.100]   somehow like missed it. Like they missed the turn. You know, like, oh, let's go to 12 and we're like,
[01:58:50.100 --> 01:58:54.900]   okay, it'll be really good to have an eight. So we think that there's an 8K camera. We also think,
[01:58:54.900 --> 01:59:00.660]   and we have no inside information. Like we have no idea what's happening. So, and we've been wrong,
[01:59:00.660 --> 01:59:07.380]   at least when they, so we, so our guess is is that 8K camera, probably a refresh of all the
[01:59:07.380 --> 01:59:13.380]   switchers between the minis and the constellation. All those switchers are old. They have old chips,
[01:59:13.380 --> 01:59:18.180]   old processing. They don't do all the things that the new ones do. And so we think that that would
[01:59:18.180 --> 01:59:23.220]   unify the entire pipeline there. Might see more AK because it's during the Olympics and the Olympics
[01:59:23.220 --> 01:59:27.060]   is going a lot of 8K. We kind of feel like there could be some more 8K stuff there. One thing to
[01:59:27.060 --> 01:59:31.620]   notice is that what we notice that the Black magic is now advertising the mini. They're little,
[01:59:31.620 --> 01:59:37.380]   they're little mini in Time Magazine. Wow. And, and National Geographic.
[01:59:37.380 --> 01:59:43.380]   That just shows you two things. One how popular they are, but also how broad the range of
[01:59:43.380 --> 01:59:50.340]   commute creators is. Like everybody is a creator all of a sudden. And just that, that, that, that
[01:59:50.340 --> 01:59:56.180]   pyramid of who's, who's getting into this is just going super wide. Well, and Black magic has a lot
[01:59:56.180 --> 02:00:01.940]   to do with that because they're very affordable. Well, that, you know, in, you know, the halls in
[02:00:01.940 --> 02:00:08.260]   at Las Vegas Convention Center. So, for NAB in October, everyone's been talking about the fact that
[02:00:08.260 --> 02:00:14.660]   Black magic has half of the North Hall. What? Half. They don't, I don't even know what to do with it.
[02:00:14.660 --> 02:00:20.660]   That's got to be 100,000 square feet. That's huge. I think it's, I think it's more. Oh my God.
[02:00:20.660 --> 02:00:26.340]   100,000 square feet. I think I heard someone say it was like 180,000 square feet. Oh my God.
[02:00:26.340 --> 02:00:32.420]   Space. Yeah. So they, I don't know what they're doing with it, but they have half of the North
[02:00:32.420 --> 02:00:36.500]   Hall. Clearly they're a successful enterprise. That's great. They're doing okay. Almost as
[02:00:36.500 --> 02:00:40.900]   successful as Marques Brownlee. That's pretty good. Yeah. They might, they might be all
[02:00:40.900 --> 02:00:46.260]   kids will get the other half. Yeah. Yeah. What's crazy is a company that big that's privately held,
[02:00:46.260 --> 02:00:51.220]   you know, like it's for them. It's just Grant and a thousand. What's the story? It's just some guy
[02:00:51.220 --> 02:00:58.020]   came up with it. Oh, there's such a, such a long story there. It'd be good to do it. You should
[02:00:58.020 --> 02:01:01.140]   do a triangulation with Grant. That's what you should. Oh, it loves you. It'd be really fun. That
[02:01:01.140 --> 02:01:04.980]   would be really fun. The, the, you know, he, I don't know, I don't, I'm not going to try to
[02:01:04.980 --> 02:01:10.180]   reproduce the whole story, but he's worked in board development and for other people before he
[02:01:10.180 --> 02:01:15.060]   did black magic and finally started doing his own thing. Just got frustrated and started doing
[02:01:15.060 --> 02:01:19.460]   his own thing. And first came out as just inexpensive capture boards that were being
[02:01:19.460 --> 02:01:25.700]   OEMed by A.J.A. and then, then he did that. And then, and then he slowly just kept on, you know,
[02:01:25.700 --> 02:01:30.980]   it went from boards to. His timing is perfect because of course, not only is there suddenly
[02:01:30.980 --> 02:01:36.020]   a huge audience for his stuff, but the technology has really moved along very rapidly in the last
[02:01:36.020 --> 02:01:40.500]   few years. And he's been able to finish that. What's really interesting is how many companies
[02:01:40.500 --> 02:01:49.620]   are doing video in Australia. You have Atomos, you have, say, Atomos, Blackmagic, VMix, you know,
[02:01:49.620 --> 02:01:54.980]   like there's all these companies that, that come out of, that come out of Australia. And we think
[02:01:54.980 --> 02:01:59.940]   it's all really, I think it's all related to J-Car. J-Car is the radio shack of, of, uh,
[02:01:59.940 --> 02:02:03.540]   so you had a lot of kids learning this stuff, soldering, and working. I feel like it must be
[02:02:03.540 --> 02:02:08.100]   because it's just, it's just like a, it is, because J-Car, you know, I thought, I went to a J-Car in
[02:02:08.100 --> 02:02:12.340]   Melbourne and, um, uh, I thought this is the most amazing store I've ever been in. You know,
[02:02:12.340 --> 02:02:16.500]   it's like radio, what's radio, what, it's what radio shack should have been. That's awesome. And
[02:02:16.500 --> 02:02:22.900]   then I found out there's like 200 of them in, in, in Australia. I pay your right. I pay your right.
[02:02:22.900 --> 02:02:27.620]   That would be a really interesting thing to study. Yeah, it's really interesting. I'm, I'm just
[02:02:27.620 --> 02:02:31.140]   waiting. I feel like now we have to persuade them to come to the United States and just
[02:02:31.140 --> 02:02:35.380]   buy all the old, just take over all the old radio shack things. Yeah, that's the way to do it.
[02:02:35.380 --> 02:02:42.900]   Guys, you are fantastic. Thank you so much for being here. And I'm not just talking to the panel.
[02:02:42.900 --> 02:02:47.060]   Of course, Alex, Lindsey, and Renee, Richie, and Andy, and Akka, but also to all of you who
[02:02:47.060 --> 02:02:54.260]   listen and watch every week, we can't thank you enough for being loyal listeners to Mac Break Weekly.
[02:02:54.260 --> 02:03:00.580]   If you want to support us just a little bit more, you know, advertising sales have been down quite
[02:03:00.580 --> 02:03:04.980]   a bit since COVID and we'd like to do more, for instance, like to do more triangulations.
[02:03:04.980 --> 02:03:12.100]   There's a way to do that with Club Tuit. You can join Club Tuit by going to twit.tv/clubtuit.
[02:03:12.100 --> 02:03:16.980]   Seven dollars a month. That's it. There's no yearly. There's no, that's just one thing. Seven
[02:03:16.980 --> 02:03:22.900]   dollars a month, month to month. No contract involved. What do you get? You get, of course,
[02:03:22.900 --> 02:03:28.820]   besides the glow inside knowing you're supporting us. You also get ad-free versions of everything we
[02:03:28.820 --> 02:03:34.660]   do. Although apparently an ad snuck in to a Sunday's twit. We're taking it out now. I apologize. A
[02:03:34.660 --> 02:03:40.100]   number of people said, "Oh, it's so nice to hear an ad." So sometimes people miss the ads, but if you
[02:03:40.100 --> 02:03:47.460]   don't, ad-free versions of all of our shows, audio and video, there's also the TwiP+ Feed, which has
[02:03:47.460 --> 02:03:53.140]   a lot of stuff from beginnings. Like I suspect today's pre-show conversation will make its way
[02:03:53.140 --> 02:03:59.700]   into the TwiP+ Feed because that was pretty interesting. Stuff that didn't make it the regular
[02:03:59.700 --> 02:04:05.380]   podcast and then our fabulous Discord, which has turned out for me to be one of the best parts
[02:04:05.380 --> 02:04:11.860]   of the whole thing. I just really love the Discord. It is a chat server. We've always had IRC. We'll
[02:04:11.860 --> 02:04:16.500]   always have IRC as a free and open chat server, but Discord is all the rage these days we're able to
[02:04:16.500 --> 02:04:24.660]   create. Live stages where people can ask questions. Every show has its own chat, but there's also,
[02:04:24.660 --> 02:04:30.340]   it's a place where really nice, interesting people get together to talk about all this stuff.
[02:04:30.340 --> 02:04:34.900]   We geeky enthusiasts are into between anime and autos and books and coding,
[02:04:34.900 --> 02:04:41.300]   all the way to movies and philosophy and photography, space, travel and more. If you want to know more,
[02:04:42.180 --> 02:04:49.220]   again, I think it's well worth the $7. I really appreciate it. Thank you in advance. Go to twit.tv/club
[02:04:49.220 --> 02:04:56.020]   Twit. If you're in the Discord and you complain about my hosting abilities, I may actually respond.
[02:04:56.020 --> 02:05:04.100]   Oh dear. Do you respond nicely? I'm sure. No, mo, mo, mo. I just explained what it's like on the
[02:05:04.100 --> 02:05:09.860]   website. Oh, actually I did see that. Yeah, it's challenging. You can't see it. Leo makes it look
[02:05:09.860 --> 02:05:14.180]   a lot easier than it is. No, I don't. But you still thank you. You do. Thank you.
[02:05:14.180 --> 02:05:19.620]   Yeah, I think the Discord is really turn. You have a Discord, of course, for office hours.
[02:05:19.620 --> 02:05:24.820]   And I think I really like this. I think it's an interesting medium. I really like Discord a lot,
[02:05:24.820 --> 02:05:31.460]   really having fun with it. It's great. It's the backbone of what we do on office hours.
[02:05:31.460 --> 02:05:36.340]   Yeah, it's great. We also, for people, and you don't have to be in the club to do this,
[02:05:36.340 --> 02:05:41.860]   but for people who like to travel, we feel like travel's coming back. Lisa's put together a
[02:05:41.860 --> 02:05:47.300]   Alaska cruise for the Twit family. Next year, don't worry. We're not going this year. It'll be
[02:05:47.300 --> 02:05:54.100]   July of 2022. If you want to know more about that, cruised.twit.tv, I would not wait too long. I
[02:05:54.100 --> 02:06:00.020]   know it's a long time, you know, it's a year from now, exactly a year from now. But we haven't
[02:06:00.020 --> 02:06:03.940]   asked that Paul Therat will be joining us, which is great. Paul and his wife, Stephanie and Lisa
[02:06:03.940 --> 02:06:09.060]   and I will be on it. We're going to have some fun events. And I know it's hard sometimes to plan
[02:06:09.060 --> 02:06:13.860]   that far in advance. But I have a feeling that we are going to be out of rooms pretty quickly now
[02:06:13.860 --> 02:06:23.140]   because the cruise industry is seeing incredible response. So do not delay. Go to cruised.twit.tv
[02:06:23.140 --> 02:06:27.700]   if you're interested. We'd love to see you. There'll be a lot of fun. Polar Bear is not included.
[02:06:28.660 --> 02:06:34.420]   Thank you everybody for joining us. Mac Break Weekly is a production every Tuesday 11 a.m. Pacific
[02:06:34.420 --> 02:06:41.620]   is when we try to begin 2 p.m. Eastern time, 1800 UTC. You can watch us do it live. You know,

[02:07:00.100 --> 02:07:07.140]   website, twit.tv/mbw. While you're there, you'll note there's a link to our YouTube channel. There's
[02:07:07.140 --> 02:07:12.820]   a dedicated channel for Mac Break Weekly and a link to some of the big podcast clients
[02:07:12.820 --> 02:07:17.140]   to make that a little bit easy. But of course you can subscribe in any podcast client. If yours
[02:07:17.140 --> 02:07:22.500]   supports ratings or reviews, please give us a five star review. It would really help us spread
[02:07:22.500 --> 02:07:26.900]   the word about Mac Break Weekly. We think everybody who loves apples should be listening.
[02:07:26.900 --> 02:07:32.420]   And of course, if you subscribe that way, you'll get it automatically, which is a nice thing too.
[02:07:32.420 --> 02:07:36.500]   Thanks everybody for being here. Now back to work because break time is over.
