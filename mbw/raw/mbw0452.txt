[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.720]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show where we cover the latest Apple news.
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.280]   Look who's here, Adam Christiansen from Maccuss.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.240]   >> Hey, how you doing?
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.040]   >> Hey Adam.
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.720]   Good to see you again.
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.640]   It's been way too long.
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.920]   >> I know, I can't believe it.
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.680]   Well, I'm glad to get you back.
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.440]   >> Yeah, thanks for having me.
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.840]   >> Things going well.
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.440]   >> Everything's going very well, yeah.
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.800]   >> Good.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:09.240]   Well, I'm sure that there'll be a little bit of talk of something having to do with Apple today, so.
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.840]   >> There's a few things going on in the Apple world.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.920]   >> You should sit right in.
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:12.840]   >> Yeah.
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.200]   >> Also with us, Mr. Renee Ritchie from iMore.com.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.560]   Good to see you.
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.360]   >> Talk louder, Leo.
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.240]   I'm listening on my watch.
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.880]   >> Yeah, hello.
[00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:22.880]   >> Hello.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:23.880]   >> Hello.
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:24.880]   >> What?
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.400]   I can't hear you.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.040]   >> And you not go from the Chicago Sun times.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.040]   >> Greetings, I'm wearing a watch that needs to be charged roughly once every two years.
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.800]   >> I can't handle them all.
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.280]   >> Yeah, I can beat that.
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.480]   I've got one of them solo charging watches.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.320]   I got to watch the charges just from walking around.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.920]   >> Mine charges on Pure Awesome.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.520]   >> Before we get to the watch, let's talk about results.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.560]   Early results were announced yesterday for the quarter ending in March, which is Apple's
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.440]   Q2, right?
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.440]   I think so.
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.640]   Hey, $13.6 billion profit.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.800]   >> That's Shabby.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.040]   What's that between friends, Leo?
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.800]   >> That's Shabby.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:12.040]   It only looks scant when compared to the previous quarter.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.400]   So wait a minute, do you mean that they, the fact they had that incredible quarter after
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.320]   releasing the two most exciting phones in the past three or four years, that wasn't
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.280]   the indication that that was going to be quarters like that forever.
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.160]   It is a whole compresses for the stock analysts.
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.080]   >> For Q2, it is kind of a quarter like that.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.520]   I mean, it is a massive increase of 32 percent increase.
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.520]   >> I think they're Q2.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.520]   This time was better than their holiday last year, I think.
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.520]   I have to double check that.
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.520]   >> Yeah, pretty remarkable.
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.520]   >> That's insane.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.520]   >> Pretty remarkable.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.000]   Gross margin, 40 percent.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   That's up.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.080]   They added, they increased their dividend and they bought back more stock, but you know,
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.160]   that's really more about the shareholders and about Apple's results.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.920]   What we care about is how Apple as a company is doing.
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.000]   And I guess the answer would be pretty darn good.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.040]   >> Can't hear you throw all the money, Leo.
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:09.040]   >> A lot of this because of China, apparently, they sold 61.2 million iPhones in the quarter.
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.760]   That's a little off the torrid pace of the Q4, which was 75 and a half million, but still,
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:15.760]   not Shabby.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.960]   Do you remember when we were wondering if they'd ever hit 10 million in a year?
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.000]   >> Not Shabby.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.720]   We're talking 135 million in six months.
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:27.720]   Unbelievable.
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.880]   And of course, a year ago, year to year is what you really compare quarter to quarter.
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.640]   And Q2 last year, 43.7 million iPhones.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.880]   So a significant, like 50 percent increase.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.200]   That's a new March quarter record.
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.480]   Max sales did well.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.880]   I always like max sales to do well because I kind of have a little bit of a thing for
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:46.880]   the Macintosh.
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.920]   4.5 million units sold.
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.720]   That's up from 4.1 a year ago.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.000]   iPad down 23 percent.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.400]   It's just failing slowly.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.240]   >> Well, still a hell of a tablet market.
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.640]   Only a million a week.
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.640]   Come on.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.400]   What kind of business is that?
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.920]   >> Also I would say that creatively, if there's one tablet that's really holding the vanguard
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.320]   of the future of 21st century computing, it is the iPad.
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:22.400]   Because both Apple and Microsoft are taking steps back and creating tablet-like devices
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.440]   that nonetheless run desktop operating systems and have those sort of limitations.
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.240]   Ross Apple is really the only one that's really pushing it forward to saying, "No, this is
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.960]   a legitimate computing device and we're going to continue to make it."
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.840]   It might be like their version of Google's internet base stations hovering in the air
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:39.920]   on healing and balloons.
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.440]   We don't care if there's no profit in this.
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.480]   This is a good idea and we're going to continue to make it a little kel-de-loft by the money
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.480]   that we're making off of the iPhone.
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.920]   >> Sweet had an interesting interpretation.
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.320]   So things iPad sales were down due to increasing Mac sales.
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.600]   I guess with the Mac book, you could say that.
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.960]   >> If iPhone 6 plus and it's the new old Macs, because it's hitting them on both ends.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.920]   >> Also on the Windows side of it, we're seeing now that Intel is finally shipping these
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:11.400]   really, really good and powerful mobility chips without that can serve desktop operating
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.000]   systems and also don't require a lot of heat.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.640]   A lot of people who might have been getting 9.7 inch iPads because it was the only way
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.840]   to get a really good light travel computer, now have a lot of other options that are a
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.360]   lot less trouble if you're not interested in being part of the future of computing.
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.400]   And then there's of course the pressure from larger sized phones, which are now pretty
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.880]   much stock and standard.
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.840]   So it's going to be interesting to see if Apple is content with the iPad.
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.920]   If you look at the lines on the graph for the Mac, it's pretty flat.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.920]   They're sort of bumping up and down.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:45.640]   It goes up and down, but it's pretty much consistent since 2012.
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.200]   And there's no chance of Apple ever canceling the Mac either.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.840]   It's possible that they could be just simply satisfied with that the iPad has found is
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.760]   going to find its natural level and it's still going to be worth being part of our product
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:56.760]   portfolio.
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:00.480]   >> One of the fact that I was considering that is if you look at the iPad Air 2, the
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.960]   processor in there is ridiculous.
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.720]   I think it's one of the first times you could look and say iOS is actually holding this
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.600]   device back.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.400]   So we're doing engineering and chip design now that I think frankly, shames broadwell
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.360]   in many ways, especially when you include the delays that Intel had bringing broadwell
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.360]   to market.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.280]   And when you fit and Apple's not slowing down, they're not a company that goes, "Ah, the
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.280]   A7 is fine.
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.920]   We'll keep that in tablets for three years.
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.080]   We'll get the most money."
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.440]   No, they're telling these guys to run as fast as they can.
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.680]   So when you see an A9 this year, it's going to be even better.
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.080]   And there are rumors that Apple is doing iPad Pro and that there might be something happening
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.920]   with iOS on the iPad specifically to address this.
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:38.080]   But I think that there's just too much, too many smart people who actually like the iPad
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:42.920]   working on it at Apple for it to stay a marginal device for very long.
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:46.800]   >> So somebody asked them this at the quarterly call and you listen to the call.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.640]   I know Renee.
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:53.840]   But this was the response and I don't know if it was Luca or Tim.
[00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.000]   Somebody said, "Follow up an iPad.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.040]   What will it take to re-accelerate iPads?"
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.040]   Are you seeing Tim?
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.440]   It was Tim answering this.
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.640]   Number one, we have to stop and this is interesting.
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.760]   Stop having the situations where we sell through more than we sell in.
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.600]   What does that mean, Renee?
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.880]   >> They had more channel inventory than they needed.
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.560]   I think they adjusted by a million units.
[00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.960]   >> He said inventory correction over over a million units.
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:14.960]   Have we cannibalization?
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:15.960]   Yes.
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:19.240]   Clearly seeing from my phone on the other side from the Mac, as I've said before, I've never
[00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:20.560]   worried about that.
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.240]   It is what it is.
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.880]   Tim is very Zen.
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.280]   It will stabilize.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:28.400]   Not sure precisely when, but I'm confident it will.
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:31.560]   IBM partnership is in its early stages in terms of bearing fruit here.
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.480]   That's the enterprise side of that.
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.320]   That could really be a change.
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.320]   >> That's another big deal.
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.720]   I think the biggest indication that Apple has predicts a long, long future for the iPad.
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:47.800]   As like Renee said, the iPad Air 2 is almost suspiciously overpowered for what it does
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:48.800]   right now.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:53.920]   You don't have to have a wild imagination to think, "Gee, I wonder what iOS 9 is going
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:58.480]   to do or I wonder what suite of apps they're predicting or they're already planning for
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:02.880]   that's going to require this much processing power and this much application RAM."
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:06.840]   >> It's going to have a very specific place in the mix.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:11.000]   I think that's a thing that a lot of people are glossing over.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.200]   It has its space.
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:15.200]   It's going to be in a smaller level than an iPhone.
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:19.360]   It's above where they're selling units of Macs.
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:23.520]   I think it's tapering out too because I think people are finding their place for it and
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:24.960]   their use case for it.
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:30.280]   Like myself, I've noticed since getting the larger screen iPhone, I am using my iPad a
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.680]   little bit less and I may not upgrade it every year but I'm going to continue to own
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:34.680]   an iPad.
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.200]   I think there's a lot of people in that space where they have that iPad.
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.440]   It's the thing that I grab when I'm going to sit down on the couch, when I'm going to
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.440]   relax.
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:43.760]   It's the thing that I grab when I'm going to go to the coffee shop and I don't want to
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.000]   drag my MacBook Pro along.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.760]   I don't think it's going away but I think it's just not going to be rolling in those
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.280]   huge numbers like it did when it first was released.
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:58.960]   It's still a significant product and Apple's lineup and will continue to be for a long time.
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:03.600]   Tim also said that the data makes them feel better than the sales do.
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:11.440]   First time buyer rates that is people buying their first iPad, 40% in the US but 70% in
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.440]   China.
[00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:16.760]   China really is the bright spot for both the iPhone and even the iPad.
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:21.760]   He says those aren't numbers you'd get if the market were saturated.
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:25.720]   He says I don't think that the theory of saturation is correct.
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:28.320]   We also say usage numbers off the charts.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.520]   In other words, people really are using it.
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:34.200]   Customer satisfaction at or near to 100%.
[00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.040]   Those numbers along with intent to buy everything looks fantastic.
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.920]   E-commerce numbers.
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:43.560]   I'm reading the Mac rumors sketchy little transcription here.
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:47.360]   My belief is that as inventory plays out, as we make some continued investments in our
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.320]   product pipeline that we're doing, we have planned for some time inventory playing out
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.200]   enterprise taking over.
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.120]   The iPad is still an extremely good business in the long term.
[00:10:56.120 --> 00:11:01.040]   When it begins to grow again, I won't predict, but I do think it will assist him cook.
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:06.160]   Maybe with a 12-inch pressure sensitive iPad, maybe that's...
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.160]   Force touch.
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:13.640]   Is the Mac book the 12-inch that they were talking about or is this something separate?
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:16.760]   No, definitely something separate.
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:21.120]   As I say, it's an interesting product to me because just like Microsoft Surface 3, not
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:25.520]   the Surface Pro 3, but the new Surface 3, it does indicate that it makes...
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:29.320]   Rasa, when the iPad first came out, I really did see that this is finally we're breaking
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.720]   free of the idea of a keyboard connected to a screen by a hinge.
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.600]   This really is the future of computing.
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.960]   It does seem that both of these products is sort of a step back saying, "No, we just
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:41.960]   want a super, super ultra light notebook that says light is an iPad with a battery life
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:45.800]   like an iPad, but people seem to want a desktop operating system."
[00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:48.520]   But there's plenty of room for the iPad to continue to make new stuff.
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:52.240]   It's interesting to think about what they would do with a 12-inch iPad now that they
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:57.240]   have this 12-inch MacBook that is so wonderful in so many ways.
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:01.600]   If they're going for pro users, it's going to be interesting to hear them tell the story
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:08.200]   of why someone wants to have a 12-inch iOS device instead of a 12-inch Mac OS device.
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:14.120]   Oivee says in the chatroom, "It's going to take an iOS, big iOS improvement update
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.720]   to move iPad sales."
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:19.760]   And others, what we've been saying, maybe a hardware update, it's clear that the iPad
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.400]   as it stands is just going to chug along.
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.920]   If it's going to come back, it's going to have to be kicked by something.
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.480]   Also, it's acceleration curve.
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:31.080]   If you look at it, it is still sold more units in a shorter amount of time than the iPhone
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.200]   has and the iPhone has a massively successful business.
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:36.080]   It only looks so small compared to the iPhone.
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.520]   Acceleration is insane.
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.840]   When you have an acceleration that fast and have used this analogy before, there's 100
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:45.560]   miles an hour speed limit on a highway and you're in a Lamborghini and you're in a Toyota,
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:48.400]   your acceleration is usually different, but your top speed is still the same.
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.120]   So the iPad got there very, very quickly.
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.880]   And now you're seeing the result of that quarter after quarter.
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.920]   It's pretty much at top speed right now.
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:00.680]   Of course, China was big because it was Chinese New Year, which I don't know, but I gather
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:01.920]   is a big buying.
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:05.000]   It's kind of like the equivalent of our Christmas in a way.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   You get a red envelope in the middle.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.400]   So they set a record for revenue in China.
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:11.400]   I didn't know this.
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:19.360]   There are already 21 Apple stores in China on their way to 40 stores by next year.
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.280]   That's kind of amazing.
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:27.400]   And the Chinese sales up 71% year over year.
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:35.240]   So in China, huge quarter, primarily led by iPhone, Mac unit sales in China, though up
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:36.480]   31% as well.
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.800]   That's kind of surprising.
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:41.520]   The Chinese, I think, said we aren't going to buy any more Windows machines.
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.800]   Maybe that means we're going to buy Macs.
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.600]   Tim pointed out too, and I didn't know this.
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:52.000]   I'm not that up on China, but he also mentioned there is a large growing middle class in China,
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.480]   and that seems to be benefiting Apple.
[00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:59.360]   And developers in China are doing, OK, Apple says they've paid $5 billion now to developers
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:03.200]   in China for Chinese apps.
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.160]   So a really strong quarter.
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:11.440]   So it was clear when Apple launched their China strategy and it started seeing slides
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:16.200]   about China and why, and various China social networks at the keynotes.
[00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:19.520]   It was clear Apple knew that this was an important market that others do too.
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:22.320]   It's a giant market relatively untapped.
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:27.040]   And one way to respond to saturation in the West is to say, well, we got a brand new market
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:30.160]   here with more than a billion customers.
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.720]   And it's proven true.
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.680]   Not so much for PCs.
[00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:39.480]   A little less for Android, but absolutely for iOS and Mac.
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.680]   Revenue, just phenomenal.
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:44.680]   If you look at the pie chart, this is again from Mac.
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:48.480]   What do you think the red thing is?
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.480]   Money.
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.920]   iPhone sales.
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.200]   That's the red one.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:56.120]   Mac sales, the next biggest, that's blue, 10%.
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:58.840]   So iPhone sales, 69% of revenue.
[00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.640]   Mac sales, nice 10% of revenue.
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.080]   I'm happy with that.
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.480]   This is 9%.
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.680]   iPad sales 9%.
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.440]   It was that line from Tim Cook where he said we're still generating money and excessive
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:10.520]   our ability to spend it.
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:11.520]   Did he say that?
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:12.520]   It was something close to that.
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:13.520]   I forget the exact thing.
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:14.720]   Nice feeling, isn't it?
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.360]   More money than they need to operate the business.
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.440]   Isn't that a good feeling?
[00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:21.200]   Those cash reserves going up, up, up.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:23.040]   You want to catch that?
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.040]   Beautiful new money.
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:27.720]   Caltech has developed a nanotechnology for creating a violin small enough to play the
[00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:30.520]   song to make people feel sorry for Tim Cook and his money.
[00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:33.520]   Did he say anything about the watch?
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:38.280]   It's too early because it went on pre-order at the end of the quarter and they also said
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:41.240]   they're not going to break it out for the foreseeable future.
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:44.120]   The analysts tried almost every slight of tongue that could put the probably numbers
[00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.120]   out of him.
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:48.240]   Tim said I'm thrilled with it.
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:53.240]   And he did say that because they were asking why the margins were solo given the...
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.960]   Everyone assumes that margins on the apple watch are going to be stratospheric but they
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:57.800]   were actually projected to be quite low.
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:58.800]   Really?
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.440]   Tim said that those reports you see I'm guessing he means eye supply on the internet very seldom
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:06.200]   get anything close to accurate numbers about what it cost to make apple products.
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:10.480]   Yeah, he even gave some pretty conservative guidance about that and he got questioned
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:13.440]   about that a few times on the calls.
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:17.040]   Why is this margin number so low?
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:19.520]   Didn't really respond to it.
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.520]   No.
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:21.800]   I think they don't use off the shelf parts.
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.920]   Like, eye supply excels when you're using off the shelf parts.
[00:16:23.920 --> 00:16:27.720]   But if you look at the watch tear downs, a lot of the stuff isn't very accurate not because
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:31.960]   they're making a mistake in magic because apple is doing custom work, they're doing custom
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.440]   chips, custom glass.
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:36.480]   They're building machines that no one else has built before to make it and all of that
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:37.480]   sort of adds up.
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.280]   A lot of upgrades.
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.800]   20% of the active base is upgraded to iPhone 6 or 6 plus.
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:46.280]   I'm sure the watch will push that as well because if you use anything less than an iPhone
[00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:51.080]   5 older than an iPhone 5 you've got upgrade to use the watch.
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:58.400]   Anything else to say about the results of very success, every quarter, it's a record
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:01.600]   quarter, another great quarter.
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:03.520]   Well done.
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:05.440]   Profitable.
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:06.800]   Selling like crazy.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:11.160]   And even the iPad which is down 23% still sold a million units a week.
[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:12.160]   Yeah.
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:16.400]   I mean, the problem with the iPhone is that it humiliates every other product including
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.200]   Apple's own products.
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:21.240]   So it's easy to see, oh look at that poor little iPad line.
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:26.120]   They only sold more than pretty much any other individual model of tablet out there.
[00:17:26.120 --> 00:17:32.720]   But I think if there's something to look at, it's largely that it's kind of a, it's a
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:37.320]   little bit of a zero sum game that if someone does not have money to buy a new iPad is probably
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:39.720]   because they're putting it someplace else.
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:44.320]   And it's interesting to start to speculate as to where people are moving instead of moving
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:48.160]   back into tablets or if it's just that all the people that had a place in their heart
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.400]   and their lives for tablets have already bought them.
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:55.360]   And Apple or Apple and others have yet to come up with a good reason to buy a new tablet
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:59.520]   that will read Kindle books and watch videos better than the one they've had for the past
[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:02.000]   two and a half years.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:09.600]   In the chatroom, somebody's saying the admittedly last quarter for Apple was the best quarterly
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.560]   results of any company in history.
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:16.320]   This quarter, they were sixth.
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:19.560]   The sixth highest quarterly profit of any public company in history.
[00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:20.560]   Aww.
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:21.560]   Ever.
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:22.560]   Oh, they still have number one.
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:23.560]   Yeah, they got number one.
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:25.840]   And I bet you they have two, three, four, five and six.
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:30.040]   I'm guessing nothing like making all the cards in the middle of this week.
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:31.040]   It is.
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:32.040]   It's just remarkable to watch.
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:35.040]   Are there shareholders saying, have you considered going into arms trading?
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.640]   There's a lot of money in that.
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:41.080]   And you're being eclipsed by arms dealers now.
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:43.240]   It is, it is just remarkable.
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:47.520]   And of course, one of the ways you keep this growth up is by coming up with new stuff.
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:50.760]   Not every product is going to be an iPhone.
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:54.120]   That is unique in history, really, the success of the iPhone.
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:58.120]   I don't think you can compare it to anything else.
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.680]   Maybe when they invented fire, the adoption rate was higher.
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:01.680]   I don't know.
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.520]   Maybe some non-legal businesses you can get.
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:07.120]   I think it sells better than Coke, honestly.
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:11.040]   And it's probably got a higher profit margin.
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:14.160]   All right, Adam Christensen is here from MacCast.
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.240]   It's great to see you, Adam.
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:17.240]   Did you get an Apple watch?
[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:18.240]   I did.
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.240]   Got one.
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.240]   OK, let's see what you got.
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:21.240]   You got the sport with the blue band.
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:22.640]   I got the 38 millimeter blue.
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.680]   I got the bottom of the line.
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:26.240]   Cheapest thing you could go for.
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.240]   You know, it's funny.
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.240]   Which isn't cheap.
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.840]   Display mate, the results are in for the screen.
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:33.240]   They say you got the better screen, better even than Beyonce.
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:38.440]   I'll tell you that.
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:39.640]   Renee, you're wearing it.
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:40.840]   Are you sporting the watch?
[00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:43.840]   Yeah, I have a loner because mine's not going to arrive till mid-May.
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.440]   Millenese Loop 42?
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:46.440]   Yes, sir.
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:47.440]   OK.
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:50.640]   I got stainless 38 millenese loop.
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:51.640]   Andy, let's see.
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:52.640]   Wait a minute.
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:53.640]   You don't have an eye watch.
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:54.640]   I do not.
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:58.640]   I have my mundane Swiss Broadway watch.
[00:19:58.640 --> 00:19:59.640]   All right.
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:01.440]   Do you style design and elegance?
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.080]   Do you feel qualified to have an opinion or are you going to recuse yourself in this
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.080]   next segment?
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:08.840]   I'm going to recuse myself because I still have not read any reviews because I want
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:09.840]   to be smart.
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:12.440]   I want to be clean when I actually get my review hardware.
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:17.240]   Well, we'll put you in the soundproof booth because coming up next, our reviews of the
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:22.640]   Apple Watch stand by for reviews.
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:25.840]   But first a word from our friends at ITProTV.
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:30.840]   First of all, I want to thank ITProTV because sight unseen, they have agreed to sponsor
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:34.440]   the new screensaver show, which launches us on Saturday.
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:37.640]   That's nice when a sponsor says we believe in you guys, we know what you're doing is
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.140]   going to be great.
[00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:40.640]   We would like to buy ads on it.
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:42.640]   It's hard for us with new shows sometimes.
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.040]   It's all ads.
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:47.640]   But ITProTV, in a way we grew up together.
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:51.840]   When they started on Twitter about a year and a half ago, they were brand new in this
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:52.840]   business.
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:55.160]   Now, Tim and Donna not brand new in the business of teaching IT.
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.880]   That's their business and has been for more than a decade.
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:01.520]   But they had this kind of epiphany a couple of years ago.
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:07.320]   What if they thought we built something kind of like what Leo's done at Twitter, did live
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:13.780]   programming that you could watch on your tablet, on your desktop, on your Roku even, that would
[00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:18.500]   teach you the skills you need to get your certs in IT or to polish up your skills to
[00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:21.580]   get a better job, get a promotion.
[00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:23.900]   What if we did that?
[00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.220]   That's when they started about a year and a half ago, they've been advertising with
[00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:29.100]   us ever since and you know what they are.
[00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:31.220]   I hate to say it, but they're doing better than we are.
[00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:32.660]   They have built a second studio.
[00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:34.820]   They're on their way to five studios.
[00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:41.000]   They now do 50 hours of new programming every week, 50 live hours.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.600]   They do stuff I've wanted to do.
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:48.040]   You can get a text message when the live streaming starts up, darn them.
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:49.040]   It's really affordable.
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:53.920]   I have to say, 50, $7 a month, $570 if you buy a year at a time.
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:55.720]   That works out to 47, 50 months.
[00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:58.120]   But stay tuned because I'm going to tell you a couple of things.
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:03.920]   First of all, you could save considerably, but also about the free version of IT Pro TV.
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:08.860]   Take a look, itpro.tv/macbreak.
[00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:10.420]   They do all the most popular certs.
[00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:17.000]   They Apple, Microsoft, Cisco, A+CCNA, security plus MCSA, CISSP, network security, on and
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   on.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   We talked about it.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.400]   They got Sean Phillip Oriano and he's the guy who wrote the book on certified ethical
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.020]   hacker cert.
[00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:31.140]   He did it live and you could watch for free the ethical hacker courses.
[00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:33.500]   They're now available for download and watching.
[00:22:33.500 --> 00:22:42.060]   Boy, I tell you, we know this is an area where people are going to be hiring big time.
[00:22:42.060 --> 00:22:44.900]   In fact, didn't we have Mark Goodman on the Future Crimes author who said there will
[00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:48.260]   be 1 million IT security jobs in the next few years?
[00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:49.820]   1 million.
[00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:52.540]   This is a skill worth its weight in gold.
[00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:54.740]   They gave it away for free, by the way.
[00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:58.940]   You can also get for free the measure up practice exams, the $79 value.
[00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:04.540]   If you wish, you can take the test before you take the test, which I think is a great
[00:23:04.540 --> 00:23:06.180]   idea.
[00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:09.380]   You don't have to even have, if you're studying Windows, for instance, you don't even have
[00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:14.820]   to have the Windows server.
[00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:21.860]   This is the coolest thing, a virtual Windows server sandbox that runs in any HTML5 browser.
[00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:27.420]   You can set up a Windows server, a couple of clients, break it, which I always do, then
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:31.060]   you just quietly quit and come back later.
[00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:32.060]   It's so cool.
[00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:35.820]   Because they're live, you can interact with a host via chat, just like our shows during
[00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:39.540]   the live show, web-based Q&As for study topics.
[00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:43.820]   Even if you already are in a course or you're using a book, this is a great way to learn.
[00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:45.820]   Corporate and group pricing is available.
[00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:47.980]   Harvard uses ITProTV.
[00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:49.500]   MIT does.
[00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:51.300]   Stanford does, okay?
[00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:52.300]   Okay.
[00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:55.300]   I mean, I tell you, these guys are knocking out of the park art.
[00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:56.300]   Here's the deal.
[00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:57.540]   A couple of things.
[00:23:57.540 --> 00:24:01.180]   First of all, you can't create a free account and watch live for free.
[00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:06.780]   That might be something you want to do because it just started yesterday, but you can still
[00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:12.860]   tune in from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern for the next three weeks, hacking forensics investigator
[00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:13.860]   and cryptography.
[00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:16.740]   Oh, that's sweet.
[00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:18.140]   That is so sweet.
[00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:21.140]   If you decide you want to buy, and I think you might have to watch a little bit of this,
[00:24:21.140 --> 00:24:24.660]   because it's great to have, if you buy a year, by the way, you can download everything, put
[00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:27.340]   it on an iPad and take it on the plane or wherever.
[00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:28.740]   You can watch it anytime.
[00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:31.340]   Again, I said $57 a month tonight.
[00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:35.180]   Well, take 30% off with the offer code MAC break 30.
[00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:38.700]   That brings it down to $40 a month, $3.99 for a whole year.
[00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:40.780]   That's the best deal.
[00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:41.780]   Incredible.
[00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:42.780]   ITProTV.tv/Macbreak.
[00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:47.100]   If you're ready to improve your skills, if you're ready to get a job in IT&O, a lot
[00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:49.540]   of you watch and say, "I want to do this for a living."
[00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:52.100]   This is the place ITProTV.tv/Macbreak.
[00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:54.900]   Don't forget the offer code MACbreak30 for 30% off.
[00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:56.740]   By the way, that's not just the first month or year.
[00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:57.740]   That's forever.
[00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:00.140]   That's for the life of your account.
[00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:01.300]   Thank you, ITProTV.
[00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:03.220]   And now I'm jealous.
[00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:04.220]   Darn you, ITProTV.
[00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:08.940]   They're doing five studios they're going to build.
[00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:10.900]   Five things at once.
[00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:12.820]   All right.
[00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:14.780]   We're three out of four wearing the watch.
[00:25:14.780 --> 00:25:18.900]   The force is sitting in a soundproof booth, so he won't be tainted by our opinions.
[00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:22.580]   I just got a new Deanna Domra CD came in just today.
[00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:27.100]   Oh, I'll be listening to it during the conversation.
[00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:28.980]   Yeah, I'm not.
[00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:30.300]   I'll say something right up front.
[00:25:30.300 --> 00:25:31.300]   It is easily the best.
[00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:35.940]   Now I've worn all the smart watches, including the weird galaxy gears and all the different
[00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:36.940]   watches.
[00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:40.500]   And of course, I'm a fan of Android Wear and I've been wearing quite a bit.
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:42.020]   I'll say something right up front.
[00:25:42.020 --> 00:25:44.660]   I mean, in terms of looks, it's great.
[00:25:44.660 --> 00:25:45.660]   I've asked a number of people.
[00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:48.420]   Some people say, "Yeah, it still looks kind of geeky."
[00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:49.820]   But I think it looks great.
[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:54.420]   I like the Milanese Loop, but there are lots of different kinds of bands.
[00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:58.380]   The other thing in display, I made confirm this today, but I've been thinking this all
[00:25:58.380 --> 00:25:59.380]   long.
[00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:00.820]   It is a great display.
[00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:04.300]   This is Apple's first OLED display.
[00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:08.420]   All the Android Wear watches are LCD, I believe, IPS LCD.
[00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:10.260]   There are some Samsung OLED displays.
[00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:14.300]   I think many of the Samsung watches use OLED, but OLED has some real advantages.
[00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:15.660]   First of all, incredible contrast.
[00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:18.700]   The blacks are in key black, the whites are white, white, white, white.
[00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:24.620]   And that also saves power because only the lighter dots need to be powered.
[00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:26.900]   You don't need a backlight for the whole thing as you do on LCD.
[00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:29.380]   You can just light the part of the screen that's being used.
[00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:33.580]   But it also gives you an incredible looking high-res display.
[00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:35.340]   Well, it's over 300 dots per inch.
[00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:39.700]   I did not know that, but they broke out the calipers at display mate.
[00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:43.620]   And even the 38 millimeter is over 300 dots per inch.
[00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:44.620]   I think.
[00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:45.900]   Now maybe 277.
[00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:47.900]   It's pretty good.
[00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:52.700]   So just from cosmetics, just looking on the outside, not at the software, but just at
[00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:57.500]   the outside, I think it's a good-looking watch with a very nice-looking screen.
[00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:00.260]   Adam, what do you think?
[00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:02.620]   Yeah, I agree with that a lot.
[00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:05.620]   I was really actually impressed.
[00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:07.900]   The Flora Lastimer band.
[00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:09.620]   You like the rubber band.
[00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:11.020]   Well, how comfortable it is.
[00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:13.940]   Yeah, I wore a pebble for the past.
[00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:15.700]   I think over a year.
[00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:18.140]   And so I'm moving from the pebble to this.
[00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:22.500]   And I've been very impressed just with the wearability of it.
[00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:24.980]   I want to ultimately get a band.
[00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:27.780]   I just didn't want to pay the Apple tax on some of the bands.
[00:27:27.780 --> 00:27:28.780]   I'd like to have a letter.
[00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:29.780]   You think they'll be third party bands?
[00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:30.780]   I guess it's a standard.
[00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:31.780]   There's going to be a ton.
[00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:35.940]   And there was some rumors that Apple was going to have a certification program even.
[00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:38.180]   So I'm looking forward.
[00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:40.340]   I want to get something in probably in leather.
[00:27:40.340 --> 00:27:42.220]   It'd be nice to have a couple different options.
[00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:48.500]   But my budget doesn't allow for $150 classic buckle band.
[00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.620]   Those are beautiful, though, aren't they?
[00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:51.780]   All the bands are very nice.
[00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:55.980]   Like I said, it is technically, I guess, rubber.
[00:27:55.980 --> 00:28:00.500]   But whatever the material is, doesn't feel like any other rubber strap that I've ever
[00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:02.980]   worn on a sports watch or a swatch.
[00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:06.700]   I mean, it's really soft and supple and very, very comfortable to wear a hard-to-wear
[00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:07.700]   I'd leave.
[00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:09.260]   Why'd you get to 38?
[00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:11.420]   I was going for the 42.
[00:28:11.420 --> 00:28:13.180]   That's why I'm like the 38.
[00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:14.980]   Well, in my house--
[00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:16.980]   It's my wife's.
[00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:19.620]   We do some past down of technology.
[00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:21.900]   And so my wife didn't want one day one.
[00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:25.660]   But when I asked her last minute, do you think you'd ever want it?
[00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:27.260]   And then we started talking about some of the features.
[00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:28.820]   She said, you know, I may.
[00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:33.180]   So I went with the 38 because she really didn't have any interest in the 42.
[00:28:33.180 --> 00:28:35.900]   And I know I'll be upgrading whenever the next one comes out.
[00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:36.700]   Same with me.
[00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:38.340]   Same up to the 42 then.
[00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:41.620]   And I want to be able to send Lisa my heartbeat and all that stuff.
[00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:43.300]   All right.
[00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:47.700]   You know, that's another one of those features that I thought right out of the gate.
[00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:48.700]   How come on?
[00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:49.860]   This is not going to be a thing.
[00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:53.180]   But it's actually kind of an interesting--
[00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:56.540]   Have you been able to send touches and heartbeats to people yet?
[00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:57.900]   Yeah, my brother.
[00:28:57.900 --> 00:28:59.100]   Yeah, isn't that sweet?
[00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:00.740]   I mean, I like them a lot.
[00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:02.140]   I'm sending them to a stranger.
[00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:06.700]   The only other person I know with an Apple watch is some guy that we've emailed.
[00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:08.180]   I don't even know who it was at first.
[00:29:08.180 --> 00:29:10.060]   See, I'm sending a heartbeat right now.
[00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:15.660]   It's a brilliant plan to breed the next generation of Apple fans will buy anything because the
[00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:19.780]   only one you can send your heartbeat of love to are other people who bought an Apple watch
[00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:22.060]   at 30 seconds past midnight.
[00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:23.060]   That's exactly right.
[00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:24.060]   Exactly right.
[00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:26.020]   In fact, Lisa, I can't send her one yet.
[00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:26.980]   She's letting me wear her watch.
[00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:31.180]   She doesn't have one yet until I get mine, which is in a couple of weeks.
[00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:33.820]   So I'm sending heartbeats to strangers, drawing little pictures.
[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:38.020]   Look, he's drawing me a picture now.
[00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:40.700]   Quickly, I'm curious on the size.
[00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:43.700]   I had been wearing that pedal, which I think is about 50 millimeters.
[00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:45.260]   I mean, it's pretty big.
[00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:47.940]   The same thing with the Android Wear is much bigger.
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:51.660]   Yeah, and when I went to do my try-on, I got to try on both.
[00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:55.740]   I was pretty worried and disappointed because I was like, oh, I think I really wanted the
[00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:56.740]   42.
[00:29:56.740 --> 00:30:03.380]   But I think a lot of that, too, was just having the two side-by-side and having the comparison.
[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:06.020]   Because now, after wearing this, it feels fine.
[00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:10.660]   I think I still want the slightly larger just for me.
[00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:14.340]   But it doesn't feel like a compromise, I guess, is what I was worried it was going to feel
[00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:16.140]   like I had really compromised on the screen.
[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:19.740]   I'm not feeling that way after having worn it for a few days now.
[00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:24.460]   Can I make one point that I actually had to take a picture of when I bought this watch
[00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:28.740]   like five or six years ago, I was waffling on this a lot because it is larger than any
[00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:29.740]   other watch I've ever bought.
[00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:35.780]   I used to have a Timex that was probably 38 or a little bit smaller than that.
[00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:38.700]   Even this seemed like it was going to be an enormous watch.
[00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:42.340]   But after about two or three days of wearing it, I realized that it wasn't a big watch.
[00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:44.460]   It was just bigger than what I was used to.
[00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:48.020]   If people who are trying to decide between 38 and 42, and they think that, gee, I think
[00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:52.580]   the 42 is going to be a lot more readable, but I'm thrown off by how big it is, consider
[00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:55.700]   the size of the watch you're wearing right now or the fact that you don't wear a watch,
[00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:58.020]   and that might help you to decide.
[00:30:58.020 --> 00:31:02.660]   I want to thank Stephen Hall, who's been sending me heartbeats and drawings and stuff so I
[00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:05.180]   could demo.
[00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:08.780]   So Leo, of all the things that people have been sketching to you, how many of them are
[00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:09.780]   non-broadcastable?
[00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:16.620]   Or what Tim writes, do people just do people just do pictures of kitty cats?
[00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:17.780]   It's not that big.
[00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:19.780]   You really can't draw any genitalia.
[00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:20.780]   Oh yes, you can.
[00:31:20.780 --> 00:31:21.780]   Yes, you can.
[00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:28.100]   So many, so many genitalias.
[00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:29.100]   Okay.
[00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:32.820]   Five dollar donation to the World Wildlife Fund every time.
[00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:36.180]   Okay, I'm going to give you all a chance to yell at me now because I'm going to tell
[00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:38.100]   you what I think about the guts, the insides.
[00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:40.900]   I mean, it's beautiful and I'll acknowledge that as a great screen.
[00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:44.140]   Having worn, and I'm curious what you guys have to say, having worn smart watches now
[00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:45.860]   for more than a year.
[00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:46.940]   I'm a little disappointed.
[00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:47.940]   This doesn't seem groundbreaking.
[00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:53.140]   In fact, in some ways, the heartbeat and the drawings, that is not a selling point, frankly,
[00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:54.140]   for me.
[00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:55.140]   No.
[00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:57.500]   I think it's a little busier than it ought to be.
[00:31:57.500 --> 00:32:04.420]   There's a lot of manipulation and fiddling to get it to do things.
[00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:08.620]   And I just feel like it's not a breakthrough in the sense that it's in a particular regard
[00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:11.860]   better than Android Wear or the watches that have been out there.
[00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:14.700]   I think the screen is better than the Android Wear screens.
[00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:19.260]   It's nice to be able to take and make phone calls, but it's not something probably I
[00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:22.580]   will do a lot of.
[00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:24.980]   I don't find it particularly impressive.
[00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:26.580]   It's not bad.
[00:32:26.580 --> 00:32:31.300]   If you want a smart watch, it's a good choice among all the smart watches, but I think most
[00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:35.540]   people will not find this a great utility.
[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:38.060]   I think a lot of people just, I mean, don't feel bad.
[00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:39.900]   In other words, I guess is what I'm saying.
[00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:43.980]   If you didn't get one or you don't want one or you can't afford one because I don't feel
[00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:46.060]   like you're missing a lot of functionality.
[00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:47.060]   Agreed?
[00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:48.060]   Disagree?
[00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:49.460]   Go ahead, Adam.
[00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:50.460]   Fight me.
[00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:52.460]   Beat me up on this.
[00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:54.820]   I think it has a lot more functionality than my pebble did.
[00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:59.860]   I have not worn an Android Wear, so I can't really compare to that sort of thing.
[00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:00.860]   Let me say this.
[00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:04.820]   No watch that works with Apple is going to do as well as this because Apple just locks
[00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:05.820]   everything down.
[00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:09.260]   And so only Apple really has access to all the features of the phone.
[00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:10.260]   Yeah.
[00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:17.220]   But with Android, I think gives you as much functionality, almost as much, in some cases
[00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:19.620]   not, but you can't send a heartbeat.
[00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:20.620]   Yeah.
[00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:25.300]   I think some of it too though is early stage and functionality.
[00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:29.860]   I definitely feel like there's some bugs, there's some things that Apple will be able
[00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:32.580]   to tweak maybe into the software in the UI.
[00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:35.700]   I'm not super happy with how I navigate through Blamps.
[00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:37.220]   This is insane.
[00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:38.220]   Come on.
[00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:39.580]   You have way more apps installed.
[00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:43.940]   I think that's another thing is I think pairing down the number of apps that you're interacting
[00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:47.540]   with to really those ones that are essential, that really helps a lot.
[00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:54.220]   So I think some of it is tailoring the watch to what you need it to do.
[00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:55.220]   Right.
[00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:58.940]   I've certainly done that with Glances because you can have so many Glances that the problem
[00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:02.620]   with Glances is they're individual pages and you have to find what you're.
[00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:05.340]   There's no quick way to go to a glance that you want.
[00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:06.780]   You have to swipe through them.
[00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:07.780]   Yeah.
[00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:09.100]   I hope they can tweak that.
[00:34:09.100 --> 00:34:12.980]   I mean, you can go into the settings and you can move them or change the order around and
[00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:13.980]   prioritize them.
[00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:19.140]   So maybe the ones you accessed most frequently are closer to one end or the other end.
[00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:21.620]   But yeah, I've found that a little bit tricky to navigate.
[00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:26.580]   I mean, these are things that can really be overcome as far as the day-to-day utility
[00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:28.180]   and functionality of it.
[00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:37.340]   I'm finding as days go on, it's slowly integrating its way into more and more parts of my day.
[00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:38.340]   Okay.
[00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:40.420]   So there's somebody who works out.
[00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:41.740]   There's some real advantages to it.
[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:46.100]   Let me see if I can manage to navigate to the workout.
[00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:51.260]   I was going to say that the workout stuff for me has been, you know, I was using the
[00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:53.820]   Misfit app on my Pebble which is really nice.
[00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:54.820]   Yeah.
[00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:57.660]   But again, this is a lot nicer and tracking those.
[00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:59.900]   I'm not so sure about the awards that they give out.
[00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:01.340]   I haven't quite figured those out yet.
[00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:02.340]   Yeah.
[00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:04.340]   They're little weird, little 3D images.
[00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:05.340]   They're strange.
[00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:06.340]   Yeah.
[00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:07.340]   The first one I got was looked like a target.
[00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:08.340]   There was no words.
[00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:09.780]   There was no, you know, congratulations.
[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:13.020]   It was just like spinning, I guess, metal.
[00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:14.020]   Yeah.
[00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:15.500]   It's a little funky.
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:16.940]   So here's an outdoor cycle.
[00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:18.340]   Oh, somebody's tapping me.
[00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:19.340]   Okay.
[00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:20.340]   This is another issue.
[00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:22.220]   Also, do you find it slow to launch things?
[00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:24.060]   Like I spent a lot of time watching it.
[00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:26.140]   They need, they still need to tweak the software a little bit.
[00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:30.700]   I've had some hang-ups and crashes, most specifically with some of the Siri functionality where
[00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:35.260]   it'll just sort of go dead for, you know, several seconds.
[00:35:35.260 --> 00:35:39.340]   I actually had to reset the watch because it was stopped doing my heart rate for three
[00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:40.340]   days.
[00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:41.340]   Yeah, but again, this is all early stage stuff.
[00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:45.260]   You know, I mean, version one, it's really, really good.
[00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:49.820]   I mean, I don't want to focus too much on the negatives because I'm pretty positive about
[00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:50.820]   it so far.
[00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:51.820]   Yeah.
[00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:55.620]   Well, and the main reason is I think that I want to make sure people don't feel any
[00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:59.420]   FOMO or need to rush out and get one.
[00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:00.420]   Yeah.
[00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:01.420]   Yeah.
[00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:05.420]   So the thing that I've been saying is that I don't think it's going to take us all about
[00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:09.460]   a month or month and a half to really come up with longstanding opinions on Apple Watch
[00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:12.740]   because developers have not figured out how to write apps for it yet.
[00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:14.500]   And now they see it in the flesh.
[00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:17.180]   They know how to adapt their apps to make it more relevant.
[00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:20.260]   People have never, most of the people who are buying this have never worn a smart watch
[00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:21.260]   before.
[00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:23.380]   So they're not used to how to integrate that into your lives.
[00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:27.620]   There are a lot of things that really, so a lot of first impressions are going to be
[00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:31.860]   valid as first impressions, but maybe if you circle back to those people in a month and
[00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:34.540]   ask them the same questions, again, they'll have very different answers.
[00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:39.780]   I think that estimation of Apple Watch is probably going to go up a little bit as people,
[00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:41.660]   as users and developers figure this out.
[00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:42.820]   I agree with you.
[00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:43.820]   I agree with you.
[00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:47.340]   There's a lot of, but all you all were really saying is there's a lot of improvement.
[00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:48.340]   Yeah.
[00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:52.620]   I mean, this is, I do think that I predicted and I think I'm being demonstrated as being
[00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:58.100]   correct that this is an early believer device right now and that's that's not meant as
[00:36:58.100 --> 00:36:59.100]   an insult.
[00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:02.380]   There are people who wanted to be the first people to have electric cars because they
[00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:06.020]   knew that the first generation was not going to be as good as the second or third generation,
[00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:09.100]   but they believe in and support this product.
[00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:14.020]   This idea so wholeheartedly that they're eager to be one of these first people to kind
[00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:17.140]   of figure out how well these things work.
[00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:20.700]   And so people who are really excited about a wearable are going to be very, very happy
[00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:24.420]   about it, despite any failings that they might see in it.
[00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:28.740]   People who are buying it because they feel as though this is a simple consumer transaction
[00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:29.740]   for $350.
[00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:34.660]   I'm going to get a finalized, finished, polished product that's as good as half as good as
[00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:37.780]   or completely as good as they're ever going to be, they might be disappointed.
[00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:42.420]   And I don't want people to be tainted by the reactions of those folks.
[00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:45.620]   And his point about developers is really good too because that was something I wanted to
[00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:46.620]   mention also.
[00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:51.740]   And the software side of things, developers have had to throw out apps and build stuff
[00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:53.700]   really sight unseen.
[00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:56.100]   And some of the apps are really, really great.
[00:37:56.100 --> 00:38:00.500]   Some of them, you just go, yeah, this really needs to be kind of be rethought and redone,
[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:01.940]   but they didn't have anything to go off of.
[00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:04.100]   So I don't necessarily fault them for that.
[00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:08.580]   It's going to take some time to figure out what's appropriate, what works well, what
[00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:12.100]   doesn't work well in this new kind of device for them.
[00:38:12.100 --> 00:38:15.780]   So that's another thing that's only going to get better over time, I think.
[00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:17.980]   But at the gate, they've done a great job.
[00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:20.180]   Long term, I think it's going to get even better.
[00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:23.260]   All right, Renee, you've been nice and quiet.
[00:38:23.260 --> 00:38:24.260]   Yeah.
[00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:25.260]   He's gone.
[00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:26.980]   Oh, did he fall over?
[00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:29.300]   No, he's sorry.
[00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:30.620]   He had to step away real quick.
[00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:32.180]   He had a call that just came in.
[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:33.180]   Okay.
[00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:34.180]   We'll get Renee.
[00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:35.980]   I thought I thought Renee was very quiet.
[00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:42.460]   This is the level of tension that everybody who ordered it in the first five minutes has
[00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:46.500]   any knock on the door could be UPS person with an early delivery.
[00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:48.780]   They will not let that person walk away.
[00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:50.660]   Some watches have been delivered early, by the way.
[00:38:50.660 --> 00:38:54.780]   Callie, Luria, Patricia was on yesterday on "Tranulation Great Show."
[00:38:54.780 --> 00:38:56.900]   If you want to watch that, if you're a fan.
[00:38:56.900 --> 00:39:00.580]   And she did not expect her for till June, and she got it.
[00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:06.700]   So some are coming early, but Apple has not said, and we did speculate last week that
[00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:13.020]   if Apple had a marvelous sales sell-through, that they would say something, they have in
[00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:14.020]   the past.
[00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:15.260]   We sold a million this weekend.
[00:39:15.260 --> 00:39:16.860]   They've said nothing.
[00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:18.260]   So we don't really know.
[00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:19.460]   We don't know how many have been delivered.
[00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:22.780]   There have been speculation that it's only maybe a third of the total ordered.
[00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:23.780]   We don't know.
[00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:24.780]   No one knows.
[00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:29.460]   I'll tell you where my disappointment lies, and it's not really disappointment.
[00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:31.740]   It's not kind of anything I didn't expect.
[00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:36.500]   But me being an Apple fan, people doubt that, but it's true.
[00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:37.500]   I love Apple stuff.
[00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:39.980]   I bought everything ever.
[00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:43.140]   I own it all, including the 20th anniversary Macintosh.
[00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:46.020]   It was just sitting over there on use.
[00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:49.020]   But as an Apple fan, I've seen Apple do this before.
[00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:50.020]   They did it with the iPod.
[00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:51.660]   They did it with the iPhone.
[00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:57.500]   They did it with the iPad, where they took an existing category, and tweaked it in such
[00:39:57.500 --> 00:39:59.460]   a way that it made it work.
[00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:01.620]   It was like, "Oh, wow.
[00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:03.220]   They've sprinkled their fairy dust on it.
[00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:05.260]   Now I'm really into this category."
[00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:11.940]   And I was hoping, hopeful but not confident, that they would do something similar, and to
[00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:14.340]   date anyway, they haven't.
[00:40:14.340 --> 00:40:18.180]   I'll tell you the one thing they've done that is remarkable, and that is the double
[00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:23.540]   tap on the home or the friends button to launch Apple Pay.
[00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:26.540]   They're right there with the double tap as my credit card.
[00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:30.540]   I can swipe through them, and I can tap it to the touch to pay.
[00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:35.580]   In fact, I'm going to use it after the show, because apparently yesterday, our Petaluma
[00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:38.220]   market just added this Apple Pay capability.
[00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:43.180]   So I am really thinking that might be a killer app, where you just go, "Yeah, I got it."
[00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:46.020]   It's certainly going to convince people, too, who have not signed up for Apple Pay to sign
[00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:49.740]   up for it, because I'm sure that they're accidentally triggering this because they're
[00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:54.580]   just there in by hour two, you're in what happens if I triple press and then hold, let's
[00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:55.580]   see what happens.
[00:40:55.580 --> 00:41:00.940]   But you had a really good point there that I think was one of the article, and was it
[00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:05.140]   wired, or the New Yorker, in which Johnny Ivers, one of the other head designers was
[00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:09.740]   talking about, the difference between how Apple built this watch versus how they built
[00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:10.740]   the iPhone.
[00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:15.180]   They said that the iPhone was built, we was designed based on everything that we hated
[00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:17.780]   about the phones that are in all of our pockets.
[00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:22.580]   And they hate made them quite powerful and allowed them to build something that was quite
[00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:23.580]   spectacular.
[00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:26.980]   But then they said that's not there, that's my comment, not theirs.
[00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:29.420]   But then they said that with the watch, it was exactly the opposite.
[00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:32.700]   We built this watch based on everything that we love about the wrist watches that we wear
[00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:35.940]   all the time, and we tried to translate that into a tech device.
[00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:42.780]   So to my mind, it's kind of interesting to see, are they best motivated by looking at
[00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:46.580]   something they hate and trying to fix it, or are they best motivated by saying, "Here's
[00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:48.260]   everything that we really, really like.
[00:41:48.260 --> 00:41:52.620]   Now let's sort of translate that into our own aesthetic and our own ethos."
[00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:58.140]   Somebody's saying, "Well maybe in time, Proteus says it's only in hindsight that we'll see
[00:41:58.140 --> 00:41:59.500]   the Apple got it right thing."
[00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:00.500]   I disagree.
[00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:05.180]   I think the iPhone you immediately got what a breakthrough that was.
[00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:06.500]   The iPad, same thing.
[00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:08.620]   The iPod, the same thing.
[00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:13.100]   Now it may be, I think one of the things that could make this a breakthrough product is
[00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:14.820]   the ecosystem.
[00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:17.740]   And Apple has mixed, I have to say, has mixed results.
[00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:20.740]   I'm still waiting for eye beacons to be everywhere.
[00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:24.140]   They have mixed results in making ecosystem plays.
[00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:29.700]   But if they could expand the ecosystem so that this watch becomes hideously useful at
[00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:36.780]   the airport, at the grocery store, at the gym, that could make a huge difference.
[00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:39.020]   And that's something that will only happen in time.
[00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:40.500]   Well, that's developers.
[00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:45.260]   I mean, that's them getting to that point where hopefully at WWDC this year, we see the
[00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:48.540]   Apple Watch API to write native apps.
[00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:50.260]   And once that starts opening up.
[00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:54.780]   So we're at a starting point here and they're doing a lot of amazing things.
[00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:58.660]   But like I said earlier, the potential is only even bigger.
[00:42:58.660 --> 00:43:05.340]   Yeah, it's going to be so hard because remember that as radical as the iPod was, as radical
[00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:10.780]   as the iPhone was, even as radical as the iPad was, we had had disc man's and portable
[00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:13.260]   music players and we had had phones in our pockets at that point.
[00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:19.980]   And we had had even e-book readers and computers that we carry around with us.
[00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:23.740]   I don't think Apple has ever been in this position where you have never worn a smart
[00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:25.820]   watch in your entire life.
[00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:30.780]   So we're going to have to start with convincing you of why you would want to wear a gadget
[00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:36.380]   on your wrist and why it would be specifically this gadget, why you would give up your grandfather's
[00:43:36.380 --> 00:43:41.300]   retirement watch, why you would give up this other or the bare wrist that you decided that
[00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:45.340]   you prefer to having a watch on your wrist and put this on your wrist instead.
[00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:50.460]   So I think all of that has to be factored in when we think about how successful Apple
[00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:51.460]   is going to be.
[00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:57.940]   The first time that we get real good numbers on how well it's selling after the first initial
[00:43:57.940 --> 00:44:05.140]   burst of excitement, it's not a failure if it's a slow build because it's hard to overestimate
[00:44:05.140 --> 00:44:08.820]   the challenge that Apple faces in educating people about this product.
[00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:10.860]   Now Renee, it's back, by the way.
[00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:11.860]   Thank you, Renee.
[00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:12.860]   You've followed us.
[00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:14.460]   You missed the whole discussion.
[00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:15.460]   Did you watch?
[00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:16.460]   Did you watch Arrive?
[00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:17.460]   Did you watch Arrive?
[00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:18.460]   Did you watch Arrive?
[00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:19.460]   Did you watch Arrive?
[00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:20.460]   Did you watch Arrive?
[00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:21.460]   Did me?
[00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:22.460]   Did me?
[00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:23.460]   Did me from my 42 as well.
[00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:24.460]   What do you think on the 38 versus 42?
[00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:30.340]   I mean, there is a significant difference not just in size but in screen resolution and
[00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:31.420]   in battery.
[00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:34.860]   I mean, neither of these are tiny nor large watches.
[00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:38.900]   Like a lot of people will consider a large watch around 46 millimeters and a small watch,
[00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:41.220]   maybe 36 even 34 millimeters.
[00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:43.820]   So Apple's kind of gotten two options in the middle.
[00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:46.980]   And yes, there is battery life advantage in screen size and touch target advantage if
[00:44:46.980 --> 00:44:48.180]   you go bigger.
[00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:49.580]   But there's also a loss of profile.
[00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:52.460]   Some people like the smaller profile, the lighter profile if you're jogging, if you
[00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:53.900]   wear it underneath tight sleeves.
[00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:57.460]   So I mean, there's a lot of factors and I like that they're both sort of in the middle
[00:44:57.460 --> 00:44:59.500]   now because you can just choose.
[00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:01.860]   If it looks way too big on your wrist, you go a little bit smaller.
[00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:05.420]   If it looks a little bit too small, it becomes more of a matter of personal taste unless you're
[00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:12.180]   at the extreme of, you know, giant Schwarzenegger or small Elfen sort of wrists.
[00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:17.540]   You didn't hear probably my take on this, which was a it is it's nice to wear something
[00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:21.380]   on your wrist that is designed by two of the best designers in the world, Johnny Ive.
[00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:22.700]   And my hardware is fan.
[00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:25.540]   The industrial design is I think is the best thing Apple's ever made in that saying a lot.
[00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:26.540]   It is gorgeous.
[00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:28.140]   And you know, pulling off the band is easy.
[00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:30.460]   I like the band choices.
[00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:31.500]   Some say it's the looks geeky.
[00:45:31.500 --> 00:45:32.620]   I think it looks really nice.
[00:45:32.620 --> 00:45:33.940]   I'm this is a watch.
[00:45:33.940 --> 00:45:35.700]   I'm happy to wear.
[00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:40.060]   Having said that, I felt that it isn't a breakthrough in the way that Apple has made
[00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:46.020]   a breakthrough in other cases with the iPhone iPad and it's much it's not significantly
[00:45:46.020 --> 00:45:47.460]   different than other smart watches.
[00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:50.540]   I've worn my feelings are complicated and I think that's that's a good thing.
[00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:54.420]   So like when the iPhone came out, a lot of people really liked it, but I had a trio and
[00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:57.340]   I was like, ah, no, MMS, no apps.
[00:45:57.340 --> 00:45:58.580]   We're sort of more educated now.
[00:45:58.580 --> 00:46:01.980]   This is maybe analogous to the original iPhone where it does some things very nice, but doesn't
[00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:05.100]   do everything or some things that doesn't do as well.
[00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:08.220]   And maybe some other products do other things better, but is there a workflow or is there
[00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:10.580]   something about it that makes it extremely valuable?
[00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:14.300]   I'd argue the original iPhone and iPad, that little, you know, photo zoom demo probably
[00:46:14.300 --> 00:46:18.620]   did as much to sell it as any of the core technologies because it made for a great video
[00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:21.740]   just watching Steve jobs or watching your friends do it.
[00:46:21.740 --> 00:46:25.220]   And I've been using the watch for, I don't know, almost a week now.
[00:46:25.220 --> 00:46:27.380]   In some ways, it's way better than I thought it was going to be.
[00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:28.780]   And I thought it was going to be pretty good.
[00:46:28.780 --> 00:46:29.780]   I'd use the pebble.
[00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:32.700]   I'd use Android Wear for a short amount of time.
[00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:35.780]   And the things that it let me do and my core value for this was convenience.
[00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:39.740]   It could just the same way my iPhone lets me not have to go back to my Mac all the time.
[00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:43.260]   If my Apple watch could let me not go back to my iPhone all the time, especially when
[00:46:43.260 --> 00:46:47.540]   I'm in cars or in planes and trying to pull it out or at a store, that to me would be
[00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:48.540]   a huge win.
[00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:51.740]   And I had the benefit of flying back with it on Sunday.
[00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:56.300]   And I literally I woke up, trip it, had a notification on my watch saying my plane
[00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:57.300]   was on time.
[00:46:57.300 --> 00:46:58.820]   I went across to the coffee shop.
[00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:00.460]   I bought my coffee with my watch.
[00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:01.460]   I sat there.
[00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:02.460]   I kept track of the flight.
[00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:03.460]   I got up.
[00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:06.140]   I called an Uber instead of pulling my phone out of my pocket every two minutes.
[00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:10.860]   I just watched the Uber arrive on the watch, drove their checked notifications.
[00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:13.820]   Most of the time I can't tell who's texting me on my phone.
[00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:15.220]   And some of them are really important.
[00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:16.780]   So I pull it out no matter who it is.
[00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:20.380]   And on this I could just look and see whether it was really something important and my phone
[00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:22.260]   could stay in my pocket most of the time.
[00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:25.140]   And I got to the airport and my boarding pass was on my Apple watch.
[00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:26.460]   So I have bags I'm carrying.
[00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:27.940]   I don't have to hold the phone in one hand.
[00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:29.220]   I can just turn the Apple watch.
[00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:31.820]   And they do this nice thing for Starbucks and for Air Canada.
[00:47:31.820 --> 00:47:35.380]   And a lot of apps where when the barcode comes up, everything else fades to black and
[00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:38.500]   it just makes the barcode as visible as possible.
[00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:40.280]   So it scans super easily.
[00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:42.940]   And on the flight I usually pull my iPhone out because I get impatient and I check how
[00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:44.700]   long it is and when I'm landing.
[00:47:44.700 --> 00:47:47.780]   And this again I just turn my wrist and the information was right there.
[00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:51.500]   So on convenience alone for me it was a huge win.
[00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:53.740]   And yes some of the apps aren't well considered.
[00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:56.580]   And if you try to use it like an iPhone and tap around it's hard to find apps.
[00:47:56.580 --> 00:47:57.940]   I just say hey Siri.
[00:47:57.940 --> 00:47:58.940]   Um, Trippit.
[00:47:58.940 --> 00:47:59.940]   Hey Siri.
[00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:00.940]   Uh, Uber.
[00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:02.500]   Sorry for everyone whose phones.
[00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:03.500]   By the way it is.
[00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:04.660]   That is the way to launch stuff.
[00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:07.260]   We were talking about that crazy grid.
[00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:08.860]   Uh, and it was a revelation.
[00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:11.780]   Megan Maroney yesterday I had today said can't you just ask Siri to launch stuff.
[00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:13.740]   And when you do that, that works well.
[00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:17.180]   Have you experienced this Siri actually works better on the watch than it does on the phone?
[00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:18.740]   It seems to be.
[00:48:18.740 --> 00:48:20.820]   There's several reasons why that is.
[00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:23.780]   Um, and there's, there was a presentation that Apple did a couple of days ago that you
[00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:26.100]   can find on the web about the new architectures that they're using.
[00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:28.740]   But there's a lot of really good new Siri technology.
[00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:31.300]   If you add me on your watch, I'll send you Batman head.
[00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:32.580]   That would be cool.
[00:48:32.580 --> 00:48:34.780]   Not, not, I will add you on my watch.
[00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:36.260]   I actually tried to it.
[00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:37.260]   I don't have your phone number.
[00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:39.180]   So I just IDM'd it to you.
[00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:40.180]   Thank you.
[00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:41.180]   Um, so yeah.
[00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:42.180]   So I'm going to skip.
[00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:43.180]   I've been sending the sketches.
[00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:44.180]   I have a lot of friends with Apple.
[00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:47.940]   So some people were saying I was saying I want more friends because my sister and my
[00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:49.100]   mom got it.
[00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:50.580]   All my coworkers that I'm more got it.
[00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:51.740]   My two best friends got it.
[00:48:51.740 --> 00:48:55.460]   I have a couple other media pals who have them that will make a difference when others
[00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:56.460]   have it, right?
[00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:57.460]   Yeah.
[00:48:57.460 --> 00:48:58.460]   And we send sketches.
[00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:00.780]   Allie Kazmuho, one of our editors is playing tic-tac-toe.
[00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:02.140]   And it's not just a challenge game.
[00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:03.140]   It's a memory game.
[00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:04.140]   You've got to remember every move.
[00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:05.140]   Right.
[00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:06.140]   It doesn't preserve it.
[00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:07.140]   Yeah.
[00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:08.140]   So there's a lot of good stuff.
[00:49:08.140 --> 00:49:10.260]   Some of the stuff, like some of the bad stuff is again, like some of the fitness stuff.
[00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:12.860]   It tells me to stand when I'm already standing.
[00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:15.620]   It's I'm not sure how to adjust for an Ali's finding this to you.
[00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:18.340]   How to adjust for resistance when you're doing some of the training.
[00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:21.700]   And there are rough edges, but there's nothing like putting your product on a million people's
[00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:24.140]   wrists and getting a lot of feedback.
[00:49:24.140 --> 00:49:30.660]   And at the same iPhone from 2007, or the iPad from 2010 to today, they weren't really revolutionary.
[00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:32.380]   You kind of look back in hindsight.
[00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:34.980]   I think that's something you can only judge with time and space.
[00:49:34.980 --> 00:49:36.540]   But they were revolutionary at the time.
[00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:42.340]   I mean, multi-touch on a smartphone with a big screen, which was the first iPhone, was
[00:49:42.340 --> 00:49:44.540]   you would look at it and you'd go, yes, they got it.
[00:49:44.540 --> 00:49:48.460]   Well, some people are like, oh, it's just a big iPad or, oh, it's just in my field or
[00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:50.220]   my Blackberry does more than that.
[00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:51.220]   That's a point.
[00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:53.220]   I never felt that way.
[00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:57.940]   I guess the real question is, does this jump start the smartwatch category?
[00:49:57.940 --> 00:50:03.740]   I mean, however, millions in sales and 300 and 3,500 apps, it's going to do a lot to put
[00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:06.100]   it in people who didn't really even think about it before.
[00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:07.860]   And I think that I think Andy said this before.
[00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:12.220]   I think it really benefits Android Wear and Pebble and everybody too, because the awareness
[00:50:12.220 --> 00:50:13.220]   is so high.
[00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:14.700]   I like the choices Apple made.
[00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:20.300]   Like Apple is brand new to OLED and iOS 7 is a white white interface and they went dark.
[00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:21.540]   Material design is a white white interface.
[00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:24.580]   They stayed white white and I'm hoping they go dark too because I think there's a lot of
[00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:27.700]   things that we're going to have to do in the beginning to really maximize the potential
[00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:29.300]   of wrist software.
[00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:32.140]   And I feel like with both Apple and Google working on it, we'll get to that solution
[00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:33.340]   faster for everybody.
[00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:34.340]   Yeah.
[00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:35.340]   Yeah.
[00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:41.060]   And I agree because what people don't understand is that just that if all a smartwatch does
[00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:45.740]   is take notifications off of your phone and put them on your wrist, that in itself is
[00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:48.580]   a huge chunk of the wind of having a smartwatch.
[00:50:48.580 --> 00:50:52.940]   And there's not a whole lot that Apple Watch does in terms of the software, in terms of
[00:50:52.940 --> 00:50:56.940]   things it puts on the screen that Android Wear doesn't do.
[00:50:56.940 --> 00:51:04.540]   And there's the even the new version of Pebble isn't quite as ambitious as even Android Wear,
[00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:06.380]   but it's still a lot of that functionality.
[00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:09.580]   So it's very, very possible for someone to have a friend who has an Apple Watch and see
[00:51:09.580 --> 00:51:11.060]   how well that works.
[00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:16.100]   But then, hey, unfortunately, either a I don't have $400 to spend on a watch or I don't have
[00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:19.740]   an iPhone, they could then take a look at an Android Wear watch or look at Pebble and
[00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:23.700]   realize they're going to get much, if not most of that, on whatever device they use.
[00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:29.340]   So this really, they are doing wonderful education and PR for anybody who wants to create a wearable
[00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:31.460]   device.
[00:51:31.460 --> 00:51:34.540]   Tips for people who haven't got theirs yet but are about to.
[00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:39.180]   I know you and I more, you've done a great, you know, bunch of articles, including things
[00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:42.660]   like how does the heart rate sensor work on a tattooed forearm?
[00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:44.220]   That was so underneath this morning.
[00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:48.820]   She had high-annel ability tattoos to do a lot of testing.
[00:51:48.820 --> 00:51:50.820]   She tested on a roller derby team?
[00:51:50.820 --> 00:51:52.460]   Well, I mean, it's a thing.
[00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:55.580]   We saw it coming up on Twitter and Reddit today where people who had tattoos because
[00:51:55.580 --> 00:52:00.020]   Apple is using both a green LED and an infrared sensor to measure heart rate and the infrared
[00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:03.780]   is the passive one, the green LED is the active one and it'll switch depending on how much
[00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:04.780]   trouble it has.
[00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:08.260]   But if you have a tattoo on that exact spot and especially if it's really dark or it's
[00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:11.900]   really absorbed, or it's a color that readily absorbs that light, then you're going to get
[00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:15.700]   inaccurate readings and you have to either change your wrist or maybe heart rate's
[00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:17.100]   important to you.
[00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:20.820]   But we try to give people a lot of information if we can.
[00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:21.820]   Yeah.
[00:52:21.820 --> 00:52:28.400]   I'm going to add you to, let me ask you this because some of my, like Lisa is not showing
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:29.820]   up as an iPhone user.
[00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:33.660]   How do you, do you, how do you make sure that you are going to be able to, if your friend
[00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:36.420]   has an Apple watch, send them heart beats and drawings?
[00:52:36.420 --> 00:52:37.420]   It's the iMessage system.
[00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:43.260]   So if you have, in your contacts, if you have her iMessage, authenticated phone number or
[00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:48.460]   iCloud address or whatever address she uses for iCloud in there, then it should just work.
[00:52:48.460 --> 00:52:49.460]   Okay.
[00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:56.180]   So I just added Renee Ritchie by phone number, but I also had your email address.
[00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:57.540]   So that should be sufficient, right?
[00:52:57.540 --> 00:52:58.540]   Yes.
[00:52:58.540 --> 00:52:59.540]   Okay.
[00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:00.540]   And I will send you, I'm working on Darth Vader heads.
[00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:01.540]   They're not as good as the bad ones.
[00:53:01.540 --> 00:53:05.260]   Well, let me just, let me just, see, I've made you a friend because you have a lot of
[00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:06.500]   room for friends.
[00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:10.500]   It adds your favorites right away, but then you have room to add a few more.
[00:53:10.500 --> 00:53:12.300]   So I have a few more positions.
[00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:14.780]   So yes, I could see I could send you something.
[00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:19.380]   So I'm just going to send you that, which is a poor bad.
[00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:21.020]   Quick tip, just the finder icon.
[00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:22.100]   The finder, that's what I did.
[00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:24.580]   I send you the finder icon.
[00:53:24.580 --> 00:53:28.380]   Quick tip on the drawing thing because this didn't, wasn't readily apparent to me at first.
[00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:29.940]   You don't have to rush.
[00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:33.500]   Like I felt like, oh, I'm going to draw something and it's going to start sending before I even
[00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:34.500]   finish it.
[00:53:34.500 --> 00:53:35.500]   Right.
[00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:43.020]   So you can take a little time and, and, you know, spend a little time on your drawing.
[00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:47.020]   You don't have to rush it through or if you need to go, rego over a line to make it thicker
[00:53:47.020 --> 00:53:48.140]   or something like that.
[00:53:48.140 --> 00:53:49.140]   So that was a little.
[00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:50.140]   Take your time.
[00:53:50.140 --> 00:53:51.140]   Take a mistake.
[00:53:51.140 --> 00:53:54.420]   Tap the color picker because that'll, that'll stop the picture from sending.
[00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:55.700]   That's kind of a cool thing too.
[00:53:55.700 --> 00:53:57.940]   You can change the color that you send.
[00:53:57.940 --> 00:53:58.940]   Yeah.
[00:53:58.940 --> 00:54:03.460]   It's multiple colors yet though, unfortunately, right?
[00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:06.460]   Just occur to me that I, I don't have the reason why I would very much like to be Susan
[00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:08.460]   Care's friend is that I bet she does the most.
[00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:09.460]   She'd be very good at this.
[00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:10.460]   I'll watch sketches.
[00:54:10.460 --> 00:54:11.700]   Now I'm going to tell you one thing.
[00:54:11.700 --> 00:54:12.700]   I'm a lefty.
[00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:17.260]   So everything I draw, I'm drawing with my right hand, which means you're getting terrible
[00:54:17.260 --> 00:54:18.260]   drawings for me.
[00:54:18.260 --> 00:54:22.980]   Now I realize, oh, I know now why I don't, I don't find any useful for this for this.
[00:54:22.980 --> 00:54:25.700]   Now you can wear this on your right wrist.
[00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:28.820]   You have to flip it upside down, but there's a setting to say which wrist you're going to
[00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:30.820]   watch it use it on.
[00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:34.820]   You can, and you query it on the screen, I think I work with Jeff Gambit over the Mac
[00:54:34.820 --> 00:54:40.500]   Observer and when he went in for his fitting, they pointed out, you know, you probably want
[00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:43.900]   the digital crown pointed out towards your wrist because his first thing when he tried
[00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:47.620]   it on was to flip it around, which meant the digital crown was on the, you know, you had
[00:54:47.620 --> 00:54:49.220]   to reach across the face of the watch.
[00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:50.220]   Right.
[00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:52.520]   Well, and you don't want to reach across the face of the watch and obscure it when you're
[00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:53.640]   using the digital crown.
[00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:56.500]   So they thought of these things, which is nice.
[00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:58.180]   Thank you, Renee, for the Batman sketch.
[00:54:58.180 --> 00:55:01.340]   Well, and I apologize for the very poor sketches.
[00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:05.100]   So what you're saying is, uh, the best way to do this would be put it, because I can't
[00:55:05.100 --> 00:55:06.580]   draw with my right hand.
[00:55:06.580 --> 00:55:08.020]   So I should wear it on my right wrist.
[00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:11.940]   And you're saying just leave it the way like don't reorient it.
[00:55:11.940 --> 00:55:13.620]   Put the digital crown toward your wrist.
[00:55:13.620 --> 00:55:14.620]   You should.
[00:55:14.620 --> 00:55:15.620]   You're not going to reach it.
[00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:16.620]   Yeah.
[00:55:16.620 --> 00:55:17.620]   For your fingers, right?
[00:55:17.620 --> 00:55:18.620]   The digital crown should be pointing toward your finger.
[00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:19.620]   So it turned it around.
[00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:21.100]   In other words, yeah, I got it.
[00:55:21.100 --> 00:55:25.820]   This is just moving the wrist over, but I can also, if I wish, tell it I'm wearing it
[00:55:25.820 --> 00:55:29.260]   on my right wrist, which would mean that I can flip it upside down and it will flip
[00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:30.660]   the screen around so that it's oriented.
[00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:32.180]   So you think that's how I should do it?
[00:55:32.180 --> 00:55:36.220]   You can independently set that orientation and, uh, and the side that the digital crown
[00:55:36.220 --> 00:55:37.460]   is on is got settings for both.
[00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:38.460]   Oh, this independent.
[00:55:38.460 --> 00:55:39.460]   Yeah.
[00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:40.460]   That's, that's totally preference Leo.
[00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:44.660]   But the point was if you put the digital crown toward your sleeve, yeah, when you take
[00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:47.380]   your hand, you're going to be reaching to operate the digital crown, you're going to
[00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:48.380]   be rushing across the cross.
[00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:52.820]   It's the only weird thing about that way is the digital crowns on the bottom and the
[00:55:52.820 --> 00:55:53.820]   buttons on the top.
[00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:55.780]   So it becomes preference really at that point.
[00:55:55.780 --> 00:55:57.820]   And then some people have asked, can I wear it?
[00:55:57.820 --> 00:56:02.140]   And I think you can as some people do on the inside of the wrist, that's works fine too.
[00:56:02.140 --> 00:56:03.140]   Yes.
[00:56:03.140 --> 00:56:04.140]   Yep.
[00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:05.140]   Yeah.
[00:56:05.140 --> 00:56:06.140]   All right.
[00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:07.140]   So I'm going to try it.
[00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:12.060]   Now I realize if that I was just going to wear it like normal people do on my left arm,
[00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:15.820]   but I realize now that will, that will impede my drawing ability.
[00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:18.820]   So I'm, and now a lot, and this is another thing.
[00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:26.740]   You, you now have a reason for this crap icon on iOS eight, which is that a lot of what
[00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:29.180]   you do needs to be done on the phone.
[00:56:29.180 --> 00:56:30.180]   Yeah.
[00:56:30.180 --> 00:56:32.820]   Another tip that I'll comment on that wasn't obvious to me at first.
[00:56:32.820 --> 00:56:34.900]   You mentioned Apple Pay earlier, which I absolutely love.
[00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:36.700]   I've done Apple Pay on my watch.
[00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:41.460]   I used it day one at a Walgreens and it was, it went really quick.
[00:56:41.460 --> 00:56:44.060]   It worked really, really well.
[00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:48.980]   The UI for that's a little bit confusing because when you first go in to look at Passbook and
[00:56:48.980 --> 00:56:51.300]   Apple Pay at the top, it says mirror my phone.
[00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:52.300]   Right.
[00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:56.820]   And I thought that meant like all my cards were, I thought so too, you still have to
[00:56:56.820 --> 00:56:58.940]   add them from the watch interface.
[00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:00.060]   That was kind of a pain in the butt.
[00:57:00.060 --> 00:57:01.740]   And all the cards have to be added.
[00:57:01.740 --> 00:57:04.980]   Re-added or what's weird is you're still adding them on the phone.
[00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:05.980]   Right.
[00:57:05.980 --> 00:57:10.220]   But somebody said, oh, it's because the secure store on the iPhone can't communicate with
[00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:11.380]   the secure store on the app.
[00:57:11.380 --> 00:57:12.380]   Which makes sense.
[00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:14.540]   You need to have a separate secure store.
[00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:18.700]   Yet I'm still entering the cards on this phone and sending them to the watch.
[00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:20.380]   So I'm confused.
[00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:22.340]   But that is something you should be aware of.
[00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:23.340]   You're going to use Apple Pay.
[00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:28.460]   You need to completely set it up anew with all the cards on your watch separately.
[00:57:28.460 --> 00:57:33.700]   And that is nice to know that they have the same lock rules on the watch.
[00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:36.100]   At first I thought, oh, I'm not going to lock the watch.
[00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:39.620]   And they said, dude, if you don't lock the watch, you can't use Apple Pay because you'll
[00:57:39.620 --> 00:57:41.940]   be letting your credit cards go.
[00:57:41.940 --> 00:57:44.860]   So they make you lock the watch.
[00:57:44.860 --> 00:57:45.860]   It unlocks.
[00:57:45.860 --> 00:57:46.860]   You have various settings.
[00:57:46.860 --> 00:57:49.860]   But you will unlock when you use Touch ID on your phone.
[00:57:49.860 --> 00:57:53.620]   Then you don't have to worry about entering a four digit code on the watch.
[00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:59.020]   Or if you're Steve Gibson, you have a massive password that's unique to steer Apple.
[00:57:59.020 --> 00:58:04.820]   But then there also is the race watch if somebody gets it wrong 10 times feature, which I think
[00:58:04.820 --> 00:58:07.260]   that's a good thing to do too.
[00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:09.740]   So this is pretty impressive.
[00:58:09.740 --> 00:58:12.900]   So you can put it on left wrist, right wrist, digital crown on left side, digital crown
[00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:14.260]   on right side.
[00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:15.420]   So it really is.
[00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:18.100]   I mean, kudos to them on that.
[00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:22.500]   I'll tell you one thing that is I really didn't like.
[00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:26.860]   And I don't know if either of you have tried this sort of reorganizing your app icons on
[00:58:26.860 --> 00:58:27.860]   the app screen.
[00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:31.300]   I do not get what that game is all about.
[00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:33.260]   Some people are really into that.
[00:58:33.260 --> 00:58:37.740]   One of my coworkers, Ali, she has all of hers in a very thin vertical line.
[00:58:37.740 --> 00:58:39.540]   So all she has to do is scroll up and down with the crown.
[00:58:39.540 --> 00:58:40.540]   That's a good idea.
[00:58:40.540 --> 00:58:44.180]   Like getting it to take in a day to do that.
[00:58:44.180 --> 00:58:45.820]   Yeah, because they move around weird.
[00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:49.260]   If you get one next to another one, it pushes it down to, you know, it's like this game.
[00:58:49.260 --> 00:58:53.020]   There's a thread on Reddit with these great patterns, like ninja star patterns, all sorts
[00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:54.020]   of amazing.
[00:58:54.020 --> 00:58:55.820]   So you mean I could, I could like.
[00:58:55.820 --> 00:58:57.860]   Yeah, I arranged mine by color.
[00:58:57.860 --> 00:59:00.540]   So I have a pretty color for my eye color.
[00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:01.540]   That's a nice idea.
[00:59:01.540 --> 00:59:03.540]   Put all the green ones together.
[00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:05.060]   But doing it was like impossible.
[00:59:05.060 --> 00:59:06.540]   Yeah, because it's just popped up.
[00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:07.540]   Yeah.
[00:59:07.540 --> 00:59:08.540]   It's like a new game.
[00:59:08.540 --> 00:59:10.940]   You got to kind of put it at the end of the line.
[00:59:10.940 --> 00:59:14.540]   It seemed to work best for me, but I don't know.
[00:59:14.540 --> 00:59:16.100]   It's not easy.
[00:59:16.100 --> 00:59:17.100]   This is a game.
[00:59:17.100 --> 00:59:19.300]   We'll just make a game out of it.
[00:59:19.300 --> 00:59:22.780]   Now the other thing that happens now, I love the how this watch is simplifying your life
[00:59:22.780 --> 00:59:25.940]   and giving you more free to enjoy the world around you.
[00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:28.540]   Look, isn't that a great interface?
[00:59:28.540 --> 00:59:31.900]   So when we were skeptical about this interface, the moment we saw it, when they first showed
[00:59:31.900 --> 00:59:34.780]   it, I thought, is that really how I'm going to be?
[00:59:34.780 --> 00:59:38.900]   Unfortunately, Siri does work unless you're in a very noisy environment.
[00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:41.380]   And you can say, hey, what's your name?
[00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:42.700]   Yeah, see, there you go.
[00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:44.300]   The green one keeps popping up on you, right?
[00:59:44.300 --> 00:59:46.500]   Yeah, but it's a fun game.
[00:59:46.500 --> 00:59:48.980]   It's something to do in your spare time.
[00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:51.220]   It's also-- I mean, this is also a safety valve.
[00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:54.780]   You're really meant to react to notifications and to use Siri to launch applications.
[00:59:54.780 --> 00:59:55.780]   Right.
[00:59:55.780 --> 00:59:57.700]   But there are going to be some people who want to use it like an iPhone.
[00:59:57.700 --> 01:00:00.620]   The way some people use terminal on OS 10 or use an iPhone like a Mac.
[01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:01.620]   Don't.
[01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:02.620]   That's crazy.
[01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:03.620]   Don't.
[01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:04.620]   It drives yourself nuts.
[01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:05.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:00:05.620 --> 01:00:07.860]   Although, I like this idea of color bars.
[01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:08.860]   I'm not going to--
[01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:11.140]   I hold it not to install apps on my Apple Watch.
[01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:13.460]   OK, now in case my case basis, that's what I want to talk about.
[01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:14.460]   Really important.
[01:00:14.460 --> 01:00:15.460]   I think--
[01:00:15.460 --> 01:00:20.020]   So when you first set it up, it automatically takes every app that's on your phone.
[01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:21.020]   And if it has--
[01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:23.420]   And Apple Watch-- it does ask you.
[01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:24.420]   Yeah.
[01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:25.420]   Yes, say no.
[01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:29.340]   So it will, if you say yes, which I said, immediately install every app that's on your
[01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:32.820]   phone that has a watch interface on the watch.
[01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:33.820]   That's not what you want.
[01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:34.820]   I want to one by one.
[01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:36.340]   And I said, I want to remember, these aren't really apps.
[01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:37.340]   These are watch kit extensions.
[01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:38.340]   Right.
[01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:39.340]   So you can think of them almost like web apps.
[01:00:39.340 --> 01:00:42.180]   When you launch them at first, they'll take a while, then they'll cache to the device
[01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:44.060]   and they'll be faster if you use them frequently.
[01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:46.300]   They can be very slow the first time you launch them.
[01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:47.300]   Yeah.
[01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:48.300]   But you really want to pare down.
[01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:52.060]   You really want to figure out what do I want to know about on here.
[01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:53.260]   And the same goes with notifications.
[01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:56.700]   Say, you got to figure out your notifications, your glances.
[01:00:56.700 --> 01:01:02.220]   And I would say best advice is start with as few as you think you need and then--
[01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:03.220]   Add them.
[01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:04.220]   Yeah.
[01:01:04.220 --> 01:01:05.220]   Add them.
[01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:06.220]   And how do you add them?
[01:01:06.220 --> 01:01:08.660]   So they do every-- they all show up here, right?
[01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:09.660]   Yep.
[01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:10.660]   They're just in a long way.
[01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:11.660]   So you can decide.
[01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:15.140]   So first is I didn't want to use Twitter because Renee, my friend Renee Richie said,
[01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:17.140]   "Twitterific was so much better on the watch."
[01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:20.100]   It makes more sense to me because Twitter shows a timeline.
[01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:23.820]   They show what they want you to see, or Twitterific kind of shows me what I want to see.
[01:01:23.820 --> 01:01:24.820]   But you have the choice.
[01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:27.620]   You can not only show it on the watch and that's that grid, but you could decide whether you
[01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:29.460]   want to see it in glances.
[01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:33.700]   And in many cases, I don't think you want it in glances because glances can get un-unused.
[01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:34.700]   I haven't used it.
[01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:38.220]   I use glances for setting the settings out, the heartbeat, things that are really--
[01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:39.220]   Really?
[01:01:39.220 --> 01:01:40.220]   --that I hear down.
[01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:41.220]   Paired down your glances because otherwise--
[01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:42.420]   But I don't want to interact with it.
[01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:43.420]   I do like this.
[01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:45.700]   So I have the Audible app running on the phone.
[01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:47.780]   I was listening to my book.
[01:01:47.780 --> 01:01:49.420]   It-- no, where's my button?
[01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:51.780]   Yeah, see, I missed you up now because I made you flip it over.
[01:01:51.780 --> 01:01:53.700]   It's on the top.
[01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:56.020]   That's why I said you have to decide what you like.
[01:01:56.020 --> 01:01:57.020]   I know I'm going to get used to this.
[01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:59.820]   --and the bottom and the button on the top or the other way around.
[01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:05.620]   As a lefty, I've always worn my watches as normal people do on my left wrist because
[01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:06.980]   you want to wind it and stuff.
[01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:09.300]   But now I realize for drawing that's untenable.
[01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:12.100]   So I think I'm going to have to get used to wearing a watch on my right wrist.
[01:02:12.100 --> 01:02:13.100]   But this is nice.
[01:02:13.100 --> 01:02:16.740]   So it controls whatever audio was playing back on your phone.
[01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:19.340]   Yeah, podcast, audio books, music, and that's great.
[01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:23.180]   So it didn't mean an Audible app for me to be able to control my Audible.
[01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:26.140]   And if I press play, it comes on on the phone.
[01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:31.100]   You can also have it in some cases, playback on the watch, right?
[01:02:31.100 --> 01:02:34.660]   Do you have to decide which Audible does not because it ain't having that?
[01:02:34.660 --> 01:02:37.140]   You can sync up to two gigabytes of your music library.
[01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:39.580]   But music is a playback from the whole media speaker there.
[01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:41.180]   You pick up playlist.
[01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:45.300]   So you set up a playlist and then you choose that as the one that you want to sync.
[01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:47.020]   So you'd have a playlist in your music app?
[01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:51.500]   Yeah, and I believe that you select it from the watch, some from the music settings in
[01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:53.220]   the watch app, I believe.
[01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:54.300]   I haven't done it yet.
[01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:55.300]   I haven't either.
[01:02:55.300 --> 01:02:56.300]   It has six gigs.
[01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:57.940]   It has a decent amount of storage.
[01:02:57.940 --> 01:02:58.940]   Yeah.
[01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:02.140]   So it's in the music app in the watch app.
[01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:04.300]   You choose which playlist you'd like to sync.
[01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:09.060]   Showing how it's good because that gives me the capability, not just with music, but
[01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:11.780]   whatever is playing to control it on the watch.
[01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:12.780]   Sync to playlists.
[01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:16.220]   So now I can say, oh, let me play back my gym music.
[01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:17.660]   That's a logical thing, right?
[01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:19.580]   As if I had gym music.
[01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:23.460]   And then playlist limit, you can even set the limit of the amount of storage you want.
[01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:25.900]   It can't be any more than two.
[01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:28.620]   Or you could say how many songs up to 250.
[01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:30.420]   And then you'll need Bluetooth headphones.
[01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:31.620]   You won't actually hear it.
[01:03:31.620 --> 01:03:34.020]   Oh, it doesn't come out of the little speaker?
[01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:37.620]   No, not that that would be very good, but all right.
[01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:39.340]   That I don't know.
[01:03:39.340 --> 01:03:41.540]   I don't think so.
[01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:46.060]   I, you know, when you look at stuff like this, it's clear that they've been spending a lot
[01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:51.260]   of this is a lot of work, a lot of time, a lot of thought, and a lot of beta testing,
[01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:53.700]   because in many ways this is very nice and elegant.
[01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:55.540]   And I do give one of the kudos for that.
[01:03:55.540 --> 01:03:59.100]   One of the really cool things is when you first get it, if you want to take it out for
[01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:02.900]   running by itself, they suggest you use the iPhone with it for a couple of days, because
[01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:07.260]   it'll, it'll, it'll match the GPS information to what the watch is modeling is showing it.
[01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:10.540]   And just make sure to adjust it for your stride, your activity level.
[01:04:10.540 --> 01:04:13.900]   And then the accuracy will be even better when you take the watch out by itself.
[01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:14.900]   Clever.
[01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:15.900]   Yeah.
[01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:16.900]   This is good.
[01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:21.220]   We're getting some good tips for those of you who are waiting for your watch to arrive.
[01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:26.020]   Are you guys, we have four people in the studio audience, all getting watches?
[01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:27.020]   Yes.
[01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:28.020]   Yes.
[01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:29.020]   Next year.
[01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:30.980]   Next year, smart and never.
[01:04:30.980 --> 01:04:31.980]   Okay.
[01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:37.100]   I'm wondering if next year we'll have a case only option.
[01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:39.700]   Like for people who already have all the straps that they want or the bands that they want,
[01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:40.700]   they just got the case.
[01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:41.700]   That would be.
[01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:45.060]   So I did not scratch somebody saying Leo scratch screen.
[01:04:45.060 --> 01:04:47.500]   It looked like a scratch, but it was just a smudge.
[01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:49.940]   So as far as I can tell, the screen is not scratched.
[01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:53.140]   Now we have seen people break the sport watch screen.
[01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:56.860]   This is the steel and the addition have a sapphire display.
[01:04:56.860 --> 01:04:58.460]   Mate said some interesting things though.
[01:04:58.460 --> 01:05:00.060]   You know, they test these displays.
[01:05:00.060 --> 01:05:04.500]   They said you're getting the best screen if you add them on your sport watch because
[01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:10.780]   that screen is using the same kind of glass that they use on the iPhone, which is better
[01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:16.500]   looking gives you richer blacks and so forth and better and bright light as well than the
[01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:17.500]   sapphire.
[01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:21.020]   It reduces the screen.
[01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:23.380]   I was thought the transparency of sapphire was.
[01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:25.140]   Yeah, I thought so too.
[01:05:25.140 --> 01:05:28.340]   It's a and I have to say this is very legible.
[01:05:28.340 --> 01:05:29.340]   Look how cool.
[01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:30.340]   I mean, that's really easy.
[01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:32.140]   Yeah, we got amazing display.
[01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:33.140]   Yeah.
[01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:36.580]   We got Greg Koenig from Luma Labs to do a whole thing on material, Apple's material design
[01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:37.580]   for us.
[01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:40.380]   And he was explaining and I didn't know that that there really are trade offs and everything.
[01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:44.620]   Like sapphire is more scratch resistant, but it doesn't it doesn't bend as much as the
[01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:47.420]   ion exchange glass does on the iPhone.
[01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:51.860]   So everyone who thinks like, you know, there's just one great answer to materials that everyone
[01:05:51.860 --> 01:05:53.780]   would just be using those materials.
[01:05:53.780 --> 01:05:54.780]   They really are trade offs.
[01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:55.780]   There's no perfect.
[01:05:55.780 --> 01:05:56.780]   Yeah.
[01:05:56.780 --> 01:05:57.780]   Yeah.
[01:05:57.780 --> 01:05:58.780]   Well, it also saves you money.
[01:05:58.780 --> 01:06:03.300]   I presume making it with glass not a he was amazed at how well the aluminum and held up.
[01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:04.300]   He thought that it would be bad.
[01:06:04.300 --> 01:06:07.060]   He went to the lot of Apple retail stores and checked and he was amazed at how well after
[01:06:07.060 --> 01:06:10.100]   10 days of try-ons the aluminum casing is held up.
[01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:12.500]   Some people are saying they're getting scratches and they're stainless steel.
[01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:14.940]   That doesn't seem well.
[01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:15.940]   It's like any stainless steel.
[01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:20.140]   I've had stainless steel watches before and the bands will scratch, but you can any watch
[01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:22.420]   make or anyone who knows how to take offs it out.
[01:06:22.420 --> 01:06:23.420]   Yeah.
[01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:26.500]   I have to say I've never had to watch the denick after a while.
[01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:27.500]   Right?
[01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:30.060]   I mean, that's just what happens.
[01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:35.620]   So which face do you fellas like I was just showing the really cool astronomy face.
[01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:39.340]   But the problem with something like this is you don't get as many complications as little
[01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:41.700]   informational windows.
[01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:45.220]   So you can't see for instance, but I do love this.
[01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:47.700]   I mean, this is just a show off display.
[01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:48.700]   Yeah.
[01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:52.460]   Here's the moon and I can actually go see the dark side of the moon and verify that Adam
[01:06:52.460 --> 01:06:53.460]   Curry's wrong.
[01:06:53.460 --> 01:06:57.340]   There is no secret US military base on the back there.
[01:06:57.340 --> 01:07:00.100]   And let's press this again.
[01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:01.860]   Is anybody using Mickey?
[01:07:01.860 --> 01:07:02.860]   I do on weekends.
[01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:03.860]   I'm using modern weekends.
[01:07:03.860 --> 01:07:04.860]   That's one week in.
[01:07:04.860 --> 01:07:05.860]   That's one week in.
[01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:06.860]   I think we can.
[01:07:06.860 --> 01:07:07.860]   Back to Greek.
[01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:11.140]   You use the ugly you use the ugly info face.
[01:07:11.140 --> 01:07:15.780]   I use it for work because when I actually working, it has so much information density.
[01:07:15.780 --> 01:07:18.940]   And then immediately when my day ends, I switch to like one of the cool butterfly or Mickey
[01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:19.940]   Mouse.
[01:07:19.940 --> 01:07:20.940]   Yeah.
[01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:22.100]   Is that the I'm using them?
[01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:23.300]   Is that the modular one?
[01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:24.300]   Yes.
[01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:25.300]   Yes.
[01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:26.300]   That's the one I use as well.
[01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:27.300]   Really?
[01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:30.300]   It's the most information sort of on one screen.
[01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:32.740]   Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:33.740]   Yeah.
[01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:36.620]   I don't know if I'd say it's cool.
[01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:38.580]   I like utility because I think it's.
[01:07:38.580 --> 01:07:40.820]   I did color match it to my band, which was nice.
[01:07:40.820 --> 01:07:41.820]   That's nice.
[01:07:41.820 --> 01:07:46.860]   Utility is a good looking watch face that does give me a lot of information battery life.
[01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:48.860]   I'm using a UTC.
[01:07:48.860 --> 01:07:50.260]   I have my calendar.
[01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:51.260]   You tap your calendar.
[01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:52.740]   You'll get it.
[01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:55.820]   And all of these are somewhat customizable and some degree.
[01:07:55.820 --> 01:07:58.500]   I'm doing a different one every day just so I can try them all.
[01:07:58.500 --> 01:07:59.500]   It's fun.
[01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:02.860]   You know, I've this is nice because you can take this utility and you can simplify the
[01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:08.200]   face or you can complexify the face depending on how many little, you know, how you're
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:12.140]   how you feel given that they're not allowing custom faces.
[01:08:12.140 --> 01:08:14.460]   They've done a pretty nice job, I think.
[01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:22.300]   And I predict WWDC or sometimes soon that some point there may be a watch face API that
[01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:23.620]   developers can start to.
[01:08:23.620 --> 01:08:28.700]   Groober makes it a good case for this that because of the OLED and battery life, you
[01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:32.580]   don't want to just kind of willy nilly random and besides Steve would hate it if somebody
[01:08:32.580 --> 01:08:34.460]   put an ugly face in this watch.
[01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:36.940]   Yeah, I was having a couple of days so badly.
[01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:39.860]   I was having some discussions with that on with some people on Twitter a couple of weeks
[01:08:39.860 --> 01:08:46.220]   ago because on Android where it actually took Google until October before they released
[01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:49.020]   the APIs for developers to create their own watch faces.
[01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:51.900]   And to me, that was one of the most brilliant things that happened to Android where because
[01:08:51.900 --> 01:08:56.460]   not only was it developers creating new watch faces, but also developers creating Android
[01:08:56.460 --> 01:09:00.420]   apps that let users create their own watch faces and you can do pretty much anything.
[01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:06.780]   And now there's a watch face repo or two where you can see every single user created watch
[01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:08.980]   face that somebody decided to share.
[01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:12.460]   One of my favorite ones is just it says the time underneath has a test.
[01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:16.780]   No, this isn't a bleeping Apple watch.
[01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:20.980]   And so this lets us some discussions about people saying, well, would Apple allow somebody
[01:09:20.980 --> 01:09:24.180]   to put an ugly face on the watch?
[01:09:24.180 --> 01:09:25.980]   And that's an interesting thing.
[01:09:25.980 --> 01:09:31.580]   I think the technical problems of creating a watch kit, a watch face kit are bigger than
[01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:33.940]   whatever aesthetic concerns they might have.
[01:09:33.940 --> 01:09:37.380]   But it's an interesting thing because if you if you can imagine one company saying, no,
[01:09:37.380 --> 01:09:42.180]   we want approval on watch face design because we don't want here's a big here's the here's
[01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:45.920]   the crap emoji and flies buzzing around to tell you what time it is.
[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:47.220]   We don't want that on our watch.
[01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:49.900]   We put so much time and effort into this.
[01:09:49.900 --> 01:09:53.940]   But nonetheless, that's one of the things you do to a smartwatch that makes it really
[01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:56.580]   yours, but it's the same thing with the Pebble watch.
[01:09:56.580 --> 01:10:02.420]   People just love their their kitty cat watch face where their Star Trek Elkhars watch face.
[01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:07.580]   It's something that takes this thing that is that a millions of people have and makes
[01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:08.580]   it uniquely yours.
[01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:12.620]   And I think that's something that really creates intimacy and a connection to the product.
[01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:14.580]   So I can't wait for that to happen for Apple watch.
[01:10:14.580 --> 01:10:16.300]   Yeah, Apple like that too.
[01:10:16.300 --> 01:10:20.180]   Which one do you use a jellyfish flowers or butterfly Renee?
[01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:21.180]   I like them all.
[01:10:21.180 --> 01:10:24.260]   I'm trying to do a different one every day so I get a sense of it.
[01:10:24.260 --> 01:10:27.100]   I wish you could have a completely random choice.
[01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:31.140]   Just to Andy's point there were back in March there were two additional not back in March
[01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:32.860]   before March there were two additional faces.
[01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:37.340]   There was time lapse which had like photographs of big Ben moving slowly through time.
[01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:40.860]   And there was a custom photo one where you could pick any photo from the photo library
[01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:45.460]   and those they just they didn't hold up well lighting up that many pixels in OLED battery
[01:10:45.460 --> 01:10:46.460]   performance they preferred.
[01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:47.980]   Yeah, notice how much black there is.
[01:10:47.980 --> 01:10:53.260]   I mean that's the key on OLED is anything that's not that's black that's not lit up is not using
[01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:54.260]   juice.
[01:10:54.260 --> 01:10:58.060]   Yeah, well again I mean there could be a version to this could be when they figure it out.
[01:10:58.060 --> 01:11:04.500]   I think the ultimate deciding factor for Apple is going to be 30% of every watch face sale.
[01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:09.180]   You know, and you know what what people can get faces even if at a buck apiece.
[01:11:09.180 --> 01:11:11.940]   Yeah, you're going to be downloading hundreds of them.
[01:11:11.940 --> 01:11:15.060]   And you can't buy watch apps right now you can only use their only extensions so they
[01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:16.580]   come for free with the app.
[01:11:16.580 --> 01:11:21.420]   What is your experience with battery at this point?
[01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:23.940]   Mine gets through the day no problem.
[01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:27.820]   On roaming on AT&T was hard but that's hard for my iPhone too.
[01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:30.060]   Once I got home everything was really really good.
[01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:34.140]   Did it impact your iPhone battery life too?
[01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:38.020]   It's hard to tell it's basically it's using Bluetooth LE as much as a Canada only escalate
[01:11:38.020 --> 01:11:41.900]   to Wi-Fi if the amount of data is significant and it needs to raise to sleep or if there's
[01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:44.140]   some problem with Bluetooth.
[01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:45.740]   So it's going to use Bluetooth LE.
[01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:48.140]   Bluetooth LE is incredibly power efficient but it's still a radio.
[01:11:48.140 --> 01:11:52.620]   So if that if you never have Bluetooth on and now suddenly you have it on and it's communicating
[01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:54.540]   it's going to be using more power.
[01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:58.100]   How much you use your watch and how much you use apps and how much you use hand off.
[01:11:58.100 --> 01:11:59.420]   The Apple watch can hand off Siri.
[01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:02.940]   It can hand off all sorts of things that even iPhones and things can't do.
[01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:06.700]   So it's going to be entirely up to your usage but it should be it should be analogous to
[01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:10.140]   any other Bluetooth device that you're using for the same amount of time.
[01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:16.020]   Mine's been good so far except one day and it was a day I did a 30 minute workout and
[01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:19.620]   something odd happened when I when I finished that workout I went to take off the watch
[01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:23.020]   and the green LEDs were stuck on for some reason.
[01:12:23.020 --> 01:12:25.860]   Yeah and I had to reboot the watch to sort of work.
[01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:28.820]   Yeah I even had to shut it down I think reboot didn't even do it.
[01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:31.820]   So I don't know if something happened with sensors there to kind of throw them off and
[01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:35.900]   they got stuck and that green the battery extra.
[01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:40.420]   And then also I had one sort of app that was doing a lot of notifications I was getting
[01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:44.540]   a lot of notifications so I disabled that and then since then it's been great you know
[01:12:44.540 --> 01:12:50.900]   I can get very much to the end of the day with you know 30 40% battery life seems like.
[01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:55.700]   That tracks for instance with my experience with the Moto 360 hated it after the first
[01:12:55.700 --> 01:13:00.500]   day I liked it after the first weekend and after two weeks after everything had been
[01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:04.620]   dialed in the way that I like it and I learned how to use it I that's when I started okay
[01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:05.980]   this is good gonna keep this.
[01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:11.380]   Yeah I had the same experience to it took a little while to appreciate the value.
[01:13:11.380 --> 01:13:18.620]   This does let's see so battery life acceptable charging fast charges in like an hour and
[01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:23.020]   hour and a half fully from zero to 60 just when bought all the cables they have the in
[01:13:23.020 --> 01:13:28.220]   candidates one meter and two meters I'm guessing that's three and six feet in the US.
[01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:32.180]   And you get the nice I have it here you get the nice steel version when you buy them
[01:13:32.180 --> 01:13:36.580]   at retail the stand was by the way those cables will charge your Moto 360 so that's another
[01:13:36.580 --> 01:13:37.580]   benefit.
[01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:38.580]   Yeah.
[01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:42.220]   Apparently Apple is using something that's compatible with Qi charging so must be using
[01:13:42.220 --> 01:13:43.220]   Qi.
[01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:47.100]   Has anybody tried I would suggest you try this go on Amazon and buy one of those $10
[01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:50.100]   little like Qi charging pads to see if it works.
[01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:54.020]   I have not been able to do in the other direction I have tons of Qi chargers everywhere.
[01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:55.020]   Okay.
[01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:58.740]   Doesn't want well it's it's tough because positioning as you know with Qi is tricky
[01:13:58.740 --> 01:14:05.860]   you got to match the induction engine on the device to the inducer on the charger.
[01:14:05.860 --> 01:14:08.700]   That's the nice thing about the way they've done it with a watch because of the magnet
[01:14:08.700 --> 01:14:11.860]   it just goes to the walk and it's perfect every time.
[01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:17.540]   I have yet to even with moving this around find a place that I can charge the watch it
[01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:19.700]   does go in the other direction though so much.
[01:14:19.700 --> 01:14:24.700]   That's weird because I have the I I'd have it here but I just came back from a trip and
[01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:28.820]   so it's in my travel bag I do have like a little silver dollar sized pad that I travel
[01:14:28.820 --> 01:14:33.180]   with to charge the watch with and it does it's easy to hit the target also you can buy
[01:14:33.180 --> 01:14:37.180]   these pads that actually have three coils in them so that no matter where you put it
[01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:39.180]   it's probably going to be close to someplace.
[01:14:39.180 --> 01:14:40.180]   Yeah.
[01:14:40.180 --> 01:14:45.580]   But I'm curious to see if Apple has made this a Apple only charging stand party or because
[01:14:45.580 --> 01:14:52.500]   because I really do like I've used smart watches where there's some sort of a magnetic connector
[01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:56.860]   and it's fine there's nothing bad about it but there's something about I took my watch
[01:14:56.860 --> 01:15:00.700]   off I simply dropped it on the nightstand and that's all I had to do with it that makes
[01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:02.420]   it kind of a little bit cooler.
[01:15:02.420 --> 01:15:04.740]   This is pretty easy.
[01:15:04.740 --> 01:15:06.020]   You just go flock.
[01:15:06.020 --> 01:15:09.820]   It's a very satisfying flock.
[01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:12.940]   What else anything else we want to tell people before they get their ones.
[01:15:12.940 --> 01:15:17.940]   The downside with the inductive charges with an iPhone I have a mophie power station I can
[01:15:17.940 --> 01:15:20.340]   just plug it in put it in my pocket walk around.
[01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:24.340]   The inductive stuff never stays in one place long enough so I stick it on walk put it in
[01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:27.740]   my pocket walk around it never really gets dislodged and I don't charge and I become
[01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:28.740]   sad.
[01:15:28.740 --> 01:15:35.340]   I bet someone's going to make a like an Altoids hack where it has an induction charger inside
[01:15:35.340 --> 01:15:39.340]   it and pluses like a shape of foam insert that keeps it held in the right place you simply
[01:15:39.340 --> 01:15:42.580]   close it plug it into your battery pack and it will work.
[01:15:42.580 --> 01:15:47.020]   I should make that for actually make that for the Moto 360 and you're brilliant I'm
[01:15:47.020 --> 01:15:48.020]   going to do that right now.
[01:15:48.020 --> 01:15:53.460]   Somebody said they should 3D somebody should get a 3D printer and make a holder for the
[01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:59.460]   flock thing and then you could flock it into a like easel holder or something like that.
[01:15:59.460 --> 01:16:04.100]   I've already I've already seen a whole bunch of people on Kickstarter and even with their
[01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:09.860]   own we've got the here's the here's the beautiful oiled walnuts desk stand or the beautiful
[01:16:09.860 --> 01:16:13.740]   nightstand holder that's going to let you use it as a timepiece while you're trying
[01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:16.460]   to fall asleep but you're being distracted by notifications.
[01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:20.180]   Steve and his trying to draw something right on my wrist now I don't know what the heck
[01:16:20.180 --> 01:16:21.180]   that is.
[01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:26.900]   Oh you missed it let's read how do you replay you can't it's ephemeral like it's not.
[01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:27.900]   Whatever.
[01:16:27.900 --> 01:16:28.900]   Yep.
[01:16:28.900 --> 01:16:35.460]   Oh man by the way try force touch because even in notifications force touch has miss it's
[01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:39.060]   like kind of right click always try for instance this clears all notifications.
[01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:40.700]   Yeah that's a good tip as well.
[01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:43.740]   I want that on the iPhone force touch yes I do too.
[01:16:43.740 --> 01:16:46.140]   They still don't have a clear all huh.
[01:16:46.140 --> 01:16:47.940]   Oh drives me crazy.
[01:16:47.940 --> 01:16:49.140]   This is nice too.
[01:16:49.140 --> 01:16:53.580]   The first glance gives you a chance to ping your iPhone if you lose it.
[01:16:53.580 --> 01:16:57.740]   It'll make little sounds on your iPhone I like that.
[01:16:57.740 --> 01:17:01.460]   And of course you have controls for airplane sleep and mute.
[01:17:01.460 --> 01:17:05.020]   The mute one's very important too you're going to go and do a movie or something.
[01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:07.580]   Why that's what I was going to ask you what do you think of Taptic now now that we've
[01:17:07.580 --> 01:17:12.980]   had some to me it's like oh this is an example of how Apple has been so good at marketing
[01:17:12.980 --> 01:17:19.700]   the scribeings it's not just vibration it's a traffic it's just vibration kids as someone
[01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:22.780]   who gets embarrassed when his phone like if I'm talking to somebody especially somebody
[01:17:22.780 --> 01:17:26.460]   in a social situation in my pocket is vibrating I find it very embarrassing.
[01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:29.340]   So I don't care what they call it as long as they make it so that I can feel it and
[01:17:29.340 --> 01:17:31.980]   nobody else can hear it I'm really in favor of it.
[01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:36.460]   Yeah it's great on with the maps app when coupled with the maps app I've been doing
[01:17:36.460 --> 01:17:41.300]   some driving and having the tap I've used it coming left and right is pretty neat but
[01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:44.700]   it's not like we should make this clear I thought it was going to be like at the left
[01:17:44.700 --> 01:17:46.660]   side of the watch with that.
[01:17:46.660 --> 01:17:48.940]   It's like it's different patterns.
[01:17:48.940 --> 01:17:49.940]   Yes.
[01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:53.220]   It's really just a vibration come on admit it.
[01:17:53.220 --> 01:17:58.140]   It's not noisy though it's not the vibration it's the whether other people hear it or not.
[01:17:58.140 --> 01:18:01.580]   You're right but that's because it's not sitting on a table it's resting on your cushy little
[01:18:01.580 --> 01:18:02.580]   arm.
[01:18:02.580 --> 01:18:04.420]   Well it won't be as static if it's on a table.
[01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:08.780]   Alright to me it has more of a what I call a thunk to it you know it's more like a.
[01:18:08.780 --> 01:18:09.780]   There's an attack.
[01:18:09.780 --> 01:18:10.780]   Yeah.
[01:18:10.780 --> 01:18:13.660]   It's not just quite like a slightly percussive attack.
[01:18:13.660 --> 01:18:18.060]   My pebble buzzes and it buzzes you know and it's pretty jolting.
[01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:21.580]   This is much more subtle takes a little getting used to as well.
[01:18:21.580 --> 01:18:25.700]   You know you might at first I noticed I would miss miss certain taps because it can be that
[01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:31.940]   subtle that you sort of adapt to it and it I would say it's different than a vibrate.
[01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:33.500]   Okay.
[01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:34.500]   For me I don't know.
[01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:35.500]   Yeah.
[01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:36.500]   It's a good sensation.
[01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:41.140]   It's a little bit muted so I also get a piercing little yelp when it vibrates.
[01:18:41.140 --> 01:18:43.060]   It turns that off three seconds.
[01:18:43.060 --> 01:18:46.700]   Turn the sound can get yeah annoying if you don't need them.
[01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:48.860]   It's a little piercing.
[01:18:48.860 --> 01:18:49.860]   But you hear it.
[01:18:49.860 --> 01:18:52.020]   It works it works that way.
[01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:55.060]   And Srenity also turned off the twist your wrist to turn on the screen because she found
[01:18:55.060 --> 01:18:57.740]   that she really from the theater she gestured a lot and she was getting a lot of false
[01:18:57.740 --> 01:18:58.740]   problems.
[01:18:58.740 --> 01:18:59.740]   Yeah.
[01:18:59.740 --> 01:19:00.740]   Now remember people could play this is not the ideal movie watch.
[01:19:00.740 --> 01:19:04.820]   The only way to dim it is to cover it with your hand and then it goes silent.
[01:19:04.820 --> 01:19:09.380]   And so apparently it will at random moments light up the movie.
[01:19:09.380 --> 01:19:12.540]   If you put it in the store for movies it's recommended.
[01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:13.540]   That's what it's recommended.
[01:19:13.540 --> 01:19:16.900]   I bet that they're going to take a page for mandroid where because that was one of the
[01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:20.340]   first editions they made because they got the exact same complaint and now there is if
[01:19:20.340 --> 01:19:23.700]   you swipe down a movie book that the call in theater mode where it still works but you
[01:19:23.700 --> 01:19:27.140]   have to actually push the clicky button the light of the screen.
[01:19:27.140 --> 01:19:30.100]   So how does the Rennity light up the screen she pushes the button every time?
[01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:31.100]   Yes.
[01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:32.860]   Well she taps the screen or taps it.
[01:19:32.860 --> 01:19:33.860]   Yeah.
[01:19:33.860 --> 01:19:35.180]   So it's a better battery life that way too.
[01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:36.180]   Yes.
[01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:37.180]   That's another advantage.
[01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:39.860]   All that is really good but not letting up a screen is always better than life.
[01:19:39.860 --> 01:19:40.860]   Yeah.
[01:19:40.860 --> 01:19:41.860]   Yeah.
[01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:42.860]   Okay I'm going to have to try that.
[01:19:42.860 --> 01:19:45.700]   Yeah it doesn't take that much extra effort to tap the screen I found.
[01:19:45.700 --> 01:19:48.340]   So I'm probably going to move to that as well just for battery life.
[01:19:48.340 --> 01:19:53.020]   It's more positive too and I've had the same problem with Android where we're at first
[01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:56.500]   and Annie I think you were the one that told me I was doing it really hard.
[01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:57.500]   Yeah.
[01:19:57.500 --> 01:19:58.500]   And that was confusing it.
[01:19:58.500 --> 01:19:59.980]   It's just a little bit like this.
[01:19:59.980 --> 01:20:01.660]   Apple watch seems to be better at doing that.
[01:20:01.660 --> 01:20:02.660]   I mean I don't.
[01:20:02.660 --> 01:20:07.020]   It's interesting how you find if you're enjoying the experience of using a product you find
[01:20:07.020 --> 01:20:10.260]   yourself learning new skills and new muscle memory.
[01:20:10.260 --> 01:20:16.340]   And when I have the Moto on yes I can activate by turning it but now when I raise my wrist
[01:20:16.340 --> 01:20:19.340]   if I have my other hand free I just sort of not thinkingly just tap the screen so it's
[01:20:19.340 --> 01:20:21.060]   instantly available.
[01:20:21.060 --> 01:20:25.460]   And when I get the information I put my hand over to sleep it immediately just like
[01:20:25.460 --> 01:20:27.180]   snapping a pocket watch closed.
[01:20:27.180 --> 01:20:30.780]   It's like it's not I have to do that it's just that well why it's just the habit that
[01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:33.780]   I got into and it's not inconvenient in the least.
[01:20:33.780 --> 01:20:37.740]   So as I said before it's going to be very interesting to talk to people after they've
[01:20:37.740 --> 01:20:42.700]   been wearing it for a month and they realize that they have adapted to the watch and the
[01:20:42.700 --> 01:20:45.740]   watch has adapted to them and it's probably going to be a much better experience for them
[01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:47.900]   than it was on the first weekend.
[01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:50.740]   I do recommend iMOR's 28.
[01:20:50.740 --> 01:20:55.220]   Serenity wrote this Apple watch tips and tricks you should know if you want more there's
[01:20:55.220 --> 01:20:57.380]   lots of good ones in here.
[01:20:57.380 --> 01:21:01.740]   I have yet to use power reserve mode haven't had to it's gone all the way.
[01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:05.540]   I hit it that one day the one thing you need to know about power reserve is when it's on
[01:21:05.540 --> 01:21:09.780]   that it will not do the raise to to wake thing you do have to tap the button.
[01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:12.820]   Yeah and you have to be put a tip together.
[01:21:12.820 --> 01:21:19.180]   The important tip is doubt exercise because if you doubt exercise then you'll have battery
[01:21:19.180 --> 01:21:20.340]   life or dialogue.
[01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:23.940]   I also love it and I did not know this thank you Serenity there you could do a screenshot
[01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:30.980]   much like you do on the iPhone by pressing both buttons at the same time.
[01:21:30.980 --> 01:21:31.980]   Has anybody.
[01:21:31.980 --> 01:21:32.980]   There you go.
[01:21:32.980 --> 01:21:37.140]   Has anybody sent you any of those creepy 3D emojis?
[01:21:37.140 --> 01:21:42.780]   Yes quite a lot and you know when I first saw those it just it just screamed Yahoo from
[01:21:42.780 --> 01:21:43.780]   the 90s.
[01:21:43.780 --> 01:21:46.260]   Yeah and like boy those guys like tongues a lot.
[01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:49.100]   Yeah but you like it huh.
[01:21:49.100 --> 01:21:52.420]   No I mean I'm still not a huge fan of them like I think the hands move too little and
[01:21:52.420 --> 01:21:54.980]   the faces move too much but you know it's general.
[01:21:54.980 --> 01:21:58.340]   Because there's a thing if Apple does exactly the same thing every year we say they're boring
[01:21:58.340 --> 01:21:59.340]   and not innovating.
[01:21:59.340 --> 01:22:02.940]   If they do new things we say they're doing silly things and I think you need to experiment
[01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:05.420]   and some of it I'm not going to like and I'm okay with that.
[01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:08.580]   To Andy's point earlier you know like when you when you love somebody everything about
[01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:12.300]   them you find is desirable when you hate somebody you dislike it.
[01:22:12.300 --> 01:22:15.620]   So if you have a good experience you find the next one delightful or informative you have
[01:22:15.620 --> 01:22:17.980]   a bad one you get more and more frustrated.
[01:22:17.980 --> 01:22:21.460]   So I'm trying to keep this balance depending on where I'm just noting I don't like that
[01:22:21.460 --> 01:22:24.900]   do like this without letting it sort of emotionally affect me too much.
[01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:25.900]   Yeah nice.
[01:22:25.900 --> 01:22:29.900]   Something that impressed me about the emojis and I'm not a big Jason I'm showing the emojis
[01:22:29.900 --> 01:22:30.900]   here.
[01:22:30.900 --> 01:22:35.780]   And I'm not a big fan of them myself is I was impressed that when you send them to someone
[01:22:35.780 --> 01:22:40.260]   who doesn't have a watch or a phone they are still animated at least on iMessage side I
[01:22:40.260 --> 01:22:41.260]   don't I haven't seen it.
[01:22:41.260 --> 01:22:43.540]   Yeah well they're animated GIFs so they work everywhere.
[01:22:43.540 --> 01:22:44.540]   Yeah yeah.
[01:22:44.540 --> 01:22:46.740]   Not as well they're not as creepy.
[01:22:46.740 --> 01:22:48.940]   They're creepy everywhere Leo.
[01:22:48.940 --> 01:22:51.180]   They're pretty creepy.
[01:22:51.180 --> 01:22:53.700]   It's uncanny valley creepy is what it is.
[01:22:53.700 --> 01:22:57.300]   They're just I mean and so it's funny because a lot of people were saying Apple was too
[01:22:57.300 --> 01:23:01.100]   flat but now here you have button borders in a lot of places again you have 3D rendered
[01:23:01.100 --> 01:23:02.100]   textures.
[01:23:02.100 --> 01:23:03.100]   Yeah.
[01:23:03.100 --> 01:23:06.500]   And you know Apple's not using one design language and when you look at what Microsoft
[01:23:06.500 --> 01:23:10.540]   is doing with modern or Metro whatever they're calling it now and Google with material they're
[01:23:10.540 --> 01:23:13.940]   really trying to have a consistent experience across screens and Apple is trying to do
[01:23:13.940 --> 01:23:16.580]   something different on every screen and I like that again I like that we have both
[01:23:16.580 --> 01:23:17.580]   options.
[01:23:17.580 --> 01:23:22.580]   I mean you could pick like an in-between state for an emoji like that's like that's like
[01:23:22.580 --> 01:23:28.860]   that's kind of so many tongues.
[01:23:28.860 --> 01:23:33.500]   Can we can we at least like note that is this what people want to be doing spending minutes
[01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:37.260]   staring at their staring at their wrist to figure out which of these hundred million
[01:23:37.260 --> 01:23:42.460]   emojis to select it is fun and you shouldn't laugh at people who are enjoying the experience
[01:23:42.460 --> 01:23:44.540]   but my mom is going to do it always.
[01:23:44.540 --> 01:23:45.540]   Yeah.
[01:23:45.540 --> 01:23:50.340]   But you really can send nuance you see there's some real nuance in the emojis.
[01:23:50.340 --> 01:23:55.500]   This is the feature for that person at the office that always had that horrible signature
[01:23:55.500 --> 01:23:56.500]   with like.
[01:23:56.500 --> 01:23:57.500]   Yeah.
[01:23:57.500 --> 01:24:00.060]   Put me on your joke mailing list please.
[01:24:00.060 --> 01:24:04.100]   So basically you're saying that the emoji feature is the email what the email forwards
[01:24:04.100 --> 01:24:05.860]   were in 1993.
[01:24:05.860 --> 01:24:06.860]   Yep.
[01:24:06.860 --> 01:24:07.860]   Yep.
[01:24:07.860 --> 01:24:08.860]   Yep.
[01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:10.500]   I think so.
[01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:17.020]   A breaking news coming in Twitter stock trading has been halted as Twitter drops dramatically.
[01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:18.300]   I'm not sure what's going on.
[01:24:18.300 --> 01:24:20.220]   Are they doing the results?
[01:24:20.220 --> 01:24:22.340]   Must be.
[01:24:22.340 --> 01:24:25.700]   But stock trading halted just moments ago on Twitter.
[01:24:25.700 --> 01:24:29.940]   I think possibly the earnings were leaked before.
[01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:31.940]   Yeah.
[01:24:31.940 --> 01:24:35.620]   Twitter plunges after early learning earnings leak report.
[01:24:35.620 --> 01:24:39.140]   The Duke brothers are trying to corner the frozen concentrated orange juice market.
[01:24:39.140 --> 01:24:40.140]   Yeah.
[01:24:40.140 --> 01:24:41.140]   I'm not getting your laptop.
[01:24:41.140 --> 01:24:42.140]   Yeah.
[01:24:42.140 --> 01:24:43.140]   I'm not sure what that is.
[01:24:43.140 --> 01:24:44.140]   But that's all right.
[01:24:44.140 --> 01:24:45.140]   There's nothing to see here.
[01:24:45.140 --> 01:24:46.140]   Move along.
[01:24:46.140 --> 01:24:47.140]   Move along.
[01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:48.140]   So yeah.
[01:24:48.140 --> 01:24:53.860]   Early leak from the Twitter investor relations site or well maybe no leak no hack.
[01:24:53.860 --> 01:24:57.380]   It's just been quickly early prematurely released.
[01:24:57.380 --> 01:25:03.300]   But big drop in quarter quarter one revenue four hundred thirty six million dollars non-gap
[01:25:03.300 --> 01:25:06.460]   PPS seven cents a share.
[01:25:06.460 --> 01:25:07.540]   Okay.
[01:25:07.540 --> 01:25:09.060]   So there you go.
[01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:10.740]   After giving you some breaking news.
[01:25:10.740 --> 01:25:13.140]   I suppose we should have other Mac news Apple news.
[01:25:13.140 --> 01:25:14.140]   Let me see.
[01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:15.140]   We've got the quarterly results.
[01:25:15.140 --> 01:25:16.900]   We've got the watch.
[01:25:16.900 --> 01:25:22.580]   A hundred percent of Apple's US facilities now powered from renewable energy.
[01:25:22.580 --> 01:25:24.140]   Nice.
[01:25:24.140 --> 01:25:26.660]   Although it's not clear whether that's because they're buying credits or they're actually
[01:25:26.660 --> 01:25:27.660]   using renewable energy.
[01:25:27.660 --> 01:25:28.660]   Believe they're buying credit.
[01:25:28.660 --> 01:25:29.660]   I think it almost always.
[01:25:29.660 --> 01:25:32.060]   That's what's the case.
[01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:34.620]   I do refer people to display mate.com.
[01:25:34.620 --> 01:25:36.340]   Did you hear that piercing?
[01:25:36.340 --> 01:25:37.340]   No.
[01:25:37.340 --> 01:25:38.340]   I guess not.
[01:25:38.340 --> 01:25:41.220]   You probably got something from.
[01:25:41.220 --> 01:25:42.220]   Oh no.
[01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:43.580]   It's time for me to go.
[01:25:43.580 --> 01:25:44.580]   Time to.
[01:25:44.580 --> 01:25:45.580]   Stand up.
[01:25:45.580 --> 01:25:46.580]   I have to.
[01:25:46.580 --> 01:25:47.580]   That's the other thing every hour.
[01:25:47.580 --> 01:25:48.580]   It's a little bit.
[01:25:48.580 --> 01:25:49.580]   You can turn that off.
[01:25:49.580 --> 01:25:50.580]   I just got one and I am standing up.
[01:25:50.580 --> 01:25:51.580]   So that's the kind of stuff that I think is.
[01:25:51.580 --> 01:25:53.100]   I think that that's not bad.
[01:25:53.100 --> 01:25:56.660]   I want to be more healthy and anything that can help me do that.
[01:25:56.660 --> 01:25:58.820]   And I discovered the jawbone up and the Nike fuel bed.
[01:25:58.820 --> 01:26:02.060]   All of those did help me encourage me to take that extra step.
[01:26:02.060 --> 01:26:03.260]   You know as you're close and so forth.
[01:26:03.260 --> 01:26:08.300]   I want game center integration so that you and I can compete over standing up.
[01:26:08.300 --> 01:26:11.620]   But hey, it's dead up for 32% more often than you have.
[01:26:11.620 --> 01:26:12.620]   Yeah.
[01:26:12.620 --> 01:26:13.620]   Let's take a break.
[01:26:13.620 --> 01:26:14.620]   We'll do our picks of the week.
[01:26:14.620 --> 01:26:15.620]   You might be surprised by Andy's.
[01:26:15.620 --> 01:26:17.460]   I'm just going to say that.
[01:26:17.460 --> 01:26:19.620]   But first a word from lingualzoom.com.
[01:26:19.620 --> 01:26:24.340]   You know when we started the business 10 years ago now, I talked to you know as you
[01:26:24.340 --> 01:26:27.740]   do when you start a new business you get advice from friends who've been there before.
[01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:32.020]   One of the first people I called is Kevin Rose who's started many a business and even
[01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:33.180]   more since then.
[01:26:33.180 --> 01:26:35.740]   He said corporate incorporate incorporate.
[01:26:35.740 --> 01:26:40.060]   And actually echoes advice Ron Wayne had when Apple was founded.
[01:26:40.060 --> 01:26:41.500]   The reason Ron Wayne bailed out.
[01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:44.180]   He said these guys weren't a corporation.
[01:26:44.180 --> 01:26:45.180]   They were just a company.
[01:26:45.180 --> 01:26:47.340]   That meant anybody could be sued for anything.
[01:26:47.340 --> 01:26:49.660]   He didn't want to take the risk.
[01:26:49.660 --> 01:26:53.180]   So I immediately created an LLC and it was very affordable and very easy.
[01:26:53.180 --> 01:26:54.180]   I didn't go to a law firm.
[01:26:54.180 --> 01:26:56.940]   I went to legalzoom.com.
[01:26:56.940 --> 01:27:03.860]   At a great price, we're still using the documents that generated 10 years ago.
[01:27:03.860 --> 01:27:05.260]   It worked great.
[01:27:05.260 --> 01:27:08.180]   There's five things you can count on when you use legalzoom for your business.
[01:27:08.180 --> 01:27:09.500]   They are reliable.
[01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:13.860]   More than a million people including me have trusted legalzoom to help start their business
[01:27:13.860 --> 01:27:16.140]   to incorporate form an LLC.
[01:27:16.140 --> 01:27:20.460]   A nonprofit too by the way, if you want to do that, get a DBA and more.
[01:27:20.460 --> 01:27:23.380]   Legalzoom can help you get started the right way.
[01:27:23.380 --> 01:27:25.100]   They also have experience doing this.
[01:27:25.100 --> 01:27:28.220]   They've been helping business owners for more than a decade.
[01:27:28.220 --> 01:27:31.700]   You can count on legalzoom for all the details and great support.
[01:27:31.700 --> 01:27:34.740]   The right people are on hand to answer your questions all based in the United States.
[01:27:34.740 --> 01:27:39.140]   By the way, I know legalzoom is not a law firm, but they have built a network of independent
[01:27:39.140 --> 01:27:44.100]   attorneys at a fixed rate available in most states.
[01:27:44.100 --> 01:27:47.100]   There were questions I had like, "What state should we incorporate?"
[01:27:47.100 --> 01:27:54.020]   I even considered making a Twitch educational 501(c)(3) at non-profit.
[01:27:54.020 --> 01:27:58.060]   Being able to ask an attorney what the pros and cons of each are great.
[01:27:58.060 --> 01:27:59.740]   Finally, no surprises.
[01:27:59.740 --> 01:28:04.180]   Legalzoom provides complete transparency with upfront pricing and customer reviews and
[01:28:04.180 --> 01:28:07.060]   a 100% satisfaction guarantee.
[01:28:07.060 --> 01:28:10.300]   If it's time to make a wheel, if it's time to start your business, if it's time to get
[01:28:10.300 --> 01:28:15.300]   a health care power of attorney, all of the stuff that you need to do, you don't really
[01:28:15.300 --> 01:28:17.300]   need to go to a high-priced law firm.
[01:28:17.300 --> 01:28:18.780]   You need legalzoom.
[01:28:18.780 --> 01:28:19.780]   Make the smart choice.

[01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:25.420]   You'll save.

[01:28:29.380 --> 01:28:32.260]   Not only will you save, that's how they know.
[01:28:32.260 --> 01:28:34.140]   You heard it here.
[01:28:34.140 --> 01:28:35.140]   Legalzoom.com.
[01:28:35.140 --> 01:28:38.940]   Andrew Inatko, your pick of the week, my friend.
[01:28:38.940 --> 01:28:42.540]   Well, I knew that you stinkers would all have Apple watches and I would not.
[01:28:42.540 --> 01:28:44.620]   I wanted to talk about wearables a little bit.
[01:28:44.620 --> 01:28:50.140]   I have finally got a chance to try out Microsoft Band.
[01:28:50.140 --> 01:28:52.340]   It's a very, very interesting product for a lot of good reasons.
[01:28:52.340 --> 01:28:57.300]   I've been wearing it daily since the weekend.
[01:28:57.300 --> 01:29:03.140]   There's something that didn't really occur to me about the strength of this design until
[01:29:03.140 --> 01:29:06.220]   I started wearing it and until I started seeing other people wearing it.
[01:29:06.220 --> 01:29:09.580]   The thing is that this presents itself as a fitness band.
[01:29:09.580 --> 01:29:13.780]   And really, I think that in terms of its design, it really is designed to be a fitness
[01:29:13.780 --> 01:29:17.060]   band with extra features on it as opposed to a smart watch.
[01:29:17.060 --> 01:29:20.780]   And the value of that is that you can walk around and people are used to seeing like a
[01:29:20.780 --> 01:29:23.420]   black rubberish band on your wrist.
[01:29:23.420 --> 01:29:26.340]   That leaves this wrist free that you can actually wear whatever you want.
[01:29:26.340 --> 01:29:28.060]   So you can still wear your grandfather's watch.
[01:29:28.060 --> 01:29:31.580]   You can still wear the stylish watch that you absolutely love.
[01:29:31.580 --> 01:29:34.780]   You can still wear whatever else you have on this wrist.
[01:29:34.780 --> 01:29:40.300]   But you still get what are some of the marquee features of a smart watch that is fitness
[01:29:40.300 --> 01:29:43.340]   tracking and notifications from your phone.
[01:29:43.340 --> 01:29:44.740]   Works with iOS, works with Android.
[01:29:44.740 --> 01:29:47.660]   It has a couple extra features if you're wearing it with a Windows phone device.
[01:29:47.660 --> 01:29:50.020]   But for our purposes, it works fine with iOS.
[01:29:50.020 --> 01:29:54.620]   It will communicate iOS notifications just fine.
[01:29:54.620 --> 01:29:59.660]   It also communicates with a fitness and health app that Microsoft has for iOS that will track
[01:29:59.660 --> 01:30:07.860]   a really nice array of information, not only heart rate, but also oxygen saturation levels,
[01:30:07.860 --> 01:30:08.860]   temperature.
[01:30:08.860 --> 01:30:10.940]   It also do UV index.
[01:30:10.940 --> 01:30:13.940]   And it also has GPS built right into it.
[01:30:13.940 --> 01:30:21.700]   And to what Renee said about using calibrating the pedometer on your Apple watch, this is
[01:30:21.700 --> 01:30:22.700]   the exact same thing.
[01:30:22.700 --> 01:30:24.260]   It has GPS built in.
[01:30:24.260 --> 01:30:26.580]   Obviously using GPS will drain the battery.
[01:30:26.580 --> 01:30:32.020]   So what they do say is that when you do your first walks or runs, if you leave the GPS
[01:30:32.020 --> 01:30:35.500]   on for the first couple of days that you do that, it will learn what the length of your
[01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:38.900]   stride is and that it will then you can turn the GPS off.
[01:30:38.900 --> 01:30:45.020]   It will not track your location, but it will calibrate your stride and give you more accurate
[01:30:45.020 --> 01:30:46.020]   distances.
[01:30:46.020 --> 01:30:49.540]   But if you do keep the GPS turned on while you bike or while you walk or run, it will
[01:30:49.540 --> 01:30:56.180]   of course record a breadcrumb trail of exactly your exact route that you can then download
[01:30:56.180 --> 01:31:01.060]   to your computer and then overlay on a map and figure out stuff like that.
[01:31:01.060 --> 01:31:07.500]   I like it in that it works in a way that the Fitbit that I tried for about a month didn't,
[01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:11.380]   because all the Fitbit did was say you've got 1.2.3.4.5 dots.
[01:31:11.380 --> 01:31:16.260]   This will give you that same wealth of information that you get from a Moto 360 or to a lesser
[01:31:16.260 --> 01:31:21.580]   extent, less information that you get from an Apple watch, but still valuable actual numbers
[01:31:21.580 --> 01:31:24.780]   to show you how well you're pressing toward your progress.
[01:31:24.780 --> 01:31:28.340]   It will also after it's been able to look at your level of fitness and activity for the
[01:31:28.340 --> 01:31:32.340]   next for a couple of weeks, then it can actually say, okay, I'm going to tailor a workout for
[01:31:32.340 --> 01:31:37.660]   you so you can actually follow the instructions that's giving you on this band to get to a
[01:31:37.660 --> 01:31:43.780]   positive workout that keeps your heart level up and gives you actual valuable ongoing results.
[01:31:43.780 --> 01:31:51.340]   And it is less of a commitment than having a real forereel.
[01:31:51.340 --> 01:31:54.820]   This is the one watch that I'm allowed to wear because if I wear a watch on both wrists,
[01:31:54.820 --> 01:31:58.260]   I look even more like a dork than I do with a fitness band on one wrist and a wrist watch
[01:31:58.260 --> 01:31:59.580]   on the other one.
[01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:04.580]   A couple of disadvantages among them that this doesn't automatically light up when you turn
[01:32:04.580 --> 01:32:08.620]   it so you actually have to push a clicky button to get it to light up.
[01:32:08.620 --> 01:32:13.460]   Also the user interface is horizontal, so it's not like you can do like this and then
[01:32:13.460 --> 01:32:15.060]   you have to go like this to read it.
[01:32:15.060 --> 01:32:20.540]   So you have to sort of learn how to read it in a vertical orientation.
[01:32:20.540 --> 01:32:27.180]   And also it gets a full two days of battery life on a single charge, but they make that
[01:32:27.180 --> 01:32:31.380]   magic happen by putting part of the battery inside the band.
[01:32:31.380 --> 01:32:35.980]   So obviously it's chunkier than a fitness band.
[01:32:35.980 --> 01:32:44.500]   And so it's also not quite as comfortable to wear as a watch or as a fitness band.
[01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:49.260]   It's not uncomfortable, but there's definitely a presence on your wrist that you don't feel
[01:32:49.260 --> 01:32:50.340]   otherwise.
[01:32:50.340 --> 01:32:55.100]   But as a device that you wear 24 hours a day, it'll also do things like sleep tracking.
[01:32:55.100 --> 01:32:56.660]   It was very, very cool.
[01:32:56.660 --> 01:33:01.300]   I've had apps before that check your sleep, but not the kind that will say, oh, by the
[01:33:01.300 --> 01:33:02.700]   way, you actually, good morning.
[01:33:02.700 --> 01:33:03.700]   Are you up now?
[01:33:03.700 --> 01:33:04.700]   Good.
[01:33:04.700 --> 01:33:05.700]   Okay.
[01:33:05.700 --> 01:33:06.860]   You slept for an actual 5.2 hours.
[01:33:06.860 --> 01:33:11.060]   And now just like any other number for fitness as well, you know what?
[01:33:11.060 --> 01:33:15.420]   If I work hard, I bet I can break that record and sleep for seven hours tomorrow night.
[01:33:15.420 --> 01:33:16.420]   You know what?
[01:33:16.420 --> 01:33:18.980]   I'm going to do what it takes to make sure that I break my record of 10 hours.
[01:33:18.980 --> 01:33:21.860]   So sorry, I'm just moving because my watch told me to keep going in.
[01:33:21.860 --> 01:33:22.860]   There you go.
[01:33:22.860 --> 01:33:24.780]   Do that's in your Apple watch.
[01:33:24.780 --> 01:33:27.740]   Get inside your head, man.
[01:33:27.740 --> 01:33:31.340]   That's exactly what Apple was the Microsoft watch to that.
[01:33:31.340 --> 01:33:37.540]   Yeah, but but it's it's as I said, it's it's a I like the fact that there are for now four
[01:33:37.540 --> 01:33:40.460]   major platforms, each with four different perspectives.
[01:33:40.460 --> 01:33:43.860]   This one being that look, if you wear a watch on this wrist, you've got another free watch
[01:33:43.860 --> 01:33:47.140]   that free wrist they can use for fitness and notifications.
[01:33:47.140 --> 01:33:48.900]   This is a good way to do that.
[01:33:48.900 --> 01:33:51.700]   It's platform agnostic and it costs 200 bucks.
[01:33:51.700 --> 01:33:53.380]   This is also very much a 1.0.
[01:33:53.380 --> 01:33:59.900]   I don't think Microsoft built enough of them to anticipate a high demand because that's
[01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:01.820]   how they managed to sell out of them so quickly.
[01:34:01.820 --> 01:34:05.460]   So they're they were hard to find after their initial launch in October or November.
[01:34:05.460 --> 01:34:08.380]   I think new band just come in from time to time though, right?
[01:34:08.380 --> 01:34:09.380]   Exactly.
[01:34:09.380 --> 01:34:10.900]   It's not it's that's not because everybody wants one.
[01:34:10.900 --> 01:34:13.260]   It's because they have not been building very many of these.
[01:34:13.260 --> 01:34:17.820]   But again, if you've always if if your resistance to wearing a smart watch is that but I like
[01:34:17.820 --> 01:34:21.220]   the watch that I have right now and I don't want to commit to all this new software and
[01:34:21.220 --> 01:34:26.580]   all this sort of stuff, this will give you at least 50 to 60% of what is really cool about
[01:34:26.580 --> 01:34:30.300]   having a smart watch without having to again give up your really classy watch that you
[01:34:30.300 --> 01:34:31.300]   really really like.
[01:34:31.300 --> 01:34:32.580]   I mean, I love this watch.
[01:34:32.580 --> 01:34:37.220]   It took me like two or three months to find I'm looking for my first nice, you know, as
[01:34:37.220 --> 01:34:43.940]   in didn't buy it in a in a plastic case for $50 watch and I miss it when I don't get
[01:34:43.940 --> 01:34:44.940]   to what we're all the time.
[01:34:44.940 --> 01:34:48.460]   So I do actually a couple a day a day a week or maybe even two days a week.
[01:34:48.460 --> 01:34:52.420]   I'll put this on simply because I enjoy as much as I like my smart watch, but this allows
[01:34:52.420 --> 01:34:54.580]   me to have sort of the both best of both worlds.
[01:34:54.580 --> 01:34:56.380]   So I'm not saying that this is the perfect device.
[01:34:56.380 --> 01:35:00.740]   It is a 1.0, but it is something worth looking at if you suspect that you can benefit from
[01:35:00.740 --> 01:35:04.700]   having a health tracker and you want it to do a little bit more than just simply annoy
[01:35:04.700 --> 01:35:09.740]   you and buzz in your wrist when it thinks you're being too much of a sit down person.
[01:35:09.740 --> 01:35:10.740]   Great pick.
[01:35:10.740 --> 01:35:13.100]   Paul Therat loves his too.
[01:35:13.100 --> 01:35:17.140]   Yeah, it's actually kind of almost a surprise that actually Microsoft did something that's
[01:35:17.140 --> 01:35:20.060]   really unique in space.
[01:35:20.060 --> 01:35:24.020]   I don't know this one of those times you think I went I don't know who they hired or fired
[01:35:24.020 --> 01:35:28.780]   four or five years ago, but they start to figure out things that were that allow them
[01:35:28.780 --> 01:35:31.220]   to do some cool stuff from time.
[01:35:31.220 --> 01:35:32.780]   Yeah.
[01:35:32.780 --> 01:35:36.020]   Mr. Adam Christensen of the Maccast, Maccast.com.
[01:35:36.020 --> 01:35:38.100]   What do you got for us?
[01:35:38.100 --> 01:35:44.940]   I'm going to pick an oldie, but a goodie, but I think it's become somewhat irrelevant
[01:35:44.940 --> 01:35:47.900]   in this day and age with our thinner and thinner notebooks.
[01:35:47.900 --> 01:35:52.580]   So something I've used for years as a product from a couple products from RadTech.
[01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:56.420]   They're the sleeves and this is the purple one, but you can get it in a bunch of different
[01:35:56.420 --> 01:35:59.380]   colors, red, blue, gray, black.
[01:35:59.380 --> 01:36:02.820]   And say microfiber screen protector.
[01:36:02.820 --> 01:36:05.140]   This one's the what they call the screen saver.
[01:36:05.140 --> 01:36:08.220]   Don't I get one of these every time I buy a new MacBook?
[01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:12.140]   Well, if you buy the same MacBook, like here's one thing I wanted to comment on them.
[01:36:12.140 --> 01:36:16.380]   So I kept buying the 15 inch form factor and it didn't really change too much in thickness.
[01:36:16.380 --> 01:36:21.980]   So I had the same set for probably eight years before.
[01:36:21.980 --> 01:36:24.580]   I think it started to finally break down.
[01:36:24.580 --> 01:36:27.740]   So they lasted very long, but yeah, you might need to get them each time.
[01:36:27.740 --> 01:36:30.900]   But what it does is you type on your keyboard, right?
[01:36:30.900 --> 01:36:36.140]   You're going to leave dirt and oils behind with now that laptops are so thin, you put
[01:36:36.140 --> 01:36:37.580]   any force on the outside of that.
[01:36:37.580 --> 01:36:43.260]   It's going to gently press down on the screen, maybe go into the keys and then you get that
[01:36:43.260 --> 01:36:46.100]   sort of key pattern, oily key pattern on your screen.
[01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:48.780]   So the screen saver protects from that.
[01:36:48.780 --> 01:36:54.380]   And then they also have what's called the sleeve, which goes over the outside.
[01:36:54.380 --> 01:36:57.300]   And I like that one because it protects the outer case of my MacBook.
[01:36:57.300 --> 01:36:59.340]   It's a nice form-fitting sleeve.
[01:36:59.340 --> 01:37:00.460]   And then I can slide it in there.
[01:37:00.460 --> 01:37:02.820]   I don't have to worry about it when I'm sliding it into my bag.
[01:37:02.820 --> 01:37:10.300]   I actually put my iPad right next to my laptop in that main compartment because I've got
[01:37:10.300 --> 01:37:11.300]   the cover on it.
[01:37:11.300 --> 01:37:13.340]   I know they're not going to scratch each other up.
[01:37:13.340 --> 01:37:14.420]   And they're really durable.
[01:37:14.420 --> 01:37:16.380]   They're really well made.
[01:37:16.380 --> 01:37:20.100]   You might see the price and go, oh, that's expensive, but I guarantee you once you have
[01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:21.380]   these things, you're going to love them.
[01:37:21.380 --> 01:37:24.980]   And what's great about the little one on the keyboard too is you can use it as a nice microfiber
[01:37:24.980 --> 01:37:27.580]   cloth to clean the screen and stuff like that.
[01:37:27.580 --> 01:37:28.580]   So they're always there.
[01:37:28.580 --> 01:37:29.580]   They're always handy.
[01:37:29.580 --> 01:37:31.140]   You always have them with you.
[01:37:31.140 --> 01:37:32.140]   I love this product.
[01:37:32.140 --> 01:37:33.420]   And like I said, I've used it for years.
[01:37:33.420 --> 01:37:37.860]   And I think now that laptops are getting thinner and thinner, they're becoming even more important.
[01:37:37.860 --> 01:37:40.540]   I'm thinking the MacBook, this will be a must-have.
[01:37:40.540 --> 01:37:41.540]   Yeah.
[01:37:41.540 --> 01:37:42.540]   So love them.
[01:37:42.540 --> 01:37:43.540]   And it's a great product.
[01:37:43.540 --> 01:37:45.940]   And they've been around in the Mac community for years, RadTech.
[01:37:45.940 --> 01:37:46.940]   About 15 bucks.
[01:37:46.940 --> 01:37:47.940]   Great stuff.
[01:37:47.940 --> 01:37:48.940]   Yeah.
[01:37:48.940 --> 01:37:49.940]   For the screen saver.
[01:37:49.940 --> 01:37:51.220]   Thank you, Adam.
[01:37:51.220 --> 01:37:54.020]   You've been around for how long has Mac cast been around for?
[01:37:54.020 --> 01:37:55.020]   10 years.
[01:37:55.020 --> 01:37:56.020]   Yeah.
[01:37:56.020 --> 01:37:57.020]   In the 11th year.
[01:37:57.020 --> 01:37:58.020]   One of the original shows.
[01:37:58.020 --> 01:37:59.700]   You started in 2004 then.
[01:37:59.700 --> 01:38:00.700]   Yeah.
[01:38:00.700 --> 01:38:03.700]   December 13th, 2004 was the first episode.
[01:38:03.700 --> 01:38:04.700]   Wow.
[01:38:04.700 --> 01:38:08.340]   So one of the oldest Macintosh podcasts and still one of the best.
[01:38:08.340 --> 01:38:09.340]   I think so.
[01:38:09.340 --> 01:38:10.340]   Yeah.
[01:38:10.340 --> 01:38:11.980]   Backcast.com.
[01:38:11.980 --> 01:38:13.820]   We love it.
[01:38:13.820 --> 01:38:16.220]   Mr. Renee Ritchie, do you have a pick for us?
[01:38:16.220 --> 01:38:17.220]   I do.
[01:38:17.220 --> 01:38:19.620]   I have a couple actually and they're very similar.
[01:38:19.620 --> 01:38:23.060]   One of the things I like most about the Apple Watch is remote control.
[01:38:23.060 --> 01:38:26.380]   I already have the Hue apps so I can turn on and off these lights behind me and we've
[01:38:26.380 --> 01:38:27.380]   been doing that for a while.
[01:38:27.380 --> 01:38:31.940]   But there's some really great iOS apps like DJ for iPhone, which I've picked before.
[01:38:31.940 --> 01:38:35.660]   But right now it's free because they just launched their watch extension.
[01:38:35.660 --> 01:38:39.900]   So you can load up your iPhone with all the music you want to DJ and then sit there.
[01:38:39.900 --> 01:38:44.420]   And they have one of the best interactivity models I've seen on the Apple Watch so far
[01:38:44.420 --> 01:38:48.340]   where you can press a button and it'll start to intelligently know when to switch between
[01:38:48.340 --> 01:38:53.660]   songs and when to do cuts and all these different things and it works really well.
[01:38:53.660 --> 01:38:56.100]   So if you're even if you're not like, I don't know much about music.
[01:38:56.100 --> 01:38:57.100]   I'm not a DJ.
[01:38:57.100 --> 01:39:00.500]   I'm sure DJ is really loved this, but just if I have friends over and I'm sitting there
[01:39:00.500 --> 01:39:03.740]   cooking and I want to quickly change something, I can press a button on my watch.
[01:39:03.740 --> 01:39:05.340]   I don't have to go and pull my phone out.
[01:39:05.340 --> 01:39:10.060]   Again, it's all that convenience factor and a pacemaker is the same.
[01:39:10.060 --> 01:39:16.140]   It lets you keep a bunch of music on your Apple Watch on your iPhone and then with really
[01:39:16.140 --> 01:39:20.540]   bright, intelligent, interactive controls on your Apple Watch, it lets you just do this
[01:39:20.540 --> 01:39:23.980]   sort of it makes you look good in front of your friends Leo, like you have better music
[01:39:23.980 --> 01:39:27.660]   sense and savvy and DJ abilities than you actually have.
[01:39:27.660 --> 01:39:31.820]   And every app that makes us look good, we kind of feel a little bit happy about.
[01:39:31.820 --> 01:39:36.220]   So again, these to me show that, you know, with really, really smart developers, you
[01:39:36.220 --> 01:39:38.580]   can do a lot of really cool things with the Apple Watch.
[01:39:38.580 --> 01:39:41.980]   Do you think you'll ever really use DJ on your watch?
[01:39:41.980 --> 01:39:45.460]   I use it because it like it just impr- like if you if you have a music app, it looks all
[01:39:45.460 --> 01:39:49.140]   right, but if you have double turn tables on your iPhone or iPad and you're sitting there
[01:39:49.140 --> 01:39:52.220]   just nodding your head like you know what you're doing and pressing a button and it
[01:39:52.220 --> 01:39:55.380]   makes an awesome switch, that's three points for you Leo.
[01:39:55.380 --> 01:39:57.020]   I mean, it makes you look good.
[01:39:57.020 --> 01:40:00.220]   You got to wear your headphones half on half, your Beats headphones half on half.
[01:40:00.220 --> 01:40:04.420]   You just put them on and you just move your head like this and your other wrist is free.
[01:40:04.420 --> 01:40:08.100]   You tap it and everyone thinks you're a master mixer.
[01:40:08.100 --> 01:40:11.620]   He's controlling our audio experience from the kitchen while making croissants, the
[01:40:11.620 --> 01:40:12.620]   man's a miracle worker.
[01:40:12.620 --> 01:40:14.660]   DJ is amazing on the iPad.
[01:40:14.660 --> 01:40:17.820]   You probably already have it so might as well just put it on your watch.
[01:40:17.820 --> 01:40:19.420]   And if you don't, it's free right now.
[01:40:19.420 --> 01:40:20.420]   It's free.
[01:40:20.420 --> 01:40:22.580]   All of this stuff is because they haven't figured out a charge.
[01:40:22.580 --> 01:40:24.980]   Well, but the iPhone app, which is usually several bucks.
[01:40:24.980 --> 01:40:25.980]   Oh, is it free too?
[01:40:25.980 --> 01:40:26.980]   Oh, nice.
[01:40:26.980 --> 01:40:31.020]   So if you haven't got it yet, you're looking for a really, yeah, and it's a cool way just
[01:40:31.020 --> 01:40:32.500]   to display music on your iPhone.
[01:40:32.500 --> 01:40:33.660]   You'll forget everything else.
[01:40:33.660 --> 01:40:34.660]   Yeah.
[01:40:34.660 --> 01:40:39.100]   Because they take the actual, the for skeuomorphic fans, they take the actual voice print and
[01:40:39.100 --> 01:40:42.860]   put it over the album so that you can see the grooves like you would a conditional record.
[01:40:42.860 --> 01:40:45.260]   Come on, knock that off.
[01:40:45.260 --> 01:40:46.260]   Yeah.
[01:40:46.260 --> 01:40:47.260]   Cool.
[01:40:47.260 --> 01:40:49.860]   Yeah, the algorithm guys have serious game.
[01:40:49.860 --> 01:40:51.340]   I want to download that right now.
[01:40:51.340 --> 01:40:54.540]   I've been laughing at it because it seems like such a silly thing to have a watch interface
[01:40:54.540 --> 01:40:58.900]   to a DJ turntable part of their new part of the new update they did.
[01:40:58.900 --> 01:40:59.900]   I forget the name.
[01:40:59.900 --> 01:41:00.900]   I think it's Philip a pioneer.
[01:41:00.900 --> 01:41:04.620]   Whatever the big turntable system, almost every DJ's use, they actually opened up and
[01:41:04.620 --> 01:41:05.860]   let them integrate with it.
[01:41:05.860 --> 01:41:10.500]   So for professional DJs, they can now use their iPhone, their iPad to control like hardcore
[01:41:10.500 --> 01:41:11.500]   equipment.
[01:41:11.500 --> 01:41:12.820]   You have the glance on your Apple watch.
[01:41:12.820 --> 01:41:16.700]   If you do need to reach for that beverage or talk to that person at the booth and you
[01:41:16.700 --> 01:41:20.260]   want to just tap a button quickly and cover yourself, you're all set.
[01:41:20.260 --> 01:41:22.260]   I want to thank one of our viewers yesterday.
[01:41:22.260 --> 01:41:27.180]   We were doing iPad today and one of our viewers has said, "How come you guys never pick Skyforce
[01:41:27.180 --> 01:41:29.620]   2014 as your app cap?"
[01:41:29.620 --> 01:41:36.540]   So I immediately downloaded iPad or iPhone and wow, this is a great fun top down scroller.
[01:41:36.540 --> 01:41:42.820]   If you ever played Xaxon, you'll recognize the style of this but the graphics are great.
[01:41:42.820 --> 01:41:44.700]   This is for some of the iPhone.
[01:41:44.700 --> 01:41:46.300]   I played on the iPad.
[01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:50.660]   Great music, great fun, very exciting game.
[01:41:50.660 --> 01:41:55.700]   In-app purchases, Buck 99 to remove ads, although I haven't seen many ads.
[01:41:55.700 --> 01:41:59.460]   It really is a lot of fun and weather graphics are great.
[01:41:59.460 --> 01:42:05.980]   This is Skyforce 2014 from Infinite Dreams, the 10th anniversary edition.
[01:42:05.980 --> 01:42:12.940]   You may remember, I guess it must have been arcade versions of this game, right?
[01:42:12.940 --> 01:42:14.420]   I know, I know, I know, I know, I watch.
[01:42:14.420 --> 01:42:18.060]   We're going to fly through the environment.
[01:42:18.060 --> 01:42:20.660]   I don't know if you saw it, but Mario is somewhere on an island.
[01:42:20.660 --> 01:42:28.300]   We've got to rescue him and of course shoot incoming airplanes as we're going, gather stuff,
[01:42:28.300 --> 01:42:29.300]   power up.
[01:42:29.300 --> 01:42:31.620]   None of those crew members had families.
[01:42:31.620 --> 01:42:33.380]   Yeah, right, exactly.
[01:42:33.380 --> 01:42:35.180]   What do you mean?
[01:42:35.180 --> 01:42:36.180]   Come on.
[01:42:36.180 --> 01:42:42.940]   I'm just saying, the projection of power for foreign policy is sometimes comes at too
[01:42:42.940 --> 01:42:44.940]   great a cost, Leo.
[01:42:44.940 --> 01:42:47.180]   Of what cost to our national character is this?
[01:42:47.180 --> 01:42:50.060]   Oh, no bits were harmed in the making of this game.
[01:42:50.060 --> 01:42:51.820]   Come on.
[01:42:51.820 --> 01:42:52.820]   It's fun.
[01:42:52.820 --> 01:42:54.300]   I understand they're all Hitler clones.
[01:42:54.300 --> 01:42:57.060]   They're all Hitler clones, exactly.
[01:42:57.060 --> 01:42:58.060]   They're all the time clones.
[01:42:58.060 --> 01:42:59.060]   There's the boss.
[01:42:59.060 --> 01:43:00.060]   Hitler clones either.
[01:43:00.060 --> 01:43:01.540]   Watch out for the boss.
[01:43:01.540 --> 01:43:03.100]   He's tough, tough, tough.
[01:43:03.100 --> 01:43:06.740]   Anyway, this is a fun game.
[01:43:06.740 --> 01:43:11.380]   I always look for games that are native to the touch interface.
[01:43:11.380 --> 01:43:14.700]   This is actually a really good one for that because all you have to do is hold your finger
[01:43:14.700 --> 01:43:16.580]   on the screen and go around.
[01:43:16.580 --> 01:43:19.140]   I showed you a kind of a...
[01:43:19.140 --> 01:43:22.580]   Whoa, there's a laser.
[01:43:22.580 --> 01:43:25.860]   Oh no.
[01:43:25.860 --> 01:43:26.860]   Skyforce 2014.
[01:43:26.860 --> 01:43:32.900]   Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes this edition of Backbreak Weekly, the first in the Apple
[01:43:32.900 --> 01:43:35.580]   Watch era.
[01:43:35.580 --> 01:43:37.380]   I mentioned this in our Before You Buy review.
[01:43:37.380 --> 01:43:42.500]   I remember the day before the eve of the iPad coming out, the eve of the iPhone coming
[01:43:42.500 --> 01:43:46.100]   out thinking after tomorrow everything's different.
[01:43:46.100 --> 01:43:49.980]   I don't know if you could say the same for the Apple Watch, but...
[01:43:49.980 --> 01:43:52.500]   We were so naive last week.
[01:43:52.500 --> 01:43:58.020]   Now, so young, so innocent.
[01:43:58.020 --> 01:44:04.140]   Again, great thanks to Adam Christensen for pioneering the Mac podcast and continuing
[01:44:04.140 --> 01:44:07.460]   Maccast for 10 years.
[01:44:07.460 --> 01:44:08.460]   You were at Nick.
[01:44:08.460 --> 01:44:10.580]   What do you do these days?
[01:44:10.580 --> 01:44:11.580]   I am self-employed.
[01:44:11.580 --> 01:44:12.580]   I am a podcaster.
[01:44:12.580 --> 01:44:14.780]   I do a little bit of web development.
[01:44:14.780 --> 01:44:16.260]   That's crazy talk.
[01:44:16.260 --> 01:44:17.260]   Yeah.
[01:44:17.260 --> 01:44:18.260]   Work for myself.
[01:44:18.260 --> 01:44:19.660]   I'm solo.
[01:44:19.660 --> 01:44:22.500]   Big network or anything like that, but we could buy.
[01:44:22.500 --> 01:44:25.540]   I have to say, did you work on Snap Seat?
[01:44:25.540 --> 01:44:27.100]   Was that one of your things when you were in Nick?
[01:44:27.100 --> 01:44:31.020]   Well, I was their web developer, so I did all their e-comm and stuff like that.
[01:44:31.020 --> 01:44:34.540]   One thing I'm proud of, though, is I went and looked at their shopping cart that they're
[01:44:34.540 --> 01:44:36.500]   using to sell the next ever Google.
[01:44:36.500 --> 01:44:38.540]   I think it still has the same look.
[01:44:38.540 --> 01:44:40.020]   I don't know if the code is the same.
[01:44:40.020 --> 01:44:41.020]   Oh, that would be awesome.
[01:44:41.020 --> 01:44:43.460]   Your code is running on the Google servers now.
[01:44:43.460 --> 01:44:45.500]   I was proud that they didn't change it, so...
[01:44:45.500 --> 01:44:52.340]   Now, Snap Seat, they did just recently update, and it is absolutely the go-to now photo editing
[01:44:52.340 --> 01:44:53.340]   app.
[01:44:53.340 --> 01:44:56.340]   I thought Avery was going to give them a little trouble, but boy, I love the new Snap Seat.
[01:44:56.340 --> 01:44:59.860]   Yeah, I'm not sure how I feel about the new UI, but it's still a bit different.
[01:44:59.860 --> 01:45:01.860]   But boy, is it powerful?
[01:45:01.860 --> 01:45:03.780]   I love it.
[01:45:03.780 --> 01:45:04.780]   Thank you, Adam.
[01:45:04.780 --> 01:45:08.340]   Everybody should go to matcast.com, subscribe today.
[01:45:08.340 --> 01:45:10.220]   Renee Ritchie at imore.com.
[01:45:10.220 --> 01:45:14.620]   If you want to know about the watch, he's got the guys and gals on it.
[01:45:14.620 --> 01:45:19.460]   The most articles per pound of any Apple blog, imore.com.
[01:45:19.460 --> 01:45:20.460]   And of course...
[01:45:20.460 --> 01:45:22.620]   We don't drink you under the table, Leo.
[01:45:22.620 --> 01:45:23.620]   We just write articles.
[01:45:23.620 --> 01:45:25.660]   You're writing us under the table.
[01:45:25.660 --> 01:45:28.020]   And podcasting too, a lot of great podcasts.
[01:45:28.020 --> 01:45:29.500]   If you go to imore, you'll find them in the podcast.
[01:45:29.500 --> 01:45:33.820]   D-bug is back this week with Horace D'Gia as the guest, because he used to be a developer.
[01:45:33.820 --> 01:45:34.820]   I love Horace.
[01:45:34.820 --> 01:45:37.140]   How is he awesome?
[01:45:37.140 --> 01:45:38.140]   Very smart guy.
[01:45:38.140 --> 01:45:39.140]   Good.
[01:45:39.140 --> 01:45:40.980]   We'll make sure to listen.
[01:45:40.980 --> 01:45:45.740]   But if you're not going to go, he's not wearing an Apple watch, but someday.
[01:45:45.740 --> 01:45:48.940]   I'm not calling down to the man.
[01:45:48.940 --> 01:45:53.500]   Of course, you can catch all his work at the Chicago Sun Times.
[01:45:53.500 --> 01:45:56.260]   Did you order one, or are you just kind of waiting, or what is the deal?
[01:45:56.260 --> 01:46:00.140]   No, because I'm confident that when my term comes, the term comes.
[01:46:00.140 --> 01:46:03.420]   They'll send me a review unit.
[01:46:03.420 --> 01:46:06.700]   And the fact that I was away at a conference and thinking that, "Okay, so I'm going to
[01:46:06.700 --> 01:46:11.460]   have to not go to this party and stand by to get in there, not in the first five minutes,
[01:46:11.460 --> 01:46:17.140]   but in the first 30 seconds to spend $350 that I could be spending on airfare to another
[01:46:17.140 --> 01:46:18.140]   conference."
[01:46:18.140 --> 01:46:25.860]   And at the end of the day, I'm going through a philosophical thing these days where it's
[01:46:25.860 --> 01:46:30.700]   like, "How valuable is it for me to have to have a review out in the first three days
[01:46:30.700 --> 01:46:34.660]   versus I value the 30 days that I will be able to spend with it and whatever I will
[01:46:34.660 --> 01:46:37.260]   be able to write after those 30 days?"
[01:46:37.260 --> 01:46:41.100]   Which is not to say that I'm not an incredibly jealous agree with the people who had them
[01:46:41.100 --> 01:46:42.100]   early.
[01:46:42.100 --> 01:46:43.100]   It's fine.
[01:46:43.100 --> 01:46:47.460]   Yeah, I just feel like, "Come on, this is the Chicago Sun Times here.
[01:46:47.460 --> 01:46:49.340]   This is one of the hosts of Mac Break Weekly.
[01:46:49.340 --> 01:46:52.980]   This is not, I just don't understand Apple's review policy.
[01:46:52.980 --> 01:46:53.980]   I really don't.
[01:46:53.980 --> 01:46:54.980]   It's not entitlement.
[01:46:54.980 --> 01:46:59.100]   I'm pretty sure of this just because there's an audience that I have that they're already
[01:46:59.100 --> 01:47:00.100]   reaching elsewhere.
[01:47:00.100 --> 01:47:01.100]   Apparently.
[01:47:01.100 --> 01:47:02.100]   It's not entitlement.
[01:47:02.100 --> 01:47:03.100]   I'll get it whenever it's my turn to get it.
[01:47:03.100 --> 01:47:04.100]   That's fine.
[01:47:04.100 --> 01:47:05.100]   It makes me mad.
[01:47:05.100 --> 01:47:06.100]   It shouldn't.
[01:47:06.100 --> 01:47:08.420]   It doesn't make me mad why I should make you mad.
[01:47:08.420 --> 01:47:09.420]   Because I'm in the same boat.
[01:47:09.420 --> 01:47:10.420]   That's why.
[01:47:10.420 --> 01:47:12.060]   Actually, I'll never get a review unit.
[01:47:12.060 --> 01:47:13.860]   That's the boat I'm in.
[01:47:13.860 --> 01:47:16.220]   I'm in the boat behind your boat.
[01:47:16.220 --> 01:47:18.660]   You got hand-tied boat time, money man.
[01:47:18.660 --> 01:47:23.460]   I'm on a balsa wood raft 400 feet behind you.
[01:47:23.460 --> 01:47:25.420]   Both eyes are cool.
[01:47:25.420 --> 01:47:28.180]   I tie myself with my own two little hands.
[01:47:28.180 --> 01:47:30.220]   He owes a time lord.
[01:47:30.220 --> 01:47:31.220]   Very nice.
[01:47:31.220 --> 01:47:34.140]   I decided I want to look more like Doctor Who.
[01:47:34.140 --> 01:47:36.420]   Who doesn't after all?
[01:47:36.420 --> 01:47:37.420]   Thank you gentlemen.
[01:47:37.420 --> 01:47:38.420]   Sentimental people.
[01:47:38.420 --> 01:47:39.420]   One.
[01:47:39.420 --> 01:47:41.740]   Non-censible people do not want to look like Doctor Who.
[01:47:41.740 --> 01:47:45.260]   I am now grappling with which wrist I should wear this thing on.
[01:47:45.260 --> 01:47:47.060]   Thanks Renee.
[01:47:47.060 --> 01:47:48.060]   And by the way--
[01:47:48.060 --> 01:47:49.060]   That was me.
[01:47:49.060 --> 01:47:50.060]   That was me.
[01:47:50.060 --> 01:47:51.060]   Oh, thanks Adam.
[01:47:51.060 --> 01:47:52.060]   Don't heap that on Renee.
[01:47:52.060 --> 01:47:58.980]   And by the way, Renee, if I turn off the-- now I don't know how to even get out of this.
[01:47:58.980 --> 01:47:59.980]   Where am I doing?
[01:47:59.980 --> 01:48:00.980]   Where am I?
[01:48:00.980 --> 01:48:01.980]   I don't know what me will be wanting.
[01:48:01.980 --> 01:48:02.980]   Are you stuck in the game?
[01:48:02.980 --> 01:48:03.980]   No.
[01:48:03.980 --> 01:48:09.300]   If I turn off activate on wrist-- what do I want to turn off wrist detection?
[01:48:09.300 --> 01:48:12.260]   It sounds like that's a negative.
[01:48:12.260 --> 01:48:15.660]   It says when this is on Apple Watch, we'll automatically show you the time and latest
[01:48:15.660 --> 01:48:17.500]   alerts when you raise your wrist.
[01:48:17.500 --> 01:48:18.500]   I want to turn that off.
[01:48:18.500 --> 01:48:22.340]   But if you're using a passcode wrist detection, locks your watch when you're not wearing it.
[01:48:22.340 --> 01:48:23.820]   So your information stays secure.
[01:48:23.820 --> 01:48:26.660]   If I turn this off, does my information become insecure?
[01:48:26.660 --> 01:48:27.660]   I haven't tried that.
[01:48:27.660 --> 01:48:28.660]   I'll give that a shot.
[01:48:28.660 --> 01:48:29.660]   I don't think so.
[01:48:29.660 --> 01:48:30.660]   I'm using it and she's quite secure.
[01:48:30.660 --> 01:48:34.260]   But that's the setting we're supposed to turn off.
[01:48:34.260 --> 01:48:35.260]   Yeah.
[01:48:35.260 --> 01:48:36.260]   Oh, see?
[01:48:36.260 --> 01:48:37.260]   And then it says--
[01:48:37.260 --> 01:48:38.260]   I'm not touching that one.
[01:48:38.260 --> 01:48:39.260]   No, see?
[01:48:39.260 --> 01:48:40.260]   Your Apple Pay cards will be removed.
[01:48:40.260 --> 01:48:41.820]   Also, maybe that's the wrong one.
[01:48:41.820 --> 01:48:42.820]   I'll double check.
[01:48:42.820 --> 01:48:43.820]   Boy, that's really the wrong one.
[01:48:43.820 --> 01:48:44.820]   I'll find it.
[01:48:44.820 --> 01:48:45.820]   Yeah, because she's still using Apple Pay.
[01:48:45.820 --> 01:48:48.580]   And there's activate on wrist raise, but you don't get to choose-- you don't get to turn
[01:48:48.580 --> 01:48:49.580]   it off.
[01:48:49.580 --> 01:48:50.580]   You only get to choose what you see.
[01:48:50.580 --> 01:48:53.140]   Yeah, I'll find the right article for you.
[01:48:53.140 --> 01:48:54.380]   Oh, it's in an article.
[01:48:54.380 --> 01:48:56.060]   Well, I should just probably read the Apple Watch if you--
[01:48:56.060 --> 01:48:57.060]   That's free to have for the call.
[01:48:57.060 --> 01:48:58.220]   Yeah, I'm more.com.
[01:48:58.220 --> 01:48:59.220]   I've heard of that.
[01:48:59.220 --> 01:49:00.540]   Thank you, everybody, for being here.
[01:49:00.540 --> 01:49:06.980]   We do Mac Break Weekly every Tuesday, 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern Time, 1800 UTC,
[01:49:06.980 --> 01:49:07.980]   on live.twit.tv.
[01:49:07.980 --> 01:49:12.860]   Love it if you're in the chatroom at IRC.twit.tv during the show, because as you can see, we
[01:49:12.860 --> 01:49:13.760]   pay attention.
[01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:15.300]   We listen.
[01:49:15.300 --> 01:49:17.100]   And it's valuable information for us.
[01:49:17.100 --> 01:49:21.020]   By the way, chatroom tells me, Andy, that you'll get better battery life if you turn your
[01:49:21.020 --> 01:49:26.820]   wall microsoft band facing-- risk side, facing in.
[01:49:26.820 --> 01:49:28.620]   So it only picks up every third heartbeat.
[01:49:28.620 --> 01:49:29.620]   I don't know.
[01:49:29.620 --> 01:49:34.220]   Yeah, I've only had this for-- I've not mastered the tips and tricks of this yet.
[01:49:34.220 --> 01:49:39.220]   I've also had someone tell me that it's easier to read if you have the screen on the inside.
[01:49:39.220 --> 01:49:40.220]   Yeah, that's crazy.
[01:49:40.220 --> 01:49:42.700]   And maybe it's also harder for other people to see your notifications if you've got it
[01:49:42.700 --> 01:49:43.700]   on the inside too.
[01:49:43.700 --> 01:49:44.700]   So I will definitely move it around like that.
[01:49:44.700 --> 01:49:46.420]   Thank you very much for that tip.
[01:49:46.420 --> 01:49:47.420]   See, chatroom?
[01:49:47.420 --> 01:49:48.420]   See, we do listen.
[01:49:48.420 --> 01:49:49.420]   We do.
[01:49:49.420 --> 01:49:50.620]   If you can't be here live though, don't worry.
[01:49:50.620 --> 01:49:52.420]   We have on-demand audio and video after the fact.
[01:49:52.420 --> 01:49:56.780]   Always at twit.tv/mbw as we do for all shows.
[01:49:56.780 --> 01:50:01.980]   And you can subscribe on iTunes or the podcast app on your iPhone and iPad or overcast or
