[00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:54.980]   We're still celebrating the news from Apple from two weeks ago Renee Richie's here though. That's how we know there's no news from Apple
[00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:02.240]   This is the week where we usually get double wc announcements and maybe it's not today
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.240]   Maybe it's tomorrow, but last year it was March 30th. Really? I got my fingers crossed
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.620]   Yeah, but it's usually in June like June 6th or 7th or 8th, right?
[00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:15.040]   Yes, they'll announce it though. Yeah, but they would announce it now. So you could what buy your plane tickets?
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.200]   You think it'll be like talk for a good 34 minutes. Yeah, there you go
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.640]   Like you're taking something I mean that'd be something I'll be something also here Andy Inako. He's on a hot spot today
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.040]   How hot is yeah?
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.000]   I'm just I'm just having my fights with infrastructure this week. That's all
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.120]   infrastructure battles continue in beautiful downtown Rhode Island and
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.240]   Because Rhode Island so small they're really anywhere in it. It's downtown
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.320]   and and from
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.680]   Beautiful Marin County. They have Montreal. We have New England and we have no Marin County
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:00.160]   I walk a ranch because office hours dot global Maven Alex Lindsey. Hello Alex. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. How are you?
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.720]   Doing well doing well
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.400]   so I
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.240]   Got my Mac studio that yesterday that was fun plugged it in
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.960]   Turned it on
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.120]   Done, it'll look like your Mac mini got swole is that what it looks like? Yeah, I like it
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.640]   Love it sitting there and I just leave it on
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:26.120]   Because I'm running a air message with it so I can get my my eye messages on my Android phone. Thank you EU and
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.960]   So I don't want to turn it off. So the screen goes up. Hey, but I got a question
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.760]   So I'm using the HDMI port to drive this 4k monitor
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.520]   this gaming monitor
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.040]   HDR
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:46.960]   But it doesn't look that good and I don't think it'll go past 60 hertz even though the monitor will is that that's it
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.960]   That's cuz Apple did not put HDMI 2.1 on
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.720]   On this computer. Am I right Renee?
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.800]   Do you think HDMI 2.0 should sub oh I see my 2.1 doesn't support anything anymore
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.960]   It's like I mean everything literally all it's all imaginary anyway, everything is optional
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.440]   Yeah, it's almost frustrating thing, but I think you can go up to 120 on HDMI 2.0
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.880]   It doesn't offer me that so maybe it doesn't know that the monitor can do it or something
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.640]   Anyway, back's a notoriously great a game. It'd be better. Yeah, no
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.960]   I know but but well and this is what I've heard from people who have the studio display is I would really love
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:23.200]   Promotion I'd love to have that higher frame rate that I have on my iPad and my iPhone and even my Mac book
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:29.560]   That's a that's a pro display though. That's gonna cost a lot more money and it's gonna have to drive a lot more bandwidth. So right
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.160]   Careful what you would yeah now. I can do it's a 4k. I'm driving a non Apple 4k
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:40.000]   Which should theory should be able to but anyway, I don't know the rumor is it's gonna be 7k for 7k
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.400]   Yeah, of course
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.400]   Of course
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.320]   730 number
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.440]   Well cuz you need to like you need to be pixel accurate
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:56.080]   So it's 24 inches for 4k so 21.5 for 4k 24 for 4.5 k 27 for 5k
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:04.800]   20 32 for 6k and then 36 for 7k or you go off-grid in Apple who would want everybody everybody's watching on their phone
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.960]   Anyway, why do these people?
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.960]   Who would want because the phone people are docile. It's the Mac nerds. I'll cut you what is the deal with?
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.320]   5 not 4 and
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.440]   7 not 8 native resolution is
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.520]   Is that it that they can't get monitors that have that?
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:27.160]   Yeah, like if you go read the blogs of all the human interface developers all the app designers all of our little developer friends
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:32.880]   And they will tell you exactly why their eyeballs will never look at anything that falls off the pixel grid ever again. Hmm
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.720]   All right, so there's a good explanation for it all. It's nice, but I have to say it's no fat
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.720]   It's no slower. I have a
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:46.160]   Max which by the way if you'd asked me six months ago. I would have said who I would have coveted it
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.000]   Now I want the ultra which Lisa has and I don't I don't detect it
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   I am not doing photogrammetry Alex. I want you to send me that
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.320]   Cinema I'm gonna get that done this weekend. Yeah last week got away from us. No, no, you've got other stuff to do this is a
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.160]   This week. Yeah, I'm just 30 90 card with
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:10.400]   AI it was what's it called video enhance AI topaz video enhance AI we were beating it by a good 15 seconds
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:16.000]   Which made me scrappy. Oh, that's neat. Well now they've got the 30 90 TI's for only $4,000. So I
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.800]   Was re I was turning Steve Jobs keynotes like the original Mac mini keynote into 4k glorious 4k
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:29.040]   Really fast. I definitely think it's it's it's a lot about what the software is optimized for. Yeah, I mean
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.640]   I think that's really what we're gonna find. I think you're absolutely right and
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:38.120]   For single-core software of which we still have a majority of its predominant
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.760]   There's no difference at a Macbook Air and my and Lisa's ultra right so
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.520]   That's kind of you know, I should have bought a man book
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:52.520]   You're gonna you're gonna throw more around than a Macbook Air would handle within its thermal envelope
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:56.960]   Like you're gonna go over 20 minutes on a sustained load at some point. You're gonna be happy with this Leo
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.440]   It'll be a good home theater machine for you
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:06.360]   Well, okay, that's our news
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:15.320]   You mentioned the EU though, I have so I have so many hot. Oh, we should probably talk about this. Okay, so hot take time EU
[00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.360]   the European Union as it's known the
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:27.120]   Shindian nations have provisionally agreed on a law that would force Apple and anybody big enough
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:32.880]   anybody with annual sales of seven and a half billion euros 45 million monthly users and
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:36.960]   And a value of more than eighty three billion dollars
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:41.160]   So I think Google and Apple both qualify there to have it don't count Ireland
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:49.160]   Don't don't count Ireland and they will have to have a bunch of stuff
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.240]   Third-party app stores is the big one
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.280]   allowing app developers access to
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:05.000]   Features that historically have maybe been kept private like for a long time Apple kept an FC private although it's now available now
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.560]   Right that means Apple would have to write a
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:12.360]   Framework for all of the hardware that they have in the phone
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:19.840]   So this is a non trivial process ensure that users have the right to unsubscribe from core platform services as
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.520]   Easily as they subscribed I
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:27.640]   Think Apple's pretty good on that one. I don't think we have to worry about that. That's more. That's more apps and stuff
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:31.320]   Not required default
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:34.080]   Web browsers
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.800]   Messengers all of that stuff on installation the operating system
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:41.680]   Make sure and this is one that some people have said I'll be very curious what you guys think
[00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:47.720]   Implies that Apple would have to open messages to WhatsApp and other messaging
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:54.800]   Products it's sure the interoperability of their instant messaging services and this is important basic functionalities
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.200]   So that's I guess up opened interpretation
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:01.760]   Give sellers access to their marketing or advertising performance data on the platform
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:08.200]   Inform the EU about acquisitions and mergers you can't rack your products or services higher than those of others
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:14.480]   That's more aimed at Google. I think you know with Google shopping. They were in trouble for that with the EU some years ago
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.720]   Reuse private data collected during a service
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:22.320]   Is that religious services? I don't know for the purposes of another service
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:28.400]   Okay, unclear unclear establish unfair conditions for business users. That's pretty broad
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:33.880]   Preinstall certain software applications and you can't require this is the big one
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:40.480]   For Apple anyway, this is the one they fought tooth and nail require app developers install phone dot app like I have so many questions about
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:44.960]   Oh, yeah, that's a good question. Should I be should I have to allow a third-party dialer?
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:54.280]   You can use third-party dollars on nandred. I think yeah require app developers to use certain services for example payment systems or identity providers
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.960]   In order to be listed in app stores in other words
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:02.060]   You can't force them to use the Apple App Store or Apple payment systems rather
[00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:06.400]   The fines are six hundred ten percent of revenue
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:13.560]   Ten percent of global revenue for repeat offense twenty percent of global revenue. That's enough
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:17.400]   That's a that's not a five million euro a week fine. That's a that's a
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.240]   hefty
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.680]   amount of money, okay
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:25.640]   I'm done talking. What do you think but Renee you said you wanted to talk about this? I'll start with you
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.800]   Yeah, so I mean in general
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:33.520]   I think there's a lot of stuff here that absolutely needs regulation my constant fear with the EU is that they don't always approach this from
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:38.960]   strategically smart or informed positions and I would only point you to browser ballots and cookie disclosures and
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:42.120]   GDPR that stops small companies from even being able to
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:49.640]   You can't all the legislation and this again. It's overly broad as unspecified. It's not specific and it doesn't
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:55.840]   I worry that it's gonna do a lot of harm rather than a lot of good or maybe in the course of doing good for example
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:58.880]   Just messages interoperability even at a basic level
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.080]   There is huge questions about what that means for end-to-end encryption
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:05.640]   Which cynics among us would say maybe is the whole point of them wanting to push it
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:09.080]   But even things like I don't use Facebook and right now
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:13.800]   I use iMessage or signal because end-to-end encryption is really important to me and privacy is important to me
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:19.680]   but if you know somebody decides they're gonna switch to what's app or to Facebook messenger and
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:22.920]   It's just gonna automatically interoperate so
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:28.000]   Interoperable into interoperate and then they'll get my messages and Facebook will have my data
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.640]   And we already have email that does that and messages was sort of the opposite of that and I'm afraid
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:37.480]   We're gonna lose a lot of stuff just because they're not well-informed or careful about how they legislate it
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:46.080]   Is a weird thing for a government to make what is essentially a big technical decision for these companies for instance amendment 127?
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:52.520]   This is from Benedict Evans tweet proposal for regulation article 6 paragraph 1 point F a parenthesis new
[00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:56.600]   Yeah, you should do all of this without
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:04.400]   While guaranteeing a high level of security and personal data protection and I think a backdoor only we can access
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:08.560]   Apple would argue this is you know, absolutely gonna impact
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:15.160]   Security this is the this is for the interoperability between messaging providers. Go ahead Andy. I know you wanted to talk
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.640]   I'm sorry. Yeah, no, I mean that I'm with Renee here
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:24.880]   I'm there a lot of there are a lot of intentions in this in this measure that I absolutely support I do think that
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.000]   I've been saying for a long time that
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.600]   the largest tech companies Apple included have been
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:36.880]   Maybe sailing along on the pretext that we will never be regulated
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:40.160]   We will always be able to do exactly what we want to do when we want to do it
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:48.320]   We will never be answerable to any outside influence and they realize they don't realize exactly how much these large companies have benefited from that
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:52.640]   The internet has benefited from it users have benefited from it
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:59.800]   But we're entered we have long since entered a date where this helps large companies stay large and small companies stay either
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.240]   Acquired or become dead. However
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.720]   This is so broad
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:10.760]   And all the different all the different earmarks that's trying to achieve that it does seem that it's almost impossible
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:19.160]   for a company the scale of Apple or or Google to just basically conduct business does it does this mean for I
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:23.440]   Was reading I was trying to read through the entire thing and part of it made me think that okay
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:26.840]   So if a developer decides that they don't want to use Xcode anymore
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:33.520]   They want to use code warrior does that mean that Apple has to allow people to develop apps using whatever code system that they
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:40.000]   That they want to develop is this open season for any developer or any industry with any sort of a beef
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   Against Apple or Google to simply say we're gonna sue you because we want to be able to do whatever we want to do
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:52.360]   Form and you can't say boo about it because you're gonna have to you're gonna have to answer to the EU about it
[00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.640]   I think that the only way for a company like Apple to
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.520]   continue to
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:04.160]   Be as good as it is under these limitations is it simply say okay EU congratulations
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:11.240]   We're gonna create a whole version of iOS a whole version of Mac OS a whole version of our systems for you
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:17.120]   That don't do very much the people in the United States and outside the EU are gonna get the whole schmagilla
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:22.600]   And it's gonna be awesome and your guys gonna hate it. You're gonna hate how hard it's gonna be to
[00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:26.840]   To keep your your your keep spam messages off of your device
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:31.200]   You're gonna hate how hard it is to keep malware off of your phone
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:36.400]   You're gonna you're gonna talk to any of your cousins in the United States and either your cousins in China
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:43.720]   China India anywhere and you're gonna say why the hell is the EU doing this to me personally instead of
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:48.920]   Instead of the EU saying here are some men that we would like to put we like to put some limits on
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:57.080]   The power of trillion dollar companies you're there instead basically ensuring that they're gonna become an archipelago of sadness
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:00.760]   I should point out that the provisional agreement is
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:06.040]   Not yet law it has to be approved by the council and the European Parliament and
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:11.440]   Then after its entry to force it. There's another six months before it has to be implemented
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:16.360]   So it is just a proposal so there's still time to to change the provisions Alex
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.360]   I'm sure wants to say something I'm gonna be Alex a chance
[00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:24.880]   Oh, I'll say six months is an insanely short what they're asking for it's an insanely short runway
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:31.040]   You know, but we have to realize the politicians are you know, basically they're not tech toddlers. Yeah, they're technical toddlers
[00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:35.280]   You know, they're they they have no idea what they're doing and then what they have is a bunch of well
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:40.640]   I would say differently. I would agree with Andy that they're trying to enforce a societal good
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:47.000]   But the problem is it's hard for them to understand what they're saying what the implications be for instance a lot of
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:49.320]   Geographers say that this is gonna break
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:52.440]   Cryptography in apps like what's app?
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:58.320]   The thing is that this is this is this is like having a 12 year old do open heart surgery
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.200]   You know, like we know that there's a problem
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.560]   But we're gonna give someone who doesn't know anything about what they're doing
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:07.640]   Maybe they read some books and wants to gee how's there but they don't know how to actually do what they're doing
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:13.160]   Because we surely you're not saying the companies should self-regulate. They're not
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.920]   Well, I don't know if the
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.920]   I think that I'm as a user
[00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:22.360]   I think that I'm better off with the way it is right now as a small developer
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:26.360]   I'm better off as the way it is right now as a large rich developer
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:31.960]   I'm better off with the new rules because I can now do all the things I can do to make more money as an intelligence agency
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.960]   I'm way better off
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:40.040]   So we understand where the pressures coming from the intelligent the five eyes
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:46.480]   This would be clear, you know, the intelligence agencies the that's that's the big push on
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:52.840]   Politicians to do this because they have to crack this up because Apple is like three revisions away from cutting them out completely
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:56.960]   The so the the issue is is that we have they're going down this path
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:01.400]   It's sometimes it's better to do nothing than to then to stick your hand into it if you got a sitting doctor
[00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:03.160]   They're gonna be like well, we're not sure what we're doing
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.720]   We might not go do it
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:08.120]   And this is something that is going to have a huge impact on a lot of people again
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:13.480]   For the large rich developers and the intelligence agencies. This is a boom. You know, boom
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:19.760]   This is great for them for small developers the problem is you look at Apple TV the Apple the TV OS is a disaster
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:25.040]   Because they let all these folks you can log in this way and you can sign up for this and you can do it
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:30.240]   And you know what I do is I don't even go to the app store anymore there like the TV OS app store is dead to me because
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:35.840]   You know unless there's some new, you know because the problem is is that and I really thought about this over the last
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:40.680]   Couple weeks is that is that I don't use that Iowa. I don't use the TV OS at all
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:46.520]   Because it's too full of weird sign-ups, you know, and that's what's coming
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:49.520]   You know CNN plus came out and I guess and Scott, you know
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:53.080]   And I opened it up and and I looked at it and had a weird sign in
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:54.920]   You know, I was like here comes, you know
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:59.320]   Here are the weird signings that we have to deal with and the problem is the problem for Apple is a money issue
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:05.040]   Not so much with the apps the 15% I realized that the reason I don't update my computer every two years
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:08.800]   I usually wait five years for my main computer to upload upgrade. It's the apps
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.160]   It's it's the installs like I look at it go
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:17.040]   I don't have two days to like find all of my serial numbers and find all the stuff like all the apples all the stuff from the
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:23.960]   App Store just loads in but you know and so the reason that I think one of the reasons people update their phones all the time is because it's easy
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.120]   You know and we do when we take that away
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:28.320]   It's not gonna be as fun
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:33.400]   So one of the things I like to do is I like to make sure that I challenge my opinion all the time because I have a lot of beliefs
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:39.560]   I want to make sure they're loosely held so I went around and looked and one of my favorite people who has like I believe in gatekeeper on iOS
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:43.680]   I don't think it'll make the huge difference some people think it'll make but I believe in it as a philosophy and
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:47.560]   Riley's Riley test that and I'm gonna pronounce that wrong. I apologize
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:51.160]   He's the one who's been doing the alternative App Store on iOS for a long time now
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:53.680]   And I like a lot of his views on it
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:56.480]   But even he was worried about this and he tweeted out that
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.720]   sideloading can't allow new apps to exist
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.440]   but it shouldn't affect those who explicitly choose a curated secure platform and
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:07.120]   Forcing Apple to allow alternative App Store is great for giant companies like Facebook and Epic
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:09.120]   but it's much worse for consumers and
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:14.220]   For good or for ill the example everybody's using is we have app tracking transparency for example
[00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:21.200]   But what happens when a company like Facebook who has the five most popular apps or five of the ten most popular apps on iOS decides?
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.520]   They don't want to follow those rules anymore
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.760]   And they pull them off and say here's a new Facebook App Store for you
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:30.520]   And it's not right. It's not it's not regulated by anything like what an iPhone user expects
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:34.160]   You know, it's exactly by a Nova VPN rules of practice
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:38.320]   Exactly this is exactly what I've been talking about for the last I don't know how many months
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:47.320]   You know, but this is this is exactly the problem is that though that these larger companies will force us off the platform
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:50.080]   Or we'll just have to give up on their on their platform
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:53.480]   You know and that's that's gonna put a lot of pressure and it's not gonna be user friendly
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:56.480]   um
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:07.040]   Does feel like there are reasons what isn't SMS a form of interoperability, I know it's not encrypted
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:10.480]   But isn't it great? Yeah, well, it's not encrypted at all
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:18.120]   But that is a form of it. I mean a number of people have pointed this out in our Twitter community and so forth is yeah
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.120]   But you do have SMS
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:27.200]   Interoperability is that I do that's already that's a mix it already makes it all interoperable. Yeah, well, that's that's that cuts
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:31.800]   That cuts to the heart of the problems with the with the proposal as it's written right now
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:37.760]   They don't whether there's are they talking about feature for feature interoperability or they are simply saying that it's okay
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.640]   It's okay for it's okay
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:45.080]   If the if the messages app can simply send a message to the Android stock messaging app
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:48.440]   It doesn't have to have all the features of of iMessage network
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:51.760]   but the again my problem with this is
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:59.080]   essentially it turns the EU court system into a bludgeon against Apple and all these companies because because
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:07.080]   Imagine it's not Google imagine. It's the smaller company saying that I insist that you support my I created
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.720]   I created this very very small messaging messaging system
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.760]   I want you I want you to sue I'm gonna sue Apple
[00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:18.200]   I want you to force them to allow me to have access to the polite message stack and even though even if the courts say no
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:25.280]   The Apple doesn't have to do that. That's a whole bunch of time and effort and money that Apple has to do to basically defend off these BS
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:26.880]   BS
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:28.880]   Actions against them. So yeah
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:34.640]   Or it's Trump or it's Bill Gates or it's Putin or it's Elon Musk or it's a call from Sacramento's new three-day
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:37.360]   You know, I message coding problem and suddenly
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:43.040]   Platform and also like it's interesting because you can tack you can handle these things at a platform level too
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:48.760]   Like Palm Synergy and Blackberry Hub did a wonderful job of totally abstracting away what service you were using
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:53.720]   It would just project it would just like present to you what their preferred service was and if you didn't want it
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:54.840]   You didn't have to engage with it
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:57.400]   But if you did you would just you would just go to this one place
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:02.160]   You'd have every person and you could send the messages through their preferred way of being messaged and that seems like
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:02.960]   a
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.960]   By the way, I mean doing all this
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:10.880]   Maybe this is the answer, but on Android I can use almost any messenger as my SMS
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:16.040]   Platform in fact including signal. So if I know it'll just come back to green green bubbles
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:20.880]   Like I think that that's that's the thing that keeps people out of things is not so much and you can make them all
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:26.680]   Interoperable it's the green bubble. It's the green bubble. They don't like I mean that you do make a strong point
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:30.720]   Which is that it is there are we don't know if it's the intelligence agencies
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:35.400]   but there are definitely stakeholders that compete with Apple that are pushing the EU in this direction and
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:39.360]   You know, that's I think the EU's
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.920]   Response to people who want to compete with Apple without actually competing in the marketplace
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:46.520]   So I think that's one thing fundamentally
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:49.560]   I think that you use trying to find some way that European countries come
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:55.360]   European companies can compete with the American companies that they're all that they're trying to right, you know
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:59.320]   How do we crack that open a little bit you've companies like Spotify and other things?
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:03.320]   That's not fair and I think it's possible to do any of this without compromising
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:06.760]   Privacy and security or do you think that that's just a non-starter?
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:10.280]   Alex I think that you need to I think that
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:15.960]   For messages or interoperability you seem to be able to as a user turn it off in fact
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:20.040]   It probably should be off by default of I'm not gonna be able to do it and then you can turn it on
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:20.800]   I want to win
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:23.800]   Yeah, you want to do it and take a chance you can do that
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:29.000]   So you just want to kind of but I think that what Renee mentioned earlier is problematic in the in the in that area
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.520]   So, you know like that you could accidentally suddenly start be talking to somebody that isn't
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:39.400]   Inside of that system and I think that for me I would rather keep on using the different message systems in their own silo
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:44.760]   For what they're good for not rather than trying to I mean half my front page of my iPhone is all
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:48.080]   Is all different messages
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:54.560]   Stop that I mean don't you want to get to one messenger that can get messages for everybody
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:58.600]   Like a fight member idiom
[00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:01.640]   I mean, you know somebody
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:10.120]   Kev Brewer in in our discourse our club to a discourse said in window when windows phone came out windows the original windows phone
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:14.960]   You had a tile to connect collected all the messengers and Google and Apple and everybody else didn't like it
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.640]   So they made sure that that wasn't possible. So
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:20.480]   Yeah, I would like to have one messenger
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:26.080]   Program that could handle all the good news I just the problem is is that we school messengers
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:30.600]   The problem is is that trying to get get the get the happen you get back to the green bubble problem
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:36.280]   Which is that'll be always slow as common denominator each one of these has their own way of doing things and they're interesting in their own way
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:42.880]   You know and and I am modal in how I use different these different pieces and what I expect them to do when I'm doing them
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:47.480]   Well, and I'm fine with I'm fine with that because that's where that's one of battles for customer
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:54.720]   Convenience, I mean that does not sound like an ideal that sounds as bad as having a log into different CNN plus and different
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:57.280]   I mean really are you kidding me? Yeah
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:02.240]   But the thing is is that is that we already there this is it's one thing to crack something up
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:06.200]   That's already been built as a unified structure and another one to take a whole bunch of things that have grown
[00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:10.000]   These have all grown up like little weeds all and you're not trying to pull them together
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.400]   It's just that if yeah sure if we did that all at the very beginning
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:18.520]   That's not quite the actual history so it used to they were interoperable and then companies decided they wanted to silo it
[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:21.480]   It in fact, it's the opposite from email which has by the way
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:26.080]   Figured out a way to interoperate used to be you kind of well pretty well
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:30.640]   Used to be if you were on copies serve you couldn't email genie or MCI mail well they were
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:33.800]   Emulated that right well, I don't think it was regulation. I think it was standards
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:37.480]   I don't know that's a catch they said if you're gonna merge you have to make it
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:40.880]   Well, there was a merger going on and they said if you're gonna merge these two companies you have to make them in our
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:45.760]   I'm Warner you have to make him it but the other thing that's that super news is that Apple actually did go to the carriers
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:50.440]   They had SMS and they were super upset because they couldn't compete with all the features that were coming out and all these other
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:52.040]   Messages like what's happened?
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:54.800]   They went to the carrier Scott Forest all talked about this and one of his interviews
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:59.600]   And he said can we do this can we add this and they said no no no and I and they in Steve just said fine
[00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:04.120]   We're gonna do it ourselves and then he started rolling out these features and could have had a very different history
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:10.040]   Yeah, you know the thing is is that I think that again the app store only talking about breaking up an app store
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:12.040]   The app store is a pretty unified
[00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:17.960]   That came up from from scratch builds a certain way and so tearing it apart and starting to try to make it work differently
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:22.840]   I think is complicated and probably won't work. I agree with that on that. I don't know if it's so
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:30.200]   Yeah, it'll be complicated and it'll stink for small developers and for users. You know, that's that's what we're pretty guaranteed
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:32.200]   and then the
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:33.600]   the
[00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:39.160]   So that's I mean, that's that's a different situation than having a whole bunch of things that all of us have been using for the last decade
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:44.440]   And trying to figure out what's the common thread between all of these and they all have very different
[00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:51.320]   Ways of approaching things and then you know, it's so it's just it's as complicated and painful to do it well
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:55.920]   It would be you'd have to get them all to agree. We're all gonna have these features and we're all gonna have these things
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:27:01.400]   And all you can really get them to agree on is pushing text back and forth, you know about how they're gonna handle that and so I think that
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:05.360]   So I think that's what we'll do it says basic
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:10.760]   So it'll be you can put your thumb up you can put your thumb down you can put a heart you can put text back and forth
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:13.760]   Okay, we're done like that. So that's all that's gonna happen here. I think
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:16.920]   Yeah, well, nobody would complain about that right?
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:19.660]   I mean that was already doing fine as long as I can turn it off you
[00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:23.300]   I don't think as long as I can turn it off. I'm okay. So sorry. Really? I
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:25.840]   Said can I introduce you to Twitter?
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:30.520]   That's another story entirely man, I was
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:34.260]   I was on Twitter during the Academy of words did that
[00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:36.900]   what
[00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:42.160]   Holy cow I didn't pay any attention to it. I was I was a blissful Sunday evening of editing videos for me
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:46.620]   Yes a good argument for not having Twitter open who the Oscars who
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:51.160]   Well, actually the Oscars are fun. You missed out on some fireworks
[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:56.280]   You didn't need to because we had Twitter. Yeah, it's true. Yeah, yeah
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:02.880]   Cross the streams go ahead it goes back to that Craig Mason thing where he said that Twitter makes him feel like he has to immediately
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:05.540]   Express a very loud obnoxious opinion about something
[00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:10.280]   He knows nothing about otherwise he misses out on everything and it's like this constant source of anxiety
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:12.640]   So I just decided I don't need to have opinions on these things Leo
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:16.880]   I'll focus on a very small set of things that I actually pay attention to and the rest of the world can go by
[00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.880]   That's actually very wise
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:24.080]   Health conscious decision good good good on you for doing that
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:27.320]   Unfortunately as point you we have to have opinions on everything
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:31.820]   You know what they say they say that I like to quote my my philosopher daughter said, you know
[00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:35.720]   Fear leads to anger anger leads to hate and hate the Twitter
[00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:40.320]   Frank Oz was upset like when you know it gets mad at you
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:49.040]   Let's take a break and then we'll talk about the Oscars because Apple had a good night a

[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:10.520]   but the thrill of risking it all is best enjoyed as they say in moderation like
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:14.920]   Street food and casino gambling if you're playing the market

[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.320]   Perhaps you did know
[00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:58.280]   Renee richy that apple won best picture oscar for his movie
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:05.560]   Coda press release you saw the press release actually you were so happy you know some people were saying see tim cooks a genius
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:08.600]   They didn't produce coda. They didn't
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:15.720]   Order coda. They bought it at sundance where it was a big winner in sundance and they spent some money not a lot actually
[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:19.400]   I think it was 25 million dollars to buy it. I mean not a lot
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:21.320]   For apple
[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:23.160]   Anyway, apparently there was
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:27.720]   Spend it on a rock action movie that we Netflix would have yeah, it was a little bit of strategy involved
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:31.400]   There was some apparently some bidding according to the wall street journal, but apples
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:38.120]   Because this is the story coda oscars win caps apples
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:39.960]   I
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:48.040]   Can throw this is I'm hard to parse this title coda oscars win caps apples quality over quantity approach in other words
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:50.040]   They don't have the catalog
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:53.080]   They can't compete with netflix or walt Disney for that
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:55.000]   but
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   If you can pick well
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.520]   You can have winners at a best picture oscar first one for a streamer
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:03.240]   although again to get
[00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:07.800]   To get eligibility they had to put it a brief run in a few theaters
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:12.680]   Leo did you mean caps like I would gen x caps like kill something or I was like
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:17.080]   Tenneal with the Oscars. You don't know these days. It could be either one
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:20.920]   Caught coda oscars win caps apples quality
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:27.240]   Um, I think they mean this is they're trying to write like variety. I don't know. This is the wall street journal. Use it use english
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:32.920]   Please uh, but they're basically saying is that apple has done everything right in terms of acquisitions
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:38.200]   They have validates validates good better word you're welcome wall street journal. Thank you
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:40.680]   You're editing the journal me and I don't come cheap
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:48.200]   Helmed helmed see that they're using these variety words helmed by former sony tv executives
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:51.560]   apple tv plus has made plenty of deals with big name talent
[00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:58.040]   But in this case, this was uh, this was spotting a winner at sundance and saying we'll we'll take it and having the checkbook
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:59.960]   frankly to
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:01.560]   to buy it
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:05.000]   Now i'm looking through it to make sure doesn't say the oscarred on sunday and podium deferral
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.120]   yeah
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:15.000]   But the other the other part of this is that um, it's it isn't just writing the check to get the movie
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.960]   It's also waging an oscar campaign that lasts
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:21.320]   And months and months could go like coda coda was like a
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:24.520]   Coda was an outsider. It really
[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:29.240]   According according to people who've been like sunday morning money morning quarterbacking its win
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:33.880]   Uh in the in the trades. They've been talking about how it was it came up
[00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:37.080]   It was one of those courses that comes out that starts bad
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:41.000]   But then like finishes very very strongly for reasons that are unfathomable
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:47.800]   And but that doesn't happen unless they unless the the distributor pushes pushes pushes pushes pushes this nomination
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:50.120]   Uh, and then capitalizes on it
[00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:55.560]   The thing but the the thing that i keep wondering about is about the these kind of things is that yes apple
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:34:01.320]   got a certain amount of like reflected prestige on the fact that yes, they were the people who
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:03.960]   wrote the check for it
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:10.760]   Excuse me wrote the check for it to appear on apple tv. They bought it. They didn't like pay for it. They didn't produce it. They wasn't their idea
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:15.320]   Exactly. Yeah, it's not like ted lasso where they where they basically
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:18.280]   They basically allowed this thing to happen
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:20.680]   the the question is
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:22.680]   is it bringing in enough viewers to
[00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:28.440]   justify all the expense and is the luster of a reflected oscar win enough to
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:30.920]   Enough to to truck the idea of well
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:32.120]   It's a that's their advantage
[00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:36.360]   That's their nose because netflix has to get has to get the money back, right?
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:41.240]   Uh, but apple what they're more like amazon in that case. This is a prestige product
[00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:46.520]   So I think that it judged 25 million to get an oscar or whatever the plus whatever they spent on advertising
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:50.760]   That's for apples, but it makes the services valuable. I think
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:56.600]   What what what i'm getting at though is that like there are enough people actually watching that movie and to think that
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:01.800]   Apple tv is a has a valuable position on my uh on my streaming box
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:05.720]   Yeah, this is a channel. I keep turning too frequently whereas whereas hulu
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:13.320]   Uh for instance, uh, I I watched bobs burgers last night. I got caught up on archer and uh last and last weekend
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:19.160]   I wrote death on excuse me. I read death on the Nile specifically because the movie is coming to hulu today
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:26.200]   Hulu is actually a dark horse that's coming up strong. There's I noticed we're watching a lot of shows like uh the dropout that there are no
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:28.200]   Story, yeah
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:31.880]   But I I didn't think it's a word go ahead. Go ahead. I'll say is
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:35.480]   Awards are talent acquisition. Like that's what you're doing
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:38.120]   Right, so you don't care about how many people are watching coda
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:40.200]   It's the fact that you won an academy award
[00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:45.160]   Changes the way apple gets seen by the directors and the actors and uh, you know, that type of thing
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:48.200]   That's that's what there. This is you know, the academy is an inside game
[00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:53.720]   You know, and so it's who gets hired for the next thing, you know, and all of those all those little bits and pieces
[00:35:53.720 --> 00:36:00.120]   So academy award winning streaming services is you know to win the best other people have won awards and apples winning
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:04.280]   But that's why they play so hard is because they have to get they want to get the martin score says he's the
[00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:10.520]   the uh, frances for copa as the you know, the um, you know the ones that you're trying to kind of break down the
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:12.120]   um
[00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:15.960]   You know the folks that are that still are saying who it has to go out to theater
[00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:20.360]   You're trying to crack that wall and every in every week. I mean every award is another brick
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:26.440]   You know cracking that another slam on that wall between theaters and between streaming which they they're trying to work out
[00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:32.520]   So it puts you above the other ones and so the other stuff follows along, but that's what they're that's what an award gets you
[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:35.480]   That's that's definitely that apple good
[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:40.040]   It's uh, i'm sorry latency's killing us. I apologize rene. Go ahead
[00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:44.360]   I was I was also gonna say that I think it's also like apple is willing to take a risk
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:49.560]   Like sure teddlasso is made by warner's and sure this movie was completely made before and there are other people bidding on it
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:54.040]   But apple has shown that they're willing to take a risk to put their money behind a lot of eclectic products
[00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:59.480]   They're almost like this artisanal craft thing that they're doing with apple arcade on the side as well
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:05.240]   And that's not always been common, especially like disney plus will give you all the marvel movies all the star wars movies
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:08.360]   All the muppet movies, but you know, you're not going to get star trek you're not going to get
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:10.440]   um
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:15.240]   DC movies you're not going to get like a lot of non franchise stuff and even netflix is putting a ton of money
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:22.840]   Behind very big like the rock movies very like summer block busery kind of movies and amazon is doing similar a lot of like
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:23.800]   uh
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:31.400]   action adventure series all sorts of things and apple's palette is completely almost completely non franchise and very very diverse and I think that
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:37.400]   They make it a point to to reflect their beliefs on accessibility and their beliefs on diversity and opportunity
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:43.640]   And I think they really want it to be first like they really wanted to be the first streaming service to an oscar because being the third one
[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:49.320]   Doesn't really mean as much as being first. I'm willing to put a lot of budget behind it and to any point
[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:51.480]   uh and and and Alex is
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:56.840]   uh, uh, martin's corsese or a francis for couple is looking at how much money apple spent on advertising
[00:37:56.840 --> 00:38:00.760]   To get the oscar for your consideration as another
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:05.880]   Plus right by the way, it's not just the only time the first time a streaming
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:13.080]   Uh movie has won it's the first time a sundance premiere movie has won. I didn't know that so, uh, it's also a big win for indies
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:15.960]   Um some have said
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:21.640]   Movies are dead not just some martin scorsese riddly scott and berry diller
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:26.760]   Three odd bedfellows have said really the idea of going to movies in the cinema
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:32.680]   Which was already kind of problem problematic is thanks to covid and pandemic
[00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:34.760]   really uh
[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:41.720]   Over as unless you have a big block what riddly scott doesn't like is that the comic universe is taking over
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:45.320]   Then in order to get people to go to the theaters you have to have a comic book
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:48.920]   Tyler an action. I guess a lot of us have been talking about this for 20 years
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:52.760]   Which is that eventually the the av systems at the houses were going to get good enough
[00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:59.880]   That you didn't that the only reason you'd go to a theater is for something that was bigger than that felt bigger than your house
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:04.440]   You know like that's the that's the reality and most of us i mean have been talking about this for 20 years
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:08.440]   So it's not this is nothing new. It's not like covid started this one's a comic trajectory that was coming
[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:12.680]   But as it happened because is it happening? Oh, yeah, it's covid. I mean sped it up for sure
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:14.600]   It's sped it up by by five or ten years
[00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:18.680]   But but it was it was going down this path because our screens are getting bigger higher resolution
[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:20.360]   We've got better sound systems
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:22.760]   We've got all these other things that are happening around us
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:25.560]   And the theaters didn't move fast enough forward
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:29.320]   I mean the only two theaters that are worth watching anything in is an iMacs or Dolby
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:31.640]   You know and so those are more alamo
[00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:35.720]   If you want to eat with it, I mean if you want to eat it tacos it's a problem
[00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:39.960]   But you want to get tacos too thanks to delivery services
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:45.240]   I can have tacos but I also I can make the tacos at home and then watch them and I can have you know and so better pop
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:47.240]   Quai thanks to you for sure
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:48.280]   I
[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:50.280]   Popquai's good much. So do I yeah
[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:55.240]   With you know the popcorn is really good with this is is hanks is the hanks salt salt hank
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:57.720]   Yeah, hanks which one salt hank is the truffle or like truffle?
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:59.960]   I always could give you the garlic truffle is really good with it
[00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:03.160]   It burns so you have to be very careful because it'll smoke up as soon as you put it in there
[00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:07.880]   In case you're wondering but anyway, yeah, you have that stuff has got in it that really good method of putting it in oil
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:11.880]   With the oil. Yeah, I like that. Yeah, so anyway, but but the um go back to this
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:14.520]   you know, I think that
[00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:20.440]   That you know these big theaters they have an opportunity to give you something that's this massive, you know over the top experience
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:25.000]   Um, so the the you know the Dolby cinemas and the iMacs theaters and so on so forth
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   They can do that but the average theater
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.080]   They're they're saving money on how how bright they push the bulb. They're playing it too low
[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:35.320]   They're you know, even they finally got to a point where they were letting us, you know, schedule our seats
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:37.480]   But it was too late, you know, like we you know
[00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:42.440]   And so so I think that they the theaters didn't invest fast enough into creating that kind of upper
[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:46.120]   Scale stuff that we had seen starting to show up in a lot of those theaters
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:48.120]   And so they just fell behind that cue
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:50.600]   And um, and so I so I think it's I think it is true
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:53.720]   I think that those theaters could provide other things that right now
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:57.960]   They're just a little overpriced, you know when you want if you want to do something in a theater system
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:00.840]   It's it can be very painful. So I think that the upper
[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:03.800]   Shell of this is going to work well. That means
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:08.440]   You know big action adventure, but also cinematic like big cinema
[00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:14.120]   Experiences it doesn't have to be well, that's why it's the marvel movies, right? That's why it's bad
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:21.560]   Marvel move that's why that's why that's why disney did such a great job in acquisition, you know between lucas film and and pixar and and uh
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:24.920]   Marvel yeah, they built it. They they saw the future they built the future
[00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:29.960]   Uh, and this is what martin square sazy is saying. He's saying cinema as I knew it, you know the small
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:35.720]   Uh, but but the thing I guess i would say those are gonna be in movie theaters anymore
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:39.960]   Yeah, but but he has to get over the movie theater thing like the thing is right i creeply see them too
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:42.440]   I agree, you know like it's you know and and you're more people
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:46.040]   You're more likely to take a chance on a movie when it's part of your subscription
[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:52.760]   Then then you are when you are going to have to pay you know for me to take my kids and my and my wife to the to the theater is a hundred
[00:41:52.760 --> 00:42:00.120]   Dollars, you know with popcorn and drinks and everything else and it's good. It's not as good. Not good for you either
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:02.520]   This stuff is horrible. Um, anyway, so the um
[00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:05.080]   Uh, so to do that though is a hundred bucks
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:09.480]   For for us to go to the theater that means that that movie has to be really good
[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:12.600]   And I think that's part of the problem is that going to the cinema has become a lot more expensive
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:16.680]   And so that movie has to be that much better and for me again if i'm gonna buy
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:23.480]   If i'm going to pay for it, I want to go to a a theater that's worth sitting down in number one and number two
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:29.400]   Is it's got to be a movie that's gonna take advantage of that theater and that's the and so for the artsy films
[00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:35.000]   To be honest, I'd rather watch them at home. Yeah, you know, at least I went to see the batman in the theater
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:41.640]   Uh first time in a while. She's been in a theater a couple of years and it was a horrible experience because the kids were taught kids
[00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:47.160]   Yes, it only took two years for kids to be de-socialized the kids were on their phones
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:50.440]   They were talking they were throwing food. Yeah, they're kids horrible
[00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:51.960]   Was it at an iMacs or was it at?
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:55.400]   Oh, just it was a night. We have a nice, you know, you know, the theater downtown
[00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:59.880]   Yeah, the stadium seating. It's a fairly nice theater on a big screen. It wasn't iMacs was very nice
[00:42:59.880 --> 00:43:04.840]   And I yeah, they don't see you probably don't see kids at the 35 dollar iMacs theater, but uh
[00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:08.440]   I haven't seen it yet. The work the work around the world
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:14.760]   I haven't seen it yet. I haven't had time to go to an iMacs theater. I mean, let's see. That's the point. When are you gonna go?
[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:18.280]   Yeah, whereas you can see it as soon as it's dreaming weeks
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:19.560]   You can sit down and watch it
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:24.440]   So we watched king Richard on our hundred inch screen with our surround sound system eating
[00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:27.000]   Alex lindsey popcorn and it was
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:31.800]   It was it was better than the movies. It was great and it was like the movies in that sense
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:37.240]   And there's a 45 window for HBO so it'll be on max like within like a month like right
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:43.960]   But I think Batman's a good example is I am going to go to see it on iMacs because I've heard that it's it's one of the best iMacs films
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:46.840]   That's been made. Oh really? So cool. Yeah, yeah, it's supposed to be really good
[00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:49.160]   And so so i'm i'm planning to go see it. You know see it there
[00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:52.680]   So there's things that i'll go I will go out of my there aren't my cave
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:55.560]   Ever in a while to go see something in the one of the things holding you back
[00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:57.400]   You have to drive into san francisco don't you know?
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:01.160]   I mean there aren't that many iMacs theaters in the country san francisco or sacramento
[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:04.600]   They're kind of when all is said and done. They're kind of equal distance from me
[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:08.920]   So yeah both of which should have an hour driver, you know, but that's you have parking and you get it
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:13.400]   Yeah, so it's there's definitely a disincentive, you know if it's if that's
[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:18.520]   The case I think this is very good for people who want to watch movie on their tv
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:25.320]   Uh, it's also very good for TVs. I have to say with my olehead tv. I feel like it's actually better than a theatrical experience
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:27.320]   You have Dolby station and Dolby um
[00:44:27.320 --> 00:44:31.720]   Surround at Dolby atmos at home like this. I watched it. Oh, I didn't see the movie theater was fantastic
[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:34.600]   Yeah, and you're 10 feet away from a 70 inch screen
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:38.680]   The screen is bigger unless you're unless you're in lister it and i'm actually sitting right up front
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:46.280]   And so it's really a much more immersive experience. I mean it's immersive except that you know the doorbell rings you can answer the door
[00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:49.560]   Nobody's kicking my chair. Yeah, nobody's kicking your chair
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:56.360]   Information martin piers writing and the information made a really interesting point
[00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:02.040]   You you couldn't blame netflix management if they grumbled a little privately after sunday night
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:09.400]   They lost the best picture competition to a dillaton an amateur a company for whom streaming is primarily a brand marketing
[00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:11.000]   exercise
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:15.960]   While netflix has to make a dizzying amount of programming to capture every subscriber who draws a breath
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:19.560]   Apple just needs programming that enhances its brand
[00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:26.040]   The ability to be discriminated and gives apple an enormous advantage its pitch to filmmakers can be simple
[00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:32.360]   This is this underlying this one come to us your shows will stand up go to netflix martin score sazy
[00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:35.320]   And they'll get lost in a more massive stuff
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:43.880]   Yeah, but the the problem there is that apple is still sticking to a sort of eat your vegetables sort of content strategy
[00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:49.560]   I agree. So but you've you'd love to get score sazy, but what apples let's see. Yes, absolutely
[00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:54.440]   Make the Irishman here make a make a story about a hitman who kills people indiscriminately
[00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:57.720]   Do all the do all the custom you want so there's
[00:45:57.720 --> 00:46:01.320]   Cussing very complicated. No if you watch the morning show
[00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:07.000]   Which they dropped the father Jason mimoa thing was one of those violent tv shows i've ever seen
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.120]   Yeah, but there but I but don't you feel like it is a little bit like sunday school?
[00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:12.920]   I kind of agree with you anti. There's a certain I think disney plus it maybe
[00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:15.720]   That quick yeah, yeah
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:23.320]   But I keep maybe it's because I again I finally got caught up on actually I don't know why i'm getting caught up on my streaming
[00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:27.880]   Last weekend, but I was also I also finally got caught up on season two of teddil lasso
[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:30.280]   And a lot of it was really
[00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:38.520]   That that character was gonna do that in that situation no no matter what the stakes are he's gonna do this really really nice thing
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:45.640]   Is that is a little it's gonna happen little sugary now severance is not by the way severance is interesting because it's in
[00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:48.360]   It's an anti work
[00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:51.640]   Basically, it's an anti work show. It's very interesting
[00:46:52.280 --> 00:46:57.160]   Almost perfect for apicalture. Yeah, it's almost about fascism and it's very interesting
[00:46:57.160 --> 00:47:04.440]   It's also a little sterile, but they let but I think they let ben stiller be ben stiller
[00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:07.800]   and so it
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:13.720]   Warning ben stiller is being ben stiller in this movie. It's kind of it's actually it feels subversive
[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:19.960]   So maybe apple unders maybe apple didn't understand that they were getting that brand a little bit and say let's be a little bit more subversive
[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:23.160]   They did announce today that they have the first 12 weeks
[00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:30.680]   Of the friday night baseball double header schedule. This is going to start april 8th with opening day
[00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:35.320]   Apple did announce at the last event that they were gonna have two games every friday night
[00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:38.360]   Um
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:43.240]   I'm not gonna read all the games, but you could if you want apple put out a press release
[00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:47.640]   I'm interested to see if they distinguish themselves that much from mlb
[00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:52.200]   What I will say is that as in live streaming app the mlb app is one of the best
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:55.400]   You know, like it's just what really really well structured in production
[00:47:55.400 --> 00:48:01.800]   And how they do it the the actual user experience of of of like but not just that streaming to you
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:05.560]   That's that's that can be done by any I mean not anybody but it can be done at scale
[00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:09.240]   The the issue is that that the interface is really nice
[00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:11.880]   Like if you you can get it in different modes where you can see all the stats
[00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:15.400]   You can you know do picture in picture between two different games
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:18.200]   You do a lot of really cool things inside of the mlb
[00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:23.160]   App in the both on the app apple tv as well as the ios
[00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:27.960]   And so, you know, i'll be interested to see how apple makes it better than watching the game
[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:34.440]   And on the mlb says and maybe they don't need to maybe just but it is an opportunity since they are a technology company
[00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:37.320]   Yeah, just like amazon does a little bit
[00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:41.000]   They're gonna have thursday night football to kind of say
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.560]   Amazon's been pushing this and it's kind of dumb
[00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:48.680]   But you know the enancers are saying well, let's go to the a ws stats analysis and they
[00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:55.400]   He only had 32 percent chance of catching that like who the hell cares under pi
[00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:59.720]   But a good
[00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:03.720]   But a ws is a good example of the fact that they haven't really innovated that much
[00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:09.480]   No, they you know in in their own app so they've they've they've they've proven that they know how to stream a football game
[00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:13.880]   But we haven't seen them really take that experience anywhere, you know from from there
[00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:18.840]   And so i think that's a big opportunity. Yeah, that's a big opportunity. I'd love to see them say
[00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:22.600]   You know so so some tech chops and say hey, you know, look what we can do
[00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:29.640]   The problem really is is that there's there is uh, you're still the kaboos like the mlb is still doing a game
[00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:32.920]   It's for broadcast and we're gonna give you a we're gonna give you a feed
[00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:36.920]   And if you're lucky, maybe some of the cameras are higher resolution or something like this
[00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:42.760]   But but the boy k would be nice, but i don't know if i think the amazon ones are streaming 4k. Are they i think of the
[00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:45.960]   Yeah, but what else would you do would you do a second screen?
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:49.960]   Experience. Yeah, I mean, I think well, I so I think that there's a um
[00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:52.760]   There's a lot of opportunity to
[00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:55.560]   You know once you start screaming and you're not doing linear
[00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:58.600]   There's all kinds of possibilities of for instance having the
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:03.080]   The side which team and you're gonna have announcers that are not trying to be unbiased
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:05.960]   Like they're like we used to watch the stealer football game
[00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:09.720]   We used to watch the Steelers and we used to listen to miron coke
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:13.480]   Which was the the local broadcaster that had been there for 30 years or whatever
[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:20.120]   But we would listen to it on the radio and even if it was he was off by like three seconds or four seconds between the the radio and the football and so
[00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:23.320]   And you never knew which one it was gonna be either ahead or behind
[00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:28.600]   and um, but we listened to it because we didn't want to listen to the networks talk about steelers
[00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:30.600]   We wanted to listen to iron coke talk about the Steelers
[00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:36.040]   And so um and so I think that you could that's easy to do and it's hard to do in linear
[00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:39.080]   Really easy to do when you're streaming. I think that you could also have
[00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:40.600]   other
[00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:47.640]   Audio tracks for instance, you could have the beginners version where where you um people could put in questions like why are they doing that?
[00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:50.920]   Like why are they and and you can just listen to it and be something you be maybe an ex
[00:50:50.920 --> 00:50:54.120]   Couple ex pros explaining why the quarterback does what it does
[00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:58.600]   You can do all these other things that become very interactive and have entirely different interfaces
[00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:03.000]   You have the same game, but you can take that audience and break it into 10 or you know
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:06.040]   10 or 15 different audiences that are interested in different parts of the game
[00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:09.960]   Yeah, wouldn't that be wouldn't it be brilliant if you could turn it to sort of like a
[00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:18.760]   Gaming streaming where you can you can you can watch like the latest version of of nba 2k 2k 2 2 whatever
[00:51:18.760 --> 00:51:22.120]   But it depends on but you can watch whatever comment
[00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:26.200]   Want talk about like the action in this game imagine if you imagine if
[00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:30.600]   If baseball did this or any sport do the same thing where yes
[00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:33.800]   You subscribe to this main channel that gives you the feed however
[00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:37.640]   There could be user-generated content where I will create a life
[00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:40.600]   I will do my own like commentary stream live with it
[00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:44.040]   So you can basically choose between a professional
[00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:48.760]   You can choose between like the johnnie most type of person who's been doing this professionally
[00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:53.640]   Just got fired from local station because of the network or just some idiot
[00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:58.600]   Who who like you it doesn't doesn't give you insight into the into the proceedings
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:01.160]   But at least like makes it more entertaining to watch
[00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:07.320]   Well, I I started we did a stream where I streamed about 25 basketball games and the thing to understand is I don't know anything about basketball
[00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:10.360]   I don't know. I don't understand at all. I was a I was a wrestler
[00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:11.800]   So I didn't understand anything about basketball
[00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:15.000]   It's just like I don't understand why these people are doing what they're doing and it's moved so fast
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:18.520]   And um, why can't we take a break and huddle and you know like that kind of thing and so
[00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:21.560]   Um, so we streamed all these things and we had an ex-professional
[00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:23.080]   Basketball player
[00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:26.200]   And we had a social media guy that really likes basketball and well known for it
[00:52:26.200 --> 00:52:31.080]   And the two of them sat there and talked and sometimes had an extra guest watching the game and we're streaming it with some of the
[00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:36.040]   Cameras and the the interesting thing was is that by the end of that I completely understood basketball
[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:41.800]   And it's much more interesting to watch now because I understand all the defenses and all the things because they were but they were able to talk in a way
[00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:46.360]   You know, they're answering people's questions people are putting quite questions into the stream like why are they doing this?
[00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:50.920]   And they said explain they'd explain a screenplay and they'd explain the you know
[00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:55.800]   This these are the sets of rules that you have to follow and they're and they just didn't and they didn't have to this was
[00:52:55.800 --> 00:53:00.360]   They were one-sided. So they didn't have to protect anybody. They would say oh that you know
[00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:03.080]   This this team is doing really well or our team should have done better here
[00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:07.000]   And and they were just able to say a lot of things you wouldn't see on broadcasting was so much more interesting
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:11.080]   And I kind of ruined watching most of these games because I was like oh we
[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:16.680]   We were doing this little low budget thing that was way more pleasurable to watch than than the big budget
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:23.480]   That's why you the you pay a lot of money for a good play-by-play and color guy because if they're good
[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:26.200]   They can do that they do do that they bring those games to life
[00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:30.040]   Yeah, so there's but there's like three. It's like there's like three of them
[00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:35.000]   There's some really bad ones and there's hard. Yeah, there's there's only a handful really good one drops off pretty fast
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   I think also there is
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:41.400]   This is always a challenge is chalen's fruit any kind of specialized programming
[00:53:41.400 --> 00:53:46.280]   There's a group in the audience that knows all that stuff and they want to hear a different level of commentary
[00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:49.640]   And that's why that's why you could just write for you as a neophyte
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:55.480]   Because but but you probably wouldn't hear that on network broadcast because they're playing to an audience that's a
[00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:59.480]   hardcore enthusiast audience, right? We're not even they weren't even calling the game ours
[00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:01.640]   What they were not they're not calling the game. I'm just talking about the game
[00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:03.800]   It's like you sitting around with two really smart friends
[00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:05.320]   They don't know a lot about it
[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:09.320]   And the the thing is is that but that's where I think that you know live stream
[00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:15.320]   In a linear going out the tv with all the limitations of unlike lowest common denominator of every person's tv and everything else
[00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:17.480]   It's really hard. I mean Dolby has though
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:20.760]   You know, there are there are technologies that let you stack multiple commentaries
[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:24.600]   But no one knows how to use them in a stream with an interface that you can design
[00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:28.760]   You can very easily say there's a beginner stream. There's a there's the pro stream
[00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:32.200]   There's the there's all these things and these are just audio. They're all looking at the same game
[00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:33.800]   They don't even have to be there
[00:54:33.800 --> 00:54:40.040]   I mean you can give them a low latency connection that they're watching the game through zoom or through the switch or through a variety of different
[00:54:40.040 --> 00:54:43.320]   Technologies and they're all just pumping their commentary into it
[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:46.200]   It's all embedded into up to 16 channels really easily
[00:54:46.200 --> 00:54:53.160]   And then it's just sent out in the hls packet of here's here's 16 different channels that you can choose from and that's that's
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:58.360]   You're saying yes, like this that what we've done with all kinds of ideas the niche slices
[00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:05.800]   Right the cost of that is yeah is a fraction like because it's it's literally paying for commentators and you know the the pipeline
[00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:08.200]   But compared to a whole game, they're cheap these guys
[00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:12.840]   But
[00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:16.520]   It's not another 20
[00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:19.320]   Cameras and three broadcast trucks and yeah, yeah, yeah and an EVS
[00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:22.120]   You know, this is our 20 evs or whatever it is or 18 of them
[00:55:22.120 --> 00:55:29.800]   I think a lot of the problem is the rights issue with the NBA or the MLB or NFL where they would have to approve it and you know
[00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:36.840]   Yeah, you know that's the whole but I but I think that that's where we start seeing some interesting innovation as opposed to just putting it on
[00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:39.560]   Online some league is gonna do it. I think at some point
[00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:43.240]   We and again you get into it by saying i'm gonna buy out the friday ones
[00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:46.680]   And then that's much more where you start to get people willing to experiment and
[00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:50.360]   Everything is doable with enough money and apple has a lot of it right
[00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:55.960]   And it shows off their bigger business, which really is the plus of the point of apple tv plus anyway
[00:55:55.960 --> 00:56:00.040]   Uh, it's not it doesn't need to succeed on its own like Netflix says so
[00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:06.920]   I do think they're getting a little darker. So here is as an example already a couple of shows from apple tv plus today still water
[00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:14.520]   Carl adi and michael have a very special next door neighbor a wise panda named still water or
[00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:20.360]   Pretzel and the puppies meet pretzel the world's longest dachshund
[00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:22.680]   or
[00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:24.680]   But then but then
[00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:28.680]   Some of the new stuff get ready for instance. This a show based on a british
[00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:31.960]   um, a spy series called slu house
[00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:34.040]   Uh
[00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:37.160]   Slow horses. It's a spicers gary oldman
[00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:39.640]   Will star in that
[00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:44.760]   I'm excited about that comes out in april because americans don't know the word slu is that why they change is it slu or slough?
[00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:49.160]   I don't know how they might they probably say slough house. I think they say britain say slough
[00:56:49.160 --> 00:56:52.040]   We say slu house
[00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:55.240]   Unless you're sloughing it off and then we pronounce it slough
[00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:59.400]   Or sounding like a english is a nightmare language
[00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:05.240]   Um, they probably say slough house. I'm thinking that what you'd explain the title slow horses, right?
[00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:11.000]   uh, it's about a um a bunch of uh, mi5 spies who screw up in their career
[00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:17.240]   And are sent to slough house to while away their days doing unimportant work. They're the slow horses
[00:57:17.240 --> 00:57:20.120]   And uh gary oldman's one of them
[00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:22.280]   Gotham, what did he do wrong? Come on
[00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:26.600]   Uh, the roar and anthology of darkly comic
[00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:29.880]   feminist fables. Mm. We'll see
[00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:35.560]   uh for parts uh magic johnson go ahead alex sorry the one thing i was going to say is that that
[00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:38.440]   We talked about the fact that large
[00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:43.400]   Established directors are upset that their movies won't be seen in theaters
[00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:47.240]   But I will say as a starting create as a creator. This has never been
[00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:50.280]   Never been a better time. I mean you can agree
[00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:57.000]   A properly structured pitch has a really good chance of getting any doubt on one of these now because there's such competition
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:01.320]   Yeah, yeah, there's such a there's such an enormous amount of competition right now. Um for for content
[00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:03.320]   So if you have a red
[00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:07.560]   Not even original idea an idea that they think they can make um, I think that you have a pretty good chance if you
[00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:11.480]   You know, it's just never been better for creators to to get this apple paid a lot of money to
[00:58:11.480 --> 00:58:14.760]   Martin score says a for his book
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:18.440]   Starring a Leonardo DiCaprio and robert deniro
[00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:21.080]   killers of the flower moon
[00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:25.560]   The o sage murders and the birth of the fbi that's a movie from the 20s. That sounds
[00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:28.680]   That's prestige right and you got score saysy
[00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:32.680]   Well, and then you know that apple like the thing is what these directors have hated forever
[00:58:32.680 --> 00:58:37.480]   Is dealing with hollywood producers who are constantly telling them how much they can and can't spend
[00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:43.080]   Martin source course azy doing this film. I'm sure that apple was pretty much like, uh, whatever you you know, whatever you need
[00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:46.440]   Yeah, like like he's like I think we need another another $2 million
[00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:52.280]   I'm sure this one was like, I don't know if they paid him to make this or they bought rights for streaming
[00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:55.720]   I think that this is paramount and it's going to be in the theaters
[00:58:55.720 --> 00:59:01.800]   So they probably I spent I'm sure a lot of money. Remember they bought to finch that tom hanks vehicle
[00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:06.440]   That was very expensive. And I don't think made them a lot of money. I don't think it was a huge hit
[00:59:07.240 --> 00:59:09.240]   They do have a deal for a russian
[00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:11.320]   language
[00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:16.600]   Series that was from russian tv that was supposed to start this spring. I have to think oh
[00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:19.160]   That may not happen
[00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:22.440]   Awkward awkward
[00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:24.760]   Um
[00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:29.080]   Here's a maybe more traditional apple story an animated film about sam greenfield
[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:33.480]   The unluckiest person in the world suddenly finding herself in the never before seen
[00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:38.680]   Land of luck where she must unite with magical creatures to turn her luck around
[00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:42.680]   Oh, but they've got a documentary about the history of uh
[00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:46.040]   James bond the sound of double o seven
[00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:54.440]   And and i've been seeing clips of this musical adaptation of christmas carol with will ferrell and ryan renalds
[00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:56.280]   Spirited
[00:59:56.280 --> 01:00:02.200]   I do think that the behind the scenes opportunities for a lot of these movies are really not being taken advantage of by any of the
[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:03.080]   platforms
[01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:05.800]   If you're really into the movie or even if you're just into movie making
[01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:11.480]   It's not that expensive to have in the grand scheme of things to generate another 30 hours of content about that
[01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:15.880]   About that thing and because it's streaming you're not you're not like you have to figure out where to program it
[01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:21.400]   You just put it up there with it and you know and even like disney's done a little bit of this with mandelorian and some of the other ones
[01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:23.480]   And it's been pretty
[01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:26.360]   It's boring. It's why i buy
[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:28.920]   Movies from itunes
[01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:34.280]   There's otherwise no reason to buy a movie, but i want the extras and you know i miss dvd extras
[01:00:34.280 --> 01:00:36.680]   This is the closest thing sometimes they actually have commentaries
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:41.320]   Yeah, not always i wish they i wish you could see what the extras were before you spent
[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:43.800]   They do the apple shows are
[01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:50.280]   Can i find out if they have a and like a director's commentary it has a list you can't like watch the pre no but yeah, that would be good
[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:51.640]   Okay
[01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:57.640]   I just bought dune it was only 10 bucks. It was only 10 bucks, but i figured dune. They've got to be some extras there
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:02.360]   I'm surprised someone hasn't bought up like this is where you someone just buy crit criterion
[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:09.080]   And they're like the criterion extras were the best, you know like if you look at like the criterion release of like armageddon or uh traffic
[01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:12.680]   I love this. I actually subscribed to the criterion channel
[01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:15.240]   Yeah, just for that
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:20.520]   One of the things that's super fun is ryan rennelt and will farrell were both supposed to be on late night talk shows at the same time
[01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:22.840]   And they swapped without telling anybody
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:27.240]   Showed up for each other's law saying the other one had just blown it off because they weren't interested
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:33.000]   And the hosts were like tried to roll with it, but they insisted on answering like they didn't let them change the questions
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.480]   So they made them go through the questions
[01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:40.680]   That's the kind of stuff i want to see more of because it increases interest but also like yeah
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:45.400]   It breaks the fourth wall a little bit dark comedy 10 episode series about the garvey sisters
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:48.120]   Bound together by the premature death of their parents
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:51.400]   That could be that could be dark and then there's the
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:57.000]   The comedy drama about the story behind the beanie babies which stars Elizabeth banks and zach
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:03.480]   The dark and sarah snook is in that from succession. So i probably would be watching the beanie bubble
[01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:08.120]   Um this one it'll be interesting the greatest beer run ever
[01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:13.000]   Starring zach ephron and russell crow is that the old apple two game? Oh?
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:20.360]   It's chuk. It's chicky donahoe who in 1968 left new york to track down and share a few beers with his childhood buddies
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:22.760]   Now in the army fighting in vietnam
[01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:25.960]   Wow, i read the art
[01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:29.480]   It was based on that was a great story. That sounds really interesting as a movie
[01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:35.640]   Yeah, sorry go ahead a little tangent leo did you see that ryan retles did a one password commercial because there's answering his soccer team now
[01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:43.480]   Yeah, oh rennel's youtube channel. He has what is actually a hilarious 30 second one password his ads for mim mobile his company are fantastic
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:47.400]   We were asking what they would do with all that vc money. It turns out they gave it to rennel's
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:50.600]   The rich just get richer
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:53.480]   Uh, it is i suppose i could play this
[01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:55.960]   um
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:02:58.360]   So which one there's a couple there's a few of them
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:02.520]   Uh the one that says cyber security and skincare yes
[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:07.000]   Okay cyber security and skincare
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:12.360]   I need to watch out for our player let's start over here as the owner of rex and football club
[01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:15.000]   I need to watch out for our players
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.160]   I've been a star for a long time these guys have no idea what's coming
[01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:28.120]   Look, we got a big match coming up. This is very much tib lasso
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:31.080]   Yeah, cyber security
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:33.800]   How many of you have heard of one password?
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:38.520]   Really
[01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:41.560]   Okay, well, how many of you have downloaded one password?
[01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:44.680]   They're all raising their hands the idea whales was still cutting edge
[01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:47.560]   So I guess you know that uh
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:50.600]   One password completely secures your digital life
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:57.160]   I will shove a red card so far up your ass people will think it's your tongue
[01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:00.200]   now
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:02.840]   Let's talk night times skincare routines
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:08.040]   That's totally dead lasso takeoff, isn't it?
[01:04:08.040 --> 01:04:11.560]   That's pretty funny. He's not nice. Except he's not nice
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:13.320]   well
[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:17.080]   And he's Canadian why was he so angry at that guy with a red card thing?
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:21.240]   I don't understand that part, but I think he had planned to say that and he just had no word of
[01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:25.880]   Yo, that's right. He had the line. He had to use it. Yeah, he that's probably it. That was
[01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:33.080]   They're they're gonna do a drama series inspired by Fritz Lang's metrop 1927 film metropolis
[01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:38.120]   That sounds these are all uh, these are all new apple tv coming out
[01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:40.920]   I'm still thinking about the fact that I think that rhino ren is just his own channel
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:42.920]   I just he does
[01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:47.880]   He's called Ryan Reynolds. He's just one. He's too good. Yeah, um
[01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:56.200]   A limited series apple describes as an epic thriller set against the world war two nazi occupation of paris
[01:04:56.200 --> 01:05:02.600]   Could be dark julia binos will be in that as kogosh and elle
[01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:06.040]   Getting good casts. They're get there. Well, let's see
[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:11.080]   Yeah, yeah, it's exactly what you were saying that Alex they having the having the prestige
[01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:16.040]   Awards really brings in you start getting those awards and it's no longer, you know, just uh
[01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:20.200]   retail content it becomes like it's it's a thing and because
[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:26.040]   The actors want to feel like they're gonna get a chance to win an oscar or they're gonna get a chance to win an Emmy or or something
[01:05:26.040 --> 01:05:29.480]   They they gotta feel like they're gonna that this is good because that moves that you know
[01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:34.280]   They get to charge a lot more like like an oscar's worth millions. Yeah, you know in every time you
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:40.840]   You know every time you do a film so it's it's a so it's a big deal to win those those awards for the actors
[01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:45.960]   And as a result for the for the platform. I actually think what we're also seeing is that these sony guys
[01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:52.200]   Are pros in you know, it's not any queue and these sony guys say well, we gotta do this
[01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:55.240]   So for instance, there's a food show a food documentary
[01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:57.960]   from karae joji fukanaga
[01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:02.600]   Uh telling the story of humanity through eight defining ingredients. That's kind of classic
[01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:07.560]   I don't know discovery or uh, I don't know who does the food food channel
[01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:10.600]   uh 10 part documentary about the new england patriots
[01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:16.360]   You know that these are these are classics that you see on other streaming big budget bbcpbs
[01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:17.800]   collaborations
[01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:23.880]   Uh presumed im innocent is an eight episode limited series from the scott taro novel of the same name
[01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:28.440]   David e kelly jj abrams executive producers pretty good
[01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:32.760]   I we haven't seen the cast list for that but kristan wig and laura dern are gonna be in a
[01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:35.240]   show called mrs american pie
[01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:40.920]   Uh apple studios is producing this one 10 episode comedy set in the early 70s
[01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:44.600]   And if you agree to the casting eddy q will turn your iphone service back on
[01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:51.800]   So i'm this is a long i could go through go on and on this is a long list
[01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:55.320]   A limited series true crime story about the hunt for john wilks booth
[01:06:56.120 --> 01:06:58.840]   In the aftermath of the lincoln assassination man hunt
[01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:02.200]   This is good. I'm you know apples
[01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:06.600]   You know what it just takes time doesn't it it takes a while to spin up the wheels
[01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:10.360]   There's a george clunney brad pit john wats
[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:13.480]   film untitled project

[01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:38.600]   Um yo gaba gaba. Oh, yeah, we remember that one
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:42.680]   Oh, no, oh no, we had escaped that
[01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:45.160]   It's back, baby
[01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:47.320]   a live action yo gaba gaba
[01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:52.920]   Uh ghosted ana dearmis and chris evans all right
[01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:55.560]   romantic action adventure film
[01:07:55.560 --> 01:08:00.760]   But this is this gets back into when people say this is the i mean when you have access to all these actors
[01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:04.840]   And all these directors. It's it's it's kind of inevitable that you know, you're not
[01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:06.840]   Not going to keep on
[01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:10.520]   You know, you're gonna only have the biggest films on big theater screens. You're not gonna really go
[01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:13.720]   This is a great list. These are movies. I would go see in the theater
[01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:18.520]   Uh bad monkey and carl i which is one of my i love carl hyacinth and one of my favorites novelists
[01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:21.480]   uh, that's a vincevon vehicle
[01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:24.760]   And featuring a monkey there is a monkey
[01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:32.280]   Hyacinth likes having animals in his in his novels a series on the united niegro league baseball
[01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:35.320]   Uh
[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:39.960]   This is yeah, i'm excited this i think apple is is kind of hitting their stride now
[01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:43.640]   Some big name performers directors actors writers
[01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:51.240]   Uh and some and awards and awards. Yeah, so congratulations on the uh oscar for coda, which i still haven't seen
[01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:55.640]   I will say that I think that apple should with all of this content that creating
[01:08:55.640 --> 01:09:02.280]   I still think that they should tell these you know like have the creators do whatever they want to do but say pick one scene
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:05.160]   And we just want that in final cut
[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:09.720]   We just pick one scene and then just just just grab one. We just want to do it
[01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:11.960]   Because you know basically releasing
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:16.680]   You know, basically taking all this content to the creating whether it's documentaries or other things like that
[01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:21.240]   And you know cutting it together even if they literally did it in abbot and then
[01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:28.840]   Then recut it in final cut and then release it as a uh, yeah, you know, just release it at you know for users
[01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:31.000]   It's a it would
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.440]   You know, it's a master's course. I mean when you open up anybody's project files
[01:09:34.440 --> 01:09:38.520]   They've done that with garage band. They've done it with um, they took a billy eyelash song
[01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:43.960]   I mean I gotta tell you the billy eyelash something that comes with logic now that is incredible like it's just
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:46.440]   it's the breakdown of it is
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:51.240]   Is um amazing to just look what they actually put together there. So so I think that
[01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:54.200]   Yeah, like the whole thing is is that they're making all this content
[01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:57.480]   They're not saying you have to do all of the scenes that way or you have to do the whole movie
[01:09:57.480 --> 01:10:03.000]   But you just do one so that people can learn a little bit about it and what it would generate almost immediately is
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:07.000]   More content about how to do this like master fun created by the way
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.800]   Well done sammy love jaxon
[01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:13.960]   Sneaking in his mention of masterclass during the us Oscars
[01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:17.800]   It's a tribute to pulp fiction. So urna Thurman jaxon
[01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:22.360]   uh, john dravolta come out they're talking about it and uh
[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:27.240]   Samuel jaxon talking about acting and dravolta says you should do you should teach a class on that
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:29.240]   He said I did on masterclass. It's like oh
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:32.840]   That's the class going yeah
[01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:34.840]   Yeah
[01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:41.800]   Everyone everyone's gonna go see it and of course he makes money on the number of but that's an example what you're talking about
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:46.920]   I mean that's a behind the scenes how they make it. I would love to see more of that stuff and apple could absolutely do that
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:51.400]   Be amazing and they have the films. I mean the big thing is the expensive thing is to build
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:55.560]   I mean like I don't think people understand like how expensive masterclass is they shoot masterclass is a
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:11:00.600]   Huge in the stage near me and um it's very near me and uh
[01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:05.640]   They uh, they it's you know, it's 60 the crew is like 60. Oh, yeah
[01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:10.440]   It's not like you know, they're building they're building the sets from scratch, you know in a raw stage
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:14.280]   I mean these are not wait a minute messing around wait a minute those aren't shot on location
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:18.360]   These are actually all on a sound stage. It's all yeah. Oh, man
[01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:25.240]   I don't know they're all that way, but but definitely there's I wouldn't be surprised because the quality the lighting and the everything's so perfect
[01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:29.480]   That yeah makes sense. You're not gonna. It's yeah, you're not gonna take over steve martin's apartment
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:33.160]   Yeah
[01:11:33.160 --> 01:11:40.360]   I don't know for sure. I don't know for sure if that's where they all are but but definitely some of them makes a lot of sense to be honest
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:42.520]   They're too perfect. Yeah
[01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:44.440]   Um
[01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:47.640]   There is one other thing that we didn't mention which is product placement
[01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:54.360]   Everyone he shows his rife with iPhones and iPads and macbook. Yeah, but only the good people
[01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:59.640]   Uh, yeah, no bad guys. Do they give them windows machines? I didn't see koto. Is there a bunch there?
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:01.880]   No, see they shot that before the apple involvement
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:07.800]   It's only the stuff like ted lasso that apple actually produces that has all that stuff lassus got a lot of iPhones in it
[01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:09.640]   Disney's got a ton of android
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:11.160]   do they
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:17.640]   It really annoys me billions which is a show about uh, you know billionaire hedge fund managers and their shenanigans
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:23.480]   Uh is all windows surface like they even have a surface studio which out microsoft has his olden years
[01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:26.680]   It's all surfaces everywhere
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:32.040]   Moments on tv is when microsoft think this huge deal was cbs and before that all these shows were using ipads
[01:12:32.040 --> 01:12:35.160]   Just because they were easy to get and like they get out the car and type on their ipad
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:38.280]   But as soon as the deal was in literally in like all these cop shows
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:42.200]   They would pull the car over get out take out the surface put it down
[01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:44.280]   Unflip the stand pull it in
[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:49.480]   Mounted like show off the animations and the villain would be running halfway down the street by then it was amazing
[01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:56.760]   No, my favorite things about the old show parks and recreation was that they had a deal with microsoft and that was the only place
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:58.680]   anywhere in
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:03.480]   Probably in reality not just not just media that you'd find people using actual windows phones
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:08.200]   Because all of them were using windows phones and and surface tablets and it's like
[01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:14.280]   Okay, maybe that's maybe that's how weird this this town actually is that they're they're the one mutant
[01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:21.320]   Demographic that actually sees the appeal of a windows phone now. I don't think the computers featured in severance
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:24.120]   our actual apple products
[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:31.160]   Maybe they're tarry one could be future apple products the other green screen actually they're real working computers
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:38.840]   um Ben stiller told e news that the prop master sourced old computers and had them rebuilt so that they'd work
[01:13:38.840 --> 01:13:43.240]   So and they're running actual software so that the actors don't have to kind of pretend
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:45.960]   Yeah
[01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:49.880]   Think about that cbs deal those that they would always it was for ford and for wind for microsoft
[01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:56.120]   And they would always pause and teach you how the car or the windows phone worked in the middle of high speed chases or criminal investigations
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:14:01.400]   They would give you a lecture about how tiles or how cruise control work. It was amazing. It's a great
[01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:05.080]   Quick go to Bing maps and let us know if there's a restaurant
[01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:08.040]   There yeah, exactly that
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:10.680]   Yeah, exactly. Yeah
[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:13.640]   Uh, all right. Let's take a little break more to come
[01:14:13.640 --> 01:14:18.280]   Renee richy youtube.com/Renee richy. What are you working on these days?
[01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:26.280]   Oh, I just finished all my max studio and studio display coverage and now i'm starting to warm up for wdc in case i can't
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.920]   Imminently it could be at a moment keep your eye peeled on your inbox
[01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:36.040]   Um, yes an apple dot cam. Yeah, andy and ako hot spotting today
[01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:43.880]   Not from the library. It's going fine though. It's working. Well. Yeah, it's fine. Thank you. Thank you atnt 5g network service. It is
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:50.280]   Long as my battery hands out here. Are you getting their ultra wideband or just regular 5g? What are you getting?
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:52.840]   I'm afraid to touch my phone right now
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:15:01.000]   Don't don't I did I did do I did do a speed test and I'm getting like an impressive like 40 up
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:07.240]   It's getting 40 down and like eight or nine or 10 up. I haven't paid for any special services
[01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:13.400]   That's that's that's that's an improvement upon. I won't tell I don't know what the problem with my my home internet
[01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:18.120]   It is now, but I did a speed test when I noticed it was going walking and it was somewhere around
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:21.400]   1.2
[01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:23.400]   Down
[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:25.640]   That was yeah
[01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:28.840]   I'm sorry. I will I will look into this. I will make alternative arrangements
[01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:35.080]   It is interesting though that in many cases now if you're lucky enough to be near a 5g tower and more and more of us are
[01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:39.800]   Especially the mid mid band the ultra wideband or ultra capacity as t-mobile calls it
[01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:46.680]   Yeah, it's better than home internet for most people. It's hundreds of megabits down and 30 or 40. It's incredible. Yeah
[01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:52.200]   It's I mean, this is why I keep I keep advising people writing people that once every year
[01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:59.160]   You have to go to your broadband provider and find out like what brought what great plans are now a little because it's possible you're paying
[01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:03.880]   Uh, $40 a month. Yeah for essentially what is now cell phone
[01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:07.800]   Hot spot speed and by paying the exact same amount of money
[01:16:07.800 --> 01:16:10.600]   They will switch you to a higher service. It gives you three or four or five times
[01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:17.160]   It is that the the idea of having and the the idea of being able to connect to Dropbox faster than you can
[01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:22.360]   To like a home server is oh my goodness. What a wonderful world we live in

[01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:57.640]   There's a class action lawsuit. They may be sending you a check
[01:20:58.360 --> 01:21:05.400]   Apple has agreed to pay 14.8 million dollars to paid tier subscribers to iCloud
[01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:09.960]   for quote breach of contract regarding regarding the iCloud service
[01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:13.000]   Apparently, I don't does
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:20.520]   I wasn't upset but apparently apple breached the iCloud terms and conditions by storing iCloud user data using third party servers
[01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:24.600]   Rather than their own. Well, they don't have first party servers. Yeah, that's all
[01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:26.040]   Yeah
[01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:31.320]   It was all amazon it was all asia and amazon and gril right fine. What did you think?
[01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:33.720]   What did you care?
[01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:39.800]   Anyway, september 16 through 2015 through january 31st 2016 if you had a subscription to iCloud
[01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:42.040]   You're in the class. You don't need to do anything
[01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:48.600]   Uh, make sure that the email you sign up for iCloud during that time is still active you will get notification
[01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:55.720]   And a check probably for buck 50. I don't i get so many of those i think it's actually because kebeka's so litigious
[01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:58.520]   I get like 18 cent emails all the time. I
[01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:02.360]   It's such a racket by the lawyers like this whole thing is a racket
[01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:06.120]   We all get big dollars each and they get they get 40 percent, you know, so
[01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:13.240]   So that's how this all works. So so it's it's uh, it's just a racket keep an eye on your email if you were using iCloud
[01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:18.680]   That's pretty early. I got it i'm gonna get two dollars and 83 cents. I mean, I I can almost buy a cappuccino with that
[01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:23.400]   Uh, you will get more the more you subscribe to
[01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:27.640]   Apple should have mentioned that in the in the ad
[01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:34.120]   In the ads they should have said hey get the higher tier because when we do settle a lawsuit in 20 years
[01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:36.760]   You're gonna get more money
[01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:39.560]   Yandex
[01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:41.560]   Yandex the russian google
[01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:47.560]   Is apparently harvesting data from millions of ios apps ios apps and sending them to russia
[01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:50.280]   Whether or not use the company's apps
[01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:55.480]   Your data this is from nine to five mac financial times article
[01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:59.720]   a security researcher discovered the code which sends data to russia
[01:22:59.720 --> 01:23:02.600]   and uh
[01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:08.760]   FT says it's independently verified the claims russia's biggest internet company has embedded cone in the apps found on mobile devices
[01:23:08.760 --> 01:23:11.160]   zack edwards
[01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:17.080]   First made the discovery as part of an app auditing campaign for the me to be alliance a non-profit
[01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:21.320]   FT had four independent experts. They ran tests same thing
[01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:25.720]   Uh, I wish there were a list here among the apps
[01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:29.240]   So this was a service called app metrica
[01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:32.200]   So that you know, that's an easy
[01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:35.640]   Sell to some app developers. Hey, you want to know how your users are using it
[01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:39.080]   You've seen the checkbox send information back to the developer
[01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:45.480]   Among the apps with app metric metrica installed are games messaging apps location sharing tools
[01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:47.880]   hundreds of virtual private networks
[01:23:48.440 --> 01:23:54.200]   Seven VPNs are made specifically for a Ukrainian audience that may be really why they want this right
[01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:56.040]   uh
[01:23:56.040 --> 01:24:00.360]   Hundreds of millions of installs of the app metric sdk according to app figures
[01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:07.000]   So I don't I don't I don't know what to say about that. Yeah, it's just hard to know
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:12.120]   It's it's it's a lot it's a lot like when you hear reports, but this is sending you information back to china this
[01:24:12.760 --> 01:24:16.840]   Right, I mean that information back to you. Yeah, but there are private corporations in china
[01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:21.240]   Just like there are private corporations in the united states that like to monetize all those kinds of data
[01:24:21.240 --> 01:24:23.560]   obviously the fact that
[01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:28.680]   Uh, what's going on in russia and the fact that there are laws that say that hey if you've got date if you've collected data
[01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:33.400]   We the government have a right to get to get at that data as well makes things a little bit scary
[01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:37.880]   But this in and of itself isn't a big problem if anything it just highlights the fact that
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:42.840]   So there's so much embedded in all the apps and all the services that we do
[01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:47.720]   We use that it's impossible to know where our data is going and who would speak exploited by
[01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:50.840]   Well, we finally reached 50 million euros
[01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:54.920]   Apples paid his last payment
[01:24:54.920 --> 01:25:02.360]   To the netherlands regulators for as tim cook tim cook flicks the dollars off of the outside of the world
[01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:05.400]   Your kid
[01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:07.400]   No more of this. Yes
[01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:09.480]   Yeah, that's the whole tugged up your budget
[01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:12.280]   steak steak classy apple
[01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:15.960]   The authority for consumers in markets the Dutch regulator
[01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:18.760]   uh
[01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:24.680]   Has a new proposal from apple which they say should result in definitive conditions for dating app providers
[01:25:24.680 --> 01:25:27.240]   Something that we all care about
[01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:31.000]   Dating apps every time every time it comes up i'm just like really but
[01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:36.520]   ACM says apple could face further penalties if they the revised offer is
[01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:39.880]   Ultimately deemed unacceptable
[01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:43.000]   Uh the ACM says
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:47.640]   And I don't know how to do a Dutch accent. So don't worry. You're safe ACM welcomes apple's current step
[01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:53.320]   The adjusted proposal should result in definitive conditions for dating app providers that wish to use the app store
[01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:56.680]   Thank you for not just doing gold member. We all appreciate it
[01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:04.360]   So uh apple has paid the maximum penalty of 10 payments of five million euros each
[01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:10.120]   I hope they got a toaster or something. Are they gonna just let me give the price of iPhones in in the netherlands to competency
[01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:13.160]   Really i think they should have sent the senate in pennies
[01:26:13.160 --> 01:26:16.680]   Now i did tractor trailer. Here's five million dollars in pennies
[01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:22.280]   I didn't bring this rumor up as a lead story. Although some might say oh you missed the lead
[01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:28.520]   Mark german's power on newsletter said apple is working on a hardware subscription service
[01:26:28.920 --> 01:26:33.160]   For iPhones the only reason I don't know what this story means is they already kind of offer
[01:26:33.160 --> 01:26:37.240]   Yeah, a payment plan that you get the new iphone every leasing pen
[01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:41.480]   This is a rental plan like right now you can lease your iphone now that you'll be able to rent it as well
[01:26:41.480 --> 01:26:43.960]   What is that what's huh
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:48.280]   How is that different i'll pay him a monthly fee and I get a phone, but you don't get to own it at the end
[01:26:48.280 --> 01:26:49.960]   Oh
[01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:51.960]   Well in either case, right
[01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:57.400]   It means you pay a subscription and then what what is this rent to own no it's just rent to realm
[01:26:57.720 --> 01:27:01.080]   Okay, you just swap it out every every year you get a new one that's the same
[01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:05.960]   It is if you don't but you can lease it and then at the end pay it off
[01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:12.040]   Oh, you know, but this one isn't you're never gonna have there's no there's no payoff at the end. That's the only difference
[01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:19.160]   Yeah, well, but it's a big it's a big difference for uh, i'm sorry about this i get a latency is killing us
[01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:21.320]   but uh, it's a big difference from
[01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:25.400]   In terms of how apple explains itself to to shareholders that
[01:27:26.280 --> 01:27:31.720]   If the problem with buying a phone is that a lot of people will think that even if you're paying them in installments that hey
[01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:34.600]   I've got my phone. Hey, it works great. Hey, I have no need to upgrade
[01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:38.840]   Thank you apple. I'm not sending you any more money month after month if you turn into a service
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:46.520]   Essentially, you're essentially you're the relationship is that this is a subscription where every month on the on the first of the month every single month
[01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:51.640]   I'm going to be sending you 48 dollars and that's going to be going on forever without any end in sight
[01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:54.120]   That's a much more much more reliable
[01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:59.000]   Uh way of generating revenue plus at some point they swap out the phone you get the phone back
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:03.080]   You could turn that back into uh, you can turn the hardware into a different channel
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:08.680]   So again, but but mostly it's about making sure there's a steady metronome of every single user
[01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:13.480]   Is always giving me a certain amount of money every single month add nauseum for 10 years in this
[01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:18.680]   We should say that apple has not announced this. This is what the rumor river right plan would be
[01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:23.320]   Well, it's also much simpler to do things like roll in a general rental that is
[01:28:24.040 --> 01:28:25.320]   uh
[01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:31.240]   You know roll a general rental that is includes all of your apple services along with the hardware and there can just be one big
[01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:36.360]   And as Andy said 48 dollars or 46 dollars or 52 dollars or whatever that you're paying a month
[01:28:36.360 --> 01:28:43.160]   And you're getting your apple tv plus you're getting your new you know all everything is all coming in that one rollout in fact
[01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:46.600]   Yeah, that would be interesting. So one flat fee for the whole
[01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:51.800]   Bang. Yeah, you just you just get one one check for for all of that stuff plus whatever
[01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:54.680]   And then I think that I think that with all the europe
[01:28:54.680 --> 01:28:57.320]   EU stuff and depending on how the laws are written
[01:28:57.320 --> 01:29:00.280]   You can see apple putting in you don't have to install it
[01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:05.160]   But you can sign up and get basically a lot more core apps, you know where they just start
[01:29:05.160 --> 01:29:10.840]   Basically doing apple arcade for apps, you know and then and then all of that and then all of that's rolled into one big
[01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:15.560]   So essentially right now it's uh, it's really an amorta amortized
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:17.720]   uh lease
[01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:22.920]   They do it through citizen one they they divide the price of the phone by 12 or 24 months
[01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:25.720]   And that's what you pay per month german says
[01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:33.400]   It would be a yet to be determined monthly fee for this rental program that depends on which device the user chooses
[01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:39.560]   The company has discussed allowing users of the program to swap out their devices for new models when fresh hardware comes out
[01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:42.120]   That's something you do get with the apple upgrade plan, right?
[01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:46.200]   So i'm very i think this is confusing um
[01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:49.960]   And would it be lower monthly cost or higher?
[01:29:49.960 --> 01:29:52.840]   I think it could you if you did lower you would be lower than the lease
[01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:57.480]   Okay, it's all bundled with a whole bunch of things so you're getting a whole the value would be much higher
[01:29:57.480 --> 01:29:59.560]   What happens if you destroy the phone?
[01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:03.240]   You get a nice bill you pay for the phone outright
[01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:08.120]   Fully it's like if you break any rental thing, but it's a very like one thing is that a lot of these are us only
[01:30:08.120 --> 01:30:10.200]   So like you have to constrain yourself to that market
[01:30:10.360 --> 01:30:13.800]   But then the media as soon as apple announced apple won a lot of media
[01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:17.000]   I was like well why why can't you get an iphone with this that makes total sense?
[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.720]   Just bundle in the iphone and it's really an apple one program
[01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:25.400]   And then google either announce or it was leaked that they're announcing i'm fuzzy on the details a similar rental program
[01:30:25.400 --> 01:30:29.880]   And so this is something the market has really wanted apple to do because they want money
[01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:32.600]   Basically more of our money all of it
[01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:36.840]   Well, it's just much more stable would like that somebody wants a lower monthly payment
[01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:43.080]   Is that it would happen and it's the simplicity you'll get all the services for less money
[01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:45.960]   But this but the company has gets way more stable
[01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:51.160]   Much more stable income than trying to make that work because you just know how many phones you need to make you
[01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:56.920]   You know how many things you need to do you have your ability, you know, it's it's it's the subscriptions always better
[01:30:56.920 --> 01:31:03.320]   For the company but you can also if you if you these are all digital products and so you can start lowering those prices
[01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:05.640]   A fair bit
[01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:12.760]   You know, it's it's all a little bit made up and so so you can not all I mean there is some cost but not nearly what what we're getting charged most of the time
[01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:14.920]   and so
[01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:20.520]   So apple can you know bundle all you can keep bundling into this thing where you're and it's a it's a really nice
[01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:27.240]   Business model because the chances of someone leaving in it. It becomes lower and lower. Yeah, that's good for stickiness. Yeah
[01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:30.360]   all right, I I
[01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:32.920]   I don't understand but
[01:31:32.920 --> 01:31:34.920]   You
[01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:37.160]   Don't buy Leo. They don't buy houses. They don't buy cars
[01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:40.760]   They want to rent everything if you could do an apple share program where you would tap it
[01:31:40.760 --> 01:31:42.200]   No, you can't tap because you don't have an iPhone
[01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:45.560]   But you would you'd hit something and the iPhone would show up for the long period of time you needed it
[01:31:45.560 --> 01:31:51.000]   Then it would go to somebody else they do that too apple makes your money if you pay less per month
[01:31:51.000 --> 01:31:52.920]   How?
[01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:54.920]   Because it's because it's
[01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:59.720]   Yeah, well the other thing is is that it's just it's stable income. It means that you're it's an accounting thing
[01:31:59.720 --> 01:32:07.960]   They prefer they prefer it that way they will not they will make the thing is is that more and more people as more and more people buy into it
[01:32:07.960 --> 01:32:11.960]   It the lock-in is intense like it's you know like you're now
[01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:15.880]   I don't think you can't have a lot of it because you just is it are you months to months?
[01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:19.800]   Maybe you're not well your services are tied in and then they resell it all year
[01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:23.000]   Get the new one they resell the other one in third mark in the emerging markets
[01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.240]   Which is gangbustered business for them as well?
[01:32:25.800 --> 01:32:29.880]   And you know and then also it when you get when you make this transitory
[01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:33.320]   This is where all these things in the app store become really that's the friction
[01:32:33.320 --> 01:32:39.880]   Is that now you have to reread register for all those things and re re-sign in and everything else and that'll that'll have a downward
[01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:43.800]   Both it'll be both, you know, and especially if you have a rental where you're just changing them out
[01:32:43.800 --> 01:32:49.240]   Um the the apps that you you'll only you'll only stick with the apps that that are outside the app store
[01:32:49.240 --> 01:32:51.160]   One year
[01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:55.800]   Because as soon as you get to do you have to do the update you'll be like, uh, do I really need cnn plus?
[01:32:55.800 --> 01:33:00.680]   You know, I fix it finally has torn down the mac studio
[01:33:00.680 --> 01:33:06.920]   We saw a mac mac text a max text tear down on youtube, but this is the more kind of formal
[01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:13.960]   Thing and one of the things that max text tear down raise this issue of these additional slots in the mac studio
[01:33:13.960 --> 01:33:18.680]   Logic board that looked like they were for additional storage cards
[01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:23.320]   Um, I fix it did a quote a lot of testing
[01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:32.360]   We popped this stick into another base model mac studios empty slot, but you kept getting dfu restore errors no matter the configuration
[01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:37.400]   We haven't got two base model drives to boot simultaneously in a single machine
[01:33:37.400 --> 01:33:40.360]   There was one thing they could do when we swapped
[01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:47.320]   The spare studios drive for the one in the tear down unit and use configurator to do a dfu restore at work
[01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:52.680]   That's what you were saying or somebody was saying or maybe it was a dock rock that that
[01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:55.480]   signs the
[01:33:55.480 --> 01:33:57.960]   Storage and says now oh, yeah, it's it's mine
[01:33:57.960 --> 01:34:04.200]   Yeah, yeah, it's lots of apples good convenience. Yeah, we were saying that last week. Yeah
[01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:09.800]   Um, you can't have someone be able to take a take a storage drive out of one machine put another and get access to all your data
[01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:14.600]   So that's why that's all right. Well that would be nice if a machine dies you could take the card out
[01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:18.600]   And and save it as you can with a pc, but then the five eyes love that too. Yeah
[01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:22.360]   We just take this right. Thank you. You can keep the car the computer
[01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:28.520]   Storage swaps are possible between two drives of the same size the jury still out on upgrade says I fix it
[01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:31.800]   Perhaps a software update will make the spare slot worthwhile
[01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:37.080]   But right now it's not one thing to point out is that the reason that they're often uh sold soldered welded
[01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:42.280]   Whatever onto the boards in mobile devices is because one of the most common tech support issues apple faced
[01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:47.560]   Was people just unseating them over normal course of business like dropping them or banging them around in their bags who would become unseated?
[01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:48.920]   That would be a tech support incident
[01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:52.760]   So just welding them in was fine and because those products are so much more popular than max
[01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:58.440]   Keeping all those skus around is not a problem. This is a very small batch product for apple is designed for enthusiasts
[01:34:58.440 --> 01:35:02.760]   So this lets them assemble skus on the fly like if you want four terabytes or eight terabytes
[01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:07.480]   They can just pop that in send the model out and not have to make a separate version of the board for every sku
[01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:11.000]   So it's it's for their efficiency not for our configurability
[01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:15.960]   they did do a very clean nice picture of the logic board and the
[01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:19.240]   Chip they didn't get an ultra they only got a max
[01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:22.360]   so um, I what so this
[01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:27.560]   This is different. They took the plastic. I guess off the die right is that what happened there
[01:35:27.560 --> 01:35:31.800]   And so now these are the these are the rams these black squares or
[01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:36.440]   Other or the ale use or whatever they call it and then this is the chip in here the
[01:35:36.440 --> 01:35:39.320]   In this case the max
[01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:41.080]   um
[01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:43.080]   Big old fan
[01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:46.440]   By the way, yeah, they call it a fan or quadcopter
[01:35:46.440 --> 01:35:50.920]   It's a littlier littlier
[01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:56.040]   Dual fan assembly. I have to say I am so impressed with my max studios
[01:35:56.040 --> 01:36:00.280]   Uh, at least as I said lisa has the ultra i have the max fans on all the time
[01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:06.120]   But it's very it's so quiet you don't hear it and never gets hot never gets warm never no thermal problems
[01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:10.840]   They're messing with your mind. They have like a bunch of different fans that are going at different frequencies that are hard for humans to hear when
[01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:13.800]   And it doesn't let them combine up to make a louder frequency either
[01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:19.560]   They don't want to be on that kind of stuff. Yeah, that whole audio lab is fantastic ever since they got that audio lab set up
[01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:24.760]   They do things like they they try to figure out using machine learning where your ear is when you hold the thing up
[01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:26.760]   And they do all sorts of different kind of
[01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:32.680]   uh advanced uh sound design yeah six to ten on the repair ability scale mostly because
[01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:36.200]   It's a system on a chip so you can't upgrade the ram
[01:36:36.200 --> 01:36:37.720]   and uh
[01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:41.800]   And the fans they said are buried and the storage being non-upgradable so
[01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:47.000]   Uh, but that six to ten is actually pretty good. I mean, I didn't expect more than that
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:54.760]   I just I just wish that the fans were easier to clean the fact that they've got so the fact that half of that of that volume is
[01:36:54.760 --> 01:37:00.360]   Just fans and the fact that these fans are on almost all the time shows you how important it is that these things work and work
[01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:02.600]   Just spec and the thing is if you don't
[01:37:03.560 --> 01:37:10.760]   That is regular routine periodic maintenance every three to four months open up the case run a vacuum in there get rid of all the dust
[01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:17.400]   Is and keep it in there so if that becomes a problem. I shouldn't have to go back to the apple store every time every just to show people that
[01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:23.000]   Here's uh, here's what the studio display looks like when you open it up
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:26.120]   Oh, it also has these are two big fans
[01:37:26.120 --> 01:37:32.840]   And you know that because the I just like the studio computer the display is always uh fan is always on and blowing
[01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:35.000]   LED back panel is hot is it yeah
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:41.960]   Uh, they also took a look at uh, wow. This is this is really cool. I mean this it could be this is a computer
[01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:47.800]   It's not just a display. I'm kind of sad. There's no wife like one of my one of my dreams with this product is like the apple did apple
[01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:54.600]   Done something like really unusual air pods have gotten feature upgrades year after year. They got spatial audio. They got conversation boost
[01:37:54.600 --> 01:38:00.280]   They're getting new features at every wwc like their computers because they are and this has an a13 in it
[01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:04.200]   So I was hoping like maybe they'll get stereo pairing for people who have two of them
[01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:08.760]   But if they had if they had wi-fi in this like apple crams wi-fi into everything they could announce
[01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:16.040]   Hey, we're adding built-in airplay and sidecar to the apple studio display so that if you come in and it's set up on your max studio
[01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:19.960]   But you just want to use it for a few seconds with your macbook. You don't have to move any cables
[01:38:19.960 --> 01:38:25.240]   You can just take it over. I think that would be great. So i'm hoping that maybe they'll they'll address that in the future
[01:38:25.240 --> 01:38:28.040]   even even a picture in picture that belongs inside of the
[01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:31.480]   Display that is playing something that you want to watch
[01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:35.960]   But you can keep on working and you're not worried about the two of them kind of interacting with each other
[01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:38.280]   You know, I think that's interesting
[01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:43.800]   Yeah, I think it would be just as interesting if the power cord were removable. Oh my god
[01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:50.360]   I didn't I didn't you know, I never it never needs it is removable, but you need a special tool. Yeah, you need a pull like your Linus
[01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:53.880]   Yeah, it's it's like I
[01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:56.840]   I don't think anybody would ever imagine that this
[01:38:57.640 --> 01:38:59.800]   Anyway, I don't I don't know how to explain it
[01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:06.440]   I wish I hope that they have a really good explanation of why they weren't unable to put in something that makes it a obvious
[01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:08.440]   This thing is removable on its own
[01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:12.120]   And be to make sure that if I if I get a problem with a plug-in of it
[01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:16.040]   I don't again. I don't can make a service call in order to get this fix. It's such a weird
[01:39:16.040 --> 01:39:19.400]   I have that but you may not like it like I have the explanation, but you may not like it
[01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:20.840]   So it's it's a couple of things
[01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:24.840]   It's all design is compromised and everything is a trade-off and this is what they were coming up against
[01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:27.240]   They wanted to make it thin they wanted to make it with apples aesthetic
[01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:31.960]   But you can't do magsafe like you do on the iMac unless you have a power brick
[01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:34.760]   And they didn't want to put a power brick on it so they put a power brick on it
[01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:37.160]   They could do magsafe and then nobody would have a problem with it
[01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:40.600]   Even though magsafe is also proprietary, so it's weird people yell about the cable
[01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:45.080]   But still want magsafe not Andy, but like there were people on the internet yelling that they would rather have magsafe
[01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:47.080]   Even though that's still proprietary
[01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:50.120]   But then it's so shallow like they can't put a normal plug in there
[01:39:50.120 --> 01:39:52.520]   So they designed this very shallow plug in there
[01:39:52.520 --> 01:39:55.800]   But it's incredibly fragile and they figured if it was too easy to remove
[01:39:55.800 --> 01:40:01.000]   There's no intent line if people would just pop it off and on and they would inevitably break it and then require a service in a sentence
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:04.120]   I get that's fine. I get it. It's a space for those plugs
[01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:07.800]   It wasn't just you know, there's a reason for it. That's fine
[01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:10.920]   Is that is fine? You know it's taking the power brick
[01:40:10.920 --> 01:40:11.880]   Well
[01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:14.360]   Yeah, I agree I would take the power brick too
[01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:19.160]   But do they communicate that look don't keep pulling on this you're going to break it?
[01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:20.360]   No, they don't
[01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:22.760]   That there should be a sign on it. You have to watch a line of this theory almost breaks it
[01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:23.960]   Yeah, exactly
[01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:26.120]   I saw it and I'm like, okay
[01:40:26.120 --> 01:40:32.680]   I love the way that that LTT does videos because they really do play the role of the of the user and all of this
[01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:37.320]   They don't just they don't just get a briefing and say oh, well, we were told this no they actually do they
[01:40:37.320 --> 01:40:40.360]   You do you look at this and do you think to yourself?
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:42.120]   This looks like it's supposed to be removable
[01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:48.520]   Maybe I'm just not pulling hard enough or does it communicate either by language or by fitting that no
[01:40:48.520 --> 01:40:53.000]   Don't keep pulling on this you will break it really it wasn't until I saw someone put on Thingiverse
[01:40:53.240 --> 01:40:55.720]   Their own version of that removal tool that I've
[01:40:55.720 --> 01:41:02.520]   Figured up that I feel is the way I understood exactly how this is supposed to work because a power cord is a very very easy thing to break
[01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:08.520]   And what a what a slap in the face would be if it became a very difficult thing to to replace
[01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:11.560]   Here is uh, here he is pulling out
[01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:19.480]   There is a webpage that says don't don't disconnect it, but uh, he pulls it out
[01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:27.560]   It is look how look how shallow it is look how short it is and I like his tik he gets bonus points for the Canadian tik
[01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:29.960]   Nice tik dude nice tik
[01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:35.720]   All right. Yeah, he's brave. He's a brave man, but obviously makes enough money on ltt to uh
[01:41:35.720 --> 01:41:40.520]   To pay for it was hilarious because he was ranting about how it wasn't removable
[01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:44.920]   And then they saw niele's tweet because niele I just pulled it like someone asked and he was like
[01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:45.400]   Yeah, huh?
[01:41:45.400 --> 01:41:48.120]   Lawl and showed the picture of it and they couldn't figure it out
[01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:52.520]   So we went and made them go find the studio to play and bring it down and then he couldn't get it out
[01:41:52.520 --> 01:41:55.720]   Then they looked they thought niele maybe had a an engineering sample and not a real one
[01:41:55.720 --> 01:41:57.720]   So he pulled harder and it finally came out
[01:41:57.720 --> 01:42:03.960]   I mean anything's removable with enough force. Yes, it's
[01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:07.400]   It's what anything placeable. That's the problem. Exactly
[01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:11.880]   Anything exactly anything's removable once
[01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:17.640]   Just like just like every phone could be folded once. Yes, whether it's unfoldable or not that matters
[01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:23.480]   Here is uh x-ray from creative electron via I fix it of the uh max studio
[01:42:23.480 --> 01:42:26.600]   always like these and make nice wallpaper. Yeah, and uh,
[01:42:26.600 --> 01:42:32.280]   Oops, I zoomed in a little too far and then here is the uh, the fan assembly the side
[01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:37.080]   View of the fan assembly. Yeah, be nice. It's not growing doesn't it? Yeah, it's pretty cool looking
[01:42:37.080 --> 01:42:43.000]   It what really blows me away is that it's just this middle thin layer. That's the whole computer
[01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:48.200]   Yeah, 90 percent of the volume is dedicated to power supply and fans
[01:42:48.200 --> 01:42:54.600]   Putting an m1 into an apple keyboard is so interesting because basically you have the apple too all over again, but in a tiny little keyboard
[01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:56.200]   Yeah
[01:42:56.200 --> 01:43:00.520]   And apple id uh or your driver's license as an apple wallet
[01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:01.960]   Uh
[01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:04.840]   Has finally launched in the first state, Arizona
[01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:08.760]   There are other states who have said we're going to do it colorado, hawaii, mrs
[01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:11.480]   Sibi, ohio and terra and the port territory porta rico
[01:43:12.600 --> 01:43:16.360]   Um, you can use this at a tsa checkpoint and some
[01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:19.080]   airports not all yet
[01:43:19.080 --> 01:43:22.760]   It tells you I like this what information is passed off
[01:43:22.760 --> 01:43:25.800]   when you uh
[01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:29.320]   Do the touch to pay or touch to id I guess it would be called
[01:43:29.320 --> 01:43:35.560]   Um, so you know what what they're getting and it I've heard that ultimately you'll be able to choose what they get
[01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:41.000]   Uh tsa wants it all probably so you can use it at phoenix's sky harbor airport
[01:43:41.880 --> 01:43:47.560]   Uh, I presume law enforcement in uh, Arizona has been notified. Oh, yeah
[01:43:47.560 --> 01:43:51.880]   Nothing bad's gonna happen in Arizona. Oh, no, no, no
[01:43:51.880 --> 01:43:54.920]   Sheriff, uh, they said I could use my phone
[01:43:54.920 --> 01:44:01.560]   Got in the car. I said get out of the car. Yeah, Arizona's can add their driver's license or state id to the wallet
[01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:04.680]   And then tap their iphone or apple watch
[01:44:04.680 --> 01:44:09.960]   To uh present your id at the select tsa security checkpoints
[01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:17.800]   Yeah, now that's that's a part of the good thing about that is that you don't have to you don't have to see control of the object
[01:44:17.800 --> 01:44:21.400]   In order to give this person what they're what they're demanding
[01:44:21.400 --> 01:44:26.920]   So this would be a terrible thing if they if you had to hand over your phone for the person to put into a reader
[01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:31.640]   Because that essentially you've you've consented to a lot of things by consenting to hand over phone
[01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:35.720]   By by keeping this in your hand and just allowing them to read it with a device
[01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:40.360]   It will you can control that they only get to see the things that you're permitting them to see love that
[01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:44.120]   So in the case of a traffic stop, that's that's one thing
[01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:48.920]   But it also means that when you try to get into a club that serves alcohol
[01:44:48.920 --> 01:44:56.840]   You can essentially give them you prove that you're over 21 without giving them a card that says here's my here's my address
[01:44:56.840 --> 01:45:01.720]   Uh, here's my data. Excuse me. Here's my address. Here's my full name. Here's a a whole bunch of other things
[01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:08.920]   It's the idea of only giving the agent exactly the amount the amount of information that they require to do their job
[01:45:08.920 --> 01:45:11.160]   And not allowing them to exploit it
[01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:13.560]   By having access to
[01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:16.520]   I that's this girl just take your phone back to my squad car
[01:45:16.520 --> 01:45:21.400]   I'll be back in eight minutes depending on how long the cable to bring on what cable I find in the
[01:45:21.400 --> 01:45:27.560]   Here's what it looks like using your watch at a tsa checkpoint you tap it to the nfc
[01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:30.200]   then you double click
[01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:32.280]   And then it's done
[01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:36.440]   Now, uh, the apple press release does not mention anybody but the tsa
[01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:39.400]   So i'm thinking if you're in arizona and you might want to carry your
[01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:41.480]   drivers license
[01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:45.160]   With you when you drive. I don't I would also make sure that flappy bird was still on there
[01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:49.320]   So if they did take my phone or something on them for them to do without like why you take it so long
[01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:51.000]   No reason bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop.
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:53.980]   I can't imagine that they're going to equipped every trooper
[01:45:53.980 --> 01:45:57.340]   with a handheld card reader device.
[01:45:57.340 --> 01:45:59.980]   But maybe that's the plan, I don't know.
[01:45:59.980 --> 01:46:00.940]   That seems unlikely.
[01:46:00.940 --> 01:46:02.140]   I think that's probably why it's a team's error.
[01:46:02.140 --> 01:46:04.600]   It's a optical Canadian Danoli bonnet.
[01:46:04.600 --> 01:46:05.600]   Yeah.
[01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:06.800]   Well, they can have a phone.
[01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:07.520]   You're right, Jon.
[01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:09.780]   Maybe that's why they've added that that when they
[01:46:09.780 --> 01:46:11.620]   added that pay to pay on a phone, they
[01:46:11.620 --> 01:46:12.580]   ended that as well.
[01:46:12.580 --> 01:46:14.260]   That's interesting.
[01:46:14.260 --> 01:46:16.760]   This is going to be a difficulty that we're going to--
[01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:19.320]   that as a country we might have to kind of address
[01:46:19.320 --> 01:46:23.840]   the problem is that for traditional reasons,
[01:46:23.840 --> 01:46:28.680]   the federal government can't demand that here is what your state
[01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:30.560]   ID has to do.
[01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:31.840]   They have guidelines-- excuse me.
[01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:37.240]   For digital ID, they have issued guidelines as to here
[01:46:37.240 --> 01:46:44.680]   is what we would believe to be a secure and proper amount
[01:46:44.680 --> 01:46:47.480]   of technology to put into a digital ID system.
[01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:50.680]   However, it's not as though there can be a federal ID
[01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:52.320]   that everybody complies to.
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:53.640]   So essentially, every single state
[01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:55.560]   is coming up with their own solutions,
[01:46:55.560 --> 01:46:59.080]   which is why a company like Apple can add a lot of value
[01:46:59.080 --> 01:47:01.080]   here by saying, well, we have a solution that
[01:47:01.080 --> 01:47:04.080]   follows federal guidelines that is also a very future looking,
[01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:06.240]   that is also very privacy oriented,
[01:47:06.240 --> 01:47:09.280]   that you don't really have to spend eight years on a fact
[01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:10.840]   finding Mr. to figure this out.
[01:47:10.840 --> 01:47:14.000]   So it's-- but it's going to be difficult when you have
[01:47:14.000 --> 01:47:18.280]   like an Android standard, when you have an Apple standard,
[01:47:18.280 --> 01:47:20.200]   when you have a Garmin watch standard--
[01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:21.200]   Right.
[01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:23.120]   --we might-- exactly.
[01:47:23.120 --> 01:47:25.480]   We might have to figure out a whole bunch of stuff
[01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:27.200]   in order to make this really work the way that
[01:47:27.200 --> 01:47:28.360]   tap to pay works.
[01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:30.240]   All right, gentlemen, get your picks ready
[01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:32.200]   because picks are the week coming up next.
[01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:33.560]   I just had one last little thing to--
[01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:34.060]   Yes.
[01:47:34.060 --> 01:47:35.760]   Because one thing that you find immediately with all of this
[01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:38.680]   is that when you see people discussing this online--
[01:47:38.680 --> 01:47:40.280]   and this is a surprise to nobody here--
[01:47:40.280 --> 01:47:42.400]   but it's amazing how many people don't understand
[01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:44.800]   that bills of rights and laws and things like that
[01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:47.400]   vary country to country, but also don't mean what
[01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:50.080]   Twitter hot takes really say they mean,
[01:47:50.080 --> 01:47:52.280]   whether it's freedom of speech or licenses
[01:47:52.280 --> 01:47:53.200]   or all of these things.
[01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:55.080]   It's like you actually have to go and look at them.
[01:47:55.080 --> 01:47:57.240]   So do what Andy suggested and go look
[01:47:57.240 --> 01:47:59.280]   at the different states and look at the different countries
[01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:01.600]   even because you'd be surprised.
[01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:05.440]   Functional democracies exist in many weird and wonderful ways.
[01:48:05.440 --> 01:48:08.440]   I've heard there's a country called Canada, a fabled land
[01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:10.960]   north of the 49th parallel that is--
[01:48:10.960 --> 01:48:12.240]   Canada has freedom.
[01:48:12.240 --> 01:48:15.040]   Belljean has freedom.
[01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:16.640]   But Belgium does have poutine.
[01:48:16.640 --> 01:48:18.040]   So--
[01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:18.880]   I hear something--
[01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:20.520]   I'm going to--
[01:48:20.520 --> 01:48:21.760]   every time I'm going to think about that,
[01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:23.840]   I always hear that some day Canada
[01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:27.440]   is going to invade us and then we'll all be sorry.
[01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:28.080]   But the Bureau--
[01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:28.600]   We have water.
[01:48:28.600 --> 01:48:29.360]   It's the other way around.
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:30.080]   Yeah.
[01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:30.760]   We have water.
[01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:31.840]   You can definitely invade us.
[01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:33.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:35.000]   I was asking to set that.
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:35.880]   Get your picks ready.
[01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:37.680]   Picks are the week coming up.
[01:48:37.680 --> 01:48:40.360]   First, I want to tell you how well I slept last night.
[01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:42.960]   I put this eight sleep thing.
[01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:44.920]   Kevin Rose told me about this.
[01:48:44.920 --> 01:48:47.960]   Amy Webb and Kevin Rose were on a twit show together.
[01:48:47.960 --> 01:48:48.920]   Amy bought it.
[01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:50.720]   She said, Leo, you've got to get this.
[01:48:50.720 --> 01:48:53.000]   It's the best sleep we've ever had.
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:56.480]   Eight sleep is a breakthrough.
[01:48:56.480 --> 01:48:58.640]   I think it's amazing.
[01:48:58.640 --> 01:49:01.000]   And one of the biggest problems people have with sleep
[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:02.000]   is temperature, right?
[01:49:02.000 --> 01:49:04.560]   Sleeping too hot, too cold.
[01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:05.920]   Eight sleep solves this.
[01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:07.840]   We have an eight sleep pod pro cover.
[01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:10.320]   You can also get a pod pro mattress.
[01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:13.400]   The cover went right over our mattress.
[01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:16.200]   And then it is a very advanced solution
[01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:18.320]   that pairs not only heating.
[01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:20.560]   So your bed is nice and cozy, for instance,
[01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:23.520]   when you get in bed, but dynamic cooling.
[01:49:23.520 --> 01:49:26.240]   And it does it with biometric tracking.
[01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:29.920]   So it can go as cool as 55 degrees.
[01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:30.800]   This is Fahrenheit.
[01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:33.760]   Or as hot as 110 degrees.
[01:49:33.760 --> 01:49:35.960]   And you get to choose, but it also
[01:49:35.960 --> 01:49:40.280]   will monitor your sleep and adjust it accordingly.
[01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:43.680]   The temperature of the cover adjusts two sides, by the way.
[01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:46.240]   Lisa likes to sleep hotter than I do.
[01:49:46.240 --> 01:49:49.000]   And it does it based on your sleep stages on biometrics,
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:50.960]   the bedroom temperature.
[01:49:50.960 --> 01:49:52.560]   It reacts intelligently to create
[01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:54.240]   the optimal sleeping environment.
[01:49:54.240 --> 01:49:57.320]   And somebody explained it to me this way.
[01:49:57.320 --> 01:50:00.320]   Our bodies are built for an earlier time
[01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:04.160]   when we were sleeping in a perhaps less civilized environment
[01:50:04.160 --> 01:50:06.640]   where maybe it was warmer when you went to bed
[01:50:06.640 --> 01:50:08.480]   and the fire had we just put out,
[01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:10.960]   but it got colder as the night went by.
[01:50:10.960 --> 01:50:12.760]   Your body expects that.
[01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:16.400]   And then you wake up and you want to warm it up again.
[01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:18.440]   And that's how I have my eight sleep set, by the way.
[01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:19.880]   And probably most of you will.
[01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:21.240]   So it starts nice and cozy.
[01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:22.680]   I get in and it's very comfortable.
[01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:25.080]   Lisa always loves that feeling she gets in bed.
[01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:26.120]   Oh, it's warm.
[01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:26.480]   It's nice.
[01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:27.680]   Oh, it's so good.
[01:50:27.680 --> 01:50:29.080]   Now she likes to keep it pretty warm.
[01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:30.920]   I let it cool off as the night goes by.
[01:50:30.920 --> 01:50:33.800]   And I notice I do sleep much more deeply.
[01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:37.560]   And then it's set to wake me by warming up.
[01:50:37.560 --> 01:50:39.400]   Now, this is the thing I like the best because I don't know
[01:50:39.400 --> 01:50:41.480]   about you, but the worst thing in the winter,
[01:50:41.480 --> 01:50:44.600]   the worst thing my whole life is getting out of bed.
[01:50:44.600 --> 01:50:48.920]   You're nice and cozy in bed and it's freezing out.
[01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:51.360]   Or worse, the covers have fallen off overnight
[01:50:51.360 --> 01:50:53.200]   and you're freezing in bed.
[01:50:53.200 --> 01:50:54.040]   I love this.
[01:50:54.040 --> 01:50:56.280]   It puts you to sleep in record time.
[01:50:56.280 --> 01:51:00.120]   It keeps you asleep and then you wake up naturally
[01:51:00.120 --> 01:51:03.320]   at the time you said it's the pod pro cover.
[01:51:03.320 --> 01:51:04.360]   It's eight sleep.
[01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:05.560]   I want to say the name again.
[01:51:05.560 --> 01:51:06.520]   I haven't said it enough.
[01:51:06.520 --> 01:51:09.240]   Eight is spelled out E-I-G-H-T.
[01:51:09.240 --> 01:51:12.480]   It is the most advanced solution on the market for thermal
[01:51:12.480 --> 01:51:15.800]   regulation and it really, really works.
[01:51:15.800 --> 01:51:19.160]   Reduce sleep interruptions by 40% and overall get more
[01:51:19.160 --> 01:51:20.840]   restful sleep.
[01:51:20.840 --> 01:51:25.400]   You will wake up feeling incredible, ready for,
[01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:28.400]   you know, anything that might come along during the day.
[01:51:28.400 --> 01:51:31.840]   It's vital for physical recovery, hormone regulation,
[01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:35.880]   mental clarity, show up as the best partner, parent,
[01:51:35.880 --> 01:51:41.000]   or version of yourself powered by eight sleep.
[01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.480]   I am totally a believer.
[01:51:43.480 --> 01:51:46.560]   Amy Webb and Kevin Rose convinced me once we got it.
[01:51:46.560 --> 01:51:49.560]   We've had it now for some months.
[01:51:49.560 --> 01:51:50.480]   It's amazing.
[01:51:50.480 --> 01:51:51.560]   It's so nice.
[01:51:51.560 --> 01:51:54.000]   Oh, see, Leo Laporta proved.
[01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:58.760]   It's all done kind of automatically, which is really nice.
[01:51:58.760 --> 01:52:02.200]   You know, I know when I get in bed, it's going to be warm.
[01:52:02.200 --> 01:52:04.040]   And it's going to cool off.
[01:52:04.040 --> 01:52:05.640]   It's going to get warm again in the morning.
[01:52:05.640 --> 01:52:06.840]   That's how I have it said.
[01:52:06.840 --> 01:52:08.640]   Eight sleep.com/Macbreak.
[01:52:08.640 --> 01:52:13.560]   You'll save $150 a check out when you get the Pod Pro cover.
[01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:17.400]   Eight sleep currently ships within the US, Canada, and the UK.
[01:52:17.400 --> 01:52:20.080]   US, Canada, and UK.

[01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:29.320]   Good night's sleep is the Holy Grail.
[01:52:29.320 --> 01:52:31.560]   I will do almost anything to sleep better.
[01:52:31.560 --> 01:52:33.960]   And as you get older, sleep gets lighter.
[01:52:33.960 --> 01:52:35.160]   Your sleep is not as good.
[01:52:35.160 --> 01:52:38.480]   This has made a big difference for both me and Lisa.
[01:52:38.480 --> 01:52:41.080]   She's not as old as I am, but she loves it.
[01:52:41.080 --> 01:52:44.880]   She's got a sore muscle.
[01:52:44.880 --> 01:52:49.040]   She exercises too much, I think, on her side.
[01:52:49.040 --> 01:52:51.160]   But it's like having a little heating pad on it.
[01:52:51.160 --> 01:52:52.040]   It's just really nice.
[01:52:52.040 --> 01:52:53.160]   It's really wonderful.
[01:52:53.160 --> 01:52:57.960]   Eight sleep.com/Macbreak.
[01:52:57.960 --> 01:53:00.520]   Thank you so much for their support of Mac Break Weekly,
[01:53:00.520 --> 01:53:01.960]   the Dark Tipper Approves.
[01:53:01.960 --> 01:53:04.040]   That's right.
[01:53:04.040 --> 01:53:05.200]   Micah, you have one too.
[01:53:05.200 --> 01:53:06.560]   I didn't know that.
[01:53:06.560 --> 01:53:08.080]   Micah says he's a believer too.
[01:53:08.080 --> 01:53:09.600]   Nice.
[01:53:09.600 --> 01:53:10.440]   Very nice.
[01:53:10.440 --> 01:53:11.560]   All right, pick of the week time.
[01:53:11.560 --> 01:53:14.800]   Let's start with Renee Richie.
[01:53:14.800 --> 01:53:16.840]   So just because the world is so silly right now,
[01:53:16.840 --> 01:53:19.040]   I wanted to pick something that was just so much fun,
[01:53:19.040 --> 01:53:19.720]   a lot of fun.
[01:53:19.720 --> 01:53:22.320]   And I realize people are probably really familiar with this
[01:53:22.320 --> 01:53:23.880]   already, but in case you aren't,
[01:53:23.880 --> 01:53:26.040]   it is so worth a few minutes of your time.
[01:53:26.040 --> 01:53:28.720]   I'm talking about Montreal YouTuber, Ryan George,
[01:53:28.720 --> 01:53:30.680]   who you might know from doing all this screen
[01:53:30.680 --> 01:53:33.560]   rant pitch meeting videos where he shows that you don't need
[01:53:33.560 --> 01:53:35.640]   a lot of fancy equipment or anything just--
[01:53:35.640 --> 01:53:37.440]   yeah, just I'm going to stop talking for a second.
[01:53:37.440 --> 01:53:38.400]   Can you start that one?
[01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:39.600]   Should I turn on the audio?
[01:53:39.600 --> 01:53:41.320]   This is Superman Does Good.
[01:53:41.320 --> 01:53:42.040]   Oh, it's short.
[01:53:42.040 --> 01:53:43.000]   Hey, Clark Kent.
[01:53:43.000 --> 01:53:43.520]   Good morning.
[01:53:43.520 --> 01:53:44.320]   How you doing?
[01:53:44.320 --> 01:53:45.680]   Oh, I'm doing good.
[01:53:45.680 --> 01:53:47.560]   Actually, Superman Does Good.
[01:53:47.560 --> 01:53:48.640]   You're doing well.
[01:53:48.640 --> 01:53:50.640]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:54.440]   [BLEEP]
[01:53:54.440 --> 01:53:57.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:53:57.520 --> 01:53:59.760]   I bet you Superman is tempted to do that.
[01:53:59.760 --> 01:54:02.800]   So these are like almost like TikToks.
[01:54:02.800 --> 01:54:03.800]   They're short.
[01:54:03.800 --> 01:54:05.360]   He did this a long time ago before TikTok.
[01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:06.640]   And most of his videos are long now.
[01:54:06.640 --> 01:54:08.040]   They're four minutes to six minutes.
[01:54:08.040 --> 01:54:10.120]   And he does them-- there's a new screen rant channel
[01:54:10.120 --> 01:54:13.120]   that just debuted where they moved his pitch meetings off to.
[01:54:13.120 --> 01:54:14.640]   And pitch meeting is famous.
[01:54:14.640 --> 01:54:17.360]   It's like he goes into pitch a movie that we've all seen.
[01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:20.600]   And he tears the movie apart in the funniest way imaginable
[01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:23.280]   by being the writer who's pitching it to the studio guy.
[01:54:23.280 --> 01:54:25.600]   And the writer is every worst cliche about writers.
[01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:28.960]   The studio guy is every worst cliche about studio guys.
[01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:31.840]   And he plays both parts on two different green screens.
[01:54:31.840 --> 01:54:34.760]   So you really don't have to have a lot of equipment to do this.
[01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:35.440]   And he's famous.
[01:54:35.440 --> 01:54:37.960]   He's like pitching Game of Thrones season eight.
[01:54:37.960 --> 01:54:39.480]   And he's like, she goes away on a horse.
[01:54:39.480 --> 01:54:40.760]   And then comes back on foot.
[01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:41.680]   What about the horse?
[01:54:41.680 --> 01:54:42.560]   We forgot about the horse.
[01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:44.120]   It was a very forgettable horse.
[01:54:44.120 --> 01:54:47.200]   And he goes through bit by bit about all
[01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:48.040]   these things.
[01:54:48.040 --> 01:54:48.560]   Is he a comic?
[01:54:48.560 --> 01:54:49.600]   Was he a comic first?
[01:54:49.600 --> 01:54:50.080]   Yes.
[01:54:50.080 --> 01:54:50.600]   OK.
[01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:50.920]   Yeah.
[01:54:50.920 --> 01:54:51.600]   He's a comic.
[01:54:51.600 --> 01:54:52.680]   And he does sketches.
[01:54:52.680 --> 01:54:56.200]   And they get millions of views on screen raps.
[01:54:56.200 --> 01:54:57.240]   But he has his own channel.
[01:54:57.240 --> 01:54:59.360]   And he's famous for doing the first guy ever
[01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:01.840]   to commit a crime, or the first guy ever to be arrested.
[01:55:01.840 --> 01:55:03.640]   And the couple come in and say, we decided to put you
[01:55:03.640 --> 01:55:04.720]   in this room for several years.
[01:55:04.720 --> 01:55:05.640]   We decided.
[01:55:05.640 --> 01:55:07.920]   And they just try to figure out what's going on.
[01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:10.240]   But he works with Julie Milke, sometimes
[01:55:10.240 --> 01:55:11.520]   another famous sketch artist.
[01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:13.720]   But they make you laugh.
[01:55:13.720 --> 01:55:15.400]   We need this.
[01:55:15.400 --> 01:55:16.480]   Yeah, we need this.
[01:55:16.480 --> 01:55:18.200]   And he's gotten through a million subscribers.
[01:55:18.200 --> 01:55:19.600]   I mean, his channel is really well known.
[01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:21.480]   But in case you just need a little bit of sunshine
[01:55:21.480 --> 01:55:22.000]   in your day.
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:24.000]   Ryan George.
[01:55:24.000 --> 01:55:25.160]   Ryan George.
[01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:27.000]   If you could just show a few seconds of the other one,
[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:27.640]   I think people will be--
[01:55:27.640 --> 01:55:27.840]   Which one?
[01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:28.840]   Screwdriver?
[01:55:28.840 --> 01:55:29.320]   Like two.
[01:55:29.320 --> 01:55:29.840]   Which one?
[01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:31.720]   No, in the Google Doc.
[01:55:31.720 --> 01:55:32.600]   Oh, OK.
[01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:35.240]   I put one of the screen raps videos in there as well.
[01:55:35.240 --> 01:55:35.760]   OK.
[01:55:35.760 --> 01:55:37.000]   Yeah, let me show it.
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:37.920]   Here we go.
[01:55:37.920 --> 01:55:40.400]   This is Game of Thrones season eight pitch meeting.
[01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:42.520]   So you have Game of Thrones season eight for me?
[01:55:42.520 --> 01:55:43.560]   Yes, sir, I do.
[01:55:43.560 --> 01:55:45.000]   When I really want this to be over,
[01:55:45.000 --> 01:55:46.760]   so can we speed this pitch meeting up late?
[01:55:46.760 --> 01:55:48.440]   Oh, I mean, we literally just started.
[01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:49.400]   Well, I'm in a rush.
[01:55:49.400 --> 01:55:50.840]   So, you know, let's get cracking.
[01:55:50.840 --> 01:55:51.560]   I mean, OK.
[01:55:51.560 --> 01:55:53.160]   So anyway, the first two episodes are going
[01:55:53.160 --> 01:55:56.160]   to be people kind of meeting and reuniting in Winterfell.
[01:55:56.160 --> 01:55:58.120]   You know, Aria's going to sleep with Gendry.
[01:55:58.120 --> 01:55:59.840]   Oh, having seen her grow up on the show,
[01:55:59.840 --> 01:56:01.560]   that makes me extremely uncomfortable.
[01:56:01.560 --> 01:56:02.280]   Is she 18?
[01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:04.120]   But certainly what people are going to Google.
[01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:04.960]   But yes, she is.
[01:56:04.960 --> 01:56:05.720]   Yikes, OK.
[01:56:05.720 --> 01:56:07.960]   And then episode three is going to be when the Night King
[01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:10.080]   and his army are going to arrive in Winterfell.
[01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:10.920]   Oh, my God.
[01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:13.360]   The moment we've been building towards for eight seasons.
[01:56:13.360 --> 01:56:15.680]   Yeah, and so Bran reveals that the Night King wants him,
[01:56:15.680 --> 01:56:17.920]   because he's kind of like the memory of Westeros.
[01:56:17.920 --> 01:56:18.360]   Oh, why?
[01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:19.720]   Because that's his motivation.
[01:56:19.720 --> 01:56:20.560]   We're OK then.
[01:56:20.560 --> 01:56:22.800]   So then the Dothraki charge at the dead army.
[01:56:22.800 --> 01:56:24.040]   And they're pretty much all get way down.
[01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:26.880]   I'm getting a little bit of PTSD reliving season eight.
[01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:28.240]   So I'm going to stop right now.
[01:56:28.240 --> 01:56:29.200]   Well, that's the whole point.
[01:56:29.200 --> 01:56:29.760]   Yeah, that's all.
[01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:32.400]   Yeah, but he's-- and the movies that you hate,
[01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:34.640]   he justifies why you hate those movies.
[01:56:34.640 --> 01:56:37.360]   But the movies that you love, he'll tear apart
[01:56:37.360 --> 01:56:38.400]   like the original Star Wars.
[01:56:38.400 --> 01:56:39.680]   And you have to agree with them.
[01:56:39.680 --> 01:56:40.800]   And you're laughing along with them,
[01:56:40.800 --> 01:56:41.680]   even though you don't care.
[01:56:41.680 --> 01:56:42.640]   You love it anyway.
[01:56:42.640 --> 01:56:44.680]   But he gets you to acknowledge that a lot of this stuff
[01:56:44.680 --> 01:56:45.280]   is subjective.
[01:56:45.280 --> 01:56:46.720]   And you can love bad movies.
[01:56:46.720 --> 01:56:47.600]   You can hate good movies.
[01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:48.160]   It's all good.
[01:56:48.160 --> 01:56:48.640]   It's fine.
[01:56:48.640 --> 01:56:50.920]   That's from the Screen Range Channel, which
[01:56:50.920 --> 01:56:53.080]   has 8 and 1/2 million subscribers.
[01:56:53.080 --> 01:56:55.960]   So you see, but there are other people on Screen Rant?
[01:56:55.960 --> 01:56:56.560]   Or--
[01:56:56.560 --> 01:56:58.400]   Yeah, so they just moved that over to a new channel
[01:56:58.400 --> 01:56:59.120]   called Pitch Meeting.
[01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:00.440]   So all the new Pitch Meeting.
[01:57:00.440 --> 01:57:01.480]   It's all on Pitch Meeting.
[01:57:01.480 --> 01:57:02.320]   Oh, nice.
[01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:02.800]   Yeah.
[01:57:02.800 --> 01:57:03.880]   Good pick.
[01:57:03.880 --> 01:57:04.760]   Thank you, Renee.
[01:57:04.760 --> 01:57:05.680]   Andy and Akko.
[01:57:05.680 --> 01:57:06.320]   Just make us laugh.
[01:57:06.320 --> 01:57:07.840]   Pick-- yeah, we need to laugh.
[01:57:07.840 --> 01:57:09.720]   Pick of the week.
[01:57:09.720 --> 01:57:15.560]   Big update to one of iOS's best apps,
[01:57:15.560 --> 01:57:19.160]   Marco Armin's podcatcher, which--
[01:57:19.160 --> 01:57:20.800]   sorry.
[01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:23.080]   I almost lost the thing there.
[01:57:23.080 --> 01:57:23.840]   Sorry.
[01:57:23.840 --> 01:57:27.440]   Yeah, overcast, which essentially--
[01:57:27.440 --> 01:57:29.280]   what I love about Marco Armin as a developer
[01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:32.440]   is that he has a unique and a specific point of view.
[01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:35.040]   He makes something because he feels as though this thing needs
[01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:37.240]   to be made up of multiple points of view.
[01:57:37.240 --> 01:57:37.880]   I agree.
[01:57:37.880 --> 01:57:38.360]   Exactly.
[01:57:38.360 --> 01:57:39.360]   I agree.
[01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:41.360]   And that was absolutely demonstrative
[01:57:41.360 --> 01:57:43.400]   when the first version of Overcast came out.
[01:57:43.400 --> 01:57:45.920]   I don't think there was any other podcatcher
[01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:49.080]   that really put so much emphasis on the act of listening
[01:57:49.080 --> 01:57:50.520]   to a podcast.
[01:57:50.520 --> 01:57:51.880]   It was so many podcatchers.
[01:57:51.880 --> 01:57:53.680]   We're just very, very technical.
[01:57:53.680 --> 01:57:56.800]   And this is-- he just released what he said
[01:57:56.800 --> 01:58:00.920]   is the biggest visual, at least, update to the thing
[01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:01.840]   in eight years.
[01:58:01.840 --> 01:58:05.200]   He totally rethought what the visual interface should be like.
[01:58:05.200 --> 01:58:07.520]   And it is much, much prettier.
[01:58:07.520 --> 01:58:09.040]   It is much less minimalist.
[01:58:09.040 --> 01:58:12.000]   I think when it first came out, it was very much an iOS 7
[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:15.000]   aesthetic, which is anything that catches your eye,
[01:58:15.000 --> 01:58:18.440]   remove it because it's catching your eye.
[01:58:18.440 --> 01:58:20.840]   But the two big things I really love about it
[01:58:20.840 --> 01:58:23.360]   is that although I've always loved the playback
[01:58:23.360 --> 01:58:26.480]   features of Overcast, the only thing I didn't like about it
[01:58:26.480 --> 01:58:30.360]   is that sometimes it wasn't as great at managing these.
[01:58:30.360 --> 01:58:33.800]   You've got subscriptions to 40, 50 podcasts, of which maybe
[01:58:33.800 --> 01:58:36.360]   there are three today you want to take a look at.
[01:58:36.360 --> 01:58:38.920]   And sometimes it didn't make it as easy as it could
[01:58:38.920 --> 01:58:41.720]   to identify those podcasts that, hey, I'm
[01:58:41.720 --> 01:58:43.400]   going to be going for an hour-long walk.
[01:58:43.400 --> 01:58:45.840]   Here's the show that I want to listen to right now.
[01:58:45.840 --> 01:58:47.920]   So it makes it much, much easier to discover the ones that
[01:58:47.920 --> 01:58:50.240]   here are new podcatchers, the new ones that came out today.
[01:58:50.240 --> 01:58:52.040]   Here are the ones that you were recently listening to
[01:58:52.040 --> 01:58:54.320]   that maybe you abandoned in the middle.
[01:58:54.320 --> 01:58:57.200]   And if you have a playlist of specific podcasts
[01:58:57.200 --> 01:58:59.120]   that you use for the Morning Drive,
[01:58:59.120 --> 01:59:01.720]   you can put those playlists just front and center,
[01:59:01.720 --> 01:59:04.920]   first order of retrievability on the user interface.
[01:59:04.920 --> 01:59:07.200]   And also he added something that was very, very basic,
[01:59:07.200 --> 01:59:10.400]   I thought, which is simply to say, just mark something as read,
[01:59:10.400 --> 01:59:13.200]   or mark something as listened to, and basically remove it
[01:59:13.200 --> 01:59:15.000]   from my consciousness completely,
[01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:16.320]   because I thank you.
[01:59:16.320 --> 01:59:21.400]   I don't want to hear this actor who, I guess,
[01:59:21.400 --> 01:59:23.480]   a movie every three months, and he spends every interview
[01:59:23.480 --> 01:59:25.320]   talking about how much weed he smokes.
[01:59:25.320 --> 01:59:26.120]   Thank you very much.
[01:59:26.120 --> 01:59:28.080]   I don't need to hear that again.
[01:59:28.080 --> 01:59:29.920]   So I'm just going to mark that as listened to.
[01:59:29.920 --> 01:59:33.200]   So if anything else, it's a great opportunity
[01:59:33.200 --> 01:59:36.920]   to once again sing the praises of "Overcast."
[01:59:36.920 --> 01:59:41.080]   If Marco weren't Marco, I think that Apple
[01:59:41.080 --> 01:59:43.200]   would have bought this app a long time ago,
[01:59:43.200 --> 01:59:46.760]   because it is so much better than the built-in podcast app.
[01:59:46.760 --> 01:59:50.160]   It is so much more user focused, it's so much cleaner,
[01:59:50.160 --> 01:59:51.720]   and I'm just glad it exists.
[01:59:51.720 --> 01:59:53.560]   And this is a major, major update.
[01:59:53.560 --> 01:59:57.880]   I'm very, very, I really want to applaud all the work
[01:59:57.880 --> 02:00:02.000]   that's gone into this, because it is a resource
[02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:05.440]   that iOS absolutely needed.
[02:00:05.440 --> 02:00:07.600]   - Overcast.fm.
[02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:09.200]   - Of course, you're going to put it on your iPhone,
[02:00:09.200 --> 02:00:11.400]   so you should probably go to the iPhone store to get it.
[02:00:11.400 --> 02:00:12.240]   How much is it?
[02:00:12.240 --> 02:00:13.080]   Is it free?
[02:00:13.080 --> 02:00:17.320]   - No, it's, I think you forgot.
[02:00:17.320 --> 02:00:18.160]   - It's not a subscription.
[02:00:18.160 --> 02:00:21.720]   - I tipped as much as I possibly could for the next 100 years.
[02:00:21.720 --> 02:00:22.560]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:00:22.560 --> 02:00:24.480]   - So that, you know, just upfront.
[02:00:24.480 --> 02:00:26.320]   - Yeah, the only negative information from Apple--
[02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:27.160]   - It is free.
[02:00:27.160 --> 02:00:28.000]   - It's free, yeah.
[02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:28.840]   - It's free.
[02:00:28.840 --> 02:00:32.600]   - Free supported by small visual ads from a podcast,
[02:00:32.600 --> 02:00:34.080]   but you can hide them for $10 a year.
[02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:34.920]   - There you go.
[02:00:34.920 --> 02:00:36.440]   - I see the ads 10 bucks a year.
[02:00:36.440 --> 02:00:37.280]   - And the price.
[02:00:37.280 --> 02:00:41.760]   - And the only knock at all on it is that it doesn't do video
[02:00:41.760 --> 02:00:43.480]   and some, all of our shows have video,
[02:00:43.480 --> 02:00:45.120]   but if you're just an audio listener,
[02:00:45.120 --> 02:00:48.000]   which most people are, overcast is a great choice.
[02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:49.440]   And it has the speed up function,
[02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:52.160]   which everybody wants for our shows.
[02:00:52.160 --> 02:00:54.400]   Listen to it twice, the speed, and get twice as much done.
[02:00:54.400 --> 02:00:56.360]   - I trained on old debug episodes.
[02:00:56.360 --> 02:00:57.360]   That's not anecdotal either.
[02:00:57.360 --> 02:00:58.200]   - Is that true?
[02:00:58.200 --> 02:00:59.040]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[02:00:59.040 --> 02:00:59.880]   - Yeah, Guy Ingl, when I, Guy Ingl,
[02:00:59.880 --> 02:01:01.120]   I used to host that podcast.
[02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:03.200]   I speak very fast and Guy has pregnant pauses
[02:01:03.200 --> 02:01:04.320]   that last in episode or two.
[02:01:04.320 --> 02:01:05.920]   (laughing)
[02:01:05.920 --> 02:01:07.480]   - The best shows that he could tune.
[02:01:07.480 --> 02:01:10.000]   (laughing)
[02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.280]   - Alex Lindsay, pick of the week.
[02:01:12.280 --> 02:01:13.880]   - So we were talking about production
[02:01:13.880 --> 02:01:15.040]   this morning on phones,
[02:01:15.040 --> 02:01:18.600]   and I thought I would show something that we talked about.
[02:01:18.600 --> 02:01:19.440]   - This is hysterical.
[02:01:19.440 --> 02:01:23.200]   - This is actually the inspiration for a lot of this is,
[02:01:23.200 --> 02:01:25.760]   Tom Ferguson, who's one of our folks in office hours,
[02:01:25.760 --> 02:01:26.600]   you know, we were talking about it.
[02:01:26.600 --> 02:01:27.800]   He's, "Oh, but this is the best rig."
[02:01:27.800 --> 02:01:29.520]   And I looked at his rig and I was like,
[02:01:29.520 --> 02:01:30.680]   "Oh, I have to buy one of those."
[02:01:30.680 --> 02:01:32.560]   And I said, "I bought one and then I bought two more."
[02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:33.880]   So I have like three of these rigs.
[02:01:33.880 --> 02:01:37.400]   And so this is the small rig,
[02:01:37.400 --> 02:01:39.480]   sort of small, yeah, small rig rig.
[02:01:39.480 --> 02:01:42.200]   The small rig really started with like SLR phones.
[02:01:42.200 --> 02:01:43.720]   And so the fact that they're making them,
[02:01:43.720 --> 02:01:47.240]   they make such an amazing collection of these for iPhones.
[02:01:47.240 --> 02:01:51.240]   So you have quarter 20s, these are all quarter 20 mounts
[02:01:51.240 --> 02:01:53.120]   on pretty much every angle.
[02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:54.960]   This handle is just one of the accessories
[02:01:54.960 --> 02:01:56.520]   that just kind of screws in.
[02:01:56.520 --> 02:01:58.240]   It's got more quarter 20s on the top.
[02:01:58.240 --> 02:02:00.680]   And so for a lot of us building complex rigs with this,
[02:02:00.680 --> 02:02:02.600]   it is, it's just a beast.
[02:02:02.600 --> 02:02:04.160]   And they make a couple different ones.
[02:02:04.160 --> 02:02:06.440]   What's funny is there's another iPhone
[02:02:06.440 --> 02:02:10.120]   that is attached to my mic stand
[02:02:10.120 --> 02:02:13.120]   that is the phone that's shooting the phone right now.
[02:02:13.120 --> 02:02:16.480]   So it's, you know, using it kind of in that process.
[02:02:16.480 --> 02:02:19.000]   But you can also put moment lenses.
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:20.200]   These are just the mounts.
[02:02:20.200 --> 02:02:23.000]   So you can take moment lenses and screw them on there.
[02:02:23.000 --> 02:02:25.000]   So it kind of builds that all in.
[02:02:25.000 --> 02:02:26.960]   And it's really nice.
[02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:29.640]   And especially as a lot of us have gotten to
[02:02:29.640 --> 02:02:31.880]   start to use these for more and more production.
[02:02:31.880 --> 02:02:34.280]   I mean, oops, sorry, hit the wrong button.
[02:02:34.280 --> 02:02:39.280]   The, I'm not buying the whole like we could build a film with this.
[02:02:39.280 --> 02:02:44.480]   But what I will say is we can build a lot of training.
[02:02:44.480 --> 02:02:47.600]   We can build a lot of communications, news, gathering,
[02:02:47.600 --> 02:02:49.680]   all kinds of stuff with these phones at this point.
[02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:52.240]   But what's missing is usually being able to mount them.
[02:02:52.240 --> 02:02:55.760]   You know, and so I still have another one from Peak Design
[02:02:55.760 --> 02:02:57.080]   that I like on a day to day basis.
[02:02:57.080 --> 02:02:59.240]   But for the phones that are doing production,
[02:02:59.240 --> 02:03:01.880]   these are just incredible erector sets of,
[02:03:01.880 --> 02:03:05.800]   I want to put a bunch of, you know, stuff onto my phone
[02:03:05.800 --> 02:03:08.440]   and make it and really, you know, have all the features
[02:03:08.440 --> 02:03:10.360]   that I need to do a more professional job.
[02:03:10.360 --> 02:03:12.760]   And you really can produce some pretty great content.
[02:03:12.760 --> 02:03:14.920]   I built, I built most of my like how to training
[02:03:14.920 --> 02:03:17.080]   for some of our kits and so on and so forth.
[02:03:17.080 --> 02:03:19.200]   It's just too much trouble to use a real camera.
[02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:21.120]   Like I just use, I just take my iPhone and I,
[02:03:21.120 --> 02:03:23.680]   and I grab one of these rigs and I start to just shoot
[02:03:23.680 --> 02:03:24.760]   the things that I need to shoot.
[02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:26.320]   And it's just, it's great.
[02:03:26.320 --> 02:03:28.360]   The cooking stuff that we do in office hours or after hours,
[02:03:28.360 --> 02:03:31.440]   we, I have three iPhones that shoot all of that, you know?
[02:03:31.440 --> 02:03:33.880]   And so it's quite a thing.
[02:03:33.880 --> 02:03:35.320]   So they've come a long way.
[02:03:35.320 --> 02:03:38.120]   - For Hank, I think Hank would probably like it a lot.
[02:03:38.120 --> 02:03:42.680]   It's super, it just, it, it's surprising how much it takes.
[02:03:42.680 --> 02:03:44.360]   It's, I thought that I didn't really need it.
[02:03:44.360 --> 02:03:45.760]   I was like, oh, I have one of those little clamps.
[02:03:45.760 --> 02:03:46.760]   That'll just work.
[02:03:46.760 --> 02:03:48.840]   But the reality is once you start throwing it into this rig,
[02:03:48.840 --> 02:03:50.720]   you start just thinking about other things you can do
[02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:54.000]   and you start attaching them and it gives you a,
[02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:55.480]   yeah, it's easy and fun.
[02:03:55.480 --> 02:03:58.280]   So small rig, it's, I didn't even know
[02:03:58.280 --> 02:03:59.640]   that they were making them until like a week ago
[02:03:59.640 --> 02:04:01.440]   until it came up in office hours.
[02:04:01.440 --> 02:04:02.960]   - So they make rigs for everything,
[02:04:02.960 --> 02:04:05.120]   but they have iPhone rigs, which is,
[02:04:05.120 --> 02:04:06.320]   well, it's funny as I use the small rigs
[02:04:06.320 --> 02:04:07.680]   on all my Blackmagic cameras too.
[02:04:07.680 --> 02:04:09.520]   So they're bigger cages, you know,
[02:04:09.520 --> 02:04:10.560]   for my Blackmagic cameras,
[02:04:10.560 --> 02:04:12.160]   but I didn't know that they made them for phones
[02:04:12.160 --> 02:04:13.000]   until last week.
[02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:15.040]   So, and as soon as I got them, I was like, oh, this,
[02:04:15.040 --> 02:04:17.440]   I went out and bought one and bought two more
[02:04:17.440 --> 02:04:20.400]   and I've been using them for all the rigs that I'm--
[02:04:20.400 --> 02:04:22.240]   - Not just phones, you can use your iPad
[02:04:22.240 --> 02:04:25.160]   that do some Samsung and Huawei phones as well.
[02:04:25.160 --> 02:04:26.000]   - Yeah.
[02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:27.160]   - That's really pretty cool.
[02:04:27.160 --> 02:04:28.000]   - I love that.
[02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:29.720]   - Yeah, they also have a universal mount,
[02:04:29.720 --> 02:04:30.880]   but yeah, you'd wanna get the one
[02:04:30.880 --> 02:04:32.480]   that fits your phone exactly.
[02:04:32.480 --> 02:04:33.320]   That's pretty cool.
[02:04:33.320 --> 02:04:35.600]   - Good pick.
[02:04:35.600 --> 02:04:36.440]   Thank you, Alex.
[02:04:36.440 --> 02:04:37.640]   Alex is at 090.media.
[02:04:37.640 --> 02:04:38.920]   If you wanna hire him,
[02:04:38.920 --> 02:04:42.680]   officehours.global is on the air all the time.
[02:04:42.680 --> 02:04:48.120]   But the big hour is what eight to nine AM Pacific, right?
[02:04:48.120 --> 02:04:49.840]   - It's actually, well, it's seven to nine
[02:04:49.840 --> 02:04:51.080]   and it's 70 office hours.
[02:04:51.080 --> 02:04:52.520]   And that's when we're doing kind of high,
[02:04:52.520 --> 02:04:53.920]   just answering people's questions
[02:04:53.920 --> 02:04:55.320]   and talking about different subjects.
[02:04:55.320 --> 02:04:59.920]   And then in after hours, runs the rest of the day.
[02:04:59.920 --> 02:05:02.680]   And it's funny, it's just the most geeky water cooler
[02:05:02.680 --> 02:05:03.520]   in the world.
[02:05:03.520 --> 02:05:04.600]   You know, like you just go up there
[02:05:04.600 --> 02:05:06.920]   and you've got a question for media folks.
[02:05:06.920 --> 02:05:08.560]   This is for me, like literally,
[02:05:08.560 --> 02:05:09.640]   I'm trying to figure something out.
[02:05:09.640 --> 02:05:10.720]   I'll just jump up in after hours
[02:05:10.720 --> 02:05:12.760]   and I'll be like, hey, Mickey.
[02:05:12.760 --> 02:05:13.600]   Are you there?
[02:05:13.600 --> 02:05:14.720]   And they'll just go a whole bunch of cameras
[02:05:14.720 --> 02:05:16.480]   that are all off and someone turns the camera on,
[02:05:16.480 --> 02:05:17.320]   I go, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:05:17.320 --> 02:05:18.480]   And then you start talking about something
[02:05:18.480 --> 02:05:20.120]   and then you go back to what you were doing
[02:05:20.120 --> 02:05:22.000]   and it's way faster than Google.
[02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:23.840]   - Way better.
[02:05:23.840 --> 02:05:25.600]   - You actually have people that you know,
[02:05:25.600 --> 02:05:26.680]   know what they're talking about.
[02:05:26.680 --> 02:05:30.920]   - And of course today's episode was all about rigs
[02:05:30.920 --> 02:05:32.160]   for your iPhone.
[02:05:32.160 --> 02:05:35.040]   - About the rigs and tomorrow we'll dig into green screen
[02:05:35.040 --> 02:05:37.520]   in a fair bit of detail.
[02:05:37.520 --> 02:05:39.960]   - Office hours.global, you fill out a form there
[02:05:39.960 --> 02:05:41.320]   if you want to get an invitation to the Zoom
[02:05:41.320 --> 02:05:42.320]   or you could just watch.
[02:05:42.320 --> 02:05:47.400]   - Mr. Andy Naka, when will you be on GBH next?
[02:05:47.400 --> 02:05:50.520]   - My usual time, 1230 in the afternoon on Friday,
[02:05:50.520 --> 02:05:54.800]   go to wgphnews.org to stream it live or later.
[02:05:54.800 --> 02:05:58.120]   And it looks like I will be at the Boston Public Library Studios.
[02:05:58.120 --> 02:06:00.400]   So if you grab a cup of coffee in the cafe,
[02:06:00.400 --> 02:06:02.560]   you're joining, watch me fumble through notes
[02:06:02.560 --> 02:06:05.160]   while trying to maintain my announcer,
[02:06:05.160 --> 02:06:07.920]   very, very competent, knowledgeable,
[02:06:07.920 --> 02:06:10.000]   tech nerd voice one, like, oh, wait a minute.
[02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.440]   I know I got the number here somewhere.
[02:06:12.440 --> 02:06:15.520]   - Brose scroll, you could do it.
[02:06:15.520 --> 02:06:18.680]   - I highlight a very credible Walter Cronkite, actually.
[02:06:18.680 --> 02:06:19.960]   You'd be good at that.
[02:06:19.960 --> 02:06:21.720]   - I think lots of weird words.
[02:06:21.720 --> 02:06:24.800]   - That's the word, thank you, under your not-go.
[02:06:24.800 --> 02:06:28.760]   Renee Richie is at youtube.com/ReneeRitchie.
[02:06:28.760 --> 02:06:33.760]   Anything, so you said you've done all your studio stuff.
[02:06:33.760 --> 02:06:34.600]   - Yeah, what?
[02:06:34.600 --> 02:06:37.880]   - I did full reviews on the studio, on the studio display.
[02:06:37.880 --> 02:06:39.600]   Then I did a follow up on benchmarking
[02:06:39.600 --> 02:06:42.640]   because increasingly benchmarking has become easier
[02:06:42.640 --> 02:06:45.440]   due to prepackaged apps, but harder because of APUs
[02:06:45.440 --> 02:06:48.560]   and SOCs and a lot of what you see, I think thrown around
[02:06:48.560 --> 02:06:50.360]   is what I call benchmark larp,
[02:06:50.360 --> 02:06:51.360]   whereas like you press a button,
[02:06:51.360 --> 02:06:52.960]   but you don't know what it actually means.
[02:06:52.960 --> 02:06:53.800]   We talked about this on the show,
[02:06:53.800 --> 02:06:56.960]   so I did a whole video just explaining why it's really hard
[02:06:56.960 --> 02:07:00.880]   and like, is it hitting a like an E-core or a P-core?
[02:07:00.880 --> 02:07:04.080]   Is it hitting a neural engine or a media engine?
[02:07:04.080 --> 02:07:06.040]   Like just explaining what really goes into
[02:07:06.040 --> 02:07:08.440]   like an in-an-textile review.
[02:07:08.440 --> 02:07:10.400]   So I'm trying to do not just complain,
[02:07:10.400 --> 02:07:12.040]   but provide some better information.

[02:08:57.560 --> 02:09:01.440]   I think we've run through this reel of film.
[02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:03.760]   So before we have to change the cartridge,
[02:09:03.760 --> 02:09:06.200]   I think it's time to say, "Get back to work!"
[02:09:06.200 --> 02:09:07.600]   'Cause break time is over.
[02:09:07.600 --> 02:09:08.520]   Thank you everybody.
