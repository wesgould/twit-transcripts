[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.320]   Andy Inacos here.
[00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.440]   Alex Lindsey's here.
[00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.520]   Jason Snell's here with a binder full of colors because, yes,
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.780]   it's once again time for the six colors.
[00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.920]   Quarterly Results Report.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.380]   Lots of graphs.
[00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.360]   Apple had a very mixed quarter.
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.640]   Is it good news for Apple lovers?
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.760]   That's the question.
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:19.760]   We'll answer.
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.960]   Also coming up a very weird email from Tim Cook that might have
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.520]   gotten Apple in trouble with the Labor Relations Board.
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.400]   And some admissions from the Apple chip designers about why
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.480]   Apple gaming may still take some time.
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.600]   It's all coming up.
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.920]   That and a lot more next on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.400]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.760]   Podcasts you love from people you trust.
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.200]   This is great.
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.680]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.480]   This is Mac Break Weekly, episode 856, recorded Tuesday,
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.000]   February 7, 2023.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.680]   Maybe not.
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.800]   Mac Break Weekly is brought to you by ACI Learning.
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.400]   Tech is one industry where the opportunities outpace growth,
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.360]   especially in cybersecurity.
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.440]   One third of information security jobs
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.760]   require a cybersecurity cert to maintain your competitive edge
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.720]   across audit IT and cybersecurity readiness.
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.800]   Visit go.acilearning.com/twit.

[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.040]   together, finding great care shouldn't take up all your
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.760]   energy.

[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.240]   Thanks for listening to this show.
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.720]   As an ad supported network, we are always looking for new
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.480]   partners with products and services that will benefit our
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.160]   qualified audience.
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.760]   Are you ready to grow your business?
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.720]   Reach out to advertise at twit.tv and launch your campaign
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.480]   now.
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.880]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly to show we cover the latest
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.720]   news from Apple.
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.200]   And thank you, Apple, for keeping your quarterly results,
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.000]   your year end results, for a week where you have nothing
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.960]   else to do because it keeps us.
[00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.000]   There was actually somebody in our Twit forums,
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.440]   a Twit.com community who said, you know, when there's no
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.200]   news, you just shouldn't do a show.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.080]   Last week's show was so boring.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.240]   Just don't do a show.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.680]   And I said, well, we could.
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.960]   But that would break a lot of things.
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.480]   Jason Snell laughing loudly.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.400]   We've always got something going on, right?
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.560]   We can figure something out.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.040]   We find something to talk about.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.200]   Apple results came out.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.320]   We got color graphs, thanks to Mr. Snell.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.200]   We got charts and graphs.
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.480]   Six colors.com.
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.400]   Andy Inako's here.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.320]   GB-H is Andy Inako.
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.960]   He's a bastin fan.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.960]   We got his bastin.
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.000]   Red Sox ad on it.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.440]   Not taking it personally, but not exactly feeling the love
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.240]   from that comment.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:10.640]   I mean, you know, we're Apple/Maxx iPhone/IPAD pals.
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.000]   You like to talk to him every week, but OK, it's fine.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.120]   That's kind of what I said to the guy.
[00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.000]   I said, hey.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.720]   So close to Valentine's Day 2.
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:18.240]   Fine.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.600]   I said, hey, here's an idea.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.800]   We're going to fight on Valentine's Day.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.720]   Here's an idea.
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.000]   If you don't like it, there's the door.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.320]   Also--
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.160]   It was nicer than that.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.760]   Also here, Alex Lindsey from 090.media and officehowers.global.
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.480]   And I owe you a big debt of gratitude.
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.480]   Thank you, Alex, for that.
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.120]   What do I do?
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.680]   Great mid-journey video.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.240]   You get--
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.240]   Oh, was that OK?
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.760]   It was so cool.
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.720]   I've asked Alex--
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.800]   and actually, maybe I guess we could just--
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.720]   we could put it on the show, but you can just watch it.
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.000]   I guess we don't need to add it.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.920]   You can watch it to podcast.
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.160]   You could watch it on Ask the Tech guys from last week.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.800]   And I bet you we turned it into a twit bit, did we?
[00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.560]   Yeah, so make it a twit bit.
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.120]   That way, Alex did about seven minutes
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.560]   on how he uses mid-journey to generate amazing art.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.160]   Seven minutes, 57 seconds.
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.440]   So I guess it's really closer to--
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.880]   Close it, eh?
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.880]   Yeah, I guess.
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:15.840]   Really great bit.
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:16.960]   And thank you for doing that.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:17.440]   Oh, good.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.920]   I know.
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.000]   Behind the scenes, it was a little bit of an arduous journey.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.200]   But well done.
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.120]   Yeah, it was good.
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.800]   It was all good.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.520]   I kept on going, I'll record it one more time.
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.560]   And I was like, OK, I just have to--
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.600]   I have to present it, or they're not going to have it.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.760]   Did you redo it each time?
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:32.440]   Oh, man.
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.040]   I had a tendency to redo things.
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.640]   I know this way.
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.720]   It's why I do a live show.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.720]   It's why I do live shows.
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.520]   And I don't do post shows because, wow,
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.880]   do I get caught up in a cycle.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.960]   Like if I have to do a three minute video,
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.440]   it might take me a week.
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.760]   But I can do two hours a day with no problems.
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.360]   Some writers say that the board processing is the worst thing
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.800]   that happened to writing because now they
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.920]   edit obsessively and never finish.
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.640]   And it's the case with--
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.600]   I'm the same way.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.160]   That's why everything we do is live because I want it live
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.880]   to hard drive or whatever.
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.920]   Yeah, I was thinking about it when I was recording.
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.560]   I was like, this would have been a lot--
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.360]   the original plan was I would just come on early,
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.520]   you and I would talk about it.
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.360]   And then it would be done.
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.200]   Right.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.320]   All right, next time we'll do it.
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.480]   I apologize.
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.800]   No, no, no, no, it was good.
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:15.280]   It was--
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:16.280]   I came out great.
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.200]   I figured out a bunch of things.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.360]   Yeah, no, it's on the Aztecs.
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.720]   The tech I show will be a twippet down the road.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.200]   Thank you for doing that, Alex.
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.280]   I appreciate it.
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.120]   So Apple did put out its earnings,
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.600]   and it seemed like a kind of a mixed bag.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.880]   But I think we have to go to the charts
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.560]   to really understand what happened.
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.000]   Of course, go to the charts.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.440]   Let's go to the charts.
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.400]   Look, those charts don't make themselves.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.200]   I work hard and the chart mines all day.
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.840]   Make those charts.
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.640]   I like the-- I don't know why you chose this as your thumbnail,
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.040]   Jason, but you're looking less--
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.760]   both of you are looking kind of--
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.320]   I don't know, anticipatoryly weird.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.520]   That's the algorithm I was lazy, and I didn't--
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.040]   Oh, you didn't do a thumbnail.
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.720]   So there you go, Jason and Dan Morin from $6.
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:01.240]   That's about right.
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.920]   That's the mood.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.320]   That's your Apple results move this quarter, which is like,
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:11.120]   um, uh, yeah, well, I mean, I think more than ever,
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:14.080]   this is a Rorschach test of how people want to view Apple.
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:15.080]   You know, I do that thing right.
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.480]   It sure felt like that, because some people said,
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.120]   oh, they beat earnings, beat expectations.
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.400]   Oh, it was the worst quarter in 25 years.
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.200]   It was like, I could figure it out.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.840]   I'm amazed.
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.600]   So I watched CNBC, like literally 30 minutes a quarter,
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.320]   and it's the 30 minutes before Apple results come out,
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.840]   because I just am fascinated, because so many people
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.880]   on that-- on financial networks and in financial journalism
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.600]   are kind of like, they're either in a bag for Apple,
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.160]   or they're in the bag against Apple.
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.440]   Like, there's one or the other, and you can see that they're
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.360]   like, no matter what happens, one of them's going to say
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.200]   it's good news, and one of them's going to say it's bad news.
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.040]   That's a pretty good gig.
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.600]   But the truth is, both of these things can be true.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.480]   It-- what revenue was down 8% year over year,
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.000]   which it doesn't happen very often,
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.360]   that Apple's revenue goes down.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.600]   But it was also Apple's second best revenue quarter of all time.
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:59.240]   Yeah.
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:02.160]   So they had a really good quarter in 2022,
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.160]   and that's the problem.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.440]   And so, $117 billion in three months
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:09.040]   seems so bad compared to--
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.200]   $30 billion in profit.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.320]   $30 billion in profit.
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.120]   Oh, and G. Yeah.
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.360]   Again, busting every quarter except the year over year.
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.120]   Except for that.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.120]   So what freaks people out is that, you know,
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.720]   iPhone sales were down 8% and year over year revenue
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:25.840]   was down 5%.
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.720]   The truth is, Apple said they face-- this is the word.
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.440]   They said it 11 times in an hour on their--
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.400]   don't call with analysts.
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.200]   The word headwinds.
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.840]   When you talk about headwinds, you know--
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.680]   Tim Cook even said, like, I had the wind in my face.
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:41.960]   So--
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.400]   Yeah, the macro headwinds were just macro.
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.800]   So the headwinds-- I mean, the best way to look at this
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.320]   is Apple is right on one level.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:54.240]   Like, iPhone sales looked down, but they actually were flat.
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:56.680]   If you look at how many they sold, what was down
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.680]   was revenue in US dollars because of headwinds, which
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.000]   is their code word for foreign exchange.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:03.600]   So basically--
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.120]   Exchange rate.
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:04.760]   --standing--
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:05.240]   Yeah, that's ridiculous.
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.520]   Yeah, if you're standing in China--
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:08.200]   if you're standing in China and you're
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.800]   looking at Chinese currency and you look at how many you sold
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.360]   last year at this time and this year at this time
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.160]   for the holiday quarter, sales were up.
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.320]   But if you converted that number, which they probably
[00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.120]   didn't convert the actual currency,
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:24.480]   but if you converted that number last year to US dollars
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.480]   and converted it this year to US dollars,
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.360]   it looks down because the dollar got stronger.
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.960]   So it's one of those things I don't want to poo poo it
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.560]   because there is softening here.
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:34.760]   There's softening in services.
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.160]   There's softening in wearables.
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:40.720]   There's a bunch of places where this was not a record quarter.
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.960]   And if you're obsessed with growth,
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:44.320]   like Wall Street is for lots of good reasons,
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.320]   you look at it and go, oh, it's a little soft.
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.760]   Are they not growing anymore?
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:49.400]   But I think if you step--
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.600]   take another step back without going off the cliff,
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.640]   you look at and you say, it was tough because they had
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:57.040]   the foreign exchange stuff.
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:02.480]   They're also in year three of the slack period for the iPhone
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:04.920]   because they only really massively update the iPhone
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.120]   every third year.
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.920]   And you can see that there's a cycle that happens over a three
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:10.920]   year period where that new iPhone is a hit.
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.760]   And then everything just kind of like tails off and is flat.
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.880]   And then it comes back when they do a brand new iPhone.
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.120]   So I think--
[00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.040]   I mean, question one that my wife always asked me
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.360]   is, is Apple going to go out of business?
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.400]   My answer is no, they're doing OK.
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.080]   That $30 billion, you can take that to the bank.
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.400]   Or stuff it in the mattress, whatever you want.
[00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:33.000]   And then individually, like the iPhone being flat,
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.800]   they didn't have their factory that
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.280]   made the iPhone Pro for a large period of the quarter.
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:40.920]   So I actually think that it being flat in sales and down
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:44.520]   in currency, basically based on conversions,
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.760]   is the best possible scenario.
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.240]   I thought it would be way worse.
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.280]   And the iPad had literally its best quarter in like nine years.
[00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:53.440]   So there's upside too.
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:54.640]   What does it mark Twain said?
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.240]   There's lies, damn lies, and statistics.
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.440]   And statistics.
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.960]   And when you look, you can--
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.840]   so for instance, two different graphs about services revenue.
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.960]   You look at this graph and you go, wow,
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.880]   I guess services did really well.
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.560]   And then you look at this graph and, oh, I guess
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.960]   it wasn't that good a year.
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.000]   And it just shows you that it really
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.240]   depends on the prism through which you're looking.
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.840]   So let's not focus too much on raw numbers.
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:27.280]   And let's kind of try to give people really the high level
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.360]   top line information that makes a difference.
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.920]   For instance, when I see year over year Mac revenue
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:36.360]   change down 29%, I go, but there's--
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:36.720]   Right.
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.960]   You know, it's not that--
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.280]   Well, the iPad and the Mac both--
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.720]   because the iPad looks great and the Mac looks terrible.
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:47.040]   And the truth is, when you're doing year over year quarter,
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.520]   part of the trick is you got to ask yourself,
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.080]   what happened last year and what happened this year?
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:53.920]   So the iPad, they didn't do an iPad update last year.
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.560]   And in fact, they had a factory shutdown.
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:56.680]   So they couldn't sell as many as--
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:57.440]   So it was pretty flat.
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:57.960]   --demanded.
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.320]   It was a bad year last year.
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.640]   And this year, they came out with the new 10th generation
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:06.040]   iPad and they came out with the new M2 iPad Pro.
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.760]   And they could make as many as people wanted.
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.200]   And so of course, they did well.
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:14.000]   On the Mac side, last year, they came out with the MacBook Pro.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.760]   That was the first Apple Silicon MacBook Pro.
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.680]   And they had it as many as they could sell.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:19.760]   They could sell, right?
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.560]   They could make them that fast.
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:25.400]   This year, they didn't release any Macs in that quarter at all.
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:29.120]   And so is it a surprise that Mac sales were down year over year?
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:29.560]   No.
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:30.640]   Is that the whole story?
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:32.240]   And could there be some softness there?
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:33.320]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:36.280]   But you got to go past that the year over year.
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:39.360]   Because the year over year often is what they always
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:42.880]   call the compare in the jargon of Wall Street.
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:43.880]   It could be a tough compare.
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.360]   It could be a soft and easy compare, basically.
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.520]   And that's what happened with the Mac and the iPad is.
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:50.720]   The Macs sales are not as bad as they look.
[00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:52.720]   And the iPad sales aren't as good as they look.
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.640]   That's the truth of it.
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.240]   So there are a couple of things to note.
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.800]   This is the end of their fiscal year.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:02.000]   So you're going to see those year over year comparisons.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   Normally, you just see quarter to quarter.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.960]   No, this is their first financial quarter.
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.480]   They actually start with the holidays.
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:08.960]   I'm confused.
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:09.320]   OK.
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.480]   These are all just against the year ago quarter.
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:12.680]   So they do this every time?
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:13.360]   The year--
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.360]   Every time, yeah.
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.320]   --every time, you pay attention to this.
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.720]   So they do this every year.
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:17.480]   And the other problem--
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.840]   Because it's so seasonal, you can't compare it sequentially.
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.880]   You have to compare the holidays to the holiday quarters.
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.760]   Rolling averages kind of thing.
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:31.640]   The other thing is, unfortunately, in American economy,
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:35.240]   public companies are held to a quarterly result
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:39.400]   that the market really rewards and punishes them for.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:44.000]   Even though no business operates in a three month cycle,
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.840]   that's still something they have to report.
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.480]   And so we're looking at these three months.
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:49.200]   And they're not--
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:53.520]   I mean, honestly, that's not what's important to Apple.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.840]   So when we're looking at these numbers,
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:57.280]   these are numbers for investors.
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:12:59.160]   These are numbers for the stock market.
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.840]   These are not numbers for us as users.
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.760]   It's hard to read these tea leaves and say,
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:07.080]   oh, Apple's struggling or we're doing well.
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.600]   And then people will say, why does Apple play the game
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.240]   if they don't have to?
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.760]   I mean, why do they have to do that?
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.920]   And a lot of companies look at opportunities
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:16.800]   to not report more than they have to.
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:19.040]   But the problem is, is that an Apple
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:20.320]   is able to bump that up a little bit
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:21.520]   because they do a lot of buybacks.
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:22.440]   They do a lot of dividends.
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.560]   They do things that keep investors happy.
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.000]   And that keeps the stock going up.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.640]   And when we say, well, the investors don't matter.
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.200]   Well, large part of their investors are their employees.
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.880]   You have to remember all those stock options.
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:32.440]   It's a competition.
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:36.720]   And so when your stock is sliding every year,
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:40.080]   employees start looking for the next thing.
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.560]   So you want them to constantly feel like they got in low
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:45.000]   and are going to go out high.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   And so it is more important.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.320]   That's because that's not a contrary to a well run business
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.880]   except it's an important part of a well run business.
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:53.360]   That's public.
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:55.320]   It's why Steve Jobs did not want to go public
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:56.960]   for the longest time, right?
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:57.160]   Yeah.
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.960]   And you're getting the employees though.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.640]   You have to always remember you're getting them
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:01.840]   at somewhat of a discount.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.040]   I mean, they're getting paid a lot of money,
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:05.360]   but they're getting at somewhat of a discount over what
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.680]   they're not going to get rate because they're getting stock.
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.360]   Steve always, Steve said, I don't want to go public.
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.000]   I don't want to have a stock because I don't want employees
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.640]   to be sitting there all day looking at their net worth.
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:21.080]   And I understand that having at one point had had some shares.
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:23.720]   And you do some, you know, it's not unusual to go down
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:25.480]   the halls in Silicon Valley and see people
[00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:28.680]   with little stock tickers on their screen.
[00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.480]   Especially as it goes, if it does something, you know,
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:33.160]   if you see the news that, oh, you drop by 12%,
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.320]   that's something that hurts when you're,
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:36.720]   if you had a lot of stock, you know.
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:38.440]   But it's all paper, right?
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:40.080]   It's all paper.
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:45.080]   So iPhone quarterly revenue went up as a percentage
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.280]   of total revenue.
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.040]   It was going down closer to half.
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:52.200]   It's now 56% big part of their revenue.
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.320]   Holiday quarter, right?
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:56.840]   Like it's surprising how seasonal even the iPhone is,
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.880]   but it really is there a lot.
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.160]   It comes out in the fall and then there's also holiday buying.
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.800]   And that's why it hurt them, I think, so much to have that thing
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.280]   that we talked about when they announced it.
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:09.080]   They weren't that they weren't the factory that makes
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.960]   their most important segment of their most important product
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:14.200]   shut down and they couldn't fulfill demand.
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:17.720]   And the mystery question is, of course,
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:20.000]   what happened to those people, right?
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.400]   Did they buy an iPhone, a cheaper iPhone?
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.920]   Did they wait or did they go and buy a different phone?
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.280]   Or did they say, I'm just not going to upgrade this year?
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:31.200]   Because there's no way to really measure like lost sales.
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.360]   I think some of them will just roll into the next quarter
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:36.040]   and Apple will benefit from that,
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:37.280]   but not all of them, right?
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:39.320]   And you always want to just sell it.
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.040]   If somebody wants to buy your product,
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:45.160]   ideally you should have it ready to sell and they didn't.
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:46.760]   Or the next year.
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:49.480]   A lot of times people make a decision now that Apple is
[00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:53.800]   in this kind of constant pattern of being able to have,
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.040]   you know, this September.
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:57.160]   So if you look at it, you go, that wasn't that much
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.560]   different than my last phone or the phone that I have.
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:02.040]   I don't see any new features, then you're oftentimes not
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.960]   waiting for a quarter, you're just waiting for the next year.
[00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:06.160]   You're like, I'm going to keep this phone, the smart people.
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.520]   I mean, like you either buy it, like make a decision,
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:13.520]   buy it in October, enjoy the glow of the year.
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:16.880]   And then, or you just wait until the next year,
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:19.120]   unless you break it, you know, or something like that.
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:23.680]   - That's why rumors of iPhone Ultra coming out this year
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:28.160]   next are so interesting because you really have to provoke
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.240]   an iPhone user to upgrade at this point.
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:33.600]   You have to give them something that is so radically different
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.520]   from what's in their pocket right now,
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:39.960]   that it really does push them to upgrade.
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:43.040]   It used to be that people were kind of on a two year
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.240]   or even a three year upgrade cycle.
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.280]   Now I'm seeing more and more people that look so long as,
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.920]   so long as my phone is still working,
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.600]   so long as it's, I haven't dropped into the toilet yet.
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:56.880]   I'm not going to replace this until it actually breaks.
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:59.600]   It's hard to advise people on,
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.840]   do you have a working phone?
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:01.760]   Yes, are you happy with it?
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:03.640]   Yes, okay, then don't worry about,
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:06.120]   don't worry about upgrading right now.
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:08.600]   Services were good.
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:11.080]   That's not seasonal, right?
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:13.160]   Services is a year, I mean, that's one of the reasons
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.520]   Apple likes it, right?
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:15.360]   - Right, right.
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:18.240]   I mean, they would say that because they don't adjust
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:20.440]   the year monthly fee with currency,
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:22.480]   that they got hit hard by currency here,
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.000]   I think the truth with services is,
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.800]   they used to have explosive growth there
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:29.240]   and it's still growing every quarter,
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:31.760]   but it's not growing as fast as it used to.
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:35.280]   And that's a question of like, what else do they have, right?
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.000]   Like obviously it's a focus for them,
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.800]   so what other services, what other methods do they have
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.640]   of getting more revenue out of everybody?
[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:45.160]   They boasted about the fact that there were two billion
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:48.280]   activations basically, it's two billion active users
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:51.400]   of devices, Apple devices that are currently being used.
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:54.080]   - That's Mac, iPad and iPhone all together.
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:56.040]   - Yeah, it's everything put together
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:58.400]   and that yeah, and that does mean it's double counting,
[00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:00.200]   but the point there that they're trying to make
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:03.480]   to the Wall Street types is ecosystem.
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:06.120]   And services was where you see it most directly,
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:09.920]   which is if you have two billion devices in use,
[00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.880]   that's two billion devices that you can sell
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.640]   add-on services to.
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.840]   And we have discussed and we'll discuss
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:18.760]   for probably add-in for an item,
[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:21.800]   the wisdom of Apple pivoting so hard into services,
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:25.080]   but if you're looking just at the services line,
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.560]   like that's always gonna be the question is,
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:30.080]   are you growing your existing services
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.760]   and do you have new services that are coming along
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:34.480]   that you can add to the pot in order to keep
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:35.320]   that number bubbling?
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:36.800]   'Cause Wall Street loves that number
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.560]   'cause it just keeps growing.
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:40.360]   - Yeah, especially because when you compare it
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:42.840]   to companies like particularly Google,
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:44.560]   where they're still dealing with the fact
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:47.120]   that they're making about 82%,
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:49.040]   I'm remembering from last week's call,
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:52.320]   82% of their revenue from digital advertising,
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.160]   that is a lot of money to be making
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:56.920]   from one extremely, particularly for Google,
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.840]   extremely volatile revenue source.
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.320]   So actually seeing that wedge of the pie
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.120]   for iPhone gets smaller and smaller
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:06.640]   is one of the best things that anybody,
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:09.600]   who is concerned about the health of Apple could ever see
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:13.200]   because sales of iPhones is kind of the only thing
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:16.440]   that Apple is doing, or sales of hardware rather,
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:19.000]   that is bulletproof from new regulation,
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   from government orders that you're gonna have
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.360]   to break up this part of your business,
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:26.480]   that you're making too much money
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.280]   from this part of the segment.
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:30.200]   It's a really, really good sign that you like to see
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.520]   if you're a fan of Apple.
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.520]   - And I think overall what you wanna keep
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.280]   on looking at that graph is just how more,
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:39.000]   they're obviously working at making it more and more even.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.880]   So it's not just services of the phone,
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.760]   but how do we just keep building each one of these
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.200]   so that they start looking like all smaller,
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.920]   equal parts of the pie,
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:51.080]   and that's just really just prudent business to do that.
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:52.200]   And it's really hard to do,
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.880]   and you can see that Google has a hard time doing it.
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.480]   They try, they make lots of new things,
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:01.480]   but if you've ever been to a Google ad event,
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:03.360]   you know who has old one.
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.520]   It's like who base for everything.
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:09.320]   So yeah, Google's still out, and Google,
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:12.600]   it's an incredible, I mean, until they get regulated,
[00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:16.120]   it's an incredible model, but regulation is,
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:19.360]   and we saw what ATT did to other companies
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.840]   that have been highly dependent on one thing,
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:25.200]   is it really, really slammed them harder
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.760]   than I think most people think.
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:30.760]   - Yeah, particularly, I mean, Google is under,
[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:34.560]   is under two really, really big DOJ lawsuits.
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:36.320]   The thing on search is probably not gonna amount
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.320]   to anything, but oh boy,
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:41.880]   if you've read the complaint that the government has
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:46.560]   against Google for their anti-competitive antitrust
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.280]   violations on their ad business,
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.160]   it is like a laundry list of if you want to become
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:54.320]   the most anti-trust, violating company in the world,
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.240]   do these eight things in a row,
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:58.640]   and the government documented, well, I'll be darned,
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:00.080]   they've done all eight of these things,
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:02.120]   really, really emphatically well.
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:05.240]   So yeah, you don't want that 82% of your business
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:07.520]   coming from a business that you are probably going
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:10.240]   to get handcuffed for very, very soon.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.120]   - Would they like the profit line to be
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.120]   a nice, smooth curve up?
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:15.320]   They probably would.
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:20.320]   It's so, I mean, okay, so they made $10 billion a month
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:24.040]   instead of $12 billion a month.
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:25.720]   - You know, they're doing fine, kids.
[00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:26.560]   They're doing just--
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:30.320]   - This is why so many of these reports are so,
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:33.160]   like the gloom and doom that Jason talked about
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.440]   by the analysts before the reports come out.
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:37.160]   We are talking, we're not talking about,
[00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:40.400]   oh, they lost money this quarter,
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.200]   or oh my goodness, they're trending downwards,
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:44.640]   like no, the rate at which they're making
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:47.080]   an ungodly amount of money is slowing down.
[00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:49.000]   They're still making an ungodly amount of money,
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.840]   but they thought that they would be
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:53.000]   an otherworldly, godly amount of money
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.840]   by this quarter, unfortunately,
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:56.440]   it was only a ungodly.
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:59.080]   It's like, oh my goodness, why are we worried?
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.040]   Why are we considering this as a downturn?
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:03.000]   Why are we dumping the stock based on the fact
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.880]   that they're still making, they still have the ability
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:10.000]   to basically thumb their nose at almost any
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.560]   one government's ability to control or limit their power
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.240]   upon a terrified populace?
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:18.440]   - And yet put yourself in the mindset of investors.
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:19.720]   It's been such a great ride.
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.480]   They're always looking over their shoulder going,
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:23.840]   when is this gonna end?
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:27.040]   I mean, no company is on top forever,
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:29.000]   but I don't see an end in sight.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.560]   - I think a great education that I had
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:33.200]   about how Wall Street works, right?
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:34.640]   'Cause there's always, there's a great result,
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:35.640]   and then the stock goes down,
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:37.560]   and you're like, wait a second, isn't the stock price
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:39.040]   a reward for your announcement?
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.280]   And the answer is no, the stock price
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:41.520]   is a futures market, right?
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:43.400]   It is what happens next.
[00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:47.160]   And if you make a huge amount of money,
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:49.800]   but you don't meet the expectations of the market,
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:50.880]   your stock will go down
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:52.880]   because they thought you'd do better than you did.
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:53.920]   Is that fair?
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:55.880]   Well, no, but it's not a measure of how you're doing.
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:57.120]   - It's built into the price.
[00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.200]   - What's the future?
[00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:01.240]   I find some of these Apple Bears on CNBC and other places
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:04.800]   amusing because they seem, I don't know what their game is,
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:05.840]   I don't know what their plan is.
[00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.640]   Maybe they're just like, one of these days,
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:11.280]   Apple's gonna step in it, but like the iPhone,
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:12.800]   and now we see with services,
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:15.160]   the ability of Apple to create this ecosystem
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:17.440]   where people who buy an iPhone
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:19.960]   make just keep paying the money over time,
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.640]   plus keep buying iPhones.
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:24.920]   That is such, it is, I said on that video
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:28.600]   that I did with Dan, it is a machine that makes money.
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:29.440]   That's what it is.
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.600]   It is an enormous machine that makes money.
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:36.040]   And when you make $30 billion of profit in a quarter
[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:38.800]   in three months, like you're doing okay.
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:42.000]   We can argue about the fringes and the details.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.960]   And, but even if the iPhone was a decaying product,
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:46.000]   which I don't think it is,
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.200]   I think it's at the end of this sort of cycle
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:49.960]   where the latest iPhones were kind of sleepy
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:51.760]   because they were like the last two iPhones
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.120]   and we're about to enter a cycle
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:54.600]   where they'll probably be new iPhones
[00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:56.160]   and those sales will surge again.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:58.200]   But like the bottom line is the iPhone alone,
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:00.440]   let alone the iPad and the Mac,
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:02.600]   combined with the services revenue,
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.320]   that is just the gift that keeps on giving.
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:06.720]   And, you know, I think Apple's got so much momentum.
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:08.800]   Now I'm sounding like one of those people on CNBC.
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:10.680]   I think they got so much momentum, Leo.
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:12.240]   They could just keep going and going and going.
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:14.840]   But it's true, the iPhone is that successful
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:17.400]   and that powerful that Apple,
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.400]   Apple has learned how to harness that power
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:22.600]   and make even more money from it than they used to.
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.000]   - And the services, of course,
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.320]   bring you back to lock you further into the hardware.
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.560]   'Cause you're, all of these things you're doing
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:32.320]   and it becomes, you know, just something that you can't,
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.640]   you know, it just gets harder and harder to think about.
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:38.520]   Like I think about, I have an Android phone and I use it,
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:40.280]   but when I open it up, it doesn't have any of the services
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:41.760]   that I'm used to having.
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:44.920]   - I just bought the new S23 so I can take a look at it.
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:49.400]   And yeah, I mean, it can't be a daily driver for me
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.640]   because by this, and this is sad
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:52.880]   'cause I'd like it to be,
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:55.080]   but I'm so locked into Apple's stuff.
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:58.900]   I can't abandon it and that's worked quite well for them.
[00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:07.400]   I mean, is there, you know, you could look at Google
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:11.360]   and say, well, there's looming threats
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:13.320]   from government regulation
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:17.400]   and from, you know, Microsoft's and chat GPT,
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:21.280]   making Bing be an AI version of Google
[00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:23.480]   and you can talk about threats.
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:27.080]   - Facebook, good Lord, nothing but.
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:29.700]   Are there any threats to Apple's hegemony?
[00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:32.720]   - Long-term, sure.
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.960]   I mean, that's why there's been so much money.
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:37.360]   That's why there's been so much money on VR and AR
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:38.200]   and stuff like that. - I understand.
[00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:39.040]   They want the next thing,
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:41.960]   but what's gonna, is do people think
[00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:44.640]   they will stop having phones?
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.000]   - I think that's the, I mean, honestly,
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.400]   I think that's what the VR AR thing is,
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:49.560]   the hedge against what would replace the iPhone
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:51.160]   'cause I think even Apple understands
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:53.600]   that as long as they keep doing a decent job with the iPhone,
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:56.160]   that this will keep going forever
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:57.560]   until there's a replacement of the iPhone.
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:59.400]   - Until there's something besides the phone.
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:00.440]   And what would that be?
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:02.720]   I mean, we don't, I don't think we have the technology.
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.280]   I think that's what Apple's realizing is
[00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:06.120]   we don't have the technology to make something
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:06.960]   to replace the phone.
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:07.800]   - 20 years from now.
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:10.600]   - Well, but the problem is that doing AR and VR
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:12.920]   is really, really hard and it takes billions and billions
[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:14.760]   of dollars to do. - So you guys start now.
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:16.760]   - And if you see your behind, you're done.
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:18.320]   You know, and what Apple needs to do is,
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.120]   I mean, that's why Microsoft got into HoloLens.
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:21.840]   That's why Oculus-- - But here's the good news.
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:23.000]   There's a very good news. - All these companies
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:23.840]   are dumping it.
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.840]   Right? - Yeah.
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:27.320]   - Microsoft's getting out of the business.
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:30.640]   Well, well, no, Microsoft actually released something
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:32.160]   saying to correct that, saying,
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:35.120]   "Oh, no, no, no, here's our commitment to HoloLens."
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.960]   Facebook men have also had something posting saying
[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:39.840]   that here's why we're still committed to this.
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:42.840]   - I think you'll-- - I think I don't buy it for a minute.
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:46.040]   - They lost 13-- - They lost 13,
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:49.800]   Meta lost $13 billion on this last year,
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.400]   10 billion the year before.
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:56.400]   You can't lose tens of billions of dollars every year forever.
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:01.880]   - Unless if you have a crazy CEO who is unstoppable
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:05.360]   and has not been thrown out by the stockholders
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:07.200]   or their board yet, yeah.
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:09.840]   I think that if you so long as he's still thinks
[00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:12.560]   he's committed this, he will still keep those purse strings open.
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:14.320]   And because he has founder money,
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:18.840]   like not just founder money, he has like the 1990s style of,
[00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:21.360]   we founded this company so that it's almost impossible
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:24.440]   to kick out a founder without his--
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:27.920]   - Yeah, but he's scrambling because to be honest,
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:30.800]   Meta is challenged on a lot of areas.
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:32.200]   I mean-- - Oh, I agree.
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:33.520]   - I agree. - And so that, you know,
[00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:34.840]   as long as it's like Google,
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:38.040]   they've got the money machine with search advertising
[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:40.200]   so they can kind of try stuff.
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:43.720]   And Meta's got this, you know, the blue page, the Facebook,
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.480]   but that's kind of starting to look a little--
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:48.040]   You could see why Meta's running as fast as they can.
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:49.840]   Meanwhile, Microsoft's saying,
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:51.720]   "Yeah, maybe this'll take off, maybe not."
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:52.600]   You know what's the good news?
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.840]   Microsoft says, "No matter who makes it,
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.200]   they're gonna have to run on Azure."
[00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:59.320]   So let's really make our cloud be strong
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:03.000]   and then we will provide services to whoever ends up being
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.560]   the AR/VR Metaverse winner.
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:10.400]   Apple is saying, "Well, the iPhone someday is gonna be
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:12.160]   replaced by something.
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:14.480]   I guess it's gotta be something you wear,
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:18.000]   what else could it be, or an implant, a brain implant."
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.800]   - Or if it's on your wrist,
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:23.200]   they're headed down that path.
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.040]   - Yeah, they've got that.
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:25.520]   - In your ears, they got it.
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:27.280]   If it's on your eyes, they're working on it.
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:28.120]   - No, they're working on wearables.
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:29.600]   - They're working on wearables, yeah.
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:32.320]   - But it is interesting that Apple is still
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:35.200]   healing to their roots where every single big project
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:39.160]   they've got going that we're tracking,
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:42.160]   it's still all about creating consumer appealing hardware.
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:45.840]   It's still about, let's buy this piece of hardware for AR/VR.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.080]   Hey, let's buy this car.
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:49.880]   The services are doing great.
[00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:52.160]   The app store is doing great to see.
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:56.840]   It is the only area in which Apple will probably get spanked
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:58.520]   pretty hard by international regulators,
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:00.720]   but it's not necessarily what the whole company
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:01.720]   is hinged on.
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:04.240]   Meanwhile, Google stays close to their roots.
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:06.560]   Microsoft stays close to their roots as we are,
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.800]   they are both companies that sling bits around.
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.640]   The fact that they're slinging bits on servers
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.920]   instead of on floppies is almost immaterial
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:15.840]   because they are, whatever apparatus that they created
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:17.200]   for themselves that they've been running on
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.520]   for the past two decades, they can continue to run
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:22.680]   on that same apparatus because they're still writing software.
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:26.280]   Facebook, however, they are gonna get spanked so hard
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:28.640]   because they have to turn, they have to be a cookie company
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:31.080]   that starts making diesel lubricants.
[00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:33.000]   I mean, how do you do that?
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   (laughing)
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.440]   - Yeah, I mean, use that on the cookie sheet.
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:36.680]   So, that will be good.
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:41.680]   - Well, and again, I still think that Mark read
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:44.840]   Ready Player One and then just was like,
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:46.160]   - Let's do it, man, we're gonna do it.
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:48.000]   - That's gonna be great, I can't wait.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.800]   - But I think that was a driver of understanding
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:53.600]   that social networks could all be virtual
[00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.040]   and do all those things.
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:58.240]   The big thing though is that if no one's cracked it,
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:59.600]   no one's cracked, and so you can say,
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.360]   well, no one's going to crack it,
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:02.760]   but that's a pretty big bet.
[00:30:02.760 --> 00:30:04.080]   No one's going to crack this phone.
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:06.840]   - No, somebody will crack it, but it's distant.
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:10.080]   And as Apple has learned, it's not gonna be next year.
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:13.840]   - But you can't do is just flip a switch, right?
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:14.840]   - Right, so it's--
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:16.760]   - Apple's investing because they know
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:18.160]   that if they aren't pushing it forward,
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:20.200]   first off, it'll take longer to happen, probably.
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:22.160]   And second, it'll be too late for them to catch up,
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.960]   and they don't want to have--
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:24.800]   - No, I swear.
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:26.320]   - Right, they wanna build the iPhone's replacement
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:27.240]   if it's gonna happen.
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:28.080]   And if it doesn't happen--
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:29.080]   - Do it while you catch low.
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:31.000]   - They're gonna say, it's worth it as a head.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.360]   - They're still, they're developing thousands of patents
[00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:35.760]   that they've developed just--
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:37.400]   - That's true, the major's donut is probably.
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:38.240]   - Yeah, the major's donut is what they--
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:39.520]   - It's not like they're losing money.
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:40.600]   I mean, they're printing money.
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:42.160]   And so this is the time that you,
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.160]   the smart companies, the time you do this,
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:46.880]   you look at some aggressive projects that only you can do,
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:50.040]   they are uniquely positioned because they make the chips.
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:53.320]   So the M1, M2, M3 chips, because they make those,
[00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:56.880]   because they make the development platform,
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:00.360]   they are better positioned than anyone else to do the ARBR
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:02.160]   if someone pulls it off.
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:05.720]   And the big thing is, is that if Apple does somehow
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:08.400]   come out and then, you know, the first one will be
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:11.720]   a developer version of things and it'll be whatever it is,
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:14.640]   if Apple pulls this off and they start going down the field,
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:16.240]   the chances of anyone else catching up
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.600]   will be the same that they're catching up to the iPhone.
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:20.480]   It's not impossible and Android's done a good job
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:22.160]   at being able to even the market out,
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:23.400]   but it won't be very many people.
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:25.600]   Because now you're behind a company--
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:26.440]   - Oh, I agree.
[00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:29.360]   - And that's what I'm saying is it's interesting to watch
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:32.440]   these other people who were invested in it fall by the way.
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:35.440]   So Google had Google Glass, they had Cardboard,
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:36.640]   they were all in.
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:37.920]   - You know, Glass is still out.
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:39.240]   - It's still, no, come on.
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:40.080]   - It's not public.
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:42.560]   - They learned that it's not, it's so unfair.
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:43.440]   - It's still in a lot of units.
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:44.440]   - Let's be fair.
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:45.280]   - I'm a little bit.
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:48.480]   - And then, and even Microsoft's, regardless of their statements,
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:50.080]   they fired most of the people.
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:52.480]   It's going away.
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:53.320]   Who's another threat?
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:56.920]   - Meta, well, I wouldn't worry too much about meta either.
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:32:00.960]   I think Apple, I agree with you, Alex.
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:03.080]   Apple's in the best position.
[00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:06.760]   And I think they're almost alone at the head of the pack
[00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:07.600]   at this point.
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:08.440]   Meta's the only-- - Yeah, I mean,
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:10.160]   it's only-- - Look at magic.
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:12.040]   Whatever happened to them?
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:13.400]   - Apple.
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:15.040]   - Like people heard about what Apple,
[00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:16.240]   people heard of what Apple was doing
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:17.960]   and they were like, I don't think that magic leave can make--
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:18.960]   I think everyone thought that Apple
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:21.520]   was gonna come out a lot earlier than it did.
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:23.040]   But there were a lot of people that got real excited
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:25.040]   and then were afraid that Apple's gonna come out next year
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:28.120]   with something and just were spooked.
[00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:31.640]   - Yeah, well, also let's give Apple credit for something else.
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:35.920]   Any enterprise like this is gonna require full on support
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:36.760]   from developers.
[00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:39.920]   They can, hardware proposes, software disposes.
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:44.080]   And Apple has, I think, more than any other major company
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:48.920]   has created a lot of credit and trust with developers
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:52.560]   that if we promote this as here's a development platform,
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:55.120]   here's something that we want you to develop for.
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:57.320]   Developers have a lot, can have a lot of faith
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:59.520]   that Apple is invested in this themselves.
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:01.800]   They are going to stick with this for years and years
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:05.320]   because they believe in it until it actually gets all spun up.
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:08.160]   Whereas almost any other company, Google, especially,
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:12.560]   this is just something that they're gonna be into for this year
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:15.040]   until the, again, the economic head wins
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:17.200]   for the macroeconomic, whatever change,
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:19.880]   or they had this other idea that replaces it.
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:22.800]   It's almost a fool's errand to try to support anything
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:25.800]   that Google proposes for developers.
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:27.880]   - Well, Google's ADD is killing them
[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:29.880]   and now it's all about AI.
[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:32.520]   And so everybody just went, you know,
[00:33:32.520 --> 00:33:35.440]   it's that meme where the guy's walking this girlfriend
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:38.280]   and he's looking over his shoulder at the, you know,
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:39.960]   the AI coming up behind and going,
[00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:41.840]   "Oh, that's better than VR."
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:43.880]   They're all distracted now.
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:47.560]   This is smart, Apple should just stay the course.
[00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:49.360]   - And there's a couple things that Apple, again,
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:51.520]   has that the other teams don't have
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:52.440]   that are working on this.
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:55.120]   And one is that because they own that whole stack,
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:56.840]   everything from the hardware all the way through,
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:00.080]   their ability to make everything work, you know, through that.
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:01.880]   And we're not seeing something,
[00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:02.760]   but they're gonna release something
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:04.400]   and hope someone develops for it.
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:05.600]   Apple is building the tools,
[00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:08.560]   have been announcing the tools,
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:11.560]   rolling the tools out for five or six years now.
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:12.800]   You know, so these are like,
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:13.960]   I think it was, it might even be more,
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:15.680]   it might be seven years now
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:17.880]   that they've been rolling out USDZ
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:20.080]   and rolling out tools that make that easier
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:21.960]   and rolling out, pieces that make that easier
[00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:24.400]   and, you know, slowly incorporating into other things.
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:27.600]   And so that's something that the other teams just don't have.
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:29.760]   The other thing is, is I really feel like after,
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:32.200]   you know, I've used all of the platforms
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:36.480]   and the thing that I have liked the least is the interface.
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:40.640]   The human machine interface for all of the goggles,
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:42.600]   every version of goggles that I've put on
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:44.840]   and I've put on most of them,
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:47.840]   most of the commercial ones and some that aren't commercial.
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:49.760]   And they're all funky when you put them on,
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.680]   like how do you get them started and where do you go
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:54.160]   and this interface is stupid and why am I doing this?
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:56.280]   You know, like, and trying to explain to somebody else,
[00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:58.120]   like I can never pick up my goggles,
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:00.600]   pick up whatever I'm using, an oculus, a hollow lens
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:01.640]   or whatever, I just handed to someone's,
[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:03.040]   I put this on into work.
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:03.880]   Like it's always like, put it on,
[00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:04.880]   now you gotta tap the thing
[00:35:04.880 --> 00:35:06.400]   and now you gotta move the thing over here
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:07.800]   and now you gotta, you know,
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:09.840]   and people get lost and you're like, oh, nevermind.
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:10.680]   You know, and-
[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:12.760]   - Yeah, because you can't see the can't see.
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:13.960]   - I can't see what's going on.
[00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:14.800]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.360]   I can't see, you know, it's just so frustrating.
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:18.240]   You don't wanna, you know, and-
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:19.840]   - Not to mention, there are some other,
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:22.920]   I think there's some other larger issues.
[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:25.760]   There's battery life, there's size.
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:26.920]   - High glasses.
[00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:29.560]   - You know, and then there's also the issue of moving.
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:32.360]   There's no really good way,
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:34.440]   you can't just walk forward in VR.
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:36.200]   There's not really a good way to move.
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:39.520]   And the way they solve it in Ready Player One
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:42.440]   with the treadmill that goes in every direction.
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:44.720]   I think that's an on starter.
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:46.400]   So there's, I just think there's,
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.600]   I'm not saying intractable,
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:51.000]   but there are definitely massive challenges with VR.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.800]   Is it like going to Casino?
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:55.640]   Do you think for Tim Cook, he's looking at, you know,
[00:35:55.640 --> 00:35:57.480]   he's looking at the roulette table
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:59.320]   and there's a lot of bets on there.
[00:35:59.320 --> 00:36:01.480]   I'm sure he's doing, you know, the due diligence
[00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:05.160]   and he's got committees working on strategic planning,
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:06.240]   you know, and all of that.
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:07.760]   - I don't know, I gotta feel like he's in the roulette.
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:11.160]   We'll just going 12, 12, 12, 12.
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:12.000]   - Let's stay on the-
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.640]   - Like, you know, like if I just stay on that,
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:18.000]   'cause I don't know, this is doing this for a decade
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.520]   and building things around it.
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:20.880]   - You gotta be a lot of hedging.
[00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:22.320]   You've got a lot of patience.
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:23.160]   - See, that's it.
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:25.920]   I wish Tim Cook was so exciting that he was a roulette player,
[00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:28.560]   but I think calling it hedging your bets,
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:30.640]   calling it something like what they do
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:32.960]   with like one of the reasons they try to avoid
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:35.440]   all of these financial headwinds
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:37.400]   is they do financial hedging
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:39.360]   where they'll like buy currency in one
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:41.840]   and so that if the dollar's too strong
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:43.600]   then they've got currency in the other way and they do that.
[00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:44.760]   And that's what this is, right?
[00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:47.360]   I think ultimately what you say it's a bet
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:49.400]   or spin at the roulette wheel or a hedge or whatever,
[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:51.280]   what they're really trying to do is say
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:53.600]   what are the places where we have opportunity
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:55.520]   and there's opportunity for it to kill us.
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:59.200]   And that is why the VR AR project exists,
[00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:01.440]   is that it's an opportunity to replace the iPhone
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:03.520]   and if anybody's gonna do that, it better be us.
[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.840]   And honestly, I think that's why they've been
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:09.480]   dealing around with the car all this time too,
[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:12.360]   is I think they think that there's an opportunity there
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:13.960]   or at least they thought at some point
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:15.720]   an opportunity there for them to redefine
[00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:17.760]   the automotive market with their technology
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:19.720]   and that it was worth placing that bet.
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:21.240]   And they have the money for it, right?
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:22.960]   So I think you-- - Yeah, they're the chip leader.
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:25.240]   So they can make some bets, yeah.
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:28.240]   I would love to be a fly on the wall.
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:30.840]   Do you think he has like a game of Thrones room
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:34.120]   where the whole map is laid out and he's got like,
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:38.320]   or do you think he's got a wall with strings attached by taxes?
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:41.320]   - No, I like to think he's got like one of those,
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:43.200]   like one of those old French kings
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.040]   would have that human chessboard.
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:47.720]   And so he has like employees dressed as the car
[00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:49.440]   with a little cardboard car.
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:50.800]   - I want to have one of those.
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:54.840]   - There's creepy a rakes where he pushes the cars forward.
[00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:57.640]   And I mean, it must be fascinating to watch
[00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:01.280]   at this level with this much, what's their cash position?
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:03.560]   Did they say, is it 120 billion?
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:07.480]   - I forget, they have many, many tens of billions, if not--
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:10.160]   - They repatriated it, which means they can spend it now
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:11.480]   in the US.
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:14.600]   They've, I mean, I would love to be a fly in the wall
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:17.560]   because in some ways it's worse to have more money.
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:19.160]   It's worse to have more resources
[00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:21.320]   because you don't have to be as careful.
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:24.520]   But I think my sense of Apple management, Tim Cook,
[00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:27.280]   especially is that they are fairly thoughtful
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:30.800]   about-- - 165, $165 billion.
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:33.000]   - And notice they aren't going out like Meta and Google
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.680]   and buying every company they can.
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:39.120]   They're very thoughtful and methodical
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:40.200]   in how they pursue this.
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:42.720]   - And they usually buy small because they wanted
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:43.560]   the culture to--
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:46.120]   - Yeah, they don't want to have a big culture clash.
[00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:47.560]   They don't want time Warner.
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:52.160]   It's really fun to watch and it's interesting to watch.
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:54.160]   And I'm glad I'm not an investor in tech stocks
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:59.160]   because it's concerning, you know, I mentioned this before.
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:02.360]   Philip Elmer DeWitt asked me to talk to his group
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:06.080]   of subscribers for his website, PED 3.0.
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:07.680]   And I didn't understand at the time
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:10.000]   that they're all Apple investors,
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.360]   that the people who subscribe to his stuff
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:14.920]   are Apple investors trying to see what the next big thing is.
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:17.040]   And I went in there saying, "Ah, Apple."
[00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:19.440]   (laughing)
[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:20.720]   Talk about headwinds.
[00:39:20.720 --> 00:39:26.560]   Anyway, it's hard to bet against Apple these days.
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:29.160]   And I'm glad I don't have to think about that, you know?
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:33.520]   But it feels like, I mean, look at this pie chart.
[00:39:33.520 --> 00:39:34.440]   This is interesting.
[00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:37.640]   This is the quarterly revenue by category.
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:42.000]   Two of these didn't exist.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.160]   Wearables and services didn't exist five or 10 years ago.
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:48.560]   It was iPhone, Mac, and iPad.
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:50.600]   And now more than a quarter their revenue
[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:53.400]   is coming from these new sources, 30%
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:57.680]   from these new sources that were just invented
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:59.400]   out of whole cloths.
[00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:01.400]   Because, and that's what we have to kind of look back.
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:02.600]   That was 10 years ago, they said,
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:03.880]   "Maybe we should do a watch.
[00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:04.920]   Maybe we should have a HomePod.
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:07.120]   Maybe we, you know, maybe we should have some more peripherals.
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:09.680]   Maybe we should have Apple One.
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:11.640]   Maybe we should start Apple TV Plus.
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:13.080]   All of those things were the things
[00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:15.000]   that they've been doing for the last 10 years.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   And it's paid off.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.320]   It's absolutely paid off.
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:19.160]   So--
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:21.040]   - Yeah, the App Store is in there too, don't forget.
[00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:22.880]   - Yeah, well, same thing, right?
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:25.240]   - All their cuts from the App Store and App Store subscriptions.
[00:40:25.240 --> 00:40:26.160]   But yeah, you're right.
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:28.460]   This is, I mean, where Apple's open
[00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:29.960]   in accessories used to be called, Other,
[00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:32.080]   but all it was was like, you know, track balls.
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:32.920]   - Remember?
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:33.760]   - I don't know.
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:35.480]   - Remember, they were, you know, 20 years ago,
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:38.800]   this green slice called Mac was it.
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:41.720]   That was the whole kitten kaboodle.
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:44.440]   So, at least if you look from history,
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:46.040]   point of view, historic point of view,
[00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:49.760]   they've done really, really the right thing all along.
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:51.480]   Of course, they were pretty lucky with the iPhone,
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:55.000]   lucky or smart, but the iPhone really,
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.320]   there's been nothing like that in technology.
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:00.080]   I mean, you can't think of a single product
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:03.240]   that changed the world like the iPhone has.
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:05.400]   - Right, and it's hard to, and because they're singular,
[00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:08.120]   because it's Apple with the iPhone and Apple owns the iPhone,
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:10.160]   like, I don't know if I want to predict,
[00:41:10.160 --> 00:41:11.920]   I mean, probably you could predict that Samsung
[00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:13.520]   will be selling lots and lots of smartphones
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:16.720]   in 10 or 15 years, but really what I do know
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:19.160]   is that in 10 or 15 years, there'll be lots of iPhones
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:21.080]   being sold and there'll be lots of Android phones
[00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:22.720]   being sold, whoever the brand is.
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:25.120]   And like, lots of iPhones being sold.
[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:26.920]   There are three billion Android phones,
[00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:30.160]   but there are a lot of those are $50 crap phones.
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:31.960]   - Right, and the fortunes could rise and fall.
[00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:33.280]   I think Android's not going anywhere,
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:34.520]   but the fortunes could rise and fall.
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:36.720]   I think iPhone, like Android, is not gonna go anywhere
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:38.640]   and there's only one source for iPhones.
[00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:41.000]   - Yeah, look at how hard it's been for Google
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.160]   to gain any traction at all in Android.
[00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:45.560]   And they own the operating system.
[00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:46.600]   - And they make good phones.
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:49.080]   - And they make really good phones and no traction at all.
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:51.080]   Samsung completely dominates.
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:53.800]   - Yeah, it's very interesting.
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:56.840]   - Yeah, 'cause it's hard to compete with a company
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:59.400]   that is the manufacturing company.
[00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:01.840]   That's all they do is manufacture things.
[00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:03.160]   They manufacture components.
[00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:04.160]   They know how to assemble them.
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:05.000]   They know how to ship them.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.840]   They know how to box them.
[00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:09.960]   It's, this is why Samsung, as much as we
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:13.320]   justifiably make fun of their desire to,
[00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:15.400]   ooh, let's, our biggest feature is that
[00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:17.640]   we have a number on our feature chart
[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:19.480]   that's larger than another number.
[00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:20.960]   That's why you can't really dismiss them
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:22.560]   because man, they will figure,
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:25.280]   as soon as they figure out there's some money
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:26.440]   under the sun or the sofa,
[00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:28.080]   they will figure out a way to get under that sofa
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:29.440]   and get that money.
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:31.360]   - Well, yeah, and it gives,
[00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:33.800]   there are manufacturers and they're somewhat even
[00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:35.520]   on the operating system because they, you know,
[00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:36.920]   they both use the same operating system.
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:38.760]   So it really comes down to the hardware
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:41.040]   and Samsung is able to produce the hardware.
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:43.720]   - And that's where I give Steve Jobs a lot of credit.
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:46.720]   From day one, he said, and it wasn't his idea initially.
[00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:49.960]   I think it was, I don't remember who said it first,
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:52.800]   but if you wanna dominate in this,
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:55.000]   you have to make the software and the hardware.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:55.840]   You can't just make it.
[00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:58.960]   - And one of the first things he did when he got into Apple
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:01.440]   was to bury power computing and--
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:03.240]   - Get rid of all the roller pedals.
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:06.600]   - When I say bury, they literally put them in,
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:09.400]   rolled them over with a bulldozer.
[00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:10.640]   Yeah, it was quick.
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:14.240]   - If there's a famous really, really angry,
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:15.160]   we wouldn't call it a keynote,
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:19.280]   but a conference at a press event at a Mac world Boston,
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:22.280]   I think it was power computing or another of the clone makers,
[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:26.720]   held up like a zippered like laptop case CEO saying,
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:30.560]   this is our Mac clone laptop
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:32.240]   that we're now not allowed to sell
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:34.440]   and it kicks the butt of anything else that's out there
[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:36.200]   and Apple won't let us release it.
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:38.200]   I said, okay, well, it stinks to be you.
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:40.760]   - I think that was Motorola.
[00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:42.840]   And they were really upset because they,
[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:44.560]   they, you know, there was a miscalculation
[00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:48.000]   about the G4 and the G3 and the G3 team
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.680]   put more L2 cash in and suddenly it was way faster than G4.
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:55.200]   So all the cheap things that were gonna be
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:57.600]   that Apple was giving away as G3s,
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:44:00.120]   like in selling a lot cheaper or letting them license it
[00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:03.040]   suddenly were way faster than what it was gonna destroy
[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:03.880]   the company.
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:07.640]   Like literally the G3 G4 miscalculation and L2 cash
[00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:10.720]   or L3 cash was gonna, would have destroyed Apple
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:12.320]   if they hadn't buried it.
[00:44:12.320 --> 00:44:15.240]   - It was Alan Kay who was an Apple fellow for a long time
[00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:19.760]   but also an early pioneer in computing created small talk.
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:21.640]   I think he's at Xerox Park who said,
[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:24.560]   people who are really serious about software
[00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:26.840]   should make their own hardware
[00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:29.840]   and Steve Jobs really took that to heart, I think.
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:34.840]   That was something that for him was the foundation of Apple.
[00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:37.760]   And Apple has been working ever since
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:41.240]   to control the entire chain, not just hardware
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:42.680]   and software but all the hardware.
[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:45.320]   And look at the success of Apple Silicon
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:48.160]   which is a big step in that direction.
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:49.000]   If they own it all.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.600]   - And again, eventually it's gonna be one big chip.
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:52.920]   - One big chip that's inside of your,
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:54.880]   it's gonna be like a chip that you just slide in
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:57.480]   because they've talked about it in reports.
[00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:59.760]   So they said they talk about the legacy hardware
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:02.320]   that they still have to deal with as far as supply chains
[00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:03.720]   but they're gonna do with it for a long time.
[00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:05.400]   - Let me take a little break and then when we come back
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:08.840]   you do something every, you do it yearly, right?
[00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:10.960]   Jason's the hardware support card.
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:11.960]   Let's talk a little bit about that.
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:14.440]   That's where you go and ask some of the big names,
[00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:18.120]   not me ever but the big names in, not me ever
[00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:19.600]   but the big names in Apple.
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:20.440]   - I'll put you on the list next year.
[00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:21.280]   - No, no, I'm just kidding.
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:22.120]   I don't care.
[00:45:22.120 --> 00:45:24.280]   In the Apple journalism I like to give you a hard time.
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:25.440]   - All right, taking you off the list.
[00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:26.280]   - Take me off the list.
[00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:27.120]   I don't wanna be on the list.
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:28.400]   I have no idea.
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:29.600]   I'm the wrong guy to ask.
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:31.840]   - I love the saying cows don't ask,
[00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:33.960]   cows don't dance but they like to be asked.
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:35.680]   (laughing)
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:38.320]   I'm a cow in this scenario, okay?
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:40.240]   Our show today, we have a great panel
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:42.640]   and who needs to ask me when you got Jason Snell
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:44.880]   and Andy Inaco and Alex Lindsey,
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:47.440]   we're gonna talk about the Apple report card
[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:49.720]   from sixcolors.com in just a sec.
[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:51.520]   Our show today and our studio brought to you
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:54.640]   by our good friends at ACI Learning.
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:55.920]   You may say, well, who are they?
[00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:58.280]   Well, I know you know the name ITPro
[00:45:58.280 --> 00:45:59.040]   for the last decade.
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:02.520]   Our partners at ITPro have brought engaging,
[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:05.200]   entertaining IT training to level up
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:06.960]   your career organization.
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:11.480]   Well, now ITPro is part of ACI Learning
[00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:15.080]   and this has totally expanded the capabilities.
[00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:16.480]   It's very exciting.
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:18.760]   With ITPro, ACI Learning is expanding.
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:21.840]   It's reach, it's production capabilities,
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:25.240]   offering you the content and the learning mode
[00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:26.960]   you need at any stage in your development,
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:29.280]   whether you're at the very beginning of your career,
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:33.320]   looking to move up in your sector, ACI Learning
[00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:34.640]   is here to support your growth.
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:38.080]   Not only in IT now, but in audit readiness.
[00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:41.160]   Yeah, they've got auditPro and in cybersecurity.
[00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:46.000]   This is really exciting for our entire ITPro family.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.600]   We know a lot of you got into ITPro
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:52.440]   from this decade we've been talking about them.
[00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:55.360]   Well, now there's a whole lot more available to you.
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:57.760]   One of the most widely recognized beginner certificates,
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:01.880]   I bet a lot of you have the CompTIA A+ cert.
[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:03.720]   It's often where you start in IT.
[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:06.600]   CompTIA courses with ITPro from ACI Learning
[00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:09.520]   make it easy to go from daydreaming about that career
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:12.320]   in IT to launching it.
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:13.760]   Earning certificates open stores
[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:16.360]   to most entry level IT positions.
[00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:17.760]   It's frankly, if you think about it,
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:21.040]   they don't know you don't have previous skill,
[00:47:21.040 --> 00:47:22.720]   previous experience.
[00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:24.880]   So how do they know that you can do the job?
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:28.200]   If you got the certs for employers
[00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:30.520]   when you're getting started, that's the way of saying,
[00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:32.880]   yep, see, I know I've got my certs.
[00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:35.640]   It also shows more than just you have the knowledge,
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:38.680]   it shows you had the initiative and the ambition
[00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:41.240]   to learn that stuff, to take the test.
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:42.440]   It's not easy.
[00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:45.320]   And so as an employer, that also is encouraging.
[00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:49.280]   Okay, this person really takes this seriously.
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:54.280]   CompTIA courses with ITPro make it easy to go from daydreaming
[00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:57.360]   about that career in IT to launching it.
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:47:59.600]   Earning certificates open stores,
[00:47:59.600 --> 00:48:02.080]   it makes it possible for you to get into IT
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:06.880]   and then the sky's the limit because this is such a great field.
[00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:10.640]   Tech is one industry where opportunities outpace growth
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:12.840]   and one of the hottest opportunities right now,
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:14.880]   cybersecurity.
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:16.880]   Recent LinkedIn study predicts IT jobs
[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:19.760]   will be the most in demand roles in 2023.
[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:21.440]   There are far more jobs than there are people
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:22.360]   who could fill those jobs.
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:23.480]   There's no time to waste.
[00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:25.960]   This is a great opportunity for you.
[00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:29.280]   About one third of information security jobs require,
[00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:32.960]   require a cybersecurity certification.
[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:36.480]   That's more than the general IT.
[00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:39.640]   General IT is about 23% require a cert.
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:41.880]   Because when it comes to cybersecurity,
[00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:44.720]   you can't really gamble, right?
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:48.520]   When organizations are hungry for cybersecurity talent
[00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:49.800]   and they look out at the market,
[00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:52.320]   the cyber skills gap is getting bigger every day.
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:55.640]   The average salary now for cybersecurity specialists,
[00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:58.360]   $116,000.
[00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:01.760]   Wouldn't you like to be making that, doing something you love?
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:05.480]   ACI Learning's Information Security Analyst
[00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:08.120]   and Cybersecurity Specialist Programs
[00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:11.840]   could get you started, get you certified,
[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:15.080]   and these are widely accepted throughout the industry
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:18.680]   as the gold standard in what you need to get this job.
[00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:19.680]   They're gonna look at you and go,
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:21.480]   "Oh, yeah, you're hired."
[00:49:21.480 --> 00:49:26.960]   In 2022, the Global Cybersecurity Workforce Gap
[00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:29.000]   that is the number of people needed
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:30.200]   compared to the number of people available
[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:35.200]   increased by 26.2% compared to the last the year before 2021.
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:39.840]   So, I bet 2023 is gonna be even a bigger gap.
[00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:42.880]   There are jobs out there, well paid,
[00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:45.920]   fun, interesting jobs, careers.
[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:48.840]   That don't even call them jobs, careers available.
[00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:52.400]   ACI Learning offers multiple cybersecurity training programs
[00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:54.240]   that can prepare you to enter or advance
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:57.680]   with this really exciting growing industry.
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:59.840]   Among the most popular cybersecurity search,
[00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:01.440]   some of them aren't tough.
[00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:02.640]   I was talking to somebody the other day,
[00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:05.600]   he's working on a CISSP, that's tough.
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:08.400]   But it's a play, when you get that man, you're golden.
[00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:10.320]   EC Councils is my favorite one.
[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:13.840]   I still wanna do this, Certified Ethical Hacker.
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:16.960]   CEH, Certified Network Defender,
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:21.960]   Cybersecurity Audit School, Cybersecurity Frameworks.
[00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:24.440]   Where and how you learn really matters.
[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:28.560]   ACI Learning offers fully customizable training,
[00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:30.680]   no matter what kind of learner you are.

[00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:36.480]   of course IT pros always had that.
[00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:39.800]   ACI Learning adds in-person instruction as well.
[00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:43.040]   They have hubs now, you can go to, if you want to,
[00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:46.080]   and there's an advantage to be asking questions
[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:48.120]   in person to be with your peers learning.
[00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:50.760]   There's a lot to that, to what he said for that.
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:51.960]   The whole point is to take your learning
[00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:54.840]   beyond the classroom and get that great job.
[00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:56.720]   Explore what ACI Learning offers.

[00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:08.960]   You got practice labs, you've got those learning hubs
[00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:11.560]   and a great partnership program too.
[00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:13.720]   Tech is one industry where opportunities
[00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:15.840]   literally outpace growth.
[00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:18.160]   And there is no area of tech where it outpace
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:20.240]   is faster than cybersecurity.
[00:51:20.240 --> 00:51:21.840]   So many jobs open.
[00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:23.640]   One third of information security jobs
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:26.080]   require cybersecurity, cert.
[00:51:26.080 --> 00:51:28.600]   Maintain your competitive edge across audit IT
[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:30.440]   and cybersecurity readiness.

[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:17.760]   Thank you, ACI Learning.
[00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:24.000]   Okay, tell me what this report card is Mr. Jason Snell.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.880]   It is the thing that I've been doing
[00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:29.280]   for way too many years now since 2015.
[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:33.160]   It is me asking a bunch of people,
[00:52:33.160 --> 00:52:35.040]   they're developers and writers and podcasters
[00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:37.200]   and other people who I sort of quantified
[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:39.080]   as being Apple watchers.
[00:52:39.080 --> 00:52:41.360]   And 55 of them responded this year
[00:52:41.360 --> 00:52:44.160]   and I asked them across a whole bunch of categories
[00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:47.400]   to basically give Apple a rating for 2022 in this case
[00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:50.080]   from one to five and then fill out, you know,
[00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:52.240]   send me their feelings and I tell them don't write a lot
[00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:53.400]   and then they write a lot.
[00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:56.440]   They have all the feels, it turns out.
[00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:58.760]   Oh man, so we get some numbers,
[00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:01.800]   we get some change over time, which is really kind of fascinating.
[00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:04.120]   And then we get everybody's feelings out.
[00:53:04.120 --> 00:53:07.440]   So there's a, the way I always describe it is that it's almost
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:09.680]   like I'm trying to just get the vibe of the room.
[00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:12.760]   I'm just, it's just like a survey of a sentiment
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:13.840]   of how people are feeling.
[00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:17.280]   It doesn't prove anything, but I think that what it is,
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:20.440]   I think it's illustrative of what the people who pay attention
[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:23.600]   to Apple are sort of feeling about where Apple did well
[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:26.840]   and where Apple is not doing well over the last year.
[00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:31.320]   - And so this, I guess the most important chart
[00:53:31.320 --> 00:53:33.920]   would be the change year over year.
[00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:37.040]   And this is in sentiment among Apple watchers.
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:37.880]   - Yes.
[00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:39.600]   - Surprising that the max down a little bit,
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:43.080]   I mean it's only 0.4%, but it's still kind of surprising.
[00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:47.800]   The Mac, I think the lack, remember this is 2022,
[00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:50.720]   so I think the lack of the MacBook Pro coming out in the fall
[00:53:50.720 --> 00:53:51.840]   and the Mac mini a little bit.
[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:54.880]   - And the no Mac Pro at all, yeah.
[00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:58.080]   - Yes, that, and then I think they rolled some of the issues
[00:53:58.080 --> 00:54:00.640]   with the studio display camera and stuff in here too.
[00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:01.680]   And so that's why I went down.
[00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:05.000]   It's coming off of a real high and it still got a pretty good grade,
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:08.080]   but I think that they got dinged for not completing
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:10.080]   the Apple Silicon transition as they said they would
[00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:11.440]   and not getting that MacBook Pro out.
[00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:14.040]   - Still 4.2 out of 5 is pretty good.
[00:54:14.040 --> 00:54:15.600]   - That's a great, it's an A-minus, right?
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:17.040]   It's pretty good, pretty good.
[00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:19.720]   - I'm surprised the iPhone's only 3.9 out of 5.
[00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:23.960]   - Yeah, the iPhone, you know, they,
[00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:27.560]   I think people feel that it's a little bit boring.
[00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:33.880]   I think that that's the bottom line is that the iPhone 1314
[00:54:33.880 --> 00:54:38.560]   were minor updates and so people aren't that excited.
[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:40.520]   There are some Mac mini people out there, right,
[00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:42.400]   who are iPhone mini people who are mad
[00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:43.880]   about the small phone going away.
[00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:46.520]   - It's the champagne of smartphones.
[00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:48.480]   It's the gold standard.
[00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:51.040]   I don't know what you would do to make this thing better,
[00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:51.880]   to be honest.
[00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:53.440]   - It's actually the lowest,
[00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:55.040]   tied for the lowest score I've ever gotten
[00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:56.560]   from the panel about the iPhone too.
[00:54:56.560 --> 00:54:59.160]   And I wonder, I do think, honestly,
[00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:01.640]   it's just like the Mac going down in the era of Apple Silicon.
[00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:03.320]   I think it has to do more with a,
[00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:06.640]   what have you done for me lately approach to it
[00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:08.320]   than anything else?
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:10.240]   - What have you done to form me lately?
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:11.960]   It's so sad.
[00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:14.360]   Of course, even worse, HomeKit,
[00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:17.280]   which deserves a 2.7 out of five.
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:19.080]   - Can you imagine what your parents would say
[00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:23.400]   if you brought a D plus home, two periods in a row?
[00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:25.600]   'Cause this is, it's unchanged from last year,
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:27.400]   I guess good news everybody,
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:29.200]   the HomeKit score didn't go down.
[00:55:29.200 --> 00:55:32.960]   The bad news is, it was the average was 2.7 out of five.
[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:36.960]   It's a D plus, in my grade rubric, it's a D plus.
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:39.480]   And really the answer there is waiting for matter, right?
[00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:41.280]   Like everybody's like, well, Apple said matter
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:43.760]   would fix everything, but it hasn't come out yet,
[00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:46.640]   or at least it has to be better matters.
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:48.840]   It's not as high level as people thought.
[00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:50.800]   - Apple hasn't enabled it in HomeKit.
[00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:53.320]   And in fact, also they're reacting to the fact
[00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:56.880]   that late last year, Apple released their new home architecture
[00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:59.000]   that was supposed to be the foundation of all of this
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:02.120]   in beta and not too long after they released it,
[00:56:02.120 --> 00:56:03.600]   they turned it back off.
[00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:04.440]   - Broke everything.
[00:56:04.440 --> 00:56:07.400]   - Oops, so that all I think factored into the scores there.
[00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:09.400]   - Also low dev relations.
[00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:11.960]   Another D, 2.8 of five.
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:14.680]   And that's really the App Store probably, yeah.
[00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:19.400]   - I think that there's so much dislike of Apple's approach
[00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:22.960]   to developers, the fact that, you know,
[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:25.840]   the App Store is, we see lots of rejections in the App Store,
[00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:27.440]   and yet it's not very well curated.
[00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:29.080]   There's lots of scammy stuff that's in there.
[00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:31.600]   And there's general feeling like the only thing
[00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:33.680]   that's ever gonna stop Apple from behaving like this
[00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:34.760]   is governments. - Yeah.
[00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:36.920]   - And I think that they're all kind of resigned to that now.
[00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:40.480]   So it's the worst that developer relations has looked
[00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:43.080]   since Phil Schiller took it over and fixed a lot of problems
[00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:46.360]   with the App Store, 'cause it used to be worse.
[00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:48.320]   But it's still not great.
[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:52.320]   C minus, not quite a D, C minus, but on a downward slide
[00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:54.200]   ever since Phil sort of reforms kicked in,
[00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:57.040]   they've been sort of trending downward with all the others.
[00:56:57.040 --> 00:56:58.360]   Like 'cause I think there's something,
[00:56:58.360 --> 00:56:59.400]   especially if you're a developer,
[00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:01.240]   and mostly the people who voted in this category
[00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:05.200]   were developers, I think there's something really dispiriting
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:08.720]   in seeing Apple go to court and make proclamations
[00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:12.440]   in all sorts of places, defending their ability
[00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:14.720]   to do these things that the developers don't like,
[00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:16.760]   because they're like, oh, it's not a mistake,
[00:57:16.760 --> 00:57:17.960]   it's not that they're too busy.
[00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:20.800]   They're saying that the quiet part out loud now.
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:24.080]   And there's always been an attitude among people at Apple
[00:57:24.080 --> 00:57:26.040]   that the App Store is there, and the iPhone
[00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:27.800]   of their great invention, and the developers
[00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:30.080]   are sort of lucky to be brought along with them.
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:31.480]   And developers, guess what?
[00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:32.440]   They resent that.
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:38.080]   Yeah, it's always been, it's institutionally a problem.
[00:57:38.080 --> 00:57:40.120]   It's not just about App Store rejections,
[00:57:40.120 --> 00:57:45.120]   it's really about how much pride developers have
[00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:49.040]   in their apps, and that they feel as though
[00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:53.280]   the audience, they deserve to have a closer relationship
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:54.800]   with the people who use those apps,
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:56.800]   and they feel, excuse me, I'm sorry,
[00:57:56.800 --> 00:57:59.080]   I should not speak for the entire developer community,
[00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:01.480]   but this is what I keep hearing time and time again
[00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:05.520]   from developers, that it's really, really difficult
[00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:08.440]   to basically create a community of users behind your app,
[00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:11.120]   because Apple does everything they possibly can
[00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:13.760]   to make sure that the people who buy your app,
[00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:15.600]   they're not users of your app,
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:17.040]   they're users of the App Store,
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:18.680]   they're users of the iPhone.
[00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:21.160]   Isn't it wonderful Apple, the Apple, aren't we wonderful?
[00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:23.000]   We gave you this wonderful app,
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:25.960]   when the developer is like, no, we want to have a 20 year,
[00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:28.440]   before the App Store, there are companies that have
[00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:30.920]   like 20 year relationships with certain customers,
[00:58:30.920 --> 00:58:32.960]   because there is this one to one relationship,
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:36.600]   they know the developers, they know it as a really wonderful
[00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:40.040]   shop, and the App Store relationship just really tries hard
[00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:41.600]   to negate that in every opportunity.
[00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:42.600]   - How many of the-- - The other big thing
[00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:45.920]   that happened this year was the fact that they remember
[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:48.320]   they did that thing where they put lots of crappy ads
[00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:50.600]   on individual app pages at some point,
[00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:51.680]   and then they backed off of it,
[00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:55.280]   that was like the top of mind when the survey was taken,
[00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:58.840]   was it's like, and it was again, is that the deepest cut?
[00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:02.440]   No, but it is the latest in a whole long series of a thousand cuts.
[00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:04.560]   - How many of the 55 are developers?
[00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:09.840]   - I'd say maybe 20-ish, and they're the ones,
[00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:11.920]   like most people who were not developers
[00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:13.720]   didn't vote in this category.
[00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:14.560]   - Oh, interesting, okay.
[00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:16.720]   - They just said they had no opinion
[00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:18.880]   about developer relations, some members of the press
[00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:22.240]   and the developers themselves had opinions.
[00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:25.560]   - Yeah, it's the lowest, no, it's not the lowest,
[00:59:25.560 --> 00:59:28.040]   home gets the lowest, but it's the next lowest square,
[00:59:28.040 --> 00:59:30.160]   and it's pretty darn close.
[00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:33.120]   Highest score goes to hardware reliability.
[00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:36.400]   People think the Apple stuff's pretty reliable.
[00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:39.000]   I guess it is compared to everything else.
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.000]   - And a lot of goodwill about the,
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.040]   after what happened in the mid-2010s
[00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:44.880]   with the butterfly keyboard and stuff like that,
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:47.480]   I think people feel like the Apple Silicon hardware
[00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:48.840]   is pretty solid, and not only is there--
[00:59:48.840 --> 00:59:51.280]   - And then we're responsive, and there's right to repair,
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:53.320]   and something. - Yeah, and there's a proxy here
[00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:54.720]   of just like, is the hardware good,
[00:59:54.720 --> 00:59:56.280]   I think is part of what's going on here,
[00:59:56.280 --> 00:59:58.000]   but also I think it's the, you know,
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.840]   do we have a terrible situation like the keyboard?
[01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:02.560]   We don't, thank goodness for that,
[01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:04.360]   and so it's a little bit of a honeymoon there.
[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:06.840]   - Next highest score, wearables.
[01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:10.720]   I think the Apple Watch is a home run, yes, we all agree.
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:12.160]   - Those are both, actually, yeah.
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:15.000]   - Oh, wearables is a separate from Apple Watch.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.920]   So what did you mean?
[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:20.720]   - Well, so I added Apple,
[01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:22.200]   what I started with Apple Watch,
[01:00:22.200 --> 01:00:25.120]   and I turned it into wearables mid-stream,
[01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:26.760]   so there's sort of two scores there,
[01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:28.680]   because I'm still asking the original question,
[01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:30.240]   just kind of for historic reasons,
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:33.600]   at some point I'll stop doing that, but maybe next year.
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:36.160]   But the idea there is I wanted to ask sort of about,
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:38.160]   now we think of that category as wearables, right?
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:39.520]   So it's not just about the Apple Watch,
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:41.040]   but it's about AirPods and stuff like that.
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:42.760]   And Apple scored really well, you know,
[01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:45.080]   these are places where Apple is doing pretty well.
[01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:47.840]   I think that everybody was really happy
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:48.920]   with the Apple Watch Ultra,
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:51.480]   that Apple is doing something new with the Apple Watch,
[01:00:51.480 --> 01:00:54.600]   because that is a place that had sort of stagnated
[01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:55.600]   the last couple of years,
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:57.320]   and so I think that that was a positive.
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:00.080]   And the new AirPods Pro 2 came out last year,
[01:01:00.080 --> 01:01:02.840]   and that was by all accounts a winner for all concerned,
[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:05.000]   and so I think people are pretty high on that category.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   - Is it just me, I feel like the Apple AirPods
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.200]   and the Pro, the regular AirPods and the Max,
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:15.360]   are kind of middle of the road quality and overpriced.
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:17.400]   I don't think they're a home run,
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:21.000]   if they're a home run for Apple, because of the ecosystem.
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.320]   But in terms of comparison to other products,
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:26.200]   there are better products at a lower price,
[01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:27.600]   or is that just me?
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:30.000]   - Well, I mean, there's some difference of opinion there,
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.360]   but I think if you're in the Apple ecosystem,
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:34.440]   the other products don't have the Apple Secret Sauce
[01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:35.800]   that makes them a better product
[01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:37.600]   if you use other Apple products.
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:39.960]   And that is tangible, right?
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:44.960]   Like AirPods Pro, I think, is a very, very good product.
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:48.160]   AirPods Max, I know people who love it,
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:50.120]   but that one seems to be very much.
[01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:52.600]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:54.040]   Whereas I bought AirPods Pro 2,
[01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:54.880]   and I have no regrets,
[01:01:54.880 --> 01:01:57.080]   because I think that is a spectacularly good product.
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:58.920]   - They're good, and I think the integration
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:02.080]   into the iPhone ecosystem is really great.
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:05.080]   And so as a result, yeah, even though audio-wise,
[01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:06.680]   you know, they're middle of the pack,
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:08.960]   but that's good enough when you include
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:11.480]   all the other features in it, so.
[01:02:11.480 --> 01:02:12.480]   - Yeah.
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:15.560]   I think it's still a very Johnny I've sort of designed
[01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:17.320]   where, oh my God, it looks great.
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:19.720]   And it really just tickles whatever part
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:23.720]   of your prehistoric genetic DNA
[01:02:23.720 --> 01:02:25.800]   that likes to brighten shiny objects.
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:27.640]   'Cause they are beautiful and they're wonderful,
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:30.000]   but then you get into, okay,
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.560]   but now I need to throw this to my backpack.
[01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:33.400]   Oh, well, it's not as easy to throw
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:35.000]   into a backpack as almost anything else.
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.960]   And oh, they're really, really heavy.
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:37.800]   - You're talking about the max.
[01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:39.480]   - Much heavier. - Yeah, exactly.
[01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:40.320]   Yeah.
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:42.760]   And I agree with you on the AirBuds.
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:44.840]   I think they're much better values out there.
[01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:47.040]   And really, I think what you're buying,
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:49.240]   the premium is for audio-force.
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:50.080]   - These are not for audio.
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:50.920]   - It's not for audio.
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:52.800]   - I don't think audio-buds are gonna be,
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:53.840]   AirBuds, excuse me,
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:55.920]   have your thoughts in general, it's gonna be.
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:58.120]   But I think that there's a lot of value in,
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:02.320]   I'll give you $75 if it means that every single time
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:04.600]   I think that I'm connected to my AirBuds,
[01:03:04.600 --> 01:03:06.840]   I'm actually connected to my AirBuds.
[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:09.320]   And that's something that sometimes to a fault
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:11.200]   that Apple delivers that.
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:12.400]   - That, I don't know.
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:14.240]   And maybe I just have too many devices in one place,
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:15.920]   but the biggest problem that I have
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:20.040]   is with my AirPods is that I pick up my phone.
[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:22.280]   I'm looking at my phone
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:24.040]   and it's picking something else
[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:26.120]   or not connecting to my AirPods.
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:29.560]   And when I first got them, they seemed to work fine.
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:31.640]   And as things got more whatever,
[01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:33.200]   it suddenly is like,
[01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:35.960]   I just don't know if it's gonna pick the right one.
[01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:37.320]   And that's been the most frustrating part.
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:38.120]   And so then I started,
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:40.280]   what happens is this is with a problem with an ecosystem.
[01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:41.480]   It's once I got out of that ecosystem,
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:42.560]   I started using lots of different.
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:44.720]   So I have like three different headsets
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:45.800]   typically floating around.
[01:03:45.800 --> 01:03:48.160]   I have, I use Opencoms when I'm talking to people
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:52.040]   on the phone because they, I sound better to them.
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:52.960]   Because it's got a boom.
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:55.280]   And then I listen to my ultimate ears,
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:57.720]   they fit because they sound better to me.
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:00.600]   So I listen to those when I'm listening to music,
[01:04:00.600 --> 01:04:01.800]   I'm walking around or working.
[01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:02.640]   And then if I really like it,
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:05.400]   I still like the maxes for what I'm really like.
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:08.320]   The number one use for my maxes is for my TV.
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:10.040]   So I, when I'm-- - Interesting.
[01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:14.800]   - So I, we have a, you know, the TV room is carries
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:16.840]   into the rest of the house a lot.
[01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:20.480]   And so, so there's some, you know, there's a,
[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:23.800]   I, there's like the family headset that's a Bluetooth
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:25.080]   that somebody sent me a long time ago
[01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:26.680]   that everybody uses and I can,
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:28.160]   I don't understand how it works.
[01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:29.520]   Like I can't figure out what the buttons do.
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:33.480]   So I put on my air max and I, like my, my wife, my kids,
[01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:35.560]   they all know how that, how that one works.
[01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:36.440]   I don't know.
[01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:38.560]   So I just bring my max in and watch TV.
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:40.640]   - I'm in a almost identical situation.
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:44.640]   And when I sit down and make a conference call or phone call,
[01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:46.920]   I look at my Opencoms, I look at my max,
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:47.760]   I look at my AirPods,
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:49.640]   I almost always choose the AirShocks.
[01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:51.680]   Because if you say it, it sound,
[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:53.720]   it's not your sound quality, that's okay.
[01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:55.720]   But the, it's mostly the, I can,
[01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:57.200]   I can do dishes and no one notices.
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:58.880]   That is literally what the things are going to be.
[01:04:58.880 --> 01:04:59.840]   - Yeah, I like the open air.
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:02.720]   Yeah, the, the aftershocks, former sponsor are,
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:05.840]   are bone conduction, so they don't cover your ear.
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:07.280]   And then I think you're right,
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:08.400]   when I'm looking at an Apple TV,
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:10.600]   I'm always going to reach for an Apple product.
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:12.520]   Cause I always have to remember where the Opencoms,
[01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:14.360]   now I push and hold this button and,
[01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:16.440]   and then it pairs with that and then a,
[01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:20.200]   so there's that extra cost.
[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:22.200]   And then when I want comfort,
[01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:25.240]   the UE fits are really good cause they're, they're molded.
[01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:26.560]   - They just feel like they're part of your ear.
[01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:27.400]   - Yeah.
[01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:29.320]   - And, and I find that the bass is way better and overall.
[01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:30.360]   - No, I think they sound better.
[01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:33.520]   Although it's great, you can almost wear those AirPods
[01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:36.160]   around all the time with AirPods Pro 2,
[01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:38.120]   because when the phone rings, it says, you know,
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:40.320]   you're getting a call from Lisa and you can say,
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:43.160]   I'll take it and all of that integration is pretty nice
[01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:45.600]   for like all the time.
[01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:48.320]   - So it's, you know, it's kind of perfect.
[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:50.400]   - The pairing, and maybe, maybe the new ones pair better
[01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:52.440]   because the pairing may be so frustrated that I have,
[01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:54.280]   I just don't mind Apple products.
[01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:56.080]   - No, yeah, they seem to have solved that or maybe,
[01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:58.880]   it's very possible that I am just so, you know,
[01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:01.960]   used to it that I know I know I'm gonna have to choose
[01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:02.880]   to keep it on there.
[01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:05.400]   I don't, I think they have, I think the AirPods Pro are
[01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:07.560]   two or better than they used to be.
[01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:09.040]   I used to lose it all the time.
[01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:09.880]   Are they, is that interesting?
[01:06:09.880 --> 01:06:10.880]   - I mean, I have a lot of phones,
[01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:12.400]   I have a lot of iPads, I have a lot of Macs,
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:14.360]   I have a lot of things that it could choose from,
[01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:16.400]   but I just feel like when I'm holding a phone,
[01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:18.360]   it should, like I just feel like you're Apple, man.
[01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:21.680]   - That's partly that's Bluetooth's problem though, right?
[01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:22.840]   - But I'm like, it should know that,
[01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:27.000]   it should know with the W1 chip or whatever,
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.480]   that the phone is moving and it's in a state
[01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:32.120]   of listening to something like that.
[01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:33.320]   - It should be smarter.
[01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:34.600]   I think they're better though, Jason,
[01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:35.760]   you think they're better than they used to be.
[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:36.600]   - I think they are.
[01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:38.120]   - I don't know what they're wrong.
[01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:39.600]   - I don't get frustrated by that.
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:41.720]   Why are you connecting to the wrong thing nearly
[01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:43.060]   as much as I used to, you know,
[01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:44.340]   walking out of the house.
[01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:46.060]   I put them in, you know,
[01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:48.360]   I put the earbuds in my ears when I'm next to my iPhone,
[01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:49.840]   it connects to the phone,
[01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:51.520]   I walk out of my house and start playing something
[01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:53.760]   on my Apple watch and it immediately switches
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:55.380]   and starts playing it off the Apple watch.
[01:06:55.380 --> 01:06:58.520]   Ironically though, we're talking about AirPods.
[01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:01.840]   Wirecutter says that, especially if you're an Apple user,
[01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:04.560]   the best earbuds are the BeatsFit Pro,
[01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:06.120]   which are $50 cheaper.
[01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:06.960]   - Are they as good?
[01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:07.800]   I haven't even used them.
[01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:10.960]   - Also from Apple, and $50 cheaper,
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:15.580]   and they've got a physical control for volume,
[01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:18.300]   but you know, and it doesn't have
[01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:19.380]   like a wireless charging case,
[01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:22.940]   but just remember, Apple doesn't just make the AirPods,
[01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:24.860]   they also make the BeatsFit products,
[01:07:24.860 --> 01:07:28.060]   and in many cases, those can be as good or better.
[01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:30.740]   - Yeah, if you want voice activated Siri control,
[01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:35.740]   the BeatsFit Pro, $150, so it's a hundred bucks less.
[01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:36.980]   Is that 50 bucks less?
[01:07:36.980 --> 01:07:37.820]   No, it's a hundred bucks.
[01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:38.660]   - 50 bucks less.
[01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:39.500]   - Oh, okay.
[01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:43.020]   If you're an Apple fan who wants all the pairing
[01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:44.300]   and voice control convenience,
[01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:47.100]   so have you used these, Jason?
[01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:48.300]   - I have, and I have friends who have,
[01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:51.700]   who say they sound great, I am an AirPods person,
[01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:54.140]   AirPods Pro person, that's the one that fits the best for me,
[01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:55.300]   but these look good too.
[01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:59.020]   I kind of like that they're not the white ones
[01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:01.020]   that are always there for Apple.
[01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:02.460]   Other colors exist.
[01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:06.260]   - I'm just curious if they have all the functionality
[01:08:06.260 --> 01:08:09.060]   the AirPods Pro to have.
[01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:12.700]   - I think it's based on the AirPods original,
[01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:15.800]   so I think it doesn't have the latest and greatest stuff
[01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:17.700]   that's in the AirPods Pro 2, I think.
[01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:21.780]   - The noise cancellation in the AirPods 2 is really good.
[01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:23.100]   Really, really good.
[01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:23.940]   - I think it is.
[01:08:23.940 --> 01:08:25.340]   - Good enough to wear it on an airplane.
[01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:29.020]   And that's hard to do for earbuds.
[01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:33.100]   And I think that Kevin Tofel did an article
[01:08:33.100 --> 01:08:37.340]   on Stacy's webpage, StacyOnIOT.com,
[01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:42.060]   about using his AirPods Pro 2 as hearing aids.
[01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:44.300]   And of course, they're not as good as hearing aids
[01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:46.340]   in terms of battery life and so forth,
[01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:48.620]   but he was able to use it to improve his hearing
[01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:49.940]   in a lot of situations.
[01:08:49.940 --> 01:08:51.020]   And that's kind of cool.
[01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:52.500]   And I think that's a newer feature.
[01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:54.220]   I don't know if the Beats Fit would do that.
[01:08:54.220 --> 01:08:55.060]   - Yeah.
[01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:59.660]   Yeah, there's a lot of untapped potential in this stuff.
[01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:01.660]   I don't go, you've heard me say this before,
[01:09:01.660 --> 01:09:03.580]   so I won't go into my usual rant again,
[01:09:03.580 --> 01:09:06.620]   but if Apple or Google or somebody decides
[01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:08.180]   they're gonna do augmented reality
[01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:10.620]   as just this one earbud that you might be wearing
[01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:12.460]   in your ear, oh my goodness,
[01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:14.500]   could they really tick off?
[01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:17.740]   Could they, especially if it's enhanced with
[01:09:17.740 --> 01:09:19.740]   Apple Secret Sauce that makes sure
[01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:21.460]   that when you're talking to your assistant,
[01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:23.300]   you're definitely talking to your assistant
[01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:25.060]   and no other noise is getting in,
[01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:27.460]   especially if it can tell where you're looking,
[01:09:27.460 --> 01:09:30.020]   or rather where your head is turned at one point.
[01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:31.260]   There's a lot of potential there.
[01:09:31.260 --> 01:09:35.300]   And that would justify for me the $200, $250 expense.
[01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:38.900]   For me though, however, anything that's a wireless earbud
[01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:42.220]   is more like how well does it fit into my ear.
[01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:43.900]   And once you've got that,
[01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:47.140]   is it reasonably good audio meaning
[01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:48.980]   I don't notice how bad the audio is.
[01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:50.100]   And then after that, it's like, well,
[01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:54.020]   I'd much rather buy, if I have choice between $250
[01:09:54.020 --> 01:09:55.740]   for these really nice name brand ones,
[01:09:55.740 --> 01:09:59.740]   or I could buy three sets of really nice 80 or $90 ones
[01:09:59.740 --> 01:10:02.140]   and make sure that there's one in each one of my bags,
[01:10:02.140 --> 01:10:05.380]   now that more and more of my devices
[01:10:05.380 --> 01:10:07.860]   don't have headphone ports,
[01:10:07.860 --> 01:10:09.980]   it's like that becomes a lot more important.
[01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:12.380]   These creature comforts become as important
[01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:14.420]   as the sound quality, I think, for most people.
[01:10:14.420 --> 01:10:15.780]   - Yeah.
[01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:18.060]   Well, you got a choice, which is good.
[01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:22.420]   The one report card grade I was surprised to see,
[01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:23.940]   that we're talking about the six colors
[01:10:23.940 --> 01:10:27.300]   Apple report card, the thing Jason does every year,
[01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:29.740]   is in environmental and social,
[01:10:29.740 --> 01:10:32.180]   where Apple really touts this,
[01:10:32.180 --> 01:10:34.260]   they bring Lisa Jackson on,
[01:10:34.260 --> 01:10:35.820]   stand on the roof and stuff,
[01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:36.820]   to really tout this,
[01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:39.540]   and it only got a 3.4, that's kind of a C minus.
[01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:40.380]   - Yeah.
[01:10:40.380 --> 01:10:41.220]   - How come?
[01:10:41.220 --> 01:10:42.460]   - So this category is funny,
[01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:44.260]   and some people ask like, why do I even do it?
[01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:45.580]   And the answer is Apple talks about
[01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:47.220]   how they want to change the world
[01:10:47.220 --> 01:10:48.220]   and make the world a better place.
[01:10:48.220 --> 01:10:50.500]   And I think that opens them up to questions
[01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:51.340]   about how they're doing.
[01:10:51.340 --> 01:10:53.820]   This is also everybody sees something different in here,
[01:10:53.820 --> 01:10:56.380]   like people talk about their commitment to accessibility,
[01:10:56.380 --> 01:10:57.860]   and they say that they're doing great,
[01:10:57.860 --> 01:10:59.180]   or their commitment to green energy,
[01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:00.620]   and they say that it's really admirable,
[01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:03.580]   or using recycled metals in their products is great.
[01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:04.380]   But I will tell you,
[01:11:04.380 --> 01:11:06.500]   one of the big trends this year was,
[01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:08.540]   Apple playing hardball
[01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:11.940]   and trying to prevent its retail employees from unionizing.
[01:11:11.940 --> 01:11:13.500]   And a lot of people just said,
[01:11:13.500 --> 01:11:17.420]   they're like on the one hand advanced data production,
[01:11:17.420 --> 01:11:19.140]   good job, we really like that.
[01:11:19.140 --> 01:11:20.420]   On the other hand,
[01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:23.220]   trying to be a union buster, not so cool.
[01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:24.620]   And really everybody,
[01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:27.260]   it literally everybody can believe,
[01:11:27.260 --> 01:11:29.100]   they can put into that category what they want,
[01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:31.420]   all I'm doing is taking their numbers and averaging it out.
[01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:33.780]   But I think that that was the big one that I saw
[01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:35.500]   as a trend was the union.
[01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:37.860]   - Also the fact that, I mean,
[01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:38.980]   - I've turned to work a little bit too.
[01:11:38.980 --> 01:11:42.980]   - AirPods are not exactly environmentally friendly products.
[01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:43.820]   - Yeah.
[01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:45.580]   - You can't be at least.
[01:11:45.580 --> 01:11:47.140]   - Apple would tell you that you should bring them back
[01:11:47.140 --> 01:11:47.980]   when you're done with them,
[01:11:47.980 --> 01:11:49.540]   and then they will disassemble them and all of that.
[01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:51.620]   But yeah, they are the least,
[01:11:51.620 --> 01:11:54.020]   least friendly and easily risk,
[01:11:54.020 --> 01:11:56.100]   because they're glued in little tiny batteries and stuff.
[01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:58.020]   - Yeah, it's true.
[01:11:58.020 --> 01:11:58.860]   - Okay.
[01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:02.580]   - Yeah, the NLRB just decided that the complaint
[01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:07.580]   that when Tim Cook basically said company-wide
[01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:10.100]   that people who talk about events
[01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:13.860]   and about going on inside of Apple are enemies of Apple,
[01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:17.460]   we hate them as much as I'm sure you loyal Apple employees do.
[01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:18.300]   - Whoa.
[01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:21.100]   - I wish we assure you we will continue to discover
[01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:23.860]   and crush the people who discuss things
[01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:25.820]   that we don't want employees to discuss.
[01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:27.460]   NLRB said, "Hey, you know what?
[01:12:27.460 --> 01:12:30.980]   "We actually do think that maybe that was intimidation
[01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:33.260]   "of employees and people who tried to unionize.
[01:12:33.260 --> 01:12:34.820]   "We're gonna continue to move forward on this."
[01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:35.660]   - Wow.
[01:12:35.660 --> 01:12:36.500]   - What you know?
[01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:37.340]   - Wow.
[01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:38.860]   That sounds like the 1984 ad.
[01:12:38.860 --> 01:12:40.980]   That's what the guy was saying on the screen.
[01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:42.860]   - That was so tone deaf.
[01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:44.540]   Even I was surprised by that.
[01:12:44.540 --> 01:12:49.100]   To have, again, because this came right after Apple
[01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:53.260]   had some negative PR, which they never enjoy having,
[01:12:53.260 --> 01:12:57.100]   about unionization and working conditions inside of Apple.
[01:12:57.100 --> 01:13:00.420]   And Tim Cook's like staff-wide email was,
[01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:04.660]   "We've heard all, we've seen the same reports you did,
[01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:07.460]   "and we feel exactly as you do pause.
[01:13:07.460 --> 01:13:10.100]   "We are upset that our employees have..."
[01:13:10.100 --> 01:13:11.260]   (laughing)
[01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:15.060]   Don't worry, we're gonna fight for you people who are loyal.
[01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:15.900]   - Yes.
[01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:17.220]   - And don't wish for us to crush you.
[01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:19.900]   Like, okay, Tim, settle down.
[01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:20.740]   - Oh, wow.
[01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:24.980]   - Oh, all right.
[01:13:25.820 --> 01:13:27.460]   All right, let's take another break,
[01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:30.140]   and then when we come back, all the other Apple news.
[01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:32.380]   I think we've said enough there is to say
[01:13:32.380 --> 01:13:33.820]   about Apple's results, yeah?
[01:13:33.820 --> 01:13:34.660]   - Yep.
[01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:37.820]   - And probably more than there was to say about it.
[01:13:37.820 --> 01:13:39.860]   Let's be frank.
[01:13:39.860 --> 01:13:41.420]   This is "Say for Internet Day."
[01:13:41.420 --> 01:13:42.820]   So please, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:45.660]   wear your seat belts as you listen to the show today.
[01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:49.380]   We don't want anything to happen to our fine audience.
[01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:51.300]   And if something does happen to you,
[01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:53.820]   then there's Zoktok, our sponsor.
[01:13:53.820 --> 01:13:55.420]   (laughing)
[01:13:55.420 --> 01:13:58.420]   I have to say, I've used Zoktok, I love Zoktok.
[01:13:58.420 --> 01:14:00.420]   There's nothing worse than going to a doctor's appointment
[01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:02.380]   thinking, I'm gonna be the center of attention.
[01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:04.620]   And the doctor's like looking at his watch,
[01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:07.340]   not paying attention, not helping you.
[01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:12.340]   Instead of getting a doctor that doesn't work for you,
[01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:15.380]   go to Zoktok.
[01:14:15.380 --> 01:14:20.380]   Zoktok is a free app that lets you find in book doctors.
[01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:24.820]   But more importantly, maybe, they've got patient reviews.
[01:14:25.660 --> 01:14:28.020]   And you know they're gonna take your insurance.
[01:14:28.020 --> 01:14:29.100]   That's one of the search fields.
[01:14:29.100 --> 01:14:30.260]   They're available when you need them.
[01:14:30.260 --> 01:14:32.820]   And they treat almost any condition under the sun.
[01:14:32.820 --> 01:14:35.100]   It's not just doctors, it's dentists, too.
[01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:36.620]   Chiropractors.
[01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:41.620]   Zoktok is absolutely the way to find your next doctor.
[01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:44.260]   Somebody who does it the way you want.
[01:14:44.260 --> 01:14:46.620]   Now everybody has kind of a different opinion
[01:14:46.620 --> 01:14:48.260]   about how your doctor should be.
[01:14:48.260 --> 01:14:49.980]   Some people want the doctor just to say,
[01:14:49.980 --> 01:14:51.620]   this is what you should do, do it.
[01:14:51.620 --> 01:14:52.460]   Boom.
[01:14:52.460 --> 01:14:54.340]   Some people wanna hear all the rationales
[01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:55.500]   and wanna hear the information.
[01:14:55.500 --> 01:14:57.580]   I suspect much of our audiences like that.
[01:14:57.580 --> 01:14:59.140]   But here's how you find out.
[01:14:59.140 --> 01:15:01.300]   What kind of doctor is this doctor?
[01:15:01.300 --> 01:15:03.060]   Because those reviews will tell you.
[01:15:03.060 --> 01:15:05.820]   And I'll tell you what, the worst time in the world is
[01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:06.980]   when you're not feeling your best,
[01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:08.380]   you're trying to hold it together,
[01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:09.880]   and now you gotta find a doctor.
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:11.380]   You're just gonna go to the first one.
[01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:14.280]   This is the time to go to Zoktok right now.
[01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:15.220]   Use their free app.
[01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:16.980]   Millions of users rely on it.

[01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:19.860]   and fits your schedule.
[01:15:19.860 --> 01:15:22.700]   And you can really drill down on the specialties, too.
[01:15:22.700 --> 01:15:24.740]   I was looking for, not for myself,
[01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:26.220]   but for a family member,
[01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:29.460]   a doctor specializes in gerontology geriatrics.
[01:15:29.460 --> 01:15:33.820]   I found a doctor, was a perfect fit.
[01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:35.580]   Book an appointment with a few taps in there,
[01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:38.660]   although I will soon be looking for a geriatrics doctor, too.
[01:15:38.660 --> 01:15:40.620]   Book an appointment with a few taps in their app.
[01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:43.300]   You can start feeling better with Zoktok.
[01:15:43.300 --> 01:15:46.380]   iOS or Android, but I know you're gonna want the iOS version.
[01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:49.620]   Actually, as always, the best thing to do,
[01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:50.780]   you might be tempted to go to the app store.
[01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:53.540]   Go to the website, zoktok.com/macbreak
[01:15:53.540 --> 01:15:55.540]   and you get the link right there and you can go right to it.
[01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:56.780]   It's the fastest way to find it.
[01:15:56.780 --> 01:16:01.620]   Zoktok, Z-O-C, d-o-c.com/macbreak.
[01:16:01.620 --> 01:16:03.300]   Download the Zoktok app for free,
[01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:07.500]   then find and book a top rated doctor right now.
[01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:10.940]   Many of them, by the way, available within 24 hours.
[01:16:10.940 --> 01:16:11.780]   That's the other thing.
[01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:12.780]   Sometimes you find a doctor
[01:16:12.780 --> 01:16:14.460]   and they're not taking new patients.
[01:16:14.460 --> 01:16:15.660]   That's frustrating.
[01:16:15.660 --> 01:16:17.100]   You don't have to worry about that with Zoktok.
[01:16:17.100 --> 01:16:20.620]   Z-O-C, d-o-c.com/macbreak.
[01:16:20.620 --> 01:16:24.940]   Authenticated, verified reviews.
[01:16:24.940 --> 01:16:27.700]   All the doctors, they're all in there.
[01:16:27.700 --> 01:16:28.580]   It's just the greatest.
[01:16:28.580 --> 01:16:31.900]   Zoktok.com/macbreak.
[01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:34.900]   We thank them so much for not just supporting our show,
[01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:36.140]   but really for doing what they do.
[01:16:36.140 --> 01:16:37.820]   'Cause it's a really useful service.
[01:16:37.820 --> 01:16:41.860]   Zoktok.com/macbreak.
[01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:43.300]   Are you all excited, Jason Snell,
[01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:46.540]   to watch Major League Soccer on Apple TV?
[01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:49.420]   I'm sure.
[01:16:49.420 --> 01:16:50.740]   (laughs)
[01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:52.580]   Now Premier League, that's something else,
[01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:56.940]   but this is MLS, which is the American Soccer League.
[01:16:56.940 --> 01:17:00.620]   They launched it in 100 territories,
[01:17:00.620 --> 01:17:02.980]   which tells me that it's not just in the US.
[01:17:02.980 --> 01:17:05.980]   Nope, this is part of their worldwide soccer strategy.
[01:17:05.980 --> 01:17:08.660]   You can watch this stuff all over the world,
[01:17:08.660 --> 01:17:09.700]   the American Soccer League,
[01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:12.020]   which a lot of soccer stops will be like,
[01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:12.900]   the American Soccer League.
[01:17:12.900 --> 01:17:13.740]   That's not very good.
[01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:15.980]   Yeah, what are how that goes over in Barcelona?
[01:17:15.980 --> 01:17:17.580]   Or, I mean, Madrid.
[01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:19.660]   Let's say, I mean, a lot of these games are at night.
[01:17:19.660 --> 01:17:21.780]   They're not gonna really be watching them in Europe anyway,
[01:17:21.780 --> 01:17:24.180]   but they may be watching them in Central and South America
[01:17:24.180 --> 01:17:26.780]   and in Asia, where they are not necessarily
[01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:30.500]   the European soccer snobs that Europe is.
[01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:31.860]   So, we'll see how it goes.
[01:17:31.860 --> 01:17:33.220]   This is how you start.
[01:17:33.220 --> 01:17:34.060]   It'll be, yeah.
[01:17:34.060 --> 01:17:35.260]   I think it's an interesting idea, yeah.
[01:17:35.260 --> 01:17:38.820]   $99 for the whole season or $15 a month.
[01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:41.220]   It does-- 79 if you're an Apple TV plus, subscribe.
[01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:42.620]   If you already have Apple TV plus,
[01:17:42.620 --> 01:17:45.300]   and of course, if you have a family,
[01:17:45.300 --> 01:17:47.980]   you can share it to up to six members.
[01:17:47.980 --> 01:17:50.900]   Are they cracking down like Netflix is?
[01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:53.620]   Do you have to, the family in Apple's terms
[01:17:53.620 --> 01:17:55.140]   have to be in the same IP address?
[01:17:55.140 --> 01:17:55.980]   No.
[01:17:55.980 --> 01:17:56.820]   No.
[01:17:56.820 --> 01:17:57.660]   It's anybody.
[01:17:57.660 --> 01:17:58.500]   It's your family.
[01:17:58.500 --> 01:17:59.820]   You still have to have hardware.
[01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:01.420]   Like, that's the advantage of it.
[01:18:01.420 --> 01:18:03.460]   It's not a software-only thing.
[01:18:03.460 --> 01:18:06.900]   They have a dongle of some kind that you have to deal with
[01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:07.980]   all the time.
[01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:11.340]   And I think that a 10-year contract
[01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:14.020]   is an opportunity to innovate around live sports.
[01:18:14.020 --> 01:18:16.100]   It doesn't like how it goes the first year
[01:18:16.100 --> 01:18:18.860]   is going to be them figuring out how--
[01:18:18.860 --> 01:18:21.220]   the baseball, Friday night, baseball
[01:18:21.220 --> 01:18:22.660]   was them starting to figure that out.
[01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:24.940]   And to be honest with you, not doing very well
[01:18:24.940 --> 01:18:25.900]   when they first started.
[01:18:25.900 --> 01:18:27.500]   We'll see how the season goes.
[01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:30.660]   But the commentary was disastrous.
[01:18:30.660 --> 01:18:32.540]   And hopefully they'll get better.
[01:18:32.540 --> 01:18:35.220]   I'd watch it for like 15 minutes and just go, I can't.
[01:18:35.220 --> 01:18:35.780]   I couldn't.
[01:18:35.780 --> 01:18:36.460]   I don't think--
[01:18:36.460 --> 01:18:38.980]   It's felt more boring than it actually is,
[01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:41.020]   which is hard to do with baseball.
[01:18:41.020 --> 01:18:42.620]   Well, the thing is is that with a great--
[01:18:42.620 --> 01:18:45.660]   the thing about baseball is it lives on the commentators
[01:18:45.660 --> 01:18:47.740]   because it is not moving very fast.
[01:18:47.740 --> 01:18:49.580]   And when you have a great baseball commentator,
[01:18:49.580 --> 01:18:51.540]   it's a lot of fun to watch because they're adding context.
[01:18:51.540 --> 01:18:51.980]   They're adding--
[01:18:51.980 --> 01:18:53.940]   And you're learning about Wertle, exactly.
[01:18:53.940 --> 01:18:55.860]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:18:55.860 --> 01:18:59.420]   But when you don't have good commentators,
[01:18:59.420 --> 01:19:01.340]   it's pretty painful to--
[01:19:01.340 --> 01:19:03.060]   And notable about this is that they
[01:19:03.060 --> 01:19:05.820]   have hired some of the highest profile soccer commentators.
[01:19:05.820 --> 01:19:08.060]   Of course, now granted, they don't have jobs anymore,
[01:19:08.060 --> 01:19:08.340]   right?
[01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:10.780]   Because all TV is now going to be done on Apple.
[01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:13.060]   All the MLS TV is on Apple's platform.
[01:19:13.060 --> 01:19:15.420]   But they have hired a bunch of high profile people
[01:19:15.420 --> 01:19:18.740]   and the people I know who are in the know about the great local
[01:19:18.740 --> 01:19:21.380]   broadcasters that a lot of them have been picked up here.
[01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:23.820]   But the larger question is exactly what
[01:19:23.820 --> 01:19:25.940]   I would interpret Alex's statement as, which
[01:19:25.940 --> 01:19:28.180]   is a great thing about baseball, especially
[01:19:28.180 --> 01:19:29.860]   is that you have local announcers.
[01:19:29.860 --> 01:19:32.220]   And I would say to Alex about Apple's announcers
[01:19:32.220 --> 01:19:35.140]   that if you listen to any national baseball broadcast,
[01:19:35.140 --> 01:19:37.220]   you will find it shocking how bad the announcers are.
[01:19:37.220 --> 01:19:38.780]   It's not just Apple's broadcast.
[01:19:38.780 --> 01:19:43.020]   The midweek MLB network game, some of the off brand ESPN games,
[01:19:43.020 --> 01:19:45.380]   Sunday Night Baseball, really bad announcing, actually.
[01:19:45.380 --> 01:19:47.940]   There's a lot of bad national announcing to go along.
[01:19:47.940 --> 01:19:51.140]   The problem with MLS is there isn't any local announcing.
[01:19:51.140 --> 01:19:52.660]   There are, what, 30 teams.
[01:19:52.660 --> 01:19:55.340]   And so 15 games per match.
[01:19:55.340 --> 01:19:57.500]   And they're going to have 15 announcing sets
[01:19:57.500 --> 01:19:59.740]   for English language and Spanish.
[01:19:59.740 --> 01:20:02.500]   So basically, everybody's--
[01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:04.020]   and they're not going to be tied to teams
[01:20:04.020 --> 01:20:05.220]   because the teams all move around.
[01:20:05.220 --> 01:20:06.900]   They're going to be a little bit regionally locked.
[01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:08.780]   There'll be some more West Coast announcers and East Coast
[01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:09.460]   announcers.
[01:20:09.460 --> 01:20:12.620]   But what that means is if you're a fan of a team,
[01:20:12.620 --> 01:20:15.180]   you're not going to get a regular announcer every week.
[01:20:15.180 --> 01:20:15.900]   You're not.
[01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:17.820]   You're going to get one of the national announcers
[01:20:17.820 --> 01:20:20.060]   assigned to you just as it is in the NFL.
[01:20:20.060 --> 01:20:22.380]   And it'll be interesting to see how fans react to that.
[01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:24.820]   Because NFL fans don't seem to mind it.
[01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:27.700]   Major League Baseball fans are really, really minded.
[01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:29.660]   And I don't know how that'll play out for Apple.
[01:20:29.660 --> 01:20:31.500]   But the bottom line is they are going to do it.
[01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:33.420]   And they're going to have English and Spanish and every game.
[01:20:33.420 --> 01:20:35.620]   And all the Canadian games will also have a French track,
[01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:36.700]   which is awesome.
[01:20:36.700 --> 01:20:38.980]   Well, and I think that one of the challenges
[01:20:38.980 --> 01:20:40.460]   with national football for it--
[01:20:40.460 --> 01:20:42.900]   I mean, US football, American football, or whatever--
[01:20:42.900 --> 01:20:46.700]   is that they do have really good national announcers
[01:20:46.700 --> 01:20:49.100]   because they're paying them an insane amount of money.
[01:20:49.100 --> 01:20:51.060]   And they're actually--
[01:20:51.060 --> 01:20:52.500]   it falls off really fast.
[01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:53.740]   And I know that people aren't happy with--
[01:20:53.740 --> 01:20:55.540]   The fourth CBS announcing team is here.
[01:20:55.540 --> 01:20:56.540]   Yeah, I have to say.
[01:20:56.540 --> 01:20:57.060]   Yeah.
[01:20:57.060 --> 01:20:57.820]   No, I'm saying this.
[01:20:57.820 --> 01:20:59.340]   I've seen some of what I was going to say.
[01:20:59.340 --> 01:21:01.340]   Bad.
[01:21:01.340 --> 01:21:06.500]   It's-- in my opinion, there's like three
[01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:08.420]   crews in national football.
[01:21:08.420 --> 01:21:09.420]   Yeah.
[01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:11.580]   And if it's not the Steelers, it has
[01:21:11.580 --> 01:21:14.180]   to be one of those three crews, or I'm not going to watch.
[01:21:14.180 --> 01:21:17.700]   It's the Thursday night football team,
[01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:20.860]   the Sunday night football team, and wherever Tony Romo is.
[01:21:20.860 --> 01:21:22.980]   For me, I know people complain about it,
[01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:24.260]   but I sure do love listening to him.
[01:21:24.260 --> 01:21:25.260]   No, I like him.
[01:21:25.260 --> 01:21:26.820]   He knows what he's talking about.
[01:21:26.820 --> 01:21:30.500]   And the Manning brothers, if you don't give them any hosts.
[01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:33.340]   And I think that what Jason was talking about,
[01:21:33.340 --> 01:21:35.420]   I think that that is the thing that people are missing,
[01:21:35.420 --> 01:21:39.780]   is the magic of ESPN is failing on that model.
[01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:41.420]   But they're slowly figuring this out.
[01:21:41.420 --> 01:21:43.140]   And you're slowly getting rid of all--
[01:21:43.140 --> 01:21:45.100]   they're slowly getting rid of all the other guests
[01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:46.900]   and letting the Manning brothers just do their thing,
[01:21:46.900 --> 01:21:51.060]   watching football, two geeky brothers who actually
[01:21:51.060 --> 01:21:54.380]   played football for years, and at a high level
[01:21:54.380 --> 01:21:56.300]   in talking to each other and letting them just
[01:21:56.300 --> 01:21:58.700]   do inside football the whole time.
[01:21:58.700 --> 01:22:00.420]   And hopefully MLS can get to a point
[01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:03.300]   where there's a stream, because the best part of HLS
[01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:05.700]   streaming is that I can put a whole bunch of tracks in there.
[01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:07.380]   Like, I can sit there and just go,
[01:22:07.380 --> 01:22:10.260]   hey, we're going to take two of the ducks and put them in there
[01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:11.900]   and let them just watch the game and talk.
[01:22:11.900 --> 01:22:13.540]   And that can just be another track.
[01:22:13.540 --> 01:22:16.020]   And it's in the grand scheme of the cost of production.
[01:22:16.020 --> 01:22:16.700]   It's very low.
[01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:18.300]   To let someone sit there and watch a feed
[01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:20.620]   and talk about it while they're doing it.
[01:22:20.620 --> 01:22:22.540]   And so I think that they could innovate in a lot of ways
[01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:25.700]   that you can't in national broadcast, where you could have--
[01:22:25.700 --> 01:22:27.300]   I mean, you could have the beginners one,
[01:22:27.300 --> 01:22:28.500]   where they explain to you everything
[01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:30.580]   that you're watching, and what does this mean?
[01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:33.020]   And they could have the geeky one, where they're
[01:22:33.020 --> 01:22:35.340]   only talking about the stats.
[01:22:35.340 --> 01:22:36.340]   Statcast.
[01:22:36.340 --> 01:22:37.180]   Statcast.
[01:22:37.180 --> 01:22:40.500]   Or you could literally probably put up
[01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:43.460]   and have one stream that's a corner of how you score.
[01:22:43.460 --> 01:22:45.180]   Use the score thing on the program.
[01:22:45.180 --> 01:22:47.740]   And when I was a kid, and that was my life,
[01:22:47.740 --> 01:22:48.900]   was that little--
[01:22:48.900 --> 01:22:52.260]   It's the only way to watch baseball is to score along
[01:22:52.260 --> 01:22:53.940]   with the game.
[01:22:53.940 --> 01:22:55.900]   Otherwise, you drift off to sleep.
[01:22:55.900 --> 01:22:57.300]   You're a hot dog.
[01:22:57.300 --> 01:22:58.340]   There's hot dogs.
[01:22:58.340 --> 01:22:58.940]   There's cheering.
[01:22:58.940 --> 01:22:59.700]   There's fear.
[01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:01.180]   Yeah, but I got a problem, because I always
[01:23:01.180 --> 01:23:04.500]   get mustard and relish on my scorecard, and it's just a mess.
[01:23:04.500 --> 01:23:07.260]   You know, something that they're doing with soccer
[01:23:07.260 --> 01:23:08.780]   that I hope they do with baseball, too,
[01:23:08.780 --> 01:23:11.860]   is with the MLS matches and the relationship's different.
[01:23:11.860 --> 01:23:15.420]   But the local radio broadcast of the whole team
[01:23:15.420 --> 01:23:16.180]   will be--
[01:23:16.180 --> 01:23:16.620]   Oh, it's the best.
[01:23:16.620 --> 01:23:17.860]   --seimal cast.
[01:23:17.860 --> 01:23:18.940]   And so will they do that?
[01:23:18.940 --> 01:23:21.300]   I would love to see them make a deal with MLB,
[01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:22.460]   where they're allowed to do that.
[01:23:22.460 --> 01:23:23.140]   I wish they would.
[01:23:23.140 --> 01:23:26.540]   They're broadcast, too, so you can watch their announcers.
[01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:28.980]   I think the fear is that nobody will watch their announcers,
[01:23:28.980 --> 01:23:29.180]   then.
[01:23:29.180 --> 01:23:32.500]   They will all say, show me my local radio broadcast instead.
[01:23:32.500 --> 01:23:34.220]   But at least they'll still be watching Apple TV.
[01:23:34.220 --> 01:23:35.460]   Maybe that's all that matters.
[01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:37.780]   And again, the geeky part of it is,
[01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:41.700]   I went to a game with someone who trains players,
[01:23:41.700 --> 01:23:45.300]   trains baseball players, when they're in high school
[01:23:45.300 --> 01:23:47.500]   and before they go to college.
[01:23:47.500 --> 01:23:50.300]   And watching someone used to be a pro player.
[01:23:50.300 --> 01:23:53.900]   And watching him, he'd go, oh, he's going to try to hit--
[01:23:53.900 --> 01:23:56.940]   he's going to try to pull it, watch where he's putting his foot.
[01:23:56.940 --> 01:23:59.060]   And then now the pitcher has to make a decision
[01:23:59.060 --> 01:24:01.020]   about how they're going to-- whether they're going
[01:24:01.020 --> 01:24:03.460]   to throw a slider to the outside or whether they're--
[01:24:03.460 --> 01:24:06.140]   there's this where the batter wants to put his foot
[01:24:06.140 --> 01:24:07.940]   and whether he's bluffing and whether he's doing it.
[01:24:07.940 --> 01:24:10.660]   And for him, the whole game is very complicated
[01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:11.860]   and happening all the time.
[01:24:11.860 --> 01:24:14.340]   And you're watching all the shifts and all the things.
[01:24:14.340 --> 01:24:16.700]   But we never see any of that because the announcer's never--
[01:24:16.700 --> 01:24:18.380]   most of the announcers never played baseball.
[01:24:18.380 --> 01:24:19.660]   No, they don't know what they're looking--
[01:24:19.660 --> 01:24:21.540]   they know the stats and they know the basics of it.
[01:24:21.540 --> 01:24:23.780]   But they're not watching as a baseball player sitting there
[01:24:23.780 --> 01:24:25.700]   going, when he moves his hips that way,
[01:24:25.700 --> 01:24:27.740]   that's what he wants to do.
[01:24:27.740 --> 01:24:30.540]   I'll just say, Alex, the best announcers know all that stuff.
[01:24:30.540 --> 01:24:32.020]   The best announcers know all that stuff.
[01:24:32.020 --> 01:24:33.020]   I just don't hear them.
[01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:36.060]   They're not-- you don't have to be a jock to be a good answer.
[01:24:36.060 --> 01:24:38.060]   Maybe it helps, but you don't have to be.
[01:24:38.060 --> 01:24:39.020]   I just haven't heard it.
[01:24:39.020 --> 01:24:40.420]   Like, I hear it from players.
[01:24:40.420 --> 01:24:41.780]   I just don't hear it from announcers.
[01:24:41.780 --> 01:24:42.820]   But maybe I don't watch it.
[01:24:42.820 --> 01:24:46.420]   I don't watch it on Facebook because the pirates aren't very good.
[01:24:46.420 --> 01:24:49.180]   Yeah, so that's always my fear that I
[01:24:49.180 --> 01:24:51.860]   think that Apple could do a whole bunch of wonderful things
[01:24:51.860 --> 01:24:57.020]   to innovate, how a sports broadcaster are put out there.
[01:24:57.020 --> 01:24:58.620]   But it really comes-- you can't lose
[01:24:58.620 --> 01:25:01.180]   side of the fact that great sports broadcasting,
[01:25:01.180 --> 01:25:03.260]   it's about great storytelling.
[01:25:03.260 --> 01:25:04.900]   It doesn't matter if you've got the ability
[01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:07.140]   to choose whatever angle you want,
[01:25:07.140 --> 01:25:09.580]   or if, hey, we're going to make sure that instead of one or two
[01:25:09.580 --> 01:25:11.340]   announcers, there are going to be 100 announcers.
[01:25:11.340 --> 01:25:13.740]   You can always choose which one is screaming
[01:25:13.740 --> 01:25:15.740]   that you like the best.
[01:25:15.740 --> 01:25:18.820]   I hope that any good sports channel
[01:25:18.820 --> 01:25:20.860]   is going to make sure that they're developing the talent
[01:25:20.860 --> 01:25:23.620]   inside that booth, those teams of people
[01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:27.420]   that everyone in that booth has something to contribute.
[01:25:27.420 --> 01:25:29.180]   And just as you say, even if it's--
[01:25:29.180 --> 01:25:33.340]   even in the former catcher who doesn't necessarily speak
[01:25:33.340 --> 01:25:36.260]   all the time, but the time that he does speak,
[01:25:36.260 --> 01:25:39.900]   he says, oh, you can see that Wellington is trying
[01:25:39.900 --> 01:25:41.060]   to increase the strike zone.
[01:25:41.060 --> 01:25:43.900]   He usually has very, very good luck
[01:25:43.900 --> 01:25:45.500]   with this particular umpire.
[01:25:45.500 --> 01:25:47.300]   And I think that we're going to see a pitching change
[01:25:47.300 --> 01:25:48.060]   because of it.
[01:25:48.060 --> 01:25:50.780]   All that sort of stuff where I had no idea that was going on.
[01:25:50.780 --> 01:25:53.780]   I thought there was just grown men, grown millionaires,
[01:25:53.780 --> 01:25:55.100]   throwing balls at each other.
[01:25:55.100 --> 01:25:57.540]   And instead, there's this real operatic passion
[01:25:57.540 --> 01:26:02.580]   play going on of lies, deceit, deception, mistrust.
[01:26:02.580 --> 01:26:04.220]   And yeah, that's the sort of thing
[01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:05.620]   that you need to invest in, people
[01:26:05.620 --> 01:26:08.500]   who are really great storytellers, not just people who
[01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:11.540]   know when to switch the camera.
[01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:15.020]   Matt, you panzerino got an interview
[01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:17.740]   with Apple's vice president of platform architecture
[01:26:17.740 --> 01:26:19.220]   and hardware technologies.
[01:26:19.220 --> 01:26:22.180]   Tim Mallet, as well as VP of worldwide product marketing,
[01:26:22.180 --> 01:26:25.620]   Bob Borchers about the Apple M series chips.
[01:26:25.620 --> 01:26:26.420]   I tried.
[01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:27.620]   I really did try to read it.
[01:26:27.620 --> 01:26:30.460]   But I'm hoping one of you actually got all the way through it
[01:26:30.460 --> 01:26:32.260]   and found something of interest.
[01:26:32.260 --> 01:26:34.420]   Was there anything interesting?
[01:26:34.420 --> 01:26:35.620]   A lot.
[01:26:35.620 --> 01:26:39.820]   My favorite part was a long discussion about max and gaming,
[01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:42.140]   which I thought was very forthright,
[01:26:42.140 --> 01:26:46.460]   in that there were pointed questions about if Apple is ever
[01:26:46.460 --> 01:26:48.980]   going to be a really attractive target for AAA gaming,
[01:26:48.980 --> 01:26:51.860]   which is always, I mean, as I think as almost as long
[01:26:51.860 --> 01:26:54.060]   as I've been covering Apple, I mean,
[01:26:54.060 --> 01:26:55.660]   Dark Castle was a big hit.
[01:26:55.660 --> 01:26:58.020]   OK, Harrier Strike, another really big hit,
[01:26:58.020 --> 01:27:00.060]   Shuffle Pluck Cafe, another big hit.
[01:27:00.060 --> 01:27:03.500]   After that, the Mac has had a really long dry stretch.
[01:27:03.500 --> 01:27:04.420]   You're playing game.
[01:27:04.420 --> 01:27:05.580]   That was good.
[01:27:05.580 --> 01:27:06.060]   There you go.
[01:27:06.060 --> 01:27:09.420]   Glad you're glad these are all.
[01:27:09.420 --> 01:27:11.780]   But Apple has had such a hard time
[01:27:11.780 --> 01:27:13.900]   making the Mac into an attractive platform.
[01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:17.300]   And so there was a long conversation about very, again,
[01:27:17.300 --> 01:27:19.980]   very forthright about how we know that we're not
[01:27:19.980 --> 01:27:22.300]   going to be able to turn this around very quickly.
[01:27:22.300 --> 01:27:26.380]   We think that with Metal 3 and with what we're doing
[01:27:26.380 --> 01:27:29.220]   with the M1 series, that we're trying to convince--
[01:27:29.220 --> 01:27:32.020]   we're trying to get developers to understand
[01:27:32.020 --> 01:27:34.580]   what an opportunity the Mac is now as a platform.
[01:27:34.580 --> 01:27:37.940]   Just the idea of having combined video RAM,
[01:27:37.940 --> 01:27:43.820]   having a graphics GPU that has 96 gigabytes of RAM,
[01:27:43.820 --> 01:27:46.220]   that could be interesting on the Mac Pro
[01:27:46.220 --> 01:27:49.220]   to develop for, and even on a smaller scale
[01:27:49.220 --> 01:27:52.300]   with the iMacs and stuff like that.
[01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:55.100]   Because I would love to be--
[01:27:55.100 --> 01:27:57.460]   I'm not in the position where I think
[01:27:57.460 --> 01:28:01.140]   I can justify $500 for a really good game console.
[01:28:01.140 --> 01:28:04.020]   And I'm certainly not going to spend $2,000 on a Windows
[01:28:04.020 --> 01:28:05.020]   gaming machine.
[01:28:05.020 --> 01:28:10.420]   But if my new M2 Mac Mini were able to play--
[01:28:10.420 --> 01:28:13.620]   we were able to play some of these really great top tier
[01:28:13.620 --> 01:28:17.220]   games at a level that would be at the same level as a $2,000
[01:28:17.220 --> 01:28:21.020]   gaming PC, maybe I would spend $70 on something
[01:28:21.020 --> 01:28:23.820]   like the new Red Dead Redemption on--
[01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:26.220]   this sort of stuff would get me interested in it.
[01:28:26.220 --> 01:28:27.700]   And it's a big, big problem trying
[01:28:27.700 --> 01:28:29.860]   to get these developers to understand that, no, this
[01:28:29.860 --> 01:28:30.900]   is not a barren wasteland.
[01:28:30.900 --> 01:28:32.180]   There's actually money to be made.
[01:28:32.180 --> 01:28:34.620]   Please come make money on our platform.
[01:28:34.620 --> 01:28:37.420]   Yeah, I thought it was interesting that they made it clear
[01:28:37.420 --> 01:28:40.900]   that when they designed the chips originally for iOS,
[01:28:40.900 --> 01:28:43.380]   they weren't building any of those capabilities in.
[01:28:43.380 --> 01:28:46.180]   Because you're not going to do them on a phone.
[01:28:46.180 --> 01:28:48.100]   But now that they're on the desktop,
[01:28:48.100 --> 01:28:51.700]   that might be the biggest distinction between the A15 and A14
[01:28:51.700 --> 01:28:56.020]   for iPhone versus the M1 or M2 for the Mac
[01:28:56.020 --> 01:28:58.940]   is that they are putting more energy into GPU design
[01:28:58.940 --> 01:29:00.500]   and metal and so forth.
[01:29:00.500 --> 01:29:02.980]   It didn't sound like-- maybe I missed it--
[01:29:02.980 --> 01:29:06.420]   they were talking to partners about, let's say,
[01:29:06.420 --> 01:29:09.580]   AMD about making discrete graphics,
[01:29:09.580 --> 01:29:12.660]   that they really wanted to make Apple graphics be the way
[01:29:12.660 --> 01:29:13.020]   to go.
[01:29:13.020 --> 01:29:14.820]   Was that right?
[01:29:14.820 --> 01:29:15.820]   Yeah.
[01:29:15.820 --> 01:29:17.140]   Yeah, go ahead.
[01:29:17.140 --> 01:29:18.140]   Go ahead.
[01:29:18.140 --> 01:29:19.860]   It's just it's been architected that way
[01:29:19.860 --> 01:29:21.540]   from the beginning, the amount of effort
[01:29:21.540 --> 01:29:26.980]   that they would need to do to add non-Apple GPU stuff onto a Mac
[01:29:26.980 --> 01:29:29.540]   Pro, basically.
[01:29:29.540 --> 01:29:31.780]   They might do it, but it would be a huge amount of effort.
[01:29:31.780 --> 01:29:34.180]   And it would really require a rethink of some of the stuff.
[01:29:34.180 --> 01:29:36.100]   And the question is, would you do all that
[01:29:36.100 --> 01:29:39.380]   to rethink your processor architecture for the Mac Pro,
[01:29:39.380 --> 01:29:41.940]   which is the nichest of what is already a niche product,
[01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:44.060]   the Mac, and Apple's overall revenue, right?
[01:29:44.060 --> 01:29:45.420]   I think that's the challenge there.
[01:29:45.420 --> 01:29:46.860]   I think it's more likely that they
[01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:50.340]   might do something where there's an add-on card that
[01:29:50.340 --> 01:29:51.940]   adds a bunch of Apple GPUs.
[01:29:51.940 --> 01:29:54.380]   But it's-- yeah, the whole gaming thing,
[01:29:54.380 --> 01:29:55.780]   like Apple's never gotten gaming.
[01:29:55.780 --> 01:29:57.900]   When Apple's been successful, gaming and Andy knows this,
[01:29:57.900 --> 01:29:59.140]   going back way back.
[01:29:59.140 --> 01:30:00.780]   And when Apple's been successful with gaming,
[01:30:00.780 --> 01:30:03.180]   it's been by accident because they built hardware
[01:30:03.180 --> 01:30:05.100]   that people have wanted to play games on,
[01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:07.540]   and that's what happened with the iPhone and the App Store.
[01:30:07.540 --> 01:30:10.940]   And so-- and at this point, I feel like it's been so long
[01:30:10.940 --> 01:30:13.020]   that we can talk about games on the Mac.
[01:30:13.020 --> 01:30:15.500]   But the truth is, Apple just uses games on the Mac
[01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:18.020]   as a proxy to talk about their GPU performance.
[01:30:18.020 --> 01:30:20.020]   And there aren't-- I mean, nobody is--
[01:30:20.020 --> 01:30:23.660]   yes, you can play Resident Evil, the latest version,
[01:30:23.660 --> 01:30:25.420]   Resident Evil Village on the Mac.
[01:30:25.420 --> 01:30:26.700]   And it looks great.
[01:30:26.700 --> 01:30:29.580]   But that is also a two, three-year-old game.
[01:30:29.580 --> 01:30:31.140]   And it's like the one.
[01:30:31.140 --> 01:30:32.420]   And the rest don't exist.
[01:30:32.420 --> 01:30:35.580]   And it's because that ship has sailed.
[01:30:35.580 --> 01:30:36.220]   That's just it.
[01:30:36.220 --> 01:30:38.300]   So Apple just uses that as-- it's good for marketing.
[01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:40.300]   And you see it in the iPhone demos, right?
[01:30:40.300 --> 01:30:43.220]   It's a good proxy for their GPU prowess when the fact is,
[01:30:43.220 --> 01:30:47.380]   most people are not playing Super Rev 3D role-playing games
[01:30:47.380 --> 01:30:48.140]   on their iPhone.
[01:30:48.140 --> 01:30:49.500]   They're playing casual games.
[01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:52.540]   But it's useful for Apple to have that--
[01:30:52.540 --> 01:30:54.020]   to show off.
[01:30:54.020 --> 01:30:56.460]   And I think that Apple-- it would behoove Apple
[01:30:56.460 --> 01:30:58.740]   to really think-- and this is in a couple different layers
[01:30:58.740 --> 01:31:00.940]   of really look at what Epic's doing with the MegaGrants
[01:31:00.940 --> 01:31:03.700]   and think about how they could incentivize
[01:31:03.700 --> 01:31:08.060]   to do some tests, not even create a whole game.
[01:31:08.060 --> 01:31:11.180]   There's a pretty weak point, in my opinion,
[01:31:11.180 --> 01:31:13.940]   in gaming in that they're not very--
[01:31:13.940 --> 01:31:16.340]   I get that esports feels really big,
[01:31:16.340 --> 01:31:18.780]   but it's still really small.
[01:31:18.780 --> 01:31:21.380]   And part of it is because it's too geeky.
[01:31:21.380 --> 01:31:25.380]   Our local high schools, Petaluma High and Casa Grande,
[01:31:25.380 --> 01:31:29.860]   just announced esports teams are playing Mario Kart
[01:31:29.860 --> 01:31:34.180]   that will be on a par with their baseball and football teams.
[01:31:34.180 --> 01:31:36.380]   When you look at the real numbers of users
[01:31:36.380 --> 01:31:37.740]   and real numbers of viewers, I mean,
[01:31:37.740 --> 01:31:41.700]   they can fill a stadium, but can they do that in 27 cities
[01:31:41.700 --> 01:31:44.100]   every week reliably and probably not?
[01:31:44.100 --> 01:31:47.700]   And so the thing is, is that it's still a very, very small
[01:31:47.700 --> 01:31:48.700]   and undeveloped market.
[01:31:48.700 --> 01:31:50.460]   And part of the problem is, is that most of the games
[01:31:50.460 --> 01:31:51.940]   are too complex to watch.
[01:31:51.940 --> 01:31:56.020]   And so it's just too many things going on, too many places.
[01:31:56.020 --> 01:31:57.260]   You don't know where you are.
[01:31:57.260 --> 01:31:59.820]   The camera work is really horrible.
[01:31:59.820 --> 01:32:03.060]   There's a whole bunch of things that could be a lot better.
[01:32:03.060 --> 01:32:04.980]   And Apple could innovate in those areas
[01:32:04.980 --> 01:32:08.860]   and really press down on it and probably using,
[01:32:08.860 --> 01:32:10.380]   because there's things you can do with that GPU
[01:32:10.380 --> 01:32:13.180]   and that CPU that would make them competitive
[01:32:13.180 --> 01:32:14.540]   if they took full advantage of them
[01:32:14.540 --> 01:32:16.580]   and funding things that would actually do that
[01:32:16.580 --> 01:32:17.780]   would be pretty interesting.
[01:32:17.780 --> 01:32:21.340]   But it's not, it's not, it's a market that could be taken
[01:32:21.340 --> 01:32:23.660]   away from the relatively small market
[01:32:23.660 --> 01:32:24.740]   that it is right now.
[01:32:24.740 --> 01:32:28.300]   - You know, we all know that famously Apple
[01:32:28.300 --> 01:32:31.180]   has hired filmmakers just beyond staff at Apple
[01:32:31.180 --> 01:32:32.900]   to use the tools of the developing
[01:32:32.900 --> 01:32:34.460]   so they get a better eye on what's working,
[01:32:34.460 --> 01:32:36.940]   what's not, what's, what they need to go for,
[01:32:36.940 --> 01:32:38.740]   what they need to abandon.
[01:32:38.740 --> 01:32:40.940]   You think that they have a couple of game developers
[01:32:40.940 --> 01:32:43.660]   on board that are just doing that same sort of thing
[01:32:43.660 --> 01:32:46.300]   that we need to understand how game developers
[01:32:46.300 --> 01:32:48.940]   are pressing the hardware and what's not working?
[01:32:48.940 --> 01:32:50.660]   - I don't think you want game developers.
[01:32:50.660 --> 01:32:51.860]   Like I think that's the problem.
[01:32:51.860 --> 01:32:54.020]   Like the problem is people from the inside
[01:32:54.020 --> 01:32:57.260]   constantly making things that aren't going to be scalable.
[01:32:57.260 --> 01:32:58.500]   Like, you know, and so the thing is,
[01:32:58.500 --> 01:33:00.620]   is that what you want is to get some folks
[01:33:00.620 --> 01:33:02.540]   from regular, regular boards,
[01:33:02.540 --> 01:33:04.700]   talking to people who develop games
[01:33:04.700 --> 01:33:06.700]   and build something that is like football
[01:33:06.700 --> 01:33:09.700]   or baseball or soccer, not those games,
[01:33:09.700 --> 01:33:12.260]   but something that is in a much more open space.
[01:33:12.260 --> 01:33:16.260]   The problem is it's not very viewable.
[01:33:16.260 --> 01:33:17.900]   Like, you know, and so the thing is,
[01:33:17.900 --> 01:33:19.900]   it's viewable for the people who are into the game.
[01:33:19.900 --> 01:33:21.180]   It's just not viewable for--
[01:33:21.180 --> 01:33:22.100]   - I didn't mean it's an audience thing.
[01:33:22.100 --> 01:33:22.940]   I just met--
[01:33:22.940 --> 01:33:23.780]   - But I think the problem--
[01:33:23.780 --> 01:33:26.580]   - Again, I think that we know what pushes those things
[01:33:26.580 --> 01:33:29.260]   is the problem is is that the game development themselves,
[01:33:29.260 --> 01:33:30.620]   you're not gonna get something new
[01:33:30.620 --> 01:33:32.140]   until you find somebody that's outside
[01:33:32.140 --> 01:33:33.700]   of that going back in.
[01:33:33.700 --> 01:33:36.700]   You know, and I don't know if Apple found that,
[01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:38.580]   they have the money to actually drive that in
[01:33:38.580 --> 01:33:41.420]   and build it so that it takes full advantage
[01:33:41.420 --> 01:33:42.500]   of the hardware.
[01:33:42.500 --> 01:33:43.340]   Like, if you have a--
[01:33:43.340 --> 01:33:44.660]   you could have something that would--
[01:33:44.660 --> 01:33:46.860]   you could have something because of the way the iOS
[01:33:46.860 --> 01:33:49.220]   and blends into Mac OS,
[01:33:49.220 --> 01:33:52.140]   you could have something that can be played on a phone
[01:33:52.140 --> 01:33:54.460]   and it takes full advantage of an ultra phone
[01:33:54.460 --> 01:33:56.460]   or whatever they want,
[01:33:56.460 --> 01:34:01.020]   and can be played on a Mac Pro that is totally decked out
[01:34:01.020 --> 01:34:04.100]   and it will suck up every ounce of processing power
[01:34:04.100 --> 01:34:05.540]   in both ends.
[01:34:05.540 --> 01:34:07.700]   You know, and you could build something like that
[01:34:07.700 --> 01:34:09.540]   and make it viewable and if Apple did something like that,
[01:34:09.540 --> 01:34:10.740]   they would be able to--
[01:34:10.740 --> 01:34:12.380]   I'm gonna, they would be able to do something
[01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:13.860]   that was new and different.
[01:34:13.860 --> 01:34:15.460]   They're not gonna be able to do,
[01:34:15.460 --> 01:34:17.980]   they can't do more of the same
[01:34:17.980 --> 01:34:19.500]   and expect to ever have any impact.
[01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:20.820]   They're gonna have to disrupt the market
[01:34:20.820 --> 01:34:23.140]   with something else if they care.
[01:34:23.140 --> 01:34:24.500]   I don't know about the cars.
[01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:26.460]   - Yeah, I just meant in the sense,
[01:34:26.460 --> 01:34:28.380]   not in the sense of actually making a product
[01:34:28.380 --> 01:34:30.540]   or even necessarily making a demo,
[01:34:30.540 --> 01:34:32.820]   but the fact that again, they have filmmakers
[01:34:32.820 --> 01:34:35.540]   that whose job is not necessarily just to make Apple
[01:34:35.540 --> 01:34:38.820]   training videos and Apple marketing videos,
[01:34:38.820 --> 01:34:41.100]   but also we want someone who actually does this
[01:34:41.100 --> 01:34:44.100]   for a living who's entered this company only two, three years ago
[01:34:44.100 --> 01:34:47.500]   to use our products, to use early editions of our products
[01:34:47.500 --> 01:34:50.660]   to really, to be the first people to tell us
[01:34:50.660 --> 01:34:53.420]   how much our editing software stinks
[01:34:53.420 --> 01:34:55.580]   before an actual paying customer does.
[01:34:55.580 --> 01:34:59.620]   So I just suddenly just thought that
[01:34:59.620 --> 01:35:01.540]   even if they don't have, this is not something
[01:35:01.540 --> 01:35:03.420]   they're gonna be putting into Apple Arcade or something,
[01:35:03.420 --> 01:35:04.980]   if they had a couple of game developers
[01:35:04.980 --> 01:35:09.980]   who are ready to have a regular nine to five job salary,
[01:35:09.980 --> 01:35:12.340]   not be fired at the end of every crunch cycle
[01:35:12.340 --> 01:35:15.860]   and simply say, build games that will necessarily
[01:35:15.860 --> 01:35:19.020]   not be released, but you will tell us
[01:35:19.020 --> 01:35:22.540]   what the bottlenecks are in our graphics pipeline.
[01:35:22.540 --> 01:35:24.860]   You will tell us where Xcode is falling short.
[01:35:24.860 --> 01:35:26.500]   You're telling us where, my God,
[01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:27.620]   if I were just doing this,
[01:35:27.620 --> 01:35:30.740]   if I were doing this for any other graphics target,
[01:35:30.740 --> 01:35:33.300]   this would be so easy, why are you making this so hard?
[01:35:33.300 --> 01:35:34.660]   - Well, the hard part is figuring out
[01:35:34.660 --> 01:35:37.660]   how big of the market it is that would be doing it
[01:35:37.660 --> 01:35:40.780]   because the filmmakers, as someone who's done this,
[01:35:40.780 --> 01:35:45.620]   I mean, I was complaining to someone
[01:35:45.620 --> 01:35:49.020]   about the fact that when I recorded uncompressed
[01:35:49.020 --> 01:35:51.060]   444 foot, this is 10 years ago,
[01:35:51.060 --> 01:35:53.140]   I was more than 10 years, 15 years ago,
[01:35:53.140 --> 01:35:56.700]   I'm like, I'm recording uncompressed 444 footage
[01:35:56.700 --> 01:35:59.980]   into my Mac through Final Cut Pro,
[01:35:59.980 --> 01:36:03.020]   and I'm dropping frames every X number,
[01:36:03.020 --> 01:36:04.540]   and literally what came back was,
[01:36:04.540 --> 01:36:06.340]   you're the only person in the world doing that.
[01:36:06.340 --> 01:36:07.180]   (laughing)
[01:36:07.180 --> 01:36:08.060]   So make sure your development time
[01:36:08.060 --> 01:36:10.820]   is probably gonna be very low because it's not a very large,
[01:36:10.820 --> 01:36:12.900]   we don't see that as a large addressable market.
[01:36:12.900 --> 01:36:15.060]   And it was just flat, it was someone being flat with me,
[01:36:15.060 --> 01:36:16.900]   like we're not probably not gonna fix that problem.
[01:36:16.900 --> 01:36:19.580]   And it was an eye opener for me
[01:36:19.580 --> 01:36:20.900]   'cause I had to think through that lens,
[01:36:20.900 --> 01:36:22.700]   and I was just doing something in keynote
[01:36:22.700 --> 01:36:24.500]   and I thought of this cool animation
[01:36:24.500 --> 01:36:25.340]   that I wanted in keynote
[01:36:25.340 --> 01:36:26.660]   and I started trying to build it in keynote.
[01:36:26.660 --> 01:36:29.620]   I built a pretty complex set of animations with keynote,
[01:36:29.620 --> 01:36:30.860]   but then there was all these things missing,
[01:36:30.860 --> 01:36:31.980]   and I was like, I'm gonna send Apple
[01:36:31.980 --> 01:36:35.460]   like a whole slew of feedback things and explain exactly
[01:36:35.460 --> 01:36:36.460]   what I'm trying to do, and I was like,
[01:36:36.460 --> 01:36:37.900]   who else is a Birkner?
[01:36:37.900 --> 01:36:39.060]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:36:39.060 --> 01:36:41.140]   - You know, like, you know, so I think that's always
[01:36:41.140 --> 01:36:43.860]   the hard part when you have even filmmakers talking to Apple.
[01:36:43.860 --> 01:36:45.420]   It's like they want a bunch of things from Final Cut,
[01:36:45.420 --> 01:36:47.540]   but the question is, does that really,
[01:36:47.540 --> 01:36:49.980]   what will 90% of the market do 90% of the time?
[01:36:49.980 --> 01:36:51.700]   Is it kind of Apple's sweet spot?
[01:36:51.700 --> 01:36:53.940]   - One other thing, and maybe I'm just reading
[01:36:53.940 --> 01:36:56.140]   between the lines in this panzerino interview,
[01:36:56.140 --> 01:36:59.700]   but I got the sense, maybe Jason, you've kind of said this,
[01:36:59.700 --> 01:37:02.140]   so maybe you can confirm whether this is what you read
[01:37:02.140 --> 01:37:05.260]   out of it too, that they released the M2 only
[01:37:05.260 --> 01:37:07.460]   because they felt like they kind of had to keep up
[01:37:07.460 --> 01:37:09.420]   a year to year cadence.
[01:37:09.420 --> 01:37:12.020]   He said, Millet said, "To make sure people didn't see
[01:37:12.020 --> 01:37:15.020]   "the M1 as a one and done."
[01:37:15.020 --> 01:37:18.740]   Kind of implying that, yeah, we know the M2 isn't a big jump,
[01:37:18.740 --> 01:37:22.580]   but we gotta put it out, and I don't know,
[01:37:22.580 --> 01:37:26.020]   I'm thinking maybe next year, it's the M3
[01:37:26.020 --> 01:37:29.260]   that we should be looking for a big jump.
[01:37:29.260 --> 01:37:31.220]   Did you get that sense?
[01:37:31.220 --> 01:37:32.460]   - Yeah, reading between the lines,
[01:37:32.460 --> 01:37:36.380]   and I've interviewed Tim Millet a bunch of times,
[01:37:36.380 --> 01:37:38.100]   and he's a really forthcoming guy, actually,
[01:37:38.100 --> 01:37:40.100]   he's more forthcoming than I think Apple PR
[01:37:40.100 --> 01:37:41.860]   would like him to be sometimes,
[01:37:41.860 --> 01:37:43.980]   but, and he's a straight shooter, I would say,
[01:37:43.980 --> 01:37:45.740]   and very enthusiastic about what Apple has done
[01:37:45.740 --> 01:37:49.460]   with its chips, and yes, reading between the lines here,
[01:37:49.460 --> 01:37:52.420]   part of it is, what makes this unique is,
[01:37:52.420 --> 01:37:55.540]   it's the second one, and so we're doing it again, right?
[01:37:55.540 --> 01:37:59.620]   And yet, you do get the feeling like maybe M3,
[01:37:59.620 --> 01:38:01.460]   and we've talked about it here before,
[01:38:01.460 --> 01:38:04.700]   maybe M3 is where they move, they sort of leapfrog
[01:38:04.700 --> 01:38:07.020]   one generation of iPhone chips,
[01:38:07.020 --> 01:38:08.700]   and it's got a whole bunch of new stuff in it,
[01:38:08.700 --> 01:38:11.900]   and the M2 is more just to keep the trains running,
[01:38:11.900 --> 01:38:14.140]   keep the ball rolling, and honestly,
[01:38:14.140 --> 01:38:16.700]   if you're inside Apple, I would imagine,
[01:38:16.700 --> 01:38:19.500]   it's hard to get super excited about the M2
[01:38:19.500 --> 01:38:22.220]   when you probably are working on like the M5, right?
[01:38:22.220 --> 01:38:24.220]   - You know, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:38:24.220 --> 01:38:26.220]   - So, and you know that the M3 is the one
[01:38:26.220 --> 01:38:28.100]   that's really hot, the M2 is okay,
[01:38:28.100 --> 01:38:31.060]   but like, I think it's safe to say that, you know,
[01:38:31.060 --> 01:38:34.420]   the M2 exists in part to just make everybody understand
[01:38:34.420 --> 01:38:36.700]   Apple's in this, they're gonna keep making these chips,
[01:38:36.700 --> 01:38:37.780]   they're gonna keep getting better,
[01:38:37.780 --> 01:38:39.380]   and like, well, I know we did it once,
[01:38:39.380 --> 01:38:41.180]   but we gotta show you that we're committed,
[01:38:41.180 --> 01:38:43.660]   and we're still gonna be here, and yeah, it's incremental,
[01:38:43.660 --> 01:38:46.460]   but yeah, if I were him, I probably wouldn't be that excited
[01:38:46.460 --> 01:38:48.980]   about it, 'cause I suspect that there are bigger things
[01:38:48.980 --> 01:38:50.860]   coming down the road.
[01:38:50.860 --> 01:38:52.740]   - We reported, of course, last week
[01:38:52.740 --> 01:38:56.540]   that Evans Hanky was leaving Apple after three years
[01:38:56.540 --> 01:38:59.060]   as design head she took over for Johnny Ive.
[01:38:59.060 --> 01:39:01.820]   Now, from Mark Gurman comes the story,
[01:39:01.820 --> 01:39:04.260]   Apple is not gonna replace her,
[01:39:04.260 --> 01:39:06.140]   that the team of industrial designers
[01:39:06.140 --> 01:39:07.940]   will just report to Jeff Williams,
[01:39:07.940 --> 01:39:09.700]   as chief operating officer,
[01:39:09.700 --> 01:39:14.700]   and there will be no longer will be a design chief role.
[01:39:14.700 --> 01:39:18.620]   That's to me kind of interesting, if true,
[01:39:18.620 --> 01:39:22.620]   is do you think Apple is burned, feels a little burned,
[01:39:22.620 --> 01:39:24.900]   by the Johnny Ive era, and saying yeah,
[01:39:24.900 --> 01:39:27.340]   we gave Johnny way too much power,
[01:39:27.340 --> 01:39:29.580]   maybe we don't need somebody in charge
[01:39:29.580 --> 01:39:31.580]   with that kind of power,
[01:39:31.580 --> 01:39:33.460]   maybe Jeff could just run this team.
[01:39:33.460 --> 01:39:35.620]   Any thoughts, Andy?
[01:39:35.620 --> 01:39:36.820]   - Feels so-- - Go ahead,
[01:39:36.820 --> 01:39:38.420]   you can start, Jason.
[01:39:38.420 --> 01:39:40.940]   - As somebody who used to manage a bunch of people,
[01:39:40.940 --> 01:39:42.500]   it feels to me like this is a situation
[01:39:42.500 --> 01:39:43.500]   where two things are happening.
[01:39:43.500 --> 01:39:47.660]   One is Johnny I've left, and he left with a lot of his people,
[01:39:47.660 --> 01:39:49.540]   and so I think that there maybe was a brain drain
[01:39:49.540 --> 01:39:50.580]   inside this organization.
[01:39:50.580 --> 01:39:52.540]   Evan's hanky stepped up and said,
[01:39:52.540 --> 01:39:53.900]   "I'll do it for a while,"
[01:39:53.900 --> 01:39:55.980]   and then she's like, "I don't wanna do this anymore."
[01:39:55.980 --> 01:39:57.540]   And when they make this thing where they're like,
[01:39:57.540 --> 01:39:59.100]   they're gonna elevate some of the leaders
[01:39:59.100 --> 01:40:00.980]   in the design group to run the groups,
[01:40:00.980 --> 01:40:02.780]   and then they're all gonna report to Jeff Williams,
[01:40:02.780 --> 01:40:05.500]   like Jeff Williams doesn't want all these designers reporting
[01:40:05.500 --> 01:40:07.220]   to him, he totally doesn't want that.
[01:40:07.220 --> 01:40:10.940]   But so the way I read it is not that this is some sort of,
[01:40:10.940 --> 01:40:13.300]   I mean, it could be, but it's unlikely to me
[01:40:13.300 --> 01:40:14.300]   that this is some sort of scheme
[01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:16.860]   where it's operations taking control of the design department,
[01:40:16.860 --> 01:40:20.220]   feels to be more like they didn't have a candidate
[01:40:20.220 --> 01:40:22.100]   to be the number one on the inside.
[01:40:22.100 --> 01:40:23.780]   They don't wanna hire on the outside for this.
[01:40:23.780 --> 01:40:26.220]   This is not the kind of job you hire from the outside
[01:40:26.220 --> 01:40:27.980]   to be designer at Apple.
[01:40:27.980 --> 01:40:29.940]   Design lead at Apple, it just doesn't happen.
[01:40:29.940 --> 01:40:32.060]   It would have to be a former Apple person coming back
[01:40:32.060 --> 01:40:33.140]   for that to work at all.
[01:40:33.140 --> 01:40:35.420]   And I just, I immediately saw this and thought
[01:40:35.420 --> 01:40:37.540]   they don't have somebody who's a clear number one
[01:40:37.540 --> 01:40:39.820]   who stepped forward, and they've got a bunch of people
[01:40:39.820 --> 01:40:41.220]   they may actually be afraid to lose
[01:40:41.220 --> 01:40:43.780]   if they promote one of them because they're a group of peers.
[01:40:43.780 --> 01:40:46.460]   So we're just gonna let it ride,
[01:40:46.460 --> 01:40:48.420]   we're gonna give those more senior people
[01:40:48.420 --> 01:40:50.460]   a little more authority over their teams.
[01:40:50.460 --> 01:40:52.540]   We're gonna say it reports to Jeff.
[01:40:52.540 --> 01:40:54.740]   And Jeff is probably like designers.
[01:40:54.740 --> 01:40:56.820]   I don't wanna talk to you
[01:40:56.820 --> 01:40:58.260]   'cause he doesn't want a bunch of designers.
[01:40:58.260 --> 01:41:00.180]   - No, he's really, he really doesn't.
[01:41:00.180 --> 01:41:01.020]   - He really does. - He really does.
[01:41:01.020 --> 01:41:03.700]   Anointed successor, he's the operations guy.
[01:41:03.700 --> 01:41:06.460]   He's the supply chain guy.
[01:41:06.460 --> 01:41:09.300]   And so this isn't, this is exactly who you don't wanna
[01:41:09.300 --> 01:41:11.580]   run design if you want a good design.
[01:41:11.580 --> 01:41:13.540]   But as German points out,
[01:41:13.540 --> 01:41:16.580]   Apple still has some veterans from the I-Vira,
[01:41:16.580 --> 01:41:18.940]   including Molly Anderson, Duncan Kerr,
[01:41:18.940 --> 01:41:21.020]   Bart Andre, Richard Haworth,
[01:41:21.020 --> 01:41:22.780]   Peter Russell, Clark, and Ben Schafer.
[01:41:22.780 --> 01:41:24.620]   I think you nailed it when you said Apple didn't wanna
[01:41:24.620 --> 01:41:26.460]   take one of them and put them in charge
[01:41:26.460 --> 01:41:27.940]   'cause the others would go screw that.
[01:41:27.940 --> 01:41:28.940]   - Right.
[01:41:28.940 --> 01:41:30.820]   And then you've got an even worse brain drain
[01:41:30.820 --> 01:41:32.100]   than you already have with Johnny I
[01:41:32.100 --> 01:41:33.820]   of taking so many people with him when he left.
[01:41:33.820 --> 01:41:37.020]   - I think that sounds exactly right.
[01:41:37.020 --> 01:41:40.340]   Haworth was briefly the head of industrial design
[01:41:40.340 --> 01:41:43.020]   between 2015 and 2017 while I was still there,
[01:41:43.020 --> 01:41:44.980]   but just not as involved.
[01:41:44.980 --> 01:41:49.980]   And German says he struggled to manage a crew of former peers.
[01:41:49.980 --> 01:41:54.380]   He's been in Apple for 30 years.
[01:41:54.380 --> 01:41:58.580]   I think that makes a lot of sense that you trust these guys.
[01:41:58.580 --> 01:42:01.380]   I don't know if you really want Jeff Williams to be saying,
[01:42:01.380 --> 01:42:03.420]   you know, this should be a lighter shade of,
[01:42:03.420 --> 01:42:06.260]   a paler shade of blue, but you know, maybe--
[01:42:06.260 --> 01:42:08.380]   - And in the background, maybe you're keeping an eye on them
[01:42:08.380 --> 01:42:10.660]   and saying like one of them will step forward.
[01:42:10.660 --> 01:42:12.340]   And you could down the road in a few years,
[01:42:12.340 --> 01:42:14.260]   you could promote them to do this.
[01:42:14.260 --> 01:42:17.300]   But like there is, if you're Apple and you're in this situation
[01:42:17.300 --> 01:42:18.980]   where you can't hire from outside
[01:42:18.980 --> 01:42:21.580]   and there's nobody who you could really promote
[01:42:21.580 --> 01:42:24.380]   or if there is somebody who would be a little shaky
[01:42:24.380 --> 01:42:27.220]   or the other three or four senior people would quit,
[01:42:27.220 --> 01:42:28.060]   then what do you do?
[01:42:28.060 --> 01:42:28.980]   And the answer is you do this.
[01:42:28.980 --> 01:42:31.220]   So I don't know for sure that this is what's going on here,
[01:42:31.220 --> 01:42:34.100]   but from the outside that sure feels like what's going on here.
[01:42:34.100 --> 01:42:35.260]   - Yeah.
[01:42:35.260 --> 01:42:36.980]   And that makes sense.
[01:42:36.980 --> 01:42:39.700]   I guess I have to say I think they probably felt
[01:42:39.700 --> 01:42:41.380]   a little burned by the Johnny I of Europe
[01:42:41.380 --> 01:42:43.020]   where Johnny got more and more power,
[01:42:43.020 --> 01:42:45.900]   including over not just industrial design, but software and so forth.
[01:42:45.900 --> 01:42:49.060]   - Well, maybe you should want to go that way again.
[01:42:49.060 --> 01:42:53.420]   - I think that Johnny Ives, Johnny Ives was checked by Steve.
[01:42:53.420 --> 01:42:54.340]   You know, Steve would, you know, like--
[01:42:54.340 --> 01:42:56.420]   - Right, they had somebody to keep an eye on them.
[01:42:56.420 --> 01:42:58.420]   - There was a yin and yang.
[01:42:58.420 --> 01:43:01.900]   And then when half of that went away,
[01:43:01.900 --> 01:43:04.460]   he just kind of kept spiraling up
[01:43:04.460 --> 01:43:06.780]   because there was no one there that he respected enough
[01:43:06.780 --> 01:43:08.220]   to really get checked by.
[01:43:08.220 --> 01:43:09.380]   - I think that was probably--
[01:43:09.380 --> 01:43:12.060]   - In case you're curious, Johnny though is keeping busy,
[01:43:12.060 --> 01:43:15.060]   he's just recently designed a new clown nose
[01:43:15.060 --> 01:43:17.620]   for Comic Relief, Red Nose Day.
[01:43:17.620 --> 01:43:20.580]   It's a flat pack design.
[01:43:20.580 --> 01:43:24.100]   - I'm not kidding.
[01:43:24.100 --> 01:43:24.940]   - That works great.
[01:43:24.940 --> 01:43:28.020]   - Yeah, it's largely made of paper and it folds out,
[01:43:28.020 --> 01:43:32.220]   but it does fold back into a small case for Red Nose Day,
[01:43:32.220 --> 01:43:33.220]   which I was told over--
[01:43:33.220 --> 01:43:34.380]   - No, no, Red Nose Day is.
[01:43:34.380 --> 01:43:38.340]   - Oh well, Comic Relief benefits many charities.
[01:43:38.340 --> 01:43:41.700]   It was started in the US, but apparently I was told
[01:43:41.700 --> 01:43:43.620]   by Will Harris who was on Twitter on Sunday,
[01:43:43.620 --> 01:43:45.900]   it's become huge in the UK.
[01:43:45.900 --> 01:43:48.660]   You know, just as on Memorial Day you see,
[01:43:48.660 --> 01:43:50.060]   or as a veteran, no Memorial Day,
[01:43:50.060 --> 01:43:52.180]   you see the red poppies everywhere.
[01:43:52.180 --> 01:43:55.500]   Apparently, a lot of people walk around with red noses
[01:43:55.500 --> 01:44:00.500]   on March 17th, and if you are really in the know,
[01:44:00.500 --> 01:44:06.020]   you'll have this Johnny Ive designed special red nose.
[01:44:06.020 --> 01:44:08.540]   - And you can't, and they're sold out.
[01:44:08.540 --> 01:44:09.780]   You used to be able to buy them off.
[01:44:09.780 --> 01:44:11.500]   I was on UK, but you cannot.
[01:44:11.500 --> 01:44:13.620]   - Did you try to buy his red nose?
[01:44:13.620 --> 01:44:15.100]   - I did try to buy the red nose.
[01:44:15.100 --> 01:44:18.140]   Like it's a Johnny Ive designed product
[01:44:18.140 --> 01:44:20.740]   that I can actually afford, two pounds 50, I got that.
[01:44:20.740 --> 01:44:22.340]   I can do that.
[01:44:22.340 --> 01:44:24.620]   Yeah, it looked pretty cool too.
[01:44:24.620 --> 01:44:27.140]   And also do a YouTube search for Red Nose Day
[01:44:27.140 --> 01:44:29.660]   because a lot of comedians, like a lot of actors
[01:44:29.660 --> 01:44:32.500]   like bring old characters out of retirement
[01:44:32.500 --> 01:44:35.380]   and basically get the band back together
[01:44:35.380 --> 01:44:37.300]   and do new comedy for Red Nose Day.
[01:44:37.300 --> 01:44:38.860]   - It's a very big deal.
[01:44:38.860 --> 01:44:41.700]   And last year they raised in the UK alone,
[01:44:41.700 --> 01:44:46.700]   42.8 million pounds for a variety of good causes.
[01:44:46.700 --> 01:44:49.260]   So that's cool, that's cool.
[01:44:49.260 --> 01:44:52.820]   - By the way, about Johnny having too much power,
[01:44:52.820 --> 01:44:56.620]   I will say that Apple benefited, after Steve died,
[01:44:56.620 --> 01:45:00.620]   Apple used Johnny and his high profile
[01:45:00.620 --> 01:45:03.740]   and kept him to stay and kept giving him power
[01:45:03.740 --> 01:45:07.220]   because they didn't want the double whammy
[01:45:07.220 --> 01:45:08.740]   of losing Steve and then losing Johnny.
[01:45:08.740 --> 01:45:12.540]   So it's not all, like Johnny, I think if you read that book
[01:45:12.540 --> 01:45:14.500]   that came out by Tripp Michael, like,
[01:45:14.500 --> 01:45:16.940]   Johnny kind of was done, right?
[01:45:16.940 --> 01:45:19.140]   And they're like, no, no, Johnny, you can work at home,
[01:45:19.140 --> 01:45:21.940]   you can go to England, you can be in charge of software,
[01:45:21.940 --> 01:45:23.660]   you can make a car, you can, you know,
[01:45:23.660 --> 01:45:25.500]   we'll give you money, just please stay.
[01:45:25.500 --> 01:45:27.540]   And they did that for a while and they're finally like,
[01:45:27.540 --> 01:45:30.020]   all right, okay, we, enough time has passed,
[01:45:30.020 --> 01:45:31.300]   we'll let you go.
[01:45:31.300 --> 01:45:35.380]   And so they're kind of undoing some of that stuff now too.
[01:45:35.380 --> 01:45:37.980]   - Yeah, I think that's really positive
[01:45:37.980 --> 01:45:40.180]   when you find that you have a,
[01:45:40.180 --> 01:45:42.660]   such a senior role that is now vacant
[01:45:42.660 --> 01:45:44.860]   and then you realize that we don't need that
[01:45:44.860 --> 01:45:47.260]   to be that role at that level anymore.
[01:45:47.260 --> 01:45:48.820]   We don't need to have someone reporting directly
[01:45:48.820 --> 01:45:51.220]   to the CEO on design.
[01:45:51.220 --> 01:45:53.260]   We can actually just have a bunch of people
[01:45:53.260 --> 01:45:55.420]   that are working both collaboratively
[01:45:55.420 --> 01:45:57.620]   and individually on projects as needed.
[01:45:57.620 --> 01:46:01.860]   That's a sign of a really well-run company
[01:46:01.860 --> 01:46:04.140]   when you simply, 'cause you know how that government
[01:46:04.140 --> 01:46:05.420]   bureaucracy is, that is,
[01:46:05.420 --> 01:46:09.060]   when the pushback against the development
[01:46:09.060 --> 01:46:10.740]   of any new government agency,
[01:46:10.740 --> 01:46:12.180]   no matter how important it is,
[01:46:12.180 --> 01:46:14.460]   is that once their mission is over with,
[01:46:14.460 --> 01:46:16.420]   it will not be possible to shut this down
[01:46:16.420 --> 01:46:18.460]   'cause that's not how governments work.
[01:46:18.460 --> 01:46:19.460]   People protect their budgets.
[01:46:19.460 --> 01:46:20.740]   The fact that Apple simply said,
[01:46:20.740 --> 01:46:22.780]   you know what, we're just not gonna refill this position.
[01:46:22.780 --> 01:46:24.500]   Where this position is no longer necessary.
[01:46:24.500 --> 01:46:25.900]   That's really good for Apple.
[01:46:25.900 --> 01:46:27.620]   - Yeah, I'm sure that Jeff Williams would like,
[01:46:27.620 --> 01:46:29.940]   ultimately there to be somebody as a head
[01:46:29.940 --> 01:46:32.340]   of our hardware design to go with Alan Dye
[01:46:32.340 --> 01:46:33.340]   as they had a software design,
[01:46:33.340 --> 01:46:36.460]   just because, again, I think if you're Jeff Williams,
[01:46:36.460 --> 01:46:39.500]   having more direct reports is not what you want, right?
[01:46:39.500 --> 01:46:41.420]   Like, I think we've all,
[01:46:41.420 --> 01:46:43.220]   anybody who worked in a corporate structure knows
[01:46:43.220 --> 01:46:45.060]   when they hand you a bunch of new direct reports
[01:46:45.060 --> 01:46:47.460]   and you're like, what, what, why?
[01:46:47.460 --> 01:46:49.500]   So I'm sure Jeff Williams doesn't want them,
[01:46:49.500 --> 01:46:51.260]   but like, clearly they don't have one now.
[01:46:51.260 --> 01:46:53.420]   I don't think anybody is ever gonna be exalted on the eye,
[01:46:53.420 --> 01:46:55.900]   right, reports to the CEO can do whatever he wants.
[01:46:55.900 --> 01:46:57.220]   Like, that's not gonna happen.
[01:46:57.220 --> 01:47:00.540]   But I wouldn't be surprised if in the next three or four years
[01:47:00.540 --> 01:47:03.020]   they do identify somebody in that group and say,
[01:47:03.020 --> 01:47:07.340]   okay, this person's a leader and then they are ready for that,
[01:47:07.340 --> 01:47:08.820]   but they're clearly not ready for it now.
[01:47:08.820 --> 01:47:09.660]   - So here we are.
[01:47:09.660 --> 01:47:11.740]   - And I just wanna point out, Andy,
[01:47:11.740 --> 01:47:14.020]   that you can get a red nose on eBay.
[01:47:14.020 --> 01:47:17.620]   Just you might wanna go right now for $10.80
[01:47:17.620 --> 01:47:19.580]   get the official.
[01:47:19.580 --> 01:47:21.620]   - Oh, I don't got $10.80.
[01:47:21.620 --> 01:47:23.620]   (laughing)
[01:47:23.620 --> 01:47:26.660]   - Especially the, especially the cart macroeconomic exchange
[01:47:26.660 --> 01:47:28.820]   right now. - Yeah, head wins.
[01:47:28.820 --> 01:47:30.900]   - Head wins. - The head wins.
[01:47:30.900 --> 01:47:33.100]   - Well, you know, it's a little harder to brace those head wins
[01:47:33.100 --> 01:47:34.500]   when you're wearing a big red nose.
[01:47:34.500 --> 01:47:37.180]   So, and somebody pointed out that March 17th
[01:47:37.180 --> 01:47:38.460]   is also St. Patrick's Day.
[01:47:38.460 --> 01:47:40.740]   So many will get their red noses for free.
[01:47:40.740 --> 01:47:43.900]   So, you know, it's works as a win-win all around.
[01:47:43.900 --> 01:47:46.420]   If you are on eBay, you might wanna bid
[01:47:46.420 --> 01:47:49.540]   on some old Apple crap.
[01:47:49.540 --> 01:47:53.540]   Quite a bit of old Apple crap, as a matter of fact.
[01:47:53.540 --> 01:47:58.540]   Retro computing website, Vintage Apple is selling
[01:47:58.780 --> 01:48:03.780]   its entire collection, 500 items on eBay,
[01:48:03.780 --> 01:48:08.380]   including leases.
[01:48:08.380 --> 01:48:10.300]   Be nice to get that in the 40th anniversary,
[01:48:10.300 --> 01:48:14.060]   accelerators, compact Macs, complete working system,
[01:48:14.060 --> 01:48:18.700]   CRTs, printers, yes, laser writers, power books,
[01:48:18.700 --> 01:48:20.020]   and more.
[01:48:20.020 --> 01:48:22.580]   It's on eBay, there's a full listing.
[01:48:22.580 --> 01:48:25.700]   If you're in the market for some old Apple crap,
[01:48:25.700 --> 01:48:27.820]   it's kinda expensive.
[01:48:27.820 --> 01:48:31.180]   I mean, a PowerBook 100 for 160 bucks.
[01:48:31.180 --> 01:48:32.180]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:48:32.180 --> 01:48:35.140]   - Well, they're selling it as individuals, right?
[01:48:35.140 --> 01:48:35.980]   It's a lot.
[01:48:35.980 --> 01:48:39.180]   I've seen the link and the--
[01:48:39.180 --> 01:48:40.820]   - Looks like you can buy individuals.
[01:48:40.820 --> 01:48:43.940]   So for instance, they are selling the Mac Pro,
[01:48:43.940 --> 01:48:45.860]   which I spent a little more than $300
[01:48:45.860 --> 01:48:49.660]   for I think, as I remember, is for $310.
[01:48:49.660 --> 01:48:54.660]   This is a 128 gigabyte, two terabyte, 12 core Apple Mac Pro,
[01:48:55.500 --> 01:48:58.140]   but they have enough of them, I guess.
[01:48:58.140 --> 01:49:01.780]   Well, maybe is this the same sale that's in the listing?
[01:49:01.780 --> 01:49:03.820]   Looks like you can configure it.
[01:49:03.820 --> 01:49:09.140]   I gave mine to Nathan Oliveris Giles, so I don't know.
[01:49:09.140 --> 01:49:11.700]   Maybe he's selling his.
[01:49:11.700 --> 01:49:15.860]   This looks like a massive lot of vintage Mac stuff.
[01:49:15.860 --> 01:49:17.940]   Oh, wait a minute, you're right.
[01:49:17.940 --> 01:49:18.860]   Wait a minute, you're right.
[01:49:18.860 --> 01:49:20.420]   These were similar items.
[01:49:20.420 --> 01:49:22.980]   No, you're right, they're selling the whole thing
[01:49:22.980 --> 01:49:25.420]   for $12,000.
[01:49:25.420 --> 01:49:30.120]   And you gotta do free local pickup in Santa Barbara.
[01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:33.820]   And it looks like they weren't able to sell it, actually,
[01:49:33.820 --> 01:49:35.980]   'cause as the auction has ended.
[01:49:35.980 --> 01:49:42.700]   - Yeah, there's too much funniness going on
[01:49:42.700 --> 01:49:43.900]   with the used Apple market.
[01:49:43.900 --> 01:49:46.420]   Now that you have middle-aged people
[01:49:46.420 --> 01:49:50.340]   who no longer have to support their kids,
[01:49:50.340 --> 01:49:52.500]   they're now like, "Ooh, I'm gonna reassemble
[01:49:52.500 --> 01:49:57.500]   "that Mac SE30 that I used to have."
[01:49:57.500 --> 01:50:00.820]   And yeah, I mean, these things are basically,
[01:50:00.820 --> 01:50:02.420]   they're sold to the millions,
[01:50:02.420 --> 01:50:04.780]   they're almost certainly gonna require a lot of work,
[01:50:04.780 --> 01:50:06.740]   get them work actually functioning again.
[01:50:06.740 --> 01:50:08.300]   And you can just go to archive.org
[01:50:08.300 --> 01:50:10.460]   and rerun all that old software.
[01:50:10.460 --> 01:50:11.300]   - I don't know who it is. - I don't know who it is.
[01:50:11.300 --> 01:50:12.220]   - I'm gonna go through it for free.
[01:50:12.220 --> 01:50:13.860]   - You gotta drive to Santa Barbara to pick it up.
[01:50:13.860 --> 01:50:17.060]   They have re-listed it, the starting bid is 11,000 still.
[01:50:17.060 --> 01:50:21.900]   Although the buy it now price of a mere $15,500
[01:50:21.900 --> 01:50:24.140]   is a pretty good deal if you wanna get a whole bunch.
[01:50:24.140 --> 01:50:26.180]   - It just comes so much to store that stuff.
[01:50:26.180 --> 01:50:28.340]   - That's why he's selling it, right?
[01:50:28.340 --> 01:50:31.100]   - I used to have a lot more stuff than I used to.
[01:50:31.100 --> 01:50:33.980]   Like after years and years, they might T-Flee market.
[01:50:33.980 --> 01:50:36.380]   And I just had, I was spending so much money
[01:50:36.380 --> 01:50:38.900]   just to keep this in stores that I realized that,
[01:50:38.900 --> 01:50:40.900]   you know what, I could just like get,
[01:50:40.900 --> 01:50:44.020]   throw out all of it, rebuy anything that I want
[01:50:44.020 --> 01:50:45.780]   if I ever think of it in the next 10 years
[01:50:45.780 --> 01:50:47.420]   and I won't make money back on the deal.
[01:50:47.420 --> 01:50:48.260]   - Yeah.
[01:50:48.260 --> 01:50:49.500]   And don't bother contacting him and saying,
[01:50:49.500 --> 01:50:52.020]   "Well, I'd take that daisy wheel off your hands."
[01:50:52.020 --> 01:50:53.580]   He says, "I'm not selling it individually,
[01:50:53.580 --> 01:50:56.420]   "just as you said, Andy, it's all or nothing."
[01:50:56.420 --> 01:50:57.900]   (laughing)
[01:50:57.900 --> 01:51:00.300]   Boy, he was a pack rat.
[01:51:00.300 --> 01:51:02.340]   Look at all this stuff.
[01:51:02.340 --> 01:51:03.420]   Holy cow.
[01:51:03.420 --> 01:51:05.180]   - Yeah, see that's, again,
[01:51:05.180 --> 01:51:06.620]   there's so many collections like this
[01:51:06.620 --> 01:51:09.060]   because there's so many years in which like,
[01:51:09.060 --> 01:51:12.380]   anything in the classic Mac and the classic Mac form factor,
[01:51:12.380 --> 01:51:14.980]   there were years the MIT Flee market work.
[01:51:14.980 --> 01:51:17.620]   It came down to, if someone had 10 of them
[01:51:17.620 --> 01:51:21.020]   and you offered them $5 for the lot, you could take them.
[01:51:21.020 --> 01:51:22.380]   And that was most--
[01:51:22.380 --> 01:51:23.220]   - Take them off the Mac.
[01:51:23.220 --> 01:51:24.060]   - Yeah.
[01:51:24.060 --> 01:51:24.900]   - Exactly.
[01:51:24.900 --> 01:51:27.740]   I just want, I don't have to deal with like recycling a CRT,
[01:51:27.740 --> 01:51:29.300]   they're taking too much room.
[01:51:29.300 --> 01:51:31.780]   I have a child now, I have responsibilities,
[01:51:31.780 --> 01:51:33.460]   I'm a grownup now.
[01:51:33.460 --> 01:51:35.500]   And now I think that's, you're seeing a lot of people
[01:51:35.500 --> 01:51:37.180]   that were able to scoop up these things for,
[01:51:37.180 --> 01:51:39.420]   well, for 10 bucks, yeah, I'll buy that for 10 bucks.
[01:51:39.420 --> 01:51:42.420]   And now you've got this huge, huge garage full of stuff
[01:51:42.420 --> 01:51:45.260]   that you realize now that you don't really enjoy anymore
[01:51:45.260 --> 01:51:46.940]   and it's not giving you any pleasure.
[01:51:46.940 --> 01:51:49.420]   I've only kept like a handful of them,
[01:51:49.420 --> 01:51:52.100]   the ones that I think that are like frog design ones,
[01:51:52.100 --> 01:51:56.420]   like the iMac G3, things that I think are really pretty
[01:51:56.420 --> 01:51:57.340]   in and of themselves.
[01:51:57.340 --> 01:52:01.180]   And I just have them as like ornaments in my house
[01:52:01.180 --> 01:52:02.940]   'cause oh my God, if you decide to say,
[01:52:02.940 --> 01:52:06.820]   I'm gonna get every performer in a big rack
[01:52:06.820 --> 01:52:09.900]   with labels on them, oh my God, how can you afford
[01:52:09.900 --> 01:52:12.220]   to have a library space where you can have all the performers
[01:52:12.220 --> 01:52:14.020]   like stacked up like that, good happens.
[01:52:14.020 --> 01:52:15.420]   - It is safe for internet day.
[01:52:15.420 --> 01:52:18.620]   Today, celebrate as you wish.
[01:52:18.620 --> 01:52:21.780]   Apple has a whole page dedicated to families,
[01:52:21.780 --> 01:52:25.060]   apple.com/families where they talk about all the things
[01:52:25.060 --> 01:52:27.540]   you can do to protect your kids online.
[01:52:27.540 --> 01:52:32.540]   They are also adding some today at Apple classes
[01:52:32.540 --> 01:52:37.660]   for kids and families to talk about being safe online
[01:52:37.660 --> 01:52:38.780]   and so forth.
[01:52:38.780 --> 01:52:40.660]   I think that's a good thing.
[01:52:40.660 --> 01:52:43.740]   So this is a very elaborate page with a lot of stuff.
[01:52:43.740 --> 01:52:46.460]   Also, as long as you're going back to apple.com,
[01:52:46.460 --> 01:52:48.060]   you might know the redesign.
[01:52:48.060 --> 01:52:50.900]   Can you tell me what the redesign is?
[01:52:50.900 --> 01:52:53.780]   Look at this, they got drop down menus.
[01:52:53.780 --> 01:52:58.420]   Okay, how exciting is that, huh?
[01:52:58.420 --> 01:53:01.460]   - No, might not work in Safari, but if you run it in Chrome
[01:53:01.460 --> 01:53:04.660]   then that's all the latest JavaScript standards,
[01:53:04.660 --> 01:53:05.500]   you're good.
[01:53:05.500 --> 01:53:07.060]   - Look at that, look at that.
[01:53:07.060 --> 01:53:08.740]   It runs in Safari, right?
[01:53:08.740 --> 01:53:09.740]   I would hope.
[01:53:09.740 --> 01:53:11.420]   - Well, no, I'm joking, but yeah.
[01:53:11.420 --> 01:53:13.660]   - Yeah, I'm doing it in Firefox and it works.
[01:53:13.660 --> 01:53:15.580]   They want to get your money with one fewer click.
[01:53:15.580 --> 01:53:17.300]   That's smart, that's just marketing.
[01:53:17.300 --> 01:53:19.020]   - Well, in a way, it's kind of as needed
[01:53:19.020 --> 01:53:22.540]   because what you had to do in the past is click on the heading
[01:53:22.540 --> 01:53:24.260]   and then go to that page and drill down.
[01:53:24.260 --> 01:53:26.940]   Now, when you hover over a heading,
[01:53:26.940 --> 01:53:30.060]   you can see all of the things that have to do with Max
[01:53:30.060 --> 01:53:32.940]   and go a little bit faster to the page you want.
[01:53:32.940 --> 01:53:35.740]   - Particular because before you click on iPad
[01:53:35.740 --> 01:53:38.580]   and you'd get the landing page for whatever the latest hottest
[01:53:38.580 --> 01:53:40.300]   iPad is that they were trying to sell you
[01:53:40.300 --> 01:53:41.420]   and it became a little bit difficult.
[01:53:41.420 --> 01:53:44.060]   - No, I thought that there was a, my friend told me
[01:53:44.060 --> 01:53:46.340]   there was a really great one for $499.
[01:53:46.340 --> 01:53:48.060]   What's this thousand dollar iPad pro?
[01:53:48.060 --> 01:53:48.980]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:53:48.980 --> 01:53:54.000]   (humming)
[01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.260]   I guess this might be of interest to you, Alex,
[01:53:56.260 --> 01:53:58.900]   considering your expertise with mid-journey.
[01:53:58.900 --> 01:54:02.180]   The startup that started Stable Diffusion
[01:54:02.180 --> 01:54:06.540]   is launching a generative AI for video.
[01:54:06.540 --> 01:54:07.700]   It's called Gen 1.
[01:54:07.700 --> 01:54:09.380]   - Go ahead.
[01:54:09.380 --> 01:54:11.220]   - Google's got it too.
[01:54:11.220 --> 01:54:13.380]   - Yeah, Google's doing some stuff as well.
[01:54:13.380 --> 01:54:16.100]   So it's definitely, I mean, everybody's doing it.
[01:54:16.100 --> 01:54:17.620]   I mean, most of these companies,
[01:54:17.620 --> 01:54:21.020]   the smaller companies that are going out,
[01:54:21.020 --> 01:54:23.340]   the bigger companies have been working on this for a decade.
[01:54:23.340 --> 01:54:24.260]   They just weren't putting them out
[01:54:24.260 --> 01:54:25.100]   'cause they're pretty good. - Just for toning.
[01:54:25.100 --> 01:54:25.940]   - Yeah.
[01:54:25.940 --> 01:54:27.260]   - And they're afraid to get sued.
[01:54:27.260 --> 01:54:29.900]   And so when everybody else got them out,
[01:54:29.900 --> 01:54:31.940]   it's kind of forced them all into the front.
[01:54:31.940 --> 01:54:33.660]   But Stable Diffusion, I imagine,
[01:54:33.660 --> 01:54:36.100]   we'll see something from, I don't know about mid-journey,
[01:54:36.100 --> 01:54:38.460]   but potential, I mean, obviously some, at some point,
[01:54:38.460 --> 01:54:41.060]   but also open AI will most likely
[01:54:41.060 --> 01:54:41.900]   put something out.
[01:54:41.900 --> 01:54:45.340]   They kind of have a lot of general purpose type solutions.
[01:54:45.340 --> 01:54:48.940]   But I think that the video is gonna be really interesting.
[01:54:48.940 --> 01:54:51.220]   And again, I think that my experience right now
[01:54:51.220 --> 01:54:53.220]   is that I'm not too worried as an artist.
[01:54:53.220 --> 01:54:54.900]   Like, as an artist, I wouldn't worry too much
[01:54:54.900 --> 01:54:56.180]   about all of these things
[01:54:56.180 --> 01:54:58.420]   'cause people are asking you to do something specific,
[01:54:58.420 --> 01:55:01.980]   but if I was doing stock photography or stock video,
[01:55:01.980 --> 01:55:03.900]   I'd be super concerned.
[01:55:03.900 --> 01:55:04.740]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:55:04.740 --> 01:55:06.780]   - Because I'm doing a presentation right now
[01:55:06.780 --> 01:55:09.100]   and I needed a whole bunch of little illustrations
[01:55:09.100 --> 01:55:10.940]   that are just kind of fun.
[01:55:10.940 --> 01:55:12.940]   And in every page I'm using mid-journey.
[01:55:12.940 --> 01:55:15.260]   Like literally like, oh, you know,
[01:55:15.260 --> 01:55:17.100]   and just like these little examples of things
[01:55:17.100 --> 01:55:19.220]   and funny pictures and everything else,
[01:55:19.220 --> 01:55:20.220]   I'm just throwing these all in.
[01:55:20.220 --> 01:55:24.220]   And I used to use, I used to spend like a dock like this,
[01:55:24.220 --> 01:55:27.420]   I would spend $400 on stock photography.
[01:55:27.420 --> 01:55:29.580]   And now I'm spending nothing.
[01:55:29.580 --> 01:55:30.420]   - Yeah.
[01:55:30.420 --> 01:55:32.060]   - You know, and I'm getting better images, you know,
[01:55:32.060 --> 01:55:33.060]   so that's the problem.
[01:55:33.060 --> 01:55:35.380]   - So they apparently, this has been out for a while
[01:55:35.380 --> 01:55:37.940]   because commercial interests have been using it.
[01:55:37.940 --> 01:55:40.460]   They were, it was used to generate video
[01:55:40.460 --> 01:55:42.660]   or you know, motion pictures for everything,
[01:55:42.660 --> 01:55:44.300]   everywhere, all at once.
[01:55:44.300 --> 01:55:48.140]   And the late show used it for their show open and so forth.
[01:55:48.140 --> 01:55:51.240]   So I guess others are using this.
[01:55:51.240 --> 01:55:53.620]   That's interesting.
[01:55:53.620 --> 01:55:54.620]   - And it's still great.
[01:55:54.620 --> 01:55:58.860]   - There's music now, there's stills, there's video.
[01:55:58.860 --> 01:55:59.660]   - I don't know if the good,
[01:55:59.660 --> 01:56:01.740]   but I'm not using it for the animation.
[01:56:01.740 --> 01:56:02.460]   - That's pretty cool.
[01:56:02.460 --> 01:56:03.980]   - Yeah.
[01:56:03.980 --> 01:56:06.980]   - Take a video and turn everybody into claymation.
[01:56:06.980 --> 01:56:07.820]   - Yeah.
[01:56:07.820 --> 01:56:09.740]   - Or make yourself on the moon.
[01:56:10.580 --> 01:56:12.140]   - I thought it was very interesting the way
[01:56:12.140 --> 01:56:14.220]   that the Google system,
[01:56:14.220 --> 01:56:16.820]   you can basically take existing photos.
[01:56:16.820 --> 01:56:18.900]   That's not necessarily that it's gonna animate those photos,
[01:56:18.900 --> 01:56:22.140]   but you use photos to essentially storyboard
[01:56:22.140 --> 01:56:23.140]   what you want them to do.
[01:56:23.140 --> 01:56:27.380]   So if you say, I want the, I want a dinosaur
[01:56:27.380 --> 01:56:30.060]   on the middle of a grassy knoll.
[01:56:30.060 --> 01:56:32.180]   And I want there to be a duck in the horizon
[01:56:32.180 --> 01:56:33.380]   that's moving towards you.
[01:56:33.380 --> 01:56:34.420]   You can basically start with,
[01:56:34.420 --> 01:56:36.780]   well, here's a picture of something on the grass,
[01:56:36.780 --> 01:56:37.860]   on the left.
[01:56:37.860 --> 01:56:40.060]   And it's just a dog, but Google will say,
[01:56:40.060 --> 01:56:41.460]   oh, I know we're going here.
[01:56:41.460 --> 01:56:42.940]   I know that you want, I know what you want.
[01:56:42.940 --> 01:56:45.500]   I can modify this how you want it to go.
[01:56:45.500 --> 01:56:46.340]   - This is pretty cool.
[01:56:46.340 --> 01:56:49.380]   So you have, Alex, I can just imagine you using this
[01:56:49.380 --> 01:56:50.740]   for stuff down the road.
[01:56:50.740 --> 01:56:53.540]   - Yeah, I mean, I think that the video and the audio,
[01:56:53.540 --> 01:56:56.260]   the video music is still pretty early on.
[01:56:56.260 --> 01:56:58.580]   It's a couple of years behind the images and the,
[01:56:58.580 --> 01:57:00.660]   so when I look at it, I'm like, oh, that's fine,
[01:57:00.660 --> 01:57:02.300]   but I don't know what I would do with it.
[01:57:02.300 --> 01:57:04.820]   Like mid-journey and chat, GPT, we know what to do with.
[01:57:04.820 --> 01:57:07.060]   Like, how is this gonna,
[01:57:07.060 --> 01:57:08.500]   it really isn't part of Mac Break Weekly,
[01:57:08.500 --> 01:57:09.740]   but it's, since I got here,
[01:57:09.740 --> 01:57:10.780]   how is this gonna shake out?
[01:57:10.780 --> 01:57:12.220]   Now there are quite a few lawsuits,
[01:57:12.220 --> 01:57:14.460]   Geddy just joined the crowds,
[01:57:14.460 --> 01:57:15.900]   so he can disable the fusion.
[01:57:15.900 --> 01:57:18.380]   This is, the artists who created the originals
[01:57:18.380 --> 01:57:19.420]   are very upset.
[01:57:19.420 --> 01:57:22.180]   - The risk really is losing.
[01:57:22.180 --> 01:57:24.580]   Like if they, you know, so the risk of this,
[01:57:24.580 --> 01:57:25.540]   what's kept everybody out,
[01:57:25.540 --> 01:57:26.620]   wasn't afraid they were gonna get sued.
[01:57:26.620 --> 01:57:29.980]   So the lawsuits are gonna clarify the law.
[01:57:29.980 --> 01:57:32.020]   I think that it's gonna be, you know,
[01:57:32.020 --> 01:57:34.340]   if you put your stuff on the internet,
[01:57:34.340 --> 01:57:38.100]   it's gonna be pretty hard to say that something,
[01:57:38.100 --> 01:57:39.740]   that, you know, that they,
[01:57:39.740 --> 01:57:41.940]   'cause it's not cutting and pasting anything from it.
[01:57:41.940 --> 01:57:43.780]   It's building models the way, you know,
[01:57:43.780 --> 01:57:45.300]   not exactly the way a human would,
[01:57:45.300 --> 01:57:47.340]   but if I was looking at a lot of images,
[01:57:47.340 --> 01:57:50.060]   I would, you know, we, and I think that the testimony
[01:57:50.060 --> 01:57:52.260]   is probably gonna be talking to a lot of artists who say,
[01:57:52.260 --> 01:57:55.180]   well, like, I know when I build something,
[01:57:55.180 --> 01:57:56.140]   I build a vision board.
[01:57:56.140 --> 01:57:57.460]   You know what that vision board is?
[01:57:57.460 --> 01:57:58.940]   It's everybody else's work.
[01:57:58.940 --> 01:58:00.420]   Like it's all this stuff.
[01:58:00.420 --> 01:58:02.740]   What, like, we study, you know, we've had,
[01:58:02.740 --> 01:58:04.500]   I've had people, like, take a commercial
[01:58:04.500 --> 01:58:06.420]   and just break down every shot,
[01:58:06.420 --> 01:58:07.660]   and we look at it and we go,
[01:58:07.660 --> 01:58:09.100]   okay, we like this part, we like that part.
[01:58:09.100 --> 01:58:10.620]   Let's take this part of this, this part of this,
[01:58:10.620 --> 01:58:12.220]   and then we build something on our own
[01:58:12.220 --> 01:58:13.940]   that doesn't look like that commercial,
[01:58:13.940 --> 01:58:16.060]   but we definitely got ideas from that.
[01:58:16.060 --> 01:58:18.420]   And so I think that it's gonna be a hard,
[01:58:18.420 --> 01:58:22.420]   it's gonna be a hard, it's a hard case to win, I think.
[01:58:22.420 --> 01:58:25.140]   Not impossible, definitely could win.
[01:58:25.140 --> 01:58:28.100]   It's a hard case to win, and if they lose, it's over.
[01:58:28.100 --> 01:58:30.340]   Like, as soon as they, if it gets to the Supreme Court
[01:58:30.340 --> 01:58:33.180]   and they lose these lawsuits that they're putting in,
[01:58:33.180 --> 01:58:35.860]   it'll be a trillion dollars the next year of investment
[01:58:35.860 --> 01:58:37.700]   that will just bury everything.
[01:58:37.700 --> 01:58:39.420]   You know, because what's keeping everybody out
[01:58:39.420 --> 01:58:41.460]   is the risk of it, but once that risk is,
[01:58:41.460 --> 01:58:44.260]   once there's precedent, it's gonna be game over.
[01:58:44.260 --> 01:58:45.100]   - Yeah.
[01:58:45.100 --> 01:58:46.740]   Although there was some disruption last year
[01:58:46.740 --> 01:58:48.780]   when Academic Paper got published
[01:58:48.780 --> 01:58:52.020]   that demonstrating that diffusion model-based AI
[01:58:52.020 --> 01:58:55.340]   image generators can actually be tricked
[01:58:55.340 --> 01:58:58.380]   into regenerating source images
[01:58:58.380 --> 01:59:00.300]   or the images that they were trained on.
[01:59:00.300 --> 01:59:05.300]   - So not that I think that this makes this whole system
[01:59:05.300 --> 01:59:10.260]   morally bankrupt, but now if a company did wanna sue,
[01:59:10.260 --> 01:59:11.860]   or if I'm a photographer and I say,
[01:59:11.860 --> 01:59:14.700]   well, I know that my pictures appeared
[01:59:14.700 --> 01:59:18.580]   in that $2.2 billion data set that your diffusion,
[01:59:18.580 --> 01:59:21.180]   your stable diffusion model was trained on.
[01:59:21.180 --> 01:59:23.020]   And I see a picture that was generated
[01:59:23.020 --> 01:59:24.500]   that looks a lot like mine.
[01:59:24.500 --> 01:59:26.180]   Now, guess what, in the court of law,
[01:59:26.180 --> 01:59:29.300]   you're gonna have to prove that your AI
[01:59:29.300 --> 01:59:32.740]   did not actually reassemble my original source.
[01:59:32.740 --> 01:59:35.620]   And just the fact that, even if they can't prove it,
[01:59:35.620 --> 01:59:39.580]   the fact that this makes things in doubt
[01:59:39.580 --> 01:59:41.380]   means that we're really gonna have to spend
[01:59:41.380 --> 01:59:43.380]   a couple of years not just developing the technology,
[01:59:43.380 --> 01:59:46.340]   but having lots of lawsuits and having lots of judges
[01:59:46.340 --> 01:59:50.980]   establish precedence on here's what copyright law,
[01:59:50.980 --> 01:59:53.780]   here's how copyright law applies to generative AI.
[01:59:53.780 --> 01:59:57.860]   Does it apply to Alex who created the prompt for the image?
[01:59:57.860 --> 02:00:00.700]   Does it apply to the AI that actually generated the image?
[02:00:00.700 --> 02:00:03.460]   Does it apply to the $2.2 billion creator,
[02:00:03.460 --> 02:00:06.420]   the $2.2 billion people in the training set?
[02:00:06.420 --> 02:00:08.500]   It's a lot of unanswered questions.
[02:00:08.500 --> 02:00:10.100]   - Usually though, when it's unanswered,
[02:00:10.100 --> 02:00:12.380]   it's hard to get a judge right out of it.
[02:00:12.380 --> 02:00:16.500]   So when it's unknown, like if it's hard to prove,
[02:00:16.500 --> 02:00:18.940]   you more have to prove that they did do it
[02:00:18.940 --> 02:00:21.580]   rather than that they have to prove that they didn't.
[02:00:21.580 --> 02:00:24.140]   So the thing is, is that it is, again,
[02:00:24.140 --> 02:00:26.980]   I'm not saying that it's an unwinnable lawsuit.
[02:00:26.980 --> 02:00:29.740]   Every lawsuit that goes to court is winnable.
[02:00:29.740 --> 02:00:33.380]   And so it's just a very difficult
[02:00:33.380 --> 02:00:37.420]   and very treacherous way to try to get this done.
[02:00:37.420 --> 02:00:39.140]   And if the problem is, again,
[02:00:39.140 --> 02:00:42.740]   there's potentially opportunities to negotiate.
[02:00:42.740 --> 02:00:44.860]   And now that the lawsuits are out,
[02:00:44.860 --> 02:00:45.820]   no one's gonna negotiate,
[02:00:45.820 --> 02:00:47.820]   they're just gonna wait and see what happens.
[02:00:47.820 --> 02:00:50.860]   And I think that tactically it's a little dangerous.
[02:00:50.860 --> 02:00:53.980]   To try to get artists, I think, probably as a whole,
[02:00:53.980 --> 02:00:56.140]   would have done better with trying to find a way
[02:00:56.140 --> 02:00:58.900]   to figure this all out, because now everyone's just gonna wait
[02:00:58.900 --> 02:01:00.220]   and they're gonna see how this turns out.
[02:01:00.220 --> 02:01:05.220]   And the hard part is, is that once it becomes too widely used,
[02:01:05.220 --> 02:01:09.060]   which, 'cause these court cases will take years,
[02:01:09.060 --> 02:01:10.860]   it'll be hard to take it away.
[02:01:10.860 --> 02:01:15.420]   And so it's a complicated mess,
[02:01:15.420 --> 02:01:18.460]   but if they lose, the amount of money
[02:01:18.460 --> 02:01:20.900]   that will go into this will be eye-popping
[02:01:20.900 --> 02:01:23.020]   because everyone's excited about the opportunity.
[02:01:23.020 --> 02:01:27.020]   And once there's cases that have been,
[02:01:27.020 --> 02:01:30.780]   once it's been decided at a high enough court of law,
[02:01:30.780 --> 02:01:32.260]   like no one's gonna talk about,
[02:01:32.260 --> 02:01:33.540]   no one's gonna talk to the artists anymore
[02:01:33.540 --> 02:01:34.660]   about what they feel.
[02:01:34.660 --> 02:01:36.060]   - If they both school the win,
[02:01:36.060 --> 02:01:37.300]   then they have a lot of leverage.
[02:01:37.300 --> 02:01:39.100]   - Both Google and Microsoft now are rolling,
[02:01:39.100 --> 02:01:43.020]   quickly rolling out text-based chat GPT like Google.
[02:01:43.020 --> 02:01:43.860]   - Which they had.
[02:01:43.860 --> 02:01:45.420]   - Apprentice Bard, which they've had for a long time,
[02:01:45.420 --> 02:01:46.860]   is now becoming Bard.
[02:01:46.860 --> 02:01:49.340]   Microsoft announced an event on February 7th,
[02:01:49.340 --> 02:01:50.820]   in which they're going to, I think,
[02:01:50.820 --> 02:01:53.140]   show us what they're gonna do with chat GPT.
[02:01:53.140 --> 02:01:54.460]   - Yeah, it's the Google event.
[02:01:54.460 --> 02:01:56.500]   - I've been trying not to read the recaps of it.
[02:01:56.500 --> 02:01:58.060]   Yeah, the Microsoft event was today.
[02:01:58.060 --> 02:01:58.900]   - Today's the seventh?
[02:01:58.900 --> 02:01:59.740]   - Oh.
[02:01:59.740 --> 02:02:01.900]   (laughing)
[02:02:01.900 --> 02:02:03.380]   - I'm a little behind the times.
[02:02:03.380 --> 02:02:04.220]   - Did you watch it?
[02:02:04.220 --> 02:02:06.420]   - They're calling it, no, I've been trying,
[02:02:06.420 --> 02:02:07.980]   I've been trying not to read it in the show.
[02:02:07.980 --> 02:02:08.820]   - It wasn't the public.
[02:02:08.820 --> 02:02:09.660]   - Yeah.
[02:02:09.660 --> 02:02:11.220]   - Yeah, but the reports that they're calling it
[02:02:11.220 --> 02:02:15.940]   an AI powered co-pilot for the web of in Bing,
[02:02:15.940 --> 02:02:19.260]   and of course I've been under a pin by chat GPT,
[02:02:19.260 --> 02:02:23.700]   and yeah, I'm salivating to read exactly what they're doing.
[02:02:23.700 --> 02:02:25.820]   I don't think it's gonna be as good that the,
[02:02:25.820 --> 02:02:28.580]   I know this, I know this has to be very quick
[02:02:28.580 --> 02:02:32.700]   'cause this is not Google, Microsoft chat GPT show,
[02:02:32.700 --> 02:02:37.340]   but it's like, Google has been sitting on this for years,
[02:02:37.340 --> 02:02:39.180]   they just don't know, they just haven't known
[02:02:39.180 --> 02:02:40.020]   like what to do with it,
[02:02:40.020 --> 02:02:41.740]   if it was safe to know what to do with this.
[02:02:41.740 --> 02:02:43.180]   And so all these reports about how,
[02:02:43.180 --> 02:02:45.540]   oh, Google's getting its lunch eaten by, it's like,
[02:02:45.540 --> 02:02:50.420]   no, they have this garage full of fully armed
[02:02:50.420 --> 02:02:52.260]   and tactical battle stations,
[02:02:52.260 --> 02:02:53.900]   and now they have to figure out which ones
[02:02:53.900 --> 02:02:56.180]   they're gonna charge up and actually deploy.
[02:02:56.180 --> 02:02:58.900]   So this is gonna be a frisky month, I think.
[02:02:58.900 --> 02:02:59.820]   Very frisky month.
[02:02:59.820 --> 02:03:02.780]   - We will watch with interests,
[02:03:02.780 --> 02:03:05.380]   and I might start using Bing, who knows, I don't know.
[02:03:05.380 --> 02:03:07.260]   (laughing)
[02:03:07.260 --> 02:03:09.860]   - That's the kind of thing that could change everything, right?
[02:03:09.860 --> 02:03:12.380]   It's all of a sudden, well, if it stinks,
[02:03:13.900 --> 02:03:16.100]   not GPT, except for very few,
[02:03:16.100 --> 02:03:18.420]   it's been great for a bunch of demos
[02:03:18.420 --> 02:03:21.780]   that's fun to play with when you can actually get access
[02:03:21.780 --> 02:03:24.300]   to it because it's often overwhelmed.
[02:03:24.300 --> 02:03:27.380]   Google, when they had a teaser for what they're talking about
[02:03:27.380 --> 02:03:29.620]   and they're saying that not only is it going to be
[02:03:29.620 --> 02:03:33.460]   very verified, but also they basically slimmed down
[02:03:33.460 --> 02:03:36.420]   their model to make sure that it can handle the load of
[02:03:36.420 --> 02:03:38.900]   everybody basically asking everything everywhere,
[02:03:38.900 --> 02:03:40.180]   all at once, so to speak.
[02:03:40.180 --> 02:03:41.940]   So we'll see how it goes.
[02:03:41.940 --> 02:03:44.660]   - I'll use Bing, but I will not use Edge, so.
[02:03:44.660 --> 02:03:45.500]   (laughing)
[02:03:45.500 --> 02:03:48.220]   - It's gonna make me use Edge than the hell with it.
[02:03:48.220 --> 02:03:49.820]   - We're gonna take a break, come back with your picks
[02:03:49.820 --> 02:03:52.100]   of the weak gentlemen, so prepare them,
[02:03:52.100 --> 02:03:55.100]   while I mention my pick for all of you,
[02:03:55.100 --> 02:04:00.100]   which is to join our club, increasingly important to us
[02:04:00.100 --> 02:04:02.500]   to keep the lights on in our staff employee,
[02:04:02.500 --> 02:04:05.500]   but I think we put together a pretty nice offering
[02:04:05.500 --> 02:04:07.780]   of features for seven bucks a month.
[02:04:07.780 --> 02:04:09.460]   Come on, a couple of cups of coffee.
[02:04:09.460 --> 02:04:11.620]   You get all of our shows ad-free,
[02:04:11.620 --> 02:04:13.220]   you wouldn't even be hearing this
[02:04:13.220 --> 02:04:14.980]   if you were a club twit member.
[02:04:14.980 --> 02:04:17.420]   You get some special stuff that we don't put out
[02:04:17.420 --> 02:04:20.740]   in public, like Micah Sargent's Hands on McIntosh,
[02:04:20.740 --> 02:04:22.340]   Hands on Windows with Paul Thorett.
[02:04:22.340 --> 02:04:24.940]   They do those every week, we occasionally put one or two
[02:04:24.940 --> 02:04:27.380]   of them on YouTube so you can see what it's like,
[02:04:27.380 --> 02:04:29.700]   but if you want the full bore,
[02:04:29.700 --> 02:04:33.740]   you gotta join the club.
[02:04:33.740 --> 02:04:36.300]   We also have the untitled Linux Show with Jonathan Bennett.
[02:04:36.300 --> 02:04:40.460]   We've got the Giz Fizz every Wednesday with Dick D Bartolo.
[02:04:40.460 --> 02:04:41.980]   We've got events coming up in the club,
[02:04:41.980 --> 02:04:43.580]   including on Friday.
[02:04:43.580 --> 02:04:46.420]   I'm gonna interview Daniel Suarez for our triangulation.
[02:04:46.420 --> 02:04:49.180]   Club members will get to ask questions.
[02:04:49.180 --> 02:04:51.780]   There's a lot on the club,
[02:04:51.780 --> 02:04:53.620]   and I think it's a great deal,
[02:04:53.620 --> 02:04:56.260]   especially the fun discord,
[02:04:56.260 --> 02:04:58.820]   which really is a big part of what makes the club so great.
[02:04:58.820 --> 02:05:02.300]   It's a community of like-minded people,
[02:05:02.300 --> 02:05:05.660]   twit fans who are really fun to be around,
[02:05:05.660 --> 02:05:07.300]   and it's not just chats during the shows,
[02:05:07.300 --> 02:05:10.140]   but it's chats in all areas that Geeks would be interested
[02:05:10.140 --> 02:05:10.980]   in.
[02:05:10.980 --> 02:05:12.260]   All of this for seven bucks a month,
[02:05:12.260 --> 02:05:17.260]   please go to twit.tv/clubtoit and join the fun.
[02:05:17.260 --> 02:05:22.300]   Twit.tv/clubtoit.
[02:05:22.300 --> 02:05:24.100]   It makes a huge difference to us.
[02:05:24.100 --> 02:05:27.340]   In fact, it's part of our, I think, going forward our plan
[02:05:27.340 --> 02:05:31.340]   to take a twit into the future is to make it
[02:05:31.340 --> 02:05:33.620]   more and more a part of the club.
[02:05:33.620 --> 02:05:35.580]   So help us out, will ya?
[02:05:35.580 --> 02:05:38.420]   Hey everybody, it's Leo LaPorte, the founder
[02:05:38.420 --> 02:05:41.980]   and host of many of the Twit podcasts.
[02:05:41.980 --> 02:05:45.100]   I don't normally talk to you about advertising,
[02:05:45.100 --> 02:05:47.860]   but I wanna take a moment to do that right now.
[02:05:47.860 --> 02:05:49.980]   Our mission statement at Twit,
[02:05:49.980 --> 02:05:53.100]   we're dedicated to building a highly engaged community
[02:05:53.100 --> 02:05:56.500]   of tech enthusiasts, that's our audience,
[02:05:56.500 --> 02:05:58.740]   and you, I guess, since you're listening,
[02:05:58.740 --> 02:06:01.500]   by offering them the knowledge they need to understand
[02:06:01.500 --> 02:06:04.380]   and use technology in today's world.
[02:06:04.380 --> 02:06:07.060]   To do that, we also create partnerships
[02:06:07.060 --> 02:06:10.100]   with trusted brands and make important introductions
[02:06:10.100 --> 02:06:11.460]   between them and our audience.
[02:06:11.460 --> 02:06:14.020]   That's how we finance our podcasts,
[02:06:14.020 --> 02:06:17.140]   but it's also, and our audience tells us this all the time,
[02:06:17.140 --> 02:06:18.660]   a part of the service we offer,
[02:06:18.660 --> 02:06:22.820]   it's a valued bit of information for our audience members.
[02:06:22.820 --> 02:06:26.860]   They wanna know about great brands, like yours.
[02:06:26.860 --> 02:06:30.900]   So can we help you by introducing you
[02:06:30.900 --> 02:06:32.820]   to our highly qualified audience?
[02:06:32.820 --> 02:06:37.500]   And why do you get a lot with advertising on the Twit podcasts?
[02:06:37.500 --> 02:06:39.100]   Partnering with Twit means you're gonna get,
[02:06:39.100 --> 02:06:41.540]   if I may say so, humbly, the gold standard
[02:06:41.540 --> 02:06:44.580]   in podcast advertising, and we throw in a lot
[02:06:44.580 --> 02:06:45.660]   of valuable services.
[02:06:45.660 --> 02:06:48.340]   You get a full service continuity team,
[02:06:48.340 --> 02:06:51.020]   supporting everything from copywriting to graphic design.
[02:06:51.020 --> 02:06:53.060]   I don't think anybody else does this
[02:06:53.060 --> 02:06:55.460]   or does this as well as we do.
[02:06:55.460 --> 02:06:57.780]   You get ads that are embedded in our content
[02:06:57.780 --> 02:06:59.100]   that are unique every time.
[02:06:59.100 --> 02:07:01.100]   I read them, our hosts read them.
[02:07:01.100 --> 02:07:03.420]   We always over deliver on impressions.
[02:07:03.420 --> 02:07:07.620]   And frankly, we're here to talk about your product.
[02:07:07.620 --> 02:07:11.260]   So we really give our listeners a great introduction
[02:07:11.260 --> 02:07:12.940]   to what you offer.
[02:07:12.940 --> 02:07:15.100]   We've got onboarding services,

[02:07:54.220 --> 02:07:56.420]   for an advertising partner that's gonna be
[02:07:56.420 --> 02:07:57.860]   with us long term.
[02:07:57.860 --> 02:07:59.980]   Visit twit.tv/advertise.
[02:07:59.980 --> 02:08:01.820]   Check out our partner testimonials.
[02:08:01.820 --> 02:08:04.460]   Tim Broome, founder of ITProTV.
[02:08:04.460 --> 02:08:07.580]   They started ITProTV in 2013,
[02:08:07.580 --> 02:08:09.940]   immediately started advertising with us
[02:08:09.940 --> 02:08:14.940]   and grew that company to a really amazing success.
[02:08:14.940 --> 02:08:18.900]   Hundreds of thousands of ongoing customers.
[02:08:18.900 --> 02:08:21.140]   They've been on our network for more than 10 years
[02:08:21.140 --> 02:08:23.140]   and they say, and I'll quote Tim,
[02:08:23.140 --> 02:08:25.540]   "We would not be where we are today without the Twit Network."
[02:08:25.540 --> 02:08:27.020]   That's just one example.
[02:08:27.020 --> 02:08:29.900]   Mark McCrary, who's the CEO of Authentic.
[02:08:29.900 --> 02:08:33.300]   He was actually one of the first people to buy ads
[02:08:33.300 --> 02:08:34.140]   on our network.
[02:08:34.140 --> 02:08:36.140]   He's been with us for 16 years.
[02:08:36.140 --> 02:08:37.940]   He said, and I'm quoting,
[02:08:37.940 --> 02:08:40.980]   "The feedback from many advertisers over those 16 years
[02:08:40.980 --> 02:08:43.340]   "across a range of product categories
[02:08:43.340 --> 02:08:47.380]   "is that if ads and podcasts are gonna work for a brand,
[02:08:47.380 --> 02:08:49.020]   "they're gonna work on Twit shows."
[02:08:49.020 --> 02:08:52.300]   I'm proud to say that the ads we do overdeliver.
[02:08:52.300 --> 02:08:54.580]   They work really well
[02:08:54.580 --> 02:08:56.940]   because they're honest, they have integrity.
[02:08:56.940 --> 02:08:58.980]   Our audience trusts us and we say,
[02:08:58.980 --> 02:09:00.580]   "This is a great product."
[02:09:00.580 --> 02:09:02.660]   They believe it, they listen.
[02:09:02.660 --> 02:09:04.500]   Our listeners are highly intelligent,
[02:09:04.500 --> 02:09:07.100]   they're heavily engaged, they're tech savvy,
[02:09:07.100 --> 02:09:08.940]   they're dedicated to our network.
[02:09:08.940 --> 02:09:10.780]   And that's partly because we only work
[02:09:10.780 --> 02:09:14.300]   with high integrity partners that we have thoroughly
[02:09:14.300 --> 02:09:16.540]   and personally vetted.
[02:09:16.540 --> 02:09:20.380]   I approve every single advertiser on the network.
[02:09:20.380 --> 02:09:21.860]   If you're ready to elevate your brand
[02:09:21.860 --> 02:09:23.540]   and you've got a great product,
[02:09:23.540 --> 02:09:25.260]   I want you to reach out to us.
[02:09:25.260 --> 02:09:28.140]   Advertise@twit.tv.
[02:09:28.140 --> 02:09:31.260]   So I want you to break out of the advertising norm,
[02:09:31.260 --> 02:09:36.260]   grow your brand with HostRed authentic ads on twit.tv.
[02:09:36.260 --> 02:09:40.260]   Visit twit.tv/advertise for more details
[02:09:40.260 --> 02:09:43.100]   or email us, advertise@twit.tv
[02:09:43.100 --> 02:09:45.900]   if you're ready to launch your campaign now.
[02:09:45.900 --> 02:09:47.060]   All right, Jason Snow,
[02:09:47.060 --> 02:09:49.580]   how about a pick of the week this week?
[02:09:49.580 --> 02:09:52.860]   - I'm gonna, I was thinking of a couple of things,
[02:09:52.860 --> 02:09:55.380]   some sort of open source stuff.
[02:09:55.380 --> 02:09:57.260]   I'm gonna go with one that I can't believe
[02:09:57.260 --> 02:09:58.780]   it hasn't been picked, it turned out that had,
[02:09:58.780 --> 02:10:02.380]   Merlin Mann picked it like 5,000 episodes ago.
[02:10:02.380 --> 02:10:03.220]   (laughs)
[02:10:03.220 --> 02:10:05.860]   But it's still there, so I'm gonna pick it, which is Caliber.
[02:10:05.860 --> 02:10:06.860]   - Oh, I love it, yep.
[02:10:06.860 --> 02:10:09.420]   - The ebook utility.
[02:10:09.420 --> 02:10:11.100]   I recently, like a couple of years ago,
[02:10:11.100 --> 02:10:15.620]   decided to switch from Kindle to Kobo.
[02:10:15.620 --> 02:10:17.220]   And I hear from people who are trying to switch
[02:10:17.220 --> 02:10:18.220]   from various different things.
[02:10:18.220 --> 02:10:19.500]   So they've got a bunch of e-pubs
[02:10:19.500 --> 02:10:22.060]   and they wanna put them in a Kindle or whatever.
[02:10:22.060 --> 02:10:24.540]   And Caliber is a free open source,
[02:10:24.540 --> 02:10:26.700]   and yeah, it looks open source.
[02:10:26.700 --> 02:10:28.740]   It looks like a Mac app from 2004,
[02:10:28.740 --> 02:10:30.020]   but you know, it works great.
[02:10:30.020 --> 02:10:31.820]   It's updated constantly,
[02:10:31.820 --> 02:10:33.580]   like literally if you leave the auto update on,
[02:10:33.580 --> 02:10:34.940]   every time you launch it,
[02:10:34.940 --> 02:10:36.540]   you will be told that there is an update.
[02:10:36.540 --> 02:10:37.500]   - It's a big team, yeah.
[02:10:37.500 --> 02:10:38.940]   - And it's got a plugin architecture.
[02:10:38.940 --> 02:10:40.700]   And so I will tell you,
[02:10:40.700 --> 02:10:42.340]   you gotta do a little searching,
[02:10:42.340 --> 02:10:45.980]   you gotta look for the DDRM plugin if you must.
[02:10:45.980 --> 02:10:47.220]   But if you've got a Kindle,
[02:10:47.220 --> 02:10:49.980]   but you also want to, for example,
[02:10:49.980 --> 02:10:52.620]   save that off as a non-DRM Kindle book,
[02:10:52.620 --> 02:10:54.500]   there are ways to do it.
[02:10:54.500 --> 02:10:57.100]   I can migrate my Kindle books to my Kobo,
[02:10:57.100 --> 02:10:59.380]   so I can have them anywhere I want.
[02:10:59.380 --> 02:11:02.140]   When I buy a book that's in e-pub format,
[02:11:02.140 --> 02:11:05.780]   I drag it into Caliber and it will format it,
[02:11:05.780 --> 02:11:08.540]   like all nice and fancy for my Kobo,
[02:11:08.540 --> 02:11:10.140]   using their Kobo plugin.
[02:11:10.140 --> 02:11:13.900]   The sky's the limit, really, if you've got e-books,
[02:11:13.900 --> 02:11:15.780]   especially books you've downloaded,
[02:11:15.780 --> 02:11:19.020]   or you wanna migrate off of Kindle or something like that,
[02:11:19.020 --> 02:11:20.180]   Caliber does all that stuff.
[02:11:20.180 --> 02:11:23.540]   You can also clean up the cover art
[02:11:23.540 --> 02:11:25.620]   or change the name of the author,
[02:11:25.620 --> 02:11:27.780]   or do whatever you want to organize it.
[02:11:27.780 --> 02:11:32.780]   It's sorta like iTunes for books, except not as nice,
[02:11:32.780 --> 02:11:36.580]   and you wouldn't probably wanna read 'em on it.
[02:11:36.580 --> 02:11:40.540]   But I have been plugging my e-book readers into Caliber
[02:11:40.540 --> 02:11:43.500]   for more than a decade now
[02:11:43.500 --> 02:11:45.900]   in order to move files back and forth.
[02:11:45.900 --> 02:11:47.940]   And it actually works great.
[02:11:47.940 --> 02:11:50.260]   And yeah, so some of the DRM you have to get plugins
[02:11:50.260 --> 02:11:52.300]   to bypass it, but--
[02:11:52.300 --> 02:11:54.180]   - But you can, it's a great--
[02:11:54.180 --> 02:11:55.860]   - It's just a great, it's just great, Tilly.
[02:11:55.860 --> 02:11:59.220]   And I'm a firm believer that if I bought the book on Kindle
[02:11:59.220 --> 02:12:00.900]   and I wanna read it somewhere else,
[02:12:00.900 --> 02:12:02.500]   I should be allowed to do that.
[02:12:02.500 --> 02:12:03.900]   And Caliber lets me do it.
[02:12:03.900 --> 02:12:04.740]   - Yeah.
[02:12:04.740 --> 02:12:07.340]   I have a Caliber project, I've got it,
[02:12:07.340 --> 02:12:09.500]   because what I do is I buy a lot of books online,
[02:12:09.500 --> 02:12:10.740]   especially programming books,
[02:12:10.740 --> 02:12:13.460]   and I just put 'em in Apple's iBooks,
[02:12:13.460 --> 02:12:16.140]   just because it's there, but that's only on Apple
[02:12:16.140 --> 02:12:17.660]   and I use a lot of other systems.
[02:12:17.660 --> 02:12:20.300]   So I really have to sit down and,
[02:12:20.300 --> 02:12:23.500]   I have hundreds, I have a whole library of books
[02:12:23.500 --> 02:12:26.300]   that are e-books, and I guys convert 'em all into one format,
[02:12:26.300 --> 02:12:27.700]   keep 'em on a central database.
[02:12:27.700 --> 02:12:29.460]   Caliber is easily the way to do it.
[02:12:29.460 --> 02:12:33.540]   C-A-L-I-B-R-E-E-Book.com.
[02:12:33.540 --> 02:12:36.060]   - Yeah, the big secret is,
[02:12:36.060 --> 02:12:38.380]   if you've got a Kindle even, if it's an older Kindle,
[02:12:38.380 --> 02:12:40.900]   what you can do is you put your serial number in
[02:12:40.900 --> 02:12:42.900]   to the DRM plugin, and then you can go,
[02:12:42.900 --> 02:12:44.100]   I'm just giving away the story here,
[02:12:44.100 --> 02:12:46.860]   but a little known fact that your Kindle books
[02:12:46.860 --> 02:12:51.860]   can be downloaded directly on your Mac as a file.
[02:12:51.860 --> 02:12:54.580]   They don't want you to do it,
[02:12:54.580 --> 02:12:57.300]   you have to go find that option,
[02:12:57.300 --> 02:13:00.380]   but when you do that, you can get it out
[02:13:00.380 --> 02:13:03.220]   and into a format where it can go anywhere you want.
[02:13:03.220 --> 02:13:05.260]   And I just, again, I'm just a believer
[02:13:05.260 --> 02:13:08.260]   that Amazon doesn't have the right to prevent me
[02:13:08.260 --> 02:13:10.660]   from using that book that I bought somewhere else.
[02:13:10.660 --> 02:13:12.100]   So, Caliber lets me do that.
[02:13:12.100 --> 02:13:16.180]   - Yep, really a great tool, good recommendation.
[02:13:16.180 --> 02:13:18.180]   - Mr. Andy and I co-pick of the week.
[02:13:18.180 --> 02:13:22.020]   - I'm one of those freaks who I have,
[02:13:22.020 --> 02:13:23.980]   I subscribe to the music streaming services,
[02:13:23.980 --> 02:13:27.220]   but my music library is music files that I have on my server.
[02:13:27.220 --> 02:13:28.060]   - What?
[02:13:28.060 --> 02:13:29.900]   - And on my phone and on my devices, exactly.
[02:13:29.900 --> 02:13:30.740]   - What?
[02:13:30.740 --> 02:13:33.940]   - I buy CD sometimes, I bag of them for five,
[02:13:33.940 --> 02:13:35.940]   a whole bag of them for five bucks
[02:13:35.940 --> 02:13:38.540]   instead of like 10 bucks for the whole thing.
[02:13:38.540 --> 02:13:43.540]   Rip them and buy high resolutions music off of hdtrex.com.
[02:13:44.260 --> 02:13:47.780]   I believe that I'd want to be able to own my music
[02:13:47.780 --> 02:13:50.540]   to be able to play them and use them on any app I want,
[02:13:50.540 --> 02:13:52.260]   any servers that I want.
[02:13:52.260 --> 02:13:53.940]   And also I don't want to have to worry
[02:13:53.940 --> 02:13:56.500]   that if I ever get rid of my subscription to Apple Music
[02:13:56.500 --> 02:13:58.860]   or Spotify, I will lose all the playlists
[02:13:58.860 --> 02:14:00.540]   that I've created, I'll lose all the,
[02:14:00.540 --> 02:14:02.500]   let me know the library that I've created.
[02:14:02.500 --> 02:14:06.100]   The problem being an Apple user is that Apple Music
[02:14:06.100 --> 02:14:11.100]   has kind of crushed the market for like offline music players,
[02:14:11.180 --> 02:14:14.220]   for music players that are based on files
[02:14:14.220 --> 02:14:16.340]   that are somewhere accessible by your phone
[02:14:16.340 --> 02:14:18.180]   or your computer.
[02:14:18.180 --> 02:14:20.380]   There's an app called Vox that I don't like very much
[02:14:20.380 --> 02:14:23.020]   'cause it's just, I just don't like it too expensive.
[02:14:23.020 --> 02:14:25.060]   - Oh, long time subscriber day, Vox.
[02:14:25.060 --> 02:14:27.580]   I would love to replace it if you got a good choice.
[02:14:27.580 --> 02:14:30.260]   - Yeah, this is, I found an app recently called Doppler
[02:14:30.260 --> 02:14:32.180]   that's been around for two or three years.
[02:14:32.180 --> 02:14:36.340]   It's available for the Mac and for the iPhone.
[02:14:36.340 --> 02:14:40.700]   And it really is like I've tuned 1.0, 2.0,
[02:14:40.700 --> 02:14:44.380]   meaning it's very, very simple, but very, very powerful,
[02:14:44.380 --> 02:14:48.500]   supports every music format you could probably deal with.
[02:14:48.500 --> 02:14:50.060]   It supports high resolution music,
[02:14:50.060 --> 02:14:53.580]   it also supports spatial audio, but at its root,
[02:14:53.580 --> 02:14:57.980]   it is the simplicity of if you point it at a folder of music,
[02:14:57.980 --> 02:15:01.420]   that's on your Mac, if you've got an iPhone,
[02:15:01.420 --> 02:15:04.060]   you've pointed at your files app and pointed at
[02:15:04.060 --> 02:15:06.820]   like whatever app is gonna be slurping
[02:15:06.820 --> 02:15:09.020]   in your music files into it.
[02:15:09.020 --> 02:15:12.580]   And then it's simply, it's a very, very good modern music player.
[02:15:12.580 --> 02:15:14.500]   You can create playlists, it's got album art,
[02:15:14.500 --> 02:15:16.620]   it will find the album art for you,
[02:15:16.620 --> 02:15:19.540]   it's got DJ features, and it's just, again,
[02:15:19.540 --> 02:15:21.340]   it doesn't have to be complicated.
[02:15:21.340 --> 02:15:22.580]   As a matter of fact, and you could say
[02:15:22.580 --> 02:15:25.620]   that it has to be not complicated in order to work.
[02:15:25.620 --> 02:15:28.060]   And it really is for me the best app that I found
[02:15:28.060 --> 02:15:29.940]   for the iPhone to get me that sort of thing
[02:15:29.940 --> 02:15:34.860]   where I have, again, I've got, I wanna put like eight gigabytes
[02:15:34.860 --> 02:15:37.340]   worth of music files on my phone,
[02:15:37.340 --> 02:15:39.180]   and I'd just be able to play it.
[02:15:39.180 --> 02:15:41.660]   Now, I know that if you are listening,
[02:15:41.660 --> 02:15:42.860]   you're thinking, well, who cares?
[02:15:42.860 --> 02:15:47.420]   Like even Apple Music will let you import like music files.
[02:15:47.420 --> 02:15:50.020]   Oh my God, oh my God, it's like the Borg.
[02:15:50.020 --> 02:15:53.340]   It will, they will cease to be,
[02:15:53.340 --> 02:15:57.700]   there'll be like this walking undead thing where,
[02:15:57.700 --> 02:16:01.980]   maybe it's your music files, maybe it's files that say,
[02:16:01.980 --> 02:16:05.260]   oh, well, he wouldn't want to stream these actual files.
[02:16:05.260 --> 02:16:06.980]   He'd want to get this off of Apple Music,
[02:16:06.980 --> 02:16:09.020]   and you have no idea whether you've,
[02:16:09.020 --> 02:16:11.660]   what parts of your library are stuff that you own,
[02:16:11.660 --> 02:16:14.140]   what parts of your library are stuff that you're screaming.
[02:16:14.140 --> 02:16:17.780]   And also, I still don't trust Apple Music to do anything.
[02:16:17.780 --> 02:16:20.900]   I don't want it to touch my actual files,
[02:16:20.900 --> 02:16:21.740]   music library.
[02:16:21.740 --> 02:16:24.180]   I've got thousands and thousands of albums.
[02:16:24.180 --> 02:16:27.620]   I've got something like 18,000, 19,000 music tracks
[02:16:27.620 --> 02:16:28.460]   that are in there.
[02:16:28.460 --> 02:16:31.180]   And if any app were to screw this up,
[02:16:31.180 --> 02:16:34.500]   I would instantly, I would find new sources of hate
[02:16:34.500 --> 02:16:37.580]   and apply it to that thing very, very quickly.
[02:16:37.580 --> 02:16:39.020]   Doppler, it's very, very simple.
[02:16:39.020 --> 02:16:40.220]   It's straightforward.
[02:16:40.220 --> 02:16:42.500]   You can even import stuff via Wi-Fi
[02:16:42.500 --> 02:16:45.180]   so that if you're on a Windows machine
[02:16:45.180 --> 02:16:50.020]   and you just want to upload something from USB key,
[02:16:50.020 --> 02:16:53.820]   if you put a USB key into your iPhone, it'll work from there.
[02:16:53.820 --> 02:16:56.500]   I can't, it really, I can't make it sound,
[02:16:56.500 --> 02:16:57.780]   I don't want to make it sound complicated
[02:16:57.780 --> 02:17:00.060]   because it is exactly what I was looking for.
[02:17:00.060 --> 02:17:02.940]   Just like here is some music.
[02:17:02.940 --> 02:17:05.660]   If you won't even necessarily have to build
[02:17:05.660 --> 02:17:06.820]   its own Doppler library,
[02:17:06.820 --> 02:17:07.780]   if you want to just simply say,
[02:17:07.780 --> 02:17:09.820]   leave it in place, just play it from there,
[02:17:09.820 --> 02:17:11.660]   create a directory for your own needs
[02:17:11.660 --> 02:17:13.380]   so you can access it very quickly.
[02:17:13.380 --> 02:17:14.820]   And it's not very expensive.
[02:17:14.820 --> 02:17:17.620]   It's seven bucks after a seven day free trial
[02:17:17.620 --> 02:17:19.700]   on the iPhone, no iPad version.
[02:17:19.700 --> 02:17:22.020]   It'll run as an iPhone app on your iPad.
[02:17:22.020 --> 02:17:23.580]   The Mac version is kind of spendy.
[02:17:23.580 --> 02:17:26.380]   It's like 30 bucks, but I'm happy to spend it
[02:17:26.380 --> 02:17:29.460]   if it means that, again, I get a very, very good,
[02:17:29.460 --> 02:17:31.980]   full featured, full-throated music player
[02:17:31.980 --> 02:17:33.740]   that will not tamper with my stuff.
[02:17:33.740 --> 02:17:36.340]   I have actually have a Sony Walkman
[02:17:36.340 --> 02:17:39.500]   with a 512 gigabyte micro SD card.
[02:17:39.500 --> 02:17:44.500]   And I just simply plug my Walkman into my MacBook,
[02:17:44.500 --> 02:17:47.620]   use it as a mass storage device,
[02:17:47.620 --> 02:17:49.780]   and then Doppler simply plays the music
[02:17:49.780 --> 02:17:53.060]   and plays a playlist off of the storage that's inside there.
[02:17:53.060 --> 02:17:54.500]   That's exactly what I want.
[02:17:54.500 --> 02:17:56.740]   And I can't believe how frustrated I got
[02:17:56.740 --> 02:17:59.420]   when I set up the iPhone 14 Pro
[02:17:59.420 --> 02:18:01.220]   and try to make it a daily driver
[02:18:01.220 --> 02:18:03.940]   when it was just so damn difficult to say,
[02:18:03.940 --> 02:18:06.780]   I don't even want you to get the entire library.
[02:18:06.780 --> 02:18:11.100]   Just this one like eight gigabyte folder full of stuff.
[02:18:11.100 --> 02:18:12.860]   Just let me, nope, nope, you have to import it.
[02:18:12.860 --> 02:18:13.700]   No, you have to do this.
[02:18:13.700 --> 02:18:15.300]   Like, no, I don't want you to do this.
[02:18:15.300 --> 02:18:16.940]   I wish I'd found Doppler back then,
[02:18:16.940 --> 02:18:18.820]   'cause it's exactly what I wanted.
[02:18:18.820 --> 02:18:22.500]   Now I wanna combine your pick with Jason's pick
[02:18:22.500 --> 02:18:25.420]   and do something for audiobooks
[02:18:25.420 --> 02:18:27.540]   that would be the same way, right?
[02:18:27.540 --> 02:18:30.420]   So I could, you know, oh, so,
[02:18:30.420 --> 02:18:32.940]   'cause it is possible to strip the copy protection
[02:18:32.940 --> 02:18:34.220]   of all the audiobooks,
[02:18:34.220 --> 02:18:36.060]   but I would like to have them in a,
[02:18:36.060 --> 02:18:37.380]   I don't know, Dropbox or somewhere
[02:18:37.380 --> 02:18:39.740]   and be able to play them from anywhere
[02:18:39.740 --> 02:18:41.740]   and have the features of audiobooks,
[02:18:41.740 --> 02:18:44.500]   which is you stop and you start where you stopped.
[02:18:44.500 --> 02:18:46.100]   - Yeah.
[02:18:46.100 --> 02:18:48.020]   - Do you mention something a couple of years ago
[02:18:48.020 --> 02:18:51.820]   that was a pick, but I don't think it ever really emerged.
[02:18:51.820 --> 02:18:53.900]   I've been following it closely
[02:18:53.900 --> 02:18:56.260]   and it never productized.
[02:18:56.260 --> 02:18:59.740]   So somebody ever comes up with one of those, let me know.
[02:18:59.740 --> 02:19:02.220]   Alex, Lindsey, I'm gonna, before you do your pick of the week,
[02:19:02.220 --> 02:19:04.940]   I am gonna show you a pick I think you should buy.
[02:19:04.940 --> 02:19:07.060]   It's only half an Alex.
[02:19:07.060 --> 02:19:12.060]   It's called The Monocle at BrilliantMonocle.com,
[02:19:12.060 --> 02:19:16.220]   a pocket-sized AR device.
[02:19:16.220 --> 02:19:17.940]   It's kind of like, I think it's kind of like
[02:19:17.940 --> 02:19:21.700]   the Google Glass Prism screen,
[02:19:21.700 --> 02:19:23.420]   but it's a monocle.
[02:19:23.420 --> 02:19:25.180]   (laughs)
[02:19:25.180 --> 02:19:26.180]   And it's hackable.
[02:19:26.180 --> 02:19:27.020]   - Oh, good.
[02:19:27.020 --> 02:19:28.740]   - 'Cause it's an open source.
[02:19:28.740 --> 02:19:31.740]   - So you could, yeah, hold on.
[02:19:31.740 --> 02:19:32.580]   So I don't know.
[02:19:32.580 --> 02:19:33.980]   - Do you mention?
[02:19:33.980 --> 02:19:36.300]   - It's just, I don't know if anybody makes it.
[02:19:36.300 --> 02:19:37.700]   It's open source.
[02:19:37.700 --> 02:19:41.300]   It's BrilliantMonocle.com, but it is 350 bucks.
[02:19:41.300 --> 02:19:42.900]   That's why I want you to buy it.
[02:19:42.900 --> 02:19:47.380]   And it's 15 grams, two hour battery.
[02:19:47.380 --> 02:19:52.660]   And you just can, I don't know what you do with it.
[02:19:52.660 --> 02:19:54.100]   You can just do something with it.
[02:19:54.100 --> 02:19:56.980]   - I think it's something that you have to figure it out.
[02:19:56.980 --> 02:19:57.980]   Like it's-- - Yeah, yeah.
[02:19:57.980 --> 02:19:59.420]   - It doesn't do anything.
[02:19:59.420 --> 02:20:01.420]   - Yeah, an OS or something to integrate.
[02:20:01.420 --> 02:20:05.020]   - It's the Raspberry Pi and monocles, is what it is.
[02:20:05.020 --> 02:20:08.380]   So, which we've-- - It's so typical
[02:20:08.380 --> 02:20:10.140]   of like modern like AR.
[02:20:10.140 --> 02:20:13.460]   It's like, hi, we've developed the groundbreaking hardware.
[02:20:13.460 --> 02:20:15.740]   Please buy it, write software for it.
[02:20:15.740 --> 02:20:18.380]   Tell us what it's useful for.
[02:20:18.380 --> 02:20:20.980]   And then let us use that to hopefully
[02:20:20.980 --> 02:20:22.180]   figure out how to sell this thing.
[02:20:22.180 --> 02:20:25.540]   - It supports a version of Python called MicroPython
[02:20:25.540 --> 02:20:27.700]   that you can use to program it.
[02:20:27.700 --> 02:20:28.980]   Flash your monocle.
[02:20:28.980 --> 02:20:31.380]   Anyway, don't flash your monocle.
[02:20:31.380 --> 02:20:34.260]   Just do your pick of the week, if you would.
[02:20:34.260 --> 02:20:37.940]   - One minor MicroPIC, I'm testing new camera.
[02:20:37.940 --> 02:20:39.420]   So I've been testing it for the show.
[02:20:39.420 --> 02:20:40.540]   - It looks good. - This is--
[02:20:40.540 --> 02:20:41.380]   - What is it?
[02:20:41.380 --> 02:20:43.220]   - Yeah, yeah, this is the Sony FR7.
[02:20:43.220 --> 02:20:46.380]   So they sent me a test unit to play with.
[02:20:46.380 --> 02:20:48.180]   So for the next, this week and next week,
[02:20:48.180 --> 02:20:49.580]   I'll probably be on it.
[02:20:49.580 --> 02:20:51.020]   Haven't done any real color corrections.
[02:20:51.020 --> 02:20:53.580]   This is like just what the camera does when it turns on.
[02:20:53.580 --> 02:20:54.420]   And--
[02:20:54.420 --> 02:20:55.420]   - It looks good. - And it is--
[02:20:55.420 --> 02:20:56.820]   - It really looks good. - Yeah, it's a PTZ.
[02:20:56.820 --> 02:20:57.660]   It's a PTZ.
[02:20:57.660 --> 02:21:00.260]   So I don't have it hooked up yet to the controller.
[02:21:00.260 --> 02:21:01.220]   There's a controller for it.
[02:21:01.220 --> 02:21:03.980]   Like there is a controller for it.
[02:21:03.980 --> 02:21:04.820]   - What?
[02:21:04.820 --> 02:21:05.660]   (laughing)
[02:21:05.660 --> 02:21:07.820]   - And then there's also, but what's even cooler though,
[02:21:07.820 --> 02:21:11.260]   is there is an iPad version.
[02:21:11.260 --> 02:21:16.260]   So this is an iPad wireless connected to--
[02:21:16.260 --> 02:21:18.580]   - Do you drag your finger and point it and stuff?
[02:21:18.580 --> 02:21:20.900]   - When I balance the camera, because I put--
[02:21:20.900 --> 02:21:22.820]   I got it last night late and I put it together
[02:21:22.820 --> 02:21:25.940]   and I was like, "Man, as long as it's got an image,
[02:21:25.940 --> 02:21:26.780]   "I'll be interested."
[02:21:26.780 --> 02:21:27.620]   - Yeah, I'll be interested.
[02:21:27.620 --> 02:21:28.460]   - Yeah, I'll be interested.
[02:21:28.460 --> 02:21:29.460]   - Yeah, I'll be interested.
[02:21:29.460 --> 02:21:30.300]   - Yeah, I'll be interested.
[02:21:30.300 --> 02:21:31.140]   - Yeah, I'll be interested.
[02:21:31.140 --> 02:21:31.980]   - Yeah, I'll be interested.
[02:21:31.980 --> 02:21:32.820]   - Yeah, I'll be interested.
[02:21:32.820 --> 02:21:33.660]   - Yeah, I'll be interested.
[02:21:33.660 --> 02:21:34.500]   - Yeah, I'll be interested.
[02:21:34.500 --> 02:21:35.340]   - Yeah, I'll be interested.
[02:21:35.340 --> 02:21:36.180]   - Yeah, I'll be interested.
[02:21:36.180 --> 02:21:37.020]   - Yeah, I'll be interested.
[02:21:37.020 --> 02:21:37.860]   - Yeah, I'll be interested.
[02:21:37.860 --> 02:21:38.700]   - Yeah, I'll be interested.
[02:21:38.700 --> 02:21:39.540]   - Yeah, I'll be interested.
[02:21:39.540 --> 02:21:40.380]   - Yeah, I'll be interested.
[02:21:40.380 --> 02:21:41.220]   - Yeah, I'll be interested.
[02:21:41.220 --> 02:21:42.220]   - Yeah, I'll be interested.
[02:21:42.220 --> 02:21:43.060]   - Yeah, I'll be interested.
[02:21:43.060 --> 02:21:43.900]   - Yeah, I'll be interested.
[02:21:43.900 --> 02:21:44.740]   - Yeah, I'll be interested.
[02:21:44.740 --> 02:21:57.740]   - Yeah, I'll be interested.
[02:21:57.740 --> 02:21:58.740]   - Yeah, I'll be interested.
[02:21:58.740 --> 02:21:59.740]   - Yeah, I'll be interested.
[02:21:59.740 --> 02:22:00.740]   - Yeah, I'll be interested.
[02:22:00.740 --> 02:22:01.740]   - Yeah, I'll be interested.
[02:22:01.740 --> 02:22:02.740]   - Yeah, I'll be interested.
[02:22:02.740 --> 02:22:03.740]   - Yeah, I'll be interested.
[02:22:03.740 --> 02:22:04.740]   - Yeah, I'll be interested.
[02:22:04.740 --> 02:22:05.740]   - Yeah, I'll be interested.
[02:22:05.740 --> 02:22:06.740]   - Yeah, I'll be interested.
[02:22:06.740 --> 02:22:07.740]   - Yeah, I'll be interested.
[02:22:07.740 --> 02:22:08.740]   - Yeah, I'll be interested.

[02:25:20.740 --> 02:25:21.740]   - Hang me in the news.
[02:25:21.740 --> 02:25:24.740]   - That's the one where if you're trying to get way too much
[02:25:24.740 --> 02:25:29.740]   lumber on the top of your car, home center, you basically,
[02:25:29.740 --> 02:25:32.740]   it's tight, you can dog it down really good, and then it just
[02:25:32.740 --> 02:25:34.740]   comes apart with one tug on the right side.
[02:25:34.740 --> 02:25:36.740]   - So that's how I know you're a man.
[02:25:36.740 --> 02:25:37.740]   - What's that one called?
[02:25:37.740 --> 02:25:38.740]   - You know that.
[02:25:38.740 --> 02:25:41.740]   - I do admit, I have a knot that I do that I haven't found in
[02:25:41.740 --> 02:25:43.740]   the app, and it sounds like what you're talking about.
[02:25:43.740 --> 02:25:45.740]   - I learned it as the roadman slipknot.
[02:25:45.740 --> 02:25:50.740]   - Yeah, 'cause I tie green screens in a very specific way,
[02:25:50.740 --> 02:25:53.740]   and I can't find it, I can't name it, but what it is, is I wrap
[02:25:53.740 --> 02:25:56.740]   it twice and then go around and through, and if I pull it to
[02:25:56.740 --> 02:25:59.740]   the side, it'll just open up again, but it'll hold that green
[02:25:59.740 --> 02:26:00.740]   screen forever.
[02:26:00.740 --> 02:26:04.740]   - There are class of knots where you're basically, the knot is
[02:26:04.740 --> 02:26:08.740]   binding on a loop that you've put through the loop, and so
[02:26:08.740 --> 02:26:12.740]   basically once you basically undo that loop, the whole thing
[02:26:12.740 --> 02:26:13.740]   gets free.
[02:26:13.740 --> 02:26:17.740]   - Yeah, so my dad and I were like the unlicensed home
[02:26:17.740 --> 02:26:19.740]   contractors for the entire extended family.
[02:26:19.740 --> 02:26:23.740]   We would make lots of very, very sketchy trips with very,
[02:26:23.740 --> 02:26:27.740]   very, very, very, very ill-advised loads on the top of a car
[02:26:27.740 --> 02:26:31.740]   that was not designed for such a thing, and the third time
[02:26:31.740 --> 02:26:35.740]   I was on, found myself on the roadside of 128, trying to get
[02:26:35.740 --> 02:26:39.740]   a piece of plywood to be centered back on the dodge, I
[02:26:39.740 --> 02:26:40.740]   learned this knot.
[02:26:40.740 --> 02:26:45.740]   - Is it this, is it this, is it the roadman slip knot, they
[02:26:45.740 --> 02:26:48.740]   just call it a regular everyday slip knot, is that it?
[02:26:48.740 --> 02:26:49.740]   No.
[02:26:49.740 --> 02:26:50.740]   - That's not it.
[02:26:50.740 --> 02:26:51.740]   - That's not it.
[02:26:51.740 --> 02:26:52.740]   - Okay.
[02:26:52.740 --> 02:26:53.740]   - That's a regular slip knot.
[02:26:53.740 --> 02:26:55.740]   - I'll find it, I'll make her pick the weakest.
[02:26:55.740 --> 02:26:57.740]   - Is it the surgical slip tie?
[02:26:57.740 --> 02:27:01.740]   You have to wear rubber gloves to do it, I don't know.
[02:27:01.740 --> 02:27:03.740]   Is it the non-slip mono knot?
[02:27:03.740 --> 02:27:04.740]   - I don't know.
[02:27:04.740 --> 02:27:05.740]   - See, there's so many options.
[02:27:05.740 --> 02:27:07.740]   - So many good knots in the world.
[02:27:07.740 --> 02:27:12.740]   It's all, you know, topology is what it is, that's what it is.
[02:27:12.740 --> 02:27:17.740]   I looked up roadman's slip knot and it didn't know that.
[02:27:17.740 --> 02:27:19.740]   Maybe if I do truckers knot.
[02:27:19.740 --> 02:27:21.740]   - Could be called something like that.
[02:27:21.740 --> 02:27:23.740]   - Cause it's kind of, you know.
[02:27:23.740 --> 02:27:24.740]   - I have to admit, I look at it.
[02:27:24.740 --> 02:27:25.740]   - Here's the truckers itch.
[02:27:25.740 --> 02:27:26.740]   Is that it?
[02:27:26.740 --> 02:27:28.740]   - That's, yeah, that looks like it.
[02:27:28.740 --> 02:27:29.740]   - Yeah, it's a valuable knot.
[02:27:29.740 --> 02:27:30.740]   - It's a valuable knot.
[02:27:30.740 --> 02:27:33.740]   - Usually used for securing loads or tarpolins.
[02:27:33.740 --> 02:27:37.740]   (laughing)
[02:27:37.740 --> 02:27:40.740]   It's the truckers itch or the truckers itch quick release.
[02:27:40.740 --> 02:27:42.740]   Maybe you prefer that.
[02:27:42.740 --> 02:27:44.740]   All right, now we can spend a whole show.
[02:27:44.740 --> 02:27:47.740]   Maybe we should do this week in knots, but maybe not.
[02:27:47.740 --> 02:27:49.740]   - Are you funny interviews on what about the knot?
[02:27:49.740 --> 02:27:50.740]   - Maybe not.
[02:27:50.740 --> 02:27:51.740]   - You're like, "Oh, no."
[02:27:51.740 --> 02:27:53.740]   - There's a YouTube channel there where you interview
[02:27:53.740 --> 02:27:54.740]   freaks in the talk.
[02:27:54.740 --> 02:27:56.740]   You talk about like, "Okay, well, this is the, this is the
[02:27:56.740 --> 02:27:59.740]   "Clove Hitch and this kind of goes back to the Phoenicians and the,
[02:27:59.740 --> 02:28:02.740]   "you know, we, those first things are referred to it was this
[02:28:02.740 --> 02:28:04.740]   "and this is what you use for."
[02:28:04.740 --> 02:28:06.740]   - Where do you learn your sewin ship that?
[02:28:06.740 --> 02:28:07.740]   - You gotta cut it.
[02:28:07.740 --> 02:28:08.740]   - That ain't gonna ship.
[02:28:08.740 --> 02:28:09.740]   - You gotta, you gotta cut to a ship.
[02:28:09.740 --> 02:28:12.740]   You gotta cut to a ship of like how they would use it and then
[02:28:12.740 --> 02:28:13.740]   sail and...
[02:28:13.740 --> 02:28:15.740]   - I think, I think that would be a great channel.
[02:28:15.740 --> 02:28:16.740]   - It's a great channel.
[02:28:16.740 --> 02:28:18.740]   - Alex Lindsey's got a great channel.
[02:28:18.740 --> 02:28:21.740]   And I think maybe there'll be a not show coming up on Office
[02:28:21.740 --> 02:28:22.740]   Hours Time Club.
[02:28:22.740 --> 02:28:23.740]   - I don't know.
[02:28:23.740 --> 02:28:24.740]   (laughing)
[02:28:24.740 --> 02:28:26.740]   - How far can he push it, ladies and gentlemen?
[02:28:26.740 --> 02:28:27.740]   Office Hours.
[02:28:27.740 --> 02:28:29.740]   Global is free and open to all.
[02:28:29.740 --> 02:28:31.740]   If you go to the website, you'll see all the things they've done
[02:28:31.740 --> 02:28:32.740]   and are about to do.
[02:28:32.740 --> 02:28:34.740]   - We had Doc Rock on on Monday.
[02:28:34.740 --> 02:28:37.740]   - Oh, I love Doc Rock talking about the new E-cam, probably, yes.
[02:28:37.740 --> 02:28:39.740]   - He was just talking about communities in general.
[02:28:39.740 --> 02:28:42.740]   So on Monday, he was, he mentioned E-cam,
[02:28:42.740 --> 02:28:44.740]   but, and talked about it a little bit, but...
[02:28:44.740 --> 02:28:45.740]   - It's wonderful.
[02:28:45.740 --> 02:28:47.740]   - Yeah, he, he was, he did great.
[02:28:47.740 --> 02:28:48.740]   - Yeah.
[02:28:48.740 --> 02:28:50.740]   - Ruthless Reviews coming up Wednesday.
[02:28:50.740 --> 02:28:52.740]   - Yeah, those are fun because you get to,
[02:28:52.740 --> 02:28:54.740]   you get to just listen to us pick at each other.
[02:28:54.740 --> 02:28:57.740]   Like literally the Ruthless Review is that someone comes on
[02:28:57.740 --> 02:29:00.740]   and they say, "Well, the audio is just a little bit."
[02:29:00.740 --> 02:29:01.740]   - Oh, man.
[02:29:01.740 --> 02:29:02.740]   - Oh.
[02:29:02.740 --> 02:29:04.740]   - And so as we get better, it's, it's good.
[02:29:04.740 --> 02:29:05.740]   - It's good.
[02:29:05.740 --> 02:29:06.740]   - We push it pretty hard.
[02:29:06.740 --> 02:29:08.740]   - All sorts of good stuff, understanding alpha channels
[02:29:08.740 --> 02:29:09.740]   this morning.
[02:29:09.740 --> 02:29:11.740]   You can join the Zoom if you want to participate
[02:29:11.740 --> 02:29:13.740]   or you can just watch it after the fact.
[02:29:13.740 --> 02:29:14.740]   Best place to start with the whole thing,
[02:29:14.740 --> 02:29:15.740]   officehours.global.
[02:29:15.740 --> 02:29:18.740]   And of course, if you want to hire Alex for your next
[02:29:18.740 --> 02:29:23.740]   streaming event, 090.media.
[02:29:23.740 --> 02:29:26.740]   Andy Inaco, when are you going to be on GBH next?
[02:29:26.740 --> 02:29:29.740]   - I'm off this week, but I'm on next Friday
[02:29:29.740 --> 02:29:31.740]   at 1230 at the Boston Public Library.
[02:29:31.740 --> 02:29:34.740]   You can stream it live or later at wgphnews.org.
[02:29:34.740 --> 02:29:38.740]   - And I must ask you as I am often told by our fabulous
[02:29:38.740 --> 02:29:43.740]   club twitters, when is in thatco.com launching?
[02:29:43.740 --> 02:29:45.740]   - Thank you for keeping up with the pressure.
[02:29:45.740 --> 02:29:47.740]   - The pressure is on.
[02:29:47.740 --> 02:29:48.740]   - Yeah, I know.
[02:29:48.740 --> 02:29:52.740]   It's, I've got most of the new content actually loaded up.
[02:29:52.740 --> 02:29:55.740]   Now I just basically have to decide that whatever the design
[02:29:55.740 --> 02:29:56.740]   is, it's the design.
[02:29:56.740 --> 02:29:57.740]   I'm not going to be able to change it.
[02:29:57.740 --> 02:29:58.740]   - No more fussing.
[02:29:58.740 --> 02:29:59.740]   - All right.
[02:29:59.740 --> 02:30:00.740]   - Yeah, exactly.
[02:30:00.740 --> 02:30:01.740]   - I asked.
[02:30:01.740 --> 02:30:02.740]   - Thank you.
[02:30:02.740 --> 02:30:03.740]   Thank you.
[02:30:03.740 --> 02:30:04.740]   Thank you for your interest.
[02:30:04.740 --> 02:30:07.740]   It does keep me honest because I'm like, oh God.
[02:30:07.740 --> 02:30:09.740]   I know I have to do this.
[02:30:09.740 --> 02:30:11.740]   I know I have to make a bunch of decisions and actually
[02:30:11.740 --> 02:30:12.740]   wire some things up.
[02:30:12.740 --> 02:30:15.740]   It's like, oh, or I could just stare inside the window.
[02:30:15.740 --> 02:30:16.740]   Oh, look, there's a doggy.
[02:30:16.740 --> 02:30:17.740]   Hey, doggy.
[02:30:17.740 --> 02:30:18.740]   Oh, yeah.
[02:30:18.740 --> 02:30:20.740]   That keeps me working on it.
[02:30:20.740 --> 02:30:21.740]   Thank you very much.
[02:30:21.740 --> 02:30:24.740]   - And of course, the man with all the colors, well, at least
[02:30:24.740 --> 02:30:26.740]   six of them from six colors.
[02:30:26.740 --> 02:30:27.740]   - I got it.
[02:30:27.740 --> 02:30:29.740]   - There's only five Apple product categories.
[02:30:29.740 --> 02:30:33.740]   So I really got a color to spare if they invent something new.
[02:30:33.740 --> 02:30:34.740]   - You're ready.
[02:30:34.740 --> 02:30:35.740]   - I'm ready.
[02:30:35.740 --> 02:30:39.740]   - Six colors.com/json for all the many various things he does.
[02:30:39.740 --> 02:30:44.740]   He wears a coat of many colors and @jsonsnell on the Twitter
[02:30:44.740 --> 02:30:45.740]   verse.
[02:30:45.740 --> 02:30:47.740]   Thank you always, Jason.
[02:30:47.740 --> 02:30:48.740]   Really appreciate it.
[02:30:48.740 --> 02:30:49.740]   - Thank you, Leah.
[02:30:49.740 --> 02:30:50.740]   - Alex, thank you, Andy.
[02:30:50.740 --> 02:30:52.740]   Thanks to all of you for joining us.
[02:30:52.740 --> 02:30:55.740]   We do Mac break weekly on Tuesdays, 11 AM Pacific 2 PM
[02:30:55.740 --> 02:30:56.740]   Eastern right after iOS today.
[02:30:56.740 --> 02:31:00.740]   You know, start your day with Micah and Rosemary and then
[02:31:00.740 --> 02:31:02.740]   continue through with Mac break weekly and then security now to
[02:31:02.740 --> 02:31:03.740]   wrap it up.
[02:31:03.740 --> 02:31:04.740]   Oh, and all about Android.
[02:31:04.740 --> 02:31:05.740]   It's a great Tuesday.
[02:31:05.740 --> 02:31:10.740]   It's a great day for technology on Twitlive.Twit.tv
[02:31:10.740 --> 02:31:12.740]   anytime of the day or night to see what's going on.
[02:31:12.740 --> 02:31:17.740]   If you're watching live, chat live in our IRC, IRC.Twit.tv

[02:31:29.740 --> 02:31:30.740]   weekly.
[02:31:30.740 --> 02:31:32.740]   In fact, probably the easiest way to do that is go to the Twit
[02:31:32.740 --> 02:31:34.740]   YouTube channel, youtube.com/twit.
[02:31:34.740 --> 02:31:38.740]   There's links to all the other shows from there and maybe the

[02:31:42.740 --> 02:31:45.740]   available because it's a podcast.
[02:31:45.740 --> 02:31:48.740]   Just get your favorite podcast to happen and subscribe.
[02:31:48.740 --> 02:31:49.740]   There you go.
[02:31:49.740 --> 02:31:51.740]   Thanks everybody.

[02:31:58.740 --> 02:31:59.740]   Bye bye.
[02:31:59.740 --> 02:32:02.740]   Oh hey, that's a really nice iPhone you have there.
[02:32:02.740 --> 02:32:04.740]   You totally picked the right color.
[02:32:04.740 --> 02:32:08.740]   Hey, since you do use an iPhone and maybe use an iPad or an
[02:32:08.740 --> 02:32:12.740]   Apple Watch or an Apple TV, well, you should check out iOS
[02:32:12.740 --> 02:32:13.740]   today.

[02:32:26.740 --> 02:32:28.740]   And we love to give you tips and tricks about making the most
[02:32:28.740 --> 02:32:32.740]   of those devices, checking out great apps and services and
