[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.720]   going on in the wonder, wonder, wonder land,
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.520]   the never, never land, the fairy land that
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.560]   is Cupertino, California, home of the soon-to-be home
[00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.760]   of the giant spaceship from another planet.
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.760]   Ladies and gentlemen, to join us on the panel today
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.360]   from the Pixelcore at pixelcore.com, Mr. Alex Lindsey.
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.960]   I'd like to think of it as a high-tech lifesaver.
[00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:29.720]   It looks like that.
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:30.560]   A donut.
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.060]   Yes.
[00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.880]   A hammer-ride pillow.
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:32.560]   I think lifesaver.
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.880]   Landing on Cupertino to protect its bottoms.
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.080]   They should just land it.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.960]   They should go to somewhere else and they should land it there.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:39.560]   Wouldn't that be fun?
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.360]   Yeah, build it somewhere else and float it in.
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.080]   Yeah, that'd be great.
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.600]   Hover it in.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.880]   Also with us from Chicago, Illinois, via Boston,
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.720]   the celestial-based of Wannbitts, Mr. himself, Mr. Ani and Naco.
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.200]   Well, we decided to consolidate all the flyby states
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.840]   to one giant Metroplex.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.440]   Because Californians don't believe that East of the Mississippi.
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.160]   There's New York, there's Boston.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.840]   There's New York, there's Florida, and that's it.
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.640]   And apparently you are deep under the sea of Easter Island
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.120]   because I see a teaky god there on your screen.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.520]   No, I've added an ROV.
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.240]   So right now that somewhere on should be the eastern--
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.480]   a fixture in the Maranas trench known as Thor's Twins.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.360]   So basically, you go in through there
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.320]   and then you can go up to 9,000 feet.
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.760]   Amazing.
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.160]   Hopefully, I'm looking for one of the volcanic magnesium
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.000]   anesial fissures that will be able to look and discover
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.840]   new life and perhaps give me something
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.240]   to do on those Thursdays.
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.200]   I mean, what do you do on a Thursday?
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.320]   New as well explore the sea.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.960]   New life or?
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.360]   Jimmy Hoffa.
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.280]   I'm pretty sure if you were down there, he'd be dead.
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.240]   But I'm sure it gives some peace and solace to his family.
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.640]   Absolutely.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.920]   Finally, ladies and gentlemen, from Liverpool in the UK,
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.480]   Mr. Don McAllister of ScreenCasts on line joining us today
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.040]   with his plant.
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.840]   With my plant in the background, am I a nice pink tinge?
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.600]   Yeah, you are a little-- I could fix that.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.320]   I have a--
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.680]   No, it makes me look healthy.
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.160]   I can pretend to fix it.
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.520]   Instead of pasty and pale, you're actually--
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.560]   I think every helper can look healthy, so that's fine.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.000]   Let me play with this here.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.200]   She has to see if I could change your hue to--
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.360]   I have the Photoshop thing in this tricaster where I can--
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.240]   It does match the low of that, don't you?
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.360]   Yeah, you're kind of complementary to our--
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.760]   You know what, Don?
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.160]   I am moving this dial all over the place.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.800]   You are so pink that apparently I can't, in fact, change that.
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.520]   It's all right.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.520]   I can live with that.
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.360]   Maybe I've changed somebody else's hue.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.960]   Your hue is permanenty.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.080]   Well, in that way, here we go.
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.480]   Here we go.
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.560]   No, not a thing.
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.000]   Not even moving the dial.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Could be heat stroker.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.320]   Are you hydrated, Don?
[00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.040]   Oh, there we go.
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.160]   Yeah, now I'm fixing it.
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.240]   Now I'm hydrated.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.360]   I've got my glass of water as well, so I can always throw it.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.960]   Now he's flesh-colored.
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:03.560]   I've gone brown.
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.800]   He looks like a giant thumb.
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.960]   With a mustache.
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.280]   Don, thank you for being here.
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.680]   I'm sorry.
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.760]   We didn't mean to insult you right before the show began.
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.560]   We decided to wait till the show started.
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.440]   Hello, everybody.
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:17.440]   Thank you for joining us.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.880]   And once again, we bring you the news of the Macintosh world.
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.680]   There is some interesting news about the iPhone 5.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.320]   We're hearing lots of reports now from Digitimes, which
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:39.300]   is the Taiwanese supplier newsletter, a report that
[00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.360]   Pegatron, which makes laptops normally,
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.120]   has received orders for 15 million iPhones.
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.000]   Now the original Digitimes reports
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.440]   said the iPhone 5, but then they also
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.360]   said that the hardware is surprisingly similar to the iPhone
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.600]   4.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.040]   That sounds to me like it's the 4S, not the 5.
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.560]   That's good, because then my wife won't notice,
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:57.080]   because she just bought the iPhone.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.320]   Did she really?
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.800]   She asked me.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.440]   She actually asked me.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.040]   She's like, so when is the new iPhone coming out?
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.600]   I'm like, you know what?
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.760]   You're never going to know when the iPhone's going to come out.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.840]   She doesn't use it hard enough.
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:05.400]   No, she should buy.
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.560]   I think the 4S are going to get the phone.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.200]   The only problem with the 4S is so fragile.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.560]   My son took a dip with his 4 yesterday.
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.840]   And it's because the screen was cracked and the circuits
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:14.440]   were exposed.
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:20.240]   I didn't really survive the plunge.
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.000]   You're not supposed to swim with the iPhone.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.400]   And especially if the iPhone's circuitry board is
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.920]   bared to the world, so I'd call you guys.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.480]   I would like them to go back to a plastic back
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.280]   or something like that.
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.240]   It's the glass on the back.
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.040]   Well, it looks like the 4S looks just
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:39.280]   like the Samsung Galaxy S, which is plastic and curved.
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.840]   And I would bet Gorilla Glass, although it doesn't
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.400]   use its own kind of--
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.120]   It's pretty hard glass.
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.960]   --hard glass.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:46.760]   But I wish it wasn't--
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:47.800]   It breaks so easily, though.
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.040]   I have to say, both my kids have broken their iPhones
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.360]   multiple times.
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.560]   And my father bought one and broke it in two days.
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.080]   Two days.
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.320]   Dropped it, broke it.
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.320]   And I find that even with the iPad 2,
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.760]   my kids play with the iPad 1, my old iPad 1.
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.840]   And I'm hesitant to want them to have an iPad 2,
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:06.520]   because--
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.520]   You think it's more breakable?
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.760]   It just feels a lot--
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:09.400]   and I don't know.
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.120]   It just feels a lot more fragile than my more beefy.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.480]   iPad.
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.200]   CNET also has a report that the iPhone 5 and iPad 3
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.040]   will come in October.
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.280]   Andy, what I'm wondering is, do you
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.880]   think there will be two iPhones this fall?
[00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.120]   What is that?
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.880]   No, just saying I've got this fashion accessory on the bottom
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.080]   of the back of my iPhone 4.
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.400]   It's a piece of gaffer tape that's
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.000]   holding some crack glass together.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.960]   You too.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:32.720]   Yeah.
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.000]   It was full, because you put things in your pocket,
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.480]   and then you bend down to pick something up some groceries
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.000]   and it falls out, then--
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.040]   Lisa, my business partner, Lisa,
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.000]   broke hers in two days.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.200]   It fell out of her pocket.
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.840]   And it's only $20 repair.
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.240]   It's an easy thing for them to fix.
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.200]   But I feel as though I need to remind myself,
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.480]   we need to take better care of our toys.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.880]   So if we see the--
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.880]   if we see the next-- whenever the next iPhone is,
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.840]   we see it, then it does not have glass on the back of it.
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.120]   I think that'll be the lesson.
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.240]   All along, I've wondered if part of that decision
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.800]   was to make sure that at one side of this thing
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.840]   is going to break, absorb the impact by fracturing.
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.080]   They'd much rather have a $20 piece of glass
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.400]   that is easily to replace in the back,
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.040]   rather than have the screen crack
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.160]   and just sort of total the entire phone.
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:18.640]   Who knows?
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.440]   It's going to take years before we find out
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.400]   whether it was just an aesthetic choice or whatever.
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.520]   Don, did you-- I'm sorry.
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.320]   Yeah, I must be really lucky, because I
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.600]   have dropped my phone a couple of times,
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.800]   but it's never been of sufficient height
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.080]   to make the glass crack.
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:31.760]   So I've been lucky.
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.560]   But I have to say that iPad 2 does feel a lot slippier,
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.480]   and it does feel a lot more fragile.
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:37.920]   And also, I've had a few narrow escapes
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.360]   with the smart cover detaching from the magnet.
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.840]   You know, if you pick it up in a slightly wrong way,
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.360]   it is very easy to actually break that magnetic seal.
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:47.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:48.600]   It falls off all the time, yeah.
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.160]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.440]   You've got to be really careful with that.
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:54.200]   Digitimes also says that a number of Taiwanese-based companies
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.840]   that supply up with parts for its gadgets
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.040]   have begun to prepare materials for an iPad 3
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.800]   or an X-generation iPad that is, quote, "even thinner and lighter,"
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:08.520]   end quote, as well as supporting a 250 pixels per inch display,
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:11.720]   not quite the 326 of the retina.
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:16.360]   But still, I think, what is the current PPI of the iPad 2?
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:17.640]   It's lower than that.
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.760]   I believe it's 160s up like that.
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.000]   Yeah, so 250 would be noticeably nicer.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.720]   That would get us to that 2K image
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.840]   that we're talking about, or close to it.
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:27.920]   You know, so it'd be the--
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:28.880]   HD by--
[00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.840]   --the VHD by 1080 year.
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:32.120]   Well, it's not 63, so--
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.000]   --it'd be 1920 buying.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.720]   Or would Apple do a 16-3 iPad?
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:37.840]   I don't think they would.
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.080]   I hope they don't, actually.
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.680]   I think it kind of screws up a lot of things.
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:44.320]   Yeah, I have the 169 Samsung.
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.520]   And when you're reading, it's weird.
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:48.240]   It's a little too tall.
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:50.120]   It's like the reason--
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.080]   is the reason why legal-sized paper never really
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.880]   caught on us as a law of community.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.440]   There's just something about that aspect ratio
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:01.760]   of a regular sheet of paper that, at least for every generation
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.120]   above the age of eight right now, is just right.
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.280]   And the longer version is just wrong.
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:08.480]   Well, I think there's a lot of--
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.760]   for people who are doing video, one of the things
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.920]   we've been playing with is designing some interfaces
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:12.560]   for playback.
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.880]   And it's really nice to have 1024 by 768
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.200]   if you have a 960 by 540 frame, you know, video frame.
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:19.320]   You can put other things around it.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.160]   No one's really doing that.
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.840]   You don't mind the black bars, but you--
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.600]   What we want to do is move that up a little bit
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.960]   and then use that real estate below it to add more detail.
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.160]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:27.680]   More data so forth.
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.240]   Yeah, that's a good way to do it.
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.640]   Digitimes does say that no, in fact, there
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.000]   won't be two iPhones.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.560]   They say no, this--
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.880]   The next iPhone will be very much like the current iPhone
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.880]   and not a big jump forward.
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.560]   That can't be right.
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.080]   If I were to take a guess, it would
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.480]   be that we're going to see a minor update sometime this year
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.040]   and then we're going to see an iPhone 5 next year.
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.320]   I certainly don't see Apple releasing two phones
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:51.360]   at the same time.
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:51.860]   OK.
[00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.000]   But what about the A5?
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.080]   Don't they want to get that A5 chip into their phone?
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.240]   To what practical end?
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.400]   Well, they're facing a number of Android phones
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.240]   and more all the time with dual-core processors.
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:06.600]   Apple has never been the business of saying,
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.720]   we want to beat our competitors in Gizmodo when they
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:13.040]   have that side-by-side table of bullet points.
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.440]   It's always going to be--
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:16.760]   they always advertise based on here's
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:20.680]   how easy it is to read this incredibly high density display.
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.600]   Here's how responsive the interface is.
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.920]   Even when they do have really great hardware inside,
[00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:27.840]   you will never find out how many cores the processors.
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.360]   You will never find out how much on-board cash there is.
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:32.520]   That's not something they really care about enough
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.720]   to sell that point to consumers.
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.480]   So every time that I look at--
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.400]   every time there's a new rumor about a new feature for a new iPad
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:42.080]   or a new phone, the thing that I ask myself is,
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.080]   so how are they going to translate this
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.520]   into something that the average consumer will
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:47.560]   be able to appreciate?
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.760]   So a higher density display on the iPad,
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:51.720]   I can sort of get that because they can say,
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.200]   now you can watch movies in full HD.
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.160]   They're not going to do it just because they're
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:59.680]   worried that the new HP tablet has eight more pixels
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.960]   per inch than an existing iPad.
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:06.720]   I do admit, I find that it's pokey.
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:07.720]   I really feel like--
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:08.600]   You feel it's slow?
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:11.040]   I feel like my iPhone 4 is slow.
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.800]   I felt like when I first got it, maybe it's something wrong
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:13.760]   with it or something like that.
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.840]   But I find myself, I have a bad habit of shaking it.
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.280]   Like it's going to make it go faster.
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.200]   Like I hit a new app and I'm like, come on.
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:21.640]   Does that work with your children too, Alex?
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:23.200]   Yeah, no, no.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.200]   I don't want to.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:24.720]   Yeah.
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.240]   I mean, I think they will make the play.
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.240]   I think they'll go down the-- if they're not going to bring out
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.880]   completely brand new iPhone 5, that they'll make a play
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.200]   for the performance aspect of it.
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.200]   And they might just include the dual processor as a side
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:35.920]   comment.
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:37.720]   But I mean, they did the same with the 4S,
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.040]   didn't they, when they came out, the S stood for speed.
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:43.160]   So they definitely do see the performance of the phone
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.200]   as being a selling point.
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.120]   So if there aren't any major features,
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.320]   we'll very much might see the dual processor.
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.480]   In fact, I'd be surprised if we didn't, to be honest.
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.600]   I'd be happy if they just made the iPhone more durable.
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.600]   I'll take the same iPhone.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:55.920]   Thank you.
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.640]   Just make it so it doesn't break so easily.
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:11:59.400]   Does that--
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:11:59.900]   Do it?
[00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:01.640]   Is that something Apple could conceivably do?
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.600]   It's called an Otterbox.
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.360]   Yeah, maybe just a better case.
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.560]   What do you got on yours?
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.360]   You look like you have some pretty heavy duty on yours.
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:08.960]   On mine?
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:09.560]   Was it yours?
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.960]   I saw some-- oh, no, no.
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:13.520]   The guy behind you has got a big old mo--
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.120]   is it a mophie?
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.880]   Big old case.
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:18.760]   You can't know we could see him so as an appointment.
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:19.200]   Bring it on.
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.200]   Oh, it's just a rubber band.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.460]   A rubber-- oh, you got the Apple.
[00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:22.260]   Never mind.
[00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:23.440]   He's got the exact opposite.
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:26.160]   He's got the little Apple case on that thing.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.560]   That's guaranteed to let your phone break.
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:32.000]   First time it hits something.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.240]   Yeah, I've got a couple different cases.
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.240]   The battery case, the gimbal case, which is probably--
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:40.400]   I have a tough case upstairs, like you could throw the thing.
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.440]   In fact, the ads, they actually drop it off
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.680]   the roof of a building.
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:44.680]   Right.
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:45.960]   But it's ugly.
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.160]   I don't-- this is the problem.
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:51.280]   You make a gorgeous phone, and then you put in an ugly case.
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.280]   Well, what?
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.260]   Yeah.
[00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.020]   I mean, I started off with the band,
[00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:57.260]   but I've long since given that up.
[00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:59.340]   In a case, I use my mophie when I need the extra battery life.
[00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:01.500]   But normally, I just use the Play-N-O phone.
[00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:03.300]   It seems to slip in your pocket a lot easier as well,
[00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:06.100]   if you haven't got any with nice glass sights.
[00:13:06.100 --> 00:13:08.580]   So I tend to keep mine without it's--
[00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:11.500]   For me, the big worry has always been not
[00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:13.340]   so much protection so much as I really
[00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:15.940]   think you need to have that strip of rubber that just
[00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:17.740]   keeps it from sliding around.
[00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:19.100]   To something grip it on.
[00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:20.740]   Yeah, I didn't have it in the bumper case
[00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:21.780]   when it fell out of my pocket.
[00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:24.820]   I kind of think that if I'd had some rubber in there,
[00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:26.380]   it's not like I was hanging upside down
[00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.180]   to pick up this thing off the sidewalk.
[00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:30.580]   I think it would have stuck to my shirt pop a little bit better
[00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:32.060]   if I had some rubber on it.
[00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:35.800]   You know, we may say that Apple doesn't need to do a new phone,
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.540]   but the investing community does.
[00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:40.060]   Bloomberg reports that Apple shares dropped 3 and 1/2%
[00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:43.420]   this month, capping their worst first half performance
[00:13:43.420 --> 00:13:44.740]   in three years.
[00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:47.660]   Bloomberg says its investors are waiting for new products
[00:13:47.660 --> 00:13:51.820]   and worried about Google.
[00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:53.340]   I don't know if stock prices are a good way
[00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:56.300]   to predict what Apple's about to do, to be honest.
[00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:59.700]   But obviously, the market thinks that there's going to be--
[00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:01.380]   I don't know if the market's always right.
[00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:01.880]   Yeah.
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.780]   I've never had any faith in that.
[00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:07.380]   I would love to see market analysts be like sports writers
[00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:10.500]   in the late '40s saying, oh, Ted Williams batting average
[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:13.740]   this season went down three points to $397.
[00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:14.980]   It's all over for the splendid--
[00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:16.540]   I have to try to trade them.
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:17.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:19.980]   It is kind of like that, actually.
[00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:20.820]   Oh, no.
[00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:22.100]   3 and 1/2% down.
[00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:23.980]   Oh, no.
[00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:26.300]   When I talk to these analysts-- and I always
[00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:28.700]   have to use it in my dumb voice because I am dumb when it comes
[00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:31.540]   to the business side of that sort of stuff.
[00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:34.180]   And really, they've never been able to sway me
[00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:38.220]   from the idea that according to Wall Street, every year
[00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:42.500]   has to be-- every year, Apple has
[00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:45.860]   to have the greatest year they've ever had ever.
[00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:47.300]   It's not just Apple, though.
[00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:50.060]   That's the tech investor, right?
[00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:51.180]   That's true for everybody.
[00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:53.100]   But it's just ridiculous to assume that-- well,
[00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:56.220]   realize that last year they introduced a brand new product
[00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:59.340]   that didn't exist before that had no competition for,
[00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:00.860]   and that two years later, they're still
[00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:03.220]   making money hand over fist, but now there are eight other people
[00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:05.460]   who are making just as good little smartphones.
[00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:08.060]   So maybe this is not the year that they're going to, again,
[00:15:08.060 --> 00:15:09.900]   hit 450 instead of 400.
[00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.620]   Well, and I think that one of the things
[00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:13.740]   when we talk about Apple's big savings account,
[00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:15.300]   the $70 billion--
[00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:16.780]   Is that what it's up to now?
[00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:17.340]   I think it's 70.
[00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:19.140]   It might be 75 billion.
[00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:23.500]   That is a big-- that's FU money to Wall Street.
[00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:27.300]   That's kind of like-- they don't care.
[00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:29.660]   If you want to ride along and buy some of their stock,
[00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:30.980]   that's everyone gets to play along,
[00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:33.700]   but they no longer need you.
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.900]   From a publicly traded company, sometimes I wonder
[00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:39.260]   when I see that number getting bigger and bigger and bigger,
[00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:44.620]   where their Steve is secretly planning to buy Apple back
[00:15:44.620 --> 00:15:46.940]   and stop becoming a public company.
[00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:50.660]   That would be one really interesting use of all that cash.
[00:15:50.660 --> 00:15:51.420]   That's a nice threat.
[00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:53.420]   Say, well, if you're unhappy with the profits we're making
[00:15:53.420 --> 00:15:55.300]   you right now, we'll buy your stock
[00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:57.260]   and keep the profits for ourselves.
[00:15:57.260 --> 00:15:58.260]   Yeah.
[00:15:58.260 --> 00:16:00.460]   If the stock dropped enough, I think that Apple might be--
[00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:03.060]   It's not unusual to have a stock buy back to show--
[00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:05.420]   for a company to show its faith in the stock,
[00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:06.660]   of course, the Apple hasn't needed to do that
[00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:09.660]   because the stock has been so strong for so long.
[00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:12.220]   But other companies-- I think Microsoft's done stock buyback.
[00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:12.940]   So I know each of those--
[00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:13.940]   Apple's so uninterested in the market, though.
[00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:16.700]   I wonder whether they just want to buy back the--
[00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:18.140]   Why not?
[00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:19.540]   Go back to being private.
[00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:20.140]   You know why?
[00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:21.260]   Because it's so expensive right now.
[00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:22.940]   I mean, the stock is still-- what is it?
[00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:23.820]   $300 some bucks.
[00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:24.540]   No, it would have to drop.
[00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:24.940]   A lot.
[00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:27.140]   It would have to drop a lot.
[00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:28.700]   I don't think they're betting on that.
[00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:29.020]   No.
[00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:33.100]   Verizon tomorrow, no day after tomorrow,
[00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:38.140]   eliminates the unlimited data plans.
[00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:40.300]   Verizon like AT&T going tiered.
[00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:44.300]   They call it usage-based billing.
[00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:46.740]   So are you paranoid of changing your AT&T?
[00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:49.380]   Because yesterday when my wife was setting up,
[00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:50.700]   the guy got on the phone with me and he said,
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:52.020]   you know, you can change your text messaging.
[00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:52.780]   You'll save some money.
[00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:54.260]   And I was like, boom, boom, boom, no, no, no.
[00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:54.660]   They try to do that.
[00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:56.900]   Do not change anything about my account.
[00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.420]   Like, I was like, you know--
[00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:00.260]   I wish you'd asked him.
[00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:00.900]   OK.
[00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:03.900]   Does that mean now that I have another two years on my deal?
[00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:05.660]   Does that mean my data plan changes?
[00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:06.420]   Tell me what the effect--
[00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:08.540]   No, he said it does not affect my data plan.
[00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:09.460]   He assured me.
[00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:12.140]   But I was like, I'm not talking to some Yahoo at a store
[00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:12.940]   and have him come with it.
[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:13.420]   Yeah, what are you going to do?
[00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:15.140]   Because once they take it away, they're not going to give it back.
[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:17.020]   And I was like, well, the yuts on the phone told me.
[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:19.660]   Yeah, I was like, let's just leave it exactly the way it is.
[00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:20.780]   I'll pay the extra money.
[00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:22.500]   Well, two things on that.
[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.940]   I did change my text messaging plan
[00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:28.140]   because I added one more person who
[00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:30.900]   I exchanged just enough text messages
[00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:35.060]   with to make the extra $5 a very, very much worth the money.
[00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:36.780]   And he's got a girlfriend.
[00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:38.580]   And he's got a girlfriend.
[00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:40.580]   No, I don't.
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:45.300]   I found out that the thing is Leonard Nimoy has switched carriers
[00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:47.660]   and he forgot the highest text messaging number.
[00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:50.180]   I have friend Lenny.
[00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:53.620]   And that didn't affect my unlimited data on my iPhone.
[00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:56.460]   The other shocking piece of information--
[00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:58.580]   and this is something that another one of those instances
[00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:00.900]   where I asked the same question three times in a row
[00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:03.260]   because I'm sure I've misunderstood--
[00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:06.380]   someone was talking to me about how they had--
[00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:07.620]   they had an original iPad.
[00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:10.980]   They had the original unlimited data plan.
[00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:12.740]   Their credit card expired.
[00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:14.980]   They forgot to update it with the new information.
[00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:16.180]   And so it lapsed.
[00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:17.500]   And so they had to re-sign up again.
[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:23.100]   And now they're on the limited the capped bandwidth.
[00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:25.820]   They called, said there was a mix up with the credit card.
[00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:32.500]   And the AT&T rep allowed him to switch back to unlimited data.
[00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:33.740]   No.
[00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:34.700]   Yes.
[00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:38.300]   And made it very clear to him that this is not
[00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:39.780]   an item that's on the price list.
[00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:41.860]   We can do this for you exactly once.
[00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:45.100]   And if your iPad is stolen, you replace it,
[00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:48.300]   or something else happens, we won't be able to ever do this
[00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:50.700]   for you again, but you are back on unlimited data.
[00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:51.540]   Interesting.
[00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:52.980]   If that sort of thing ever happens to you,
[00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:55.780]   it's certainly worth calling and just checking to see.
[00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:57.100]   Verizon, go ahead.
[00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.260]   I relinquished mine.
[00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:01.980]   From my original iPhone, I had the unlimited data plan.
[00:19:01.980 --> 00:19:05.780]   But recently, my vendor sort of came up
[00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:07.980]   with a different type of plan that included tethering
[00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:08.980]   at no extra cost.
[00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:11.540]   But you lose your unlimited data.
[00:19:11.540 --> 00:19:12.900]   And I thought, well, you know, I don't really use--
[00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:14.020]   That's a good deal.
[00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:16.540]   Anyone near the amount of data that I
[00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:19.180]   thought would on the phone, because I'm nearly always on Wi-Fi.
[00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:21.300]   So I thought, oh, OK, I'll do it now.
[00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:23.020]   So now I've got tethering on my phone.
[00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:24.260]   And I've lost my unlimited data.
[00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:24.780]   That's worth it.
[00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:25.620]   I think that's worth it.
[00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:26.620]   I would do that.
[00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:28.140]   Because by the way, Don's in the UK,
[00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:31.540]   this is not something probably offered by AT&T or Verizon.
[00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:32.580]   But probably not.
[00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:33.420]   Yeah, probably not.
[00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:35.180]   But that's interesting, though.
[00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:38.820]   Late this year, when iCloud becomes available for every Mac
[00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:42.860]   and every iOS device, I'm really curious to see how
[00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:46.060]   my own 3G data use is going to be affected.
[00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:49.100]   Because I really do intend to use iCloud pretty heavily
[00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:51.500]   for at least for keeping documents in sync and stuff
[00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:52.100]   like that.
[00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:54.940]   That actually was my question, which is really a tempest
[00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:56.940]   in the teapot, do we really care about unlimited data?
[00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:59.540]   But yes, we will, is what you're saying.
[00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:03.140]   And it's not as though it would be really desirable for us
[00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:04.700]   to always be sinking over 3G.
[00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:06.220]   There will always be--
[00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:08.460]   it's not as though 3G unlimited means
[00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:11.340]   that you never have an awareness that here are eight places
[00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:15.700]   within site of 128 of this exit where you can get free Wi-Fi.
[00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:17.900]   But if you're in a position where you're
[00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:21.460]   transacting hundreds and hundreds of megabytes of just
[00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:24.260]   updates and just pushing sync items out,
[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:26.900]   right now it looks like the fact that it's just pushing out
[00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:30.100]   changes in not original docs, that hopefully should mitigate
[00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:30.620]   things a bit.
[00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:33.860]   But there's going to have to be a new reality about how much
[00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:37.540]   data that you use over 3G now that when iCloud gets into the
[00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:38.260]   picture.
[00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:44.980]   The Verizon pricing, $10 for 75 megabytes.
[00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:46.260]   That's a joke.
[00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:47.100]   That's adorable.
[00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:48.180]   Isn't that cute?
[00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:51.100]   That's for Barbies, I thought.
[00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:53.260]   I would like you smack you in the face right now.
[00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:54.180]   What?
[00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:55.900]   That's 75 megabytes, thank you very much.
[00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:57.700]   $30 for two gigs.
[00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:00.060]   Two gigs is not unreasonable.
[00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:02.100]   30 bucks for it, it seems a little stiff.
[00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:02.580]   Yeah, that's pricey.
[00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:04.300]   $50 for five gigabytes.
[00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:05.500]   Now, let me ask you this.
[00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:09.340]   Isn't unlimited data on Verizon and 18 to five gigabytes
[00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:10.300]   unlimited?
[00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:11.660]   Or is it unlimited, unlimited?
[00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:13.340]   I never get a straight answer on this.
[00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:14.500]   Anybody know?
[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:17.100]   I believe they define unlimited as five gigabytes.
[00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:17.660]   I think so.
[00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:21.380]   So what we're talking about is $50 for five gigs, which is
[00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:23.860]   essentially what you're getting now.
[00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:25.620]   And then $80 for 10 gigs.
[00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:28.340]   Now, I think that that might, for some, that might be a good
[00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:29.100]   plan.
[00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:31.900]   $10 a gigabyte if you go over your allotment, that's the
[00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:35.180]   difference, because even though the unlimited was five gigs,
[00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:37.620]   they wouldn't necessarily ding you at six or seven gigs.
[00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:40.300]   It might take a while before they start dinging you.
[00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:43.180]   And the $10 is actually a lot better than like a MyFi is
[00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:44.940]   $50 a gig?
[00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:45.340]   A gig?
[00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:45.900]   Extra.
[00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:46.780]   Extra.
[00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:47.780]   $10 a gig extra.
[00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:49.540]   So let me just do some math.
[00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:53.420]   If you bought the two gig plan, which many would, for $30,
[00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:55.740]   you go to $30 gigs, it's $40.
[00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:57.300]   You go to $40 gigs is $50.
[00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:59.300]   It's not going to kill you.
[00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:00.300]   Right.
[00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:03.740]   But it's slightly more than you would pay if you bought it
[00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:04.220]   ahead of time.
[00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:06.460]   And that's exactly how the pricing should be.
[00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:08.820]   I think people really just need to start right now, making
[00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:10.340]   sure that they keep an eye on--
[00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:12.620]   Through system press.
[00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:14.420]   Keep an eye on how much they're trending a month.
[00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:15.260]   I was surprised.
[00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:18.300]   I thought that was a pretty heavy 3G user, because I will be
[00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:19.980]   in Panera working for two hours.
[00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:21.500]   I don't even bother connecting to the Wi-Fi.
[00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:23.260]   I'll just use 3G all the way.
[00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:28.380]   And even so, exceeding two gigs was a really profoundly rare
[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:28.900]   experience.
[00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:31.660]   I have to aggressively be hitting the Netflix and hitting
[00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:34.380]   the Slungbox in order to get anywhere north of that.
[00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:36.820]   So any of the iPad, though, I did go through 30 gigs in a
[00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:38.020]   month.
[00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:39.260]   So it was the iPad.
[00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:40.380]   But that's different maybe.
[00:22:40.380 --> 00:22:41.460]   And the use is padded.
[00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:43.620]   When it's a different-- maybe I forgot to turn on Wi-Fi
[00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:44.140]   or something.
[00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:44.620]   I don't know.
[00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:45.380]   Good point.
[00:22:45.380 --> 00:22:46.060]   Hey, let's take a break.
[00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:49.420]   We've got a great cast of crew of people here, including
[00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:51.340]   the lovely Alex Lindsey.
[00:22:51.340 --> 00:22:55.140]   The eloquent Andy Inatko and the pink Don McCallister.
[00:22:55.140 --> 00:23:00.060]   All here to talk to you about your iPad and your iPhone.
[00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:03.620]   And yes, we have Macintosh news coming in moments.
[00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:07.020]   But before I do that, I want to talk to you about Gazelle.
[00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:08.220]   Now, here's a great thing.
[00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:11.820]   If you've got an iPhone right now and the new iPhone does
[00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:15.420]   come out soon, you will be very happy to know about Gazelle.
[00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:16.900]   You might want to jot this down.
[00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:19.900]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com.
[00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:24.340]   Gazelle is a way that you can recycle or sell your used
[00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:28.180]   gadgets, all that stuff lying around your house.
[00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:29.060]   Don't sell it.
[00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:30.500]   Gazelle it.
[00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:34.940]   They will send you cash or an Amazon gift card, a variety
[00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:36.260]   of different payment plans.
[00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:37.900]   I think you could even a little bit more if you get the
[00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:40.260]   Amazon gift card.
[00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:41.980]   Excuse me.
[00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:44.620]   And I'm going to tell you how you can get 5% bonus in just a
[00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:45.780]   second.
[00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:47.140]   First, let me explain how this works.
[00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:48.820]   You go to Gazelle.com.
[00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:50.180]   By the way, notice this, your data is safe.
[00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:51.700]   They wipe your data.
[00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:53.340]   So you don't have to worry about that.
[00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:54.500]   Yeah, and let's say I've got--
[00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:56.220]   I've been working on iPhone 3.
[00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:57.940]   Did they just put it over a bulky racer?
[00:23:57.940 --> 00:23:59.540]   No, I don't think so.
[00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:01.380]   They have data specialists.
[00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:04.140]   I've got a 32 gigabyte 3GS.
[00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:05.420]   My wife's phone.
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:07.900]   My phone is no noticeable flaws.
[00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:09.860]   It looks like it's never been used.
[00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:12.180]   I'll be honest.
[00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:13.980]   It's slight wear, faint scratches.
[00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:15.300]   I'm going to be honest here.
[00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:17.180]   By the way, they'll give you a quote, but they will--
[00:24:17.180 --> 00:24:18.940]   they reserve the right to modify that quote.
[00:24:18.940 --> 00:24:20.300]   It's free of water damage.
[00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:22.300]   If they get the phone there, it's got a big scratch down
[00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:22.740]   the screen.
[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:24.060]   What?
[00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:25.580]   Holy moly.
[00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:28.420]   185 bucks for that old 3GS.
[00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:30.260]   That's fantastic.
[00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:32.140]   That means I'm going to really almost be able to pay for
[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:33.940]   that new phone for Jennifer.
[00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:34.980]   Well, I'm excited about that.
[00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:36.300]   So here's what happens.
[00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:37.180]   There you go.
[00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:38.300]   There's the offer.
[00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:40.700]   Now, I get a box, and they will, by the way, give me a
[00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:42.160]   mailing label, so I don't pay for shipping.
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:43.780]   I just-- and this is--
[00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:46.620]   when I add the box, you'll see that I can add as many things
[00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:47.540]   to the boxes I want.
[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:49.180]   In fact, this is probably a good idea to go through the
[00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:51.180]   garage, find all sorts of stuff.
[00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:53.100]   Got more stuff to sell.
[00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:54.100]   Old satellite radios.
[00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:56.700]   I do have an XM.
[00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:59.780]   An old XM radio that I would just love to get rid of.
[00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:00.340]   Yeah, that's it.
[00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:02.060]   It's the Delphi sky.
[00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:02.340]   Let's see.
[00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:03.980]   Is it no noticeable flaws in the app?
[00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:05.620]   Because it's still in the box.
[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:06.700]   I never use it.
[00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:07.940]   Anyway, so you go through this.
[00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:11.500]   And this is fun, kind of to go through.
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:17.200]   Because as you go through it, $8 shows you a valuable XM
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.120]   radio is.
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:20.080]   There will be stuff that-- there will be stuff that--
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:20.720]   I'll do another one.
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:21.520]   Let me do another one.
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.960]   Not even a large cheese pizza, I know.
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:24.480]   It's sad.
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:27.400]   Well, nobody really wants it.
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:29.440]   In fact, please, I can get eight bucks for it.
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:30.640]   Occasionally, you'll get stuff.
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:32.480]   Let's say I have a laptop in here.
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:35.680]   I'm going to say it's a Compaq.
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:36.840]   Yeah, this is my item.
[00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:38.080]   Sell it now.
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:40.760]   And then I say in the condition, it has functional or
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:42.280]   physical problems to prevent use.
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:43.560]   Let's face it, sometimes it happens.
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:45.320]   But don't feel bad about that.
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:46.600]   They're not going to give me any money.
[00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:48.760]   But what I'm going to do is press the recycle button.
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:50.520]   And they will recycle this for you.
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:52.260]   So add everything to the box.
[00:25:52.260 --> 00:25:53.720]   Some of it will be money for you.
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.800]   Some of it, they'll just get rid of responsibly.
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:56.720]   And I like that.
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:00.760]   They use EPA-certified US-based recyclers.
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:03.000]   They guarantee none of it will end up in the landfill.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.480]   It's all recycled responsibly and environmentally safely.
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:10.320]   And their data security means that all of the data that's
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:11.200]   on there will be wiped.
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:14.640]   They have a gadget lab team that hands inspects every device,
[00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:18.280]   wipes all the personal data before it's reused or recycled.
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:20.440]   So Cloud Blue is their current recycler.
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:22.800]   But they have-- they're just really great.
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.240]   One more thing I want to tell you about.
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:27.040]   Gazelle is a great way to raise money for your cause.
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:28.680]   If you have a charity or a school you're
[00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:30.680]   trying to raise money for, forget a bake sale.
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:31.840]   Have a gadget drive.
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:33.640]   You can create a gadget drive page.
[00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:33.920]   Look at this.
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:37.120]   Three items in my box already worth 193 bucks.
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.120]   I'm feeling good about this.
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:42.240]   Trade in your iPad, your iPhone, any old gadget lying around,
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:43.960]   video games, et cetera.
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:45.120]   It's just a great company.
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.160]   We've used them for a long time.
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:47.760]   And I want you to try them right now.
[00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:48.720]   Go to Gazelle.com.
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:51.000]   And remember I said you could make a little extra money?
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.080]   Just because you're listening to Mac Break Weekly.
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:56.560]   When you check out, use the bonus code MacBreak.
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:00.240]   And they will put an additional 5% right on top of that.
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:02.600]   So that's another 10 bucks I'm going to get on this.
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.000]   That's great.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.080]   Gazelle.com, when you check out, use the offer code MacBreak.
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:11.520]   Don't sell it.
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:13.600]   Gazelle it.
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:14.840]   MacBreak Weekly is on the air.
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:19.200]   We thank Gazelle by the way for the support of our fine program.
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.280]   Lion.
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:22.760]   He's apparently gone gold master.
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:23.480]   I'm excited.
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:25.560]   Does that mean any day now?
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:26.560]   It's got to be soon.
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:27.600]   It means damn soon.
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:31.440]   I was expecting it as early as today.
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.640]   But I think that's going to happen sometime in the next couple
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:34.160]   of weeks.
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.840]   I think that I think that the day will actually depend
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:38.880]   on whether or not Apple is planning on releasing hardware
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:40.320]   in the same day.
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:44.160]   If the rumored updates to the MacBook Air are happening
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:46.520]   at the same time, then it's going to happen on a Tuesday.
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:48.240]   If not, if it's just the release of the OS,
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.040]   I'm guessing it's going to happen on a Friday.
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:52.880]   So do you think it'll be this week?
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:55.520]   It could be.
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:59.720]   Unfortunately, there's such a collective.
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:04.080]   The news that the GM had gone-- I was actually--
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.640]   I know people are going to hate another mention of Google+.
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:11.600]   But I was actually doing a Google+ in whatever they call it.
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:15.160]   With eight other people, including two other tech writers.
[00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.840]   And suddenly, it's almost as-- it was
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:19.360]   like that scene in those 1940s movies
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:20.640]   where they're in a movie theater.
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:24.160]   And suddenly, the news comes out that the Japanese have
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:25.080]   attacked Pearl Harbor.
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:27.880]   It's like, oh, no, Lion just went golden master.
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:28.960]   We got to go get home.
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:30.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:32.840]   Because everybody knows that this--
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:34.600]   in case it drops on Tuesday, we're
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:37.200]   going to have to have all of our coverage ready to go.
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.200]   Oh, damn.
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:40.680]   I suppose these hot dogs and the hamburgers will freeze.
[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:41.680]   Damn.
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:42.680]   Ah.
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:43.600]   So I don't know.
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:44.760]   Sometimes the next few weeks.
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:49.040]   But if the GM turns out to be nice and stable,
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:50.800]   I think that we're going to see it pretty soon.
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:51.000]   Yeah.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.320]   See, the thing is, this time round, though,
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:53.960]   because it's being delivered by the Mac App Store,
[00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:56.640]   they don't need a long lead time to get all of media ready.
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:59.520]   And to coordinate activities to get stuff shipped,
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:02.240]   they can just presumably just throw a switch when it is ready.
[00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.280]   That's something that's completely changed, isn't it?
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:04.780]   Yeah.
[00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:06.480]   But I have a feeling--
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:08.040]   and I'm hoping so, because I'm actually
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:09.240]   going on holiday for a week tomorrow.
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.880]   And I hope I don't release it while I'm on holiday.
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:12.880]   I have a feeling that they might wait until after the earnings
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:13.680]   call this month.
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:14.680]   Ah.
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:16.400]   They do this slingshot thing with the earnings call,
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:19.280]   in that they'll have a stellar quarter.
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:21.040]   And then the next day or the day after they
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:22.880]   announced a brand new product, and that sort of gives it
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:23.880]   like a slingshot effect.
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:26.960]   So I'm sort of thinking, although it could drop any day,
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:28.160]   I'm sort of thinking they're going
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.920]   to leave it until after the earnings call list.
[00:29:29.920 --> 00:29:30.720]   What is the--
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.200]   Let's use the new one.
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:32.960]   Is it the 19th?
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:33.480]   Is it?
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.080]   I think it's the 18th or the 19th.
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:35.600]   When is the--
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:36.920]   when is the Apple earnings call?
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:39.040]   They could find that for us.
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:40.560]   There are a number of new features in line.
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:43.000]   This is one I didn't know about that I love.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.320]   They still have the migration manager, but--
[00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:47.200]   It's July 19th and 19th.
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:47.680]   Yeah.
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:49.720]   Let's say the 20th.
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:53.080]   It'll be Wednesday, right after Mac break weekly, of course.
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:55.440]   This can-- remember, you can always transfer data
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:59.480]   from an old Mac, but now you can do it from a PC
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:00.520]   on the same network.
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:02.440]   That is kind of cool, don't you think?
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:04.400]   I mean, I like that idea.
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.480]   Wow.
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:10.840]   If you want lion, though, you should be snow leopard now, right?
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:11.160]   Yep.
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:12.400]   Let's be understanding.
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:15.080]   Because I guess at some point they'll offer a disk,
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:18.520]   but until they do, you'll have to do it in the App Store
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.480]   and you don't have the App Store unless you're snow leopard.
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:23.080]   So there's probably no other way to get it.
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:25.880]   So another reason I ask, I'm sitting in front of a leopard
[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:28.160]   computer, iMac that I haven't upgraded.
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:28.600]   I better--
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:30.080]   You also need a fast connection.
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:31.280]   That dial-up is not going to work.
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:32.360]   Yeah.
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:33.760]   So there are people going to be left in the cold.
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:34.680]   It kept quite a few people.
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:35.680]   Starbucks.
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:37.680]   Starbucks.
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:41.280]   If Starbucks is surprisingly quiet, busy, rather, on July 20th.
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:42.800]   A lot of people with magnetizes in the end.
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:43.720]   You don't have any coffee.
[00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:45.760]   Well, no, why?
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:47.520]   Throwing on the table will go, come online.
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:48.880]   It are not that good, see?
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.440]   There's a lot of jittery people.
[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:51.480]   Starbucks is actually the worst thing,
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.760]   because you'll just get increasingly impatient
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.560]   as you get refills waiting for the thing to do.
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:55.920]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:57.800]   You get jittery.
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:01.560]   So anything we should-- Alex, Andy, Don, anything we should
[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:03.720]   know about lying, anything we should do to prepare for it.
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:05.800]   I know, OK, for one, I've got to put snow leopard on this
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:08.760]   machine, anything else.
[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:10.320]   It's going to be cool.
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:10.800]   Yeah.
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.160]   I don't think about rosetta.
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:13.520]   I don't think about rosetta.
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:14.560]   Rosetta is a problem.
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:18.400]   If you have applications that require rosetta--
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.160]   I'm going to click on--
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:20.320]   You need to move on.
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:21.600]   Yeah, you need to go through and weed
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:23.880]   then out and replace them with something else.
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:25.200]   I mean, it's not like you couldn't put
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:27.360]   lion on that machine, but they just won't work.
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:27.840]   Right.
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:28.320]   That's right.
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:29.600]   Actually, that's an interesting question.
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:31.200]   If I'm upgrading to lion--
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:32.600]   So I have rosetta left over.
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:35.800]   Will it still not work?
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:36.200]   Because doesn't--
[00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:37.280]   Well, rosetta get launched.
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:37.840]   No, I think it doesn't.
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:38.280]   It doesn't.
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:39.480]   No, it won't work.
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:40.440]   OK.
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.960]   It will also move any applications
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:46.120]   that it finds that it's incompatible to a separate area
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:49.320]   so that it will identify those applications that either
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:51.400]   haven't been tested or uncompatiable with lion
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:53.160]   and let you know what they are and you can go ahead
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:56.080]   and try and get updates and stuff.
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:57.720]   I would say that that's--
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:00.040]   normally, it's a good piece of advice
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:03.040]   to always do a complete backup before you
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:06.480]   do a full number of upgrades on any OS.
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:09.200]   This time, it's doubly important, I think,
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.160]   because I'm going to want to make sure that I not only
[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:14.200]   have backups of my OS and a complete image of the hard drive,
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:17.200]   a bootable backup image that can then detach.
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:21.120]   But as I start upgrading apps and all my documents
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:24.560]   start getting switched over from a static format
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:27.360]   to a versioning format, I think that we're
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:30.520]   going to see a lot of problems early.
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:32.640]   I have no specific information, but I
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:35.440]   suspect that a change that is this radical
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:37.400]   means that there's a lot of very subtle problems that aren't
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.880]   really going to manifest themselves until half a million
[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:43.040]   people are pounding up down on the same ladder.
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:45.760]   So the advice is to back up, but would your advice
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:48.880]   be for some to wait and watch what happens?
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:51.200]   Well, that's always smart when this--
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:51.680]   Yeah, but more--
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:52.200]   --is going to do it.
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:53.800]   If you're in the middle of a production,
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:55.440]   if you're just as a production person,
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:57.000]   if you're in the middle of doing something important,
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.960]   in the middle of some kind of project, so on and so forth,
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:32:59.800]   do not upgrade.
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:01.040]   Do not upgrade.
[00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:02.320]   You know, this is--
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:04.680]   Yeah, don't go that path.
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:05.600]   That's all I'm going to do.
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.880]   It just happens as well.
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:08.320]   This week, I did a--
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:11.080]   my screencast online show was all about getting ready for lines.
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:13.080]   I had a feeling it might be.
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:15.400]   So tell us the-- give us a few tidbits
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:17.360]   and save the rest for the people to go next.
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:18.800]   Well, basically what Andy said,
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:19.680]   make sure you have a backup.
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:21.600]   I mean, Apple actually do put a three-stage process
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:23.880]   on their website to say this is how you will upgrade to Lion,
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.920]   but they miss out the backup stage, which is very naughty.
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:28.880]   So, you know, backup is critical, really.
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:30.640]   And always, I always recommend, again,
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:31.840]   that you have a bootable backup.
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:33.600]   So that's not just a time machine backup
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:34.640]   that you can restore your system,
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:36.240]   but, you know, separate, bootable backup.
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:37.320]   It's really easy.
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.560]   In fact, Superduper's just been updated.
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:41.000]   It's now Lion compatible.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.960]   One of the reasons, last time, when a lot of people
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.520]   didn't move across the Snow Leopard,
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:46.200]   was that Superduper took about three months
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:48.680]   to actually test and launch.
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:50.480]   And I know an awful lot of people, myself included,
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:52.720]   was really hesitant about going to Snow Leopard,
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:54.840]   but props to the guys.
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:56.960]   They've actually released the Lion compatible version
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.480]   before Lion was actually out there.
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:33:59.320]   So that's great.
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:01.560]   So go ahead and get Superduper and back it up.
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:05.200]   Let me tell you how dedicated these people are.
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:08.760]   Most of the head of the company is a guy
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:10.400]   by the name of David Nadian.
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:14.400]   He had plans months in advance to leave for Italy
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.640]   for a week for a big bike race.
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:19.840]   The bike race he's been training for for eight or nine months,
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:22.600]   where it's just the Boston Marathon of bike races.
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:25.000]   And when he found out that the Golden Master had dropped,
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.920]   he was basically meant that, okay,
[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:31.440]   I really thought that I'd be spending the next 12 hours
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:33.480]   just sort of casually getting things ready
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:35.240]   and making sure my bike was in order.
[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:39.320]   Instead, everything was done to make sure that he's free to go,
[00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:41.880]   that the app is ready to go, that everything has been fixed
[00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:43.960]   and that there's a big plan for whatever happens
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:45.120]   in the next 10 days.
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:46.280]   So that's dedication.
[00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:47.120]   It's a great app.
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:48.880]   It's the app that I use for backups all the time.
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:52.000]   - Easy OS X and the chat room has pointed me to an article
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.640]   from a week ago at CNET, I'm sorry,
[00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:58.400]   Mac Fixit, the Mac Fixit portion of CNET,
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:00.480]   saying that quick and may run in line
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:04.640]   because Apple's very aware of how many people use Quickin'
[00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:08.080]   2007 on OS X.
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:09.400]   So they're trying to figure out a way,
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:11.400]   there is a project apparently at Apple
[00:35:11.400 --> 00:35:14.600]   to keep enough of Rosetta around so that you can run Quickin'
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:15.440]   at least for a while.
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:17.640]   - Does Quickin' run well on a Mac?
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:19.880]   'Cause I guess a QuickBooks is useless on the Mac.
[00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:20.720]   - Is it really?
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:21.560]   - Yeah.
[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:22.400]   - That'd be used.
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:23.720]   - I mean, it's just, it's completely useless.
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:25.480]   I mean, it's, and so the thing is, is that you--
[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:27.400]   - I gave up using Quickin' ages, I guess.
[00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:29.200]   - Oh my, well, we use QuickBooks.
[00:35:29.200 --> 00:35:30.360]   - Oh, we use QuickBooks, we use PC.
[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:31.200]   - But it's on PC.
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:32.040]   - But it's on PC.
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:32.880]   - Yeah.
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:33.880]   - 'Cause, and so that's actually the number one reason
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:36.520]   that Carly does using a PC environment
[00:35:36.520 --> 00:35:37.360]   is just to run QuickBooks.
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:40.800]   - Yeah, well, and Lisa uses QuickBooks on Windows,
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:42.200]   but she's using QuickBooks online.
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:44.600]   We use the online version for our business.
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:46.240]   - Yeah, I don't know.
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:48.840]   - Another good tip for people, if they are at all cautious
[00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:51.440]   about using line is to perhaps create a second partition
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:54.160]   and run your current snow leopard,
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:56.360]   and then clone that across to a separate partition
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:58.640]   and update line on that partition and try it for a week,
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:00.520]   and then just switch between the two.
[00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:02.440]   I mean, I'm currently doing that with four petitions
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:03.280]   on my Mac Pro.
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:05.120]   I've got two snow leopard partitions,
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:06.360]   one with the old version of Final Cut,
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:07.640]   and one with the new version of Final Cut,
[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:09.600]   and then two line partitions, again,
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:10.800]   one with the old version of Final Cut,
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.200]   and one with the new version of Final Cut.
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:14.520]   So I'm constantly swapping between four different partitions,
[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:15.600]   which just got a bit confusing,
[00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:16.960]   but at least then you know,
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:18.560]   you've always got a known state you can get back to,
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:20.080]   and it works pretty well.
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:21.120]   - I think that I'll also want,
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:22.040]   anytime you do an update,
[00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:23.240]   this is an opportunity to rethink
[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:25.240]   the way you manage your data.
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:26.960]   You know, and it is really useful.
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.840]   If you've got data all over your computer,
[00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:31.480]   it's to start thinking about a document folder
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:32.440]   that makes it much easier for you
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:34.520]   to move the most important documents around
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:36.960]   and keep things straight.
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:38.520]   I think a lot of us can get pretty lazy
[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:40.040]   and have documents everywhere,
[00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:41.840]   and it really makes a difference
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:44.840]   to have them all in one place
[00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:47.240]   so that you can move them around.
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:48.720]   And then also think about whether you want your media
[00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:50.120]   local on your computer or not.
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:52.400]   These are always, this is always that kind of soul search
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:53.680]   that's possible,
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:58.680]   or best when done connected to a new upgrade.
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:36:59.880]   To think about how you're doing it,
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:00.760]   how it's worked in the past,
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:02.800]   and whether you want to continue going down that path.
[00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:05.120]   - I actually think that once a year,
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:05.960]   once every couple of years,
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:08.520]   it's a really good idea not to do upgrades,
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:10.720]   just to start with a completely empty hard drive,
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:12.360]   and just rebuild everything from scratch.
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:13.200]   - Yes.
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:14.440]   - I do it with every new update.
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:18.960]   - Yeah, I upgrade my computers frequently enough
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:21.120]   that my rule was that I will never transfer information.
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:24.000]   While I will never just clone my old data to the new one,
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.560]   I'll always start brand new with a system folder
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:30.000]   without any foreign system extensions in there.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.160]   With Lion, I'm not sure if I'll do this.
[00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:34.080]   I'm so busy over the next couple of months,
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:37.040]   I probably will not bother to do it that way.
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:40.600]   But if I had a normal life over the summer,
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:42.760]   I would probably try and think of this.
[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:43.960]   And I'm sorry, if not for the fact
[00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:45.800]   that I just bought a brand new MacBook Pro
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:47.080]   like a couple of months ago,
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:48.520]   I would be giving serious consideration
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:49.960]   to making sure that I start fresh.
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:50.800]   You never know.
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:51.920]   There's so many applications
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:53.960]   that will install systems extensions.
[00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:57.600]   And I mean, I'm absolutely baffled whenever I look inside
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:37:59.600]   that folder inside the library to find out, oh.
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:01.640]   - It's nice to start fresh, it really is.
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:04.280]   You know, it's funny, it is on the one hand,
[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:05.560]   very easy to do an update.
[00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:08.120]   Apple really is the best at doing this.
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:10.040]   It really, in place update,
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:13.160]   almost so I've done it many times, goes well.
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:16.360]   On the other hand, Apple, as we get App Store,
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:19.360]   and Dropbox and Cloud soon,
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:22.760]   it's so easy now to start with a completely fresh Mac
[00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:25.000]   and get it up to speed.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.800]   One of the reasons to buy stuff on the App Store
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:29.200]   is you just press the button and say install all of that.
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:32.160]   And then I have my Dropbox, I say connect to the Dropbox.
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:33.720]   My data, I'm done.
[00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:35.720]   So in a way, a fresh install,
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:37.720]   you know, I just got the new i7 iMac,
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:39.440]   the 27 inch iMac that came out.
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:41.800]   It's sitting in the box 'cause it's gonna be for the new studio.
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.800]   And I'm not in a huge hurry because I know
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:46.120]   it's gonna be a trivial thing to just turn it on.
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:48.480]   Turn on Dropbox, actually use something called Walla
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:52.760]   from LaSee, which gives me 400 gigs of cloud storage.
[00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:54.520]   And I'll have everything on it pretty quick.
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:56.760]   - Well, and I think that is my number one reason
[00:38:56.760 --> 00:39:00.000]   that I wanna buy everything on the Mac App Store.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:00.840]   - Totally.
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:02.800]   - It's because knowing that I can get a new computer
[00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:05.160]   or I can, as I do the update,
[00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:06.960]   other than the really high-end professional apps
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:08.720]   that I'm putting on that I know that just aren't gonna move
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:10.600]   to Mac App Store anytime soon.
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:12.000]   Knowing that there's only two or three of those
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.280]   and everything else is just gonna be like install all.
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:15.120]   - Boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:16.480]   - So once I come back to Martin,
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.720]   or come back later in the afternoon and they're all done.
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:20.920]   - Yeah, that's usually the most dramatic thing.
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:22.360]   - I'm getting a lot of emails from people asking,
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:25.240]   will it be possible to do a fresh install from line?
[00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:27.480]   How's it gonna work if you have to have snowed up it on first
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:30.120]   and then you download line from the Mac App Store?
[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:32.000]   How can I then do a fresh install?
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:34.280]   I think it's common knowledge now that there is actually
[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:36.160]   within line this recovery partition
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:37.880]   that's created during the install.
[00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:39.640]   And then from that recovery partition,
[00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:44.360]   you can actually reinstall line to your existing partition.
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:47.400]   So it's in effect, it's like you get a DVD with line,
[00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:49.560]   but it's actually a separate recovery partition
[00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:52.000]   on your Mac. - Oh, that's the one.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.200]   - The worst part of Windows that they're saving,
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:56.880]   it's just terrible.
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:57.960]   There is-- - There's something--
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.520]   - In the developer version,
[00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:01.760]   and I presume that this will be the case in the Gold Master,
[00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:03.680]   I would love to know if somebody has the Gold Master
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:04.680]   if they would check.
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:06.640]   You can do show package contents,
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:10.000]   and there is in fact a file, a DMG file in there,
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.520]   that is the install disk that you could pull off,
[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:13.720]   put it on a thumb drive.
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:15.520]   Now my question is, could I then install it
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:20.000]   on a blank system or a leopard system directly?
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.160]   - Once you have that. - Once I have that file.
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:25.920]   I'm gonna be very curious, have you played with that at all done?
[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:29.000]   - I've heard it can be done, but as a developer,
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.720]   possibly condone the opening up of Apple packages,
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:35.720]   but it does work on a thumb drive I've heard.
[00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:39.040]   - Yeah, so the details are pretty straightforward,
[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:40.440]   I don't have the exact name of the file,
[00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:42.520]   but it's actually fairly easy to find.
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:46.600]   I think it says install a lion, something like that.
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:50.600]   So all you do is you open show package contents,
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:52.880]   go in there and there's a DMG file,
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:55.320]   it'll be fairly large I would guess.
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:58.200]   And so find the biggest DMG file in the package
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:40:59.680]   and then copy that to it.
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:00.680]   - It's fairly easy to Google,
[00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:02.720]   there's a couple of people who documented it on the web,
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:06.320]   so you basically use the restore,
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:08.360]   within disk utility you can use restore to restore
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:11.200]   the disk image that you find in that package to a thumb drive,
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:13.680]   and you end up with a bootable thumb drive.
[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:14.960]   - It's actually apparently the image
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:16.520]   that they put on a recoverable partition,
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:17.960]   and a number of people in our chat rooms
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:20.360]   say they have the gold master, the developers,
[00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:25.160]   and they say you can do that with the gold master.
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:28.120]   You can open it in disk utility, burn a DVD,
[00:41:28.120 --> 00:41:30.160]   I presume you can copy it to a thumb drive,
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:32.320]   so that's really good news, that means,
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:34.080]   well first of all, that's gonna save the internet
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:36.600]   some bandwidth, because if you've got a copy of it,
[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:38.520]   - Right, you know it downloaded every single time.
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:40.520]   - I'm gonna go around all the machines here
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:43.600]   and install them all from the single thumb drive,
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:45.240]   so I think that's the way to do it,
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:50.240]   or an external hard drive, or even, I guess,
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:53.000]   DVD if you wanted to burn one.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.440]   I think that would be a smart thing to do,
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:57.240]   I would add that to my list of things to do,
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:42:00.720]   is to make a DVD copy of Lion, so you have it lying around.
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:01.680]   Don't you think?
[00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:03.320]   - Yes, yeah, you definitely want to--
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:04.320]   - I don't trust it, this is what's,
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:06.760]   they do this on the PCs too, where you have an install
[00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:08.560]   partition with the operating system, I don't trust it.
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:10.600]   - I mean, I really wanted on external drives,
[00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:11.440]   - Yes.
[00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:14.280]   - from a network, the DVD is not as important,
[00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:15.120]   because I think the--
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:16.880]   - Some external media, let's put it that way.
[00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:18.080]   - I think that kind of, these are the last machines
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:18.920]   that I've got in the fire.
[00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:21.080]   - So actually, I put it on a USB.
[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:23.680]   - This is a 16 gigabyte USB key,
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:25.280]   I'll just put this around my neck and I'll go,
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:27.520]   "Anybody that's lying, got your lion,
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:29.760]   get your hot fresh lion here."
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:31.440]   - That's one thing that I'm starting to do some research
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:33.560]   on is like, Lion, Xt, USB keys.
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:34.760]   - Huh?
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:36.120]   Sorry, Andy?
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:36.960]   Go ahead.
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:38.840]   - Sorry, I thought I was interrupting Alex.
[00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:40.440]   - You are and I'm glad that you do it.
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:41.280]   - He was glad to go right ahead.
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:43.600]   - I was gonna say something completely useless.
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:44.680]   As I often do.
[00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:47.080]   - You have the gold master, don't you, Andy?
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:49.760]   - Of, if I were a developer and had the gold master,
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:51.160]   I probably wouldn't be able to say that,
[00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:52.000]   'cause that would be--
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.960]   - Oh, that's right, it wouldn't be allowed.
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:55.920]   - But all I was gonna say is that the one,
[00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:58.360]   conceptually, the only thing that terrifies me about Lion
[00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:02.040]   is this idea of the default way of getting it
[00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:04.040]   is going to be to download it from somewhere,
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:06.200]   because it is going to be so super important
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:07.880]   to have that USB thumb drive
[00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:10.240]   or have that burned DVD somewhere,
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:11.800]   because when, think about it,
[00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:14.560]   when you have to reinstall the OS,
[00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:16.440]   you're usually not doing it because you're bored.
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:19.360]   It's because you're in one of those worst case scenarios.
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:23.920]   And I would just hate to trust that I'm in a situation
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:26.400]   which I have to trust that the second partition is working
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:29.560]   or I have to trust that I can somehow get this working
[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:33.000]   enough that I can get onto the Wi-Fi or--
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:33.840]   - Right.
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:36.080]   - It might just be that I've been installing
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:38.040]   systems the old fashioned way for so long,
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:40.120]   but there's something about, look, I have a thing
[00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:43.840]   about this thing here is going to solve my problem for me.
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:46.200]   If I have this, I'm okay.
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:48.720]   If I have the promise that I have a sort of a
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:51.040]   ethereal Martha Graham dance version
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:54.840]   and perverted dance, I'm gonna say, okay, I'll trust you,
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:56.480]   but I really need to have this working.
[00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:58.320]   I have to give a presentation in three hours.
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:00.880]   - Yeah, no, in fact, this is gonna be it.
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:04.160]   I might as well put a little icon, a lion icon on this.
[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:05.440]   That's gonna be the lion.
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:07.840]   I love actually having that little, it's a little too small,
[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:11.200]   but that little USB key with the air that comes with the air
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:12.240]   with the operating system on it.
[00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:15.520]   It's just kind of a nice feeling to have that just around.
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:16.600]   - Yes.
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:20.760]   - And all the Macs still have USB anyway for the time being.
[00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:23.640]   More rumors to come and we're gonna play a little game
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:24.480]   with Andy.
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:26.520]   What, what--
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:27.680]   (laughing)
[00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:29.560]   I always like playing this game with Andy.
[00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:32.400]   What pre-release products do you have today
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.400]   that you won't talk about, but we'll do that in a moment.
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:35.640]   First time I want to talk.
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:37.240]   - Here boy, here boy, come on.
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:38.960]   - Yeah, get the dog, you might as well get the dog Andy.
[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:41.640]   It's your time.
[00:44:41.640 --> 00:44:43.320]   I do want to tell you about FreshBooks.
[00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:47.040]   Yes, the cake people, they become famous for this deal
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:50.120]   they do with the birthday cake.
[00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:50.960]   I love it.
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:53.280]   FreshBooks, let me tell you about FreshBooks.com.
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:55.800]   If you do invoices, and I know many of you do,
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:45:00.120]   many of you are freelancers, I, for years, didn't get paid
[00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:02.520]   unless I invoiced my customers,
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:05.000]   but there was always a thing I hated.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.080]   You know, I'd fire up the word processor,
[00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:10.320]   the spreadsheet and then make the invoice on a printed,
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:13.240]   stamp it, mail it, and wait weeks to get paid.
[00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:15.080]   And I would never was sure if I'd sent the invoice,
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:16.400]   I could never remember.
[00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:17.240]   It was just a pain.
[00:45:17.240 --> 00:45:20.160]   The Namber McArthur showed me this in 2004,
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:21.640]   FreshBooks.com.
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:23.680]   She was showing it to me 'cause they have such a great website
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:27.480]   but I said, "Whoa, I think I can use this."
[00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:30.360]   And I immediately created an invoice on FreshBooks
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:32.160]   with my little logo on there,
[00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:34.480]   and started emailing my invoices.
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:37.080]   And man, what a transformation.
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:39.120]   What a transformation that was.
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:41.360]   All of a sudden, I'm not only,
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:42.880]   it's it easy for me to do invoices.
[00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:45.800]   I know exactly who I've invoiced exactly when.
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:49.320]   I can automate the dings when people don't pay me
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:51.240]   within 30, 60 or 90 days,
[00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:53.680]   but I even got paid faster because the email
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:56.320]   has a pay Leo button in it.
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:58.120]   Right now, they can credit card it
[00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:01.680]   or they can use one of 11 popular online payment services
[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:04.400]   like Paypal and Authorize.net.
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:07.280]   So it's really straightforward to get paid.
[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:09.520]   There's jobs that I still haven't been paid for.
[00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:10.360]   Yeah.
[00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:11.200]   10 years later 'cause like.
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:12.280]   'Cause you never invoiced it probably.
[00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:13.120]   I didn't make the invoice.
[00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:14.360]   Yeah, I know, I know the feeling.
[00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:15.760]   I probably have some of those.
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:18.480]   I love this follow up so you know exactly
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:19.720]   when your clients not only pay,
[00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:22.640]   but you could tell when they've read the invoice.
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:24.920]   You could tell, let me say that again.
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:27.120]   You could tell when they've read the invoice.
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:29.240]   So there's no like, "Oh, we didn't get it."
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:30.120]   Right.
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:31.400]   You know when they saw it.
[00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:34.760]   I just, I mean, I can go on and on and on.
[00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:36.800]   The invoices are very professional looking.
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:38.760]   It's, as they say,
[00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:41.360]   Fortrait 500 style billing.
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:42.320]   If there are clients,
[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:43.880]   and there still are some old timey clients
[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:44.840]   who want to print an invoice,
[00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:46.400]   they'll do that too for an additional fee.
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:48.520]   And it's all just very straightforward.
[00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:51.680]   If you do time in hours, great for that or expenses.
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:54.240]   They have an iPhone app or a web app that'll do this
[00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:56.480]   and automatically, boom, boom.
[00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:58.920]   Put it right, I'm gonna find the right sound for that.
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:00.520]   Put it right into the invoice.
[00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:02.240]   (clicking)
[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:04.560]   - We have more noise and don't get picked up or invoice.
[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:06.640]   (laughing)
[00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:07.480]   - That's awesome.
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:08.920]   (clicking)
[00:47:08.920 --> 00:47:11.520]   - A little Christmas card for you over 55 is up there.
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:12.360]   - Yeah.
[00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:14.520]   (laughing)
[00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:16.080]   - They'll put it right into the invoice there.
[00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:18.160]   And it's just fantastic.
[00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:20.160]   And now here's another nice feature.
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:21.400]   You can do recurring invoices,
[00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:22.560]   so you don't even have to make the invoice
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:23.720]   'cause if it's the same amount every month,
[00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:25.560]   you just do, which it was for me with Rogers,
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:27.360]   I could have just had this done automatically.
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:30.120]   And even recurring payments if they agree to it.
[00:47:30.120 --> 00:47:32.120]   I love that.
[00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:33.520]   I love that.
[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:35.280]   Just automatic.
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:37.200]   Any currency, if you work internationally,
[00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:39.120]   I did and that was a great feature too.
[00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:41.080]   I want you to try FreshBooks right now.
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:43.760]   Go to freshbooks.com.
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:45.040]   - Leo, there's only one way
[00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:46.280]   that you're gonna get me to try it.
[00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:47.120]   - What's that?
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:47.960]   - I need a chance.
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:49.800]   Just a chance to win a cake.
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:51.440]   (laughing)
[00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:54.000]   - Well, let me tell you, it's free for the first three clients.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.600]   Once you try it easily, you can go to up to,
[00:47:55.600 --> 00:47:57.960]   you can go to 25 clients for 20 bucks a month.
[00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:00.360]   It'll only take you a minute and yes.
[00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:01.880]   And yes.
[00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:04.640]   Everybody who signs up for that free account right now
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:07.360]   is in a drawing for the weekly birthday cake giveaway.
[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:08.200]   - I've had one.
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:10.440]   - You don't have to have a birthday to win the cake.
[00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:12.160]   I shouldn't have to tell you that.
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:14.320]   It's your birthday every day of the year with FreshBooks.
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:15.560]   - Does it come with a song?
[00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:16.400]   - No.
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:18.600]   Because America, the "Align Time Warner" would ding us
[00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:20.760]   if we sang the song.
[00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:23.560]   To win the birthday cake, make sure you mention
[00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:24.560]   that you heard it on Mac Break
[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:27.960]   because we don't want to make sure that you get that drawing.
[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:29.600]   I'm just a big fan.
[00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:30.440]   I know you will be too.
[00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:32.120]   FreshBooks.
[00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:33.480]   - Yeah, I use it the other way round though.
[00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:35.400]   I'm the receiver of FreshBooks and Voices.
[00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:36.400]   - Are you?
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:37.520]   - Yeah, well, have a group of guys
[00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:38.640]   who help me out with the editing now.
[00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:40.240]   I'm trying to work a bit smarter these days.
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:43.920]   So when I do the show, I actually give it to a number of people
[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:45.760]   who are helping me out doing the assembly edits.
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:47.760]   So they then charge me on a monthly basis
[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:49.640]   and I've got them to send me FreshBooks and Voices.
[00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:50.840]   And the nice thing is, as soon as it comes in,
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:53.400]   I can just pay it straight away if they've got a PayPal link in there.
[00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:54.960]   And I don't have to file it away.
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:56.200]   I could just do when it's in the inbox.
[00:48:56.200 --> 00:48:58.680]   If I do want to leave it to the next day to pay,
[00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:00.040]   I'll just file it away in the email,
[00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:02.760]   go back to the email, click on the button and it's paid.
[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:04.720]   It just makes it like easy for me.
[00:49:04.720 --> 00:49:05.560]   - There you hear it.
[00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:08.640]   An unsolicited endorsement from the man.
[00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:11.440]   The guy you're asking for money from,
[00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:13.800]   it's easier for them too.
[00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:16.360]   Everybody loves FreshBooks, freshbooks.com.
[00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:19.440]   Thank you for that unsolicited endorsement, Don.
[00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:20.280]   That's great.
[00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:21.120]   - That's okay.
[00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:25.360]   Andy, do you have, actually, there's nothing to hide here, Andy.
[00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:28.040]   You could say you have the HP touchpad.
[00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:29.480]   Do you have that?
[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:30.760]   - I do not have that.
[00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:32.760]   That maybe a little bit,
[00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:36.200]   there's, I found that a little bit odd
[00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:38.640]   because HP kind of went from,
[00:49:38.640 --> 00:49:42.320]   the HP kind of went from saying,
[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:44.160]   oh yes, absolutely no, we'll get you one
[00:49:44.160 --> 00:49:46.320]   to like shortly before the lot saying,
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:49.040]   yeah, we're kind of, we don't have many of those left.
[00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:50.800]   So we'll definitely, you're definitely on the list.
[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:52.520]   We'll get it to you.
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:54.080]   - That's just, that's a bad sign usually
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:56.640]   when a company doesn't rush to get you a product for review.
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:49:58.000]   And I have to say, the early reviews
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.360]   are a little disappointing.
[00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:00.680]   - And that not necessarily bad could be
[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:04.040]   that they just have fewer available than they thought.
[00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:08.040]   And again, people who have an absolute rock solid
[00:50:08.040 --> 00:50:11.080]   international readership will definitely get priority.
[00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:11.920]   - Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:14.240]   So they're going after that international crowd.
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:15.280]   Well, they're already spinning.
[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:18.160]   You know, the touchpad came out last week.
[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:20.120]   It's a Thursday last week and HP executive said,
[00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:22.240]   well, wait a minute, we're not trying to take away.
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:23.760]   It sales from the iPad.
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:25.040]   - Of course we wouldn't.
[00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:27.520]   We wouldn't, we're aiming at the enterprise,
[00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:28.680]   which is interestingly enough,
[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:30.560]   exactly where BlackBerry aimed their failed.
[00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:33.120]   And I think it's safe to say failed playbook.
[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:34.440]   - Well, you know, the thing that I think is important
[00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:36.040]   is to realize that the iPad is not being used
[00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:37.160]   in the enterprise at all.
[00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:39.840]   So it's leaving a wide open target for anybody.
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:40.960]   No, I'm just being suspicious.
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:41.800]   - That's not true.
[00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:43.560]   - I know, it's not true at all.
[00:50:43.560 --> 00:50:45.960]   - It's everywhere you go, UC iPads.
[00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:47.960]   If there's, they're multiplying like,
[00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:48.800]   - I was in executive meeting,
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:50.520]   there were 300 people in the room
[00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:52.520]   and the person at front said,
[00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:53.840]   how many people here have iPads
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:56.120]   and almost everybody raised their hand?
[00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:58.880]   - Executives love, the iPad is exactly for executives.
[00:50:58.880 --> 00:50:59.720]   That's what they want.
[00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:01.920]   They don't, first of all, many executives still,
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:03.960]   hard to believe, can't type.
[00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:04.800]   - Yeah.
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:06.840]   - They have a girl to do that, they say.
[00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:08.840]   - My girl, I'll type it up for you.
[00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:10.040]   - And so this is perfect,
[00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:11.040]   'cause really what they,
[00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:12.480]   now I think this is more old school now.
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:14.680]   Modern executive, of course, is computer literate.
[00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:16.160]   It can type and does all that stuff.
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:19.400]   But, you know, the executives, my age and older,
[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:20.960]   I think a lot of them don't type
[00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:22.400]   and all they want is a dashboard
[00:51:22.400 --> 00:51:25.400]   and what better device for making a dashboard
[00:51:25.400 --> 00:51:26.280]   for an executive.
[00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:28.200]   However, I like WebOS,
[00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:30.640]   I would love to see the touchpad succeed.
[00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:33.040]   It's exactly the same price as Apple.
[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:35.520]   Not as many apps, just a few hundred apps.
[00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:38.600]   But the reviews have been very,
[00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:42.280]   relatively negative, they say it's sluggish.
[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:43.320]   - They're very consistent though, haven't they?
[00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:45.000]   - They've been very consistent.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:46.400]   Most people really dig,
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:48.200]   well, it sounds as though it's actually been
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:50.640]   sort of designed against the original iPad 1.
[00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:51.880]   And that sort of strikes me as though
[00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:53.160]   they weren't agile enough to actually
[00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:55.440]   redo the design when iPad 2 came out.
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:56.720]   So it's sort of like, you know,
[00:51:56.720 --> 00:51:57.920]   it's on the wrong foot to begin with
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:51:59.520]   'cause it's slightly heavier and slightly bulkier
[00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:00.720]   and a bit thicker, although it is the
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:03.520]   four by three screen aspect ratio.
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:05.200]   But then it's the software, you know, it's all this again.
[00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:07.000]   It's not really about the hardware, it's the software
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.600]   and people across the board have found it
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:11.320]   to be sluggish and buggy and not really what,
[00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:13.360]   I think we were led to expect as this being,
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:15.360]   because they did take the time bringing it to market.
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:18.160]   I really did think it would be a credible iPad alternative
[00:52:18.160 --> 00:52:21.200]   but they seem to have dropped the ball at launch.
[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:23.400]   Now they do say they've got some OTI updates
[00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:26.080]   coming along very, very soon that will fix most of the bugs.
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:29.240]   But now why release it and get all this bad press
[00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:32.400]   and negative reviews if the thing's not ready?
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:33.840]   - Yeah, crazy.
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:35.680]   - Furthermore, I think HP's stung a little bit
[00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:40.160]   by the fact that Apple's now eclipsed it even in PC sales.
[00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:43.640]   And you saw the stat that it takes HP seven computers,
[00:52:43.640 --> 00:52:46.440]   they have to sell seven units to make the same amount
[00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:49.080]   of money Apple makes them one computer.
[00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:51.880]   So all in all, HP's got to be, you know.
[00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:55.160]   - Well, they're having a minor success with VIR,
[00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:56.000]   surprisingly enough.
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.400]   So they finally have a web OS device off the door
[00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:00.600]   that a lot of people really, really like.
[00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:03.160]   So that's kind of what made me surprised
[00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:06.960]   that the pad was getting such poor reviews.
[00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:08.520]   I really thought that it would scale up nicely
[00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:10.640]   or else like on said that they would make sure
[00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:13.640]   that the people's first look at it
[00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:16.680]   is of a device that really is working fine.
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:20.360]   I do think though that I'm not willing to let any company
[00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:23.320]   completely off the hook if they're actually expecting people
[00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:24.880]   to pay money for these things.
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:27.080]   They're taking money for these devices.
[00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:29.920]   They have to be reviewed really as confidence
[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:31.800]   and as reliably as you can.
[00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:34.400]   I do think though that this still is a rebuilding
[00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:37.040]   near for everybody and that it's sort of like,
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:39.040]   it's sort of like reviewing like the third sequel
[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:41.440]   to the police academy or like,
[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:43.560]   or not a sequel to the Scooby Doo movie.
[00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:46.080]   You have to start off with the acknowledgement that,
[00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:49.200]   okay, let's just confirm that this is kind of sucky.
[00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:51.720]   It doesn't really work well and nobody should go out
[00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:53.080]   and buy one of these things.
[00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:56.280]   However, let's now take a look at if they've got enough,
[00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:59.720]   great enough molecular okayness inside this thing
[00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:00.800]   that they can actually go ahead
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:03.000]   and try to do another one next year.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.560]   - Do you think that one of the problems is
[00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:06.280]   that you don't want to not do anything
[00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:08.320]   and have Apple just keep on running down the path
[00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:10.920]   but you know that, so that they want to put something out
[00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:12.760]   but none of these things are really hitting the mark
[00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:13.920]   and I think the question is,
[00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:15.280]   does it do more damage to be quiet
[00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:17.200]   or does it do more damage to misfire?
[00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:19.560]   And I think everyone's making those choices
[00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:20.840]   over and over and over again all summer
[00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:22.360]   is that nobody really has a solution
[00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:24.640]   that is competing with the iPad yet.
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:26.760]   And so some of them are deciding,
[00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:27.800]   well we're gonna put something out there
[00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:29.120]   so people know that we still exist
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:31.400]   and they're not just all buying iPads
[00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:32.600]   but the question is,
[00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:33.920]   are they just gonna keep on underlying
[00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:35.640]   that they don't know what they're in?
[00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:36.920]   - I'd also really like to know
[00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:40.800]   with how the business works that way.
[00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:44.000]   It's not as though they decide in May
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:47.160]   how many parts they're going to order and buy
[00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:49.480]   to ship a device in June or July.
[00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:50.760]   They have all this inventory,
[00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:52.880]   they have all this hardware, they have all this product.
[00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:54.560]   If they're gonna take a loss on it
[00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:55.600]   and get a write off for it,
[00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:57.200]   they really have to release it.
[00:54:57.200 --> 00:54:59.040]   I think that that's kind of,
[00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:01.960]   I think that's kind of one of the reasons why we're seeing
[00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:04.800]   so many obvious misfires being released this year
[00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:07.000]   because last year they made these plans,
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.040]   they came up with a design,
[00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:10.560]   they thought that it was going to be like a PC
[00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:12.560]   where all you have to do is design a box,
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:14.960]   put a mouse on it or a tripod
[00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:16.960]   and make sure it has the form and the shape
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:18.440]   of this thing you're trying to compete with.
[00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:20.160]   It'll be at least 75% of the way.
[00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:22.240]   But it turns out that there is a great deal
[00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:24.280]   of secret sauce involved in the iPad
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:25.920]   and a great deal of infrastructure
[00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:28.880]   that has to be in place in order to give the user
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:30.360]   that kind of compelling experience.
[00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:32.200]   So I really think that the whole point
[00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:34.480]   of releasing the touchpad is to make sure
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:36.080]   they can get those write offs
[00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:37.440]   and maybe could link,
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:38.840]   limp back, take the lessons
[00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:41.760]   and come up with something better for 2012.
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:44.080]   >> Well, I like WebOS, I would like to see a success,
[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:47.520]   but I think Apple owns the market this year,
[00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:48.680]   as you've said many times.
[00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:49.520]   >> This year.
[00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:52.320]   >> Hey, June 29th was a nice birthday,
[00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:54.280]   it was the fourth anniversary of the iPhone,
[00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:56.720]   nice little infographic from the cult
[00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:59.440]   of Mac happy anniversary iPhone.
[00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:03.040]   With a timeline in here, June 29th, 2007,
[00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:06.160]   Apple releases the first iPhone in the US.
[00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:10.640]   November 9th, the UK, November 29th, France,
[00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:16.240]   the 16 gigabyte version came out February 2008,
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:22.240]   July 2008, July 14th, 800 apps.
[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:24.120]   It's kind of funny to hear that number.
[00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:28.320]   800 apps in the app store and a 10 million app downloads.
[00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:31.160]   The 3G came out June of 2008.
[00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:36.760]   iPhone 3G was the first to work with the 3G network,
[00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:40.160]   a lot of people forget that the first iPhone was edge only.
[00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:43.600]   Apple renamed the operating system iPhone OS,
[00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:46.520]   or iOS on March 8th, 2008,
[00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:49.120]   and March, April 23rd, 2009.
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:53.520]   35,000 iPhone apps in the app store.
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:56:57.080]   One billion app downloads.
[00:56:57.080 --> 00:57:01.600]   The 3GS came out on June 19th, 29.
[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:06.040]   The iPhone 4 on sale, June 24th, 2010,
[00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:11.640]   and announced for a rise in January 11th, 2011.
[00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:13.640]   So that's where we stand right now.
[00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:17.200]   On the fourth year of the iPhone era,
[00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:19.680]   it's been a good era, actually.
[00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:25.000]   Just a quick rundown of pricing, 599 for the original iPhone.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:26.440]   I have a change price.
[00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:29.520]   I have like 499 for the 8 gigabyte.
[00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:31.440]   And I'm sorry, 599 for the 8 gigabyte,
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:34.360]   499 for the 4 gigabyte.
[00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:41.160]   As of June 6, 2011, 14 billion downloads.
[00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:44.120]   Half a million apps, the 500,000th app.
[00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:50.800]   500,000th app was approved in May.
[00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:56.200]   500,000 apps, it's kind of hard to believe.
[00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:58.080]   37% of them are free.
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:01.600]   The average price, $3.64.
[00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:07.400]   Apple accounts for 9 out of 10 downloads in 2010.
[00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:08.960]   I didn't call it a measure success.
[00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:11.200]   There's a certain--
[00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:14.560]   In 2010, the app store generated 1.8 billion in revenue.
[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:16.960]   So if Apple gets 30% of that, you can do the math.
[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:20.320]   It's not a bad business.
[00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:22.160]   So this is kind of fun to go through.
[00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:26.800]   This market cap for Apple today, $306 billion.
[00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:31.600]   When the iPhone came out, it was less than half, $122 billion.
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:34.520]   So that's kind of interesting.
[00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:37.240]   And the Apple stock, when the iPhone came out,
[00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:40.640]   was down below $122.
[00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:42.480]   Now at over $300.
[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:45.200]   So the iPhone has certainly been a big--
[00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:46.800]   Actually, this is not called to Mac Mashable
[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:47.480]   did these graphics.
[00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:49.080]   Let's give credit where credits do.
[00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:52.160]   Christina Warren did a man named Lee Cuffield did the design.
[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:55.920]   So that's a fun infographic that just shows you
[00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:57.760]   how far we've come in four years.
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:59:00.720]   It also shows you that if Apple really wanted to go
[00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:03.640]   widescreen, they could do a VISTA vision aspect ratio
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:04.560]   iPhone.
[00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:07.400]   And it would actually be pretty interesting.
[00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:10.040]   I don't know what you-- I don't get it.
[00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:12.680]   VISTA vision, the ultra-like widescreen format.
[00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:13.600]   Yeah, you think?
[00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:14.880]   It doesn't matter.
[00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:16.840]   Isn't it like that graphic is like a--
[00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:17.800]   It was a fat graph.
[00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:20.000]   Oh, for those of you who are not going for a humorous thing,
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:21.120]   you probably aimed and missed.
[00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:22.160]   I'm sorry.
[00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:25.240]   No, I'm just-- I'm slow.
[00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:27.400]   Please forgive me.
[00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:29.800]   Samsung dropped one of the counter suits.
[00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:33.440]   But according to Neeliah Patel, who was in our Twitch show
[00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:36.000]   this Sunday, who was a lawyer, he said,
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:38.720]   that's just one of many that lawsuits go on.
[00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:42.200]   In fact, Apple's asked for an injunction against Samsung
[00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:46.320]   to prevent Samsung from selling phones or tablets in the US.
[00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:47.640]   A handful of them.
[00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:49.280]   The-- well, for--
[00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:53.360]   Yeah, but the ones that look exactly like the iPhone.
[00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:55.520]   The ones they're selling, yes.
[00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:58.960]   I'm planning to get a 2S, the Galaxy 2S.
[00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:00.320]   Yeah, it's got great.
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:02.960]   He's waiting for Verizon to Nexus or Galaxy 2S.
[01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:03.840]   Yeah.
[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:05.240]   It's getting great to refuse.
[01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:05.720]   Yes.
[01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:07.440]   I feel like you're going to-- you're going to move to Android.
[01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:08.640]   I'm not going to move to Android.
[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:09.800]   I'm just going to add Android.
[01:00:09.800 --> 01:00:10.760]   I need-- I want a 4G phone.
[01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:11.440]   Should have both.
[01:00:11.440 --> 01:00:12.280]   I want a 4G phone.
[01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:13.560]   I want to be able to compare them.
[01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:16.720]   And we're working on some podcasts that I need.
[01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:20.520]   I wonder how many people buy Android phones
[01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:22.600]   because they want 4G.
[01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:24.800]   Does that have a significant market?
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:26.920]   I want to have a 4G something.
[01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:29.200]   And I was like looking at, do I get a MyFi 4G?
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:30.480]   Or do I just get a phone?
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:33.240]   And I decided to just go ahead and get a phone.
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:33.760]   Apple--
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:36.000]   By the way, we spent a little bit of money--
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:38.560]   $4 and 1/2 billion in conjunction
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:41.600]   with some other companies to buy the Nortell Patton--
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:46.680]   6,000 Nortell phone patents, keeping them away from Google.
[01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:51.320]   Google's highest bid was $3.14159 billion.
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:52.840]   Sound familiar?
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:55.480]   $3.14159 billion.
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:56.720]   They had prime interest.
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:57.240]   Yeah.
[01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:00.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:02.680]   Now, some people say that Apple will use these to sue.
[01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:04.400]   Of course, it could just be purely defensive.
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:06.560]   A lot of times you have patents just to defend against Google.
[01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:07.720]   It'd be interesting if Apple--
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:09.200]   Apple has gone after-- as you--
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:11.360]   you know, Samsung devices and other Android devices.
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:12.960]   Do you think they'll go after Google?
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:14.400]   Well, I think they won't do because given
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:17.960]   that Google was really after the whole pie, you know?
[01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:20.360]   I think Apple wanted to make sure they had a piece of it,
[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:21.640]   more than a piece of it.
[01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:23.960]   Sorry, I have to obsess with the 3.14.
[01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:26.040]   Oh, well, it was not amused at all.
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:26.880]   You were just like really--
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:27.720]   It does teach us there.
[01:01:27.720 --> 01:01:30.600]   I asked you a serious question.
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:32.360]   So the-- go ahead, Andy.
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:33.000]   Go ahead, Andy.
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.440]   Oh, no, I was just going to say it does show us that Google does not
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:40.840]   have 6.02 times 10 to the $23, because that would have been their next bid.
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:41.560]   Yeah.
[01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:45.760]   No, I think all three bids were a mathematical constant.
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:49.400]   Well, when you see all of these arguments,
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:51.040]   I mean, all the lawsuits that are--
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:52.840]   you can see why these patents are so important.
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:54.560]   Always the lawsuit is getting slung between--
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:55.200]   No, Kia.
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:58.240]   --and Sam's song.
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:01.280]   And Google, I think that Apple definitely wants to make sure--
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:03.440]   I think it's more of a defensive than an offensive thing.
[01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:05.240]   It just makes you sure that they can do those things.
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:06.840]   I don't think they need to sue anybody for it.
[01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:08.720]   But I think that they do-- for these kind of patents,
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:09.400]   I think they just want to make sure
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:11.960]   they don't end up on the wrong end of the lawsuit.
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:14.880]   Apple also got kind of dinged in a lot of the blogs and message
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:17.880]   sports for getting a patent for essentially every smart phone,
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:20.560]   every multi-touch smartphone that could ever be invented.
[01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:22.800]   But it doesn't really doesn't look like the--
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:25.200]   like you say, Alex, it looks like a defensive patent
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:26.800]   and not an offensive one.
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:30.160]   It's silly that such a simple bra patent could be actually issued.
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:33.320]   But I don't feel so that's the dangerous thing to have out in the field,
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:35.880]   or at least not dangerous in Apple's hands.
[01:02:35.880 --> 01:02:41.680]   Last story, and then we'll get to your picks of the week, Skype 5.2 comes out.
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:46.280]   Skype will not give up until they get the Mac version working.
[01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:49.640]   This one now adds, interestingly, group screen sharing.
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:53.160]   This, I think, might be a response to Google Hangout,
[01:02:53.160 --> 01:02:55.880]   part of their Google+ launch.
[01:02:55.880 --> 01:03:00.680]   There's no screen sharing there, but you have multiple user groups
[01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:02.360]   in the Google Hangout.
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:05.560]   Skype for Mac has had that multi-user capability,
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:06.640]   but not screen sharing now.
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:07.800]   They do.
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:10.280]   Which makes us kind of an interesting product.
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:12.920]   How many total can you share your screen with?
[01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:14.680]   Skype, was it five?
[01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:16.080]   I don't know.
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:18.720]   It's not 10, which is what Google+ lets you do.
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:21.360]   Google+ is an interesting product because--
[01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:22.040]   I haven't done that yet.
[01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:26.040]   So you can screen share up to 10 people in the Hangouts?
[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:27.480]   No, Hangout has no screen sharing.
[01:03:27.480 --> 01:03:31.040]   That's my point is that this is to one up Hangout.
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:36.200]   We will be covering, by the way, tomorrow at 10 a.m.
[01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:37.160]   tomorrow.
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:39.520]   We'll be covering the Facebook announcement.
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:40.120]   It's expected.
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:43.040]   The Facebook will announce something like Hangout using Skype.
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:45.160]   So this might be part of that.
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:47.600]   Hangout, for those who don't yet have Google+-- which I know
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:49.120]   as most of you--
[01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:53.720]   allows you to have a video chat with a group of 10 total,
[01:03:53.720 --> 01:03:55.760]   you and nine other people.
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:56.760]   I've done quite a few of them.
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:58.080]   And it works quite well.
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:03:59.920]   What's interesting is people like Michael Dell
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:01.000]   can't stop doing it.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.040]   Michael Dell of Dell computers, he doesn't
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:05.480]   hang out like every day with strangers.
[01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:09.160]   Many of the Google senior staff also is doing that.
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:10.600]   It's kind of interesting.
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:14.160]   It's like chat roulette only with ID validation beforehand.
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:17.120]   Yeah, it's more like nerd roulette.
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:18.040]   It is interesting.
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:20.120]   I think that they only complain a hat about it
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:22.920]   is that whoever has the loudest and oldest keyboard
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:26.400]   generally will get the automatic camera switch.
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:27.400]   Yeah.
[01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:29.680]   Whereas the loudest audio gets switched too.
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:33.880]   I think we have to make some standards for how this is done.
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:36.920]   And one thing is mute yourself unless you have something
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:37.800]   to say things like that.
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:41.000]   But if you're the leader, you can mute everybody.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000]   It's really interesting.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.680]   And I can't wait to see what Facebook doesn't
[01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:46.000]   respond tomorrow.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.040]   I have to say, I don't completely understand Google+ yet,
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:48.760]   but I do find it.
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:49.920]   You know who's the number one user?
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:51.320]   Most followed user?
[01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:53.320]   Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:54.360]   That's just silly.
[01:04:54.360 --> 01:04:55.440]   He doesn't post, though.
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:57.280]   So it doesn't really-- it shouldn't really count.
[01:04:57.280 --> 01:05:00.120]   If he posted a lot-- you know who does post a lot, the guy
[01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:03.160]   who founded MySpace, Tom Anderson.
[01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:03.600]   Oh, really?
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:05.360]   He's very active on Google+.
[01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:07.440]   He's got a lot of time on his hands these days.
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:08.200]   Ouch.
[01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:10.080]   Ouch.
[01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:10.360]   All right.
[01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:12.160]   Who the most followed woman is?
[01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:14.000]   Ms. Gina Tarpani.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000]   There you go.
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:15.920]   Very proud of that.
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:21.000]   We don't-- I don't want to spend a lot of time talking
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:21.640]   about Google+.
[01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:22.960]   If you want to hear more about Google+,
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:24.680]   we spent a lot of time talking about it on this week
[01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:27.400]   or the last Wednesday when it launched.
[01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:30.160]   In fact, we had interviews with the two guys leading the project,
[01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:32.160]   Vikkundotra and Bradley Horowitz,
[01:05:32.160 --> 01:05:35.720]   but we also on Twitter on Sunday spent a lot of time
[01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:36.440]   for Scoble join us.
[01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:37.880]   We talked a lot about Google+.
[01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:41.360]   He's a very active Google+ proponent.
[01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:43.760]   You know who's also on Google+?
[01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:45.880]   Newt Gingrich.
[01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:48.400]   My team and I are considering how to best use Hangouts.
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:50.440]   We believe because they're limited to 10 people
[01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:52.720]   that the topic should be very narrow.
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:54.280]   So it's to attract people to care specifically
[01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:55.280]   about these issues.
[01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:58.440]   I think if Hangouts becomes a big part of the 2012 campaign,
[01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:00.200]   that'll be interesting.
[01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:02.000]   Well, it's not a surprise.
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.960]   Given that it's a free service, it's definitely
[01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:07.400]   within Newt Gingrich's fundraising price range.
[01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:08.920]   Listen, though, I got to say--
[01:06:08.920 --> 01:06:11.160]   And with a maximum of 10 people per chat,
[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:13.280]   I think he's also got his voting target.
[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:15.720]   Yeah, all of his bases is allowed in.
[01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:17.560]   No, but listen to the topics that he wants to--
[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:18.840]   he says, please let me know if you're interested
[01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:20.240]   in any of the following topics.
[01:06:20.240 --> 01:06:24.520]   Privatizing NASA, NIH reform, repealing Dodd-Frank,
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:29.000]   repealing Sarbanes-Oxley, Federal Reserve monetary policy,
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:31.000]   creating personal social security accounts--
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.320]   I mean, all of this is, of course,
[01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:34.040]   has always been part of his agenda.
[01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:35.120]   But I mean, I think this is great.
[01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:38.720]   Judicial activism increased funding for brain science.
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:41.600]   I think this is fascinating.
[01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:46.160]   I just don't know if Hangouts is really the place to do that.
[01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:49.600]   Well, if there were some way--
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:52.680]   Now, I think Corbus, I appreciate you telling Newt
[01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:54.920]   that he's on Twitch, but I'm afraid he'll misunderstand
[01:06:54.920 --> 01:06:56.680]   that completely when you say you're on Twitch.
[01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:57.920]   It'd be like, I'm a Twitch.
[01:06:57.920 --> 01:06:59.600]   What are you talking about?
[01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:02.920]   Corbus von Duslossen.
[01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:04.720]   Let us move on to our picks of the week.
[01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:06.600]   But before we do that, I want to tell everybody
[01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:09.440]   about the best darn place to go to get audiobooks.
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:10.920]   I am such a fan.
[01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:11.840]   I don't have to tell.
[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:12.800]   Say it with me.
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:14.720]   Everybody, together now.
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:16.560]   [SINGING]
[01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:17.680]   I heard them all saying that.
[01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:20.240]   [SCREAMING]
[01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:24.160]   We're huge audible fans here at Twitch,
[01:07:24.160 --> 01:07:26.360]   not only because they were one of our first and best
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:27.360]   advertisers.
[01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:29.680]   They really supported Twitch, which is funny.
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:32.600]   Because in some ways, you might think audiobooks and podcasts
[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:33.680]   don't mix.
[01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:35.360]   But I think really the same people who
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:37.000]   like to listen to shows like this
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.880]   are going to love listening to books.
[01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:40.880]   And I do a lot of book listening.
[01:07:40.880 --> 01:07:42.240]   And I know all of you do, too.
[01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:43.840]   It's the only way I read text heavy.
[01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:46.280]   Nowadays, it's the only way to read anything.
[01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:48.720]   I was talking yesterday with some friends who read books
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:50.640]   on the Kindle or the iPad.
[01:07:50.640 --> 01:07:53.200]   And I said, you know, I read all the time.
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:55.800]   And the way I find time to do that is audible.
[01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:58.480]   I get an hour or two every day.
[01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:00.360]   Because I go to the gym, I drive carpool,
[01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:02.200]   I go to the grocery store, I clean house, whatever.
[01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:03.560]   I'm always listening to audible.
[01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:05.920]   And if you think about it, if you read an hour or two every day,
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:08.360]   you would get a lot of reading done.
[01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:09.560]   And this is all time that I really
[01:08:09.560 --> 01:08:11.640]   wouldn't have time to do anything.
[01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:13.800]   Because you know, my hands are busy.
[01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:15.240]   Did you see this zombie?
[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:18.000]   They're having some sort of zombie thing going on here.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.560]   What is this?
[01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:21.160]   Let me click this button.
[01:08:21.160 --> 01:08:21.720]   A zombie--
[01:08:21.720 --> 01:08:22.720]   Zombie Fest.
[01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:23.720]   Zombie Fest.
[01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:25.240]   Zombie Fest.
[01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:27.520]   More fun and horror than ever before.
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:29.880]   So audible is like the greatest bookstore ever.
[01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:31.720]   That, you know, like if you had a corner bookstore
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:34.480]   that you hung out at, audible is just like that.
[01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:37.320]   Except it's online at audible.com.
[01:08:37.320 --> 01:08:39.880]   More than 70,000 titles, totally.
[01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:42.720]   Many of them about zombies apparently.
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:47.000]   Four exclusive early release zombie novels.
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.760]   Wow, this is interesting.
[01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:52.720]   You can follow the zombie apocalypse in real time.
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:55.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:56.000]   Over on Twitter.
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.520]   Wow, this is cool.
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:00.480]   So if you're a fan-- look at see, they have videos.
[01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:08.280]   They've really done a lot to make this a community of readers.
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:08.960]   And I love that.
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:11.200]   And not just readers of zombie fiction,
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:18.120]   but of history of bestsellers, of literature, classics.
[01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:21.040]   Of course, you know, Audible's favorite reader
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:23.440]   is this man right here, Mr. Andy Inatko.
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:24.440]   Do you have an Audible pick for it?
[01:09:24.440 --> 01:09:26.640]   Oh, I agree on this one.
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:28.480]   Yeah, it's from the greatest hits file.
[01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:31.440]   I first bought David McCollocks John Adams,
[01:09:31.440 --> 01:09:33.080]   Art of your John Adams a couple of years ago.
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:36.760]   I think I might have selected it a couple of years ago too.
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:39.240]   It is one of my favorite books ever.
[01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:42.320]   Just yesterday, I realized that it has--
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:46.160]   I can't think of another book where I have bought this book
[01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:48.080]   in every format it has ever been.
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:49.080]   Me too.
[01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:51.520]   I like the audiobook so much, I bought the hardcover.
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:52.320]   You're right.
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:54.960]   I bought the hardcover after I read the hardcover.
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:56.160]   I bought the audiobook.
[01:09:56.160 --> 01:09:58.400]   When it came out on Kindle, I had to buy it on Kindle
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:09:59.920]   because that's where I was reading stuff.
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:03.200]   Yesterday, HBO did a marathon of the mini series
[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:06.120]   of Paul Giamatti based on this book.
[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:08.360]   And for the first time, I saw like two episodes in a row
[01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:11.040]   and I got so engrossed and I had so much I needed to do that day
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:14.440]   that I'm like, OK, let's go to Amazon and buy the DVD box
[01:10:14.440 --> 01:10:16.360]   so that I can have it.
[01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:21.520]   It's one of the rarely do you see in a biography three
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:24.040]   of these components come together at the same time.
[01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:26.360]   A guy who really knows how to write,
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:30.640]   writing about a truly interesting compelling character.
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:34.600]   And with the added touch that this guy, all of his correspondence
[01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:36.360]   was saved and survived.
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:38.800]   So it's not as though he's sort of making up.
[01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:41.280]   Well, here's sort of, I guess, what I imagine,
[01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:45.200]   somebody who was spending a few weeks
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:47.680]   opasses from Boston to London would be going through.
[01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:49.480]   It's no, he actually had the letters
[01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:51.040]   that he wrote about exactly everything
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:53.120]   that happened during that journey, what he was thinking
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:54.160]   and what it was feeling.
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:57.520]   He was not only a smart man, but also a very, very passionate man.
[01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:01.040]   And so chapter after chapter after chapter,
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:02.880]   I can't think of a single biography
[01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:06.640]   I've ever enjoyed more about the guy who more,
[01:11:06.640 --> 01:11:09.000]   probably more than any one individual person
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:13.200]   is responsible for the health of the great United States
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:14.720]   of frickin' America.
[01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:15.720]   - Of frickin' America.
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:17.000]   But it's actually one of the reasons,
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:18.320]   and I think 'cause it's fourth, it's July weekend,
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:19.160]   this is very appropriate.
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:21.200]   It's one of the, it kind of reinvented,
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:24.000]   I rediscovered US history because of this,
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.120]   because we'd all learned the legends
[01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:27.440]   of the founding fathers, you know?
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:28.840]   And there really is a lot of myth
[01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:30.240]   in what we learned in school.
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:31.720]   This is the facts.
[01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:33.760]   - And it's very different from what you might've thought.
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:35.920]   And it brings them to life, I think.
[01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:37.320]   - Right, and it's not just about John Adams,
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:39.320]   you really get to see a lot about all of the--
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:40.360]   - You bet. - What was happening
[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:41.800]   at that moment that he was dealing with,
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:44.560]   and you get a much clearer detail of what they were dealing with.
[01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:47.080]   He was underappreciated, but it just makes everybody human,
[01:11:47.080 --> 01:11:48.480]   and I really think there's one,
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:50.400]   and of course McCulloch is brilliant at that.
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:52.360]   - And you think about how important it was
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:54.160]   that all these battles got fought,
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:56.400]   but it was also important that you gotta send a dude over
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:59.840]   to A, convince the French to please get,
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:01.520]   we need your navy, we don't have one,
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:03.680]   but that's as strong as what we need to fight.
[01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:05.080]   Could you please send some ships?
[01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:08.720]   They need a guy to go to go and say,
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:11.600]   hi, yeah, Dutch guys, could you lend us like,
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:14.560]   oh, $10, $15 million just so we can keep this army going?
[01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:16.920]   'Cause we need to feed them and bullets.
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:19.400]   I mean, we keep asking the British for them back
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:22.000]   after we fire them, but they're not sending many of them back.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000]   - There's an unabridged version,
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000]   you could take your pick, I would suggest the unabridged,
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:27.360]   you won it all.
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:29.200]   I did listen to the abridged when it first came out,
[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:30.040]   'cause that's all they had,
[01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:32.640]   and now of course they have a full treatment of it,
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:35.640]   which I highly recommend, and here's the best part.
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:36.880]   It's yours for free right now,
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:40.640]   if you go to audible.com/macbreak.
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:42.600]   - Do you ever get the abridged versions of anything?
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:44.920]   - Not anymore, but in the early days of audiobooks,
[01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:46.600]   it was all abridged, remember?
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:47.880]   And that's one of the things audible,
[01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:50.760]   I think is really done as service to us all.
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:53.320]   They early on said, we're gonna make a commitment
[01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:56.800]   to an unabridged, to the full recording.
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:58.840]   It's one thing when you have to get cassettes and CDs,
[01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:01.560]   you could see why they might want to abridge a book like this,
[01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:05.520]   which is 30 hours, that's gonna be 30 CDs,
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:07.200]   the cost of that would be prohibitive,
[01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:10.080]   but once it's digital, why not have every word,
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:10.920]   why not have it all?
[01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:14.200]   So I think Audible's to be applauded for that.
[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:16.640]   You can go to audible.com/macbreak,
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:19.120]   get a subscription, it's a Book of Month subscription,
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:20.840]   that's their gold plan.
[01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:22.600]   First month's free, first book's free,
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:24.120]   and yours to keep cancel at any time,
[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:27.120]   so you got this book, it's yours, absolutely free.
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:29.920]   And what a great book to add to your collection.
[01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:33.880]   John Adams by David McCullough, one of our greatest historians,
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:36.000]   and also a brilliant narrator, he doesn't narrate this,
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.600]   but his voice, you will recognize from many documentaries,
[01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:40.280]   and he's just great, I love him.
[01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:41.600]   - Do you find yourself getting attached to books
[01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:43.040]   like you get to the end of one and you almost feel
[01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:43.880]   like you can't start a new one,
[01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:45.480]   because that was such a great experience.
[01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:46.320]   - Oh yeah. - You almost wanna go back
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:48.720]   and listen to it again, because you're just so attached to it.
[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:50.320]   - This is why you want an audible subscription,
[01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:51.840]   'cause what I do is I will get shorter books
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:55.040]   as palette cleansers, so I will do a long trilogy
[01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:56.640]   or a book like this, John Adams,
[01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:58.520]   and then I'll say, okay, palette cleanser,
[01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:01.680]   I'm gonna do Solaris, and then take a little break,
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:03.360]   and then I'll come back and do another trilogy
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:05.720]   or a long book, and that's why it's nice
[01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:07.480]   to have a subscription to this sucker.
[01:14:07.480 --> 01:14:11.080]   Audible.com, and I say that in the nicest way
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:12.960]   when I say sucker, audible.com,
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:15.360]   like a giant lollipop, you can't stop licking.
[01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:18.800]   It's getting worse, audible.com.
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:20.200]   - And we have a showtime.
[01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:25.040]   - Audible.com/MacBreak.
[01:14:25.120 --> 01:14:26.920]   - And by the way, if you listen to our shows,
[01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:28.560]   we have recommendations all the time.
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:29.680]   One of the things we decided to do,
[01:14:29.680 --> 01:14:30.880]   and one of the reasons these Audible ads
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:33.040]   have been very successful, frankly,
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:35.920]   is because we make it a little book club,
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:38.320]   and really the ad is only 30 seconds,
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:41.920]   so it's the review of the book that goes on and on and on,
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:42.760]   but I like that.
[01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:44.560]   I mean, to me, it's kinda fun.
[01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:47.760]   We're all readers, and I trust that many of you are as well,
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:50.520]   and so it's really fun to recommend great literature,
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:52.960]   great books, great history to our fans, and friends.
[01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:53.760]   - It's easy to talk about Audible,
[01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:55.480]   and then all of us use it heavily.
[01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:56.600]   - Oh yeah, yeah.
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:58.520]   Even Don does, I think, right?
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:14:59.760]   - I should do.
[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:01.960]   I did subscribe in the early days
[01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:03.920]   when there was a free offer on,
[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:05.280]   but I'm just so busy.
[01:15:05.280 --> 01:15:06.480]   I need to make more time for myself
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:07.480]   so I can do this sort of stuff.
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:08.840]   - You do, you do.
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:10.720]   Or do more laundry.
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:11.560]   - Yeah.
[01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:12.400]   (laughs)
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:15.040]   But I don't have a commute with working from the studio at home,
[01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:17.000]   so that's a bit of respect to this.
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.360]   - Yeah, I actually get the car and drive around in circles
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:20.920]   just so I can listen to all of it.
[01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:22.760]   - I see him, he just goes by my house.
[01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:23.800]   - I know he's gonna be back in 10 minutes.
[01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:26.080]   - You see the red Mustang, you know I'm listening to a book.
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:28.800]   Don McAllister, your pick of the week, sir.
[01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:31.320]   - Okay, right, I'm gonna do a Mac pick
[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:33.360]   since it's Mac-beregically free.
[01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:36.680]   And I'm gonna do a very simple little application
[01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:37.960]   that's available on the Mac App Store,
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:39.520]   or you can go to the website to get it.
[01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:42.080]   But it's something that I use quite a bit.
[01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:43.960]   In fact, I actually use it every day,
[01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:45.520]   and it sounds a bit weird,
[01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:47.000]   but I mean, I use to get you all the time
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.320]   for doing screenshots and capturing things with the screen,
[01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:52.040]   and then annotating them or saving them or undoing things.
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:53.680]   But I've found another use for wanting
[01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:54.880]   to capture bits of the screen,
[01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:57.600]   and that's the sort of uses like a virtual notepad.
[01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:01.920]   So I use this package now, which is called Screen Float.
[01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:03.800]   And basically what is, it's like sketching
[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:05.560]   that you can capture part of the screen,
[01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:08.640]   but it doesn't disappear when you move to another window.
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:10.240]   It basically floats above the screen
[01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:12.200]   until the start you've finished with it.
[01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:14.440]   So if there's a note on a webpage,
[01:16:14.440 --> 01:16:17.840]   it just wanna just snap very quickly to refer to.
[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:19.200]   I actually did it for itself.
[01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:22.840]   I mean, I snapped the information panel off the Mac App Store,
[01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:24.400]   and it's been sitting on the desktop ever since,
[01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:25.440]   and I've been on Twitter and everything,
[01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:26.680]   and looking around.
[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:28.720]   But it's really, really nice.
[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:31.880]   I use that a lot with capturing parameters in Final Cut Pro.
[01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:34.560]   So if there's some parameters that I want to capture quickly
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:37.440]   to either retype or just make a note on,
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:39.640]   well, I'll capture them using a Screen Float panel,
[01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:41.680]   and then it can stay on screen for as long as it wants,
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:42.600]   and then when I've finished with it,
[01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:43.440]   I'll just pop it away.
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:45.880]   It does have a library as well, so you can keep them.
[01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:48.400]   You can actually archive them and put them away
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:50.880]   so that you can actually recall them again for later on.
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:53.400]   But it's not fairly expensive.
[01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:56.320]   We have to stop saying this, because it's £4.99.
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:58.160]   I think it's about $7.99.
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:00.680]   - Yeah, very affordable. - The application.
[01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:02.240]   - I love the new era of apps.
[01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:03.080]   That's all I have to say.
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:05.000]   - Well, this is a perfect example of an app
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.320]   that you really wouldn't want to spend $49 on,
[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:09.240]   because you have this functionality built,
[01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:10.880]   not only built into OS X,
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:12.400]   but also built into things like Skitch,
[01:17:12.400 --> 01:17:13.440]   which you might already have.
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:14.680]   But it adds a little feature.
[01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:15.520]   I'm with you.
[01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:16.360]   I already bought it,
[01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:18.840]   because I like the problem with Skitch,
[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:20.200]   you have to drag it to the desktop,
[01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:21.520]   and then you can insert it.
[01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:24.200]   Just a simple little feature of having that float there
[01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:25.120]   is worth eight bucks to me.
[01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:26.360]   I think it's great. - Just try to get it
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:28.280]   on the screen until you want to get rid of it.
[01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:29.200]   It's fantastic.
[01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:30.280]   It's really, really good.
[01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:33.080]   - I'm constantly putting screenshots into blog posts
[01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:36.240]   or into G+ and stuff,
[01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:37.600]   and the ability to just drag it then,
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:38.480]   it would be really handy.
[01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:39.360]   So I'm going to buy this.
[01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:41.200]   Good pick, thank you, Don.
[01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:42.280]   I just installed it.
[01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:43.960]   (laughing)
[01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:45.160]   That's when you know a pick is good,
[01:17:45.160 --> 01:17:46.640]   it was when the entire panel just says,
[01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:48.080]   "Okay, I got it."
[01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:49.960]   Alex Lindsey, your pick of the week.
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:52.160]   So this one's a little self-serving, I admit,
[01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:56.240]   but this is a world announcement.
[01:17:56.240 --> 01:18:00.280]   (imitating droning)
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:01.640]   If you go to devigurage.com
[01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:03.240]   and you look at right down below,
[01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:06.480]   you have new Conduit 2.2 64-bit beta
[01:18:06.480 --> 01:18:09.040]   for Final Cut X and Motion 5.
[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:13.880]   So you are now making Final Cut Pro 10 plugins.
[01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:16.280]   - So the, and it's a beta.
[01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:18.760]   So this is a free beta, so you can download it.
[01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:21.440]   It costs, and it's going to go until the middle of August.
[01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:22.840]   We want people to play with it.
[01:18:22.840 --> 01:18:24.240]   - This will work in Motion 2.
[01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:25.120]   - Well, that's the big thing.
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:28.120]   So we did, I've said this before,
[01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:29.880]   we did 200 visual effects shots in Motion.
[01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:32.960]   Well, you could not have done it in Motion without Conduit
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:35.520]   because Conduit gives you basically this nodal interface
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:36.800]   that lets you build it.
[01:18:36.800 --> 01:18:39.880]   What we are kind of moving towards now
[01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:41.120]   is the idea that Conduit,
[01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:44.440]   this nodal visual programming interface,
[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:48.800]   lets you build very complex plugins for Final Cut
[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:50.200]   through Motion 5.
[01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:51.560]   - There's Carlita turning green.
[01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:54.440]   - Yes, there's Carlita and she was a game of nuts.
[01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:55.280]   Let me hear.
[01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:58.680]   - So you really do need this more advanced interface
[01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:00.080]   to be able to do really some sort of--
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:02.600]   - Well, you could do a lot of great things with Motion,
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:04.840]   but if you're going to do the high end compositing
[01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:08.840]   that we did for a couple of feature films in Motion,
[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:10.800]   you're going to need this interface to do it.
[01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:14.680]   And what this lets you do now is actually use this visual way.
[01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:15.960]   You don't have to write a lot of code,
[01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:18.520]   but you do a visual way of creating some really complex
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:21.160]   effects inside of Conduit and then publishing those
[01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:24.440]   out to Final Cut with just a couple simple sliders.
[01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:28.600]   It really, it takes your little chihuahua of,
[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:31.000]   in turns it into a big rockweiler really quickly.
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.200]   So anyway, so I don't know, I want to say the Motion 5,
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:38.200]   the chihuahua, it's more like a golden retriever.
[01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:40.760]   But it really adds a lot of teeth to it.
[01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:42.480]   So definitely check it out.
[01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:44.320]   It's free, it's free right now, which is not--
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:47.440]   - It's a public beta, we want people to bang on it
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:49.200]   and download it.
[01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:51.880]   And so anyway, definitely check that out.
[01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:55.400]   And also I will be showing it on our,
[01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:58.800]   we have usually an internal stream on Wednesdays
[01:19:58.800 --> 01:19:59.880]   called CSID.
[01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:01.840]   And I'll be showing that if you want to get more information
[01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:03.240]   about where to go for that, you'll be able to go
[01:20:03.240 --> 01:20:05.800]   to pickscore.com/live, but you can follow me on
[01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:08.400]   Alex Lindsay or at pickscore.
[01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:10.360]   You can follow pickscore on Twitter and we'll announce
[01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:11.400]   that, hey, we're going live.
[01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:13.080]   And that'll be tomorrow afternoon.
[01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:14.680]   And so definitely check it out.
[01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:17.520]   It is, we're pretty excited about it.
[01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:18.720]   - Cool, it's all I have to say.
[01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:20.280]   - Cool, great pick.
[01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:22.920]   And now is your turn, Andy and Nato.
[01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:25.720]   - This is a great camera app for the iPhone
[01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:29.200]   that I've been just nuts about since I downloaded about a week ago.
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:30.520]   It's called Synth Cam.
[01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:33.960]   And it has an approach to what I love about the camera
[01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:36.200]   and the iPhone is not only is it a good
[01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:39.920]   just snapshot sort of camera, but the idea of,
[01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:42.600]   the camera is not really just the lens and the image sensor.
[01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:44.880]   It's actually the app that runs it.
[01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:47.520]   And so the app can actually have a really cool approach
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:49.520]   to how to put a photo together.
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:53.400]   What Synth Cam does is it takes still photos,
[01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:56.360]   but it uses the video camera, not the still camera.
[01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:58.560]   You know, that there's a still five megapixel camera,
[01:20:58.560 --> 01:20:59.800]   but then there's the HD camera.
[01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:02.960]   What it does, and unfortunately, I've got a couple sample
[01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:04.200]   that I'm gonna take to show what it does.
[01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:07.920]   Essentially what it does is everything,
[01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:09.400]   when you take a picture with it,
[01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:11.840]   essentially it turns on the video camera
[01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:13.040]   and starts recording.
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:16.520]   When you turn off, when you tell it to stop recording,
[01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:20.160]   the basic principle is that anything that stays the same
[01:21:20.160 --> 01:21:23.040]   from frame to frame will be in sharp focus.
[01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:25.760]   Anything that changed will not be in focus.
[01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:28.320]   - And the best way to sort of show this is this picture
[01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:31.240]   of this watch face.
[01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:32.240]   You can see like the sweep, second hand.
[01:21:32.240 --> 01:21:33.360]   - That's cool.
[01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:34.200]   Right.
[01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:35.360]   Now, okay, so that's one way,
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:37.080]   that's one cool thing you can do with it,
[01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:39.160]   'cause okay, so if you have someone running from left to right,
[01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:41.320]   you'll have ghosted images.
[01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:42.160]   - Yeah.
[01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:43.560]   - But it's such a flexible tool.
[01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:47.760]   This has, I'm gonna show you three really cool things
[01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:50.640]   that this simple effect does.
[01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:54.680]   So if you've ever shot low light stuff with the iPhone,
[01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:56.240]   you know that the only answer,
[01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:59.200]   if you're trying to shoot like a monument in a park at night,
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:01.720]   the only solution the iPhone has is to crank up
[01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:04.320]   the eye sensitivity as high as it'll go,
[01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:06.560]   which means you wind up with all this really horrible
[01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:09.880]   like film grain, like noise and static all over the image.
[01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:11.000]   It's almost useless.
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:14.080]   So if you have, if you shoot the same picture
[01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:16.480]   with synth cam, remember that,
[01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:18.720]   and especially if you lean your the eye photo,
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:20.880]   like have it really hold it nice and steady
[01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:22.480]   or even better yet have it on a tripod
[01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:23.560]   or lean it against something.
[01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:24.680]   So it doesn't move.
[01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:27.240]   The only thing that will change from frame to frame
[01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:28.640]   will be that amount of static.
[01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:29.960]   So the result is, and unfortunately,
[01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:31.600]   if you have this actual photo,
[01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:36.080]   you would see that the result is this perfectly smooth photo
[01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:37.360]   with no noise whatsoever.
[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:39.880]   This was shot at 1000 ISO,
[01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:43.240]   and there's no grain whatsoever to be seen anywhere.
[01:22:43.240 --> 01:22:44.840]   - And it's free.
[01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:45.680]   - And it's free.
[01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:48.520]   But let me show you a cool thing too.
[01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:51.800]   For instance, here's a shot of Mrs. Holstein
[01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:54.280]   at the Wallfam fish letter.
[01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:56.120]   And this is like a very conventional photo
[01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:59.120]   in that, you know, it's the foreground,
[01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:00.240]   the background is sharp.
[01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:01.440]   If you want to do something,
[01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:03.840]   if you had a real camera, you might want to do bokeh effects.
[01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:05.640]   You might want the foreground to be sharp,
[01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:07.680]   the background to be out of focus.
[01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:11.680]   So here's the same shot taken with synth cam.
[01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:13.000]   So now you have the background
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.040]   and it's blurry, the foreground is nice and sharp.
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:16.360]   - Now how do you get the bridge blurry
[01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:18.120]   because it's not moving, right?
[01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:20.400]   - Well, because this is a really good example
[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:22.640]   because you tell the app,
[01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:25.440]   when as you're holding the iPhone,
[01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:27.120]   essentially you can set a target saying,
[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:29.960]   "I want this part to be sharp all the time."
[01:23:29.960 --> 01:23:32.560]   So when it assembles from all those video frames,
[01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:35.200]   it will line everything up so that this part you selected
[01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:36.840]   will always be lined up.
[01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:39.360]   And because there's so much, in this case,
[01:23:39.360 --> 01:23:40.600]   because there's so much distance
[01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:42.320]   between the foreground and the background,
[01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:45.520]   there's going to be some like inadvertent camera shake
[01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:50.080]   because the background is so much further away
[01:23:50.080 --> 01:23:51.120]   from the foreground,
[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:52.640]   there's going to be more shake evident
[01:23:52.640 --> 01:23:53.960]   in the background and the foreground.
[01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:58.520]   So the result is you can have nice bokeh type effects.
[01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:01.880]   And it really, you can set one, two, three or four points.
[01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:04.640]   I've only mastered using it with one point.
[01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:05.560]   If you use multiple points,
[01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:07.720]   you can do things like forced perspective
[01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:09.480]   tilt shift effects.
[01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:11.560]   But the other cool thing is that now imagine
[01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:12.480]   if you're doing something,
[01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:16.240]   here is a picture of that, the wall fan fish letter.
[01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:19.600]   And again, pretty standard photo of a waterfall.
[01:24:19.600 --> 01:24:22.720]   If you take it with synth cam, here's what it looks like.
[01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:26.080]   It's like having all the water has essentially turned
[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:28.760]   to mist because remember the water was running
[01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:31.120]   while the shutter was open, so to speak.
[01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:35.880]   So it's like having, it's like when you take a shot
[01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:37.760]   at a wide, at a low aperture,
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:39.920]   but you put like a piece of smoke glass in front of the lens
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:42.640]   so that you have, the shutter is open for like, you know,
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:44.120]   40 seconds.
[01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:48.280]   So there's so, as a result, it looks like it's like smoke
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:53.080]   running down these steps as opposed to like splashes of water.
[01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:54.440]   So there's so many different,
[01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:57.440]   so it's such a great app to have handy
[01:24:57.440 --> 01:25:00.440]   because there are going to be so many times when
[01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:04.960]   you have the idea that gosh, this would be a much prettier photo.
[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:09.280]   If I were getting like a night shot
[01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:12.040]   in which cars are driving by, I want to see like the trails
[01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:14.240]   of the headlights or here's running water
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:16.240]   and I want the water to be out of focus.
[01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:18.960]   Or I want to make sure that the background is blurry
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:20.160]   because I'm actually more interested
[01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:21.680]   in the subjects in the foreground.
[01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:25.680]   It's a free app, it's a little bit difficult to use at first
[01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:28.240]   before you figure out exactly how it works.
[01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:31.400]   The other problem is that because it's putting together
[01:25:31.400 --> 01:25:34.720]   a final photo based on the HD camera,
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:36.600]   you're not going to get five megapixel photos.
[01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:38.920]   You will get essentially 720,
[01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:41.480]   it'll be like a frame off of a 720p video.
[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:43.800]   So in terms of resolution,
[01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:48.000]   but when you look at things like again, night shot photography,
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.720]   I really do think that you'll get better photos
[01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:55.240]   from this app because of the total lack of any noise whatsoever
[01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:58.520]   versus what you'd get from five megapixels
[01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:00.960]   with all that noise and all that grain involved.
[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:03.320]   In any event, it's one of those great apps
[01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:04.960]   that you just have on the phone,
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:09.200]   just like those apps that will not take the picture
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:11.880]   until it senses that there's no movement of the camera.
[01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:14.240]   If you have this app on the phone at some point,
[01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:16.480]   you'll be in a situation where it's exactly the right way
[01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:19.040]   to get the right photo at the right time.
[01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:21.360]   And it's written by an interesting fella.
[01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:23.160]   Is it Mark LeVoy?
[01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:26.240]   He's a professor at Stanford.
[01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:31.440]   In fact, he teaches their course in iOS software development.
[01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:33.040]   And so it's kind of neat.
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:35.840]   A lot of very well known apps have come out of that,
[01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:37.400]   famous Stanford class.
[01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:39.720]   And I think it's good that the professor does one too,
[01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:42.120]   and happens to do a very, very, very good one.
[01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:44.240]   That's great.
[01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:45.920]   Thank you, Andy, great pick.
[01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:47.640]   Mine is a very simple pick,
[01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:50.080]   but something perhaps you'll want to pay attention to.
[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:53.000]   And it is a website that is going to tell you,
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.440]   it's roaringapps.com,
[01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:59.600]   whether your app is compatible with Lion.
[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:02.240]   And this is something we kind of all need right about now.
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:05.520]   Roaringapps.com.
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:08.240]   And they've got little checkboxes next to,
[01:27:08.240 --> 01:27:12.120]   with green lights next to the apps that do work fine.
[01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:14.640]   Yellow exclamation marks next to the ones that don't,
[01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:16.800]   and question marks next to the one they're not sure about.
[01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:19.400]   You could add your input and help,
[01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:20.600]   because it's a wiki.
[01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:22.320]   And I think it's a really good idea for a wiki.
[01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:25.800]   An application compatibility wiki for OS 10,
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:30.600]   lion roaringapps.com.
[01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:32.240]   One more thing to add to the list,
[01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:35.240]   and make sure you go to us Don's Screencast online,
[01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:37.400]   watch his screencast on getting ready for Lion.
[01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:39.600]   I hope we get it sooner than July 20th.
[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:42.280]   We got it nice to get it soon.
[01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:45.520]   I just want to see the new machines if they come out.
[01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:46.360]   That's what I'm excited about.
[01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:47.960]   They all have new errors at the same time.
[01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:49.080]   I don't care about the new areas.
[01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:52.560]   I want minis and Mac Pros is what I'm interested in.
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:53.760]   Like I think it's those are way--
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:55.320]   Minis do for an update.
[01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:56.480]   Mac Pros are do for an update too.
[01:27:56.480 --> 01:27:57.320]   Are they?
[01:27:57.320 --> 01:27:58.320]   Yeah, they're long in the tooth.
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:27:59.160]   They got really--
[01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:03.120]   I have a nice eight core i7 Mac Pro.
[01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:05.160]   I'm not feeling too bad about.
[01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:06.840]   They don't have Thunderbolt.
[01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:08.600]   It's all about Thunderbolt, isn't it?
[01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:09.520]   It's all about--
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:11.600]   Well, for the people who are using the Mac Pros,
[01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:12.560]   absolutely.
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:14.720]   You know, and that's a Pro solution.
[01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:17.240]   And I do have my error that it's also fairly recent,
[01:28:17.240 --> 01:28:18.800]   less than a year old, and I would--
[01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:20.680]   I'm going to be bummed when they come out with a new error.
[01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:22.760]   But OK, fine.
[01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:24.480]   Fine, fine, fine.
[01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:27.200]   You will find Don McAllister at Screencast online.
[01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:28.760]   That's the place to go.
[01:28:28.760 --> 01:28:29.960]   Indeed.
[01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:32.440]   You can also get that Screencast you did this week
[01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:33.760]   on Get Ready for Lions.
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:36.280]   Yeah, I still have that special offer as well.
[01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:38.200]   So it's a membership site.
[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:40.240]   So I do put out some free videos.
[01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:41.640]   I put out a free video every month.
[01:28:41.640 --> 01:28:43.840]   But to get the weekly video, you do have to be a member.
[01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:46.320]   But there is a coupon code that's been ongoing now
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:48.400]   for quite a while called Mac Break Weekly.
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:48.920]   Yeah.
[01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:51.880]   And it gets you 50% off the initial joining fee, which is--
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:53.840]   I'll put some like $28 or something.
[01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:56.240]   Is that one word Mac Break Weekly?
[01:28:56.240 --> 01:28:58.240]   Mac Break Weekly, yes.
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:00.000]   Must have.
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:01.000]   Become a member.
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.240]   Do it now.
[01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:06.880]   Because you want that to get ready for Lion, if nothing else.
[01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:08.520]   Yeah, they can see it on the front page there.
[01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:09.400]   Well, that's this week's show.
[01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:10.760]   But that will change tomorrow.
[01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:13.360]   I'm going to release tomorrow's show early with me going off.
[01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:16.320]   So it's a final good pro 10 tomorrow.
[01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:18.080]   Oh, how exciting.
[01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:19.800]   Well, you work fast.
[01:29:19.800 --> 01:29:21.160]   Don, always a pleasure having you on.
[01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:22.360]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:23.280]   We really appreciate it.
[01:29:23.280 --> 01:29:26.160]   Screencastsonline.com.
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:29.600]   She's not at all pink in that shot.
[01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:31.320]   Thanks, Don.
[01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:34.280]   Thanks to Andy and I go for joining us in his dog Spot.
[01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:39.120]   Andy is available in the beautiful pages.
[01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:40.240]   He got them, but he didn't need them.
[01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:41.240]   It turns out.
[01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:41.840]   And the pages--
[01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:42.840]   Oh, he's always good.
[01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:43.880]   He's always welcome.
[01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:45.520]   The Chicago Sun Times, and of course,
[01:29:45.520 --> 01:29:48.120]   online at the Celestial Waste of Ban Within,
[01:29:48.120 --> 01:29:50.760]   these @innaco on Twitter.
[01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:54.360]   That's spelled I have no idea how to spell it.
[01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:57.960]   I-H-N-A-T-K-O.
[01:29:57.960 --> 01:29:58.440]   Thanks, Andy.
[01:29:58.440 --> 01:30:01.760]   Great to have you here.
[01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:04.720]   Finally, last but not least from the Pixelcore.
[01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:07.960]   Pixelcore.com for the Guild of Multimedia Artists
[01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:10.440]   and Pixelcore.tv for the great podcasts that they make.
[01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:12.400]   We got another live stream coming up on Thursday.
[01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:12.900]   What are you doing?
[01:30:12.900 --> 01:30:14.240]   We're doing this every Thursday now.
[01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:15.600]   Every Thursday, there's something different.
[01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:18.520]   So we're doing-- it's going to be Gear Media Tech Live.
[01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:20.200]   So we're bringing back Gear Media Tech.
[01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:22.840]   We're going to be talking about podcast stuff,
[01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:24.920]   everything from audio production and video production
[01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:26.320]   to some post-production stuff.
[01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:27.960]   And so we're going to be going through that.
[01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:30.800]   That's 6 p.m. live at Pixelcore.com.
[01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:34.280]   And you can just follow me or Pixelcore on Twitter.
[01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:38.040]   We're also going to be talking about Conduit next tomorrow.
[01:30:38.040 --> 01:30:38.560]   Oh, great.
[01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:40.040]   3 p.m. Pacific Standard Time.
[01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:41.160]   But we'll put that out.
[01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:42.920]   So let's come in up.
[01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:43.400]   Very excited.
[01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:44.240]   Very fun.
[01:30:44.240 --> 01:30:45.560]   We thank you all for joining us.
[01:30:45.560 --> 01:30:47.920]   Don't forget that you can still buy a brick.
[01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:49.960]   But the time is running out because we
[01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:55.120]   will be occupying the Twit Brick House July 24th.
[01:30:55.120 --> 01:30:56.120]   So exciting.
[01:30:56.120 --> 01:30:56.800]   We're very excited.
[01:30:56.800 --> 01:30:59.320]   Our first show will be Twit that Sunday.
[01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:01.880]   And then that whole week, we've got extra chairs.
[01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:03.520]   So we'll have up to 50 people in.
[01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:04.640]   If you want to come see Mac--
[01:31:04.640 --> 01:31:06.680]   There's plenty of room.
[01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:08.120]   If you want to see Mac Break Weekly,
[01:31:08.120 --> 01:31:10.880]   our first Mac Break Weekly will be on July 26th
[01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:11.880]   from the Twit Brick House.
[01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:12.720]   You can come.
[01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:14.880]   And we have room for 50.
[01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:17.040]   Now, this from now on is an absolute must.
[01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:21.000]   You have to email Eva, EVA, my sister, at twit.tv,
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:22.720]   to reserve your spot if you're going
[01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:24.520]   to come be part of the studio audience.
[01:31:24.520 --> 01:31:27.960]   We want to make sure that everybody who wants to can get in.
[01:31:27.960 --> 01:31:32.560]   But we do have lots of space, but we also anticipate lots
[01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:33.600]   of people.
[01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:36.080]   So please, Eva at twit.tv if you want to come.
[01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:38.240]   But we would love to have you in studio with us.
[01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:40.400]   I think it'd be really great.
[01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:42.880]   And if you would like to buy a brick,
[01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:47.960]   you'd be in spirit with us in studio 24/7.
[01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:49.840]   Our wall of honor is about to go up.
[01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:54.680]   We're going to pave the entryway lobby with bricks
[01:31:54.680 --> 01:31:57.400]   from of our fans and in supporters.
[01:31:57.400 --> 01:31:58.960]   And your name could be right there.
[01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:00.240]   Your logo too.
[01:32:00.240 --> 01:32:01.800]   If you go to bricks.twit.tv, you
[01:32:01.800 --> 01:32:04.520]   can see the prices and the list of different things
[01:32:04.520 --> 01:32:05.240]   you can do.
[01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:15.000]   If you're outside the US call us toll free 1-855-T-W-I-T-B-R-X.
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:17.720]   1-855-TWIT-B-R-X.
[01:32:17.720 --> 01:32:21.200]   And you too could be part of the Twit Brick House.
[01:32:21.200 --> 01:32:22.280]   We're very excited.
[01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:24.440]   It's costing a lot of money to build this.
[01:32:24.440 --> 01:32:27.080]   That's one of the reasons we're raising money through bricks.
[01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:29.360]   But we're in good shape.
[01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:30.800]   I think we're going to raise a lot of money.
[01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:31.440]   It's also--
[01:32:31.440 --> 01:32:32.160]   It's beautiful.
[01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:33.440]   The studio just looks great.
[01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:35.680]   And I want to think I wanted to reassure people.
[01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:37.640]   A lot of people say, oh, Leo, it's going to ruin Twit.
[01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:40.400]   It's going to ruin the casualness, the laid back atmosphere.
[01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:42.800]   No, we're going to be just as bad as ever.
[01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:45.600]   We'll just have more space to do it, more capabilities.
[01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:48.040]   My goal is not to make Twit bigger at all,
[01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:51.800]   just to make it better to give us more capabilities.
[01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:55.120]   The reality is this wasn't really designed for one man show.
[01:32:55.120 --> 01:32:58.200]   And it's now turned into a much larger enterprise.
[01:32:58.200 --> 01:33:00.240]   And things like the LAN party we want to do--
[01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:01.760]   Alex and I were talking about something else
[01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:05.160]   we really like to do using that space on Saturday nights.
[01:33:05.160 --> 01:33:08.280]   And there's just a lot of stuff that I'd like to do.
[01:33:08.280 --> 01:33:10.200]   So that gets us to do it.
[01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:15.320]   Without, in any way, improving the quality of our performance.
[01:33:15.320 --> 01:33:20.040]   In fact, we're thinking we're going to some standard deaf circa
[01:33:20.040 --> 01:33:22.720]   1990--
[01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:25.960]   Well, somebody asked me, actually, all of our video downloads
[01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:27.440]   will now be--
[01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:28.200]   but not-- oh, I'm sorry.
[01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:29.120]   I take it back.
[01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:30.840]   We'll offer exactly what we are offering right now.
[01:33:30.840 --> 01:33:34.640]   But we will also offer a 720p version, a high-def version
[01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:36.520]   of all of our shows and video.
[01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:40.120]   And I'm talking with a company called Influxus
[01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:43.200]   with doing a paid-- because it's expensive to do high-def
[01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:44.160]   streaming.
[01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:46.160]   That's a lot of bandwidth.
[01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:48.160]   And we can't afford to just give away that bandwidth.
[01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:51.520]   And none of our partners right now do high-def streaming.
[01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:52.560]   But Influxus does.
[01:33:52.560 --> 01:33:58.360]   And so we're talking about making that a premium for subscribers,
[01:33:58.360 --> 01:33:59.760]   people who are already donating.
[01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:01.360]   In fact, I think if you buy a brick,
[01:34:01.360 --> 01:34:03.320]   you will guarantee that everybody who buys a brick
[01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:05.920]   will get in on that, at least for the first few months.
[01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:07.680]   It won't be forever.
[01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:10.560]   But that'll be one of the benefits of buying a brick.
[01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:12.320]   So we will offer an HD stream at some point.
[01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:13.920]   Of course, you'll have to have a lot of bandwidth.
[01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:16.960]   The other reason we don't do it is it requires a lot of bandwidth
[01:34:16.960 --> 01:34:19.160]   on your end, as well as ours.
[01:34:19.160 --> 01:34:19.760]   But that's exciting.
[01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:20.800]   So there's a lot more that we can do.
[01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:21.960]   Everything's in high-def now.
[01:34:21.960 --> 01:34:25.600]   And as a result, we can give you a high-def broadcast.
[01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:26.680]   So thank you for your support.
[01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:27.280]   We appreciate it.
[01:34:27.280 --> 01:34:28.680]   bricks.twit.tv.
[01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:34.720]   Thank you all for being here for Mac Break Weekly, episode 254.

[01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:46.000]   Come by on a Tuesday.

[01:34:58.520 --> 01:34:59.880]   Now get back to work.
[01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:01.120]   Break time is over.
[01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:04.080]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:07.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:10.020]   (upbeat music)
