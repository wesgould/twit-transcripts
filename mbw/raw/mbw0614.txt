[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly. Renee Richie is not here, but good news, Laurie Gill.
[00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.540]   His compadre at iMoor.com is along with Alex Lindsey and Andy Inaco.
[00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.020]   We've got some more thoughts on WWDC, and we decided to talk to a developer,
[00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.220]   Rich Segal from Bearbone Software will be here to explain why he's coming back to the Mac App Store.
[00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.820]   That's all up next on Mac Break Weekly.

[00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.140]   It's time for Mac Break Weekly, the show we cover the latest news from Apple.
[00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.980]   We got a great panel for you.
[00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.220]   Let me introduce the regulars.
[00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.500]   And then we'll talk to a special guest joining us today.
[00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.500]   Andy Enocho is here from Enocho.com.
[00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.020]   Great to have you, sir.
[00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.020]   Great to be a Tuesday again and be talking to you.
[00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:12.860]   Apparently, I guess you're going to announce your new gig at the Hayward Fire Department.
[00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.300]   It turns out they were still using HTML 1.2 for their website, so I got them into a new
[00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.780]   site design that involves tables.
[00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.660]   Very nice, very nice.
[00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:25.660]   And I frames.
[00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:26.660]   Always good.
[00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.620]   Well, I couldn't sell them on that, but I did let them get to that JavaScript thing
[00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.340]   so that when you put your mouse over a box, it turns a different color.
[00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.340]   Baby steps.
[00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.340]   AJ, baby.
[00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.900]   The plus side is there is zero dependency, so it's not as though I'm committing them to
[00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.820]   a whole bunch of third party frameworks that nobody documents.
[00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:57.580]   So the man of the Pixel Core is man of the hour, Mr. Alex Lindsey, a L-E-X-L-I-N-D-S-A-Y
[00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.260]   on Twitter, Alex.
[00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.020]   Nice to see you.
[00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.660]   We got to turn Alex's mic on, though, if he's going to join the show.
[00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:04.660]   Just a minor detail.
[00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.620]   Can we hear him now?
[00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:07.620]   Hello, hello.
[00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.380]   Oh, only if you say something.
[00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.380]   Yes.
[00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.380]   Great to see you.
[00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.380]   Good to see you too.
[00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.700]   And Renee Richie wasn't going to be on the show, but he missed his plate, right?
[00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.860]   So good news.
[00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.260]   And we got somebody better, Lori Gill, Deputy Managing Editor at IMOR.
[00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.860]   Lori joined Renee Richie and Serenity Caldwell at the WWDC.
[00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:34.780]   But you have a unique perspective because you were at both WWDC and Google I/O.
[00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.300]   I have lots to say.
[00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.380]   I think that's very interesting.
[00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.080]   But I want to introduce our special guest, a guy we love and know when we've had on before
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.820]   Rich Segal, he is the guy in charge of BearBones software, BearBones.com, creator of
[00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.740]   the single most useful program on every Macintosh BB Edit.
[00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:54.740]   Hi, Rich.
[00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:55.740]   Good to see you.
[00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:56.740]   Hi, Leo.
[00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:57.740]   It's good to be here.
[00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:03.620]   Your ears are probably burning at WWDC because they mentioned BB Edit.
[00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.780]   And my jaw dropped in the context.
[00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:13.340]   They mentioned panic, transmit, and BearBones BB Edit would be on the App Store with the
[00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.540]   new Mojave.
[00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.540]   That's right.
[00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.500]   I thought we have to get Rich on.
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.300]   Well, please, I know you've got to be politic and you've got to be nice to Apple.
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.260]   But you had very famously said we can't be on the App Store with BB Edit.
[00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.860]   Yeah.
[00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:37.820]   So back in October 2014, I think it was, we got to this decision where we looked at sort
[00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:43.740]   of what it took to be in the App Store and the changes we had to make to the product and
[00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:49.540]   the way we had to have really sort of two different products for one for App Store customers
[00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.060]   and one for not App Store customers.
[00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:58.540]   And at the time, we reached the decision that it just wasn't a good fit for us.
[00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.420]   And time passed, we've had a lot of conversations with Apple.
[00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.420]   And now we're at that place where we feel like they're hearing us.
[00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:11.740]   They feel like they have heard us and we feel like they are pushing the technology forward.
[00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:17.180]   So now we sort of got to the place where we said, "Oh, okay, it looks like we can now
[00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:24.140]   be in the App Store and we can sell direct and we can sell the same product to both customers,
[00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:28.620]   both sets of customers and everybody wins."
[00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.580]   So that's where we ended up.
[00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.860]   There are two negatives to, well, there's several probably, but two big negatives to
[00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.980]   being in the App Store developers talk about.
[00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:42.180]   There's a technical negative and there's a commercial negative.
[00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.940]   One of the negatives is you don't have a direct relationship with your customers anymore.
[00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.260]   It's intermediated through Apple.
[00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.740]   I mean, they take 30 percent, maybe you get the value for that.
[00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.180]   But I'm thinking a larger way.
[00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.740]   You don't get access to them.
[00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:58.740]   That's right.
[00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:04.980]   Apple keeps their customer information very close at hand, developers who sell in the
[00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:10.780]   apps or don't know who the customer is unless the customer reaches out to us as, of course,
[00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.340]   they can do any time for assistance.
[00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:16.260]   And that challenge is still there for us.
[00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.340]   There's really nothing we can do about it.
[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:25.060]   Apple knows how we feel about it and we've said kind of all we can.
[00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.900]   So that issue is still there.
[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.900]   We're going to live with it.
[00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:31.900]   Yeah.
[00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:32.900]   All right.
[00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:38.220]   It's worth living with it because if you especially get featured at WWC keynote or you're featured
[00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:42.420]   in the App Store, they're going to have more editorial stuff in the App Store so there'll
[00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:44.220]   be more opportunities to be featured.
[00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.140]   It's a great way to let people know about what you do.
[00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:52.980]   So maybe it's a good way to build your sales even if you don't get the email addresses
[00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.100]   of your customers.
[00:06:54.100 --> 00:07:00.820]   The second issue though is a technical issue and that has to do with the sandbox.
[00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:04.940]   The limitations that App Store apps have on.
[00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:09.340]   Now I can understand why Panic said we can't do an FTP program because we don't get access
[00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:11.020]   to the file system.
[00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:16.220]   But I got the sense that this in Mojave, this is going to change.
[00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:21.140]   So access to the file system for sandboxed applications has always been sort of a very
[00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:24.180]   fluid notion.
[00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:28.940]   When you're in a sandbox, you certainly don't get unrestricted access to the file system.
[00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:33.060]   The security folks at Apple, they're very clear on this.
[00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:37.780]   The notion is not so much that they don't want apps doing anything.
[00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:42.020]   It's just that they're very conscious about wanting to protect the user's data.
[00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:48.620]   So there are ways that you can request access to parts of the file system outside of the
[00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:49.620]   sandbox.
[00:07:49.620 --> 00:08:00.140]   There are mechanisms that you can use and that are supported for 1014.
[00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:06.620]   You can request certain, what they're called, entitlements in which your application is
[00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:12.420]   allowed to look in certain places.
[00:08:12.420 --> 00:08:17.460]   So the technology has advanced to the point there where again for 1014 we can address
[00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:23.540]   a lot of those issues head on and then have an application that our users can use.
[00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:27.980]   They can read the file system, they can do multi file search and replace operations.
[00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:29.700]   It'll be fully functional.
[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:33.100]   Will the command line features of BBEd be functional as well?
[00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:39.940]   I love the fact that I have a worksheet that can be the bash shell.
[00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:43.420]   It's kind of like the old Mac programmer's workshop where you can see previous commands.
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:44.420]   You get it all.
[00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:45.420]   I love that.
[00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:46.420]   You can edit them.
[00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:47.420]   It'll also be functional.
[00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:49.220]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:54.820]   That's an essential part of the plan is to have the product that is completely and fully
[00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:57.500]   functional for both App Store and not App Store.
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.580]   So there'll be a difference between BBEdEd and the App Store.
[00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:01.940]   You buy it direct from bare bones.
[00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:03.660]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:04.660]   That's the plan.
[00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.060]   That's the intention.
[00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:13.060]   We do have a lot of time between now and when Mojave ships and the details, of course,
[00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:17.460]   some of them still need to be flattened out technologically and we have a great deal of
[00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:20.180]   work and testing to do.
[00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:22.140]   That's the plan.
[00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:29.500]   We and Apple share an understanding of that plan and this is a plan that's going to happen.
[00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:33.860]   The other thing, and I'm not a Mac OS developer, so you'll have to correct me if I'm saying
[00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:35.620]   something dumb.
[00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:41.180]   My understanding is an application when it's installed on Mac OS has to request entitlements,
[00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.980]   the ability to do certain things.
[00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:45.580]   By the way, I'm not against any of this.
[00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:48.260]   I completely understand Apple's point of view here.
[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.340]   It does enhance security.
[00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:55.100]   It's appropriate to sandbox applications and as long as you could still buy apps direct
[00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:59.820]   from the developer and not through the App Store, it doesn't hinder anybody in the Macintosh
[00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:03.540]   who wants to do something with more capability.
[00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.460]   I like buying stuff in the App Store.
[00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:10.240]   I like the notion of the security it provides and I would like to see more apps like BBEd
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.660]   available in the App Store.
[00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:15.620]   Do they change the entitlements?
[00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:23.060]   The notion of entitlements is entitlements are also almost like a programming language.
[00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:29.620]   You can write whatever entitlements you like and then the question is, are you allowed
[00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:34.420]   to use those entitlements for an app that is sold through the App Store?
[00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:36.700]   Really there are two sides to the issue here.
[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:42.840]   One of them is technological and the other is a matter of policy.
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:48.760]   You can write entitlements that allow your application to do whatever you think it should.
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:55.760]   Then, once you've tested that and made sure it works, then you need to get review permission
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:11:01.200]   from App Review to use them.
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:06.640]   That is one of those, as I said, it's a bifurcated issue.
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:10.780]   We can request entitlements to do certain things.
[00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:17.140]   We have a reasonable expectation based on being able to justify those entitlements that
[00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:21.420]   will be allowed to have those entitlements in the App Store.
[00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:27.380]   It is conceivable that when the rubber hits the road and you submit your app and you've
[00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:30.340]   requested these entitlements, the entitlements of course that are in the app that you get
[00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:34.380]   directly from bare bones that Apple may say, "No, you can't."
[00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:37.880]   You've had the conversations that give you the expectation that they'll say, "Yeah, that's
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:38.880]   fine."
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.240]   What are the sticking points?
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:46.280]   What are the things that you couldn't do before that you'll be able to do now?
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:52.560]   Well, the biggest thing that we couldn't do before was any operation that requested administrative
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:59.640]   privileges, for example, installing the command line tools that you could use to run BBEdit.
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:04.900]   The ability to open or save files that you don't normally have permission to open or
[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:06.560]   save.
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:12.480]   We're having conversations with Apple about those issues, but again, the feeling we've
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:19.720]   got is they understand our requirement to have this fully functional product.
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:24.320]   They understand that we are not willing to sacrifice features in the name of being the
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.720]   App Store.
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:32.600]   Another position is instead of saying, "You can't do that," and then putting us in the
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:38.040]   position of having to work around it, which is where we were a few years ago, now our
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:44.480]   sense is what we're hearing, what we're feeling is from Apple is, let's figure out how to
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.280]   make this work.
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.280]   Wow.
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:52.440]   Of all the developers, you and Panicker in the best situation because they've already
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:55.600]   pre-announced the availability.
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.520]   There's a lot of incentive for them to make this work for you.
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:03.000]   But I gather that if it doesn't have 100% functionality equivalents between your direct
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.480]   sale product and the Mac App Store product, you won't do it.
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:13.280]   I think if we see that there isn't 100% equivalents, they're going to figure out how
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:16.240]   to get us there.
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:18.640]   That's how we're looking at it.
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:25.080]   As far as we can sense, that's how our contacts at Apple are looking at it as well.
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:29.800]   I've been monopolizing, Andy, I know you and Richard friends, you hang out at the diner
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:33.040]   together drinking your coffee milk.
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:37.400]   It's widely known that we never talk.
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:38.920]   You just sit in the diner together.
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.120]   You stare at each other and shrink your cup.
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:45.760]   But if anybody, Lori, Andy, Alex, if you have any questions for Rich, I am monopolizing
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.120]   about I'm going to stop now.
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:50.560]   You ended up asking the questions that I was thinking about asking.
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.280]   I feel good.
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.680]   I think I understand what you're going for.
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:58.600]   I'm actually excited about the process that you're going to go through with Apple over
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:03.280]   the next few months because I'm not saying that Apple made promises to you, but let's
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:08.440]   just say Apple made some promises to you and you're not going to budge and that means that
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:12.120]   they're going to have to figure out how to make this work for you, which is you're basically
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:17.840]   the trailblazer for other developers who have left the App Store.
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:24.840]   Our experience with Apple right now is going to be just whatever, would all other app developers
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:29.160]   for Mac apps are going to kind of look to to decide whether or not this is something
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.320]   they're willing to go through.
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.440]   So it's going to be an exciting process.
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.960]   Do you blog about the process?
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:37.400]   Of course, I know there's some things you have to keep secret.
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:43.600]   I don't generally write online terribly much and indeed you're right.
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:49.760]   There are things that we can't talk about, stuff that is either up in the air or unreleased
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:57.080]   in the OS and they have, their NDAs are very interesting.
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.760]   You mentioned my ears burning.
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:05.040]   It turns out that if you even think about talking about certain aspects that might be
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:09.120]   covered by the NDAs, your ears start burning.
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.360]   How are your ears right now?
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:11.360]   Are they okay?
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.360]   Yeah.
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:19.680]   There's a great deal that I can't talk about, but it's not dark stuff.
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:26.680]   It's more a matter of work that is ongoing and that they would prefer to discuss, disclose
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.160]   themselves once the job is done.
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:33.280]   I'm just glad to see the reunification of the north and the south and the denuclearization
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:34.960]   of this relationship.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:37.640]   I think it's a good thing all around.
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:38.640]   I agree.
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.640]   Yes, some of my favorites.
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.960]   Some of my favorite apps come from the App Store.
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.800]   Don't come from the App Store.
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:48.040]   Well, there's a huge convenience with the App Store, right?
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.800]   So you get a new app store?
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:50.800]   Absolutely.
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:51.800]   Absolutely.
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:57.160]   When the Mac App Store came out, I think 2011, I was so excited.
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:03.200]   This was going to be the greatest thing and it just was kind of meh and the best apps.
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:06.120]   No offense to all the people who have apps in the App Store because there's a lot of
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:07.120]   amazing ones.
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:12.400]   But some of my favorites you can't get in the Mac App Store and the interface of the Mac
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:16.800]   App Store is also just kind of not very interesting and not easy to discover.
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:23.400]   So this whole thing is actually a wonderful thing for consumers of Mac apps as well as
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.360]   developers of Mac apps.
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:30.480]   I just like what it says about that.
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:37.480]   It would have been disappointing if both panic and bare bones had left the Mac App Store
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:40.960]   and just simply went their separate ways.
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:44.960]   When I heard about panic and BB out of coming back to the App Store, it really made me happy
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:50.160]   because I imagined it meant that it wasn't like Apple said, "Great, here's your hat."
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:51.160]   Go to hell.
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:52.160]   Fine.
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.840]   Go and go and stay with outside the App Store.
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:58.760]   The fact that they came back meant that there must have, I felt as though there must have
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:01.960]   been ongoing changes at the App Store.
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:11.600]   We hear a lot about how the new management of the App Store seems to be more open to solving
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:16.320]   problems as opposed to just dropping a rulebook and walking off from it.
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:22.120]   So it's good to see vibrancy and change happen in a positive way.
[00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:26.480]   I guess one other feature that maybe is important to you, the subscription, I mean,
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:30.600]   are there other features of the App Store we think are going to be changing maybe demos?
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.680]   I don't know, maybe subscription features, things like that.
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:39.120]   Are there other features rich that you're happy to see that will be beneficial to you?
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:45.800]   Well, I think the biggest one is what Lori touched on before in which the visibility
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:53.000]   is the interface in the App Store is improving the visibility of products and the discoverability
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:00.520]   of products is it looks like it's going to get on par with the iOS App Store.
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:04.600]   It looks like the same ideas are coming across from iOS.
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:07.560]   And I think for us, that's going to be really great.
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:14.160]   Just the ability for people to find the product organically on their own without being pointed
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.360]   at it is going to be pretty big for us.
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.320]   I can see the Bruno agrees with you.
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.320]   Indeed, yes.
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.920]   Can we talk about the parrot in the room here?
[00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:27.120]   Sorry about that interruption.
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:29.120]   Oh, we love for it.
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.640]   He's very determined.
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:32.440]   Is he molting?
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:34.920]   He's a little bit of a picker.
[00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:35.920]   Uh-oh.
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.320]   He's actually, believe it or not, in the process of regrowing.
[00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:44.720]   You've got to get some little beak mitten to keep him from picking at him.
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:49.800]   Yeah, the TransLink guys, panic software said that they're going to do subscription on
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:54.000]   the App Store an outright purchase on the web.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.120]   Have you looked at something like that?
[00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:00.760]   So we're looking into the options and we haven't made any final decisions and we're
[00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:05.600]   going to be announcing all of that as soon as we actually have something ready to ship.
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:12.280]   So yeah, as far as the business side of it, that is an important piece of it is we can
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:18.600]   look at this now and say, okay, there's a viable ongoing business model here.
[00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:21.920]   Let's figure out how to fit it into what we have.
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:28.240]   So yeah, nothing for us to announce yet, but as soon as we have software ready to ship,
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:33.600]   we'll be talking about pricing and licensing models and that sort of thing.
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:34.600]   And I think it's great.
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:40.880]   I do have large specific applications that I use that are not in the App Store, but probably
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:44.640]   95% of what I use at this point is all in the App Store.
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:48.200]   It's just when I get a new computer or I go to another computer and I need to pull something
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:52.440]   down, that becomes the thing that is just super useful.
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:54.960]   My trepidation is about the App Store.
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:58.600]   Mostly I've been laid to rest, which was that Apple was eventually going to require everything
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:01.760]   be sold through the App Store.
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:08.320]   And I was really worried that I would no longer be able to put arbitrary software on my Macintosh.
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:11.640]   I mean, I like the idea that for most people they can say, I'm going to use only the App
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:17.440]   Store, turn, make gatekeepers say only App Store apps and be more secure, have more trusted
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.440]   apps.
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:23.760]   But for me, the reason I have a computer as opposed to an iPad is I want to be able to
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:28.120]   install whatever the hell I want to install on there.
[00:20:28.120 --> 00:20:34.240]   And so I was worried they have talked a little bit about changing the gatekeeper rules and
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:36.320]   requiring a certificate.
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.960]   Is that right, Rich?
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:46.000]   There are some developments that are ongoing for Mojave.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.280]   I don't remember what they spoke about, what they've disclosed publicly about notarized
[00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:52.280]   applications.
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:54.280]   Notarized, that's the word.
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:21:01.040]   And that's a slightly different model from the usual code signing.
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:06.160]   Prefacing what I'm about to say with this is pure conjecture on my part.
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:12.160]   I can imagine a day in the future and I don't think it's this year, it might not even be
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:14.920]   next year.
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:21.480]   I don't know when, but I can imagine a time when Mac OS by default won't run anything
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:25.440]   that isn't signed in some way.
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:31.760]   Either you have built it yourself with a valid developer certificate and those are easy to
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:37.560]   get from Apple or you've downloaded it and you're using a trusted developer ID or notarized
[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:41.640]   application or it came from the App Store.
[00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:47.880]   Now in the state of the union talk which we did not broadcast and I did not watch, they
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.560]   did talk specifically about this.
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:54.320]   So you're not speaking out of school when you say this, this was public knowledge.
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:22:00.400]   It said that apps will need express user consent for all API and direct access to things
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:05.320]   like mail database, message history, Safari data, time machine backups, iTunes device
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:09.600]   backups, locations or routine system cookies, microphone, camera.
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:11.160]   That all makes sense.
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.440]   That's a good security model.
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:19.600]   As long as it doesn't keep third party developers like you from offering full powered programs
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:23.680]   without Apple's express written consent.
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:30.640]   Well, I think the sort of the national conclusion here is that as part of an ongoing process
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:35.960]   and I'd say beginning with 1014, Apple has gotten the technology to the point where they
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:45.000]   can make sandboxing and security restrictions generally work in such a way that you can
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.880]   ship a product, we can ship a product that satisfies their security requirements and
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:54.840]   satisfies our requirements to produce a full product experience.
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:58.960]   So, you know, and we're pretty low level tool.
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:05.920]   There are others that are even lower level things like super duper.
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:14.680]   And I think that Apple realizes the need to still support a rich software ecosystem.
[00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:19.360]   They can't simply deny certain classes of product just because they don't fit cleanly
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:21.200]   into a security model.
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:25.360]   They've got to figure out how to make the security model work for everybody.
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:31.160]   So, the notarization thing you mentioned, Apple said, will be purely a malware scan.
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:35.760]   They're not going to review the app another way, but they're going to malware scan it
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:37.520]   before it gets notarized.
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:41.800]   And you won't be able, the presumption is you won't be able on Mojave.
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:45.240]   Maybe you'll be able to jump through hoops and install non-notarized apps or maybe not.
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:48.200]   But the Mojave will really kind of require notarized apps.
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:53.440]   I don't think that's a onerous as long as they do that and they don't start scanning for,
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.320]   you know, I mean, it depends what they call "majestic."
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:58.000]   Now, malware is a Bitcoin miner malware.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.080]   I don't know.
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:00.080]   Yeah.
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:03.900]   So long as I listen, I'm sorry to go ahead, Andy.
[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:07.640]   I was just going to say, I have no problem with it so long as people still have the ability
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:12.660]   to write whatever, write and publish whatever damn app they want without it being approved
[00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:14.680]   by Apple in some fashion.
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:22.200]   The more I talk to people about notarization, it's less about control of the content and
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:28.120]   more about just the idea of if there is something bad out there, Apple wants to have the ability
[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:31.400]   to basically pull that app from being able to be run.
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:36.640]   So so long as that really is the thing, so long as someone can write the most offensive,
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:42.560]   horrible, problematic app that doesn't actually interfere with the operation of the user's
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:47.320]   computer or anybody else's, so long as there's still that ability, I'm fine with it.
[00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:51.680]   But Lea really touches on something here when he talks about Bitcoin mining.
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:56.800]   If, for example, how does Apple define malware?
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:01.920]   There's a lot of, I don't know how Bitcoin mining works really, but I'm sure there's
[00:25:01.920 --> 00:25:04.920]   a lot of people out there who have that installed on their computers.
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:12.320]   And if Apple actually makes it so that that gets pulled off your Mac, how is that going
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:13.320]   to be addressed?
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:23.560]   So there's something to be considered when you think about this notarizing, notarization,
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:25.000]   did I say that right?
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.280]   Notarization of Mac apps.
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:32.080]   Yeah, so what would you just have to wait and see?
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.520]   I mean, I was relieved.
[00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:37.640]   That was my whole fear with a Mac app store and I was relieved that that didn't have that
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:42.720]   and Rich was able to sell BB edit through his website direct and continue to do so.
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:46.880]   Rich, would you prefer people buy, okay, now here's a loaded question.
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:48.400]   You can defer this if you want.
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:54.040]   Would you prefer people buy it direct from you?
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:59.400]   In some ways, yes, because we like to know who our customers are.
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:05.440]   A big part of our way of business for the past 25 years is to have built a strong and
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:13.240]   ongoing relationship with the customer and buying direct from us helps us do that.
[00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:19.080]   On the other hand, we've always tried to support the customer having whatever choices
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:20.920]   they want to have.
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:27.200]   And so if it suits the customer to buy from the Mac app store, they're still our customer.
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.200]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.520]   We're going to treat them just the same.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:36.960]   So if I want to balance it off, it's really hard to say.
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.120]   They're pros and cons.
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:44.640]   Are the benefits of the app store outweigh the 30% cut?
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:47.400]   Again some ways, yes, again some ways, no.
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:53.840]   I think the biggest benefit is that for a certain range of our customers, the app store installation
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:27:01.400]   experience is just so frictionless for those customers, it eliminates any tech support
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:04.400]   questions about installation or update because it just happens.
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.080]   So that saves you money right there.
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:08.560]   In a sense, yeah.
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:12.080]   And when I download it from the app store, I'm downloading it from Apple through their
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:15.440]   Akamai network, not from you at all.
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:16.520]   That's correct.
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:19.960]   And how has it been for, well, you don't know yet.
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:21.960]   I'll have to ask somebody else.
[00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:28.280]   Some people, some developers have complained about, certainly on iOS, about the difficulty
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.960]   of the gatekeeping slows down the update process.
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:33.640]   Are you concerned at all about that?
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:35.760]   Not as much as we used to be.
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:43.320]   From what I've seen lately, the experience of a few other folks that I'm friends with,
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:47.960]   app review, turn times are down to a day or less.
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:48.960]   Good.
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:53.960]   And so that sort of fits with our own process pretty well.
[00:27:53.960 --> 00:28:00.840]   When there's a deterministic amount of time for app review and it's a very short deterministic
[00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:07.760]   amount of time, that makes it much, much easier for us to plan our update release timing.
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:09.080]   Very good.
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:13.240]   Any other questions for Mr. Segal or can we let him get back to work on BB Edd?
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:16.360]   Get to work, great.
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:18.040]   I'm sure there's a fine.
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:19.040]   How's your driving?
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:23.720]   Have you burned through this new set of tires yet?
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:33.080]   Almost the rear tires are down to the second set of wear bars and the fronts might need
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:35.160]   replacement by the end of the season.
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:40.880]   Last time, fortunately, fortunately there are my autocross stickies, my regular street tires
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:41.880]   the last three years.
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:45.880]   Last time, Richard Zahn, didn't you recommend some sort of device for pulling the engine
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:48.080]   or something, lifting your car off the ground?
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:49.080]   I can't remember.
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:51.040]   Oh, you know, I think I did.
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:52.520]   I think it was the jack points.
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:53.520]   Yep.
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:54.520]   Yep.
[00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:55.520]   Still use them.
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:56.520]   They're still awesome.
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:29:02.360]   Richard, you're the greatest and I love bare bones edit and I will continue to buy BB
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:05.080]   Edd as long as you continue to update it.
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:06.800]   Version 12 is the current version.
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:08.520]   I just got to copy you.
[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:11.560]   You go Jimbo, your database program.
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:12.560]   Just keep up the good work.
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:13.560]   I really appreciate it.
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:14.560]   All you're doing.
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:21.240]   Are you considering shifting the code base to Swift at any point?
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:24.640]   Not in the sense of, am I going to sit down and start rewriting everything?
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:27.960]   I think the answer to that is no.
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:34.520]   For us right now, Objective C and Objective C++ are good tools for all we need.
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:39.360]   Some day I'll pick up Swift and start writing new code and start fitting that into what
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:40.360]   we have.
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:47.160]   BB Edd is the second program I install on every Mac.
[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:50.000]   Of course that begs the question.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.720]   Well, I'll put last pet us on first.
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:53.560]   I think the lock finder is there.
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:54.560]   Finders there.
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:56.120]   Yeah, I finders there.
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:30:01.040]   Probably Chrome is Chrome in LastPass and the U luck origin in the next step and then
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:02.560]   I download BB Edd.
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:03.560]   Thank you Rich Siegel.
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:04.560]   We really appreciate it.
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:05.560]   Thanks for having me.
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:06.560]   It's been a blast.
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:07.560]   So good.
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:10.320]   Well, it's great to get the inside story to barebones.com.
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:11.320]   Go buy BB Edd.
[00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:15.200]   At least download the trial at Siegel on the Twitter.
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.200]   Take care Rich.
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:17.200]   Thanks.
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.200]   We'll take a break.
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.480]   There's still lots to talk about and we have a great panel.
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:25.040]   Thank you for letting me guys monopolize Rich a little bit and the Enoco Alex Lindsey,
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:26.700]   Lori Gill.
[00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:32.360]   Our show is timely because you may be looking at a new phone soon and I just want to let
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:35.840]   you know what to do with the old phone when that time comes.
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:39.280]   Trade in your old device for a great price at Gazelle.
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:42.560]   You know by now I've been talking about Gazelle for years.
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:47.080]   Gazelle.com accepts Samsung Galaxy S9 iPhone 8.
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:49.200]   Yes, you can trade it in an iPhone 10.
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:55.320]   I know more than a few people who have traded in the iPhone 10 because they wanted the fingerprint
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:58.840]   reader and they wanted a headphone jack, right?
[00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:01.480]   And they've gone back to the iPhone 7.
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:02.480]   You could actually do that.
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:03.480]   I've heard of people like that.
[00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:05.000]   I've heard of people like that.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.280]   Gazelle is the place.
[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:10.000]   If you're looking to buy a certified pre-owned device, they have an incredible selection.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   iPhone 6 through 10 for iPads, they've got standard air, mini and pro models for laptops,
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.400]   MacBook Air and the pro selection.
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:26.280]   They even cater to Android users with a variety of Samsung Galaxy phones and every device
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:27.960]   fully inspected.
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:32.600]   They have a 30-point check list of things, inspection that they go through to make sure
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:34.600]   everything's in working order.
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:38.560]   They're saying, of course, functional, but also whether they're scratches.
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:44.000]   You can choose your device at good, fair or excellent condition and the price matches.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   If you don't mind a little gentle wear and tear, especially if you're replacing a used
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.360]   device, maybe you lost your phone or broke, that's a great way to save money and it works
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:54.360]   fully.
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:56.160]   It's just, it looks like it's been gently used.
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:57.960]   That's fine, right?
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:02.400]   Everything works for all the major carriers, AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint, you can
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:06.920]   get unlocked devices there as well, but of course, as always, everything you get was
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:09.040]   sold without a carrier contract.
[00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:11.120]   And you can get financing with a firm.
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:14.680]   Just provide your basic information and you'll get instantly approved.
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:17.200]   You can pay off in three, six or 12 months.
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:20.720]   Easy monthly payments can be made through bank transfer check or debit card.
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:26.080]   All you got to do is as you're checking out, just click the boxes as financing with a firm,
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:30.080]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com.
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:35.560]   So to buy or to sell, it's always gazelle, right?
[00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:39.720]   Give new life to use devices, trade it in for cash or buy a certified pre-owned device
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:43.400]   or do both, which I think is what a lot of people do.
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:45.320]   Trade in the iPhone 10 and get an iPhone 7.
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:47.280]   You could do it all at gazelle.
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:52.160]   gazelle.com, you'll get started today and you don't have to say we always, because we
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:55.640]   go through a lot of devices, we always sell with it gazelle.
[00:32:55.640 --> 00:33:00.480]   And I'm always impressed by the quality of the service we get from them and it's not
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:05.280]   unusual for them to say, "Oh, we quoted you $30, it's worth $40."
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:07.520]   Very frequently that happens, which is nice.
[00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:09.000]   They don't have to do that, but they do.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:15.760]   gazelle.com, we're thanking for their longtime support of Mac Break Weekly.
[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:16.760]   Okay.
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:19.120]   We're done.
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:23.840]   I am really glad we could get rich on because I was really interested when Apple, I was
[00:33:23.840 --> 00:33:28.040]   sitting here and Apple said, "And panic software is transmitted and bare bones, BB
[00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:29.840]   edit will be on the app store."
[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:30.840]   I was like stunned.
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:33.080]   You're looking at flying pigs weren't you?
[00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:34.080]   Yeah.
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:36.800]   It's like, "What?"
[00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:40.760]   One of the reasons why I love that is that we all love bare bones software.
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:44.280]   We all love rich and everybody else at bare bones.
[00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:49.680]   And the fact that Apple decided, it's very, very telling that Apple decided that it will
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:54.000]   look, we will look very, very good in front of these 6,000 developers if we say that
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.040]   panics and bare bones are rejoining the app store.
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.440]   So it wasn't like, "Oh, isn't it?"
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:33:59.800]   It's not only, "Oh, that's nice.
[00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:01.000]   What a nice thing for bare bones."
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.360]   But it's like the fact that the stature of the developers of panics and the stature
[00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:11.240]   of the developers of bare bones, that 6,000 developers are saying, "Oh, I guess things
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:15.740]   must be on an up curve at the app store if these folks who not only pulled out of the
[00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:21.180]   app store, but left behind blog posts that's stated in very, very simple, rational and
[00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:24.020]   helpful ways, there are reasons behind it.
[00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:25.940]   That's a good sign for everybody.
[00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:29.420]   You know, I forgot to ask him the most important question.
[00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:31.620]   If he's going to support dark mode.
[00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:34.100]   I bet he is.
[00:34:34.100 --> 00:34:35.100]   Got it.
[00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:37.060]   Alex, are you like, "Over the moon, we all speculated that Alex?"
[00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:39.900]   I said, "Dark mode is for Alex Lindsey and his comments."
[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:40.900]   Yeah, they're like, "You can turn it off."
[00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:42.700]   And I'm like, "Why would you ever do that?"
[00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:51.020]   Photographers want that 30, what is it, 20, 30 percent gray background because that's
[00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:52.460]   how you'd photo at it, right?
[00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:55.060]   Well, color pops out much better when everything's dark and gray.
[00:34:55.060 --> 00:35:01.020]   And so, especially if you're more image driven, it allows you to see what you're doing a
[00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:02.020]   lot better.
[00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:04.180]   So, almost every professional app goes dark gray.
[00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:06.180]   You know, it has been dark gray for a long time.
[00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:09.500]   And I mean, literally our whole office is all medium gray.
[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:11.460]   It's not dark gray, but it's gray every morning.
[00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:13.460]   30 percent, 20 percent, 18 percent.
[00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:17.980]   Literally, we take an 18 percent gray card and we hand it to the person painting and
[00:35:17.980 --> 00:35:19.660]   just go just match that card.
[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:23.820]   And so everything, you can literally call it correct your cameras to the wall.
[00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:24.820]   That's cool.
[00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:25.820]   That's cool.
[00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:26.820]   Actually.
[00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:29.220]   But yeah, yeah, so it's all gray.
[00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:32.180]   But taking that color out makes it much easier.
[00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:37.820]   When you have that background, your colors pop and when it's gray, it's going to be more
[00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:38.820]   accurate.
[00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:41.020]   It's a lot easier for your eyes.
[00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:42.020]   And it looks cooler.
[00:35:42.020 --> 00:35:43.020]   It's just clear.
[00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:44.020]   Yeah.
[00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:45.260]   You know, it just looks nicer.
[00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:48.780]   You feel like there's a reason why you're billing by the hour as much as you're billing
[00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:49.780]   by the hour.
[00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:50.980]   If your app is in a dark mode.
[00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:51.980]   Yes.
[00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:57.940]   What do you think about the photo editing capabilities they've actually put in the finder
[00:35:57.940 --> 00:35:58.940]   now?
[00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:00.700]   I mean, I know that you need something more.
[00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:01.780]   I need something more.
[00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:04.700]   But just the ability to say crop an image.
[00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:05.940]   I think it's huge.
[00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:10.260]   I think it's, you know, the, there's so many things that you're doing that are these really
[00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:12.380]   quick things that you have to do.
[00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:13.340]   Oh, I didn't crop this.
[00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:17.700]   I need to, I need to do, you know, file conversion.
[00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:21.260]   I need to do all these other things or things that you want to be able to do in the finder.
[00:36:21.260 --> 00:36:24.900]   You don't want to have to go out to whether it's pixel mader or Photoshop.
[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:27.900]   I mean, and then the thing we probably have to do more often than anything else is rescale
[00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:28.900]   or crop.
[00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:31.700]   You know, those are the, those are the probably the most common things you want to do with
[00:36:31.700 --> 00:36:33.020]   a photo.
[00:36:33.020 --> 00:36:37.140]   I want to get, we're going to try to get Sal Sequoian on a triangulation very soon.
[00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:41.460]   I sent a note to his wife Naomi, both to ask about your jimbo.
[00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:42.460]   Right.
[00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:43.460]   Yeah.
[00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:48.780]   But also I said, so is Sal like thrilled about the automation features they're building into
[00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:53.500]   iOS or is he feeling like, wow.
[00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:57.980]   And I, you know, we'll get him on to talk about it.
[00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:01.140]   And I'm sure he'll be judicious.
[00:37:01.140 --> 00:37:07.740]   But the sense I got was the difference is it was the Mac OS people who Sal was working
[00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:12.180]   for and they decided automation wasn't cool.
[00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:16.740]   The iOS kids now have decided the automation is cool.
[00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:19.980]   And it's just that there was a wall between the two groups.
[00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:22.540]   And that happens in companies often.
[00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:23.540]   Always.
[00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:26.780]   You have two different, you know, something can go away one place and pop up the other.
[00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:31.220]   This is one of those things they preface by saying I have no specific inside information
[00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:33.100]   and I want to stress that.
[00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:40.740]   But my impression has usually been that there really is like a there really is like if something
[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:42.780]   is an iOS idea, it's wonderful.
[00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:46.580]   If something is a Mac OS idea, okay, it's fine.
[00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:51.740]   And basically that anything that makes iOS more triumphant, anything that makes it more
[00:37:51.740 --> 00:37:55.420]   practical, more useful, more professional is a high priority.
[00:37:55.420 --> 00:38:01.740]   Whereas it's hard to figure out how to market an automation feature in the Mac because if
[00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:05.540]   if it's someone is going to take advantage of that feature, they already know it exists
[00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:07.100]   and it's not going to affect the sale.
[00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:14.740]   Whereas the ability to take to get an IT department to start shipping out Mac book, excuse me,
[00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:20.460]   iPad pros to its workers in the field as opposed to with Windows, Windows notebooks.
[00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:22.220]   That's a really, really big deal.
[00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:23.220]   Yeah.
[00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:27.580]   Laurie, you went to both Google I/O and WWDC.
[00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:30.740]   You've had some time to think about both.
[00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:31.740]   Yeah.
[00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:33.580]   I think you have some thoughts.
[00:38:33.580 --> 00:38:38.700]   Well, you know, I mean, we can do some generals and we can do some specifics.
[00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:46.980]   So in general, I love the way both presents.
[00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:52.540]   They're both pretty fantastic and get your blood boiling, get you super excited about
[00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:55.580]   things to come in the future.
[00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:56.580]   They look great.
[00:38:56.580 --> 00:39:03.660]   There's lots of wonderful people, lots of wonderful developers at both.
[00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:12.140]   At the Apple Conference at WWDC, I've noticed a lot more developers who are engaging and
[00:39:12.140 --> 00:39:16.660]   just sort of just talking to each other and kind of networking with each other as opposed
[00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:21.580]   to kind of hanging out amongst themselves a little bit just in a personal level.
[00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:24.940]   And this was just from my personal experience.
[00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:28.020]   I did want to speak specifically to AR.
[00:39:28.020 --> 00:39:32.580]   Apple's new AR feature, if we're ready to talk about that now, which is...
[00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:33.580]   Yeah.
[00:39:33.580 --> 00:39:35.340]   So we played this funny...
[00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:36.340]   We are on iOS today.
[00:39:36.340 --> 00:39:43.620]   We did a whole seg iOS today on what features in iOS 12 could you do right now on iOS 11
[00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:45.220]   through third-party apps?
[00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:48.660]   And one of them, I actually have already deleted it because I don't want to ever play it again.
[00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:51.820]   But one of them was called Heroes Hero.
[00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:52.820]   What was it called?
[00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:53.820]   I can't remember.
[00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:57.620]   But we played it and it had the problem.
[00:39:57.620 --> 00:40:03.380]   I think that all AR apps are going to have when they're using the back camera.
[00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:04.380]   It's very hard.
[00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:07.980]   If you use a front camera app, Apple's made that for augmented reality.
[00:40:07.980 --> 00:40:09.500]   It's got depth sensors.
[00:40:09.500 --> 00:40:12.620]   It's got the point scanning, the face scanning.
[00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:15.780]   All of those things that really help AR be accurate.
[00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:18.140]   None of that stuff is on the back.
[00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:20.980]   You've got the two lenses.
[00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:22.380]   Do they use both lenses for that?
[00:40:22.380 --> 00:40:24.220]   I do believe that they use both lenses for that.
[00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:25.220]   Absolutely.
[00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:29.340]   And then the other thing is that you also, I have to admit, I probably have less...
[00:40:29.340 --> 00:40:32.980]   Because I've been photogrammetry for 20 years, I have less problems with the AR than most
[00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:34.900]   people because I realize I naturally do certain things.
[00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:35.900]   You know what...
[00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:36.900]   Well, I naturally...
[00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:37.900]   I naturally start...
[00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:40.340]   I move my camera a lot rather than...
[00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:44.020]   So when you rotate your camera like this, it's really hard to figure out what the 3D speed
[00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:45.020]   is.
[00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:48.100]   If you move your hand like this, what it's doing is it's looking at all these people.
[00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:49.100]   It's going to be a few points.
[00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:50.400]   And then it says, "What's the...
[00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:53.300]   It looks at the speed at which those points are moving."
[00:40:53.300 --> 00:40:54.860]   And that's how it figures out what the 3D is.
[00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:59.660]   And 3D tracking, 3D match moving has been doing that for 20 years.
[00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:02.980]   And so that technology is not new.
[00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:07.860]   Now the advantage that the phone has is that it has an accelerometer that is a cheat sheet.
[00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:08.860]   So I know where you are.
[00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:09.860]   I know where you're pointed.
[00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:11.420]   I know a bunch of things about that.
[00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:12.420]   So that cheat sheet...
[00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:13.420]   Oh, the accelerometer.
[00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:14.420]   Yeah.
[00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:16.540]   So it says, "Okay, I know that you're rotating."
[00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:19.540]   And then it makes it easier for it to get close.
[00:41:19.540 --> 00:41:25.580]   And then it uses the feature tracking, which again has been around in 2D for 25 years and
[00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:28.140]   3D in the last 20 years.
[00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:34.540]   But it grabs onto that and is able to generate 3D...
[00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:36.740]   We would call a sparse cloud.
[00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:38.300]   So it just grabs a couple points.
[00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:41.540]   So it has sufficient hardware to do a good job with it.
[00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:42.540]   It has...
[00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:43.540]   Yeah, the phone laser is better.
[00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:44.540]   I mean, Tango is...
[00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:46.500]   You're showing with the iPad though, right, Laurie?
[00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:47.500]   That's what they were playing that slush.
[00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:48.500]   Absolutely.
[00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:49.500]   It can definitely do it.
[00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:50.500]   It can do it with one lens.
[00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:51.500]   It can do it with two lenses.
[00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:52.500]   It can do it with those things.
[00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:54.500]   Tango, for instance, is still way better.
[00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:55.540]   Because it has all this fun.
[00:41:55.540 --> 00:41:56.620]   Because it has the laser...
[00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:57.620]   It has a laser.
[00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:58.620]   But it is...
[00:41:58.620 --> 00:42:01.740]   Now the problem with it is it lasts about 10 minutes before you run out of battery.
[00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:04.340]   But it's a much more accurate.
[00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:07.700]   It'll lock better than what you get with the iPhone.
[00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:12.260]   But that's a good example of Google doing the right way to do it.
[00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:14.700]   Then nobody bought it because it supported it so they could have supported it.
[00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:15.700]   Google didn't support it.
[00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:17.700]   Google didn't put it in their own phone.
[00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:18.700]   You know, like...
[00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:22.660]   Because it would cost a lot more.
[00:42:22.660 --> 00:42:27.420]   So anyway, Google watched ARKit, watched Apple's success with ARKit and said, "Oh crap."
[00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:31.500]   And they abandoned Tango and said, "All right, we got ARCore," which is basically Google's
[00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:33.500]   Android version of ARKit.
[00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:35.380]   So Laurie, did you get to play this thingshot game?
[00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:36.940]   Renee, I saw Renee playing it.
[00:42:36.940 --> 00:42:38.340]   Renee have played this screenshot game.
[00:42:38.340 --> 00:42:40.700]   I haven't had a chance to play it, but I saw some pictures.
[00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:42.180]   I get an idea.
[00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:48.780]   And here's where my anti-Apple comes in, if you will.
[00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:49.780]   Google's doing it right.
[00:42:49.780 --> 00:42:52.940]   So this is the new feature that's coming in Mac...
[00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:54.740]   Sorry, iOS 12.
[00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:58.700]   You're going to be able to play an AR game with another person.
[00:42:58.700 --> 00:43:00.700]   So I'm on one side of a table.
[00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:02.180]   You're on another side of a table.
[00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:04.100]   And let's say it's ping-pong.
[00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:06.340]   You can play ping-pong in AR with the other person.
[00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:08.300]   And it uses the thing called anchors.
[00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:16.620]   So one iPhone is sort of the host of this game and sends this information off to the
[00:43:16.620 --> 00:43:19.220]   game and creates an anchor.
[00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:23.740]   And then that information is sent to the other person's phone, which then becomes the receiver
[00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:26.780]   of that information and the receiver of the anchor.
[00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:28.380]   So they're tied together.
[00:43:28.380 --> 00:43:32.980]   So it makes it so that two iPhones can play this game in the same room together as if
[00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:38.660]   they were playing a console game or something like that.
[00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:43.420]   Where Google and Apple have similar processes.
[00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:47.060]   Where Google is doing it right is that they made this cross device.
[00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:48.740]   You can do the same thing on an iPhone.
[00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:51.140]   You can do the same thing on an Android phone.
[00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:55.340]   And Apple has shut this down to only on iPhones.
[00:43:55.340 --> 00:43:56.340]   I think that's a big mistake.
[00:43:56.340 --> 00:44:03.540]   I think being able to play cross-platform with Android and iOS is brilliant.
[00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:10.220]   And it bums me out that Apple decided to keep this localized on iOS only.
[00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:14.340]   And I know I understand all security issues and things like that.
[00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:19.900]   But we can already do it with games that are developed from Google.
[00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:26.900]   And Google has an app right now, which whose name escapes me right now, but it's a handwriting
[00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:31.740]   game where you write in the air.
[00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:35.580]   And you can use that on your iPhone and you can use that on an Android phone.
[00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:39.860]   So Apple didn't lock Google out from being able to do this on iPhones.
[00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:43.100]   So they are saying, we think it's cool, go ahead and do it.
[00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:46.340]   But in the reverse, Apple didn't do the same thing.
[00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:53.220]   They're not making it so that Android phones have access to ARKit or ARKit games.
[00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:54.740]   I think that's a mistake.
[00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:56.700]   I don't think it's a...
[00:44:56.700 --> 00:45:04.420]   As someone who's developed on both, let's say, not Android, but Windows and Apple products,
[00:45:04.420 --> 00:45:10.900]   our experience when we were writing code for it was that the other operating system, whatever
[00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:13.180]   your other operating system is, was just an enormous amount of work.
[00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:19.220]   In our case, 90% of our support was supporting the Windows platform more than 90% was supporting
[00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:22.460]   the Windows platform, but it was 10% of our sales.
[00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:23.700]   And so we killed it.
[00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:24.900]   We just killed the Windows side.
[00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:28.300]   And it didn't have to do with the fact that we're Big Mac guys or whatever.
[00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:29.900]   We thought we'd sell a lot more on Windows.
[00:45:29.900 --> 00:45:32.740]   That's why we built a Windows version.
[00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:36.380]   But the issue is that it was just more work.
[00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:38.020]   And it wasn't panning out.
[00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:42.500]   And it allowed us to innovate faster because then once you stop writing for both platforms,
[00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:45.660]   you just start using the libraries that you have available to you.
[00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:46.900]   And everything moves faster.
[00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:51.340]   And I think that Apple's approach to this is less of a business one and more of a...
[00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:53.020]   Just that it's faster.
[00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:54.460]   They can innovate faster.
[00:45:54.460 --> 00:45:56.940]   They can put more features in because they own the hardware and the software.
[00:45:56.940 --> 00:46:00.300]   They don't have to figure out how they're going to jack this up inside of an Android
[00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:03.340]   thing rather than Google needs to do it.
[00:46:03.340 --> 00:46:04.340]   Apple doesn't.
[00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:05.340]   It's kind of...
[00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:06.340]   You know, and Apple...
[00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:07.340]   And Apple...
[00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:11.140]   Apple had this for Windows because it was a minority operating system and Windows...
[00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:12.140]   And it's still a minority.
[00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:15.300]   It's still a minority operating system, but it's minority is so big.
[00:46:15.300 --> 00:46:17.060]   It feels like the way...
[00:46:17.060 --> 00:46:18.060]   And I don't...
[00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:20.820]   You may be for good technical reasons and maybe for commercial reasons.
[00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:22.620]   I think it happens to be both or...
[00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:24.620]   I think it's almost all just...
[00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:27.500]   They just want to be able to move faster and they can move faster with...
[00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:31.180]   It feels like the people of Apple just don't think anybody has anything but Apple.
[00:46:31.180 --> 00:46:32.740]   No, they just don't care.
[00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:33.740]   Well, they don't...
[00:46:33.740 --> 00:46:36.940]   I think that they have a...
[00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:40.660]   They have an idea of the world that works just great for them and works great for their
[00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:41.660]   customers too.
[00:46:41.660 --> 00:46:47.020]   They're not responsible for changing the entire world and making the AR experience better
[00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:48.020]   for everybody.
[00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:49.020]   They...
[00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:50.020]   Whereas...
[00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:51.620]   And it's partly due to business models.
[00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:56.180]   I think it's also part due to corporate philosophies between Google and Apple.
[00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:57.660]   Google is like, "No, I should...
[00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:00.420]   If it's possible for us to make this work for everybody, we're going to make this work
[00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:01.420]   for everybody."
[00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:02.660]   Again, it's business and philosophy.
[00:47:02.660 --> 00:47:07.500]   Apple says, "We can make the very best version of this and we can keep iterating and improving
[00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:11.620]   it really, really fast if we make sure it's just running on our own hardware."
[00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:16.900]   We can optimize the operating system and the hardware in this feature and also the APIs
[00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:21.220]   to work together so well that if we were trying to make sure this worked on the Samsung
[00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:27.260]   Galaxy S6 as well, we can't create a really great experience for that.
[00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:32.060]   So I'm not going to ding them for that.
[00:47:32.060 --> 00:47:34.660]   I wish that they would do more things that were multi-platform.
[00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:39.860]   But particularly when it comes to AR, this is something where you can create the best
[00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:45.660]   possible experience by getting every single CPU cycle and every single screen cycle and
[00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:47.380]   making it the best it could possibly be.
[00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:52.140]   When I'm seeing how quickly developers were grabbing onto the AR kit improvements where
[00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:54.340]   just things like...
[00:47:54.340 --> 00:48:00.140]   It looked like big screen Hollywood special effects the way that AR kit was tracking an
[00:48:00.140 --> 00:48:03.020]   object and just simply annotating.
[00:48:03.020 --> 00:48:07.660]   Here's a box and an arrow pointing at something saying, "Here is the thing that you need to
[00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:12.740]   pick up next or here is background on this piece of paper, the information that's on
[00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:14.100]   the sheet of paper."
[00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:17.580]   That's such a wonderful, smooth thing that...
[00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:19.500]   I would love to see...
[00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:25.540]   It will help everybody else in that everybody will see how good AR can be and try to match
[00:48:25.540 --> 00:48:27.980]   the performance of what Apple is doing.
[00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:30.740]   The thing is, it's also not bidirectional.
[00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:34.900]   So the amount of work that Google has to do to get everything working on every Android
[00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:39.020]   phone is a huge lift and adding the iPhone is a little lift.
[00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:40.940]   The amount Apple has to do to...
[00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:45.820]   They have making it work on the iPhone is a small lift, making it available for 27 different
[00:48:45.820 --> 00:48:50.060]   platforms and there's only 6% of the installed base that has the newest operating system.
[00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:55.500]   All that's a much harder lift for Apple than it is for Google.
[00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:56.900]   Google's adding one more phone.
[00:48:56.900 --> 00:49:07.180]   Apple is adding this cacophony of hardware and software.
[00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:15.380]   I'm a big fan of interoperability and open, but I also recognize that Apple's philosophy
[00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:20.180]   is working for them and I think you're right, it does make a better product.
[00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:21.180]   Why dilute it?
[00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:25.740]   For instance, I never launch Apple Music on my Android phone.
[00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:26.740]   I'm not tempted to.
[00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:29.860]   I have a subscription I'm just not tempted to.
[00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:33.700]   So I understand what you're saying, Laurie, and I agree with you.
[00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:34.900]   And the trouble that a lot of people are going to have.
[00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:37.340]   You got to acknowledge this works for Apple.
[00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:42.860]   Absolutely, but from the consumer perspective, which I'm a consumer, I'm not a developer,
[00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:45.940]   you know, from the consumer perspective, it bums me out.
[00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:49.060]   That's only because you must have some non-Apple hardware.
[00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:51.300]   Well, I have friends with non-Apple.
[00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:52.860]   Why would you ever buy non-Apple?
[00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:54.860]   I'm never going to play those games.
[00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:55.860]   Okay.
[00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:56.860]   So I'm not going to play those games.
[00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:57.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:49:57.860 --> 00:49:58.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:49:58.860 --> 00:49:59.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:00.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:01.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:02.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:03.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:50:03.860 --> 00:50:04.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:50:04.860 --> 00:50:05.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:06.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:07.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:08.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:09.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:10.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:11.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:12.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:13.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:50:13.860 --> 00:50:14.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:33.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:36.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:37.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:38.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:39.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:50:39.860 --> 00:50:40.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:41.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:42.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:43.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:44.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:45.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:46.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:47.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:48.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:49.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:50.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:50:50.860 --> 00:50:51.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:50:51.860 --> 00:50:52.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:53.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:54.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:55.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:56.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:50:56.860 --> 00:50:57.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:50:57.860 --> 00:50:58.860]   I'm not going to play those games.

[00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:10.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:11.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:52:11.860 --> 00:52:12.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:13.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:14.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:15.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:16.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:17.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:52:17.860 --> 00:52:18.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:19.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:20.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:21.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:52:21.860 --> 00:52:22.860]   I'm not going to play those games.
[00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:28.380]   I mean, it's clear that they're heading that direction with the way the AR kit is being
[00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:31.380]   massively developed and pushed forward.
[00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:36.500]   The way everyone, all the heads at Apple, keep talking about AR going forward in the
[00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:40.140]   future of AR, you know they're all in.
[00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:42.140]   What's the next step after AR is VR?
[00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:45.460]   I think it's the other way around.
[00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:49.620]   I think what's happened with VR is it's been out here for a while now.
[00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:52.100]   You've seen a lot of companies do it.
[00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:54.780]   The market I think demand is dried up.
[00:52:54.780 --> 00:52:57.620]   And so I think except for specialized applications.
[00:52:57.620 --> 00:52:58.860]   Supply has not been great either.
[00:52:58.860 --> 00:53:03.140]   I mean I think for the most part what we've seen in VR are other choices.
[00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:05.620]   There's a lot of muddy lakes.
[00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:07.100]   That doesn't mean that there's a lot of water to drink.
[00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:08.100]   There's not a lot of good view.
[00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:09.340]   No, most of it's bad.
[00:53:09.340 --> 00:53:14.220]   I mean, of all the games, there's a handful of games on the Oculus that are worth playing
[00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:15.220]   in my opinion.
[00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:16.220]   It's hard to do, isn't it?
[00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:17.220]   It's really hard to do.
[00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:19.380]   And Roboree Call does it well.
[00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:23.060]   The one when you fly around, my son plays all the time is really good.
[00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:26.220]   But there's only a handful of them that are really, really well designed and well put
[00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:27.220]   together.
[00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:29.260]   And when you play them, you play them for a long time.
[00:53:29.260 --> 00:53:31.540]   Yeah, George plays Roboree Call I think, right?
[00:53:31.540 --> 00:53:33.900]   Laurie, I think that's the one she and her husband.
[00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:35.540]   Yeah, I think that's the one.
[00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:36.540]   Yeah.
[00:53:36.540 --> 00:53:42.020]   And so I think that the VR space right now is not done very well.
[00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:45.420]   I think the thing with the AR space is we're also not doing it for very long.
[00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:48.340]   So people are doing AR like, wow, this is amazing.
[00:53:48.340 --> 00:53:51.800]   And then they go off to their, they don't, the nice thing about AR right now with the
[00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:56.140]   phone is that you're not trying to sustain 20 minutes of interaction.
[00:53:56.140 --> 00:53:58.380]   You're sustaining minutes of interaction.
[00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:01.500]   And I think, and no one has an expectation that you're going to sustain more than that.
[00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:05.660]   And so I think that those are, and Apple's good at, Apple is--
[00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:08.380]   That's why I think AR is exciting because you're going to wear it all day.
[00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:10.420]   Well, I'll be wearing it on the show and fight.
[00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:11.420]   Oh, yeah.
[00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:14.060]   And what's great about the way that both Google and Apple are doing this.
[00:54:14.060 --> 00:54:19.260]   I mean, I think Google stepped too fast with Glass, you know, where they--
[00:54:19.260 --> 00:54:20.540]   Glass wasn't really AR.
[00:54:20.540 --> 00:54:21.540]   It could have been.
[00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:24.220]   But it had the ability to start dropping stuff in there.
[00:54:24.220 --> 00:54:28.780]   It just, the problem was is that the feature set, people weren't developing what you could
[00:54:28.780 --> 00:54:32.700]   do with Glass as fast as the detractors hit.
[00:54:32.700 --> 00:54:36.300]   You know, it's just everything is, you know, when possibility is greater than circumstance,
[00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:37.300]   you get action.
[00:54:37.300 --> 00:54:40.180]   And so the circumstance of the Glass was higher than the possibility of a long time.
[00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:42.220]   You've been reading down a jing or something?
[00:54:42.220 --> 00:54:43.220]   That's the way I say that again.
[00:54:43.220 --> 00:54:44.220]   Oh, sorry.
[00:54:44.220 --> 00:54:45.220]   Is that Laoza?
[00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:46.220]   What is that?
[00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:47.220]   No, that's an Alexism.
[00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:48.220]   I like it.
[00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:49.220]   That's how I run the whole company.
[00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:51.220]   Say that again.
[00:54:51.220 --> 00:54:57.340]   When possibility is greater than action, you get-- sorry, when possibility is greater than
[00:54:57.340 --> 00:54:58.700]   circumstance, you get action.
[00:54:58.700 --> 00:55:03.780]   And the delta between the possibility and the circumstance controls the speed of the
[00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:04.780]   action.
[00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:05.780]   I'm going to write that down.
[00:55:05.780 --> 00:55:06.780]   That's good.
[00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:07.780]   So anyway--
[00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:08.780]   I want that in a beautiful point.
[00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:09.780]   That is a good point.
[00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:10.780]   That is a great point.
[00:55:10.780 --> 00:55:12.780]   It's a great point.
[00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:14.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:15.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:16.780]   And I want to be a part of that.
[00:55:16.780 --> 00:55:17.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:18.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:19.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:20.780]   And I want to be a part of that.
[00:55:20.780 --> 00:55:21.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:55:21.780 --> 00:55:22.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:55:22.780 --> 00:55:23.780]   I want to be a part of that.

[00:55:26.780 --> 00:55:27.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:28.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:55:28.780 --> 00:55:29.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:55:29.780 --> 00:55:30.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:31.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:32.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:55:32.780 --> 00:55:39.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:40.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:41.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:42.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:55:42.780 --> 00:55:43.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:44.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:55:44.780 --> 00:55:45.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:46.780]   I want to be a part of that.

[00:55:47.780 --> 00:55:48.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:49.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:50.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:55:50.780 --> 00:55:51.780]   I want to be a part of that.

[00:55:56.780 --> 00:55:57.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:55:57.780 --> 00:55:58.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:55:58.780 --> 00:55:59.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:55:59.780 --> 00:56:00.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:01.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:02.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:02.780 --> 00:56:03.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:04.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:04.780 --> 00:56:05.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:06.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:07.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:08.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:09.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:10.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:10.780 --> 00:56:11.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:11.780 --> 00:56:12.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:13.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:13.780 --> 00:56:14.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:14.780 --> 00:56:15.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:16.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:16.780 --> 00:56:17.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:18.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:19.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:20.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:21.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:21.780 --> 00:56:22.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:22.780 --> 00:56:23.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:24.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:25.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:25.780 --> 00:56:26.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:27.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:28.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:28.780 --> 00:56:29.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:29.780 --> 00:56:30.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:30.780 --> 00:56:31.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:32.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:33.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:33.780 --> 00:56:34.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:34.780 --> 00:56:35.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:35.780 --> 00:56:36.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:36.780 --> 00:56:37.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:38.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:38.780 --> 00:56:39.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:40.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:41.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:42.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:42.780 --> 00:56:43.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:43.780 --> 00:56:44.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:44.780 --> 00:56:45.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:46.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:46.780 --> 00:56:47.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:47.780 --> 00:56:48.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:48.780 --> 00:56:49.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:49.780 --> 00:56:50.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:50.780 --> 00:56:51.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:52.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:52.780 --> 00:56:53.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:54.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:55.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:56.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:56.780 --> 00:56:57.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:57.780 --> 00:56:58.780]   I want to be a part of that.
[00:56:58.780 --> 00:57:05.220]   I think they're being smart in doing the development work that they're capable of doing and capable
[00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:11.740]   of shipping because we're still several years away from the ideal of I'm wearing glasses
[00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:17.740]   and you don't know whether I'm actually slightly nearsighted or I am actually using an AR headset
[00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:18.740]   or it's a little...
[00:57:18.740 --> 00:57:19.740]   I just...
[00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:24.020]   When I went to lens crafters, I bought my $99 frames and oh, for $500 more we can put
[00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:25.020]   in an AR projector.
[00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:26.020]   So great.
[00:57:26.020 --> 00:57:29.180]   Give me the $500 upgrade.
[00:57:29.180 --> 00:57:30.980]   But we still don't have that yet.
[00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:31.980]   As good as these...
[00:57:31.980 --> 00:57:36.740]   A lot of these demos are, they still require either super finicky experimental hardware
[00:57:36.740 --> 00:57:41.660]   or something that's practical but you have to wear a gaming computer on your belt.
[00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:46.260]   So right now what they're doing is with Apple and Google, Apple is giving the AR stuff
[00:57:46.260 --> 00:57:52.740]   so that when they have the headwear, they will be able to very naturally and fluidly add
[00:57:52.740 --> 00:57:57.660]   amendations to your view and not only is Google doing that but they're also showing
[00:57:57.660 --> 00:58:03.140]   off with Google lens which is again something that is on millions of Android phones right
[00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:04.140]   now.
[00:58:04.140 --> 00:58:05.860]   They're showing how easy it is to...
[00:58:05.860 --> 00:58:09.700]   We don't even have to wait for you to ask, "Hey, what is that thing...
[00:58:09.700 --> 00:58:11.860]   What is that thing off and to the left?"
[00:58:11.860 --> 00:58:14.260]   And I'm going to show you what that thing is.
[00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:18.260]   It's like, "No, just by looking at this video, I know that there are things that I can help
[00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:19.260]   you with.
[00:58:19.260 --> 00:58:23.100]   I'm really going to put a little dot on each one where I have something and eventually
[00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:26.820]   I'll get smart enough to know that you actually do want to know when you're...
[00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:31.460]   During these two weeks that you're in a foreign land, whenever there is a big sign, you want
[00:58:31.460 --> 00:58:33.340]   a translation of that sign.
[00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:38.780]   So the science fiction is still the wearable technology.
[00:58:38.780 --> 00:58:42.100]   The science, however, is the software and we're really close to that right now.
[00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:45.860]   And I think that Apple and Google, of course, are taking two very different times.
[00:58:45.860 --> 00:58:49.980]   I mean, Google is the big mind helping you with what you see in front of it.
[00:58:49.980 --> 00:58:52.300]   And Apple is handling a lot of how do we display it.
[00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:56.260]   So if you look at what Apple's doing, some of the other problems with developing this
[00:58:56.260 --> 00:58:58.460]   content is getting the assets, right?
[00:58:58.460 --> 00:59:02.380]   And so one of the big things we saw at WWDC also was Apple solving some of those.
[00:59:02.380 --> 00:59:06.100]   Number one, is metal is a big deal.
[00:59:06.100 --> 00:59:07.100]   You know, so...
[00:59:07.100 --> 00:59:11.780]   They're killing OpenGL, they're killing OpenGL, they're going to go all metal on every platform.
[00:59:11.780 --> 00:59:14.060]   And that makes it easier to do this...
[00:59:14.060 --> 00:59:15.260]   From their point of view, that's a really good experience.
[00:59:15.260 --> 00:59:18.900]   And a really good example of how proprietary can beat open.
[00:59:18.900 --> 00:59:22.820]   Because this means that you're going to develop ones, it doesn't matter what chips, it's all
[00:59:22.820 --> 00:59:25.140]   on Apple chips, it's going to work great.
[00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:27.980]   And by the way, that's why Apple's going to do their own chips too.
[00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:28.980]   And they're going to build, yeah, exactly.
[00:59:28.980 --> 00:59:34.060]   They'll be on the iPad, all this, and they're going to build accelerators for that format
[00:59:34.060 --> 00:59:35.780]   that are going to work amazingly well.
[00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:41.140]   And when you look at that combined with USDZ, which is their file format, that basically
[00:59:41.140 --> 00:59:46.100]   is a...there was already a file format that was out there USD, that is basically taking
[00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:50.300]   all the texture, the animation, everything, and being able to easily transport it.
[00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:54.220]   I'm going to be able to email you a 3D model that's dancing around or whatever, and you
[00:59:54.220 --> 00:59:57.500]   can literally open it in your iPhone, I mean, on your iPhone, but you can open it on your
[00:59:57.500 --> 01:00:00.540]   in mail, you know, or on your desktop.
[01:00:00.540 --> 01:00:04.300]   And that character is in 3D, and you can composite it over something, you can use AR
[01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:05.700]   to look at it.
[01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:06.700]   That is...
[01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:07.700]   I mean, that's the Holy Grail.
[01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:09.540]   What did you think of this UDZ format?
[01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:10.540]   Was that it?
[01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:12.540]   Yeah, it's revolutionary.
[01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:13.540]   I mean, it is...
[01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:15.540]   It's not that it's never existed before.
[01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:16.540]   It's a wrapper.
[01:00:16.540 --> 01:00:20.260]   So you could have various formats inside that wrapper?
[01:00:20.260 --> 01:00:23.060]   I think that it's actually going to sit on top of OBJ.
[01:00:23.060 --> 01:00:24.220]   I think it's sitting on top...
[01:00:24.220 --> 01:00:25.220]   I believe on top of OBJ.
[01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:27.220]   So we'll require OBJ, but that's a standard.
[01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:30.340]   I believe, and I haven't read through the entire format yet, but the point is, is that
[01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:33.300]   there's a set way to send stuff that you can get to it.
[01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:37.140]   It's not...there's nothing about it that is changing except that you have to organize
[01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:39.500]   it in a certain way in the file structure.
[01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:42.700]   There have been other things like this, FBX, OBJ, to some degree.
[01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:45.020]   This is almost as a spec for...
[01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:49.340]   If you want to interoperate with 3D objects, this is the format.
[01:00:49.340 --> 01:00:55.300]   And when Apple makes it available in Motion and Final Cut, when Adobe makes it available,
[01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:59.460]   it is going to be this thing that you can now just throw 3D models back and forth.
[01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:00.700]   Oh, I want to preview a 3D model.
[01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:02.140]   I can put it on this desk.
[01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:03.540]   I can do...
[01:01:03.540 --> 01:01:04.540]   It is...
[01:01:04.540 --> 01:01:05.540]   It's going...
[01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:08.260]   Because getting 3D information, it's not just the model.
[01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:09.260]   It's the model.
[01:01:09.260 --> 01:01:10.260]   It's the lighting.
[01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:11.900]   It's the animation.
[01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:15.380]   It's all of those things are going to be coming in the whole file format.
[01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:18.260]   If I send you a model, you're going to be able to just look at it, literally look at
[01:01:18.260 --> 01:01:20.460]   it in mail like you look at a photo and rotate it around.
[01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:22.020]   This is bad news not just for Intel.
[01:01:22.020 --> 01:01:24.900]   It's probably bad news for Nvidia as well, right?
[01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:25.900]   Yeah.
[01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:26.900]   Who are AMD?
[01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:27.900]   Apple...
[01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:30.300]   I mean, they probably do all of its own silicon, including the GPUs.
[01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:31.420]   I think eventually, yeah.
[01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:32.420]   I think that...
[01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:36.540]   I think we wonder whether at some point Apple looks harder at AMD.
[01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:40.420]   I mean, it's...
[01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:41.580]   But I think that...
[01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:43.900]   They're all radion now anyway, right?
[01:01:43.900 --> 01:01:45.540]   Yeah, same.
[01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:48.540]   How long do you want that to be external?
[01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:49.540]   Yeah.
[01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:50.540]   That was really...
[01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:56.700]   See, I wish you'd been here for the event because they kept talking about external GPUs
[01:01:56.700 --> 01:02:01.900]   as if that was a reasonable solution to their anemic graphics processing.
[01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:02.900]   Okay.
[01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:03.900]   Yeah.
[01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:07.060]   I think that it is pretty amazing what they did.
[01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:08.460]   You can do it, but...
[01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:10.460]   And the main thing is that you...
[01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:11.460]   Do you want to?
[01:02:11.460 --> 01:02:12.540]   Well, I mean, here's the deal.
[01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:13.540]   Is I can buy a big box.
[01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:18.740]   I've got some big PC boxes that I have four graphics processors built into them, but they're
[01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:22.780]   huge machines, you know, and they're expensive boards and everything else.
[01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:24.300]   The idea that I can build one box that just...
[01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:27.260]   I just add a bunch of GPUs to is something...
[01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:30.180]   So adding multiple GPUs is something that we...
[01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:32.180]   On the high end, we do all the time.
[01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:33.180]   So having three, four, five...
[01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:36.980]   Yeah, you don't mind their external despite the extra cost.
[01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:37.980]   And it isn't...
[01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:41.300]   I know it's Thunderbolt 3, but isn't it a little bit slower than having an internal and...
[01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:42.700]   It's definitely slower.
[01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:45.940]   It's not, but if you want to use a Mac and you want to have...
[01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:46.940]   That's the point.
[01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:47.940]   No, it's...
[01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:50.940]   It's a weak solution to a...
[01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:54.340]   Well, yeah, I mean, what we have to look at is what is going to happen when...
[01:02:54.340 --> 01:02:57.300]   If is there going to be a Mac Pro that is...
[01:02:57.300 --> 01:03:00.100]   That actually can take cards?
[01:03:00.100 --> 01:03:01.100]   Probably not.
[01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:02.100]   The speed is slow.
[01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:03.100]   I don't...
[01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:04.100]   We'll see.
[01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:05.100]   I mean, they...
[01:03:05.100 --> 01:03:06.900]   The hints have been modular, you know, like...
[01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:12.700]   Even when the Mac Pro could take cards, you had to take cards designed for a Mac Pro.
[01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:14.260]   Way back in the cheese grater days.
[01:03:14.260 --> 01:03:15.820]   You couldn't just buy off the open market.
[01:03:15.820 --> 01:03:16.820]   You had to get one that was...
[01:03:16.820 --> 01:03:17.820]   Had the right...
[01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:19.580]   They had proprietary wiring.
[01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:21.860]   But I think that that is going to be the thing that...
[01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:25.660]   If Apple wants to have a Mac Pro that is really worth having, they're going to have something
[01:03:25.660 --> 01:03:28.940]   that is easier to add the cards, easier to slot them in, more generalized...
[01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:30.580]   I don't see them doing that.
[01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:32.260]   Or maybe it's only Radeon.
[01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:36.820]   Maybe they only take Radeon cards as a process.
[01:03:36.820 --> 01:03:40.820]   More than once they mention this external GPU solution, I thought.
[01:03:40.820 --> 01:03:42.380]   Well, for developers, it's a big deal.
[01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:43.380]   I mean, it's...
[01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:49.660]   I mean, because again, we have a lot of solutions, whether it's live streaming or 360, that
[01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:50.860]   we already use external...
[01:03:50.860 --> 01:03:55.260]   I'm not external GPUs, we use multiple GPUs in the same machine to power it.
[01:03:55.260 --> 01:03:56.260]   Those are PCs.
[01:03:56.260 --> 01:03:57.260]   Those are PCs.
[01:03:57.260 --> 01:03:59.940]   Now, with the eGPU, I haven't done it yet.
[01:03:59.940 --> 01:04:02.020]   But from a developer's perspective, I'm looking at...
[01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:06.900]   I have an HTC at home getting the HTC tied up with the GPUs.
[01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:11.780]   And again, you may not ship something that requires that.
[01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:16.700]   But being able to build the development pipeline for it is useful.
[01:04:16.700 --> 01:04:20.660]   So Apple, it's not that they're ahead of everything.
[01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:22.100]   They have their own little...
[01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:25.580]   They have their clan, which is users.
[01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:29.420]   And their job is to keep on solving problems for their clan.
[01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:32.780]   And some things are ahead, some things are behind, some things are...
[01:04:32.780 --> 01:04:36.740]   But I think that as a Mac, I mean, there's definitely things that I use Linux and Windows
[01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:40.380]   for because it's not as fast or it's not available on the Mac.
[01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:41.380]   So it's not...
[01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:44.260]   As a pro user, you get used to just using all the operating systems.
[01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:50.180]   Given how long it's taken them to update the Mac Pro, I mean, they acknowledged last year
[01:04:50.180 --> 01:04:52.380]   that they screwed up, we're going to start over.
[01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:54.900]   Presumably they'd already begun the process.
[01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:58.220]   It's going to be another probably year before we see one.
[01:04:58.220 --> 01:05:00.780]   I don't think they have the iteration speed to keep up with the market.
[01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:01.860]   I really don't.
[01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:06.020]   And I think that's going to mean that pros like you eventually just abandon the Mac.
[01:05:06.020 --> 01:05:07.940]   I know you don't want to.
[01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:12.380]   There's still enough cross-platform support for a lot of those things.
[01:05:12.380 --> 01:05:18.180]   And if you look at the AR, VR stuff, especially the AR, and with UDC...
[01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:22.180]   I'm sorry, USDC, USDZ.
[01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:23.180]   You don't need to be on a Mac.
[01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:24.180]   You can develop everything on...
[01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:29.460]   You can develop everything in exports, though.
[01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:32.860]   The pro market is a tiny market from an Apple perspective.
[01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:36.340]   They need the pros, though, for several reasons.
[01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:39.380]   One, to develop content and programs.
[01:05:39.380 --> 01:05:44.020]   And two, because the pros are the people who go around saying, "I love my Mac and you
[01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:45.020]   all got to use Macs."
[01:05:45.020 --> 01:05:47.020]   They're the early adopters of it.
[01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:48.020]   Influencers.
[01:05:48.020 --> 01:05:51.580]   I think Apple needs to support people being able to develop for their platform.
[01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:54.580]   I think that's why Macs still is there.
[01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:58.180]   I guess they can go to the next code on Windows or Linux.
[01:05:58.180 --> 01:06:00.940]   I don't think they're going to do that.
[01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:04.980]   I think that the Mac is useful for some of the heavy lifting.
[01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:08.500]   And I think that they don't want to be seen as the small computer.
[01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:10.140]   So they're going to keep on building it.
[01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:13.900]   And the new iMac Pros are pretty interesting.
[01:06:13.900 --> 01:06:14.900]   Expensive?
[01:06:14.900 --> 01:06:16.900]   Yeah, but when you...
[01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:20.100]   Well, I mean, again, if you're talking about a pro user buying a machine...
[01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:21.940]   I'm not expensive for a pro.
[01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:24.420]   Those numbers aren't very big.
[01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:32.060]   I mean, the STI box that I used when I was at ILM was, I think, started at...
[01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:34.620]   I want to say, started at 18,000.
[01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:35.780]   And the bigger ones were 40,000.
[01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:37.340]   That was a bargain, by the way.
[01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:38.780]   That was probably the Idris or something.
[01:06:38.780 --> 01:06:40.780]   Those were the little indies.
[01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:41.780]   Yeah, those were the indies.
[01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:42.780]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:06:42.780 --> 01:06:44.340]   And I think there was a cheaper one.
[01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:46.420]   The really cheap one was like 8 or 12,000.
[01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:48.100]   It was like, "Oh, two?"
[01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:49.100]   A little "O2" boxes.
[01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:51.100]   That was a big deal when they announced those.
[01:06:51.100 --> 01:06:52.100]   Oh, yeah.
[01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:53.100]   It was like they're trying to move into the...
[01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:55.980]   The CI for practically as little as an iMac.
[01:06:55.980 --> 01:07:01.460]   Yeah, so, I mean, even now, once you start adding all the memory and everything else
[01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:04.060]   that you want for a pro box, these are not...
[01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:05.060]   These numbers...
[01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:06.060]   There was a long discretion.
[01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:07.060]   There was a long discretion.
[01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:12.380]   Well, again, and if you take the power that you have with these and you compare it to a similar
[01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:17.020]   PC, it's not dramatically more expensive than what they have.
[01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:19.380]   It is really a lot more expensive than a home computer, though.
[01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:24.420]   You also have to think about the fact that Apple doesn't make hundreds and hundreds of
[01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:25.420]   computers.
[01:07:25.420 --> 01:07:30.060]   So, a Windows computer, there's a bunch of original manufacturer factors that are making
[01:07:30.060 --> 01:07:35.100]   these computers so you can range from something really simple like a netbook all the way up
[01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:38.820]   to a super pro computer with lots of GPU.
[01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:42.540]   So the eGPU is Apple's sort of solution.
[01:07:42.540 --> 01:07:50.540]   And I see what you're saying, Leo, that it's sort of a band-aid on top of an existing problem,
[01:07:50.540 --> 01:07:55.460]   but Apple isn't out there making hundreds of different computers for everybody.
[01:07:55.460 --> 01:08:00.340]   So this is their version of that solution right now, which is an eGPU that you can use
[01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:09.020]   with a variety of Macs, different levels in their tiers of pro versus not-so-pro.
[01:08:09.020 --> 01:08:14.180]   And then hopefully when the Mac Pro comes out, it will have onboard, replaceable or
[01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:15.700]   adable GPU.
[01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:20.300]   But I think the eGPU is actually a really great solution when it comes to the fact that
[01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:26.940]   Apple can't produce every single different type of computer for every user out there.
[01:08:26.940 --> 01:08:28.660]   They can only do so much.
[01:08:28.660 --> 01:08:35.620]   And an eGPU box, it helps expand what you can do on a Mac that isn't as pro as the one
[01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:37.340]   that you purchased originally.
[01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:40.220]   And that's spot on.
[01:08:40.220 --> 01:08:48.540]   It's hard to judge all the companies because they are unique in that they have the responsibility
[01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:52.420]   and the requirement to build every single computer that runs their operating system
[01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:58.180]   in their software, which means that even they aren't capable of building 82% of the
[01:08:58.180 --> 01:09:03.120]   computers that people use worldwide, which is Windows market share, which so as much
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:07.120]   as it might disappoint someone like me who really wants to see more great consumer level
[01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:14.160]   Macs, they kind of are limited to only making and selling the Macs, the types of Macs that
[01:09:14.160 --> 01:09:16.800]   they think they can sell really great quantities with.
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:22.680]   And so if people are walking into a store and trying to find competition between a cheap
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:28.080]   but very well made Windows Notebook or even a Chromebook and an inexpensive consumer grade
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:33.080]   Mac and they're finding a lot of choices to make between those three, that's not the best
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:35.120]   investment for Apple.
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:39.400]   However, these super powerful machines that are going to be bought by people who either
[01:09:39.400 --> 01:09:44.160]   a have an absolute requirement that they have to own these like developers or it's so entire
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:48.520]   to their workflow that it would be really expensive to switch or they just simply like
[01:09:48.520 --> 01:09:49.520]   them.
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:55.360]   It's not hard to see that Apple is not hard to understand why Apple seems to be talking
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:10:00.840]   a lot about the pro level machines and nothing about like the Mac mini.
[01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:04.000]   Let's take a break.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.560]   Laurie Gill is here from iMore.
[01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:06.760]   It's great to have you Laurie.
[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:09.040]   She's deputy managing editor.
[01:10:09.040 --> 01:10:10.040]   Apple.
[01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:14.800]   The alcoholic on Twitter, APPA, H-O-L-I-K.
[01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:17.320]   Alex Lindsay is also here from the Pixel Core.
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:19.120]   Great to have you.
[01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:20.120]   Always nice to have you.
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:23.280]   You know, we missed you over the last few weeks because these are the pro issues.
[01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:24.600]   I really wanted that.
[01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:26.760]   I said Alex will have an opinion on this.
[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:28.720]   I haven't been on everything.
[01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:29.720]   You do.
[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:34.120]   I know what you think about dark mode and USDZ and all of this.
[01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:35.760]   I'm really glad you're here today.
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:36.760]   I'd be here.
[01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:42.080]   And of course the great Andy Enocho could do the show without him.
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:45.000]   IHNATKO.com.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.040]   Our show today brought to you by Euro Wi-Fi sucks.
[01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:49.040]   Have you noticed?
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:50.040]   Wi-Fi.
[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:52.480]   Wi-Fi really sucks.
[01:10:52.480 --> 01:10:54.560]   It was great when it first came out.
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:57.600]   You had one or two computers on the Wi-Fi network.
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:03.600]   You didn't have 15 neighbors with super powered routers out there killing your Wi-Fi.
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:09.080]   You weren't trying to stream Netflix in three different systems all at the same time.
[01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:12.880]   But you know, the reason Wi-Fi sucks today is because Wi-Fi is so great.
[01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:15.080]   Well now you can make Wi-Fi great again.
[01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:21.200]   Make Wi-Fi great again with Euro, the enterprise grade Wi-Fi system.
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:25.680]   You know, for a long time Wi-Fi has sucked in business a lot sooner than it sucked in
[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:26.680]   your house.
[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:30.800]   We had real problems in the brick house because we had a wide open space and lots of people
[01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:33.680]   using Wi-Fi and different Wi-Fi access points.
[01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:37.880]   And it was ultimately a mesh system like the Euro that solved our problems, but it wasn't
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:39.440]   a consumer product.
[01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:41.960]   It was too expensive and too difficult to configure.
[01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:45.840]   Along comes Euro and it saves the day.
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:48.840]   No more buffering, no more dead zones.
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:51.120]   Wi-Fi that works.
[01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:54.720]   I have Euro all over the house now.
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:59.880]   The Euro base station and then these Euro beacons are so awesome because you can extend the
[01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:02.080]   Wi-Fi, share the Wi-Fi out.
[01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:04.160]   It's not an extender and that's an important thing.
[01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:06.200]   Wi-Fi extenders have a negative feature.
[01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:11.200]   They cut the bandwidth in half because half the time they're talking to your laptop, but
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:14.920]   the other half the time they have to get the data from the Wi-Fi access point.
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:18.760]   So I don't know if you've noticed, but if you've tried Wi-Fi extenders, your bandwidth
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:20.920]   is literally one half.
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:24.920]   Not with the Euro, the Euro mesh system has its own independent backhaul.
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:30.880]   That means these beacons talk to the base station and you at the same time.
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:32.160]   So there's no slowdown.
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:35.440]   You get full speed Wi-Fi everywhere in the house.
[01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:38.040]   Each one of these units is good for about 1500 square feet.
[01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:41.280]   So you get as many units as you need to cover your house.
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:43.280]   This is the second generation Euro.
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:47.560]   They've learned a lot in the two years since they came out in early 2016.
[01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:52.120]   They've hundreds of thousands of customers, hundreds of thousands of Wi-Fi networks,
[01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:56.880]   and they've used the data to become faster, smarter, and more reliable.
[01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:01.320]   This is really a system that tailors itself to your usage.
[01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:03.920]   And that's pretty amazing.
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:09.680]   More speed, more range, the same high quality, elegant design that people have come to expect.
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:13.160]   These now are tri-band and with the addition of the new thread radio, I just turned on
[01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:18.200]   the thread radio because that allows you to connect to low power devices like locks and
[01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:20.800]   doorbells and other sensors.
[01:13:20.800 --> 01:13:25.360]   So this is really a great solution for the fully automated home.
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:26.760]   Expanding your coverage is easy.
[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:31.240]   As you can see on my network, I have the base unit in the office.
[01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:33.760]   Lisa wanted a hardwired Skype.
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:38.800]   So the base unit's in her office, hardwired to her Mac, but then it communicates with
[01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:43.040]   these four other beacons all around the network.
[01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:47.600]   And I can always, by the way, I'm looking at my network from here because the Eero app
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:48.600]   is awesome.
[01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:52.720]   I turned on Eero Plus too, which gives me all sorts of security and features that keep
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:56.120]   the kid offline after 10 p.m. things like that.
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:13:57.960]   It actually works with Amazon's Alexa.
[01:13:57.960 --> 01:14:05.520]   So if Michael's bad, I can say, "Echo, pause, Michael's Wi-Fi."
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:06.600]   The speed tests are great.
[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:09.040]   I always know what my current internet speed is.
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:11.400]   It does those automatically in the background.
[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:13.840]   I can look at all the connected devices.
[01:14:13.840 --> 01:14:18.120]   Right now, 38, 36 devices because we're not home.
[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:22.920]   That's just, that's the devices that are home when we're not.
[01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:26.880]   As soon as Lisa and Michael and I all come home, that'll go up by about 10.
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:28.400]   I love the Eero.
[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:34.360]   It has solved the biggest problem in my life, which was my wife saying, "The Wi-Fi's down,
[01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:37.080]   the Wi-Fi sucks fixed, the Wi-Fi."
[01:14:37.080 --> 01:14:39.920]   You know, the biggest insult.
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:41.560]   This was what really caused me to get the Eero.
[01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:46.000]   She said, "Well, you know, we can always get Russell to come over and fix it."
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:47.000]   "Oh, God.
[01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:48.360]   I said, "You're married to the tech guy.
[01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:49.360]   You want it?
[01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:50.360]   What?"
[01:14:50.360 --> 01:14:51.360]   She's manipulating you, Lisa.
[01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:52.360]   "No, Russell will do it.
[01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:53.360]   He'll fix it all."
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:54.360]   Then I got the Eero.
[01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:57.000]   I haven't heard that one in a while.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.000]   That's good.
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.000]   I love the Eero.
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.120]   You can have as many Eero beacons as if you want.
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:02.120]   They just plug into an outlet.
[01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:04.360]   So if there's an outlet, there's Wi-Fi.
[01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:09.240]   I put them in the hallway because then they have a little light, you know, a little light
[01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:10.840]   on them, which is great.
[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:13.680]   Although we have it Eero beacon and our bedroom, I turn off the lights, all the lights on
[01:15:13.680 --> 01:15:14.680]   that.
[01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:16.800]   So it's just a dark unit that you don't see.
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:19.440]   For free overnight shipping to the US or Canada, this is it.
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:20.440]   This is it.
[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:21.440]   Do it now.
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:22.440]   Upgrade your Wi-Fi.
[01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:24.600]   Life's too short for bad Wi-Fi.
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:30.520]   Go to Eero.com and at checkout, select overnight shipping, then enter Macbreak and it's free.
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:32.360]   So you'll have it tomorrow.
[01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:34.320]   Eero.com.
[01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:36.320]   Don't forget the code Macbreak.
[01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:38.400]   Not only does that get it to you for free overnight.
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:43.480]   It also lets them know you heard it here on Macbreak Weekly and we appreciate that.
[01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:48.420]   It's funny because I don't even, people call the radio show almost every week saying my
[01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:50.160]   Wi-Fi, what do I do?
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:52.080]   And now let's just get an Eero.
[01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:53.080]   Just get, just get.
[01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:54.360]   I don't have time for this.
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:56.280]   Ain't nobody got time for bad Wi-Fi.
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:58.380]   Get an Eero.
[01:15:58.380 --> 01:16:00.480]   Just like we used to say, get a Mac.
[01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:01.480]   Yeah.
[01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:02.480]   Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:06.640]   Actually, I should show you because on the Eero app, I have my mom, my mom has Eero too.
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:08.760]   So I could switch networks over to my mom's network.
[01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:13.760]   Even though she's in Rhode Island, I could switch over to her network, which is code
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:16.240]   named Piggy.
[01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:17.320]   And I can look at her Wi-Fi.
[01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:20.560]   So if she has problems, she doesn't have quite the network I do.
[01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:22.280]   Six connected devices.
[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:24.840]   But for an 85 year old, that's pretty darn good.
[01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:25.840]   Still good.
[01:16:25.840 --> 01:16:26.840]   Right?
[01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:27.840]   Six connected devices.
[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:31.520]   I actually, because she has it out, a building out in the back of her studio.
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:36.000]   So she has five as well because she needs to get all around the house.
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.040]   She's got, you can see she's got my old Eros.
[01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:40.040]   E-E-R-O.com.
[01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:42.240]   Don't forget Mac break.
[01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:44.160]   Get yourself free shipping overnight.
[01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:49.360]   And that's a nice thing to do for your family members, for your older family members, if
[01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:50.360]   they're having problems with their wife.
[01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:51.360]   And for yourself.
[01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:52.920]   Well, do it for yourself first.
[01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:55.680]   Well, but I mean, I'm saying like when you're going to, if you're going to help somebody,
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:57.480]   make sure that you help, it's going to work.
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:16:59.840]   Always put the mask on your face first.
[01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:02.800]   I think that's the rule.
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:04.800]   I think one of the most exciting.
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:10.320]   Okay, I actually now that I've digested WWDC a little bit, there's a couple of things I'm
[01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:11.320]   very excited about.
[01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:16.120]   Yes, Laurie, I will look forward to walkie talking you on my Apple Watch.
[01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:17.600]   Are you guys going to use it?
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:19.400]   Yes, we have two couples.
[01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:23.080]   We have five people in the studio besides you and me.
[01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:26.840]   And all five of them have Apple watches.
[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:29.920]   And so are the couples, are you going to walkie talkie each other?
[01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:30.920]   Yeah.
[01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:31.920]   Yeah.
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:34.760]   I think Paul, he doesn't look so happy about it.
[01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:37.360]   She raised her eyebrows.
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:41.880]   Well, maybe, maybe not.
[01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:42.880]   Maybe not.
[01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:46.360]   I don't know why you wouldn't.
[01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:48.240]   I mean, it's walkie talkies.
[01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:50.760]   But you know, it depends what it sounds like.
[01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:53.720]   Because like the old next-el phones, that would be a bad thing.
[01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:55.320]   But I'm hoping it won't do that.
[01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:57.920]   When you have your AirPods in, I guess it'll just be.
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:17:59.360]   Yeah, well, that'd be cool.
[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:00.840]   Yeah, that'd be cool.
[01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:02.480]   I was very excited about that.
[01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:05.400]   I'm very excited about it.
[01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:08.760]   It'd be cool if there were a watch band with an actual, even it's a fake little antenna.
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:14.640]   You have to extend before you can use the walkie talk feature.
[01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:17.080]   I would support the hell out of that Kickstarter.
[01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:22.480]   So the one thing that's no good about an actual wacky tucky is that each person has
[01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:24.640]   to have their wacky tuckies on.
[01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:28.800]   So I've told this story already, once on the iMAR show, my next-door neighbor is one of
[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:30.960]   my best friends, which is amazing.
[01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:34.280]   And we have wacky tuckies and we talk back and forth together.
[01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:35.280]   Wait a minute.
[01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:36.760]   That's like, "Stranger Things" or something.
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:37.760]   That's hysterical.
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:38.760]   I know.
[01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:39.760]   It's kind of easy.
[01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:41.680]   To get under the covers late at night and talk?
[01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:47.280]   No, but the reason we don't is that you have to get the other person to turn on their
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:49.720]   wacky tucky in order to use it.
[01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:56.080]   On Apple Watch, you only have to get the person on the other end to accept your request
[01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:57.920]   to have a wacky tucky session with them.
[01:18:57.920 --> 01:19:01.680]   So if they have their Apple Watch on, you don't have to text them and say, "Turn on
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:03.080]   your Apple Watch."
[01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:05.600]   You can just start your wacky tucky conversation.
[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:07.520]   That's what I'm most excited about.
[01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:11.160]   Though my next-door neighbor and best friend does not own an Apple Watch, so I'm going
[01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:13.480]   to have to buy her one.
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:17.360]   The other thing I'm excited about that didn't get coverage is the live listen features.
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:19.240]   I mean, the chat reminded me of this.
[01:19:19.240 --> 01:19:23.800]   I wear hearing aids, but live listen is a great idea.
[01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:27.600]   If you had hearing aids that you could pair with your Apple phone, which I do, you could
[01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:32.680]   put the phone on the table in a restaurant and hear better as people are talking.
[01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:35.120]   The phone microphone would be used.
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:39.600]   Well now with live listen, you'll be able to use your iPhone with your AirPods.
[01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:42.920]   So it'll be a directional microphone that the AirPods work with.
[01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:46.280]   So if you can't hear the TV too well, you put your phone by the TV.
[01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:49.440]   The microphone picks up the sound and it goes right into your ears.
[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:53.840]   The fact that you don't need thousands of dollars with the hearing aids to do this is
[01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:56.040]   really, really great.
[01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:58.320]   Or even just, I have so many people.
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:02.080]   I just have problems when I'm in a crowded restaurant and I just have to lean halfway
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:05.600]   over the table that you're somewhat talking because there's speakers all over the place
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:06.600]   and people are talking.
[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:11.440]   But the ability to just drop my phone next to their next to their salad plate and suddenly
[01:20:11.440 --> 01:20:13.440]   be able to hear them well, that's good.
[01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:16.920]   It's just one more reason to keep your AirPods in your ear at all times.
[01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:21.440]   I wonder why Apple would want you to do that.
[01:20:21.440 --> 01:20:25.320]   But the thing I'm most excited about, of all the things that they talked about and the
[01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:30.320]   thing I think that will mean that I probably don't carry an Android phone after iOS 12
[01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:32.800]   comes out is Siri shortcuts.
[01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:36.640]   This is somewhere Apple has gone well beyond what Android can do.
[01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:38.360]   I'm very excited about this.
[01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:45.880]   And because Apple's ecosystem of developers is a completely different beast than the Android
[01:20:45.880 --> 01:20:51.840]   ecosystem, you know that Apple app developers will build in this capability into their app.
[01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:56.360]   They'll flip that switch almost right away, which means I'll have access to a bunch of
[01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:58.640]   application features in Siri.
[01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:02.680]   The shortcuts features means I'll be able to combine functions from various applications
[01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:06.160]   into a single stack of a single routine.
[01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:08.380]   To me, I cannot wait to use this.
[01:21:08.380 --> 01:21:10.360]   This is going to be huge.
[01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:12.680]   It's workflow for Siri.
[01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:14.240]   It's brilliant.
[01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:17.720]   It's going to just kind of revolutionize how we use Siri.
[01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:22.640]   And the article that you're looking at right now is Renee is kind of talking about the
[01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:28.240]   confusion that people might be having right now of using Siri as a voice command.
[01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:33.840]   And this Siri suggestions, which is going to be all kind of intermixed, intermingled
[01:21:33.840 --> 01:21:40.840]   in with the Siri shortcuts, you don't have to build a Siri command, which is actually
[01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:43.240]   the thing I'm looking forward to the most.
[01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:51.960]   But you can let Siri know that you use this particular app and what you use it for.
[01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:54.880]   And it will just send you a notification.
[01:21:54.880 --> 01:22:01.440]   If you're at your kid's school and you set up some sort of calendar enablement that says,
[01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:08.440]   you know, pick up Janet at, you know, room 105 on Tuesdays, you'll get the little notification
[01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:09.440]   pop up.
[01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:10.440]   You don't have to say something.
[01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:13.680]   You don't have to command Siri to remind you of anything.
[01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:17.320]   You'll just get this little notification that says, hey, it looks like you're at Janet's
[01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:18.320]   school on Tuesdays.
[01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:21.120]   You're supposed to go over to room 105.
[01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:22.120]   It just pops up.
[01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:23.120]   It just pops up.
[01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:24.120]   It's just there for you.
[01:22:24.120 --> 01:22:30.280]   So using these third party apps to create these recipes, it's very simple.
[01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:33.800]   I haven't, you know, shortcuts doesn't exist yet in iOS 12.
[01:22:33.800 --> 01:22:35.240]   So we haven't had access to it.
[01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:41.920]   But from what they showed off in the WWDC demonstration, it looks like it's going to
[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:44.720]   be easy to set these recipes up.
[01:22:44.720 --> 01:22:46.160]   And then you're just good to go.
[01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:48.040]   You're good to kind of do your life.
[01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:50.760]   You don't have to command Siri to do anything.
[01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:56.720]   The Siri commands are, to me, the icing on the cake because you can then request, for
[01:22:56.720 --> 01:23:04.520]   example, to have, you can play, you know, Spotify through asking your Siri to do that
[01:23:04.520 --> 01:23:08.960]   for you, which I think is, to me, it's going to open up the world of the Siri commands
[01:23:08.960 --> 01:23:11.120]   for what we have to come in the future.
[01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:17.800]   Things that we've always felt were shortcomings with the virtual assistant right now.
[01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:23.280]   It's actually genius because it solves two big problems.
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:25.600]   One, Siri's dumb.
[01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:30.640]   And you know, Google now will make suggestions like it's time for you to leave for work because
[01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:35.600]   Google, as we know, eavesdrops, eavesdrops on everything I do, where I am, what time
[01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:38.120]   I go to work all that stuff so it can do that.
[01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:42.600]   So Apple, Siri's dumb partly because Apple doesn't want to do that kind of snooping.
[01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:49.440]   So what Apple's done is they've pushed out the snooping to the apps that let Phil's coffee
[01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:51.560]   watch what you get and what time you get it.
[01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:54.920]   And let Siri know that's why you get this.
[01:23:54.920 --> 01:23:59.360]   Hey, usually you're ordering a mitt mojito at this time.
[01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:01.560]   So you want one?
[01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:04.400]   And that gets Apple off the hook.
[01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:08.480]   They also with suggestions solve another big problem, which is you and I, Laurie, are going
[01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:12.320]   to create all sorts of, you know, we're going to tinker and tinker and create all sorts of
[01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:13.320]   stuff.
[01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:14.320]   Most people don't, we'll never do that.
[01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:15.320]   Don't want to do that.
[01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:19.000]   So kind of automating this a little bit and giving you stuff.
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.680]   Hey, would you like to do this?
[01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:22.920]   Is it actually a very good solution, I think?
[01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:24.640]   I'm sorry, Andy, I interrupted you.
[01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:26.520]   No, I was going to say something similar to that.
[01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:30.440]   One of the biggest problems with digital assistance for the user is that you have to
[01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:34.560]   know that it's smart enough that it's, you can know, you have to know that you can ask
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:36.720]   it to do something and it will do this thing.
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:40.960]   So one of the problems is how do you surface the actual power of this assistant?
[01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:45.120]   Like how do you like, how do you surface the ability to know that, hey, I don't actually
[01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:49.280]   have to go into like my MBTA app and purchase commuter real tickets.
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:53.440]   I can just simply say, get me tickets to get me, get me around trip ticket to Back Bay
[01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:54.840]   Station and we'll do it.
[01:24:54.840 --> 01:25:01.960]   So the ability for proactive surfacing of this stuff is a really, really great idea.
[01:25:01.960 --> 01:25:09.120]   Also, as much as we admire the smarts of the Google Assistant and it really is impressive
[01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:14.280]   how much you can simply understand and work out on its own, there's something, it's not
[01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:17.560]   necessarily the best solution to every problem.
[01:25:17.560 --> 01:25:24.280]   What if you have an assistant that won't figure out that you always take a certain train
[01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:29.120]   at the Back Bay Station on Wednesday and you always get a coffee at the train station on
[01:25:29.120 --> 01:25:30.360]   your way over there?
[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:34.840]   What if there was just a really simple way, if what if the assistant simply said, hey,
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:39.480]   I noticed that you simply, you're going to Back Bay Station again, is there anything
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:42.080]   that I can do to help you on this trip?
[01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:45.400]   And then it just simply gives you all these Lego tiles to say, here are things that I
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:46.600]   can do for you.
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:49.960]   Just tell me what you want me to do whenever you're headed in the car, whenever you park
[01:25:49.960 --> 01:25:53.480]   your car, let's say at this garage and it will do it.
[01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:58.600]   So that's not quite as magnificent, not as impressive a demo, but it gets you your ticket
[01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:02.680]   and your coffee without you ever having, with your only having to ask for it once.
[01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:08.240]   So it's a really neat, different idea, different approach toward being a smart assistant.
[01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:11.160]   Yeah, I think we're just getting started too.
[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:14.720]   When the app developers start to really take advantage of it, I think that tying those
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:19.880]   things in and getting to go between everything is going to, we're, we can imagine things,
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:23.200]   but I think that there's definitely going to be one of those things that it's just explosive,
[01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:26.440]   that you can tie this to this and have these things go back and forth.
[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:32.400]   And I think that I can just imagine a lot of things that I just want to get handled,
[01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:37.480]   and be able to just say, I need you to handle this and have it execute a series of things
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:38.480]   to do that.
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:42.320]   The potential is great, of course, as with many things Apple announces, it's going to
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:43.600]   depend on it happening.
[01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:44.680]   Well, and I think that that is--
[01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:46.360]   People adopting it and so forth.
[01:26:46.360 --> 01:26:52.040]   I think for all the technology companies, what they focus a lot on is software and hardware,
[01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:55.240]   and what they don't focus on enough is what we're actually training--
[01:26:55.240 --> 01:26:56.240]   Get the humans to do it.
[01:26:56.240 --> 01:26:57.240]   Get the humans to do it.
[01:26:57.240 --> 01:27:02.440]   Doing things that are, I think Apple, I think building a full-featured game in AR and then
[01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:06.120]   releasing the code is a great example of what they should be doing, but they should be doing
[01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:07.120]   a lot more of that.
[01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:11.480]   You know, where you're really giving people, you know, giving developers like, I'm going
[01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:13.560]   to do something really, really great that is really cool.
[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:16.600]   I'm going to give you all the code to show you how I did it.
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:18.600]   Doing more and more of that, I think, is something that's--
[01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:20.600]   Apple needs to bring back Kai Kawasaki.
[01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:22.040]   They need to bring back the evangelists.
[01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:23.800]   They have evangelists, I think.
[01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:24.800]   Do they?
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:25.800]   Yeah.
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:29.080]   Do you get the sense that I always-- maybe it's just because I don't know, but I get
[01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:32.040]   sense Apple has a certain amount of arrogance.
[01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:36.000]   They demonstrated that to me when they talked about how they're designing the Mac Pro by
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:41.800]   bringing people in-house, hiring people so they could watch how they work.
[01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:47.560]   I think, to your point exactly, Apple, even though it's the most valuable company in
[01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:53.200]   the history of companies, should really get out there and start proselytizing and working
[01:27:53.200 --> 01:27:55.000]   with people and getting them to do this stuff.
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:01.560]   Well, working with them and also, I mean, the-- I think that iBooks could be a lot more
[01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:02.560]   than what it is.
[01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:04.560]   That's another great example.
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:06.200]   It's a good example.
[01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:10.880]   You have this incredible engine that could create interactive learning.
[01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:13.560]   That's all they're ready to do that.
[01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:16.920]   But what you don't get any of that because there aren't really good examples.
[01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:21.080]   I mean, Apple could-- I mean, my opinion, should spend a billion dollars a year generating
[01:28:21.080 --> 01:28:22.080]   content out of it.
[01:28:22.080 --> 01:28:26.440]   And the mistake that they made at the beginning was they actually went to the big-- I don't
[01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:32.480]   know how much money they spent, but they definitely worked with book companies, but
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:33.480]   they went to Pearson.
[01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:34.480]   Yeah.
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:35.480]   And what they got was--
[01:28:35.480 --> 01:28:36.480]   Yeah.
[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:37.480]   The big mistake.
[01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:40.520]   The book companies just lived inside their own little bucket of what you can do with a book.
[01:28:40.520 --> 01:28:45.560]   And that was a clear version of if you have a hammer, everything's a nail, or if you have
[01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:49.000]   a screwdriver, you screw everything up.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:56.160]   So anyway, but the-- I think that that is-- they just got more of the same that was kind
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:57.160]   of in this.
[01:28:57.160 --> 01:28:58.360]   It's kind of like, well, we want to make films.
[01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:01.160]   So let's take video of stage of the stage.
[01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:04.480]   We're going to go to Broadway and take videos of the stage.
[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:06.240]   Now you're getting the worst of both experiences.
[01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:08.800]   You don't get the live experience of being there.
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:10.400]   And the camera angles are bad.
[01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:12.160]   And that's how film started.
[01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:14.040]   I mean, that's why I took a long time to get it off the ground.
[01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:15.480]   They're like, it's OK.
[01:29:15.480 --> 01:29:20.680]   Once they realized they didn't have to do what stage was doing, film became a big deal.
[01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:26.160]   And we have to get to a point where media is not a book converted with a couple of moving
[01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:29.440]   videos, but it is an entirely new experience.
[01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:32.160]   And the iBooks is capable of doing that.
[01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:33.840]   It is capable-- it has all the tools.
[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:37.760]   It's just that nobody-- Apple needs to-- I do think that Apple needs to pay people to
[01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:38.760]   do it.
[01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:40.760]   And it's a good thing to get-- because it's a risk.
[01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:42.600]   The market is a chicken or egg thing.
[01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:45.680]   The market is not big enough to build that book right now.
[01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:49.800]   So that book is going to cost 10 times more than it's worth in the beginning.
[01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:55.800]   But you have to give people-- so you have to prime that system by spending that money
[01:29:55.800 --> 01:29:57.280]   and getting it off the ground.
[01:29:57.280 --> 01:30:00.600]   And it would be expensive because it's trying to do something different.
[01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:04.920]   But I think that all the companies don't spend enough money promoting their product.
[01:30:04.920 --> 01:30:08.720]   Well, we need to tell every app developer, every app that we use, get to--
[01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:10.000]   theory shortcut support.
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:15.120]   Do you have a sense of how much of this comes from Apple and how much of it comes from third
[01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:16.120]   parties?
[01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:22.840]   Is Apple doing some of the content as well?
[01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:27.800]   As far as I know, this is just all third party app developers.
[01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:30.480]   Apple might be doing something with their own built-in apps.
[01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:35.520]   Again, I have no access to the series shortcut.
[01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:36.760]   So it's just not out.
[01:30:36.760 --> 01:30:39.720]   So you're using 12, but it's just not in the beta yet.
[01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:42.920]   It's just not in the beta yet, correct, yeah.
[01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:44.280]   Renee's article is excellent.
[01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:50.120]   And he says this is really the move from pull to push instead of you going out there
[01:30:50.120 --> 01:30:55.200]   and telling an interface what you need and programming it.
[01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:58.480]   Pushing it into the notifications is really a good idea.
[01:30:58.480 --> 01:31:03.640]   And he says it's really automation, not for power users, but for the mainstream.
[01:31:03.640 --> 01:31:05.480]   And I think that's a good point.
[01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:08.000]   I do hope that it lives up to its promise.
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:13.320]   I hope that it gets support from third party developers because I think it could potentially
[01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:18.320]   -- this is where Apple could actually -- if this lives up to its promise, as I said,
[01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:19.640]   I would stop using an Android.
[01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:24.160]   I use both Apple and Android, but I would not feel the need to use Android at all if
[01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:25.560]   Apple started doing some of that stuff.
[01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:27.800]   In fact, I would say, God, I have to have my iPhone.
[01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:30.280]   What do I do without my Siri reminders?
[01:31:30.280 --> 01:31:36.720]   I think the rock style ads that basically got you excited about features, but also taught
[01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:37.720]   you about the features.
[01:31:37.720 --> 01:31:41.320]   I mean, the most important part of the rock ad was that it taught you all these things
[01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:42.320]   that are about to do it.
[01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:43.320]   I can do that.
[01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:44.880]   And I think Apple should do all ads like that.
[01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:49.040]   But I think, though, I have to say that's another pull interaction.
[01:31:49.040 --> 01:31:50.040]   And that's the challenge of the pull.
[01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:51.800]   You have to teach people a syntax.
[01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:54.600]   You have to give them the idea that they can do it and then teach them the syntax and
[01:31:54.600 --> 01:31:56.000]   then get them to do it.
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:59.880]   And unless you do it every day, like that's why everybody uses their Amazon Echo to sit
[01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:04.320]   cooking timers, but for very little other things, right?
[01:32:04.320 --> 01:32:05.880]   Because you got to do it every day.
[01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:11.680]   So that's why I think push could really be a big step forward where the phone and I admittedly,
[01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:13.240]   we already get too many notifications.
[01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:16.960]   So this goes hand in hand with managing notifications better, which Apple's also doing.
[01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:21.040]   But I think if the phone can say a gentle nudge, hey, did you know, you know, would
[01:32:21.040 --> 01:32:23.280]   you like me to make this a routine?
[01:32:23.280 --> 01:32:26.040]   And you say yes, and then it starts doing that?
[01:32:26.040 --> 01:32:27.960]   I think that's the way to do it.
[01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:32.800]   I've noticed that your heart rate was very high.
[01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:34.760]   Would you like to send your wife some flowers?
[01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:36.240]   It already does that.
[01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:37.240]   Yeah.
[01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:39.200]   I hear you talking to your wife and she doesn't seem happy.
[01:32:39.200 --> 01:32:40.200]   Yeah.
[01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:42.000]   We can order that from FTV today.
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000]   Would you like the big row?
[01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:45.000]   There's a lot of potential.
[01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:46.600]   There's a lot of potential.
[01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:50.040]   Yeah, this is going to be very interesting to see.
[01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:55.280]   You know, I always try to temper my excitement because like with iBooks, we were all excited
[01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:58.400]   about iBook author and it just never went anywhere.
[01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:02.920]   And then I think you got to temper your because Apple's showing you the potential.
[01:33:02.920 --> 01:33:03.920]   Right.
[01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:07.680]   They're showing you this is how it could be, but there's no guarantee that that's what
[01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:08.680]   will happen.
[01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:13.320]   And so I don't know if I can help evangelize or some.
[01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:17.360]   This is a future I really like the idea of.
[01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:23.000]   Anything else we want to talk about from the Apple event, there are rumors going forward.
[01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:27.560]   I don't know if you saw the R's Technica article that Apple is going to be ditching physical
[01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:32.480]   buttons on the Apple Watch.
[01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:34.120]   This is actually a fast company.
[01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:36.520]   I should give them citing a source with direct knowledge.
[01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:38.680]   So let me give fast company.
[01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:39.680]   This makes sense.
[01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:43.480]   I mean, the biggest problem Apple Watch has is user interface.
[01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:47.480]   Well, it's the which I'm of two minds on this.
[01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:49.400]   I think it's a good.
[01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:52.280]   I think that the clicky buttons have a place.
[01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:56.480]   I think they're a really good idea, particularly on something like a watch where sometimes maybe
[01:33:56.480 --> 01:34:01.600]   you don't want to you're doing that sort of like one handed sneak to press a button
[01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:03.600]   and activate something.
[01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:06.960]   So I don't I wish that I wish that there is still something to click.
[01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:10.960]   On the other hand, I think that the the scroll wheel just isn't working.
[01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:13.400]   I still think that there's there.
[01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:14.520]   I almost never use it.
[01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:16.800]   I use it as a push button and that's pretty much it.
[01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:21.080]   Also now that it's summer and spring again, it gets gunked up with like sweat and stuff.
[01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:24.760]   So it doesn't really roll the way that it did when my watch was new.
[01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:29.720]   On the other hand, there'd be nothing more natural, I think, than to make just the the
[01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:35.260]   outer edge of the watch into just basically a touch strip so that it can actually you
[01:34:35.260 --> 01:34:38.120]   can actually be swiping your finger across it.
[01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:41.800]   So you wouldn't have to engage the this little knob, but you could still scroll, scroll,
[01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:43.440]   scroll without blocking the screen.
[01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:48.800]   And also by making it by reducing the number of actual physical clicky buttons, you're making
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:52.320]   it more resistant to dust to sweat to moisture.
[01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:58.240]   So I I I'm sure that if they did it, it would make complete sense.
[01:34:58.240 --> 01:35:01.720]   And I think that would be an improvement to the product.
[01:35:01.720 --> 01:35:03.600]   Yeah.
[01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:06.640]   They say solid state buttons will make the watch more water resistant.
[01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:08.560]   That makes sense.
[01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:09.640]   Less space in the design.
[01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:10.640]   That makes sense.
[01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:15.440]   Remember we were there was an interview with Johnny Ivan where he talked about how software
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:20.000]   is cool because it could any any functionality could be just written into the software.
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:23.040]   But he did say that there's a certain advantage to having a button that does not something
[01:35:23.040 --> 01:35:26.440]   one thing as the thing you do the most.
[01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:30.240]   I actually use the digital crown to scroll, but that's because I use the Siri watch face.
[01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:33.440]   And so that's the one watch face where scrolling actually does something.
[01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:35.440]   It's funny because I don't even think about it.
[01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:39.400]   The only time I touch the crown is when I'm trying to go to some app and I don't do that
[01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:42.760]   even very often because I have what I want on my on my on your watch face.
[01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:43.760]   On the watch face.
[01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:48.040]   The crown will still according to this fast company article.
[01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:53.280]   Apple will continue using the current button configuration with a button and digital crown
[01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:58.200]   on one side, but neither will physically click as before rather than reacting to the users
[01:35:58.200 --> 01:35:59.920]   touched by physically moving back and forth.
[01:35:59.920 --> 01:36:04.600]   The new buttons will vibrate little taptic feedback.
[01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:08.480]   So there the buttons won't move but they'll be there.
[01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:10.040]   All right.
[01:36:10.040 --> 01:36:17.520]   I can speak to the experience of the fake button that with taptic feedbacks that really work
[01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:21.000]   the iPhone seven and eight.
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.560]   The not real button.
[01:36:23.560 --> 01:36:24.560]   It's amazing.
[01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:25.560]   It feels great.
[01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:27.280]   I show it off to my friends.
[01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:31.720]   I'll make them, you know, like I'll put a towel over it and I'll tell them touch the button
[01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:33.720]   and they'll be like, there's no button.
[01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:34.720]   Well, that's clever.
[01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:38.040]   And I'm like, yes, there's no button there.
[01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:39.040]   That's very clever.
[01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:42.160]   I think it's it fools me every time.
[01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:47.000]   There's something I always when I touch the home button and it's the batteries dead.
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.600]   It feels like the phone is dead.
[01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:51.560]   Like it's like it doesn't respond.
[01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:54.080]   There's something very like cold and sad.
[01:36:54.080 --> 01:37:00.840]   It's like I have that same experience with my with my MacBook because I know that well,
[01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:02.680]   it's not waking up like, Oh, damn it.
[01:37:02.680 --> 01:37:05.680]   I'm not getting a response to the track that I am boned.
[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:06.680]   Yeah.
[01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:07.680]   Yeah.
[01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:09.800]   It's something like it's like a dead phone.
[01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:11.960]   You're just like, Oh, poor phone.
[01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:12.960]   Here's another one.
[01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:17.800]   Here's another rumor from Mac rumors that actually comes from digit times originally
[01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:23.960]   that will be a little more controversial digitized says that in 2019 next year, not
[01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:32.120]   this year, iPhones will start coming with USB C. They're redesigning chargers and related
[01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:36.800]   interface for its next generation iPhone and iPad devices and will likely have its 2019
[01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:40.200]   series of iPhones come with a USB type C support.
[01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:42.240]   Now that could mean an adapter.
[01:37:42.240 --> 01:37:43.240]   It could.
[01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:49.520]   I mean, with Apple's big push to the USB C and on the on the laptops, I do see that
[01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:52.240]   it feels like at some point you're going to see all USB C.
[01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:54.480]   Yeah, it sort of seems like it's been a long time coming.
[01:37:54.480 --> 01:37:57.600]   I'm actually surprised they didn't do that sooner.
[01:37:57.600 --> 01:37:58.960]   It would make me happy.
[01:37:58.960 --> 01:38:00.840]   I have a lot of types of chargers.
[01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:05.960]   Although type C is such a mess in terms of capabilities, you can't look at that port
[01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:07.560]   and know what it does.
[01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:08.560]   Right.
[01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:10.360]   Well, but Apple can control it.
[01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:15.440]   Apple can do an implementation of USB C that really, really works for everybody.
[01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:19.080]   And the idea of having one port to rule them all is something that is definitely on Apple's
[01:38:19.080 --> 01:38:20.080]   side.
[01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:25.200]   They're also in the situation where they can't they're in certain markets where a proprietary
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:29.720]   lightning connector isn't going to fly for the local market.
[01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:34.480]   And frankly, there's just apart from the amount of space that that connector might take up
[01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:36.920]   inside of really small device.
[01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:40.040]   I don't know what kind of advantage they're getting from lightning right now.
[01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:44.560]   So if it's nothing, it seems like it's nothing but upside for them.
[01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:48.240]   And I don't think that there is a not my backyard, not developed here.
[01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:51.160]   So I'm sorry, not developed here philosophy at Apple.
[01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:52.840]   I don't think that's an effect either.
[01:38:52.840 --> 01:38:55.520]   So yeah, I could see that happening next year.
[01:38:55.520 --> 01:38:57.440]   Is lightning better than USB C?
[01:38:57.440 --> 01:39:00.320]   No, it's not as fast anymore.
[01:39:00.320 --> 01:39:02.280]   It's not, you know, it doesn't have a lot of the features.
[01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:04.800]   I will say that I like the lightning connector better.
[01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:07.600]   I like that it's a solid unit.
[01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:09.720]   And then it's not hollow.
[01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:11.880]   It picks up things and I travel a lot.
[01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:13.600]   So I'm worried about those kinds of things.
[01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:17.840]   So the fact that it's one solid little piece that pops in, I like the feel of it and the
[01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:19.320]   use of it better.
[01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:23.160]   But features feature wise, it's lower features than then USB C at this point.
[01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:28.480]   If you want a little microcosm that illustrates this duality of open interoperable versus
[01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:33.480]   walled garden and the advantages of each, this is a great example because because lightning
[01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:37.680]   is completely controlled by Apple, there's no confusion about what lightning does.
[01:39:37.680 --> 01:39:41.360]   If you get a made for iPhone lightning cable, you know it will do what it's supposed to
[01:39:41.360 --> 01:39:42.360]   do.
[01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:46.080]   Whereas in Type C, it's madcap.
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:48.360]   You don't know what the heck you're going to get.
[01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:53.720]   They're even at the point where a Google employee, Benson Leung, had to go on Amazon
[01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:59.800]   pages for Type C cable saying don't buy this one, it will fry your device.
[01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:04.920]   You know, he actually did a lot of good eventually getting Amazon to remove the bad Type C cables.
[01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:06.880]   But the fact that that could even happen.
[01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:09.120]   There's bad lightning cables up there too.
[01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:12.200]   You have to just get you have to get made for iPhone and you're all right.
[01:40:12.200 --> 01:40:13.640]   Yeah, I'm a fine.
[01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:15.320]   I think there is it there is an event.
[01:40:15.320 --> 01:40:18.160]   That's the example of the advantage of the walled garden.
[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:20.720]   And that is advantage because Type C is cheaper.
[01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:21.720]   It's universal.
[01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:25.880]   I could charge a whole bunch of things with Type C. I only have one thing left to type
[01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:31.680]   well, two things because of my iPad, two things left to charge with lightning.
[01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:35.360]   I think in a lot of ways, I mean, we're talking about this over the weekend.
[01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:40.760]   A lot in a lot of ways, I think that Apple, the Apple user, the prototypical Apple user
[01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:45.320]   cares less about the device actually and more about what they're doing than you know.
[01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:48.920]   So I think when you really want all those all that flexibility and all those other bits
[01:40:48.920 --> 01:40:50.600]   and pieces, you really are into the device.
[01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:55.520]   You really want to suck up all the things and Apple users just kind of want it to work.
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:40:58.840]   They don't want that to be part of their daily thing.
[01:40:58.840 --> 01:41:03.200]   They just want to turn it on like what I use my Mac for and what I use my iPhone for.
[01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:05.680]   I just want to turn on and do its thing.
[01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:10.800]   What I use my Android phone for and what I use my Linux and Windows, those are really
[01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:12.640]   geeky things to do.
[01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:17.320]   You know, like those are, you know, but I don't want to write I don't want to write papers
[01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:18.320]   on it.
[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:22.760]   I want to build, you know, like I want when I'm doing that kind of thing, I just want
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:23.760]   it to work.
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:24.760]   Yeah.
[01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:26.080]   All right, let's take a break.
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:30.640]   And if you will, prepare your picks of the week that's next on Mac Break Weekly, our show
[01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:36.720]   today brought to you by as my website is WordPress.com.
[01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:38.360]   Reach more customers.
[01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:39.640]   Do a better job.
[01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:45.520]   Spend less time tweaking and more time publishing on WordPress.com.
[01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:46.520]   I learned that lesson.
[01:41:46.520 --> 01:41:49.880]   I'm going to happy WordPress customer forever, practically since it started.
[01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:56.000]   But when I moved to WordPress.com, I realized, oh, I'm posting more and tweaking less WordPress.com
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:42:01.640]   runs the software, keeps it up to date, does all the hosting and gives you great templates
[01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:07.040]   and plugins, everything you need to make a great website without doing any coding or
[01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:08.040]   any design.
[01:42:08.040 --> 01:42:10.400]   If you want to, you can, but you don't have to.
[01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:14.440]   Plus, I never had a customer support team for my WordPress install.
[01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:16.240]   I do it WordPress.com.
[01:42:16.240 --> 01:42:21.800]   They're there 24/7 Monday through Friday, even on weekends, to help you if you have any questions,
[01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:23.800]   any solution you need.
[01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:27.880]   They've got great e-commerce options ranging from simple and effective buy button to a complete
[01:42:27.880 --> 01:42:29.080]   online store.
[01:42:29.080 --> 01:42:30.280]   And they're very affordable.
[01:42:30.280 --> 01:42:33.080]   Your plan starts at as little as $4 a month.
[01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:39.520]   I have a business plan and I love that because I can do all sorts of stuff, including e-commerce
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:45.000]   and SEO tools and a whole bunch of great plugins and themes.
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.080]   I can even bring my own.
[01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:48.760]   So I just, I'm a big fan.
[01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:51.440]   30% of all the websites in the world run on WordPress.
[01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:53.000]   I'm not surprised.
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:54.640]   I'm really not surprised.
[01:42:54.640 --> 01:42:59.880]   If you're a business, you don't have a website, no, your Facebook page does not count.
[01:42:59.880 --> 01:43:00.880]   You don't own that.
[01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:04.640]   You need a site you own that's yours that you make your own and that's WordPress.
[01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:06.840]   WordPress.com/MacBreak.
[01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:09.840]   If you go there, you'll save 15% on any new plan purchase.
[01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:10.840]   15%.
[01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:13.280]   WordPress.com/MacBreak.com.
[01:43:13.280 --> 01:43:21.280]   It's easy to move over to if you're on another platform.
[01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:23.080]   It's very easy.
[01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:27.800]   Word, I was doing Twitch on Sunday and every single person on the panel said, "Oh yeah,
[01:43:27.800 --> 01:43:28.800]   we use WordPress.
[01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:29.800]   TechCrunch uses WordPress.
[01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:31.040]   Oh yeah, we use WordPress."
[01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:34.800]   Every single person on the panel, Philip Elmer DeWitt.
[01:43:34.800 --> 01:43:36.160]   Yeah, yeah, I use WordPress.
[01:43:36.160 --> 01:43:37.560]   It's just WordPress.com/MacBreak.
[01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:46.760]   Let me thank you so much for supporting my site, leoloport.com, my daughter's site, abioport.com.
[01:43:46.760 --> 01:43:51.280]   Soon my son's site, Henry Laport.com.
[01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:55.840]   So Abby, I mentioned this before, but I registered both my kids' names when they were born so
[01:43:55.840 --> 01:43:59.840]   they would have them and I registered them for 20 years.
[01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:01.560]   They still didn't figure it out.
[01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:05.840]   Abby who's now 26, finally, she said, "Okay, I'm ready."
[01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:06.840]   She said, "What should I do?"
[01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:08.800]   I said, "Well, you go to WordPress.com, set that up.
[01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:10.080]   I've got the domain name.
[01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:11.800]   I'll hook that up."
[01:44:11.800 --> 01:44:14.440]   Took about three minutes to get it all hooked up and it's so great.
[01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:15.520]   Now Henry's doing the same thing.
[01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:20.240]   He said, "I want to post my pictures, but Facebook squeezes them to nothing.
[01:44:20.240 --> 01:44:21.240]   They look terrible."
[01:44:21.240 --> 01:44:23.200]   I said, "Yeah."
[01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:27.400]   Next time I go to up to San Francisco or down to San Francisco to visit Henry, I'm setting
[01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:30.400]   them up, WordPress.com/MacBreak.
[01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:33.080]   Alex, you haven't been here in so long.
[01:44:33.080 --> 01:44:34.080]   Do you have a pick for us?
[01:44:34.080 --> 01:44:35.080]   I have a continuation.
[01:44:35.080 --> 01:44:39.800]   I have a continuation of the conversation that we had the last time, which was there was face
[01:44:39.800 --> 01:44:43.760]   cap, which is the, you can capture the motion on your facial motion.
[01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:51.080]   Now, a week later, after I announced that a Max on, on "Cineversity" released a plugin
[01:44:51.080 --> 01:44:54.480]   that just, I just kind of want to show this because I think this is the stuff that's kind
[01:44:54.480 --> 01:44:56.920]   of coming up next.
[01:44:56.920 --> 01:45:01.240]   And so what you can do here is what Max on it is.
[01:45:01.240 --> 01:45:04.320]   Last time you were here, you took a picture of my face.
[01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:05.320]   I'm still working on that.
[01:45:05.320 --> 01:45:06.320]   It posted the...
[01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:07.320]   There it goes.
[01:45:07.320 --> 01:45:08.320]   There's the creepiest...
[01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:10.400]   The creepiest thing ever.
[01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:12.680]   And you did that with an app on your iPhone.
[01:45:12.680 --> 01:45:14.480]   Yeah, that's with an app that's not...
[01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:17.320]   I don't know if that's released yet, but the...
[01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:20.160]   But we're working on animating it, but one of the things that...
[01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:28.440]   So what Max on did is they basically capture that geometry and will export it straight
[01:45:28.440 --> 01:45:29.440]   to the 3D app.
[01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:30.440]   So you can see...
[01:45:30.440 --> 01:45:31.440]   I don't know if you can see this on...
[01:45:31.440 --> 01:45:32.440]   We can.
[01:45:32.440 --> 01:45:35.080]   But anyway, what it'll do is it'll actually capture the whole animation.
[01:45:35.080 --> 01:45:37.320]   So it'll all the blend shapes and everything else.
[01:45:37.320 --> 01:45:39.320]   And now you can still apply that to another...
[01:45:39.320 --> 01:45:42.120]   You can see that it's applying to a separate object.
[01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:44.680]   So you can tie one object to the other.
[01:45:44.680 --> 01:45:45.680]   But anyway, and this is...
[01:45:45.680 --> 01:45:47.720]   Let me show this again, because this is wild.
[01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:55.040]   You can see as he's talking, he's mapped it to a tin woodman face and it's doing it.
[01:45:55.040 --> 01:45:58.360]   So this is like a Memoji only even more powerful.
[01:45:58.360 --> 01:46:02.480]   Well, and it's Memoji from a professional perspective.
[01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:05.880]   And the reason that this is exciting and the reason I'll probably show more and more things
[01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:10.560]   like this for a little while is because facial animation is one of the hardest things to
[01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:12.400]   do in computer animation.
[01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:14.560]   And it takes a long time.
[01:46:14.560 --> 01:46:15.560]   And this is going to...
[01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:21.320]   I still think this is going to explode in the next...
[01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:24.520]   We get to talk about it now, but in a year or two years, you're going to see maybe even
[01:46:24.520 --> 01:46:25.520]   this fall.
[01:46:25.520 --> 01:46:30.720]   You're going to see an explosion of stuff on YouTube, stuff on small TV, because the
[01:46:30.720 --> 01:46:35.520]   character animation work that you're seeing here is as good as Saturday morning cartoon.
[01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:37.000]   And that's the thing.
[01:46:37.000 --> 01:46:40.800]   It's not as good as Pixar, it's not as good as the next column.
[01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:47.600]   But the point is is that it captures all that geometry and allows you to animate it relatively
[01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:48.600]   quickly.
[01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:53.120]   And this is the first step, is easily getting the data into the 3D app.
[01:46:53.120 --> 01:46:56.800]   I think what's going to happen is we're going to see more of the Memoji type stuff where
[01:46:56.800 --> 01:46:59.680]   you're getting the geometry out of these applications and onto your iPhone and being
[01:46:59.680 --> 01:47:02.880]   able to generate that content actually on your iPhone.
[01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:07.400]   But in the meantime, being able to easily get that facial animation in, this is a lot
[01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:09.160]   of work to get it set up.
[01:47:09.160 --> 01:47:13.920]   But once it's set up, it's just a matter of constantly capturing and exporting and sending
[01:47:13.920 --> 01:47:15.120]   it from your phone.
[01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:23.040]   So anyway, if you use Cinema 4D, it is actually free inside of their training.
[01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:33.840]   It's a cool show of technology that I think we're going to see a lot more of as we go through.
[01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:37.680]   If you think about the AR stuff that we're talking about, think about persistence, right
[01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:40.800]   now they've been talking about, oh, I'll leave with something for someone else to pick up.
[01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:44.520]   But persistence could also be a tour guide that appears and starts talking to you while
[01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:46.520]   you're standing at the museum.
[01:47:46.520 --> 01:47:50.200]   You know, like they're going to go in and it's going to be really a lot cheaper to have
[01:47:50.200 --> 01:47:54.720]   that tour guide talking to you if with technologies like this where you can use your iPhone and
[01:47:54.720 --> 01:47:56.920]   have them record, you know, what they have to do.
[01:47:56.920 --> 01:47:59.680]   And again, there's lots of really expensive tools to do this.
[01:47:59.680 --> 01:48:03.320]   This is just the fact that it's now something you can do with your iPhone.
[01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:04.320]   Very neat.
[01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:05.320]   It's cool.
[01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:06.320]   Anyway.
[01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:07.800]   So where should we find out more about this?
[01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:15.720]   If you go to Syniversity, I think it's actually on their front page and C-I-N-E-V-E-R-S-I-T-Y.com.
[01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:16.720]   Yeah.
[01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:20.800]   So it's Syniversity and you go to their front page, you'll see this video and it's worth
[01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:25.360]   watching the video just to see how it works.
[01:48:25.360 --> 01:48:28.880]   It's worth watching the video just a glimpse into the future.
[01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:33.640]   If you actually have Cinema 4D or you can actually download the plugin and...
[01:48:33.640 --> 01:48:37.760]   Coming soon to an automatically generated YouTube video near you.
[01:48:37.760 --> 01:48:38.760]   Oh, yeah.
[01:48:38.760 --> 01:48:39.760]   This is going to be...
[01:48:39.760 --> 01:48:40.760]   Yeah.
[01:48:40.760 --> 01:48:41.760]   Programmatic videos have never looked at it.
[01:48:41.760 --> 01:48:42.760]   It's not programmatic though.
[01:48:42.760 --> 01:48:43.760]   That's the thing.
[01:48:43.760 --> 01:48:44.760]   It could be though.
[01:48:44.760 --> 01:48:48.400]   But what's cool about this is that it's actually you being able to...
[01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:49.400]   It's a real performance.
[01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:50.400]   A performance.
[01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:51.400]   And getting your performance on there.
[01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:54.680]   And people have been struggling with this my entire career.
[01:48:54.680 --> 01:48:56.680]   And so that's why I'm so proud of it.
[01:48:56.680 --> 01:49:00.520]   So in a couple of years, I won't have to come into work.
[01:49:00.520 --> 01:49:03.320]   I'll just put a 3D thing here and I can stay in bed and do more.
[01:49:03.320 --> 01:49:04.320]   I'm working on it.
[01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:05.320]   That's why I scanned it.
[01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:06.320]   That would be awesome.
[01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:07.320]   I'm really awesome.
[01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:08.320]   We're working on it.
[01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:09.320]   And you know, we'll just...
[01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:10.320]   Yeah.
[01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:16.400]   We're a news reporter, a radio news reporter who has a sad disease.
[01:49:16.400 --> 01:49:18.800]   Once I read about it, I thought, God, I hope this never happens to me.
[01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:20.560]   It's lost control of his tongue.
[01:49:20.560 --> 01:49:25.280]   So every time he times to speak in the phone he thought and he loses the ability to speak.
[01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:27.840]   And they tried all sorts of things, Botox and everything.
[01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:29.680]   But what they've ended up doing is they synthesis...
[01:49:29.680 --> 01:49:30.840]   He's a radio reporter.
[01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:34.200]   So they have hundreds of hours of audio, thousands probably.
[01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:39.280]   They synthesized his voice and now he writes his stories and they're delivered by a computer.
[01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:40.280]   Sounds a little robotic.
[01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:41.280]   I didn't...
[01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:42.280]   Did Roger Ebert do that?
[01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:44.280]   He had a synthesizer.
[01:49:44.280 --> 01:49:45.280]   Yeah.
[01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:49.000]   Well, he had a synthesizer, but also this is like five, six, seven years ago.
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:52.440]   But a company I think in Ireland was using recordings of...
[01:49:52.440 --> 01:49:59.280]   He'd done a bunch of studio recordings of like commentary tracks and other stuff too.
[01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:03.360]   And they built a beta version of the voice that he was going to be using.
[01:50:03.360 --> 01:50:07.520]   Although he loved the English-accented voice.
[01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:09.520]   He used to call it Sir Lawrence of Olivier.
[01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:12.360]   I wonder if we still give readings.
[01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:13.360]   I wonder if it's him coming.
[01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:15.360]   This is a Scottish company.
[01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:17.800]   Oh, but it's the same company.
[01:50:17.800 --> 01:50:18.800]   So...
[01:50:18.800 --> 01:50:23.640]   But I remember when I was talking to him about it privately, he was saying how...
[01:50:23.640 --> 01:50:30.600]   He was optimistic not just for giving him a more natural voice, but also telling me how
[01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:34.960]   easy this would have been for this company, for these engineers, if before he went in...
[01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:37.760]   If he knew, if he had known before he went in for his surgery, that he's going to lose
[01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:43.520]   his voice, that simply spent like an hour recording exactly the phonomes that they needed.
[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:45.240]   It would have been very, very simple.
[01:50:45.240 --> 01:50:50.800]   And so the idea of maybe having this as just an anticipatory assistive device so that we're
[01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:53.520]   going, before you go into surgery, we're going to record...
[01:50:53.520 --> 01:50:56.720]   We're going to get all the stuff we need to assemble a really good synthetic voice for
[01:50:56.720 --> 01:50:58.840]   you that your family will recognize.
[01:50:58.840 --> 01:51:00.560]   I should probably lay down some tracks.
[01:51:00.560 --> 01:51:02.560]   For some reason, when you said that, I was thinking about it.
[01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:06.600]   It's really cool to just have an app that, or be able to go somewhere and do that anyway.
[01:51:06.600 --> 01:51:08.400]   Just do it now.
[01:51:08.400 --> 01:51:11.400]   Or everyone to have your kids do it now.
[01:51:11.400 --> 01:51:12.400]   Save their voice.
[01:51:12.400 --> 01:51:13.400]   Does it change?
[01:51:13.400 --> 01:51:14.400]   I would.
[01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:15.400]   Yeah.
[01:51:15.400 --> 01:51:16.400]   That's something that I would like...
[01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:18.600]   So that when they're 30, they still sound like they're 10?
[01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:20.080]   Yeah, if they wanted to.
[01:51:20.080 --> 01:51:22.080]   If they only wanted to.
[01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:27.720]   For the opportunities for mischief, skullduggery, or actual illegal stuff, I would like to record
[01:51:27.720 --> 01:51:31.960]   that to actual audio tape and then leave that someplace secure.
[01:51:31.960 --> 01:51:32.960]   Yeah.
[01:51:32.960 --> 01:51:33.960]   No one can get that.
[01:51:33.960 --> 01:51:38.800]   I wouldn't trust a phone app that simply sends it to a server, let's say.
[01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:41.160]   You have a pick of the week, Mr. Annie and I go?
[01:51:41.160 --> 01:51:42.280]   Yes, I do.
[01:51:42.280 --> 01:51:47.360]   We mentioned the beloved, Sal Sigullian, earlier in the show.
[01:51:47.360 --> 01:51:52.520]   I actually already had, as my pick of the week, a boot camp, a three-day boot camp of
[01:51:52.520 --> 01:51:56.560]   scripting that he's hosting in Atlanta in October.
[01:51:56.560 --> 01:51:59.760]   Let's see, last year they did a conference called the Masters of Automation.
[01:51:59.760 --> 01:52:06.160]   This is the Command D Masters of Automation Down Home Scripting Boot Camp October 15th
[01:52:06.160 --> 01:52:09.600]   17th in Carter'sville, Georgia.
[01:52:09.600 --> 01:52:12.160]   So this is really, really special.
[01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:18.400]   This is he and another, almost similar equipped expert.
[01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:23.080]   We'll just, again, just these two guys are going to spend three days teaching a limited
[01:52:23.080 --> 01:52:26.080]   number of students all about scripting on the Mac.
[01:52:26.080 --> 01:52:32.880]   This is like, if like, Sir Isaac Newton had a three-day conference on calculus.
[01:52:32.880 --> 01:52:38.400]   This is the guy who was pretty much responsible for scripting on the Mac.
[01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:39.880]   The first day is introductory stuff.
[01:52:39.880 --> 01:52:41.960]   The second day is advanced stuff.
[01:52:41.960 --> 01:52:46.280]   Then the third day is here's practical stuff for applying all the stuff that you've done.
[01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:50.480]   It's going to be very, very hands-on and very, very not.
[01:52:50.480 --> 01:52:55.280]   It's not like Sal's going to be there for like a half-hour keynote and then he's going
[01:52:55.280 --> 01:52:58.280]   golfing and then he'll come back in three days for a dinner.
[01:52:58.280 --> 01:53:02.920]   This is really, you're going to be learning from Sal how to do scripting.
[01:53:02.920 --> 01:53:08.920]   And also I have been informed by reliably close sources that, of course, of course, they're
[01:53:08.920 --> 01:53:13.480]   aware of Siri shortcuts and all the other automation stuff that was announced last week.
[01:53:13.480 --> 01:53:17.280]   So yes, the conference will also address stuff like that.
[01:53:17.280 --> 01:53:23.800]   As a matter of fact, he's been doing a lot of scripting integration between iOS and
[01:53:23.800 --> 01:53:26.600]   the Omni Group's Omni products.
[01:53:26.600 --> 01:53:30.800]   And on the omni-automation.com website, I don't think it's up there now, but I believe
[01:53:30.800 --> 01:53:37.280]   in soon you'll see his first experiments with creating Siri shortcuts that actually just
[01:53:37.280 --> 01:53:41.320]   interact directly with the Omni Group apps.
[01:53:41.320 --> 01:53:48.640]   Like being able to say, "Hey, Shlomo, create a new action for my Omni to-do list."
[01:53:48.640 --> 01:53:50.200]   And boom, it just simply happens.
[01:53:50.200 --> 01:53:55.280]   So I can't imagine if you are in the business of supporting Macs and automation Macs, particularly
[01:53:55.280 --> 01:53:59.160]   if you're an education, I'm guessing this is going to be some of the best money you'll
[01:53:59.160 --> 01:54:01.160]   ever spend.
[01:54:01.160 --> 01:54:06.800]   Even if it's just three days hanging out with Sal, if they were did like a Mac developer
[01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:13.800]   fantasy camp or you're not an actual Apple developer, but you get to take batting practice
[01:54:13.800 --> 01:54:14.800]   with actual...
[01:54:14.800 --> 01:54:17.640]   And you get to pretend you're a real Apple developer.
[01:54:17.640 --> 01:54:20.840]   Even for that for three days, I think this would be a good investment of money.
[01:54:20.840 --> 01:54:22.200]   But you'll learn more.
[01:54:22.200 --> 01:54:24.640]   You'll do more than just hit pop flies.
[01:54:24.640 --> 01:54:30.280]   CMDD, C-O-N-F.com.
[01:54:30.280 --> 01:54:31.280]   CMD...
[01:54:31.280 --> 01:54:37.360]   It's hard to find because unfortunately, Command-D has a lot of other Google results.
[01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:40.360]   So CMDD, C-O-N-F.com.
[01:54:40.360 --> 01:54:45.200]   I think if you just type in...
[01:54:45.200 --> 01:54:47.120]   What happens if you just type in Sal's conference?
[01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:48.640]   Oh, yeah, that might work.
[01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:50.200]   Sal's conference.
[01:54:50.200 --> 01:54:52.520]   That's probably a better idea.
[01:54:52.520 --> 01:54:53.520]   Does it work?
[01:54:53.520 --> 01:54:54.520]   Oh, no.
[01:54:54.520 --> 01:54:55.520]   Oh, yeah.
[01:54:55.520 --> 01:54:56.520]   Yeah.
[01:54:56.520 --> 01:54:57.680]   Darn SEO.
[01:54:57.680 --> 01:55:01.680]   So if you're in Cartersville, Georgia, or you could be an Octo...
[01:55:01.680 --> 01:55:04.080]   There you go, Sal's scripting conference.
[01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:05.080]   Okay.
[01:55:05.080 --> 01:55:06.080]   There you go.
[01:55:06.080 --> 01:55:08.680]   One, two, the first 20, the first 10 results.
[01:55:08.680 --> 01:55:09.880]   I love it.
[01:55:09.880 --> 01:55:11.120]   That looks like so much fun.
[01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:13.200]   God, I'd love to do something like this.
[01:55:13.200 --> 01:55:14.920]   What fun is that, huh?
[01:55:14.920 --> 01:55:17.880]   Laurie Gill, you got a pick for us?
[01:55:17.880 --> 01:55:22.880]   Can my pick be looking behind Andy's screen?
[01:55:22.880 --> 01:55:26.400]   That's not a pick.
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:28.400]   That's a command.
[01:55:28.400 --> 01:55:29.400]   I'm saving the...
[01:55:29.400 --> 01:55:30.400]   That's a request.
[01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:31.880]   I'm saving that for the last episode.
[01:55:31.880 --> 01:55:33.200]   Oh, my God.
[01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:35.000]   What's behind Andy's screen?
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:37.280]   Now you've brought up all sorts of interesting questions.
[01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:39.800]   I think about it every time I'm on the show.
[01:55:39.800 --> 01:55:40.800]   Oh, you're so funny.
[01:55:40.800 --> 01:55:42.040]   Well, we can see what's behind you.
[01:55:42.040 --> 01:55:45.640]   You're very open and forthright about your stuff.
[01:55:45.640 --> 01:55:52.080]   Yeah, my Star Wars pictures and my Disneyland map and that picture that's behind my head...
[01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:54.080]   Wait, I'm backward.
[01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:55.080]   Okay.
[01:55:55.080 --> 01:55:56.080]   The picture that's behind my head.
[01:55:56.080 --> 01:55:58.240]   I can't get out of the way.
[01:55:58.240 --> 01:55:59.240]   Someone gave it to me.
[01:55:59.240 --> 01:56:04.920]   It's actually a picture of a elephant dressed as a bantha.
[01:56:04.920 --> 01:56:08.080]   I believe it's the San Diego Zoo.
[01:56:08.080 --> 01:56:09.080]   And it was...
[01:56:09.080 --> 01:56:10.080]   That's a story.
[01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:11.080]   It's from 1977.
[01:56:11.080 --> 01:56:13.080]   It's just an elephant like a bantha.
[01:56:13.080 --> 01:56:14.080]   That's crazy.
[01:56:14.080 --> 01:56:16.600]   I hope they didn't cut its insides open for warmth.
[01:56:16.600 --> 01:56:17.600]   Oh, God.
[01:56:17.600 --> 01:56:18.600]   No.
[01:56:18.600 --> 01:56:19.600]   No, that was the tantan.
[01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:20.600]   Oh, that was a tantan.
[01:56:20.600 --> 01:56:21.600]   Not a bantha.
[01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:22.600]   Right, of course.
[01:56:22.600 --> 01:56:23.600]   So, some of my pick then.
[01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:24.600]   Banthas are just...
[01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:25.600]   They're in the desert.
[01:56:25.600 --> 01:56:27.780]   You don't need to keep them...
[01:56:27.780 --> 01:56:29.780]   Keep warm in Tatooine.
[01:56:29.780 --> 01:56:30.780]   Oh, man.
[01:56:30.780 --> 01:56:33.840]   I got to work on my Star Wars, right?
[01:56:33.840 --> 01:56:35.600]   Star Wars knowledge.
[01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:36.600]   Okay.
[01:56:36.600 --> 01:56:37.940]   Yes.
[01:56:37.940 --> 01:56:38.940]   Star Wars.
[01:56:38.940 --> 01:56:39.940]   Okay.
[01:56:39.940 --> 01:56:47.740]   So, my pick is going to be the Nomad Battery Cable that I just got this and it's pretty
[01:56:47.740 --> 01:56:48.740]   fantastic.
[01:56:48.740 --> 01:56:49.980]   I use Nomad cables.
[01:56:49.980 --> 01:56:51.060]   I love them.
[01:56:51.060 --> 01:56:52.060]   I do too.
[01:56:52.060 --> 01:56:55.020]   They're so rugged and strong and they work really well.
[01:56:55.020 --> 01:56:56.980]   So, this is...
[01:56:56.980 --> 01:57:01.420]   It's a lightning cable, but it has its own portable battery attached to it.
[01:57:01.420 --> 01:57:07.460]   So, if you are out and about and you don't have the ability to plug in your phone to
[01:57:07.460 --> 01:57:11.260]   your computer, you just plug it into this cable and it'll charge your phone.
[01:57:11.260 --> 01:57:12.380]   It'll charge an iPhone X.
[01:57:12.380 --> 01:57:14.780]   This is an updated version of it.
[01:57:14.780 --> 01:57:21.020]   The new one actually charges the iPhone X, iPhone 8, 8 plus, the previous one I think
[01:57:21.020 --> 01:57:25.020]   struggled to reach the max that the iPhone tended.
[01:57:25.020 --> 01:57:26.660]   But I used it.
[01:57:26.660 --> 01:57:31.100]   It charged my iPhone X from 20% to 100% in about an hour and a half.
[01:57:31.100 --> 01:57:32.100]   So, it's small.
[01:57:32.100 --> 01:57:33.100]   It's light.
[01:57:33.100 --> 01:57:34.100]   It's a little thing.
[01:57:34.100 --> 01:57:39.260]   But what makes it super awesome is you don't also have to bring a lightning cable with you
[01:57:39.260 --> 01:57:46.500]   if you are bringing your Mac computer with you or even a wall plug, just bring this.
[01:57:46.500 --> 01:57:52.740]   And it replaces your lightning cable and when you're out and about, it acts as a charger.
[01:57:52.740 --> 01:57:54.540]   So, it's fantastic.
[01:57:54.540 --> 01:57:58.780]   I didn't know this existed until a couple of weeks ago and I'm so happy that I have
[01:57:58.780 --> 01:57:59.780]   this now.
[01:57:59.780 --> 01:58:00.780]   This is all.
[01:58:00.780 --> 01:58:02.140]   I will keep this in the car that way.
[01:58:02.140 --> 01:58:03.340]   It'll always be charged.
[01:58:03.340 --> 01:58:07.220]   And then if I need it, I can just take it out and take it places.
[01:58:07.220 --> 01:58:08.220]   Nice.
[01:58:08.220 --> 01:58:09.820]   Nomads cables are braided.
[01:58:09.820 --> 01:58:12.180]   They're really tough.
[01:58:12.180 --> 01:58:15.860]   This one is a 2800 milliamp hours and it's $50.
[01:58:15.860 --> 01:58:19.580]   The battery cable from Nomad.
[01:58:19.580 --> 01:58:20.580]   Very nice.
[01:58:20.580 --> 01:58:22.260]   I'm getting one right now.
[01:58:22.260 --> 01:58:23.260]   Thank you, Lori Gill.
[01:58:23.260 --> 01:58:24.980]   Oh, you're welcome.
[01:58:24.980 --> 01:58:26.140]   Thank you for being here too.
[01:58:26.140 --> 01:58:27.140]   We appreciate it.
[01:58:27.140 --> 01:58:29.740]   Lori is the deputy managing editor at imore.com.
[01:58:29.740 --> 01:58:31.220]   She's on the Twitter, Apoholic.
[01:58:31.220 --> 01:58:32.220]   Anything else you want to plug?
[01:58:32.220 --> 01:58:33.700]   You got a performance coming up?
[01:58:33.700 --> 01:58:35.140]   One of your many bands?
[01:58:35.140 --> 01:58:36.140]   I do, actually.
[01:58:36.140 --> 01:58:37.340]   We just recorded a demo.
[01:58:37.340 --> 01:58:45.700]   So I went to the WWDC and I had to leave early because on Wednesday night, I had to
[01:58:45.700 --> 01:58:47.180]   play a show.
[01:58:47.180 --> 01:58:50.780]   And then on Saturday and Sunday, I recorded a demo.
[01:58:50.780 --> 01:58:52.580]   So my band world has been just kind of...
[01:58:52.580 --> 01:58:54.380]   Now I understand why you're a little horse.
[01:58:54.380 --> 01:58:56.380]   You've been singing your little heart out.
[01:58:56.380 --> 01:58:58.140]   I have been, yeah.
[01:58:58.140 --> 01:58:59.140]   Wow.
[01:58:59.140 --> 01:59:00.940]   Lori is a sings, by the way.
[01:59:00.940 --> 01:59:05.060]   She doesn't sing like catacles or madrigals.
[01:59:05.060 --> 01:59:07.220]   She's a hardcore rocker.
[01:59:07.220 --> 01:59:08.220]   Yeah.
[01:59:08.220 --> 01:59:10.540]   I pretty much belted out pretty hard.
[01:59:10.540 --> 01:59:12.180]   Is it hard on your voice?
[01:59:12.180 --> 01:59:13.180]   Oh, yeah.
[01:59:13.180 --> 01:59:16.580]   I haven't had a normal voice in years.
[01:59:16.580 --> 01:59:20.580]   It's permanently damaged my voice, but it's worth it because I love to be a front man and
[01:59:20.580 --> 01:59:21.580]   show off.
[01:59:21.580 --> 01:59:22.580]   So wonderful.
[01:59:22.580 --> 01:59:23.980]   Where can we get the new demo?
[01:59:23.980 --> 01:59:24.980]   Where is it going to be?
[01:59:24.980 --> 01:59:25.980]   What's a...
[01:59:25.980 --> 01:59:28.940]   You know, the demo we're not going to put up online.
[01:59:28.940 --> 01:59:34.660]   We eventually someday will put it up on SoundCloud, but for now it's just going to be on a tape,
[01:59:34.660 --> 01:59:38.140]   on an actual tape that we hand out at shows that we're at.
[01:59:38.140 --> 01:59:40.140]   So you've got to go to the show.
[01:59:40.140 --> 01:59:41.940]   You've got to go to the show.
[01:59:41.940 --> 01:59:46.300]   You want to see Lori, you've got to go see her in Sacramento.
[01:59:46.300 --> 01:59:47.460]   All right.
[01:59:47.460 --> 01:59:48.460]   Okay.
[01:59:48.460 --> 01:59:49.460]   That's good.
[01:59:49.460 --> 01:59:51.980]   Do you tweet out your show locations?
[01:59:51.980 --> 01:59:52.980]   You must.
[01:59:52.980 --> 01:59:55.380]   No, not Twitter.
[01:59:55.380 --> 01:59:58.420]   Facebook, I'll put things up through Facebook.
[01:59:58.420 --> 02:00:01.420]   And I also hand out Flares because I do everything.
[02:00:01.420 --> 02:00:02.420]   I'm in my 40s.
[02:00:02.420 --> 02:00:06.380]   I do everything like I did when I was 18.
[02:00:06.380 --> 02:00:08.660]   Fliers, tapes.
[02:00:08.660 --> 02:00:10.220]   Wow.
[02:00:10.220 --> 02:00:13.100]   Search for RAD on Facebook.
[02:00:13.100 --> 02:00:14.460]   That's the name of the band.
[02:00:14.460 --> 02:00:16.460]   Oh, actually, yeah, I forgot.
[02:00:16.460 --> 02:00:17.740]   This is actually a different band.
[02:00:17.740 --> 02:00:18.740]   This is Sickburn.
[02:00:18.740 --> 02:00:21.300]   Oh, see, you've got too many bands.
[02:00:21.300 --> 02:00:22.300]   I do.
[02:00:22.300 --> 02:00:23.300]   I told you I'm in a bunch of bands.
[02:00:23.300 --> 02:00:24.300]   I was not a joke.
[02:00:24.300 --> 02:00:27.300]   Is it facebook.com/sickburn?
[02:00:27.300 --> 02:00:28.300]   I think so.
[02:00:28.300 --> 02:00:31.420]   This is a freaking awesome name for a band, by the way.
[02:00:31.420 --> 02:00:32.420]   I know.
[02:00:32.420 --> 02:00:33.420]   That's pretty funny.
[02:00:33.420 --> 02:00:34.420]   Sickburn.
[02:00:34.420 --> 02:00:35.420]   Wow.
[02:00:35.420 --> 02:00:36.420]   Sickburn, man.
[02:00:36.420 --> 02:00:37.420]   There it is.
[02:00:37.420 --> 02:00:38.420]   Yeah, that's sickburn.
[02:00:38.420 --> 02:00:39.420]   Yeah.
[02:00:39.420 --> 02:00:40.420]   Very nice.
[02:00:40.420 --> 02:00:41.420]   Thank you, Lori.
[02:00:41.420 --> 02:00:42.420]   Hey, no problem.
[02:00:42.420 --> 02:00:44.420]   Thanks for letting me plug my band.
[02:00:44.420 --> 02:00:45.420]   Oh, no.
[02:00:45.420 --> 02:00:46.900]   Hell, I don't pay you.
[02:00:46.900 --> 02:00:49.940]   You got to get you got to get some of this.
[02:00:49.940 --> 02:00:53.300]   Andy and I go he has nothing to plug except his website.
[02:00:53.300 --> 02:00:55.380]   I have nothing to plug.com.
[02:00:55.380 --> 02:00:58.140]   No, I H N A T K O dot com.
[02:00:58.140 --> 02:01:04.260]   I am going to be on Boston Public Radio again on Friday, probably talking about WWDC, probably
[02:01:04.260 --> 02:01:06.980]   talking about E three, probably talking about other stuff too.
[02:01:06.980 --> 02:01:08.300]   So you'll be able to.
[02:01:08.300 --> 02:01:13.940]   I think it's going to be 1245 until like 115 or whatever.
[02:01:13.940 --> 02:01:14.940]   Eastern time.
[02:01:14.940 --> 02:01:21.140]   But if you go to WGBH dot org or WGBH news, you'll be able to listen to it live, stream
[02:01:21.140 --> 02:01:22.740]   it live or stream it later.
[02:01:22.740 --> 02:01:30.020]   G B H the king of public radio grew up listening to G H. I effect that's where it's for.
[02:01:30.020 --> 02:01:31.020]   Yeah, right.
[02:01:31.020 --> 02:01:32.020]   Zoom.
[02:01:32.020 --> 02:01:35.940]   It's where I first heard the hitchhiker's guide to Galaxy was the galaxy was on WGBH.
[02:01:35.940 --> 02:01:36.940]   They read the right.
[02:01:36.940 --> 02:01:42.140]   You know, growing up in Boston, it's like there is nothing cooler than being a regular
[02:01:42.140 --> 02:01:44.140]   on the on WGBH.
[02:01:44.140 --> 02:01:45.700]   That's a legendary legendary.
[02:01:45.700 --> 02:01:47.460]   I can still I can still hear the open.
[02:01:47.460 --> 02:01:49.460]   I like from all the.
[02:01:49.460 --> 02:01:54.460]   They do it.
[02:01:54.460 --> 02:01:56.340]   Alex Lindsey, Pixel core.
[02:01:56.340 --> 02:02:02.460]   Go to Alex Lindsey on the Twitter a L E X L I N D S a Y. That's where he really puts everything.
[02:02:02.460 --> 02:02:03.460]   Right?
[02:02:03.460 --> 02:02:06.780]   I'm talking I'm talking about live streaming in New York on June 26th.
[02:02:06.780 --> 02:02:08.820]   I just tweeted out the link.
[02:02:08.820 --> 02:02:09.820]   Cool.
[02:02:09.820 --> 02:02:10.820]   And it's free.

[02:02:12.140 --> 02:02:13.140]   Yeah.
[02:02:13.140 --> 02:02:15.940]   I want to listen to me talk about live streaming for three hours.
[02:02:15.940 --> 02:02:17.740]   I know that sounds rough, but no.
[02:02:17.740 --> 02:02:24.740]   I've got a lot of questions, you know, but I'm going to talk at at it's at a ramma as
[02:02:24.740 --> 02:02:26.780]   a thing called the inspire conference.
[02:02:26.780 --> 02:02:28.260]   And so oh, it's with that.
[02:02:28.260 --> 02:02:29.980]   I love I love them all the time.
[02:02:29.980 --> 02:02:30.980]   I love that.
[02:02:30.980 --> 02:02:34.700]   So if you're in New York on the 26th or feel like you want to be on, it's free for a couple
[02:02:34.700 --> 02:02:38.700]   hours and you can ask questions and heckle me and all those fun stuff.
[02:02:38.700 --> 02:02:39.700]   I didn't see this.
[02:02:39.700 --> 02:02:41.460]   What the hell is that?
[02:02:41.460 --> 02:02:42.540]   I posted that.
[02:02:42.540 --> 02:02:46.540]   That was so you would that was from that was from that was from when remember I took the
[02:02:46.540 --> 02:02:47.540]   call for help.
[02:02:47.540 --> 02:02:50.540]   Oh, this is I threw it back into photo scan.
[02:02:50.540 --> 02:02:52.060]   Like I found the photos.
[02:02:52.060 --> 02:02:53.060]   Oh my God.
[02:02:53.060 --> 02:02:55.620]   And that is the that's how we used to do it kids.
[02:02:55.620 --> 02:02:56.620]   I don't know.
[02:02:56.620 --> 02:02:59.780]   This is using that's the old photos with the new technology.
[02:02:59.780 --> 02:03:02.180]   So it actually didn't work as well.
[02:03:02.180 --> 02:03:04.340]   It doesn't work as well as the capture that you did.
[02:03:04.340 --> 02:03:05.340]   Yeah.
[02:03:05.340 --> 02:03:06.660]   With the with the phone in about three seconds.
[02:03:06.660 --> 02:03:11.660]   I know that it has God, I look terrible in that, but that's how I look.
[02:03:11.660 --> 02:03:13.220]   What are you going to do?
[02:03:13.220 --> 02:03:16.340]   Three D doesn't lie.
[02:03:16.340 --> 02:03:20.380]   You do it will it will after Alex is done with it.
[02:03:20.380 --> 02:03:23.700]   And you just clean up a little bit get some of the bags out.
[02:03:23.700 --> 02:03:28.620]   We do this show every Tuesday, 11 am Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern time, 1800 UTC.
[02:03:28.620 --> 02:03:30.100]   You can come and watch us in studio.
[02:03:30.100 --> 02:03:35.220]   We had a great studio audience today from all over the place from the UK from London
[02:03:35.220 --> 02:03:38.740]   from Pittsburgh, your stomping grounds from Seattle.
[02:03:38.740 --> 02:03:39.740]   Awesome.
[02:03:39.740 --> 02:03:43.060]   Nice to have you Jeff Bezos in the studio audience today.
[02:03:43.060 --> 02:03:47.300]   If you want to be here, we do ask the email tickets at twit.tv not that the tickets cost
[02:03:47.300 --> 02:03:52.060]   anything, but we just like to know so we can put a chair out for you.
[02:03:52.060 --> 02:03:54.540]   No, no charge, but you got to be in the Petaloma area.
[02:03:54.540 --> 02:03:55.540]   Okay.
[02:03:55.540 --> 02:03:56.860]   That's the only caveat.
[02:03:56.860 --> 02:03:59.460]   You can also watch the stream anywhere in the world.
[02:03:59.460 --> 02:04:01.220]   Twit.tv/live is the best place.
[02:04:01.220 --> 02:04:05.300]   You get your choice there of all the different stream providers, which may be changing.
[02:04:05.300 --> 02:04:08.580]   Things are moving around a little bit, but there's new and there's old.
[02:04:08.580 --> 02:04:10.780]   So we'll have something there for you.
[02:04:10.780 --> 02:04:12.820]   Twit.tv/live.

[02:04:20.460 --> 02:04:26.540]   the fact at twit.tv in the case of this shows twit.tv/mbw.
[02:04:26.540 --> 02:04:28.900]   You can also subscribe.
[02:04:28.900 --> 02:04:32.340]   Every podcast application should have a link to Mac very quickly.
[02:04:32.340 --> 02:04:34.860]   Subscribe and you'll get it the minute it's available.
[02:04:34.860 --> 02:04:35.860]   Thanks for joining us.
